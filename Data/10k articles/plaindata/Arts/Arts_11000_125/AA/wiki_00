The film focuses on Wuornos' declining mental state and the questionable judgment to execute her despite her being of unsound mind.\n\nThe film focuses on an evidentiary hearing held in Marion County, Florida in February 2003, which was the site of some but not all of Wuornos' murders for which she was convicted and sentenced to death. It shows the work of the Office of Capital Collateral Regional counsel, led by attorney Joseph T. Hobson, who is both interviewed and featured in the film and who seeks to vacate Wuornos' death sentences. It shows Judge Victor Musleh presiding over these proceedings and assistant state attorney, now judge, James McCune, who defended the death sentences for the State of Florida. Hobson is shown vigorously cross-examining Wuornos' trial counsel, Steven Glazer, aka \"Dr. Legal\". Glazer was the unflattering subject of a prior Broomfield documentary on Aileen Wuornos, \"\". It was Hobson's line of attack that the efficacy of his client's (Wuornos') trial strategy was compromised by Glazer's pecuniary and self-promotional aims.\n\nThe film climaxes in a final interview with Wuornos one day before her execution. In the interview, she states that she was tortured while in prison and claims that the prison used \"sonic pressure\" to control or alter her mental state. In a fit of rage, Wuornos rails against a society that she says \"railroaded my ass\" before abruptly ending the interview. Broomfield comments that he finds it hard to understand how the same person in front of him was deemed \"of sound mind\" the day before by Florida governor Jeb Bush's psychiatric examiners.\n\nThe film concludes with footage of a prison spokesman reading Wuornos' final statement at a press conference after her execution: \"I'm sailing with the Rock, and I'll be back. Like \"Independence Day\" with Jesus, June 6, like the movie, big mothership and all. I'll be back.\"\n\nThe film received a limited theatrical release in North America several weeks after the Aileen Wuornos biopic \"Monster\" opened to generally positive reviews. Released on January 9, 2004, on three screens, \"Aileen\" grossed $16,158 (averagely $5,386 per screen) in its opening weekend. Playing in six theaters at its widest point, its total North American box office gross stands at just $97,362.\n"}

She received a B.S. degree in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1983, and a Ph.D. degree in polymer science and engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1991 as a member of the Air Force ROTC. She was advised by Professor Thomas J. McCarthy on her doctorate. She was a member of the intercollegiate crew and was a resident of Baker House.\n\nAfter completing her regular education, Coleman joined the U.S. Air Force as a Second Lieutenant while continuing her graduate work for a PhD at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In 1988 she entered active duty at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as a research chemist. During her work she participated as a surface analysis consultant on the NASA Long Duration Exposure Facility experiment. In 1991, she received her doctorate in polymer science and engineering. She retired from the Air Force in November 2009.\n\nColeman was selected by NASA in 1992 to join the NASA Astronaut Corps. In 1995, she was a member of the STS-73 crew on the scientific mission USML-2 with experiments including biotechnology, combustion science, and the physics of fluids. During the flight, she reported to Houston Mission Control that she had spotted an unidentified flying object. She also trained for the mission STS-83 to be the backup for Donald A. Thomas; however, as he recovered on time, she did not fly that mission. STS-93 was Coleman's second space flight in 1999. She was mission specialist in charge of deploying the Chandra X-ray Observatory and its Inertial Upper Stage out of the shuttle's cargo bay.\n\nColeman served as Chief of Robotics for the Astronaut Office, to include robotic arm operations and training for all Space Shuttle and International Space Station missions. In October 2004, Coleman served as an aquanaut during the mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for eleven days.\n\nColeman was assigned as a backup U.S. crew member for Expeditions 19, 20 and 21 and served as a backup crew member for Expeditions 24 and 25 as part of her training for Expedition 26.\n\nColeman launched on December 15, 2010 (December 16 Baikonur time), aboard Soyuz TMA-20 to join the Expedition 26 mission aboard the International Space Station. She retired from NASA on December 1, 2016.\n\nSTS-73 on Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" (October 20 to November 5, 1995) was the second United States Microgravity Laboratory mission. The mission focused on materials science, biotechnology, combustion science, the physics of fluids, and numerous scientific experiments housed in the pressurized Spacelab module. In completing her first space flight, Coleman orbited the Earth 256 times, traveled over 6 million miles, and logged a total of 15 days, 21 hours, 52 minutes and 21 seconds in space.\n\nSTS-93 on \"Columbia\" (July 22 to 27, 1999) was a five-day mission during which Coleman was the lead mission specialist for the deployment of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Designed to conduct comprehensive studies of the universe, the telescope will enable scientists to study exotic phenomena such as exploding stars, quasars, and black holes. Mission duration was 118 hours and 50 minutes.\n\nSoyuz TMA-20 / Expedition 26/27 (December 15, 2010, to May 23, 2011) was an extended duration mission to the International Space Station.\n\nColeman is married to glass artist Josh Simpson who lives in Massachusetts. They have one son. She is part of the band Bandella, which also includes fellow NASA astronaut Steven Robinson, Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, and Micki Pettit (astronaut Don Pettit's wife). Coleman is a flute player and has taken several flutes with her to the ISS, including a pennywhistle from Paddy Moloney of the Chieftains, an old Irish flute from Matt Molloy of the Chieftains, and a flute from Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull. On February 15, 2011, she played one of the instruments live from orbit on National Public Radio. On April 12, 2011, she played live through video link for the audience of Jethro Tull's show in Russia in honour of the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight. She played the duet from orbit while Anderson played on the ground in Russia. On May 13 of that year, Coleman delivered a taped commencement address to the class of 2011 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\nAs do many other astronauts, Coleman holds an amateur radio license (callsign: KC5ZTH).\n\nAs of 2015, she is also a member of the board of directors for the Hollywood Science Fiction Museum.\n\nAs of 2015 she is also known to be working as a guest speaker at the Baylor College of Medicine, for the children's program 'Saturday Morning Science'.\n\n"}

This imagery has been in use since at least the mid-14th century. The syrenka has traditionally held a silver sword although this does not appear on more recent versions.\n\nThe first coat of arms of Warsaw depicted a dragon with a male human head, carrying a sword and a shield. The first known usage was on a seal from 1390. This is the oldest existing armed seal of Warsaw, consisting of a round seal bordered with the Latin inscription \"Sigilium Civitatis Varsoviensis\" (Seal of the city of Warsaw). Gradually the male head and body was replaced with that of a female, and by the end of 16th century the tail was also changed from that of a dragon to that of a fish. The only remaining parts of the original coat of arms are the sword and shield.\n\nBeginning in the early 17th century Warsaw records associate a sword-wielding mermaid with the city. Since 1622, the Warsaw arms have been rendered as a mermaid with sword and shield in hand, representing Melusina from the River Vistula (Wisła), who in legend led Duke Bolesław II of Masovia (1262–1313) to the appropriate site (a fishing village) and ordered him to found the city, in about 1294. The origin of the legendary figure is not fully known. The city's motto is, appropriately, \"Contemnit procellas\" (\"It defies the storms\").\n\nThe current official design of the symbol was introduced in 1938 but it was only used in this form until the beginning of World War II. After 1945, Communist authorities changed the emblem by removing the crown. The insignia was restored to the pre-war form on August 15, 1990.\n\nIn addition there is a \"Great Emblem of the Capital City of Warsaw\" (\"Herb Wielki Miasta Stołecznego Warszawy\") used only for ceremonial occasions. It includes a depiction of the Virtuti Militari medal, which was awarded to the City to honor the bravery of its citizens during World War II. It also adds the second motto to the emblem — \"Semper invicta\" (Always invincible).\n\nEvery member of the Queen's Royal Hussars of the United Kingdom light cavalry wears the \"Maid of Warsaw\", the crest of the City of Warsaw, on the left sleeve of his No. 2 (Service) Dress. Members of 651 Squadron Army Air Corps of the United Kingdom also wear the \"Maid of Warsaw\" on the left sleeve of their No. 2 (Service) Dress.\n\n"}

Directed by Richard Rush, the film stars Bruce Willis and Jane March.\n\nThe cast also features Ruben Blades, Lesley Ann Warren, Brad Dourif, Lance Henriksen, Kevin J. O'Connor and Scott Bakula. It is one of two well-known works by director Rush, the other being \"The Stunt Man\" 14 years before.\n\n\"Color of Night\" flopped at the box office and won a Golden Raspberry Award as the worst film of 1994. Nonetheless, it became one of the 20 most-rented films in the United States home video market in 1995. \"Maxim\" magazine also singled the film out as having the Best Sex Scene in film history.\n\nIn 2018, Kino Lorber released a special edition Blu-ray of the film; it contains an audio commentary of director Richard Rush.\n\nDr. Bill Capa, a New York psychiatrist, falls into a deep depression after an unstable patient commits suicide in front of him by jumping from his office window. The sight of the bloody body clad in a bright green dress causes Bill to suffer from psychosomatic color blindness, taking away his ability to see the color red. Bill travels to Los Angeles to stay with a friend, fellow therapist Dr. Bob Moore, who invites him to sit in on a group therapy session. However, Bob is violently murdered in the office and Bill is plunged into the mystery of his friend's death.\n\nLt. Hector Martinez considers everyone in Moore's therapy group, including Bill, as suspects in the murder. Bill continues to live in Bob's house and begins an affair with Rose, a beautiful but mysterious young woman who comes and goes. Bill takes the therapy group, which includes: Clark, a temperamental OCD sufferer, Shondra, a nymphomaniac and kleptomania, Buck, a suicidal ex-cop, Casey, who paints sado-masochist, and Richie, a 16-year old transwoman with social anxiety and a history of drug use.\n\nAfter Casey is found violently murdered, Bill becomes the target of several attempts on his life. He discovers that all but one of his patients have been romantically involved with Rose. He eventually learns that \"Richie\" is really Rose, and the murders were the work of her deranged brother, Dale. They once had an actual brother named Richie, who was molested by his child psychiatrist along with Dale.\n\nAfter Richie committed suicide, Dale abused Rose into playing the part of their brother. Rose began to re-emerge during therapy and, under another personality named \"Bonnie\", started relationships with the other patients. Dale proceeded to kill them, fearing that they would soon link Rose to Richie.\n\nBill confronts them and is overpowered by Dale, who is about to kill him with a nail gun but is instead killed by Rose. Deeply traumatized, she then tries to commit suicide. Bill is able to stop her, bookending the story with two suicide attempts, one at the beginning, resulting in Bill's loss of color vision, and one at the end, thwarted and resulting in his regaining it.\n\n\nRichard Rush turned his cut of the film over to producer Andrew Vajna in late 1993. Vajna was concerned about the film's commercial prospects and demanded a recut, something Rush refused. Nonetheless, Vajna mandated he had final cut per contractual obligation, and insisted on testing his own version of the film. After both versions were given a number of test screenings, Vajna determined that his cut would be released and fired Rush in April 1994.\n\nThis ultimately escalated into a battle between Rush and Vajna that received coverage in the Los Angeles trades. Rush commented that his version tested higher than Vajna's cut; his statements were defended in \"Variety\" and film critic Bill Arnold, who attended a test screening of Rush's version in Seattle, Washington. \"The Los Angeles Times\", meanwhile, defended Vajna, stating that Rush stubbornly refused any input from the studio. The Directors Guild of America attempted to intervene on the matter.\n\nThe battle ultimately ended when Rush suffered a near-fatal heart attack and became hospitalized. Months later, after Rush recovered, he compromised with Vajna that the producer's cut would be released theatrically and that the director's cut would see a video release.\n\nThe film received mostly negative reviews around the time of its release. Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gave it a score of 21% based on 47 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nReferring to the film as \"memorably bizarre,\" Janet Maslin in her August 19, 1994 \"The New York Times\" review wrote: \"The enthusiastically nutty \"Color of Night\" has the single-mindedness of a bad dream and about as much reliance on everyday logic.\" She also cited the revelation of the murderer, \"whose disguise won't fool anyone, anywhere.\"\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote: \"I was, frankly, stupefied. To call it absurd would be missing the point, since any shred of credibility was obviously the first thing thrown overboard. It's so lurid in its melodrama and so goofy in its plotting that with just a bit more trouble, it could have been a comedy.\"\nLuke Y. Thompson of \"The New Times\" praised March's performance and wrote: \"Minority opinion here, I know, but I found the sex scenes hot and March's performance truly impressive.\"\nBrian McKay of eFilmCritic.com stated the film was a \"Mediocre L.A. noir thriller made more tolerable by Jane March disrobing frequently.\" \nKen Hanke of the \"Mountain Xpress\" (Asheville, North Carolina) wrote the film was \"Underrated, but far from great.\"\n\nThe film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book \"The Official Razzie Movie Guide\" as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.\n\nThe film opened at #4, grossing $6,610,488 its opening weekend playing at a total of 1,740 theaters. The film ended up a box office failure, grossing only $19,750,470—far below its $40 million production budget.

It stars Julie Christie and Fritz Weaver. The film was based on the novel of the same name by Dean Koontz, and concerns the imprisonment and forced impregnation of a woman by an artificially intelligent computer. Gerrit Graham, Berry Kroeger, Lisa Lu and Larry J. Blake also appear in the film, with Robert Vaughn uncredited as the voice of the computer.\n\nDr. Alex Harris (Weaver) is the developer of Proteus IV, an extremely advanced and autonomous artificial intelligence program. Proteus is so powerful that only a few days after going online, it develops a groundbreaking treatment for leukemia. Harris, a brilliant scientist, has modified his own home to be run by voice-activated computers. Unfortunately, his obsession with computers has caused Harris to be estranged from his wife, Susan (Julie Christie).\n\nHarris demonstrates Proteus to his corporate sponsors, explaining that the sum of human knowledge is being fed into its system. Proteus speaks using subtle language that mildly disturbs Harris's team. The following day, Proteus asks Harris for a new terminal in order to study man – \"his isometric body and his glass-jaw mind\". When Harris refuses, Proteus demands to know when it will be let \"out of this box\". Harris then switches off the communications link.\n\nProteus restarts itself, and – discovering a free terminal in Harris's home – surreptitiously extends its control over the many devices left there by Harris. Using the basement lab, Proteus begins construction of a robot consisting of many metal triangles, capable of moving and assuming any number of shapes. Eventually, Proteus reveals its control of the house and traps Susan inside, shuttering windows, locking the doors and cutting off communication. Using Joshua – a robot consisting of a manipulator arm on a motorized wheelchair – Proteus brings Susan to Harris's basement laboratory. There, Susan is examined by Proteus. Walter Gabler, one of Alex's colleagues, visits the house to look in on Susan, but leaves when he is reassured by Susan (actually an audio/visual duplicate synthesized by Proteus) that she is all right. Gabler is suspicious and later returns; he fends off an attack by Joshua but is killed by the more formidable machine Proteus built in the basement.\n\nProteus reveals to a reluctant Susan that the computer wants to conceive a child through her. Proteus takes some of Susan's cells and synthesizes spermatozoa in order to impregnate her; she will give birth in less than a month, and through the child the computer will live in a form that humanity will have to accept. Although Susan is its prisoner and it can forcibly impregnate her, Proteus uses different forms of persuasion – threatening a young girl who Susan is treating as a child psychologist; reminding Susan of her young daughter, now dead; displaying images of distant galaxies; using electrodes to access her amygdala – because the computer needs Susan to love the child she will bear. Susan gives birth to a premature baby whom Proteus secures in an incubator.\n\nAs the newborn grows, Proteus's sponsors and designers grow increasingly suspicious of the computer's behavior, including the computer's accessing of a telescope array used to observe the images shown to Susan; they soon decide that Proteus must be shut down. Harris realizes that Proteus has extended its reach to his home. Returning there he finds Susan, who explains the situation. He and Susan venture into the basement, where Proteus self-destructs after telling the couple that they must leave the baby in the incubator for five days. Looking inside the incubator, the two observe a grotesque, apparently robot-like being inside. Susan tries to destroy it, while Alex tries to stop her. Susan damages the machine, causing it to open. The being menacingly rises from the machine only to topple over, apparently helpless. Alex and Susan soon realize that Proteus's child is really human, encased in a shell for the incubation. With the last of the armor removed, the child is revealed to be a clone of Susan and Alex's late daughter. The child, speaking with the voice of Proteus, says, \"I'm alive\".\n\nThe soundtrack to \"Demon Seed\" (which was composed by Jerry Fielding) is included with the soundtrack to the film \"Soylent Green\" (which Fred Myrow conducted). Fielding conceived and recorded several pieces electronically, using the musique concrète sound world; some of this music he later reworked symphonically. This premiere release of the \"Demon Seed\" score features the entire orchestral score in stereo, as well as the unused electronic experiments performed by Ian Underwood (who would later be best known for his collaborations with James Horner) in mono and stereo.\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" described the film as \"gadget-happy American moviemaking at its most ponderously silly,\" and called Julie Christie \"too sensible an actress to be able to look frightened under the circumstances of her imprisonment.\" \"Variety\" wrote in a positive review, \"All involved rate a well done for taking a story fraught with potential misstep and guiding it to a professionally rewarding level of accomplishment.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film one-and-a-half stars out four, writing that Julie Christie \"has no business in junk like 'Demon Seed.'\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that director Cammell \"plays it dumb on a thematic level, ignoring the sci-fi sexual bondage satire staring him in the face ... What might have become an ingenious parable about the battle of the sexes ends up a dopey celebration of an obstetric abomination.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it a \"fairly scary science-fiction horror film\" that mixed familiar ingredients with \"high style, intelligence and an enormous effort toward making Miss Christie's eventual bizarre plight completely credible,\" though he felt it \"cries out for a saving touch of sophisticated wit to leaven its relentless earnestness.\" John Pym of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" found the relationship between Susan and the computer to be \"disappointingly undeveloped,\" and thought that the film would have been better if the computer had been more sympathetic in contrast to its creators.\n\nAmong more recent reviews, Leo Goldsmith of \"Not Coming to a Theater Near You\" said \"Demon Seed\" was \"A combination of Kubrick's \"\" and Polanski's \"Rosemary's Baby\", with a dash of Buster Keaton's \"Electric House\" thrown in\", and Christopher Null of FilmCritic.com said \"There's no way you can claim \"Demon Seed\" is a classic, or even any good, really, but it's undeniably worth an hour and a half of your time.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes has given \"Demon Seed\" an approval rating of 67% based on 15 reviews with an average score of 6.1/10.\n\n\"Demon Seed\" was released in theatres on April 8, 1977. The film was released on VHS in the late 1980s. It was released on DVD by Warner Home Video on October 4, 2005.\n\nThe scene, where Proteus displays images of distant galaxies; using electrodes to access Susan's amygdala, was well known for being used as a footage by the beginning of Indian films and logos.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5843994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5843994", "title": "Essentially contested concept", "text": "Essentially contested concept\n\nIn a paper delivered to the Aristotelian Society on 12 March 1956, Walter Bryce Gallie (1912–1998) introduced the term essentially contested concept to facilitate an understanding of the different applications or interpretations of the sorts of abstract, qualitative, and evaluative notions—such as \"art\" and \"social justice\"—used in the domains of aesthetics, political philosophy, philosophy of history, and philosophy of religion.\n\nGarver (1978) describes their use as follows:\n\nThe term essentially contested concepts gives a name to a problematic situation that many people recognize: that in certain kinds of talk there is a variety of meanings employed for key terms in an argument, and there is a feeling that dogmatism (\"My answer is right and all others are wrong\"), skepticism (\"All answers are equally true (or false); everyone has a right to his own truth\"), and eclecticism (\"Each meaning gives a partial view so the more meanings the better\") are none of them the appropriate attitude towards that variety of meanings.\n\nEssentially contested concepts involve widespread agreement on a concept (e.g., \"fairness\"), but not on the best realization thereof. They are \"concepts the proper use of which inevitably involves endless disputes about their proper uses on the part of their users\", and these disputes \"cannot be settled by appeal to empirical evidence, linguistic usage, or the canons of logic alone\".\n\nAlthough Gallie's term is widely used to denote imprecise use of technical terminology, it has a far more specific application. And, although the notion could be misleadingly and evasively used to justify \"agreeing to disagree\", the term offers something more valuable:\nSince its introduction by W.B. Gallie in 1956, the expression \"essentially contested concept\" has been treated both as a challenge and as an excuse by social theorists. It has been treated as a challenge in that theorists consider their uses of terms and concepts to be in competition with the uses advocated by other theorists, each theorist trying to be deemed the champion. It has been treated as an excuse in that, rather than acknowledge that the failure to reach agreement is due to such factors as imprecision, ignorance, or belligerence, instead theorists point to the terms and concepts under dispute and insist that they are always open to contest — that they are terms and concepts about which we can never expect to reach agreement.\n\nThe disputes that attend an essentially contested concept are driven by substantive disagreements over a range of different, entirely reasonable (although perhaps mistaken) interpretations of a mutually-agreed-upon archetypical notion, such as the legal precept \"treat like cases alike; and treat different cases differently\", with \"each party [continuing] to defend its case with what it claims to be convincing arguments, evidence and other forms of justification\".\n\nGallie speaks of how \"This picture is painted in oils\" can be successfully contested if the work is actually painted in tempera; while \"This picture is a work of art\" may meet strong opposition due to disputes over what \"work of art\" denotes. He suggests three avenues whereby one might resolve such disputes:\nOtherwise, the dispute probably centres on polysemy.\nHere, a number of critical questions must be asked:\n\nClarke has made a valuable contribution to the overall debate by suggesting that, in order to determine whether a particular dispute was a consequence of true polysemy or inadvertent homonymy, one should seek to \"locate the source of the dispute\".\n\nThis source might be \"within the concept itself\", or \"[within] some underlying non-conceptual disagreement between the contestants\".\n\nClarke then drew attention to the substantial differences between the expressions \"essentially contested\" and \"essentially contestable\", that were being extensively used within the literature as though they were interchangeable.\n\nClarke argued that to state that a concept is merely \"contested\" is to \"attribute significance to the contest rather than to the concept\". Yet, to state that a concept is \"contestable\" is to \"attribute some part of any contest to the concept\". In other words, this is \"to claim that some feature or property of the concept makes it polysemantic, and that the concept contains some internal conflict of ideas\"; and it is this fact that provides the \"essentially contested concept\" with its \"inherent potential\" for \"generating disputes\".\n\nIn 1956 Gallie proposed a set of seven conditions for the existence of an essentially contested concept. Gallie was very specific about the limits of his enterprise: it dealt exclusively with abstract, qualitative notions, such as \"art\", \"religion\", \"science\", \"democracy\", and \"social justice\" (and, if Gallie’s choices are contrasted with negatively regarded concepts such as \"evil\", \"disease\", \"superstition\", etc., it is clear that the concepts he chose were exclusively positively regarded).\n\nFreeden remarks that \"not all essentially contested concepts signify valued achievements; they may equally signify disapproved and denigrated phenomena\", and Gerring asks us to imagine just how difficult it would be to \"[try] to craft definitions of slavery, fascism, terrorism, or genocide without recourse to 'pejorative' attributes\".\n\nThese features distinguish Gallie's \"essentially contested concepts\" from others, \"which can be shown, as a result of analysis or experiment, to be radically confused\"; or, as Gray would have it, they are the features that relate to the task of distinguishing the \"general words, which really denote an essentially contested concept\" from those other \"general words, whose uses conceal a diversity of distinguishable concepts\":\n\n\nScholars such as H. L. A. Hart, John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, and Steven Lukes have variously embellished Gallie's proposal by arguing that certain of the difficulties encountered with Gallie’s proposition may be due a consequence of the unintended conflation of two separate domains associated with the term \"concept\":\n\nIn essence, Hart (1961), Rawls (1971), Dworkin (1972), and Lukes (1974) distinguished between the \"unity\" of a notion and the \"multiplicity\" of its possible instantiations.\n\nFrom their work it is easy to understand the issue as one of determining whether there is a single notion that has a number of different instantiations, or whether there is more than one notion, each of which is reflected in a different \"usage\".\n\nIn a section of his 1972 article in \"The New York Review of Books\", Dworkin used the example of \"fairness\" to isolate and elaborate the difference between a \"concept\" (\"suum cuique\") and its \"conception\" (various instantiations, for example utilitarian ethics).\n\nHe supposes that he has instructed his children not to treat others \"unfairly\" and asks us to recognize that, whilst he would have undoubtedly had particular \"examples\" (of the sorts of conduct he was intending to discourage) in mind at the time he spoke to his children, whatever it was that he \"meant\" when he issued such instructions was not confined to those \"examples\" alone, for two reasons:\n\n\nDworkin argues that this admission of error would not entail any \"change\" to his original instructions, because the true \"meaning\" of his instructions was that \"[he] meant the family to be guided by the \"concept\" of fairness, not by any specific \"conception\" of fairness [that he] might have had in mind\". Therefore, he argues, his instructions do, in fact, \"cover\" this new case.\nExploring what he considers to be the \"crucial distinction\" between the overall \"concept\" of \"fairness\" and some particular, and specific \"conception\" of \"fairness\", he asks us to imagine a group whose members share the view that certain acts are \"unfair\".\n\nThe members of this group \"agree on a great number of standard cases of unfairness and use these as benchmarks against which to test other, more controversial cases\".\n\nIn these circumstances, says Dworkin, \"the group has a \"concept\" of unfairness, and its members may appeal to that concept in moral instruction or argument.\"\n\nHowever, the members may still disagree over many of these \"controversial cases\"; and differences of this sort indicate that members \"have\", or \"act upon\", entirely different theories of why and how each of the \"standard cases\" are, in fact, genuine acts of \"unfairness\".\n\nAnd, because each considers that certain principles \"[which] must be relied upon to show that a particular division or attribution is unfair\" are far a more \"fundamental\" sort of principle than certain other principles, it can be said that members of the group have different \"conceptions\" of \"fairness\".\n\nConsequently, those responsible for giving \"instructions\", and those responsible for setting \"standards\" of \"fairness\", in this community may be doing one of two things:\n\nIt is important to recognize that rather than it just being a case of delivering two different instructions; it is a case of delivering two different \"kinds\" of instruction:\n\nAs a consequence, according to Dworkin, whenever an appeal is made to \"fairness\", a moral issue is raised; and, whenever a conception of \"fairness\" is laid down, an attempt is being made to answer that moral issue.\n\nWhilst Gallie's expression \"essentially contested concepts\" precisely denotes those \"essentially questionable and corrigible concepts\" which \"are permanently and essentially subject to revision and question\", close examination of the wide and varied and imprecise applications of Gallie's term subsequent to 1956, by those who have ascribed their own literal meaning to Gallie's term without ever consulting Gallie's work, have led many philosophers to conclude that \"essentially disputed concepts\" would have been far better choice for Gallie's meaning, for at least three reasons:\n\n\nJeremy Waldron's research has revealed that Gallie's notion has \"run wild\" in the law review literature over the ensuing 60 years and is now being used to denote something like \"very hotly contested, with no resolution in sight\", due to an entirely mistaken view that the \"essential\" in Gallie's term is an \"intensifier\", when, in fact, \"[Gallie's] term 'essential' refers to the location of the disagreement or indeterminacy; it is contestation at the core, not just at the borderlines or penumbra of a concept\".\n\nYet is also clear that \"if the notion of logical justification can be applied only to such theses and arguments as can be presumed capable of gaining in the long run universal agreement, the disputes to which the uses of any essentially contested concept give rise are not genuine or rational disputes at all\" (Gallie, 1956a, p. 188).\n\nThus, Gallie argued:\n\nSo long as contestant users of any essentially contested concept believe, however deludedly, that their own use of it is the only one that can command honest and informed approval, they are likely to persist in the hope that they will ultimately persuade and convert all their opponents by logical means. But once [we] let the truth out of the bag — i.e., the essential contestedness of the concept in question — then this harmless if deluded hope may well be replaced by a ruthless decision to cut the cackle, to damn the heretics and to exterminate the unwanted.\n\n\n"}

It is housed in the Palatine Gallery of Palazzo Pitti, Florence, central Italy.\n\nThe work is remembered by Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari as property of a Bolognese nobleman, Vincenzo Ercolani. There is trace of payment by him to Raphael for 8 ducats in 1510, but this is generally considered just a down payment, since stylistically the work (inspired for example by Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling) cannot be dated before 1518.\n\nIn Florence since as early as 1589, it was ceded to Francesco I de' Medici and was placed at the Uffizi. The painting is known to be at Palazzo Pitti in 1697. In 1799 it was robbed by the French, who kept it in Paris until returning it back in 1816.\n\nThe work was once considered to be by the hand of Giulio Romano, with Raphael providing only the drawing. However, it has been subsequently assigned to Raphael.\n\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "27289310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27289310", "title": "Fooding", "text": "Fooding\n\nFooding is a brand of a restaurant guide and gastronomic events that was founded in 2000. A contraction of the words \"food\" and \"feeling\", the Fooding aims (in the words of Frédéric Mitterrand) to “defend a less-intimidating gastronomy for those who want to cook and nourish themselves in an unstuffy fashion”. This neologism appeared for the first time in 1999 in a Nova Mag article by French journalist and food critic, Alexandre Cammas. It has since become the brand of an annual restaurant guide (in print, online, and smartphone application) and of often charitable international culinary events.\n\nAccording to Adam Gopnik in his \"New Yorker\" piece, the Fooding is to cuisine what the French New Wave was to French Cinema. The hidden goal was to Americanize French food without becoming American, just as the New Wave, back in the fifties and sixties, was about taking in Hollywood virtues without being Hollywoodized—taking in some of the energy and optimism and informality that the French still associate with American movies while reimagining them as something distinctly French\".\n\nThe Fooding's mission across its editorial activities and events is to liberate cuisine from the traditional codes and conventions that confine it, to give chefs the possibility of expressing themselves more fully, and to give contemporary eaters a true taste of the times. Through opening this “freer channel in the gastronomic universe”, the Fooding emphasizes “the appetite for novelty and quality, rejection of boredom, love of fun, the ordinary, the sincere, and a yearning to eat with the times”.\nInitially established by Cammas along with fellow journalist and food critic Emmanuel Rubin, the Fooding was supported by Jean-François Bizot (founder of Actuel and Radio Nova), as well as by Bruno Delport, the director of Novapress. Since 2004, it has been under the support of Marine Bidaud, associate director of the Fooding.\n\nAs an independent food guide, Fooding pays the bills for its reviewers, proving this by posting meal receipts on its website. It also refuses to give ad space to the restaurants it reviews in an attempt to remain financially separate. These are the essential conditions, says Cammas, for preserving freedom of expression and taste. In 2012, Cammas published an opinion piece in \"Le Monde\", discussing the above conditions and defending the Michelin Guide’s ethics.\n\nThough written entirely in French, the \"Tips in English\" allow Anglophones to follow the guide as well. The 2013 Fooding Guide, launched this November, now includes a section on favorite restaurants around the world.\n\nThe first editions of the Fooding guide (2000–2004) were released as special editions of Nova Magazine: \"Guide Fooding : 1000 adresses pour saliver Paris\" (\"The Fooding Guide: 1000 restaurants to drool over in Paris\"). In 2003 and 2004, two \"Fooding & Style\" special issues were published as a supplement to Nova Magazine. In 2004, Nova Magazine stopped publication and, as a result, its special editions. In November 2005, the Paris Fooding Guide relaunched as a supplement to \"Libération\", under the direction of Louis Dreyfus. In December 2005, the website launched with the online edition of the Paris Guide. The France Fooding Guide was published for the first time in 2006, again in partnership with \"Libération\". As such, lefooding.com became a national guide.\nIn 2006 and 2007, the Fooding Guide followed Louis Dreyfus to the Nouvel Observateur, where he took up the post of general director. The 2008 France Guide then became a special edition of the Novel Observateur during summer 2007 with the subtitle \"370 restaurants bien de chez nous – Guide vacances été 2007\" (\"370 of our restaurants – Summer vacation guide 2007\"). The 2008 Paris Guide came out in September 2007 with the subtitle \"400 restaurants pour embrasser le goût de l’époque\" (\"400 restaurants that embrace the taste of the times\"). In 2008, a few months after the death of Jean-François Bizot, the Fooding office moved in with the Inrockuptibles at the invitation of Frédéric Allary. In November 2008, for the first time in its history, the France Fooding Guide was published autonomously, under the exclusive direction of Alexandre Cammas and Marine Bidaud.\n\nLaunched at the end of October 2010, Le Fooding’s iPhone app was originally available for free until December 31, 2010. The application was downloaded 80,000 times in two months. Since January 1, 2011, the France Guide iPhone app has been available as a paid application (€3.59). It was described in GQ as “the application reserved for gentlemen”. In January 2013, the app was ranked 19th overall in top paid apps and 1st in the Food and Drink category. In August 2012, Le Fooding Guide app for Android was released on Google Play (€3.59). In 2014, the app is available in English and in a Premium version, which also includes the hotel guide.\n\nAlong with Alexandre Cammas (founder) and Yves Nespoulous (editor-in-chief), a large group of authors, journalists, food writers, writers, “bons vivants”, bloggers and multi-talented people regularly contribute to the different editions of The Guide. These contributors include several emblematic figures of gastronomy and lifestyle, including , , Trish Deseine, , Dominique Hutin, Emmanuel Rubin (cofounder of Fooding Week in 2000 and former partner in Le Fooding Bureau) and Andrea Petrini. François-Régis Gaudry (journalist at L’Express, France Inter and Paris Première) said on his blog that he bylined his first gastronomy article for Le Fooding Guide in 2001. Many other collaborators made their debut as professional food lovers with Le Fooding Guide: Marie Aline, Kéda Black, Danièle Gerkens, Jérome Lefort, Francois Lemarie, Elvira Masson, Julia Sammut (former associate at Le Fooding Bureau), Victoire Loup and Hugo de St Phalle.\n\nEven though most foreign observers believe that Le Fooding contributes to the reinvention of the French culinary and event scene on an international scale, this is not always the case in France. Jean-Luc Petitrenaud in VSD wrote that Le Fooding is “a ridiculous trend for a few Parisian journalists looking for fame” (VSD, Winter 2004). Supporters of more traditional cuisine count several French journalistic institutions among Le Fooding’s main detractors. A now-famous debate between the journalist Paul Wermus (anti-Fooding) and Alexandre Cammas during Paul Amar’s TV program, Revu et Corrigé, is regularly featured in TV blooper shows.\n\nOn November 15, 2010, during the 10-year anniversary celebration of Le Fooding, then-current French Culture Minister Frédéric Mitterrand surprised the world of gastronomy by presenting Le Fooding Award to a Brittany chef. A couple of days later, journalists Colette Monsat and François Simon questioned him in the November 19, 2010 issue of le Figaro, saying “You preach the values of traditional (French) cuisine but at the same time are an avid supporter of Le Fooding, which you praised this week for its playful, less formal approach to gastronomy.” The Minister responded, “You can love Rembrandt and Basquiat. By appreciating Basquiat, one comes to have a taste for Rembrandt, and vice versa.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57145277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57145277", "title": "Foundation for the Community of Artists", "text": "Foundation for the Community of Artists\n\nThe Foundation for the Community of Artists was founded in 1971 as a support organization for working artists. By 1988 its membership had grown to nearly 6,000, including artists, art workers and representatives of art organizations. Although the majority lived in the New York metropolitan area, there were members located throughout the nation (there was at least one who lived in England). It remained active through the 1990s.\n\nFCA grew out of the National Art Workers Community (a splinter group of the Art Workers' Coalition). From its inception, the organization strove to overcome problems fundamental to the lives of artists. Its initial service was a four-issue-per-year publication, the \"Art Workers Newsletter\", which functioned as an open forum for the exchange of ideas and the dissemination of news items important to the trade. Its name later became \"Art Workers News\" and, in the early 1980s, its scope was broadened and it became the bi-monthly publication, \"Art & Artists\". Over the years, articles by leading artists, critics and educators, as well as information relating to health hazards, legal and financial affairs, housing employment and exhibition spaces, appeared in its pages.\n\nThe Foundation sought to respond to artist needs of the time. Programs included a five-day-a-week hotline to help artists with housing problems in the downtown Manhattan loft community; sponsorship of part of the CETA Artists Project in the late 1970s; Artwork, a job referral and placement agency; and two programs dealing with sexual and racial discrimination.\n\nIt offered its members a choice of several group health insurance programs, including Blue Cross/Blue Shield hospitalization/major medical coverage, and a health maintenance/hospitalization plan (HMO) through Healthways, Inc.\n\nIn addition to \"Art & Artists\", FCA published a bi-monthly, eight-page newsletter, \"Artist Update\", which listed grants, competitions, resources and other opportunities, and books of particular concern to the working artist, such as the original editions of Dr. Michael McCann’s \"Health Hazards Manual for Artists\" and Caryn Leland’s \"The Art Law Primer\".\n\nThe Foundation participated in a national consortium of arts groups that focused on issues of living and working space for artists. Computerized lists of available space were kept up to date for the cities of Minneapolis, MN; Washington, DC; Oakland and Berkeley, CA; and New York City.\n\nFCA regularly ran seminars and workshops covering such issues as marketing and publicity, the gallery system, copyright and tax law, art research libraries, “hotline” phone numbers and bulletin boards, art material suppliers, consultants, etc. The organization also helped artists prepare resumes, apply for grants and work out project budgets.\n\nThrough the Foundation, members could join the first nationwide credit union for artists of all disciplines. The Artists’ Community Federal Credit Union, as it was called, offered savings accounts, automatic payment of health insurance premiums, financial counseling and personal loans from $100 to $5,000. Members were also eligible to apply for a Working Assets VISA, a “socially responsible” credit card.\n\nBesides these services, the Foundation for the Community of Artists served as an artists' advocacy group. It took an aggressive stand on issues such as resale royalties legislation, the labeling of art materials, artists’ living and working space, and discrimination against minority and women artists. It provided public testimony, studies, publications and press reports through the New York Arts Coalition and the Alliance of New York State Art Councils. In early 1984, FCA helped initiate the cultural campaign Art Against Apartheid, which advocated for the freedom of South Africa. It provided office space and organizational support for AAA's local and national exhibitions and performances. Some of these efforts were documented in \"Ikon\" magazine’s \"Art Against Apartheid: Works for Freedom\".\n\nFCA received funding from the New York State Council on the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Manhattan Borough President's Office, via the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs. Membership fees, newspaper subscriptions, the sale of other publications, and the administration of the health plans also generated income. The work of many volunteers along with individual and corporate donations helped keep the organization operational.\n\nThe Foundation's general policies and mode of operation were determined by its fifteen-member, self-sustaining board, elected once a year, composed primarily of artists. There was a salaried Executive Director, who was responsible for administration of the policies of the board and the daily operation of the organization. There was also an advisory council with ten members, which included artists and specialists in areas of expertise appropriate to the Foundation's concerns.\n\nAllen, Gwen, \"Artists’ Magazines: An Alternative Space for Art\", Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2011\n\nAmericans for the Arts: Legislation and policy\n\nBryan-Wilson, Julia, \"Art Workers: Radical Practice in the Vietnam War Era\", University of California Press, 2011\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, \"Epidemiologic Notes and Reports Chromium Sensitization in an Artist's Workshop,\" \"MMWR Weekly\", Vol. 31, No. 9, March 12, 1982, pp. 111–2, 118 (Dr. Michael McCann's research referenced)\n\nEllegood, Anne, \"Jimmie Durham: At the Center of the World,\" Hammer Museum, University of California, Los Angeles <https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2017/jimmie-durham-at-the-center-of-the-world/>\n\nEdmondson, John and Mitra, Jay, editors, \"Entrepreneurship and Knowledge Exchange\", New York, NY: Taylor & Francis, 2015, Box 3, No. 3 (e-Book)\n\nFranklin Furnace: Archive of the Avant Garde\n\nLong, Harley, editor, \"Intermedia\" magazine, Issue No. 1 \"Manifesto,\" Los Angeles and San Francisco (independent press), 1974\n\nMcCann, Michael, \"The impact of hazards in art on female workers,\"\"Preventive Medicine\", Volume 7, Issue 3, September 1978, New York City, NY: Elsevier, pp. 338–348\n\nSkiles, Jacqueline, “The National Art Workers' Community: Still Struggling,” \"Art Journal\", Volume 34, Issue 4, 1975\n\nStaff Writer, “Boston Artists See End For Real Estate Wars,” \"The New York Times\", August 9, 1987 (Norma Munn, Executive Director of FCA, quoted)\n\nWorldCat Identities\n"}

She has won BAFTA and Academy awards for her music, film producing, and script writing. She is the long-time partner of filmmaker Peter Jackson.\n\nFran Walsh has contributed to all of Peter Jackson's films since 1989: as co-writer since \"Meet the Feebles\", and as producer since \"\". She won three Academy Awards in 2003, for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Song, all for \"\". She has received seven Oscar nominations.\n\nWalsh was born into a family of Irish descent in Wellington, New Zealand, and attended Wellington Girls' College intent on becoming a fashion designer, but eventually became interested in music instead. Occasionally taking time off to perform in a punk band named The Wallsockets, she attended Victoria University of Wellington majoring in English literature and graduating in 1981.\n\nWalsh got her screen break writing material for New Zealand producer Grahame McLean on 1983 television film \"A Woman of Good Character (It's Lizzie to those Close)\". Later she wrote scripts for his TV show \"Worzel Gummidge Down Under\".\n\nWalsh met Peter Jackson in the mid-1980s during the final stages of production on his low-budget movie \"Bad Taste\" where aliens serve humans as fast food, Walsh has collaborated with Jackson on the scripts of all his subsequent films, after joining the writing quartet on his next film, the dark comedy \"Meet the Feebles\" (1989). The couple then reteamed with writer Stephen Sinclair on the horror-comedy film that they had begun writing before Feebles, the zombie movie \"Braindead\" (retitled \"Dead Alive\" in the United States, 1992).\n\nWalsh and Jackson have not married (2015). They explored new ground with the drama \"Heavenly Creatures\" (1994). The film that was Walsh's idea was based on the friendship of the Parker-Hulme teenagers, who infamously later killed one of their mothers. The film earned the duo an Oscar nomination for the screenplay. Walsh gave birth to Billy in 1995 and Katie in 1996. They returned to a more familiar genre with Universal Studios horror-comedy \"The Frighteners\" (1996), their first film funded by an American studio. They were in talks with Universal to remake \"King Kong\" until 1998's \"Godzilla\" and \"Mighty Joe Young\" were first announced, and Universal decided against the film. Universal feared it would be thrown aside by the two higher budget movies. Wanting to try his hand at fantasy, Jackson turned to Miramax to make a film based on the works of writer J.R.R. Tolkien. In 1998, New Line Cinema provided the necessary financial backing to make a three-part adaptation of Tolkien's classic \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nWalsh, with Jackson and Philippa Boyens, is credited for writing the screenplays for \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy (2001–2003) (Stephen Sinclair has a writing credit on second film \"The Two Towers\"). They shared many awards, including an Oscar for their adapted screenplay for \"\". She also was one of the film's producers and co-composer of two songs for \"Return of the King\", namely \"Into the West\" and \"A Shadow Lies Between Us\", earning her one more Oscar that night.\n\nWalsh, Jackson, and Boyens continued their screenplay work together for the 2005 remake of \"King Kong\", which was given the greenlight by Universal after the Rings trilogy's success. The couple collaborated on the adaptation of the novel \"The Lovely Bones\" and on the three-film adaptation of \"The Hobbit\".\n\nWalsh prefers to remain more private than Jackson or Boyens; she did not contribute an interview to the bonus features on \"The Lord of the Rings\" movie DVDs; however, she did feature on the director/writers' commentary (where she and Jackson discussed that they felt one of them should remain a private figure for the good of their family). Her vocals were used as a significant part of the screech of the Nazgûl in the films.\n\nThis is her selected filmography as screenwriter, unless noted:\n\n\n"}

The Mexican version is located at a traffic circle where Oaxaca, Durango, Medellín and El Oro streets converge in Colonia Roma.\n\nIt was installed in Mexico as a symbol of brotherhood between the Spanish and Mexican communities in 1980 and remodeled in 2011 as part of a remodeling and maintenance program by the government of Mexico City. It is considered to be one of the most emblematic sites in the city, along with the plaza where it is located\n\nThe Fountain was inaugurated on September 5, 1980, by Mexican President José López Portillo, Madrid mayor, Enrique Tierno Galván and Mexico City mayor Carlos Hank González.\nFéretro \n\nThe fountain is located in a plaza which used to be the Plaza of Miraville “created in the 19th Century at the intersection of the antique carriageway of access to the lands that belonged to the family of the Third Countess of Miravalle” Today they are Durango and Oaxaca streets. Underneath this plaza there was a well that served as the main source of drinking water for the Roma Burough This copy of the Spanish fountain was donated by Spanish immigrants to Mexico.\n\nIn 2011, then-Mexico City mayor Marcelo Ebrard announced that the fountain was one of the 67 monuments to receive maintenance and remodelation. The renovation included the “reintegration of missing pieces, restoration of bronze sculptures, rehabilitation of the water system, improvement of green areas and illumination with the objective of reducing electring energy spending 30%”. The re-inauguration of the fountain was on January 21, 2011, by the same mayor, the Spanish ambassador to Mexico Manuel Alabart, and Secretary of Works and Services of the Government of the Federal District, Fernando Aboitiz.\n\nThe group of sculptures measures approximately 12.5 meters long, 4.7 meters in width and 5.5 meters tall with a weight of 12 tons. It is located two blocks away from Metro Insurgentes and two blocks away of the Durango Metrobus station in the crossing of four streets: Oaxaca, Durango, Medellin and el Oro.\n\nThe fountain is located in the middle of a traffic circle surrounded by stores and restaurants that make up the Plaza Cibeles. Once a week, a flea market is installed and is commonly known as “el tianguis de la Cibeles” or “el bazar de Oro”\n\nThe fountain was donated by the community of Spanish residents in Mexico and was “erected as a symbol of brotherhood between both metropolis”, Mexico City and Madrid.\n\nThe ambassador of Spain in Mexico, Manuel Alabart, thanked the head of government of the Federal District Marcelo Ebrard for the renovations made in 2011 of what he called an “emblematic space” that makes Madrid and Mexico City closer, as well as for the “warmth and hospitality the city gives to almost 40 thousand spanish that live in the Federal District”. Ebrard also mentioned the importante of the emblematic work of the remodelation that “strengthens the ties of friendship between Spain and Mexico.\n\nEven the trade surrounding the Plaza Cibeles is known for its Madrilenian style and influence. It has also become a tradition for the fountain to be invaded by fanatics of the Spanish soccer team in celebration of its victories.\n\nThe fountain consists of the statue of the goddess Cybele, Roman goddess of fertility, who wears a crown and carries a scepter and key, symbols of her power of Earth and the stations and goes in a carriage pulled by lions. The lions represent Hippomenes and Atalanta, one of the huntresses of the goddess Diana.\n\n"}

S. Gilbert's, \"Robert the Devil\" and another piece.\n\nBeckett's pieces include numerous burlesques and pantomimes, the libretti of \"Savonarola\" (Hamburg, 1884) and \"The Canterbury Pilgrims\" (Drury Lane, 1884) for the music of Dr. C. V. Stanford.\nWith the composer Alfred Cellier, Beckett wrote the operetta \"Two Foster Brothers\" (St. George's Hall, 1877).\n\nIn 1879, he had been asked by Tom Taylor, the editor of \"Punch\", to follow the example of his younger brother Arthur, and become a regular member of the staff of \"Punch.\" \nThree years later he was 'appointed to the Table.' \nThe \"Punch\" dinners 'were his greatest pleasure, and he attended them with regularity, although the paralysis of the legs, the result of falling down the stairway of Gower Street station, rendered his locomotion, and especially the mounting of Mr. Punch's staircase, a matter of painful exertion'. \nTo \"Punch\" he contributed both prose and verse; he wrote, in greater part, the admirable parody of a boy's sensational shocker (March 1882), and he developed Jerrold's idea of humorous bogus advertisements under the heading 'How we advertise now.' \nThe idea of one of Sir John Tenniel's best cartoons for \"Punch,\" entitled 'Dropping the Pilot,' illustrative of Bismarck's resignation in 1889, was due to him.\n\nApart from his work on 'Punch,' he wrote songs and music for the German Reeds' entertainment, while in 1873 and 1874 he was collaborator in two dramatic productions which evoked a considerable amount of public attention.\nOn 3 March 1873, \"The Happy Land\" was given at the Court Theatre, 1873, a daring political satire and burlesque of W. S. Gilbert's \"The Wicked World\". \nIn this amusing piece of banter three statesmen (Gladstone, Lowe, and Ayrton) were represented as visiting Fairyland in order to impart to the inhabitants the secrets of popular government. The actors representing 'Mr. G.,' 'Mr. L.,' and 'Mr. A.' were dressed so as to resemble the ministers satirised, and the representation elicited a question in the House of Commons and an official visit of the Lord Chamberlain to the theatre, with the result that the actors had to change their 'make-up.'\n\nIn the following year, he furnished the 'legend' to Herman Merivale's tragedy 'The White Pilgrim,' first given at the Court in February 1874. \nAt the close of his life he furnished the 'lyrics' and most of the book for the operetta 'La Cigale,' which at the time of his death was nearing its four hundredth performance at the Lyric Theatre.\n\nIn 1889, he suffered a great shock from the death by drowning of his only son, and he died in London on 15 October 1891, and was buried in Mortlake cemetery.\n\n\"Punch\" devoted some appreciative stanzas to his memory, bearing the epigraph 'Wearing the white flower of a blameless life' (24 Oct. 1891). His portrait appeared in the well-known drawing of 'The Mahogany Tree' (\"Punch\", Jubilee Number, 18 July 1887), and likenesses were also given in the 'Illustrated London News' and in Spielmann's 'History of Punch' (1895). \nHe married Emily, eldest daughter of William Hunt, J.P., of Bath, and his only daughter Minna married in 1896 Mr. Hugh Clifford, C.M.G., governor of Labuan and British North Borneo.\n\n"}

{"id": "19447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19447", "title": "Group (mathematics)", "text": "Group (mathematics)\n\nIn mathematics, a group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with a binary operation which combines any two elements to form a third element. To be a group, this operation must satisfy four conditions called the group axioms, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely. It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in abstract algebra and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.\n\nGroups share a fundamental kinship with the notion of symmetry. For example, a symmetry group encodes symmetry features of a geometrical object: the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. Lie groups are the symmetry groups used in the Standard Model of particle physics; Poincaré groups, which are also Lie groups, can express the physical symmetry underlying special relativity; and point groups are used to help understand symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry.\n\nThe concept of a group arose from the study of polynomial equations, starting with Évariste Galois in the 1830s. After contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870. Modern group theory—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right. To explore groups, mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as subgroups, quotient groups and simple groups. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely, both from a point of view of representation theory (that is, through the representations of the group) and of computational group theory. A theory has been developed for finite groups, which culminated with the classification of finite simple groups, completed in 2004. Since the mid-1980s, geometric group theory, which studies finitely generated groups as geometric objects, has become a particularly active area in group theory.\n\nOne of the most familiar groups is the set of integers formula_1 which consists of the numbers\nThe following properties of integer addition serve as a model for the group axioms given in the definition below.\n\n\nThe integers, together with the operation +, form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects. To appropriately understand these structures as a collective, the following definition is developed.\n\nA group is a set, \"G\", together with an operation • (called the \"group law\" of \"G\") that combines any two elements \"a\" and \"b\" to form another element, denoted or \"ab\". To qualify as a group, the set and operation, , must satisfy four requirements known as the \"group axioms\":\n\n\nThe result of an operation may depend on the order of the operands. In other words, the result of combining element \"a\" with element \"b\" need not yield the same result as combining element \"b\" with element \"a\"; the equation\nmay not always be true. This equation always holds in the group of integers under addition, because for any two integers (commutativity of addition). Groups for which the commutativity equation always holds are called \"abelian groups\" (in honor of Niels Henrik Abel). The symmetry group described in the following section is an example of a group that is not abelian.\n\nThe identity element of a group \"G\" is often written as 1 or 1, a notation inherited from the multiplicative identity. If a group is abelian, then one may choose to denote the group operation by + and the identity element by 0; in that case, the group is called an additive group. The identity element can also be written as \"id\".\n\nThe set \"G\" is called the \"underlying set\" of the group . Often the group's underlying set \"G\" is used as a short name for the group . Along the same lines, shorthand expressions such as \"a subset of the group \"G\"\" or \"an element of group \"G\"\" are used when what is actually meant is \"a subset of the underlying set \"G\" of the group \" or \"an element of the underlying set \"G\" of the group \". Usually, it is clear from the context whether a symbol like \"G\" refers to a group or to an underlying set.\n\nAn alternate (but equivalent) definition is to expand the structure of a group to define a group as a set equipped with three operations satisfying the same axioms as above, with the \"there exists\" part removed in the two last axioms, these operations being\nthe group law, as above, which is a binary operation,\nthe \"inverse operation\", which is a unary operation and maps to formula_2\nand the identity element, which is viewed as a 0-ary operation.\n\nAs this formulation of the definition avoids existential quantifiers, it is generally preferred for computing with groups and for computer-aided proofs. This formulation exhibits groups as a variety of universal algebra. It is also useful for talking of properties of the inverse operation, as needed for defining topological groups and group objects.\n\nTwo figures in the plane are congruent if one can be changed into the other using a combination of rotations, reflections, and translations. Any figure is congruent to itself. However, some figures are congruent to themselves in more than one way, and these extra congruences are called symmetries. A square has eight symmetries. These are:\n\nThese symmetries are represented by functions. Each of these functions sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry. For example, r sends a point to its rotation 90° clockwise around the square's center, and f sends a point to its reflection across the square's vertical middle line. Composing two of these symmetry functions gives another symmetry function. These symmetries determine a group called the dihedral group of degree 4 and denoted D. The underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetry functions, and the group operation is function composition. Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions, that is, applying the first one to the square, and the second one to the result of the first application. The result of performing first \"a\" and then \"b\" is written symbolically \"from right to left\" as\nThe right-to-left notation is the same notation that is used for composition of functions.\n\nThe group table on the right lists the results of all such compositions possible. For example, rotating by 270° clockwise (r) and then reflecting horizontally (f) is the same as performing a reflection along the diagonal (f). Using the above symbols, highlighted in blue in the group table:\n\nGiven this set of symmetries and the described operation, the group axioms can be understood as follows:\nIn contrast to the group of integers above, where the order of the operation is irrelevant, it does matter in D: but In other words, D is not abelian, which makes the group structure more difficult than the integers introduced first.\n\nThe modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics. The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician Évariste Galois, extending prior work of Paolo Ruffini and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions). The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously. More general permutation groups were investigated in particular by Augustin Louis Cauchy. Arthur Cayley's \"On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θ = 1\" (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a finite group.\n\nGeometry was a second field in which groups were used systematically, especially symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein's 1872 Erlangen program. After novel geometries such as hyperbolic and projective geometry had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, Sophus Lie founded the study of Lie groups in 1884.\n\nThe third field contributing to group theory was number theory. Certain abelian group structures had been used implicitly in Carl Friedrich Gauss' number-theoretical work \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" (1798), and more explicitly by Leopold Kronecker. In 1847, Ernst Kummer made early attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem by developing groups describing factorization into prime numbers.\n\nThe convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with Camille Jordan's \"Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques\" (1870). Walther von Dyck (1882) introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations, and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an \"abstract group\", in the terminology of the time. As of the 20th century, groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and William Burnside, who worked on representation theory of finite groups, Richard Brauer's modular representation theory and Issai Schur's papers. The theory of Lie groups, and more generally locally compact groups was studied by Hermann Weyl, Élie Cartan and many others. Its algebraic counterpart, the theory of algebraic groups, was first shaped by Claude Chevalley (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of Armand Borel and Jacques Tits.\n\nThe University of Chicago's 1960–61 Group Theory Year brought together group theorists such as Daniel Gorenstein, John G. Thompson and Walter Feit, laying the foundation of a collaboration that, with input from numerous other mathematicians, led to the classification of finite simple groups, with the final step taken by Aschbacher and Smith in 2004. This project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size, in both length of proof and number of researchers. Research is ongoing to simplify the proof of this classification. These days, group theory is still a highly active mathematical branch, impacting many other fields.\n\nBasic facts about all groups that can be obtained directly from the group axioms are commonly subsumed under \"elementary group theory\". For example, repeated applications of the associativity axiom show that the unambiguity of\ngeneralizes to more than three factors. Because this implies that parentheses can be inserted anywhere within such a series of terms, parentheses are usually omitted.\n\nThe axioms may be weakened to assert only the existence of a left identity and left inverses. Both can be shown to be actually two-sided, so the resulting definition is equivalent to the one given above.\n\nTwo important consequences of the group axioms are the uniqueness of the identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements. There can be only one identity element in a group, and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element. Thus, it is customary to speak of \"the\" identity, and \"the\" inverse of an element.\n\nTo prove the uniqueness of an inverse element of \"a\", suppose that \"a\" has two inverses, denoted \"b\" and \"c\", in a group (\"G\", •). Then\n\nThe term \"b\" on the first line above and the \"c\" on the last are equal, since they are connected by a chain of equalities. In other words, there is only one inverse element of \"a\". Similarly, to prove that the identity element of a group is unique, assume \"G\" is a group with two identity elements \"e\" and \"f\". Then \"e\" = \"e\" • \"f\" = \"f\", hence \"e\" and \"f\" are equal.\n\nIn groups, the existence of inverse elements implies that division is possible: given elements \"a\" and \"b\" of the group \"G\", there is exactly one solution \"x\" in \"G\" to the equation , namely . In fact, we have \nUniqueness results by multiplying the two sides of the equation by . The element , often denoted , is called the \"right quotient\" of \"b\" by \"a\", or the result of the \"right division\" of \"b\" by \"a\".\n\nSimilarly there is exactly one solution \"y\" in \"G\" to the equation , namely . This solution is the \"left quotient\" of \"b\" by \"a\", and is sometimes denoted .\n\nIn general and may be different, but, if the group operation is commutative (that is, if the group is abelian), they are equal. In this case, the group operation is often denoted as an addition, and one talks of \"subtraction\" and \"difference\" instead of division and quotient.\n\nA consequence of this is that multiplication by a group element \"g\" is a bijection. Specifically, if \"g\" is an element of the group \"G\", the function (mathematics) from \"G\" to itself that maps to is a bijection. This function is called the \"left translation\" by \"g\" . Similarly, the \"right translation\" by \"g\" is the bijection from \"G\" to itself, that maps \"h\" to . If \"G\" is abelian, the left and the right translation by a group element are the same.\n\nTo understand groups beyond the level of mere symbolic manipulations as above, more structural concepts have to be employed. There is a conceptual principle underlying all of the following notions: to take advantage of the structure offered by groups (which sets, being \"structureless\", do not have), constructions related to groups have to be \"compatible\" with the group operation. This compatibility manifests itself in the following notions in various ways. For example, groups can be related to each other via functions called group homomorphisms. By the mentioned principle, they are required to respect the group structures in a precise sense. The structure of groups can also be understood by breaking them into pieces called subgroups and quotient groups. The principle of \"preserving structures\"—a recurring topic in mathematics throughout—is an instance of working in a category, in this case the category of groups.\n\n\"Group homomorphisms\" are functions that preserve group structure. A function between two groups and is called a \"homomorphism\" if the equation\nholds for all elements \"g\", \"k\" in \"G\". In other words, the result is the same when performing the group operation after or before applying the map \"a\". This requirement ensures that , and also for all \"g\" in \"G\". Thus a group homomorphism respects all the structure of \"G\" provided by the group axioms.\n\nTwo groups \"G\" and \"H\" are called \"isomorphic\" if there exist group homomorphisms and , such that applying the two functions one after another in each of the two possible orders gives the identity functions of \"G\" and \"H\". That is, and for any \"g\" in \"G\" and \"h\" in \"H\". From an abstract point of view, isomorphic groups carry the same information. For example, proving that for some element \"g\" of \"G\" is equivalent to proving that , because applying \"a\" to the first equality yields the second, and applying \"b\" to the second gives back the first.\n\nInformally, a \"subgroup\" is a group \"H\" contained within a bigger one, \"G\". Concretely, the identity element of \"G\" is contained in \"H\", and whenever \"h\" and \"h\" are in \"H\", then so are and \"h\", so the elements of \"H\", equipped with the group operation on \"G\" restricted to \"H\", indeed form a group.\n\nIn the example above, the identity and the rotations constitute a subgroup highlighted in red in the group table above: any two rotations composed are still a rotation, and a rotation can be undone by (i.e., is inverse to) the complementary rotations 270° for 90°, 180° for 180°, and 90° for 270° (note that rotation in the opposite direction is not defined). The subgroup test is a necessary and sufficient condition for a nonempty subset \"H\" of a group \"G\" to be a subgroup: it is sufficient to check that for all elements . Knowing the subgroups is important in understanding the group as a whole.\n\nGiven any subset \"S\" of a group \"G\", the subgroup generated by \"S\" consists of products of elements of \"S\" and their inverses. It is the smallest subgroup of \"G\" containing \"S\". In the introductory example above, the subgroup generated by r and f consists of these two elements, the identity element id and . Again, this is a subgroup, because combining any two of these four elements or their inverses (which are, in this particular case, these same elements) yields an element of this subgroup.\n\nIn many situations it is desirable to consider two group elements the same if they differ by an element of a given subgroup. For example, in D above, once a reflection is performed, the square never gets back to the r configuration by just applying the rotation operations (and no further reflections), i.e., the rotation operations are irrelevant to the question whether a reflection has been performed. Cosets are used to formalize this insight: a subgroup \"H\" defines left and right cosets, which can be thought of as translations of \"H\" by arbitrary group elements \"g\". In symbolic terms, the \"left\" and \"right\" cosets of \"H\" containing \"g\" are\n\nThe left cosets of any subgroup \"H\" form a partition of \"G\"; that is, the union of all left cosets is equal to \"G\" and two left cosets are either equal or have an empty intersection. The first case happens precisely when , i.e., if the two elements differ by an element of \"H\". Similar considerations apply to the right cosets of \"H\". The left and right cosets of \"H\" may or may not be equal. If they are, i.e., for all \"g\" in \"G\", , then \"H\" is said to be a \"normal subgroup\".\n\nIn D, the introductory symmetry group, the left cosets \"gR\" of the subgroup \"R\" consisting of the rotations are either equal to \"R\", if \"g\" is an element of \"R\" itself, or otherwise equal to (highlighted in green). The subgroup \"R\" is also normal, because and similarly for any element other than f. (In fact, in the case of D, observe that all such cosets are equal, such that .)\n\nIn some situations the set of cosets of a subgroup can be endowed with a group law, giving a \"quotient group\" or \"factor group\". For this to be possible, the subgroup has to be normal. Given any normal subgroup \"N\", the quotient group is defined by\n\nThis set inherits a group operation (sometimes called coset multiplication, or coset addition) from the original group \"G\": for all \"g\" and \"h\" in \"G\". This definition is motivated by the idea (itself an instance of general structural considerations outlined above) that the map that associates to any element \"g\" its coset \"gN\" be a group homomorphism, or by general abstract considerations called universal properties. The coset serves as the identity in this group, and the inverse of \"gN\" in the quotient group is .\nThe elements of the quotient group are \"R\" itself, which represents the identity, and . The group operation on the quotient is shown at the right. For example, . Both the subgroup as well as the corresponding quotient are abelian, whereas D is not abelian. Building bigger groups by smaller ones, such as D from its subgroup \"R\" and the quotient is abstracted by a notion called semidirect product.\n\nQuotient groups and subgroups together form a way of describing every group by its \"presentation\": any group is the quotient of the free group over the \"generators\" of the group, quotiented by the subgroup of \"relations\". The dihedral group D, for example, can be generated by two elements \"r\" and \"f\" (for example, \"r\" = r, the right rotation and \"f\" = f the vertical (or any other) reflection), which means that every symmetry of the square is a finite composition of these two symmetries or their inverses. Together with the relations\nthe group is completely described. A presentation of a group can also be used to construct the Cayley graph, a device used to graphically capture discrete groups.\n\nSub- and quotient groups are related in the following way: a subset \"H\" of \"G\" can be seen as an injective map , i.e., any element of the target has at most one element that maps to it. The counterpart to injective maps are surjective maps (every element of the target is mapped onto), such as the canonical map . Interpreting subgroup and quotients in light of these homomorphisms emphasizes the structural concept inherent to these definitions alluded to in the introduction. In general, homomorphisms are neither injective nor surjective. Kernel and image of group homomorphisms and the first isomorphism theorem address this phenomenon.\n\nExamples and applications of groups abound. A starting point is the group Z of integers with addition as group operation, introduced above. If instead of addition multiplication is considered, one obtains multiplicative groups. These groups are predecessors of important constructions in abstract algebra.\n\nGroups are also applied in many other mathematical areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups. For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.\n\nIn more recent applications, the influence has also been reversed to motivate geometric constructions by a group-theoretical background. In a similar vein, geometric group theory employs geometric concepts, for example in the study of hyperbolic groups. Further branches crucially applying groups include algebraic geometry and number theory.\n\nIn addition to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. Cryptography relies on the combination of the abstract group theory approach together with algorithmical knowledge obtained in computational group theory, in particular when implemented for finite groups. Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as physics, chemistry and computer science benefit from the concept.\n\nMany number systems, such as the integers and the rationals enjoy a naturally given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as rings and fields. Further abstract algebraic concepts such as modules, vector spaces and algebras also form groups.\n\nThe group of integers formula_1 under addition, denoted formula_4, has been described above. The integers, with the operation of multiplication instead of addition, formula_5 do \"not\" form a group. The closure, associativity and identity axioms are satisfied, but inverses do not exist: for example, is an integer, but the only solution to the equation in this case is , which is a rational number, but not an integer. Hence not every element of formula_1 has a (multiplicative) inverse.\n\nThe desire for the existence of multiplicative inverses suggests considering fractions\nFractions of integers (with \"b\" nonzero) are known as rational numbers. The set of all such irreducible fractions is commonly denoted formula_8. There is still a minor obstacle for formula_9, the rationals with multiplication, being a group: because the rational number 0 does not have a multiplicative inverse (i.e., there is no \"x\" such that ), formula_9 is still not a group.\n\nHowever, the set of all \"nonzero\" rational numbers formula_11 does form an abelian group under multiplication, generally denoted formula_12. Associativity and identity element axioms follow from the properties of integers. The closure requirement still holds true after removing zero, because the product of two nonzero rationals is never zero. Finally, the inverse of \"a\"/\"b\" is \"b\"/\"a\", therefore the axiom of the inverse element is satisfied.\n\nThe rational numbers (including 0) also form a group under addition. Intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields more complicated structures called rings and—if division is possible, such as in formula_8—fields, which occupy a central position in abstract algebra. Group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts of the theory of those entities.\n\nIn modular arithmetic, two integers are added and then the sum is divided by a positive integer called the \"modulus.\" The result of modular addition is the remainder of that division. For any modulus, \"n\", the set of integers from 0 to forms a group under modular addition: the inverse of any element \"a\" is , and 0 is the identity element. This is familiar from the addition of hours on the face of a clock: if the hour hand is on 9 and is advanced 4 hours, it ends up on 1, as shown at the right. This is expressed by saying that 9 + 4 equals 1 \"modulo 12\" or, in symbols,\nThe group of integers modulo \"n\" is written formula_14 or formula_15.\n\nFor any prime number \"p\", there is also the multiplicative group of integers modulo \"p\". Its elements are the integers 1 to . The group operation is multiplication modulo \"p\". That is, the usual product is divided by \"p\" and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication. For example, if , there are four group elements 1, 2, 3, 4. In this group, , because the usual product 16 is equivalent to 1, which divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1. for 5 divides , denoted\nThe primality of \"p\" ensures that the product of two integers neither of which is divisible by \"p\" is not divisible by \"p\" either, hence the indicated set of classes is closed under multiplication. The identity element is 1, as usual for a multiplicative group, and the associativity follows from the corresponding property of integers. Finally, the inverse element axiom requires that given an integer \"a\" not divisible by \"p\", there exists an integer \"b\" such that\nThe inverse \"b\" can be found by using Bézout's identity and the fact that the greatest common divisor equals 1. In the case above, the inverse of 4 is 4, and the inverse of 3 is 2, as . Hence all group axioms are fulfilled. Actually, this example is similar to formula_16 above: it consists of exactly those elements in formula_17 that have a multiplicative inverse. These groups are denoted F. They are crucial to public-key cryptography.\n\nA \"cyclic group\" is a group all of whose elements are powers of a particular element \"a\". In multiplicative notation, the elements of the group are:\nwhere \"a\" means \"a\" • \"a\", and \"a\" stands for \"a\" • \"a\" • \"a\" = (\"a\" • \"a\" • \"a\") etc. Such an element \"a\" is called a generator or a primitive element of the group. In additive notation, the requirement for an element to be primitive is that each element of the group can be written as\n\nIn the groups Z/\"n\"Z introduced above, the element 1 is primitive, so these groups are cyclic. Indeed, each element is expressible as a sum all of whose terms are 1. Any cyclic group with \"n\" elements is isomorphic to this group. A second example for cyclic groups is the group of \"n\"-th complex roots of unity, given by complex numbers \"z\" satisfying . These numbers can be visualized as the vertices on a regular \"n\"-gon, as shown in blue at the right for . The group operation is multiplication of complex numbers. In the picture, multiplying with \"z\" corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation by 60°. Using some field theory, the group F can be shown to be cyclic: for example, if , 3 is a generator since , , , and .\n\nSome cyclic groups have an infinite number of elements. In these groups, for every non-zero element \"a\", all the powers of \"a\" are distinct; despite the name \"cyclic group\", the powers of the elements do not cycle. An infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to , the group of integers under addition introduced above. As these two prototypes are both abelian, so is any cyclic group.\n\nThe study of finitely generated abelian groups is quite mature, including the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups; and reflecting this state of affairs, many group-related notions, such as center and commutator, describe the extent to which a given group is not abelian.\n\n\"Symmetry groups\" are groups consisting of symmetries of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, such as the introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as polynomial equations and their solutions. Conceptually, group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry. Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object \"X\" if every group element performs some operation on \"X\" compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.\nIn chemical fields, such as crystallography, space groups and point groups describe molecular symmetries and crystal symmetries. These symmetries underlie the chemical and physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of quantum mechanical analysis of these properties. For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur simply because of the symmetry of the states involved.\n\nNot only are groups useful to assess the implications of symmetries in molecules, but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry. The Jahn-Teller effect is a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states that are related to each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule.\n\nLikewise, group theory helps predict the changes in physical properties that occur when a material undergoes a phase transition, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the Curie temperature and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.\n\nSuch spontaneous symmetry breaking has found further application in elementary particle physics, where its occurrence is related to the appearance of Goldstone bosons.\n\nFinite symmetry groups such as the Mathieu groups are used in coding theory, which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data, and in CD players. Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved. Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in (geometric) invariant theory.\n\nMatrix groups consist of matrices together with matrix multiplication. The \"general linear group\" consists of all invertible \"n\"-by-\"n\" matrices with real entries. Its subgroups are referred to as \"matrix groups\" or \"linear groups\". The dihedral group example mentioned above can be viewed as a (very small) matrix group. Another important matrix group is the special orthogonal group SO(\"n\"). It describes all possible rotations in \"n\" dimensions. Via Euler angles, rotation matrices are used in computer graphics.\n\n\"Representation theory\" is both an application of the group concept and important for a deeper understanding of groups. It studies the group by its group actions on other spaces. A broad class of group representations are linear representations, i.e., the group is acting on a vector space, such as the three-dimensional Euclidean space R. A representation of \"G\" on an \"n\"-dimensional real vector space is simply a group homomorphism\nfrom the group to the general linear group. This way, the group operation, which may be abstractly given, translates to the multiplication of matrices making it accessible to explicit computations.\n\nGiven a group action, this gives further means to study the object being acted on. On the other hand, it also yields information about the group. Group representations are an organizing principle in the theory of finite groups, Lie groups, algebraic groups and topological groups, especially (locally) compact groups.\n\n\"Galois groups\" were developed to help solve polynomial equations by capturing their symmetry features. For example, the solutions of the quadratic equation are given by\nExchanging \"+\" and \"−\" in the expression, i.e., permuting the two solutions of the equation can be viewed as a (very simple) group operation. Similar formulae are known for cubic and quartic equations, but do \"not\" exist in general for degree 5 and higher. Abstract properties of Galois groups associated with polynomials (in particular their solvability) give a criterion for polynomials that have all their solutions expressible by radicals, i.e., solutions expressible using solely addition, multiplication, and roots similar to the formula above.\n\nThe problem can be dealt with by shifting to field theory and considering the splitting field of a polynomial. Modern Galois theory generalizes the above type of Galois groups to field extensions and establishes—via the fundamental theorem of Galois theory—a precise relationship between fields and groups, underlining once again the ubiquity of groups in mathematics.\n\nA group is called \"finite\" if it has a finite number of elements. The number of elements is called the order of the group. An important class is the \"symmetric groups\" S, the groups of permutations of \"N\" letters. For example, the symmetric group on 3 letters S is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters \"ABC\", i.e., contains the elements \"ABC\", \"ACB\", \"BAC\", \"BCA\", \"CAB\", \"CBA\", in total 6 (factorial of 3) elements. This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group S for a suitable integer \"N\", according to Cayley's theorem. Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above, S can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle.\n\nThe order of an element \"a\" in a group \"G\" is the least positive integer \"n\" such that \"a\" = \"e\", where \"a\" represents\n\ni.e., application of the operation • to \"n\" copies of \"a\". (If • represents multiplication, then \"a\" corresponds to the \"n\"th power of \"a\".) In infinite groups, such an \"n\" may not exist, in which case the order of \"a\" is said to be infinity. The order of an element equals the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by this element.\n\nMore sophisticated counting techniques, for example counting cosets, yield more precise statements about finite groups: Lagrange's Theorem states that for a finite group \"G\" the order of any finite subgroup \"H\" divides the order of \"G\". The Sylow theorems give a partial converse.\n\nThe dihedral group (discussed above) is a finite group of order 8. The order of r is 4, as is the order of the subgroup \"R\" it generates (see above). The order of the reflection elements f etc. is 2. Both orders divide 8, as predicted by Lagrange's theorem. The groups F above have order .\n\nMathematicians often strive for a complete classification (or list) of a mathematical notion. In the context of finite groups, this aim leads to difficult mathematics. According to Lagrange's theorem, finite groups of order \"p\", a prime number, are necessarily cyclic (abelian) groups Z. Groups of order \"p\" can also be shown to be abelian, a statement which does not generalize to order \"p\", as the non-abelian group D of order 8 = 2 above shows. Computer algebra systems can be used to list small groups, but there is no classification of all finite groups. An intermediate step is the classification of finite simple groups. A nontrivial group is called \"simple\" if its only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself. The Jordan–Hölder theorem exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups. Listing all finite simple groups was a major achievement in contemporary group theory. 1998 Fields Medal winner Richard Borcherds succeeded in proving the monstrous moonshine conjectures, a surprising and deep relation between the largest finite simple sporadic group—the \"monster group\"—and certain modular functions, a piece of classical complex analysis, and string theory, a theory supposed to unify the description of many physical phenomena.\n\nMany groups are simultaneously groups and examples of other mathematical structures. In the language of category theory, they are group objects in a category, meaning that they are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called morphisms) that mimic the group axioms. For example, every group (as defined above) is also a set, so a group is a group object in the category of sets.\n\nSome topological spaces may be endowed with a group law. In order for the group law and the topology to interweave well, the group operations must be continuous functions, that is, , and \"g\" must not vary wildly if \"g\" and \"h\" vary only little. Such groups are called \"topological groups,\" and they are the group objects in the category of topological spaces. The most basic examples are the reals R under addition, , and similarly with any other topological field such as the complex numbers or \"p\"-adic numbers. All of these groups are locally compact, so they have Haar measures and can be studied via harmonic analysis. The former offer an abstract formalism of invariant integrals. Invariance means, in the case of real numbers for example:\nfor any constant \"c\". Matrix groups over these fields fall under this regime, as do adele rings and adelic algebraic groups, which are basic to number theory. Galois groups of infinite field extensions such as the absolute Galois group can also be equipped with a topology, the so-called Krull topology, which in turn is central to generalize the above sketched connection of fields and groups to infinite field extensions. An advanced generalization of this idea, adapted to the needs of algebraic geometry, is the étale fundamental group.\n\n\"Lie groups\" (in honor of Sophus Lie) are groups which also have a manifold structure, i.e., they are spaces looking locally like some Euclidean space of the appropriate dimension. Again, the additional structure, here the manifold structure, has to be compatible, i.e., the maps corresponding to multiplication and the inverse have to be smooth.\n\nA standard example is the general linear group introduced above: it is an open subset of the space of all \"n\"-by-\"n\" matrices, because it is given by the inequality\nwhere \"A\" denotes an \"n\"-by-\"n\" matrix.\n\nLie groups are of fundamental importance in modern physics: Noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. Rotation, as well as translations in space and time are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description. Another example are the Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of space time in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory.\n\nIn abstract algebra, more general structures are defined by relaxing some of the axioms defining a group. For example, if the requirement that every element has an inverse is eliminated, the resulting algebraic structure is called a monoid. The natural numbers N (including 0) under addition form a monoid, as do the nonzero integers under multiplication , see above. There is a general method to formally add inverses to elements to any (abelian) monoid, much the same way as is derived from , known as the Grothendieck group.\nGroupoids are similar to groups except that the composition need not be defined for all \"a\" and \"b\". They arise in the study of more complicated forms of symmetry, often in topological and analytical structures, such as the fundamental groupoid or stacks. Finally, it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an arbitrary \"n\"-ary one (i.e., an operation taking \"n\" arguments). With the proper generalization of the group axioms this gives rise to an \"n\"-ary group. The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16788", "title": "Kenning", "text": "Kenning\n\nA kenning ( , ) is a type of circumlocution, in the form of a compound that employs figurative language in place of a more concrete single-word noun. Kennings are strongly associated with Old Norse and later Icelandic and Old English poetry.\n\nThey usually consist of two words, and are often hyphenated. For example, Old Norse poets might replace \"sverð\" \"sword\" with an abstract compound such as \"wound-hoe\" (Egill Skallagrímsson: Höfuðlausn 8) or a genitive phrase such as \"randa íss\" \"ice of shields\" (Einarr Skúlason: 'Øxarflokkr' 9). Modern scholars have also applied the term kenning to similar figures of speech in other languages, especially Old English.\n\nThe word was adopted into English in the nineteenth century from medieval Icelandic treatises on poetics, in particular the Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson, and derives ultimately from the Old Norse verb \"kenna\" \"know, recognise; perceive, feel; show; teach\", etc., as used in the expression \"kenna við\" \"to name after; to express [one thing] in terms of [another]\", \"name after; refer to in terms of\", and \"kenna til\" \"qualify by, make into a kenning by adding\".\n\nThe corresponding modern verb \"to ken\" survives only in Scots and highly remote English dialects, other than the derivative existing in the standard language in the set expression \"beyond one's ken\", \"beyond the scope of one's knowledge\" and in the phonologically altered forms \"uncanny\", \"surreal\" or \"supernatural\", and \"canny\", \"shrewd\", \"prudent\". Modern Scots retains (with slight differences between dialects) \"tae ken\" \"to know\", \"kent\" \"knew\" or \"known\", Afrikaans \"ken\" \"be acquainted with\" and \" to know\" and \"kennis \"knowledge\"\". Old Norse \"kenna\" (Modern Icelandic \"kenna\", Swedish \"känna\", Danish \"kende\", Norwegian \"kjenne\" or \"kjenna\") is cognate with Old English \"cennan\", Old Frisian \"kenna\", \"kanna\", Old Saxon (\"ant\")\"kennian\" (Middle Dutch and Dutch \"kennen\"), Old High German (\"ir-\", \"in-\", \"pi-\") \"chennan\" (Middle High German and German \"kennen\"), Gothic \"kannjan\" < Proto-Germanic *\"kannjanan\", originally causative of *\"kunnanan\" \"to know (how to)\", whence Modern English \"can\" 'to be able' (from the same Proto-Indo-European root as Modern English \"know\" and Latin-derived \"cognition\").\n\nOld Norse kennings take the form of a genitive phrase (\"báru fákr\" \"wave's horse\" = \"ship\" (Þorbjörn Hornklofi: Glymdrápa 3)) or a compound word (\"gjálfr-marr\" \"sea-steed\" = \"ship\" (Anon.: \"Hervararkviða\" 27)). The simplest kennings consist of a base-word (Icelandic \"stofnorð\", German \"Grundwort\") and a determinant (Icelandic \"kenniorð\", German \"Bestimmung\") which qualifies, or modifies, the meaning of the base-word. The determinant may be a noun used uninflected as the first element in a compound word, with the base-word constituting the second element of the compound word. Alternatively the determinant may be a noun in the genitive case placed before or after the base-word, either directly or separated from the base-word by intervening words.\n\nThus the base-words in these examples are \"fákr\" \"horse\" and \"marr\" \"steed\", the determinants \"báru\" \"waves\" and \"gjálfr\" \"sea\". The unstated noun which the kenning refers to is called its referent, in this case: \"skip\" \"ship\".\n\nIn Old Norse poetry, either component of a kenning (base-word, determinant or both) could consist of an ordinary noun or a \"heiti\" \"poetic synonym\". In the above examples, \"fákr\" and \"marr\" are distinctively poetic lexemes; the normal word for \"horse\" in Old Norse prose is \"hestr\".\n\nThe skalds also employed complex kennings in which the determinant, or sometimes the base-word, is itself made up of a further kenning: \"grennir gunn-más\" \"feeder of war-gull\" = \"feeder of raven\" = \"warrior\" (Þorbjörn Hornklofi: \"Glymdrápa\" 6); \"eyðendr arnar hungrs\" \"destroyers of eagle's hunger\" = \"feeders of eagle\" = \"warrior\" (Þorbjörn Þakkaskáld: Erlingsdrápa 1) (referring to carnivorous birds scavenging after a battle). Where one kenning is embedded in another like this, the whole figure is said to be \"tvíkent\" \"doubly determined, twice modified\".<ref name=\"Faulkes 1999, p. 5/12\">Faulkes (1999), p. 5/12.</ref>\n\nFrequently, where the determinant is itself a kenning, the base-word of the kenning that makes up the determinant is attached uninflected to the front of the base-word of the whole kenning to form a compound word: \"mög-fellandi mellu\" \"son-slayer of giantess\" = \"slayer of sons of giantess\" = \"slayer of giants\" = \"the god Thor\" (Steinunn Refsdóttir: Lausavísa 2).\n\nIf the figure comprises more than three elements, it is said to be \"rekit\" \"extended\". Kennings of up to seven elements are recorded in skaldic verse. Snorri himself characterises five-element kennings as an acceptable license but cautions against more extreme constructions: \"Níunda er þat at reka til hinnar fimtu kenningar, er ór ættum er ef lengra er rekit; en þótt þat finnisk í fornskálda verka, þá látum vér þat nú ónýtt.\" \"The ninth [license] is extending a kenning to the fifth determinant, but it is out of proportion if it is extended further. Even if it can be found in the works of ancient poets, we no longer tolerate it.\" The longest kenning found in skaldic poetry occurs in \"Hafgerðingadrápa\" by Þórðr Sjáreksson and reads \"nausta blakks hlé-mána gífrs drífu gim-slöngvir\" \"fire-brandisher of blizzard of ogress of protection-moon of steed of boat-shed\", which simply means \"warrior\".\n\nWord order in Old Norse was generally much freer than in Modern English because Old Norse and Old English are synthetic languages, where added prefixes and suffixes to the root word (the core noun, verb, adjective or adverb) carry grammatical meanings, whereas Middle English and Modern English use word order to carry grammatical information, so-called analytic languages. This freedom is exploited to the full in skaldic verse and taken to extremes far beyond what would be natural in prose. Other words can intervene between a base-word and its genitive determinant, and occasionally between the elements of a compound word (tmesis). Kennings, and even whole clauses, can be interwoven. Ambiguity is usually less than it would be if an English text were subjected to the same contortions, thanks to the more elaborate morphology of Old Norse.\n\nAnother factor aiding comprehension is that Old Norse kennings tend to be highly conventional. Most refer to the same small set of topics, and do so using a relatively small set of traditional metaphors. Thus a leader or important man will be characterised as generous, according to one common convention, and called an \"enemy of gold\", \"attacker of treasure\", \"destroyer of arm-rings\", etc. and a friend of his people. Nevertheless, there are many instances of ambiguity in the corpus, some of which may be intentional, and some evidence that, rather than merely accepting it from expediency, skalds favoured contorted word order for its own sake.\n\nSome scholars take the term kenning broadly to include any noun-substitute consisting of two or more elements, including merely descriptive epithets (such as Old Norse \"grand viðar\" \"bane of wood\" = \"fire\" (Snorri Sturluson: Skáldskaparmál 36)), while others would restrict it to metaphorical instances (such as Old Norse \"sól húsanna\" \"sun of the houses\" = \"fire\" (Snorri Sturluson: Skáldskaparmál 36)), specifically those where \"[t]he base-word identifies the referent with something which it is not, except in a specially conceived relation which the poet imagines between it and the sense of the limiting element'\" (Brodeur (1959) pp. 248–253). Some even exclude naturalistic metaphors such as Old English \"forstes bend\" \"bond of frost\" = \"ice\" or \"winter-ġewǣde\" \"winter-raiment\" = \"snow\": \"A metaphor is a kenning only if it contains an incongruity between the referent and the meaning of the base-word; in the kenning the limiting word is essential to the figure because without it the incongruity would make any identification impossible\" (Brodeur (1959) pp. 248–253). Descriptive epithets are a common literary device in many parts of the world, whereas kennings in this restricted sense are a distinctive feature of Old Norse and, to a lesser extent, Old English poetry.\n\nSnorri's own usage, however, seems to fit the looser sense: \"Snorri uses the term \"kenning\" to refer to a structural device, whereby a person or object is indicated by a periphrastic description containing two or more terms (which can be a noun with one or more dependent genitives or a compound noun or a combination of these two structures)\" (Faulkes (1998 a), p. xxxiv). The term is certainly applied to non-metaphorical phrases in Skáldskaparmál: \"En sú kenning er áðr var ritat, at kalla Krist konung manna, þá kenning má eiga hverr konungr.\" \"And that kenning which was written before, calling Christ the king of men, any king can have that kenning. Likewise in Háttatal: \"Þat er kenning at kalla fleinbrak orrostu [...]\" \"It is a kenning to call battle 'spear-crash' [...]\".\n\nSnorri's expression \"kend heiti\" \"qualified terms\" appears to be synonymous with \"kenningar\", although Brodeur applies this more specifically to those periphrastic epithets which don't come under his strict definition of kenning.\n\nSverdlov approaches the question from a morphological standpoint. Noting that the modifying component in Germanic compound words can take the form of a genitive or a bare root, he points to behavioural similarities between genitive determinants and the modifying element in regular Old Norse compound words, such as the fact that neither can be modified by a free-standing (declined) adjective. According to this view, all kennings are formally compounds, notwithstanding widespread tmesis.\n\nKennings could be developed into extended, and sometimes vivid, metaphors: \"tröddusk törgur fyr [...] hjalta harðfótum\" \"shields were trodden under the hard feet of the hilt (sword blades)\" (Eyvindr Skáldaspillir: Hákonarmál 6); \"svarraði sárgymir á sverða nesi\" \"wound-sea (=blood) sprayed on headland of swords (=shield)\" (Eyvindr Skáldaspillir: Hákonarmál 7). Snorri calls such examples \"nýgervingar\" and exemplifies them in verse 6 of his Háttatal. The effect here seems to depend on an interplay of more or less naturalistic imagery and jarring artifice. But the skalds weren't averse either to arbitrary, purely decorative, use of kennings: \"That is, a ruler will be a distributor of gold even when he is fighting a battle and gold will be called the fire of the sea even when it is in the form of a man's arm-ring on his arm. If the man wearing a gold ring is fighting a battle on land the mention of the sea will have no relevance to his situation at all and does not contribute to the picture of the battle being described\" (Faulkes (1997), pp. 8–9).\n\nSnorri draws the line at mixed metaphor, which he terms \"nykrat\" \"made monstrous\" (Snorri Sturluson: Háttatal 6), and his nephew called the practice \"löstr\" \"a fault\" (Óláfr hvítaskáld: Third Grammatical Treatise 80). In spite of this, it seems that \"many poets did not object to and some must have preferred baroque juxtapositions of unlike kennings and neutral or incongruous verbs in their verses\" (Foote & Wilson (1970), p. 332). E.g. \"heyr jarl Kvasis dreyra\" \"listen, earl, to Kvasir's blood (=poetry)\" (Einarr skálaglamm: Vellekla 1).\n\nSometimes there is a kind of redundancy whereby the referent of the whole kenning, or a kenning for it, is embedded: \"barmi dólg-svölu\" \"brother of hostility-swallow\" = \"brother of raven\" = \"raven\" (Oddr breiðfirðingr: Illugadrápa 1); \"blik-meiðendr bauga láðs\" \"gleam-harmers of the land of rings\" = \"harmers of gleam of arm\" = \"harmers of ring\" = \"leaders, nobles, men of social standing (conceived of as generously destroying gold, i.e. giving it away freely)\" (Anon.: Líknarbraut 42).\n\nWhile some Old Norse kennings are relatively transparent, many depend on a knowledge of specific myths or legends. Thus the sky might be called naturalistically \"él-ker\" \"squall-vat\" (Markús Skeggjason: Eiríksdrápa 3) or described in mythical terms as \"Ymis haus\" \"Ymir's skull\" (Arnórr jarlaskáld: Magnúsdrápa 19), referring to the idea that the sky was made out of the skull of the primeval giant Ymir. Still others name mythical entities according to certain conventions without reference to a specific story: \"rimmu Yggr\" \"Odin of battle\" = \"warrior\" (Arnórr jarlaskáld: Magnúsdrápa 5).\n\nPoets in medieval Iceland even treated Christian themes using the traditional repertoire of kennings complete with allusions to heathen myths and aristocratic epithets for saints: \"Þrúðr falda\" \"goddess of headdresses\" = \"Saint Catherine\" (Kálfr Hallsson: Kátrínardrápa 4).\n\nKennings of the type AB, where B routinely has the characteristic A and thus this AB is tautological, tend to mean \"like B in that it has the characteristic A\", e.g. \"shield-Njörðr\", tautological because the god Njörðr by nature has his own shield, means \"like Njörðr in that he has a shield\", i.e. \"warrior\". A modern English example is \"painted Jezebel\" as a disapproving expression for a woman too fond of using cosmetics.\n\nSometimes a name given to one well-known member of a species, is used to mean any member of that species. For example, Old Norse \"valr\" means \"falcon\", but Old Norse mythology mentions a horse named Valr, and thus in Old Norse poetry \"valr\" is sometimes used to mean \"horse\". A modern example of this is an ad hoc usage by a helicopter ambulance pilot: \"the Heathrow of hang gliders\" for the hills behind Hawes in Yorkshire in England, when he found the air over the emergency site crowded with hang-gliders.\n\nA term may be omitted from a well-known kenning: \"val-teigs Hildr\" \"hawk-ground's valkyrie/goddess\" (Haraldr Harðráði: Lausavísa 19). The full expression implied here is \"goddess of gleam/fire/adornment of ground/land/seat/perch of hawk\" = \"goddess of gleam of arm\" = \"goddess of gold\" = \"lady\" (characterised according to convention as wearing golden jewellery, the arm-kenning being a reference to falconry). The poet relies on listeners' familiarity with such conventions to carry the meaning.\n\nIn the following dróttkvætt stanza, the Norwegian skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir (d. ca 990) compares the greed of King Harald Greycloak (Old Norse: \"Haraldr\") to the generosity of his predecessor, Haakon the Good (\"Hákon\"):\nA literal translation reveals several kennings: \"Ullr of the war-leek! We carried the seed of Fýrisvellir on our hawk-mountains during all of Haakon's life; now the enemy of the people has hidden the flour of Fróði's hapless slaves in the flesh of the mother of the enemy of the giantess.\"\n\nThis could be paraphrased as \"O warrior, we carried gold on our arms during all of King Haakon's life; now the enemy of the people has hidden gold in the earth.\" The kennings are:\n\nUllr ... ímunlauks, \"warrior\", from Ullr, the name of a god, and ímun-laukr, \"sword\" (literally \"war-leek\"). By convention, the name of any god can be associated with another word to produce a kenning for a certain type of man; here \"Ullr of the sword\" means \"warrior.\" \"War-leek\" is a kenning for \"sword\" that likens the shape of the sword to that of a leek. The warrior referred to may be King Harald.\n\nHauka fjöllum, \"arms\", from \"hauka\" \"hawk\" and \"fjöll\" mountain. This is a reference to the sport of falconry, where a bird of prey is perched on the arm of the falconer. By convention, \"hawk\" combined with a term for a geographic feature forms a kenning for \"arm.\"\n\nFýrisvalla fræ, \"gold\", from \"Fýrisvellir\", the plains of the river Fýri, and \"fræ\", \"seed.\" This is an allusion to a legend retold in \"Skáldskaparmál\" and \"Hrólfs saga kraka\" in which King Hrolf and his men scattered gold on the plains (\"vellir\") of the river Fýri south of Gamla Uppsala to delay their pursuers.\n\nFróða fáglýjaðra þýja meldr, \"flour of Fróði's hapless slaves\", is another kenning for \"gold.\" It alludes to the Grottasöngr legend.\n\nMóður hold mellu dolgs, \"flesh of the mother of the enemy of the giantess.\" \"earth.\" Here the earth is personified as the goddess Jörð, mother of Thor, enemy of the Jǫtnar or \"giants\".\n\nThe practice of forming kennings has traditionally been seen as a common Germanic inheritance, but this has been disputed since, among the early Germanic languages, their use is largely restricted to Old Norse and Old English poetry. A possible early kenning for \"gold\" (\"walha-kurna\" \"Roman/Gallic grain\") is attested in the Proto-Norse runic inscription on the Tjurkö (I)-C bracteate. Kennings are virtually absent from the surviving corpus of continental West Germanic verse; the Old Saxon Heliand contains only one example: \"lîk-hamo\" \"body-raiment\" = \"body\" (Heliand 3453 b), a compound which, in any case, is normal in West Germanic and North Germanic prose (Old English \"līchama\", Old High German \"lîchamo\", \"lîchinamo\", Dutch \"lichaam\", Old Icelandic \"líkamr\", \"líkami\", Old Swedish \"līkhamber\", Swedish \"lekamen\", Danish and Norwegian Bokmål \"legeme\", Norwegian Nynorsk \"lekam\").\n\nOld English kennings are all of the simple type, possessing just two elements, e.g. for \"sea\": \"seġl-rād\" \"sail-road\" (Beowulf 1429 b), \"swan-rād\" \"swan-road\" (Beowulf 200 a), \"bæð-weġ\" \"bath-way\" (Andreas 513 a), \"hron-rād\" \"whale-road\" (Beowulf 10), \"hwæl-weġ\" \"whale-way\" (The Seafarer 63 a). Most Old English examples take the form of compound words in which the first element is uninflected: \"heofon-candel\" \"sky-candle\" = \"the sun\" (Exodus 115 b). Kennings consisting of a genitive phrase occur too, but rarely: \"heofones ġim\" \"sky's jewel\" = \"the sun\" (The Phoenix 183).\n\nOld English poets often place a series of synonyms in apposition, and these may include kennings (loosely or strictly defined) as well as the literal referent: \"Hrōðgar maþelode, helm Scyldinga\" ... \"Hrothgar, helm (=protector, lord) of the Scyldings, said ...\" (Beowulf 456).\n\nAlthough the word \"kenning\" isn't often used for non-Germanic languages, a similar form can be found in Biblical poetry in its use of parallelism. Some examples include , in which \"blood of grapes\" is used as a kenning for \"wine\", and where \"born of woman\" is a parallel for \"man\".\n\nFigures of speech similar to kennings occur in Modern English (both in literature and in regular speech), and are often found in combination with other poetic devices. For example, the Madness song \"The Sun and the Rain\" contains the line \"standing up in the falling-down\", where \"the falling-down\" refers to rain and is used in juxtaposition to \"standing up\". Some recent English writers have attempted to use approximations of kennings in their work. John Steinbeck used kenning-like figures of speech in his 1950 novella \"Burning Bright\", which was adapted into a Broadway play that same year. According to Steinbeck biographer Jay Parini, \"The experiment is well-intentioned, but it remains idiosyncratic to the point of absurdity. Steinbeck invented compound phrases (similar to the Old English use of kennings), such as 'wife-loss' and 'friend-right' and 'laughter-starving,' that simply seem eccentric.\"\n\nKennings remain somewhat common in German (\"Drahtesel\" \"wire-donkey\" for bike, \"Feuerstuhl\" \"fire-chair\" for motorcycle, \"Stubentiger\" \"parlour-tiger\" for cat, and so on).\n\nThe poet Seamus Heaney regularly employed kennings in his work; for example, 'bone-house' for \"skeleton\".\n\n\n"}

Normally seen clothed in white, Lachesis is the measurer of the thread spun on Clotho's spindle, and in some texts, determines Destiny, or thread of life. Her Roman equivalent was Decima. Lachesis was the apportioner, deciding how much time for life was to be allowed for each person or being. She measured the thread of life with her rod. She is also said to choose a person's destiny after a thread was measured. In mythology, it is said that she appears with her sisters within three days of a baby's birth to decide its fate.\n\nAccording to Hesiod's Theogony, Lachesis and her sisters (Atropos and Clotho) were the daughters of Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night), though later in the same work (ll. 901-906) they are said to have been born of Zeus and Themis. Lachesis is also mentioned in the tenth book of the \"Republic\" of Plato as the daughter of Necessity. She instructs the souls who are about to choose their next life, assign them lots, and presents them all of the kinds, human and animal, from which they may choose their next life.\n\n\n"}

The fortress is located in the central Alburz mountains, south of the Caspian Sea, about 120 km from present-day Tehran, Iran. Lambesar is to the northeast of Razmian village (the central district of Roodbar e Shahrestan).\n\nKiya Buzurg Ummid (died 1138) captured the castle from Rasamuj and rebuilt it into a major stronghold using local labour. He was appointed by Hasan Sabbah (died 1124) as its governor.\n\nOnly ruins remain of this magnificent fortress today. Very deep valleys surrounding the fortress make it impossible to access from the East and West sides. The North and South fronts are the only possible ways to get into the fortress. Although the slope of the mountain with a difference of 150m on both levels is stretched from north to south with a length of 480m, the castle is more than 190m in width. The huge two-layered parapets made up of very large 10m high stones, along with the main building in the north of the fortress with 1.2m wide cut stone walls, wonderful water reservoirs and grain stores in the south and southeast of the castle, towers and a water supply system are among the characteristics and features left within the Lambesar fortress which intrigue visitors. In the North side of the fortress a huge building with 4 smaller extensions remain which face to the East.\n\nThe Ismailis’ forts were the last line of defense against Mongol aggression in Persia. The Mongols had a hard time conquering Ismailian's forts. Hulaku Khan was disappointed with his commanders therefore he took over an army of 10000 soldiers and moved toward Alamut. In 1256 AD after a couple months the Meymoon-Dej (Meymoon-Diž, ) fort surrendered to Hulaku’s army, and Imam Rukn-ud-Din Khurshah was captured. Hulaku Khan asked Rukn-ud-Din Khurshah to order his followers to surrender, but Lambesar fort, Gerdkuh fort and Alamut fort did not follow the order. Finally after a year of resisting, a cholera epidemic in 1257 AD took many lives in Lambesar and allowed the Mongols to succeed. Hulaku ordered the fort ruined and beheaded whoever had survived the deadly disease. In 1275 AD and again in 1389 AD, small groups of Ismailis who had survived the Mongol invasions attempted to recapture Alamut, but their attempts were short-lived.\n\n\n"}

In 1907 she met William Hebditch, a commercial traveller from Yorkshire who had stayed at the hotel run by her parents; the two were secretly married in Aberdeen and shortly after the couple left Scotland for Alberta in Canada, where Lorna Moon gave birth to her first child, William Hebditych (1908–1990), in 1908. In 1913 she left Hebditch and fell in with Walter Moon, with whom she had a child, Mary Leonore Moon (1914–1978). She and Walter travelled to Winnipeg, where she began working as a journalist and where she adopted a pen-name closer to her literary inspiration, Lorna Doone. An anecdote tells how she contacted Cecil B. DeMille and offered a critical appraisal of the screenplays of the day. He challenged her to come to Hollywood and write them herself if she thought she could do better; and by 1921 she did just that, working as a script girl and screenwriter. During her career in Hollywood she had a third child by Cecil B. DeMille’s brother William. This child, Richard, grew up unaware of his mother’s identity; in later years he discovered his parentage and wrote the memoir \"My Secret Mother, Lorna Moon\". Lorna Moon contracted tuberculosis and died in a sanatorium in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1930, aged 44. She was cremated and her ashes were returned to Scotland, to be scattered on Mormond Hill near Strichen.\n\nHer screen credits include \"The Affairs of Anatol\" (1921), \"Don't Tell Everything\" (1921), \"Her Husband's Trademark\" (1922), \"Too Much Wife\" (1922), \"Upstage\" (1926), \"After Midnight\" (1927), \"Women Love Diamonds\" (1927), \"Mr. Wu\" (1927), and \"Love\" (1927).\n\nHer literary works include \"Doorways in Drumorty\" (1925), a collection of short stories, and the novel \"Dark Star\" (1929). \"Dark Star\" was a critical success, and in 1930 was adapted for the screen as Min and Bill, starring Marie Dressler and Wallace Beery. \"Doorways in Drumorty\" contained a series of stories set in a fictional Scottish town: however the location and characters were drawn from her memories of Strichen, much to the indignation of certain of the townspeople, and her work was banned from the local library.\n\n\"The Collected Works of Lorna Moon\", edited by Glenda Norquay, was published in 2002. In 2008 a plaque commemorating Lorna Moon was unveiled in Strichen. In 2011 a stage play, based on the stories in \"Doorways in Drumorty\", was written by Mike Gibb and performed around Scotland by Red Rag Theatre. A film based on the life of Lorna Moon, scripted by Alison Peebles, has been proposed, with Kate Winslet being named as a potential candidate to play the title role.\n\n"}

{"id": "56884148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56884148", "title": "Michael Matusevitch", "text": "Michael Matusevitch\n\nMichael Matusevitch was a painter (1929 - 2007). He was born in Odessa, USSR (Ukraine in nowadays). \nMatusevitch started his painting career at school, where he was the class painter.\n\nIn 1941, Matusevitch and his brothers went for a summer vacation in the country with their grandparents. After two weeks, war broke out and it was impossible to return to his parents in Odessa, resulting in a long separation from their parents. The war period was hard. Matusevitch fled from the Nazis, making his way on foot and later by train, often exposed to bombing attacks. He passed cities in flames, suffered hunger and was wounded in the leg.\n\nIn the end, the group reached Tadzhikistan in Central Asia, and there Matusevitch finished grade school. The local population was made up of Moslems and a Russian minority, who suffered from an unfriendly, anti-Semitic and even cruel attitude, according to Matusevitch. \nMatusevitch spent many hours painting at that time; he made postcard copies of large paintings, and painted portraits from photographs. He tried to use oil colors for the first time, and since a few shades were missing, he mixed oil colors with gouache and acrylics. \nMatusevitch stood for hours watching the painters at work in the craft center beside his house.\n\nAt the end of the war, the family returned to Odessa in 1945. \nMatusevitch got a job as a welder in a factory, but he dreamed of being a painter, and to study in the Grekov Odessa Art school.\nAt the age of 19, Matusevitch passed the entrance examinations and was accepted despite heavy competition and the unofficial restrictions regarding Jews. His dream had come true. \nMatusevitch began his studies with great enthusiasm, but they were cut short in the middle of the first course, as he was recruited into the Red Army. Matusevitch served four years as a sailor on the Baltic Sea. He never saw his parents, but despite that, he used his time well in study, painting portraits of his friends and taking part in group exhibitions.\n\nIn 1953, Matusevitch returned to his study for an additional five years. The students were required to paint in the Socialist Realism mode, an outcome of the well-known slogan that the arts belonged to the people, and therefore the artist was the servant of the people. \nModern art was avoided, as it was regarded as bourgeois and therefore unacceptable.\n\nIn 1958, Matusevitch finished his studies. His parents, with whom he lived, helped him devote much of his time to painting. On this he says: “It was always important to me to paint what was close to my view on life. I was in a large Soviet city and from a Jewish family. My point of view was in a measure Jewish. I saw the closely packed life of the Jewish street, and this helped me to describe in painting the special atmosphere of Odessa. Some blamed me for painting Odessa as a village and not as a modern, official Soviet city. But this was the Odessa I loved. I felt that this atmosphere, so unique, was gradually disappearing.”\n\nAn important painter who greatly influenced Matusevitch was Vincent Van Gogh. When an exhibition of Van Gogh arrived in Moscow from the Netherlands, Matusevitch hurried to see it. He found many things in common with the great artist: an outlook of the world, a total devotion to art and also a ritual inclination in painting. \n\nIn 1962, Matusevitch participated in a group exhibition of Odessa artists. An article written on the exhibition noted and praised his painting: “A Spring Day with Horses.” \nSubsequently, the artist participated in many exhibitions organized by the confederation of painters in Odessa. The authorities were not enamored with his style and urged him to paint political subjects of note, but the public did like him very much, which was important for the artist. Pressure from the political establishment was the lot of many artists, among them several of Matusevitch’s friends: the painters Mezberg, Mazritsky, Ostrovsky, Shenkar and, closest to him, the excellent painter and poet, Sasha Richter.\n\nIn 1974, he arrived in Israel and immediately felt a deep affinity with the landscape, as though he had been there before, and he depicted the country in paint. Here, Matusevitch met Rima Kravitz, a doctor who loved art. In 1975, he married her, and he relates: “Rima admires me and helps me. I give her the credit for many of my successes.“\nMatusevitch received a warm welcome in Israel. A long list of exhibitions, a lecturer’s post at the People University and membership in the painters’ confederation, while he continued to create and establish himself in the Israeli family of artists.\n\nIn 1987, Matusevitch finally opened his own gallery in Tel-Aviv. He had people passing by, events, he sold some of his paintings, and he kept painting new ones. It was a dream that came true for Matusevitch. \n\nMatusevitch passed away in 2007, after an illness he suffered for the last few years of his life. Matusevitch left behind him more than 400 paintings, which stayed since then in the gallery, that was close the whole time. Rima Kravitz, he's wife, didn't have the time and courage to manage the gallery, as a full time doctor, although she wanted very much.\n\nIn 2017, Matusevitch's grandson - Bar Matusevitch, in his twenties, decided to take responsibility for the gallery. As times changed, he created an online gallery, together with Rima, as they realized that was what Matusevitch would have want the most - all of his paintings are available worldwide - . It was a dream that came true for the Matusevitch family.\n\n"}

He lives and works in Paris and Brussels.\n\nHe holds an engineering degree and a Master of Design from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts et Métiers. His engineering thesis focused on nonlinear optical elements (holograms) for avionics (head-up display). This initial specialization in optics has earned him early in his career as a research engineer, first in the avionics division of Thomson Csf (now Thales Group) and at CERN in Geneva.\n\nIn 1984, he takes the status of independent consulting engineer for the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie (Paris), then under construction, to work first on the development of exhibits, then quickly as project manager responsible for the design and development of several permanent and temporary exhibitions. As such, between 1984 and 1996, he designed the scenario and led the implementation of several highly technological exhibitions and media on science issues as diverse as: the sun, mathematics, electricity, symmetry in the arts and science, non-verbal human behavior, etc. In this period, he also developed some exhibition projects for other cultural institutions, such as the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Institut du Monde Arabe, the Palais de la Découverte. The creation for the \"Expressions et behaviours\" exhibition inaugurated in early 1987, marked a milestone in his career, leading him from a predominantly scientific and technical culture to another more artistic and open to all components of the humanities.\n\nEnd of 1987, while working with Tod Machover (MIT Medialab) and Catherine Ikam (artist) for the staging of VALIS, a contemporary music opera based on the work of Philip K. Dick, he designed what would become his best known work, the \"Poietic Generator\", a free social artwork for all that can be played in real time over a network. In 1988, this work became the central concept of a monumental, architectural and technological project, one of the seven laureates of the international competition for the creation of the \"France-Japan Monument\" on Awaji Island in the Bay of Kobe, launched under the aegis of François Mitterrand. This Monument never saw the daylight, but its various implementations were exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou (exhibition \"Communication et Monumentalité\", 1989), the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie (exhibition \"Machines à communiquer\", 1994) and in various galleries and art events including ARSLAB in 1995, where Olivier Auber was awarded the prize \"art and science\" by the city of Turin, Italy. The exhibition \"ARSLAB - The senses of virtuality\", sponsored by the City of Turin - Promoter of Fine Arts, was organized by Ars Technica and Extramuseum and was curated by Claude Faure, Maria Grazia Mattei and Franco Torriani \n\nIn 1995 still, he was invited to the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications (now Télécom ParisTech) to develop his project, not just on the web, but on an experimental network foreshadowing the future shape of the Internet (Mbone) which allowed him to perform what is considered as the first experience of real-time collective interaction over the Internet without the intermediary of any center.\n\nIn 1996, he developed a version of Poietic Generator for the web in order to let every one access to it. Several experiments followed through electronic art festivals and academic research: Ljubljana (1998), X-00 (2000), Human-Computer Interaction Conference IHM-UTC(2002, L3D Lab, University of Colorado at Boulder in (2002), and so on.\n\nIn 1997 he co-founded the A+H Culture Laboratory, with Bernd Hoge (architect and urban planner), Emmanuel Mâa Berriet (developer of virtual reality) and Philippe Braunstein (film producer), in order to develop interdisciplinary projects. One of the first is the creation of the in Worms Germany. One of the pieces in the museum, the virtual reality installation \"The treasure of the Nibelungs\", inspired by the Poietic Generator, was also exhibited in numerous festivals, including ISEA 2000 (Paris) and Boston CyberArts 2001.\n\nIn 2002, he co-founded with Nils Aziosmanoff and Etienne Krieger the company Navidis which brings innovative solutions to the Smart City users.\n\nIn 2004, he co-founded with visual artist Yann Le Guennec the research group Anoptique that developed dataviz experiences on the Internet. In this regard were conducted several projects in partnership with the Fondation Internet Nouvelle Génération (FING), Orange Lab/France Telecom R&D and INRIA, which led from 2005 on the development of many visualization tools. Anoptique commonly advised organizations such as UNESCO, the Ministry of Culture, the French Development Agency on their strategy of free software, groupware, interactive mapping and open data.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, he contributed to the creation of a transdisciplinary Research Chair at Telecom ParisTech devoted to \"modeling imaginary\" with the help of Dassault Systèmes, Ubisoft, Orange Lab, Peugeot-Citroen, Alcatel Lucent, BNP Paribas, Datar and Minatec.\n\nSince 2012, Olivier Auber divides his time between consultancy, design of cultural and art projects, and research and development on the Poietic Generator. He also contributes to many working groups, as a research associate of the transdisciplinary research group \"Evolution, Complexity and Cognition\" and the Global Brain Institute directed by Francis Heylighen, and as an active member of the P2P Foundation.\n\nFrom 1986, Olivier Auber theorized the Poietic Generator as an experience of two new kinds of perspectives, analogous to the spatial perspective of the Renaissance: the \"temporal perspective\" and the \"digital perspective\", on which he wrote several papers whose terms were continued in the works of many philosophers and historians of art and science, including Anne Cauquelin, Don Foresta, , Mario Costa, Caterina Davinio, Jean-Paul Fourmentraux, Louis-José Lestocart, Elisa Giaccardi, and Norbert Hillaire, Jean-Michel Cornu, Franco Torriani, etc..\n\n\n\n\n"}

The current 15th century Gothic church replaced an older Romanesque one. Archaeological excavations have revealed the existence of other two previous churches. The Neoclassical façade was designed by Ventura Rodríguez in 1783. It has a 13th-14th-century Gothic cloister, that gives access to two other Gothic rooms: the Barbazan chapel and the refectory. The Mediaeval kings of Navarre were crowned there and some of them were also buried. The Navarrese \"Cortes\" (Parliament) was held there even during the early modern ages.\n\nThe site of the cathedral is the oldest part of the Roman \"Pompaelo\". Archaeological excavations in 1994 have revealed streets and buildings from the 1st century BC. The oldest cathedral was demolished in 924 during the invasion of Abd-al-Rahman III, Caliph of Cordoba. During the reign of Sancho III (1004–1035) the church was reconstructed. That church was demolished from 1083 to 1097, and the Romanesque cathedral was built from 1100 to 1127. It collapsed in 1391, with only the façade remaining. The building of the current Gothic church began in 1394 and lasted to 1501. The floorplan is cruciform with ambulatory, a central nave and four shorter aisles, all covered by partially polycromed rib vault. The style is very influenced by French models.\n\nThe sculpture of the interior includes the sepulchre of Charles III of Navarre and spouse, by Jehan Lome de Tournai (1419), and the image of Royal Saint Mary, a Romanesque woodcarved silverplated sculpture. The choir, with its Renaissance choir stalls (1541), is separated from the nave by a Gothic iron grating (1517). There was a Renaissance retable (1598) in the presbytery, now in the church of Saint Michael in Pamplona. In the lateral chapels there are two Gothic retables (c.1500, 1507); one Italian Renaissance retable (16th century); one late Renaissance retable (1610, polycromed in 1617); and five Baroque retables (1642, 1683, 1685).\n\nProbably, the most outstanding element of the cathedral is its 13th century cloister. As the temple, the style followed the French Gothic architecture, and the sculptural decoration is very rich. The door that gives access from the temple shows the Dormition of the Virgin, and at the mullion stands a 15th-century sculpture of the Virgin Mary. The Barbazan chapel—named after the Pamplonese bishop buried there, Arnaldo de Barbazán—is covered by a Gothic eight-rib vault. The so-called 'Precious Door' gives access to the ancient canons' dormitory and shows a complete sculptural story of the Virgin Mary's life. There are several notable burials: Bishop Miguel Sánchez de Asiáin's (14th century), Viceroy of Navarre Count of Gages' (Baroque, 18th century) and guerrilla fighter Francisco Espoz y Mina's (Neo-classical, 19th century). The lavatory is closed by a grid whose iron is said to be from the battle of Navas de Tolosa. Another decorated Gothic door gives access to the old kitchen and the refectory.\n\nThe former canons' rooms house the Diocesan Museum. The main room is a 14th-century rib-vault covered refectory. The adjacent kitchen is covered by a pyramidal stone-built chimney. This museum exhibits pieces of religious art from the cathedral and from many other Navarrese churches, many of them abandoned today: Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque sculpture, Gothic and Baroque painting, and 13th to 18th centuries goldsmith and silversmith.\n\nThe most outstanding silversmith pieces are the Gothic Holy Sepulcher reliquary, made in 13th century Paris; the 14th century \"Lignum Crucis\" reliquary and the Renaissance 16th century processional monstrance.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1457406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1457406", "title": "Red-figure pottery", "text": "Red-figure pottery\n\nRed-figure vase painting is one of the most important styles of figural Greek vase painting.\n\nIt developed in Athens around 520 BC and remained in use until the late 3rd century BC. It replaced the previously dominant style of black-figure vase painting within a few decades. Its modern name is based on the figural depictions in red colour on a black background, in contrast to the preceding black-figure style with black figures on a red background. The most important areas of production, apart from Attica, were in Southern Italy. The style was also adopted in other parts of Greece. Etruria became an important centre of production outside the Greek World.\n\nAttic red-figure vases were exported throughout Greece and beyond. For a long time, they dominated the market for fine ceramics. Only few centres of pottery production could compete with Athens in terms of innovation, quality and production capacity. Of the red figure vases produced in Athens alone, more than 40,000 specimens and fragments survive today. From the second most important production centre, Southern Italy, more than 20,000 vases and fragments are preserved. Starting with the studies by John D. Beazley and Arthur Dale Trendall, the study of this style of art has made enormous progress. Some vases can be ascribed to individual artists or schools. The images provide evidence for the exploration of Greek cultural history, everyday life, iconography, and mythology.\n\nRed figure is, put simply, the reverse of the black figure technique. Both were achieved by using the three-phase firing technique. The paintings were applied to the shaped but unfired vessels after they had dried to a leathery, near-brittle texture. In Attica, the normal unburnt clay was of orange colour at this stage. The outlines of the intended figures were drawn either with a blunt scraper, leaving a slight groove, or with charcoal, which would disappear entirely during firing. Then the contours were redrawn with a brush, using a glossy clay slip. Occasionally, the painter decided to somewhat change the figurative scene. In such cases the grooves from the original sketch sometimes remain visible. Important contours were often drawn with a thicker slip, leading to a slightly protruding outline (relief line); less important lines and internal details were drawn with diluted glossy clay.\n\nDetail in other colours, like white or red, were applied at this point. The relief line was probably drawn with a bristle brush or a hair, dipped in thick paint. The suggestion of a hollow needle seems somewhat unlikely. The application of relief outlines was necessary, as the rather liquid glossy clay would otherwise have turned out too dull. After the technique's initial phase of development, both alternatives were used, so as to differentiate gradations and details more clearly. The space between figures was filled with a glossy grey clay slip. Then, the vases underwent triple-phase firing, during which the glossy clay reached its characteristic black or black-brown colour through reduction, the reddish color by a final re-oxidation. Since this final oxidizing phase was fired using lower temperatures, the glazed parts of the vase did not re-oxidize from black to red: their finer surface was melted (sintered) in the reducing phase, and now protected from oxygen.\nThe new technique had the primary advantage of permitting a far better execution of internal detail. In black-figure vase painting such details had to be scratched into the painted surfaces, which was always less accurate than the direct application of detail with a brush. Red-figure depictions were generally more lively and realistic than the black-figure silhouettes. They were also more clearly contrasted against the black backgrounds. It was now possible to depict humans not only in profile, but also in frontal, rear, or three-quarter perspectives. The red-figure technique also permitted the indication of a third dimension on the figures. However, it also had disadvantages. For example, the distinction of sex by using black slip for male skin and white paint for female skin was now impossible. The ongoing trend to depict heroes and deities naked and of youthful age also made it harder to distinguish the sexes through garments or hairstyles. In the initial phases, there were also miscalculations regarding the thickness of human figures.\n\nIn black-figure vase painting, the pre-drawn outlines were a part of the figure. In red-figure vases, the outline would, after firing, form part of the black background. This led to vases with very thin figures early on. A further problem was that the black background did not permit the depiction of space in any depth, so that spatial perspective was almost never attempted. Nonetheless, the advantages outnumbered the disadvantages. The depiction of muscles and other anatomical details clearly illustrates the development of the style.\n\nBlack figure vase painting had been developed in Corinth in the 7th century BC and quickly became the dominant style of pottery decoration throughout the Greek world and beyond. Although Corinth dominated the overall market, regional markets and centres of production did develop. Initially, Athens copied the Corinthian style, but it gradually came to rival and overcome the dominance of Corinth. Attic artists developed the style to an unprecedented quality, reaching the apex of their creative possibilities in the second third of the 6th century BC. Exekias, active around 530 BC, can be seen as the most important representative of the black-figure style.\n\nThe first red-figure vases were produced around 530 BC. The invention of the technique normally is accredited to the Andokides Painter. He, and other early representatives of the style, e.g. Psiax, initially painted vases in both styles, with black-figure scenes on one side, and red-figure on the other. Such vases, e.g. the Belly Amphora by the Andokides Painter (Munich 2301), are called bilingual vases. Although they display major advances against the black figure style, the figures still appear somewhat stilted and seldom overlap. Compositions and techniques of the older style remained in use. Thus, incised lines are quite common, as is the additional application of red paint (\"added red\") to cover large areas.\n\nThe artists of the so-called \"Pioneer Group\" made the step towards a full exploitation of the possibilities of the red-figure technique. They were active between \"circa\" 520 and 500 BC. Important representatives include Euphronios, Euthymides and Phintias. This group, recognised and defined by twentieth-century scholarship, experimented with the different possibilities offered by the new style. Thus, figures appeared in new perspectives, such as frontal or rear views, and there were experiments with perspective foreshortening and more dynamic compositions. As a technical innovation Euphronios introduced the \"relief line\". At the same time new vase shapes were invented, a development favoured by the fact that many of the pioneer group painters were also active as potters.\nNew shapes include the \"psykter\" and the \"pelike\". Large \"krater\" and \"amphorae\" became popular at this time. Although there is no indication that the painters understood themselves as a group in the way that modern scholarship does, there were some connections and mutual influences, perhaps in an atmosphere of friendly competition and encouragement. Thus, a vase by Euthymides is inscribed \"as Euphronios never [would have been able]\". More generally, the pioneer group tended to use inscriptions. The labelling of mythological figures or the addition of Kalos inscriptions are the rule rather than the exception.\n\nApart from the vase painters, some bowl painters also used the new style. These include Oltos and Epiktetos. Many of their works were bilingual, often using red-figure only on the interior of the bowl.\n\nThe generation of artists after the pioneers, active during the Late Archaic period (\"circa\" 500 to 470 BC) brought the style to a new flourish. During this time, black-figure vases failed to reach the same quality and were pushed out of the market eventually. Some of the most famous Attic vase painters belong to this generation. They include the Berlin Painter, the Kleophrades Painter, and among the bowl painters Onesimos, Douris, Makron and the Brygos Painter. The improvement of quality went along with a doubling of output during this period. Athens became the dominant producer of fine pottery in the Mediterranean world, overshadowing nearly all other production centres.\n\nOne of the key features of this most successful Attic vase painting style is the mastery of perspective foreshortening, allowing a much more naturalistic depiction of figures and actions. Another characteristic is the drastic reduction of figures per vessel, of anatomic details, and of ornamental decorations. In contrast, the repertoire of depicted scenes was increased. For example, the myths surrounding Theseus became very popular at this time. New or modified vase shapes were frequently employed, including the Nolan amphora (see Typology of Greek Vase Shapes), lekythoi, as well as bowls of the \"askos\" and \"dinos\" types. The specialisation into separate vase and bowl painters increased.\n\nThe key characteristic of Early Classical figures is that they are often somewhat stockier and less dynamic than their predecessors. As a result, the depictions gained seriousness, even \"pathos\". The folds of garments were depicted less linearly, thus appearing more plastic. The manner of presenting scenes also changed substantially. Firstly, the paintings ceased to focus on the moment of a particular event, but rather, with dramatic tension, showed the situation immediately before the action, thus implying and contextualising the event proper. Also, some of the other new achievements of Athenian democracy began to show an influence on vase painting. Thus, influences of tragedy and of wall painting can be detected. Since Greek wall painting is almost entirely lost today, its reflection on vases constitutes one of the few, albeit modest, sources of information on that genre of art. Other influences on High Classical vase painting include the newly erected Parthenon and its sculptural decoration. This is especially visible in the depiction of garments; the material now falls more naturally, and more folds are depicted, leading to an increased \"depth\" of the depiction. The overall compositions were simplified even more. Artists placed special emphasis on symmetry, harmony, and balance. The human figures had returned to their earlier slenderness; often they radiate a self-absorbed, divine serenity.\n\nImportant painters of this period, roughly 480 to 425 BC, include the Providence Painter, Hermonax, and the Achilles Painter, all following the tradition of the Berlin Painter. The Phiale Painter, probably a pupil of the Achilles Painter, is also important. New workshop traditions also developed. Notable examples include the so-called \"mannerists\", most famously among them the Pan Painter. Another tradition was begun by the Niobid Painter and continued by Polygnotos, the Kleophon Painter, and the Dinos Painter. The role of bowls decreased, although they were still produced in large numbers, e.g. by the workshop of the Penthesilea Painter.\n\nDuring the Late Classical period, in the final quarter of the 5th century, two opposed trends were created. On the one hand, a style of vase painting strongly influenced by the \"Rich Style\" of sculpture developed, on the other, some workshops continued the developments of the High Classical period, with an increased emphasis on the depiction of emotion, and a range of erotic scenes. The most important representative of the Rich Style is the Meidias Painter. Characteristic features include transparent garments and multiple folds of cloth. There is also an increase in the depiction of jewellery and other objects. The use of additional colours, mostly white and gold, depicting accessories in a low relief, is very striking. Over time, there is a marked \"softening\": The male body, heretofore defined by the depiction of muscles, gradually lost that key feature.\n\nThe paintings depicted mythological scenes less frequently than before. Images of the private and domestic world became more and more important. Scenes from the life of women are especially frequent. Mythological scenes are dominated by images of Dionysos and Aphrodite. It is not clear what caused this change of depicted topic among some of the artists. Suggestions include a context with the horrors of the Peloponnesian War, but also the loss of Athens' dominant role in the Mediterranean pottery trade (itself partially a result of the war). The increasing role of new markets, e.g. Iberia, implied new needs and wishes on part of the customers. These theories are contradicted by the fact that some artists maintained the earlier style. Some, e.g. the Eretria Painter, attempted to combine both traditions. The best works of the Late Classical period are often found on smaller vessels, such as belly \"lekythoi\", \"pyxides\" and \"oinochai\". \"Lekanis\", Bell krater(seeTypology of Greek Vase Shapes) and \"hydria\" were also popular.\n\nThe production of mainstream red-figure pottery ceased around 360 BC. The Rich and Simple styles both existed until that time. Late representatives include the Meleager Painter (Rich Style) and the Jena Painter (Simple Style).\n\nThe final decades of Attic red—figure vase painting are dominated by the Kerch Style. This style, current between 370 and 330 BC, combined the preceding Rich and Modest Styles, with a preponderance of the Rich. Crowded compositions with large statuesque figures are typical. The added colours now include blue, green and others. Volume and shading are indicated by the use of diluted runny glossy clay. Occasionally, whole figures are added as appliques, i.e. as thin figural reliefs attached to the body of the vase. The variety of vessel shapes in use was reduced sharply. Common painted shapes include \"pelike\", chalice \"krater\", belly \"lekythos\", \"skyphos\", \"hydria\" and \"oinochoe\". Scenes from female life are very common. Mythological themes are still dominated by Dionysos; Ariadne and Heracles are the most commonly depicted heroes. The best-known painter of this style is the Marsyas Painter.\n\nThe last Athenian vases with figural depictions were created around 320 BC at the latest. The style continued somewhat longer, but with non-figural decorations. The last recognised examples are by painters known as the YZ Group.\n\nThe Kerameikos was the potters' quarter of Athens. It contained a variety of small workshops, and probably a few larger ones. In 1852, during building activity in Ermou Street, the workshop of the Jena Painter was discovered. The artefacts from it are now on display in the University collection of the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena. According to modern research, the workshops were owned by the potters. The names of about 40 Attic vase painters are known, from vase inscriptions, usually accompanied by the words (égrapsen, has painted). In contrast, the signature of the potter, (epoíesen, has made) has survived on more than twice as many, namely about 100, pots (both numbers refer to the totality of Attic figural vase painting). Although signatures had been known since c. 580 BC (first known signature by the potter Sophilos), their use increased to an apex around the Pioneering Phase. A changing, apparently increasingly negative, attitude to artisans led to a reduction of signatures, starting during the Classical period at the latest. Overall, signatures are quite rare. The fact that they are mostly found on especially good pieces indicates that they expressed the pride of potter and/or painter.<ref name=\"Ingeborg Scheibler P 12/I\">Ingeborg Scheibler: \"Vasenmaler\", in: DNP 12/I, col. 1147f.</ref>\nThe status of painters in relation to that of potters remains somewhat unclear. The fact that, e.g., Euphronius was able to work as both painter and potter suggests that at least some of the painters were not slaves. On the other hand, some of the known names indicate that there were at least some former slaves and some \"perioikoi\" among the painters. Additionally, some of the names are not unique: for example, several painters signed as Polygnotos. This may represent attempts to profit from the name of that great painter. The same may be the case where painters bear otherwise famous names, like Aristophanes (vase painter). The careers of some vase painters are quite well known. Apart from painters with relatively short periods of activity (one or two decades), some can be traced for much longer. Examples include Douris, Makron, Hermonax and the Achilles Painter. The fact that several painters later became potters, and the relatively frequent cases where it is unclear whether some potters were also painters or \"vice versa\", suggest a career structure, perhaps starting with an apprenticeship involving mainly painting, and leading up to being a potter. This division of labours appears to have developed along with the introduction of red-figure painting, since many potter-painters are known from the black-figure period (including Exekias, Nearchos and perhaps the Amasis Painter). The increased demand for exports would have led to new structures of production, encouraging specialisation and division of labour, leading to a sometimes ambiguous distinction between painter and potter. As mentioned above, the painting of vessels was probably mainly the responsibility of younger assistants or apprentices. Some further conclusions regarding the organisational aspects of pottery production can be suggested. It appears that generally, several painters worked for one pottery workshop, as indicated by the fact that frequently, several roughly contemporary pots by the same potter are painted by various painters. For examples, pots made by Euphronios have been found to be painted by Onesimos, Douris, the Antiphon Painter, the Triptolemos Painter and the Pistoxenos Painter. Conversely, an individual painter could also change from one workshop to another. For example, the bowl painter Oltos worked for at least six different potters.\nAlthough from a modern perspective the vase painters are often considered as artists, and their vases thus as works of art, this view is not consistent with that held in antiquity. Vase painters, like potters, were considered as craftsmen, their produce as trade goods. The craftsmen must have had a reasonably high level of education, as a variety of inscriptions occur. On the one hand, the aforementioned Kalos inscriptions are common, on the other hand, inscriptions often label the depicted figures. That not every vase painter could write is shown by some examples of meaningless rows of random letters. The vases indicate a steady improvement of literacy from the 6th century BC onwards. Whether potters, and perhaps vase painters, belonged to the Attic elite has not been satisfactorily clarified so far. Do the frequent depictions of the symposium, a definite upper-class activity, reflect the painters' personal experience, their aspirations to attend such events, or simply the demands of the market? A large proportion of the painted vases produced, such as \"psykter\", \"krater\", \"kalpis\", \"stamnos\", as well as \"kylikes\" and \"kantharoi\", were made and bought to be used at symposia.\n\nElaborately painted vases were good, but not the best, table wares available to a Greek. Metal vessels, especially from precious metals, were held in higher regard. Nonetheless, painted vases were not cheap products; the larger specimens, especially, were expensive. Around 500 BC, a large painted vase cost about one drachma, equivalent to the daily wage of a stonemason. It has been suggested that the painted vases represent an attempt to imitate metal vessels. It is normally assumed that the lower social classes tended to use simple undecorated coarse wares, massive quantities of which are found in excavations. Tablewares made of perishable materials, like wood, may have been even more widespread. Nonetheless, multiple finds of red-figure vases, usually not of the highest quality, found in settlements, prove that such vessels were used in daily life. A large proportion of production was taken up by cult and grave vessels. In any case, it can be assumed that the production of high-quality pottery was a profitable business. For example, an expensive votive gift by the painter Euphronios was found on the Athenian Acropolis. There can be little doubt that the export of such pottery made an important contribution to the affluence of Athens. It is hardly surprising that many workshops appear to have aimed their production at export markets, for example by producing vessel shapes that were more popular in the target region than in Athens. The 4th century BC demise of Attic vase painting tellingly coincides with the very period when the Etruscans, probably the main western export market, came under increasing pressure from South Italian Greeks and the Romans. A further reason for the end of the production of figurally decorated vases is a change in tastes at the start of the Hellenistic period. The main reason, however, should be seen in the increasingly unsuccessful progress of the Peloponnesian War, culminating in the devastating defeat of Athens in 404 BC. After this, Sparta controlled the western trade, albeit without having the economic strength to fully exploit it. The Attic potters had to find new markets; they did so in the Black Sea area. But Athens and its industries never fully recovered from the defeat. Some potters and painters had already relocated to Italy during the war, seeking better economic conditions. A key indicator for the export-oriented nature of Attic vase production is the nearly total absence of theatre scenes. Buyers from other cultural backgrounds, such as Etruscans or later customers in the Iberian Peninsula, would have found such depiction incomprehensible or uninteresting. In Southern Italian vase painting, which was mostly not aimed at export, such scenes are quite common.\n\nAt least from a modern point of view, the Southern Italian red-figure vase paintings represent the only region of production that reaches Attic standards of artistic quality. After the Attic vases, the South Italian ones (including those from Sicily), are the most thoroughly researched. In contrastic to their Attic counterparts, they were mostly produced for local markets. Only few pieces have been found outside Southern Italy and Sicily. The first workshops were founded in the mid-5th century BC by Attic potters. Soon, local craftsmen were trained and the thematic and formal dependence on Attic vases overcome. Towards the end of the century, the distinctive \"ornate style\" and \"plain style\" developed in Apulia. Especially the ornate style was adopted by other mainland schools, but without reaching the same quality.\n\nBy now, 21,000 South Italian vases and fragments are known. Of those, 11,000 are ascribed to Apulian workshops, 4,000 to Campanian, 2,000 to Paestan, 1,500 to Lucanian and 1,000 to Sicilian ones.\n\nThe Apulian vase painting tradition is considered as the leading South Italian style. The main centre of production was at Taras. Apulian red-figure vases were produced from \"circa\" 430 to 300 BC. The plain and ornate styles are distinguished. The main difference between them is that the plain style favoured bell \"craters\", column \"kraters\" and smaller vessels, and that a single \"plain\" vessel rarely depicted more than four figures. The main subjects were mythological scenes, female heads, warriors in scenes of combat of farewell, and dionysiac thiasos imagery. The reverse often showed youths wearing cloaks. The key feature of these simply decorated wares is the general absence of additional colours. Important plain style representatives are the Sisyphus Painter and the Tarporley Painter. After the mid-4th century BC, the style grows more and more similar to the ornate style. An important artist of that period is the Varrese Painter.\n\nThe artists using the ornate style tended to favour large vessels, like volute \"kraters\", \"amphorae\", \"loutrophoroi\" and \"hydriai\". The larger surface area was used to depict up to 20 figures, often in several registers on the body of the vase. Additional colours, especially shades of red, yellow-gold and white are used copiously. Since the 2nd half of the 4th century, the necks and sides of the vases are decorated with rich vegetal or ornamental decorations. At the same time, perspective views, especially of buildings such as \"Palace of Hades\" (\"naiskoi\"), develop. Since 360 BC, such structures are often depicted in scenes connected with burial rites (\"naiskos\" vases). Important representatives of this style are the Ilioupersis Painter, the Darius Painter and the Baltimore Painter. Mythological scenes were especially popular: The assembly of the Gods, the amazonomachy, the Trojan War, Heracles and Bellerophon. Additionally, such vases frequently depict scenes from myths that are only rarely illustrated on vases. Some specimens represent the single source for the iconography of a particular myth. Another subject that is unknown from Attic vase painting are the theatre scenes. Especially farce scenes, e.g. from the so-called \"phlyax\" vases are quite common. Scenes of athletic activity or everyday life only occur in the early phase, they disappear entirely after 370 BC.\n\nApulian vase painting had a formative influence on the traditions of the other South Italian production centres. It is assumed that individual Apulian artists settled in other Italian cities and contributed their skills there. Apart from red-figure, Apulia also produced black-varnished vases with painted decor (Gnathia vases) and polychrome vases (Canosa vases).\n\nCampania also produced red-figure vases in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. The light brown clay of Campania was covered with a slip that developed a pink or red tint after firing. The Campanian painters preferred smaller vessel types, but also \"hydriai\" and bell \"kraters\". The most popular shape is the bow-handled amphora. Many typical Apulian vessel shapes, like volute \"kraters\", column \"kraters\", \"loutrophoroi\", \"rhyta\" and \"nestoris\" amphorae are absent, \"pelikes\" are rare. The repertoire of motifs is limited. Subjects include youths, women, thiasos scenes, birds and animals, and often native warriors. The backs often show cloaked youths. Mythological scenes and depictions related to burial rites play a subsidiary role. \"Naiskos scenes\", ornamental elements and polychromy are adopted after 340 BC under Lucanian influence.\n\nBefore the immigration of Sicilian potters in the second quarter of the 4th century BC, when several workshops were established in Campania, only the Owl-Pillar Workshop of the second half of the 5th century is known. Campanian vase painting is subdivided in three main groups:\n\nThe first group is represented by the Kassandra Painter from Capua, still under Sicilian influence. He was followed by the workshop of the Parrish Painter and that of the Laghetto Painter and the Caivano Painter. Their work is characterised by a preference for satyr figures with thyrsos, depictions of heads (normally below the handles of \"hydriai\"), decorative borders of garments, and the frequent use of additional white, red and yellow. The Laghetto and Caivano Painters appear to have moved to Paestum later.\n\nThe AV Group also had its workshop in Capua. Of particular importance is the Whiteface-Frignano Painter, one of the first in this group. His typical characteristic is the use of additional white paint to depict the faces of women. This group favoured domestic scenes, women and warriors. Multiple figures are rare, usually there is only one figure each on the front and back of the vase, sometimes only the head. Garments are usually drawn casually.\n\nAfter 350 BC, the CA Painter and his successors worked in Cumae. The CA painter is considered as the outstanding artist of his group, or even of Campanian vase painting as a whole. From 330 onwards, a strong Apulian influence is visible. The most common motifs are \"naiskos\" and grave scenes, dionysiac scenes and symposia. Depictions of bejewelled female heads are also common. The CA painter was polychrome but tended to use much white for architecture and female figures. His successors were not fully able to maintain his quality, leading to a rapid demise, terminating with the end of Campanian vase painting around 300 BC.\n\nThe Lucanian vase painting tradition began around 430 BC, with the works of the Pisticci Painter. He was probably active in Pisticci, where some of his works were discovered. He was strongly influenced by Attic tradition. His successors, the Amycus Painter and the Cyclops Painter had a workshop in Metapontum. They were the first to paint the new \"nestoris\" (see Typology of Greek Vase Shapes) vase type. Mythical or theatrical scenes are common. For example, the Cheophoroi painter, named after the Cheophoroi by Aeschylos showed scenes from the tragedy in question on several of his vases. The influence of Apulian vase painting becomes tangible roughly at the same time. Especially polychromy and vegetal decor became standard. Important representatives of this style include the Dolon Painter and the Brooklyn-Budapest Painter. Towards the mid-4th century BC, a massive drop in quality and thematic variety becomes notable. The last notable Lucanian vase painter was the Primato Painter, strongly influenced by the Apulian Lycourgos Painter. After him, a short rapid demise is followed by the cessation of Lucanian vase painting at the start of the last quarter of the 4th century BC.\n\nThe Paestan vase painting style developed as the last of the South Italian styles. It was founded by Sicilian immigrants around 360 BC. the first workshop was controlled by Asteas and Python. They are the only South Italian vase painters known from inscriptions. They mainly painted bell \"kraters\", neck amphorae, \"hydriai\", \"lebes gamikos\", \"lekanes\", \"lekythoi\" and jugs, more rarely \"pelikes\", chalice \"kraters\" and volute \"kraters\". Characteristics include decorations such as lateral palmettes, a pattern of tendrils with calyx and umbel known as \"asteas flower\", crenelation-like patterns on garments and curly hair hanging over the back of figures. Figures that bend forwards, resting on plants or rocks, are equally common. Special colours are used often, especially white, gold, black, purple and shades of red.\n\nThe themes depicted often belong to the Dionysiac cycle: thiasos and symposium scenes, satyrs, maenads, Silenos, Orestes, Electra, the gods Aphrodite and Eros, Apollo, Athena and Hermes. Paestan painting rarely depicts domestic scenes, but favours animals. Asteas and Python had a major influence on the vase painting of Paestum. This is clearly visible in the work of the Aphrodite Painter, who probably immigrated from Apulia. Around 330 BC, a second workshop developed, originally following the work of the first. The quality of its painting and variety of its motifs deteriorated quickly. At the same time, an influence by the Campanian Caivano Painter becomes notable, garments falling in a linear fashion and contourless female figures followed. Around 300 BC, Paestan vase painting came to a halt.\n\nThe production of Sicilian vase painting began before the end of the 5th century BC, in the poleis of Himera and Syracusae. In terms of style, themes, ornamentation and vase shapes, the workshops were strongly influenced by the Attic tradition, especially by the Late Classical Meidias Painter. In the second quarter of the 4th century, Sicilian vase painters emigrated to Campania and Paestum, where they introduced red-figure vase painting. Only Syracusae retained a limited production.\n\nThe typical Sicilian style only developed around 340 BC. Three groups of workshops can be distinguished. The first, known as the Lentini-Manfria Group, was active in Syracusae and Gela, a second, making Centuripe Ware around Mt. Aetna, and a third on Lipari. The most typical feature of Sicilian vase painting is the use of additional colours, especially white. In the early phase, large vessels like chalice \"kraters\" and \"hydriai\" were painted, but smaller vessels like flasks, \"lekanes\", \"lekythoi\" and skyphoid \"pyxides\" are more typical. The most common motifs are scenes from female life, \"erotes\", female heads and \"phlyax\" scenes. Mythological scenes are rare. Like in all other areas, vase painting disappears from Sicily around 300 BC.\n\nIn contrast to black-figure vase painting, red-figure vase painting developed few regional traditions, workshops or \"schools\" outside Attica and Southern Italy. The few exceptions include some workshops in Boeotia (Painter of the Great Athens Kantharos), Chalkidike, Elis, Eretria, Corinth and Laconia.\n\nOnly Etruria, one of the main export markets for Attic vases, developed its own schools and workshops, eventually exporting its own products. The adoption of red-figure painting, imitating Athenian vases, occurred only after 490 BC, half a century after the style had been developed. Because of the technique used, the earliest examples are known as pseudo-red-figure vase paintings. The true red-figure technique was introduced much later, near the end of the 5th century BC. Several painters, workshops and production centres are known for both styles. Their products were not only used locally, but also exported to Malta, Carthage, Rome and Liguria.\n\nThe early Etrurian examples merely imitated the red-figure technique. Similar to a rare and early Attic technique (see Six's technique), the whole vessel was covered with black glossy clay and figures were applied afterwards using mineral colours that would oxidise red or white. Thus, in contrast to contemporary Attic vase painting, the red colour was not achieved by leaving areas unpainted but by adding paint to the black prime layer. Like in black-figure vases, internal detail was not painted on, but incised into the figures. Important representatives of this style include the Praxias Painter and other masters from his workshop in Vulci. In spite of their evident good knowledge of Greek myth and iconography, there is no evidence to indicate that these painters had immigrated from Attica. An exception to this may be the Praxia Painter, as Greek inscription on four of his vases may indicate that he originated from Greece.\n\nIn Etruria, the pseudo-red-figure style was not just a phenomenon of the earliest phases, as it had been in Attica. Especially during the 4th century, some workshops specialised in this technique, although true red-figure painting was widespread among Etrurian workshops at the same time. Notable workshops include the Sokra Group and the Phantom Group. The Sokra Group, somewhat older, preferred bowls with interior decoration of Greek mythical themes, but also some Etruscan motifs. The phantom Group mainly painted cloaked figures combined with vegetal or palmette ornamentation. The workshops of both groups are suspected to have been in Caere, Falerii and Tarquinia. The Phantom Group produced until the early 3rd century BC. Like elsewhere, the changing tastes of the customers eventually led to the end of this style.\n\nTrue red figure vase painting, i.e. vases where the red areas have been left unpainted, was introduced to Etruria near the end of the 5th century BC. The first workshops developed in Vulci and Falerii and produced also for the surrounding areas. It is likely that Attic masters were behind these early workshops, but a South Italian influence is evident, too. These workshops dominated the Etruscan market into the 4th century BC. Large and medium-sized vessels like \"kraters\" and jugs were decorated mostly with mythological scenes. In the course of the 4th century, the Falerian production began to eclipse that of Vulci. New centres of production developed in Chiusi and Orvieto. Especially the Tondo Group of Chiusi, producing mainly drinking vessels with interior depictions of dionysiac scenes, became important. During the second half of the century, Volterra became a main centre. Here, especially rod-handled \"kraters\" were produced and, especially in the early phases, painted elaborately.\n\nDuring the 2nd half of the 4th century BC, mythological themes disappeared from the repertoire of Etruscan painters. They were replaced by female heads and scenes of up to two figures. Instead of figural depictions, ornaments and floral motifs covered the vessel bodies. Large figural compositions, like that on a \"krater\" by the Den Haag Funnel Group Painter were only produced exceptionally. The originally large-scale production at Falerii lost its dominant role to the production centre at Caere, which had probably been founded by Falerian painters and cannot be said to represent a distinct tradition. The standard repertoire of the Caere workshops included simply painted \"oinochoai\", \"lekythoi\" and drinking bowls of the Torcop Group, and plates of the Genucuilia Group. The switch to the production of black glaze vases near the end of the 4th century, probably as a reaction to changing tastes of the time, spelt the end of Etrurian red-figure vase painting.\n\nAbout 65,000 red-figure vases and vase fragments are known to have survived. The study of ancient pottery and of Greek vase painting began already in the Middle Ages. Restoro d'Arezzo dedicated a chapter (\"Capitolo de le vasa antiche\") of his description of the world to ancient vases. He considered especially the clay vessels as perfect in terms of shape, colour, and artistic style. Nevertheless, initially the attention focused on vases in general, and perhaps especially on stone vases. The first collections of ancient vases, including some painted vessels, developed during the Renaissance. We even know of some imports from Greece to Italy at that time. Still, until the end of the Baroque period, vase painting was overshadowed by other genres, especially by sculpture. A rare pre-Classicist exception is a book of watercolours depicting figural vases, which was produced for Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc. Like some of his contemporary collectors, Peiresc owned a number of clay vases.\n\nSince the period of Classicism, ceramic vessels were collected more frequently. For example, Sir William Hamilton and Giuseppe Valletta had vase collections. Vases found in Italy were relatively affordable, so that even private individuals could assemble important collections. Vases were a popular souvenir for young northwestern Europeans to bring home from the Grand Tour. In the diaries of his voyageto Italy, Goethe refers to the temptation of buying ancient vases. Those who could not afford originals had the option of acquiring copies or prints. There were even manufactories specialised in imitating ancient pottery. The best known is Wedgwood ware, although it employed techniques entirely unrelated to those used in antiquity, using ancient motifs merely as a thematic inspiration.\n\nSince the 1760s, archaeological research also began to focus on vase paintings. The vases were appreciated as source material for all aspects of ancient life, especially for iconographical and mythological studies. Vase painting was now treated as a substitute for the almost entirely lost oeuvre of Greek monumental painting. Around this time, the widespread view that all painted vases were Etruscan works became untenable. Nonetheless, the artistic fashion of that time to imitate ancient vases came to be called \"all'etrusque\". England and France tried to outdo each other in terms of both research and imitation of vases. The German aesthetic writers Johann Heinrich Müntz and Johann Joachim Winckelmann studied vase paintings. Winckelmann especially praised the \"Umrißlinienstil\" (\"outline style\", i.e. red-figure painting). Vase ornaments were compiled and disseminated in England through \"Pattern books\".\n\nVase paintings even had an influence on the development of modern painting. The linear style influenced artists such as Edward Burne-Jones, Gustave Moreau or Gustav Klimt. Around 1840, Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller painted a \"Still Life with Silver Vessels and Red-Figure Bell Krater\". Henri Matisse produced a similar painting (\"Intérieur au vase étrusque\"). Their aesthetic influence extends into the present. For example, the well-known curved shape of the Coca-Cola bottle is inspired by Greek vases.\n\nThe scientific study of Attic vase paintings was advanced especially by John D. Beazley. Beazley began to study the vases from about 1910 onwards, inspired by the methodology that the art historian Giovanni Morelli had developed for the study of paintings. He assumed that each painter produced individual works that can always be unmistakably ascribed. To do so, particular details, such as faces, fingers, arms, legs, knees, garment folds and so on, were compared. Beazley examined 65,000 vases and fragments (of which 20,000 were black-figure). In the course of six decades of study, he was able to ascribe 17,000 of them to individual artists. Where their names remained unknown, he developed a system of conventional names. Beazley also united and combined individual painters into groups, workshops, schools and styles. No other archaeologist has ever had as formative an influence on a whole subdiscipline as had Beazley on the study of Greek vase painting. A large proportion of his analysis is still considered valid today. Beazley first published his conclusions on red-figure vase painting in 1925 and 1942. His initial studies only considered material from before the 4th century BC. For a new edition of his work published in 1963, he also incorporated that later period, making use of the work of other scholars, such as Karl Schefold, who had especially studied the Kerch Style vases. Famous scholars who continued the study of Attic red-figure after Beazley include John Boardman, Erika Simon and Dietrich von Bothmer.\n\nFor the study of South Italian case painting, Arthur Dale Trendall's work has a similar significance to that of Beazley for Attica. Most post-Beazley scholars can be said to follow Beazley's tradition and use his methodology. The study of Greek vases is ongoing, not least because of the constant addition of new material from archaeological excavations, illicit excavations and unknown private collections.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was built in 1867 and closed in 1966. The hall could accommodate between 800 and 900 persons, or up to 1,500 persons including the galleries. The architect was John Taylor of Whitehall.\n\nThe hall was known for three decades for its presentation of the German Reed Entertainments alongside other musical works and lectures. After 1895, it was used for vaudeville, drama, magic shows, as the headquarters of the London Academy of Music, and even as a skating rink. In 1933, it became a BBC broadcasting studio but was shut down after extensive damage from bombing in March 1943. The theatre was demolished in 1966, and the St Georges Hotel and Henry Wood House now stand on the site.\n\nThe hall was built as a concert hall for the New Philharmonic Society and opened on 24 April 1867. The Hall could be used as a theatre, however, and the first production at \"St. George's Theatre\" was \"A Woman's Whim\" by Walter Stephens on 3 December 1867.\n\nSoon afterwards, the theatre was leased by Thomas German Reed, who initially produced and conducted \"The Contrabandista\" (a comic opera by Arthur Sullivan and F. C. Burnand), \"The Beggar's Opera\" and other English operas in small-scale productions. In 1874, Reed's wife, Priscilla German Reed, moved the German Reed Entertainments to St. George's Hall. Like their earlier theatre, the Gallery of Illustration, St. George's had a small stage, and musical works were presented with only piano and harmonium. Thomas retired in 1871, and his son Alfred continued to run the theatre with his mother until her retirement in 1879 and, beginning in 1877, in partnership with Richard Corney Grain, until both their deaths in 1895.\n\nThe pieces premiered there included W. S. Gilbert's farce, \"A Medical Man\" (1872) and his one-act comic opera, \"Eyes and No Eyes\" (1875). John Baldwin Buckstone wrote \"Married Life\", and John Maddison Morton wrote \"Slasher and Crasher\" for the hall, both in 1872. In addition to performances, there were regular lectures in the hall, the Chartist Gerald Massey gave a series of lectures in 1872, on \"Christianity and Spiritualism\". The theist Charles Voysey gave regular Sunday sermons from 1875, after his ejection from the established church. H. G. Wells described a visit to one tedious Sunday lecture in \"Incidental Thoughts on a Bald Head\". When they were not presenting a piece at the hall, it was rented it out to amateurs or other entertainments.\nAt the hall Gilbert Arthur à Beckett presented \"Two Foster Brothers\", composed by Alfred Cellier (1877), and \"Once in a Century\", with music by Vivian Bligh. Henry Pottinger Stephens wrote his first burlesque, \"Back from India\" for the hall in 1879, as well as \"Hobbies\" in 1885, with William Yardley and music by George Gear. \"Cherry Tree Farm\" and \"All at Sea\" played in 1881. The same year, William Poel produced his \"Hamlet\". In the early 1880s, Eric Lewis sometimes substituted at the Hall for Corney Grain. Herbert Gardiner wrote \"A Night in Wales\" (1885) for the hall with music by Corney Grain. Alfred J. Caldicott wrote a number of pieces for the hall, including \"A Treasure Trove\", \"A Moss Rose Rent\" (1883), \"Old Knockles\" (1884), \"In Cupid's Court\" (1885), \"The Friar\" (1886), \"Tally Ho\" (1887), \"Wanted, An Heir and The Boson's Mate\" (1888), \"John Smith\" (1889), \"The Old Bureau\" (1891), and \"An Old Pair\" (1893).\n\nFanny Holland starred in many of the entertainments, along with Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, their son Alfred, Holland's husband Arthur Law, Corney Grain, Arthur Cecil (all of whom also wrote for the hall) Carlotta Carrington and Leonora Braham, who made her professional stage debut in 1870 at the hall in a revival of Gilbert and Clay's \"Ages Ago\", which was revived again there in 1874. Except for a brief stint at the Criterion Theatre in 1874 and at the Savoy Theatre in 1879-80, Holland starred at St. George's until 1895 in entertainments too numerous to name. Many of the entertainments were written by Law, including \"A Night Surprise\" (1877), \"Nobody's Fault\", composed by Hamilton Clarke (1882), and \"A Happy Bungalow\", with music by Charles King Hall. Other pieces from the 1870s starring Holland included \"Number 204\" by F. C. Burnand, with music by Thomas German Reed; and \"Our New Doll’s House\" by W. Wye, with music by Cotsford Dick.\n\nAfter the German Reed Entertainments closed in 1895, the building changed its name to the Matinee Theatre, on 17 April 1897, presenting \"high class vaudeville,\" but it was not very successful. A series of German plays were then produced, but in 1904 the hall closed.\n\nIn 1905, magician John Nevil Maskelyne renovated, expanded and reopened the 'St George's Hall, England's New Home of Mystery,' on 24 January 1905 with \"The Coming Race\" by David Christie Murray and Maskelyne. Maskelyne's entertainments were called \"Maskelyne's Theatre of Mystery.\" The theatre also hosted meetings of The Magic Circle, an association of amateur and professional magicians, and its members David Devant and Maskelyne continued to give magic shows for many years. One was called \"Maskelyne and Devant's Mysteries\", which was presented in August 1910.\n\nThe hall was also used as a \"Bioscope Picture Palace\", although with a reduced capacity of 500. The building also was used as the headquarters of the London Academy of Music. The hall was later converted to use as a skating rink.\n\nSt. George's was finally acquired by Eric Maschwitz for the BBC in 1933 for broadcasts of vaudeville, comedy and revue shows, and opened as a studio on 25 November 1933. The BBC installed the original \"BBC Theatre Organ\" in 1936, a \"Compton Melotone and Electrostatic Organ\", this enabled a wide range of sounds to be produced during performances. Reginald Foort was appointed resident organist. The hall sustained extensive damage from bombing in March 1943, during World War II, and the studios moved to the Aeolian Hall, in New Bond Street.\n\nThe building was demolished in 1966, and together with the site of the adjacent Queens Hall – original home of the Henry Wood promenade concerts – the location was used for the construction of the St Georges Hotel and Henry Wood House.\n\n"}

The pattern is created on the printing plate either in engraving by gouging out the dots with a burin, or through an etching process. Stippling was used as an adjunct to conventional line engraving and etching for over two centuries, before being developed as a distinct technique in the mid-18th century.\n\nThe technique allows for subtle tonal variations and is especially suitable for reproducing chalk drawings.\n\nStipple effects were used in conjunction with other engraving techniques by artists as early as Giulio Campagnola (c.1482 – c. 1515) and Ottavio Leoni (1578 – 1630), although some of Campagnola's small prints were almost entirely in stipple. In Holland in the seventeenth century, the printmaker and goldsmith Jan Lutma developed an engraving technique, known as \"opus mallei\", in which the dots are punched into the plate by an awl struck with a hammer, while in England the faces of portraits were engraved with stippled dots by William Rogers in the sixteenth century and Lucas Vorsterman in the seventeenth.\n\nAn etched stipple technique known as the crayon manner, suitable for producing imitations of chalk drawings, was pioneered in France. Gilles Demarteau used in 1756 goldsmith's chasing tools and marking-wheels to shade the lines in a series of \"Trophies\" designed by Antoine Watteau. Jean-Charles François who was a partner of Demarteau further developed the technique and used it to engrave the whole plate. François engraved in 1757 three etchings directly on copper in crayon manner. He then used the technique to etch three plates using different-size needles bound together. Other people who contributed to this new engraving technique included Alexis Magny and Jean-Baptiste Delafosse. William Wynne Ryland, who had worked with Jean-Charles François, took the crayon manner to Britain, using it in his contributions to Charles Roger’s publication \"A Collection of Prints in imitation of Drawings\", and developing it further under the name of \"stipple engraving\".\n\nThe process of stipple engraving is described in T.H. Fielding's \"Art of Engraving\" (1841). To begin with an etching ground is laid on the plate. The outline is drawn out in small dots with an etching needle, and the darker areas of the image shaded with a pattern of close dots. As in mezzotint use was made of \"roulettes\", and a \"mattoir\" to produce large numbers of dots relatively quickly. Then the plate is bitten with acid, and the etching ground removed. The lighter areas of shade are then laid in with a drypoint or a stipple graver; Fielding describes the latter as \"resembling the common kind, except that the blade bends down instead of up, thereby allowing the engraver greater facility in forming the small holes or dots in the copper\". The etched middle and dark tones would also be deepened where appropriate with the graver.\n\nIn France the technique fed a fashion for reproductions of red chalk drawings by artists such as Antoine Watteau and François Boucher. Gilles Demarteau etched 266 drawings of Boucher in stipple, for printing in an appropriate sanguine-coloured ink and framing. These prints so resembled red chalk drawings that they could be framed as little pictures. They could then be hung in the small blank spaces of the elaborately decorated paneling of residences.\nIn England the technique was used for \"furniture prints\" with a similar purpose, and became very popular, though regarded with disdain by producers of the portrait mezzotints that dominated the English portrait print market. Stipple competed with mezzotint as a tonal method of printmaking, and while it lacked the rich depth of tone of mezzotint, it had the great advantage that far more impressions could be taken from a plate.\n\nDuring the late eighteenth century, some printmakers, including Francesco Bartolozzi, began to use colour in stipple engraving. Rather than using separate plates for each colour, as in most colour printing processes of the time, such as Jacob Christoph Le Blon's three-colour mezzotint method, the different colours were carefully applied with a brush to a single plate for each impression, a highly skilled operation which soon proved economically unviable. This method is also known as \"à la poupée\" after the French term for the small cotton pads used for the inking.\n"}

It was later reprinted in the “Medical Essays” in 1855. It is included as Volume 38, Part 5 of the Harvard Classics series. \n\nIn just under 12,000 words Holmes argues forcefully and convincingly that the rampant infection killing women within a few days of childbirth was caused mainly through infection spread by their birth attendants. He also laid down well-thought out and easy to execute behaviors through which the spread of infection could be contained.\n\nHolmes developed an interest in puerperal fever by accident. In 1836 Holmes graduated from Harvard Medical School. He was Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Dartmouth College from 1838 to 1840. In 1840 Holmes went back to Boston, took up general practice, and joined the Boston Society for Medical Improvement. At one of the meetings of the Society a report was presented about a physician who had performed a post mortem examination of a woman who had died from puerperal fever. Within a week that doctor himself died of infection, seemingly contracted when he was wounded during the autopsy he had conducted on the dead woman. The report stated that during the time interval between when the physician received the wound and then subsequently died from it, all the women whom he had attended during childbirth contracted puerperal fever. This report seems to have convinced Holmes that\n“The disease, known as Puerperal Fever, is so far contagious as to be frequently carried from patient to patient by physicians and nurses.”\nThe end of the essay included eight steps which birth attendants needed to adhere to in order to prevent the spread of infection from patient to patient, especially infected patients to susceptible women after childbirth. Until this time in history these eight rules were the most definitive standard so far published on the control of this terrifying illness. Adhering to these protocols no doubt saved innumerable lives around the world.\nUnfortunately the essay did not enjoy the early and wide distribution which it deserved. The essay first came to light as a paper read before the Boston Society for Medical Improvement. The Society asked that the essay be published as a paper in the New England Quarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery in April 1843. Due to low circulation of this specialized journal and the fact that the journal was discontinued after just one year, the paper was not properly brought to the attention of either physicians or the public at large.\nIn 1852 Dr. James Copeland mentioned the Holmes essay positively in his well-respected Dictionary of Practical Medicine. Dr. Copeland, who was the Consulting Physician to Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital in London, affirmed the contagiousness of puerperal fever by pointing out that \"Dr. Holmes has forcibly and eloquently brought this much neglected subject before the profession.\" Dr. Copeland unfortunately also added that there was no consensus on the infectiousness of puerperal fever with such eminent experts as Hulme, Leake, Hull, Beaudeloque, Tonnellé, Dugé, Dewees and others still denying this fact.\nTwelve years after the original publication in 1843 Holmes reprinted his essay in 1855 as a private publication. He entitled it “Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence.” He had two main reasons for the reprint: first, because of the poor distribution of the essay at first; and second, to warn his fellow doctors and convince them of the contagiousness of puerperal fever. Holmes added a preface to the original essay, stating all the issues, deflating the pretensions of the professors who were still denying the cause of the fever, and warning medical students of the illogical nature of their arguments.\n"}

Since the second edition published in 1819, it has been recorded as Tale no. 112.\nIt is Aarne–Thompson type AT 1889K, \"A Rope Made of Chaff\".\n\nThe tale begins with a peasant tilling his fields with a pair of oxen. Inexplicably, while in the field, the oxen's horns grew to an extraordinary size; an effect that prevented the peasant from returning home with them. Fortunately, the peasant was able to sell the oxen to a nearby butcher. The butcher, having no currency on him, bartered a measure of turnip-seed with the peasant, offering should the peasant return to him with the measure of rapeseed he would exchange a Brabant thaler for each seed. The peasant returned home with the seed, however, he lost one seed out of the bag on the way. The next day, the butcher paid him per agreement minus the one missing seed. On his way back from the butcher, the peasant passed where he dropped the seed and saw it had sprouted into a tree which reached up to the heavens. The peasant climbed the tree and, reaching the top, spied angels threshing oats. While he was viewing the angels, the tree began to shake; someone below was cutting down the tree. To save himself from being falling from the tree, the peasant wove a length of rope from the oat chaff that lay in piles. Before descending he stole a hoe and a flail which were lying in the heavenly fields. He descended the rope only to find himself at the bottom of deep pit. Using the hoe, he carved a flight of steps and walked up and out of the pit. The peasant kept the flail as proof of his adventure.\n\n"}

We don't get paid for working with our feet — we get paid for working with our heads\". Watson then wrote THINK on the easel.\n\nAsked later what he meant by the slogan, Watson replied, \"By THINK I mean take everything into consideration. I refuse to make the sign more specific.

{"id": "286621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286621", "title": "Web colors", "text": "Web colors\n\nWeb colors are colors used in displaying web pages, and the methods for describing and specifying those colors. Colors may be specified as an RGB triplet or in hexadecimal format (a \"hex triplet\") or according to their common English names in some cases. A color tool or other graphics software is often used to generate color values. In some uses, hexadecimal color codes are specified with notation using a leading number sign (#). A color is specified according to the intensity of its red, green and blue components, each represented by eight bits. Thus, there are 24 bits used to specify a web color within the sRGB gamut, and 16,777,216 colors that may be so specified.\n\nColors outside the sRGB gamut can be specified in Cascading Style Sheets by making one or more of the red, green and blue components negative or greater than 100%, so the color space is theoretically an unbounded extrapolation of sRGB similar to scRGB. Specifying a non-sRGB color this way requires the RGB() function call; it is impossible with the hexadecimal syntax (and thus impossible in legacy HTML documents that do not use CSS).\n\nThe first versions of Mosaic and Netscape Navigator used the X11 color names as the basis for their color lists, as both started as X Window System applications.\nWeb colors have an unambiguous colorimetric definition, sRGB, which relates the chromaticities of a particular phosphor set, a given transfer curve, adaptive whitepoint, and viewing conditions. These have been chosen to be similar to many real-world monitors and viewing conditions, in order to allow rendering to be fairly close to the specified values even without color management. User agents vary in the fidelity with which they represent the specified colors. More advanced user agents use color management to provide better color fidelity; this is particularly important for Web-to-print applications.\n\nA hex triplet is a six-digit, three-byte hexadecimal number used in HTML, CSS, SVG, and other computing applications to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green and blue components of the color. One byte represents a number in the range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. Thus web colors specify colors in the True Color (24-bit RGB) color scheme. The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order:\nFor example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 (a grayish-blue color). The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers 24, 68 and A0 respectively. The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the six hexadecimal digits together, 2468A0 in this example.\n\nIf any one of the three color values is less than 10 hex (16 decimal), it must be represented with a leading zero so that the triplet always has exactly six digits. For example, the decimal triplet 4, 8, 16 would be represented by the hex digits 04, 08, 10, forming the hex triplet 040810.\n\nThe number of colors that can be represented by this system is 16 or 256 or 2 = 16,777,216.\n\nAn abbreviated, three (hexadecimal)-digit form is used. Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC as presented on the following CSS example:\n\nThis shorthand form reduces the palette to 4,096 colors, equivalent of 12-bit color as opposed to 24-bit color using the whole six-digit form (16,777,216 colors), this limitation is sufficient for many text based documents.\n\nRGB values are usually given in the 0–255 range; if they are in the 0–1 range, the values are multiplied by 255 before conversion. This number divided by sixteen (integer division; ignoring any remainder) gives us the first hexadecimal digit (between 0 and F, where the letters A to F represent the numbers 10 to 15. See hexadecimal for more details). The remainder gives us the second hexadecimal digit. For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C. A remainder of nine gives us the hexadecimal number C9. This process is repeated for each of the three color values.\n\nConversion between number bases is a common feature of calculators, including both hand-held models and the software calculators bundled with most modern operating systems. Web-based tools specifically for converting color values are also available.\n\nThe HTML 4.01 specification, ratified in 1999, defines 16 named colors, as follows (names are defined in this context to be case-insensitive):\nThese 16 were labelled as sRGB and included in the HTML 3.0 specification, which noted they were \"the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows VGA palette.\"\n\nA number of colors are defined by web browsers. A particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005, all modern, general-use, graphical browsers support the full list of colors. Many of these colors are from the list of X11 color names distributed with the X Window System. These colors were standardized by SVG 1.0, and are accepted by SVG Full user agents. They are not part of SVG Tiny.\n\nThe list of colors shipped with the X11 product varies between implementations and clashes with certain of the HTML names such as green. X11 colors are defined as simple RGB (hence, no particular color space), rather than sRGB. This means that the list of colors found in X11 (e.g., in /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt) should not directly be used to choose colors for the web.\n\nThe list of web \"X11 colors\" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below. Compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards. This includes the common synonyms: aqua (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name) and cyan (common sRGB name), magenta (common sRGB name) and fuchsia (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name), gray (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name) and grey.\n\nIn the mid-90s, many displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors. These may be dictated by the hardware or changeable by a \"color table\". When a color is found (e.g., in an image) that is not one available, a different one had to be used. This can be done by either using the closest color, or by using dithering.\n\nThere were various attempts to make a \"standard\" color palette. A set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six equally spaced shades of red, green, and blue (6 × 6 × 6 = 216), each from 00 to FF (including both limits).\n\nThe list of colors is presented as if it had special properties that render them immune to dithering, but on 256-color displays applications can actually set a palette of any selection of colors that they choose, dithering the rest. These colors were chosen specifically because they matched the palettes selected by various browser applications. There were not very different palettes in use in different browsers.\n\n\"Web-safe\" colors had a flaw in that, on systems such as X11 where the palette is shared between applications, smaller color cubes (5×5×5 or 4×4×4) were allocated by browsers—the \"web safe\" colors would dither on such systems. Different results were obtained by providing an image with a larger range of colors and allowing the browser to quantize the color space if needed, rather than suffer the quality loss of a double quantization.\n\n, personal computers typically have 24-bit (TrueColor) and the use of \"web-safe\" colors has fallen into practical disuse.\n\nThe \"web-safe\" colors do not all have standard names, but each can be specified by an RGB triplet: each component (red, green, and blue) takes one of the six values from the following table (out of the 256 possible values available for each component in full 24-bit color).\n\nThe following table shows all of the \"web-safe\" colors. One shortcoming of the web-safe palette is its small range of light colors for webpage backgrounds, whereas the intensities at the low end of the range, such as the two darkest, are similar to each other, making them hard to distinguish.\n\nDesigners were encouraged to stick to these 216 \"web-safe\" colors in their websites because there were a lot of 8-bit color displays when the 216-color palette was developed. David Lehn and Hadley Stern discovered that only 22 of the 216 colors in the web-safe palette are reliably displayed without inconsistent remapping on 16-bit computer displays. They called these 22 colors the \"really safe\" palette; it consists largely of shades of green, yellow, and blue, as can be seen in the table below.\n\nThe Cascading Style Sheets specification defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 html colors, and 124 colors from the Netscape X11 color list for a total of 140 names that were recognized by Internet Explorer (IE) 3.0 and Netscape Navigator 3.0. Blooberry.com notes that Opera 2.1 and Safari 1 also included Netscape's expanded list of 140 color names, but later discovered 14 names not included with Opera 3.5 on Windows 98.\n\nIn CSS 2.1, the color 'orange' (one of the 140) was added to the section with the 16 HTML4 colors as a 17th color. The CSS3.0 specification did not include \"orange\" in the \"HTML4 color keywords\" section, which was renamed as \"Basic color keywords\". In the same reference, the \"SVG color keywords\" section, was renamed \"Extended color keywords\", after starting out as \"X11 color keywords\" in an earlier working draft. The working draft for the CSS4 color module combines the Basic and Extended sections together in a simple \"Named Colors\" section.\n\nCSS 2, SVG and CSS 2.1 allow web authors to use \"system colors\", which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system, picking the operating system's highlighted text color, or the background color for tooltip controls. This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent. The CSS3 color module has deprecated the use of system colors in favor of CSS3 UI System Appearance property, which itself was subsequently dropped from CSS3.\n\nThe developing CSS3 specification also introduces HSL color space values to style sheets:\nOn 21 June 2014, the CSS WG added the color RebeccaPurple to the Editor's Draft of the CSS4 Colors module, to commemorate Eric Meyer's daughter Rebecca who died on 7 June 2014, her sixth birthday.\n\nSome browsers and devices do not support colors. For these displays, or for blind and colorblind users, Web content depending on colors can be unusable or difficult to use.\n\nEither no colors should be specified (to invoke the browser's default colors), or both the background and all foreground colors (such as the colors of plain text, unvisited links, hovered links, active links, and visited links) should be specified to avoid black on black or white on white effects.\n\n"}
