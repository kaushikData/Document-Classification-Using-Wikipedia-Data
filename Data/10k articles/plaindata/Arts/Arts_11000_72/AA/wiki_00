{"id": "44666850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44666850", "title": "A Dialogue of Comfort against Tribulation", "text": "A Dialogue of Comfort against Tribulation\n\nA Dialogue of Comfort against Tribulation is a work that was written by St. Thomas More while imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1534.\n\nThomas More was imprisoned by King Henry VIII for refusing to swear to the Act of Succession (1534). He had been given writing materials in the early months of his imprisonment.\n\nThe Dialogue is set in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1528, between the invasions of Suleiman the Magnificent. It is a fictional dialogue between Vincent and his uncle, Anthony. The book begins with Vincent paying a visit to his uncle. He is terrified by the invasions of the Ottomans and seeks comfort from Anthony. Anthony tells him that comfort can only come from God. The Dialogue is a reflection on worldly power, the transience of pleasure, and the redemptive power of Jesus Christ. While it is a spiritual reflection, the treatment of themes of worldly power by a major political figure and humanist also characterizes it as a work of political thought.\n\nBook I (Day 1)\n\n\"Comfort in Tribulation (Chapters I-XII)\"\n\nAnthony defines tribulation as grief consisting either of bodily pain or heaviness of the mind. Ancient moral philosophers recommended various remedies for tribulation, including the uses of certain drugs, but they lacked the most effective source of comfort, faith, which is a gift from God (I-II).\n\nThe first source of comfort in tribulation is the desire to be comforted by God (III). But, the desire to have tribulation taken away is not always sufficient, since God sometimes wills for us to suffer tribulation (IV). Anthony discusses the importance of friends who pray for and give counsel to the one suffering tribulation (V). Comfort in tribulation requires trust that God works all things towards good (VI).\n\nThe second source of comfort is that tribulation is medicinal (VII).\nAnthony says there are three types of tribulation: \n\nThird source of comfort is that merit can be gained through perseverance here on Earth but not in purgatory (XI). This perseverance leads not only to the purging of our sins, but also to the increase of our heavenly reward. Anthony questions the existence of purgatory (XII).\n\n\"The Necessity of Tribulation (Chapters XIII-XX)\"\n\nFourth source of comfort is that the cross is necessary to enter heaven and continual prosperity is a grave danger (XIII). Vincent responds that this treatment of prosperity is too harsh (XIV) and raises four objections (XV):\nAnthony defines tribulation again and answers first and third objections (XVI). Then, Anthony answers the second objection and explains how suffering draws us to God, through prayer (XVII). Anthony speaks of those who seek “mad medicines” rather than God (XVIII). Vincent questions the preeminence Anthony gives to suffering. Anthony argues that the prayers of those suffering are far more precious to God than the prayers of the prosperous (XIX). Anthony explains that suffering is a gracious gift from God. Anthony speaks about the necessity of tribulation. He claims that continual prosperity without tribulation is a sign of God’s disfavor (XX).\n\nBook II (about a month later, after breakfast)\n\nVincent returns to visit Anthony and tells him that he has shared his council with his friends and that he wishes to hear more. The main topic of their last discussion was not tribulation itself but the comfort that comes from it (prologue). Vincent says that Anthony disavowal of all worldly recreation is too hard. Anthony responds that while it is allowed to seek worldly enjoyment our first priority should be to seek comfort from God (I). Anthony bemoans how old and frail he is (II). Anthony divides tribulation into three types: \nThe third kind was discussed in the first book and Anthony reiterates his principle that wit and faith are necessary for comfort in this type of tribulation (III). Anthony describes the first type where the tribulation is willfully accepted for penance and no comfort is needed. To show that two contrary states can co-exist, he gives an example of a strange intermittent fever he had where he felt both cold and hot (IV). Vincent says many people refrain from repenting until their deathbeds. Anthony answers saying deathbed conversions are still salvific but those who live lives of repentance have a higher place in heaven (V). Vincent adds that some say compunction and penance for one's sins is unnecessary or ineffectual and that only the intent to do better is required. Anthony responds, the Church has always taught that it is only through Christ’s Passion that our penance is worth anything. And Anthony gives many scriptural examples of how fasting was instituted by God, not by men and for more reasons than to increase physical temperance (VI). Vincent asks, what if one cannot feel sorry for one’s sins. Anthony answers that if he cannot feel sorry for his sin, then at least he should feel sorry for not feeling sorry (VII).\n\nAnthony discusses the second type of tribulation, those willingly suffered, and he subdivides them into two parts: the first being temptation and the second persecution (VIII).\n\n\"Psalm 91 [90]:5-6 and the First Temptation (Chapter IX-XVI)\"\n\nContinuing the discussion on temptation, Anthony says that the forms of temptation are diverse and the more we are tempted the more reason we have to be comforted in the hope of receiving an eternal reward (IX). The second comfort in temptation is that God has promised to give us the necessary strength and wisdom to overcome temptation if we ask for it. He introduces Psalm 91 [90] where God is described as a hen which protects her young with her wings (X).\n\nAnthony distinguishes four types of temptation in the Psalm (XI). The first is about fear which leads to impatience or to the exaggeration of danger. Anthony uses verse five from the Psalm ‘Thou shalt not be afeard of the fear of the night’ as a basis for his interpretation (XII). Another form of ‘night’s fear’ is pusillanimity, which is fleeing from things that are incorrectly perceived as dangerous (XIII). Anthony describes a scrupulous conscience as the “daughter of pusillanimity” and advises those with scruples to seek another’s counsel (XIV). Anthony continues by saying the desire to commit suicide is another example of ‘night’s fear’. Vincent objects and says that suicide is an example of courage and boldness. Anthony responds by telling him that people can be tempted to commit suicide out of pride or anger and therefore do not suffer tribulation and are not in need of comfort but rather good counsel (XV). Anthony discusses the desire to kill oneself that is perceived to be a revelation from God. In such cases comfort and counsel are both required; counsel is necessary to make him aware of his delusion and comfort is necessary to encourage him and give him consolation (XVI).\n\n\"The Second Temptation (Chapter XVI)\"\n\nAnthony defines the second temptation as pride. He interprets \"the arrow flying by day\" (Psalm 91 [90]:5b) to consist of temptations that find their source in prosperity (XVI).\n\n\"The Third Temptation (Chapter XVII)\"\n\nAnthony identifies the third temptation as covetousness. He interprets Psalm 91 [90]:6 “the busyness walking about in the darknesses” to be the frantic pursuit of riches or worldly possessions. Vincent asks if the rich man can be saved. Anthony explains that riches in themselves are not evil only the inordinate pursuit of them. Wealth should be used to care for the poor, one’s family (including servants), and strangers in need (XVII).\n\nBook III (later on the same day, after dinner)\nVincent tells Anthony about a letter he saw from Constantinople concerning the approaching Turkish army. Vincent expresses his fear that the Turks will invade Hungary and that many Christians will renounce their faith. Anthony agrees that this will probably happen. He says that Turkish invasion is God’s punishment on Europe for their lack of faith. Anthony says that since the various warring factions for the Hungarian throne will not offer much resistance against the Turkish invasion, they should prepare for the worst (Prologue).\n\nVincent objects saying it is dangerous to think about how one would respond under torture, either you will promise too much beforehand and fail to persevere or you will want to avoid pain and give up your faith. Anthony responds that Christians must confess their faith openly upon pain of damnation. If anyone is afraid of falling, let them think of Christ's Passion and pray for strength (I).\n\n\"The Fourth Temptation (Chapters II-IV)\"\n\nThe fourth, and final temptation, is open persecution for the faith. Anthony interprets Psalm 91 [90]:6b \"incursion of the noon-day devil\" to be the most dangerous of all temptations. Here the Devil works openly and without subterfuge. Vincent would like to be prepared to withstand the attacks of the Devil with good counsel (II).\n\nAnthony states that both the soul and the body can suffer harm. Anthony asks Vincent to list the outward things that a man might lose and the pain he might suffer. Vincent first lists the loss of worldly possessions, offices, positions of authority and finally the lands that belong to the man in question and his heirs. The loss of these things leads to neediness and poverty, and the shame of begging. The harm that comes to the body consists of loss of liberty, hard labor, imprisonment, and a painful and shameful death (III). Anthony admits that after examining the issue as they have, the threat of the Turkish invasion seems less terrible (IV).\n\n\"The Loss of Outward Things (Chapters V-XVI)\"\n\nAnthony states that the value of outward goods is greatly exaggerated; they can be lost easily (V). The possession of land does not offer any more security than other forms of wealth (VI). The outward ‘goods of fortune’ and one’s reputation should be used to benefit one's earthly life and increase merit, “with God’s help”, in the afterlife (VII). There is a limited value of being wealthy in this life (VIII).\n\nAnthony considers fame or one’s good name. Its value is also exaggerated and can even be harmful, especially when people hate or envy us (IX). Some men prefer flattery over honesty so much they hire flatterers as advisors. Vincent tells a story about a prelate who asked an ambassador for advice and afterwards rebuked him for his honesty. Anthony responds with a story about King Ladislaus I of Hungary, who if he was honestly and deservedly praised, would let it pass unremarked, but if he received flattery he would tell the flatterer to not praise him with lies (X).\n\nAnthony explains that positions of authority are of little value if they are only desired for worldly advantage. Most men only want positions of power so that they can order people around. Vincent interjects that there is still a certain pleasure in making people bow and do reverence. Anthony replies that even princes cannot always have their way and their responsibilities are more burdensome (XI). Outward goods, when desired only for worldly advantage, have little value for the body and can cause great harm for the soul (XII). Anthony points out that in the imminent Turkish persecutions those who have a greater desire to keep their possessions than faith will keep their worldly goods and those who have a stronger faith than the desire to keep their possessions will loses their worldly goods (XIII). Vincent acknowledges that the temptation to give up one's faith to keep one’s worldly possessions is the strongest of all temptations. Anthony has Vincent play the role of a great lord who wants to keep his possessions. Vincent, as the lord, says he can outwardly confess the Great Turk’s faith while secretly remaining a Christian. Anthony responds that God is not fooled and neither will the Great Turk. You cannot serve both God and Mammon. He also points out that even if one denies the faith that is no guarantee one will be able to keep one’s property (XIV).\n\nVincent points out that it is always detestable to lose one’s possessions. Anthony suggests that the only safe place to hide one’s treasure is in heaven, that is to give one's possessions to the poor. If our hearts are truly in Heaven, God will strengthen us to suffer the loss of our worldly possessions (XV). Christians have grown very weak and lukewarm in their faith. Yet, if they truly remembered the poverty of Christ, how he became poor and needy for their sake, they would be ashamed to forsake him by keeping their wealth. If we lose our possessions because of our faith we will be recompensed in heaven (XVI).\n\n\"Bodily Pain, Captivity, and Imprisonment (Chapters XVII-XXII)\"\n\nVincent tells Anthony of his fear of denying the faith under torture. Anthony responds by reminding Vincent that Christ dreaded his own Passion. Vincent is comforted by Anthony's words (XVII). Anthony lists the physical punishments common in the persecution by the Turks: captivity, imprisonment, and painful death. Anthony defines captivity as the violent restraint of a man under the power of another to the extent that he must do what the other commands, and is not at liberty to go where he wishes. Christ’s humility is offered as a model to follow (XVIII).\n\nAnthony defines imprisonment as: a restraint of liberty that prevents a man from going where he wishes. Anthony states that every man is in a prison. Vincent objects accusing his uncle of “sophistical fantasies”. Anthony welcomes Vincent’s challenge and replies that every man coming into this world is condemned to death by God's own judgement for man's original sin. No one, not even the greatest king, can escape the grisly cruel hangman Death (XIX).\n\nAnthony describes God is the chief jailer of this prison of the whole earth. Vincent accepts part of Anthony's argument, but objects that he does not see God putting any man in stocks or fetters, or locking him in a chamber. Anthony replies that as God himself is invisible, he also uses invisible instruments to inflict his punishments. If we fear imprisonment at the hands of the Turks so much that we are prepared to renounce our faith, then we will find ourselves thrown into the prison of Hell, from which no man ever escapes (XX).\n\nVincent expresses fear of suffering a shameful and painful death. Anthony explains that if our affections are sensual we will fear death much more than if they are spiritual (XXI). Anthony considers death itself (XXII).\n\n\"Persecution and Martyrdom (Chapters XXIII-XXVII)\"\n\nAnthony discusses the shame that comes with persecution. Anthony then argues that the faithful wise man will not dread any death however painful since Christ himself and his saints died such glorious deaths (XXIII). Vincent responds that shame is one thing that can be mastered, but no one can master pain in the same way. Anthony replies that, though no one can deny the reality of pain, reason alone often helps a man to bear the pain for the sake of some greater good (XXIV).\n\nAnthony says that Christ warns us not to fear those who can only kill the body, but rather to fear the one who can kill both body and soul in Hell. Anyone who considers this will not be afraid to endure the most terrible sufferings the Turks can inflict, rather than be cast into the pains of Hell (XXV). Anthony discusses the joys of Heaven. He says, if we considered the joys of Heaven, we would be much more willing to suffer for Christ in this world for the sake of winning heavenly joy (XXVI).\n\nFinally, Anthony describes in detail the sufferings of Christ in his Passion, and suggests that, if we meditate on them, they will inflame our cold hearts with such love for Christ, that we will be happy to suffer death for his sake. We should prepare ourselves with prayer, fasting and almsgiving, and not trust in our own strength, but rely on the help of God. We should resist the Devil's temptations, and not fear the Turks (XXVII).\n\n\"Conclusion\"\n\nAnthony, wearily, bids Vincent farewell. Vincent thanks Anthony for all his efforts and the comfort Vincent has taken from Anthony's counsels. Vincent says he will write down what was discussed in Hungarian and German. Anthony ends by praying that God will breathe His Holy Spirit into the reader's breast, so that he may teach the reader inwardly in his heart. Anthony then prays that God will reunite them once more either here or in Heaven(XXVII).\n\nThere are three main interpretations of the Great Turk in the Dialogue.\n\nIn a literal interpretation, the Great Turk signifies the terrible vulnerability of a theologically and politically divided Europe to the Turkish invasions. As Hungary was on the eastern edge of Europe, it was the first line of defense in preventing the Ottomans from conquering the rest Europe. And since the Emperor took an oath (Book III) when he becomes Sultan to spread the faith of Islam by conquest, the threat of persecution or martyrdom for Christians was real.\n\nHenry VIII was directly responsible for Thomas More’s tribulation when he wrote the Dialogue in the tower. But the King’s legacy can be extended to all Roman Catholics in England. The separation of England from the Roman Catholic Church during the English Reformation made Catholicism illegal and began centuries of persecution. Catholics were not granted legal toleration in England until 1829 under the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 and there is still a very deep rooted tradition of Anti-Catholicism today in English speaking countries including the USA.\n\nThe Devil is ultimately the cause of all the trials and persecutions that Christians may be called upon to suffer in this life, especially in light of the first and second interpretations. In the Dialogue, Thomas More continually emphasizes the importance of a strong faith and prayer to overcome the Devil and his works.\n\nImmediately after More's death the Dialogue of Comfort circulated in manuscript form. The most important surviving manuscripts are the Corpus Christi Manuscript, Bodleian Library, Ms. C.C.C. D.37;and British Library, Ms. Royal 17 D.XIV. It was first published, in quarto, in London by Richard Tottel in 1553. In modern editions the spelling and punctuation of the original are corrected and standardized.\n\n\n\n\"A Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation\", 1847 Edition:\n1557 complete works edition\n\n\n\n"}

This \"abhimāna\" or identification with names and forms dependent on the perishable body, as also with the subtle body, needs to be given up entirely in order to realize \"akhanda ānanda\" (inseparable bliss). Vācaspati Miśra explains that it is \"ahamkāra\" (empirical ego) which presides over the objects intuited by the sense-organs and then definitely perceived by the mind; and that the sense-organ intuits the object, \"manas\" reflects on it, \"ahamkāra\" appropriates it and finally \"buddhi\" (intellect) resolves which way the intended action must proceed.\n\n\"Abhimāna\" is the false sense of \"I\" and \"mine\"; it is because of the emphatic identity (\"abhimāna\") with one’s body etc., that there is \"pramata\" (cognising subject) and involvement with \"pramānas\" (acts or processes of knowing, perception, inference and the rest) owing to functioning of the senses as resulting from \"avidyā\" (ignorance) and resulting in bondage. Examined from the level of social consciousness, ātman or the transcendental consciousness is certainly essential for man’s being but \"upadhis\" (limitations) are its accidental parts the self-identification with which gives rise to \"abhimāna\" (identification with the body) that makes man a socio-spiritual being subjective and objective, both, and becomes the basis for his \"adhikāra\" (social and ritual eligibility). According to the Shudha Advaita school of Vallabha Acharya, \"saguna\" means – one having the \"abhimāna\" of gunas (forming part of one’s own self), the \"nirguna\" is one having no abhimāna.\n\nThe Lakshmi Tantra tells us that \"\"ahamkāra\" which is a cognitive-sense, is identical with \"abhimāna\"\" and \"the awareness of the knower in relating time and place to himself is called \"abhimāna\"\". For most people desiring success, incidental gains and weighed down by sense of self-respect \"abhimāna\" is a virtue but for those who are wise and contented, it is mere pride associated with arrogance.\nBhoja, who outlined the theory of Rasa (experience of delight), attaches great importance to \"abhimāna\" or \"ahankāra\" (ego). He states that the \"rasika\" who has \"rasa\" in him has it because of \"sringara\" (peak), \"ahamkāra\" and \"abhimāna\", enjoyable as a \"guna\" of his atman; he uses the term \"abhimāna\" in a good sense. From \"ahamkāra\" rises \"abhimāna\" that originates \"sringāra\", and from \"abhimāna\" rises \"rati\" (love, amorousness), and from \"rati\" are originated all \"rasas\".\n"}

{"id": "1080319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1080319", "title": "Airport novel", "text": "Airport novel\n\nAirport novel(s) represent a literary genre that is not so much defined by its plot or cast of stock characters, as much as it is by the social function it serves. An airport novel is typically a fairly long but fast-paced novel of intrigue or adventure that is stereotypically found in the reading fare offered by airport newsstands.\n\nConsidering the marketing of fiction as a trade, airport novels occupy a niche similar to the one that once was occupied by pulp magazine fiction and other reading materials typically sold at newsstands and kiosks to travellers. This pulp fiction is one obvious source for the genre; sprawling historical novels of exotic adventure such as those by James Michener and James Clavell are another source. In French, such novels are called \"romans de gare\", \"railway station novels\", suggesting that writers in France were aware of this potential market at an even earlier date. The somewhat dated, Dutch term 'stationsroman' is a calque from French.\n\nAn airport novel must necessarily be superficially engaging, while not being particularly profound or philosophical, or at least, without such content being necessary for enjoyment of the book. The reader is not a person alone, in a quiet setting, contemplating deep thoughts or savouring fine writing; the reader is being jostled and penned among strangers, and seeks distraction from the boredom and inconveniences of travel. Similarly, the reader is not in a position to consult reference works, scholarly papers, or the author's previous works. The writer of an airport novel must meet the needs of readers in this situation.\n\nThe realisation that this niche market for mass market paperbacks had given rise to a new genre was slow in coming. Perhaps a defining moment in the history of the genre came in 1968, when Arthur Hailey published \"Airport\", an airport novel that used the commercial flight industry to frame an adventure yarn about a disaster in an airport. Hailey's other novels, soap opera tales with complex plots of adultery and intrigue featuring business characters, using a number of other industries as backdrops (e.g. \"The Final Diagnosis\" (hospitals); \"Hotel\" (hotels); \"Wheels\" (automobile industry); \"The Moneychangers\" (banking) represented an emerging genre.\n\nAirport novels are always paperback books of a small but thick format. These books are often printed on inexpensive newsprint. Their titles are often printed in a gilded, silvery or vividly scarlet finish, which more often than not starts very quickly to dissolve and stick to the reader's fingertips. This is not a problem for their intended purpose; they are made to be bought on impulse, and their readers often discard them when finished.\n\nAirport novels are typically quite long books; a book that a reader was able to finish before the journey was done would similarly be unsatisfying. Because of this length, the genre attracts prolific authors, who use their output as a sort of branding; each author is identified with a certain sort of story, and produces many variations of the same thing. Well-known authors' names are usually in type larger than the title on the covers of airport novels, often in embossed letters.\n\nAirport novels typically fall within a number of other fictional genres, including:\n\n\nWhatever the genre, the books must be fast-paced and easy to read. The description \"airport novel\" is mildly pejorative; it implies that the book has little lasting value, and is useful chiefly as an inexpensive form of entertainment during travel. Airport novels are sometimes contrasted with literary fiction; so that a novel with literary aspirations would be disparaged by the label.\n\nWriters whose books have been described as airport novels include:\nOn this theme, the animated television series \"The Simpsons\" included a joke in the episode \"The Joy of Sect\" (airdate February 8, 1998), in which an airport bookstore is named \"JUST CRICHTON AND KING\". Hans Moleman asks, \"Do you have anything by Robert Ludlum?\" and is immediately told by the clerk to get out.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21351987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21351987", "title": "Asterius of Amasea", "text": "Asterius of Amasea\n\nSaint Asterius of Amasea (c. 350c. 410 AD) was made Bishop of Amasea between 380 and 390 AD, after having been a lawyer. He was born in Cappadocia and probably died in Amasea in modern Turkey, then in Pontus. Significant portions of his lively sermons survive, which are especially interesting from the point of view of art history, and social life in his day. Asterius, Bishop of Amasea is not to be confused with the Arian polemicist, Asterius the Sophist. His feast day is Oct. 30.\n\nAsterius of Amasea was the younger contemporary of Amphilochius of Iconium and the three great Cappadocian Fathers. Little is known about his life, except that he was educated by a Scythian slave. Like Amphilochius, he had been a lawyer before becoming bishop between 380 and 390 AD, and he brought the skills of the professional rhetorician to his sermons. Sixteen homilies and panegyrics on the martyrs still exist, showing familiarity with the classics, and containing an unusual concentration of details of everyday life in his time. One of them, \"Oration 4: Adversus Kalendarum Festum\" attacks the pagan customs and abuses of the New Years feast, denying everything that Libanius had said supporting it – see Lord of Misrule for extensive quotations. That sermon was preached on January 1, 400 AD, which provides the main evidence, with a reference in another to his great age, to the dating of his career.\n\nIn \"Oration 11, On the martyrdom of St. Euphemia\", Asterius describes a painting of the martyrdom and compares it to pictures made by the famous pre-Christian Hellenistic painters Euphranor and Timomachus; the speech was quoted twice in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which concluded the period of Byzantine iconoclasm, as evidence in favour of the veneration of images. As described, the icon was on canvas, and displayed in a church near her tomb; it has puzzled historians, as the manner of death, from fire, differs from all other accounts in the tradition. It is an exceptionally detailed \"ekphrasis\", or description of a work of art, from this period, although scholars have wondered how well the description matched an actual work. The intended audience is uncertain, though it was apparently all-male, as they are addressed as \"gentlemen\" (\"andres\"). In Oration 1, \"On the Rich Man and Lazarus\", he objects to richly decorated clothes: through vain devices and vicious desires, you seek out fine linen, and gather the threads of the Persian worms and weave the spider's airy web; and going to the dyer, pay large prices in order that he may fish the shell-fish out of the sea and stain the garment with the blood of the creature, ----this is the act of a man surfeited, who misuses his substance, having no place to pour out the superfluity of his wealth. For this in the Gospel such a man is scourged, being portrayed as stupid and womanish, adorning himself with the embellishments of wretched girls.\nClothes decorated with religious images, worn by laymen it seems, are also condemned:having found some idle and extravagant style of weaving, which by the twining of the warp and the woof, produces the effect of a picture, and imprints upon their robes the forms of all creatures, they artfully produce, both for themselves and for their wives and children, clothing beflowered and wrought with ten thousand objects...You may see the wedding of Galilee, and the water-pots; the paralytic carrying his bed on his shoulders; the blind man being healed with the clay; the woman with the bloody issue, taking hold of the border of the garment; the sinful woman falling at the feet of Jesus; Lazarus returning to life from the grave. In doing this they consider that they are acting piously and are clad in garments pleasing to God. But if they take my advice let them sell those clothes and honor the living image of God. Do not picture Christ on your garments. It is enough that he once suffered the humiliation of dwelling in a human body which of his own accord he assumed for our sakes. So, not upon your robes but upon your soul carry about his image.\nOther interesting details of the lifestyle of the rich are mentioned in condemnation. The apparent contradiction of these positions confused Arnold Hauser, in his famous \"The Social History of Art\", into wrongly claiming Asterius as an Iconoclast, but his objection to images on clothes is on the grounds of expense and frivolity.\n\nOf Asterius's work, 16 homilies survive, and Photios lists four more. Some of these speeches have survived in medieval Latin, Georgian, and Church Slavonic translations.\n\nAn English translation exists of five sermons by Asterius, which were published in 1904 in the US under the title \"Ancient Sermons for Modern Times\", and issued as a reprint in 2007. This is the main portion of his works to exist in English, and has been transcribed online. Oration 11 has also been translated.\n\nOther sermons by Asterius of Amasea existed in the time of Photius, who referred to a further ten sermons not now known in Bibliotheca codex 271. One of these lost sermons indicates that Asterius lived to a great age.\n\nPhilip Rubens, brother of the painter, produced an edition of the homilies, published posthumously in a memorial volume after his death in 1611, together with a short biography of Philip, a selection of Latin poems that he had written, and Latin poems written in his memory by his friends.\n\nFourteen genuine sermons have been printed by Migne in the \"Patrologia Graeca\" 40, 155-480, with a Latin translation. along with other sermons \"by Asterius\" that were written by Asterius the Sophist. Another two genuine sermons were discovered in manuscript at Mount Athos by M. Bauer. Those two were first printed by A. Bretz (TU 40.1, 1914). Eleven sermons have also been translated into German.\n\n"}

The \"tituli\" are in Medieval Latin.\n\nThe Bayeux Tapestry was probably commissioned by William the Conqueror's half-brother, Bishop Odo, possibly at the same time as Bayeux Cathedral's construction in the 1070s, and completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral's dedication. It is embroidered in wool yarn on a tabby-woven linen ground using outline or stem stitch for detailing and lettering. \nA dark blue wool, almost black, is used for most of the tapestry's lettering but towards the end other colours are used, sometimes for each word and other times for each letter.\n\nThe content of the hanging is primarily pictorial but \"tituli\" are included on many scenes of the action to point out names of people and places or to explain briefly the event being depicted. The text is in Latin (which for the most part is grammatically correct), and is extremely direct, with each statement being closely tied to the scenes depicted in a given section. The text is frequently abbreviated as indicated by tildes placed over words at the place of omission of a letter. The words themselves are often demarcated by two points (which Lucien Musset likens to colons); sometimes, more important section breaks are demarcated by three points. Many personal names, mostly in English, are not Latinised and the same applies for names of places in England and for Beaurain \"Belrem\" in France. In places the spelling shows an English influence, such as the phrase \"at Hestenga ceasrta\", which in proper Latin would be \"ad Hastingae castra\"). Some French names are either archaic (\"Rednes\") or anglicised (\"Bagias\"). Sometimes \"Franci\" is used to describe the Normans who at that time certainly did not regard themselves as French.\n\nThe end of the tapestry has been missing from time immemorial and the final \"titulus\" \"Et fuga verterunt Angli\" is said by Lucien Musset to be \"entirely spurious\", added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment. The first word on the tapestry \"Edward\" is also a restoration.\n\nThe English translation provided here is of a literal nature, to reflect the simplicity of the captions themselves. The numbering scheme uses the scene numbers on the tapestry's backing cloth, which were added sometime around 1800.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3033993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3033993", "title": "Becoming Jane", "text": "Becoming Jane\n\nBecoming Jane is a 2007 British-Irish biographical romantic drama film directed by Julian Jarrold. It depicts the early life of the English author Jane Austen and her lasting love for Thomas Langlois Lefroy. American actress Anne Hathaway stars as the title character, while her romantic interest is played by Scottish actor James McAvoy. Also appearing in the film are Julie Walters, James Cromwell and Maggie Smith. The film was produced in cooperation with several companies, including Ecosse Films and Blueprint Pictures. It also received funding from the Irish Film Board and the UK Film Council Premiere Fund.\n\nThe film is partly based on the 2003 book \"Becoming Jane Austen\" by Jon Hunter Spence, who was also hired as historical consultant. The final screenplay, developed by Sarah Williams and Kevin Hood, pieced together some known facts about Austen into a coherent story, in what co-producer Graham Broadbent called \"our own Austenesque landscape.\" According to Hood, he attempted to weave together \"what we know about Austen's world from her books and letters,\" and believed Austen's personal life was the inspiration for \"Pride and Prejudice\". Jarrold began production of the film in early 2006, opting to shoot primarily in Ireland as he found it had better-preserved locations than Hampshire, England, where Austen was raised.\n\nReleased firstly in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2007 and in other countries later in the year, \"Becoming Jane\" earned approximately $37 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Hathaway's performance received mixed critical reception, with some reviewers negatively focusing on her nationality and accent. Commentators and scholars have analysed the presence of Austen characters and themes within the film, and also noted the implementation of mass marketing in the film's release.\n\nJane Austen is the younger daughter of the Reverend George Austen and his wife and has yet to find a suitable husband. She aspires to be a writer, to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father.\n\nThomas Lefroy is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation, which he describes as \"typical\" for people in the profession. Tom makes a terrible first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile, she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley, the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham. Wisley proposes but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they argue but increasingly take interest in each other and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane's literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love.\n\nTom, Jane, her brother Henry and Jane's rich widowed cousin, Eliza, Comtesse de Feullide, conspire to receive an invitation from Tom's uncle and benefactor, the Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London, for the rich \"Madame La Comtesse\" and her friends. This visit is meant to be a short break in their journey to see Jane's brother, Edward. This would allow Judge Langlois to get to know Jane before and give a blessing for their marriage. Full of hope, Jane cannot sleep during the night at the Judge's place. In a flow of inspiration, she then begins the writing of \"First Impressions\", the manuscript that will become \"Pride and Prejudice\".\n\nHowever, Judge Langlois receives a letter informing him of the genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed, not knowing that Tom has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially.\n\nJane returns home and soon learns that Tom has become engaged to someone else at the arrangement of his family. Jane accepts the marriage proposal of Mr. Wisley, whom she had earlier declined. Later, Tom realises he cannot live without Jane, and returns, asking Jane to run away with him, for \"what value will there be in life, if we are not together?\" Jane agrees, and they leave, with only Jane's sister Cassandra knowing they plan to marry in secret.\n\nOn the way, Jane stumbles upon a letter from Tom's mother, and realises his situation: he sends money he receives from his uncle back to his parents and siblings, and his family cannot survive without it. She tells Tom that they cannot elope, not with so many people depending upon him. He insists that he and Jane must marry and tells her he will earn money, but Jane tells him that it will not be enough; he will never be able to make enough money to support his dependents with a High Court judge (his uncle) as an enemy and with a penniless wife. Distraught, Tom asks her if she loves him, and she replies, \"Yes, but if our love destroys your family, then it will destroy itself, in a long, slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame.\" As she leaves, Jane catches a last glimpse of Tom through the carriage window as he briefly follows, the horses outpacing him.\n\nTwenty years later, Jane, now a successful author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom during a gathering. Henry, now married to Eliza, brings Tom to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter, who admires Jane's novels. Tom's daughter asks Jane to read aloud, but as Jane rarely does so he remonstrates with his daughter using her name, which is also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to read. The last scene shows Tom's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from \"Pride and Prejudice\", while Tom watches Jane affectionately. As she concludes, their eyes meet, and Tom joins the rest of the company in honouring Jane and her work with applause.\n\n\nIn 2004, screenwriter Sarah Williams approached Douglas Rae and Robert Bernstein of Ecosse Films with the intention of creating a film about the life of Jane Austen, a popular eighteenth century English novelist. Williams had recently read \"Becoming Jane Austen\", a 2003 biography that largely pieced together several known facts, such as Austen's meeting Tom Lefroy on Christmas 1795, into a coherent story about unrequited love. Bernstein agreed to adapt the work, believing that it depicted \"a pivotal relationship in Jane Austen's early life that was largely unknown to the public.\" The book's author, Jon Hunter Spence, was hired as a historical consultant on the film, with the task of \"see[ing] that, given that the 'story' is a work of imagination, the factual material was as accurate as possible within the limitations of the story.\"\n\nAfter Williams completed several drafts of the screenplay, the company hired Kevin Hood to aid in further script development. Bernstein believed that Hood's past work contained \"a romantic sensibility... There is a poetic quality about his writing as well as there being a rigorous emotional truth which I thought was important for Jane.\" Hood was attracted to the film because he believed \"the story is such an important one and very much the inspiration for \"Pride and Prejudice\".\" Calling Austen a \"genius\" and \"one of the top two or three prose writers of all time\", Hood thought that her relationship with Lefroy \"was absolutely essential in shaping her work.\" Hood acknowledged however that \"Becoming Jane\" is \"based on the facts as they are known and the majority of characters did exist, as did many of the situations and circumstances in the film. Some have been fictionalised, weaving together what we know about Austen's world from her books and letters, creating a rich Austenite landscape.\"\n\nJulian Jarrold became attached to direct the film in early 2005. It was his second feature film, after \"Kinky Boots\", which was released later that year. According to Bernstein, he \"liked [Jarrold's] style as it was modern and visceral, and I just had a feeling that he was the right choice. This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also with a certain amount of brio and Julian was able to bring those two things to the production.\" The director began work on the project in early 2006, rereading the novels \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"Sense and Sensibility\", and \"Persuasion\" and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence's book. Jarrold depended most heavily on the script, calling it \"a rich, witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well. It is a love story but much more besides. Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience.\" The director intended to \"bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit\" and adding \"more life and energy and fun,\" opining that past Austen adaptations had been \"a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice.\"\n\nJarrold sought to make \"Becoming Jane\" \"look and feel\" realistic \"so everything is not lit in a very glamorous Hollywood way.\" According to him, \"One of the key ideas in the film was to get away from the old, stuffy costume drama kind of feel of what Jane Austen is and to look at somebody before she becomes a genius, when she is in her early twenties and on the verge of writing her great thing; she had a real exuberance for life, intelligent and independent and a sort of outsider in rural Hampshire, more intelligent than the people around her and kicking against all those pressures.\" To further set his film apart from other costume dramas, American actress Anne Hathaway was cast as the title character. A fan of Jane Austen since she was fourteen, Hathaway immediately began rereading Austen's books, conducting historical research including perusing the author's letters, and also learned sign language, calligraphy, dance choreography, and playing the piano. She moved to England a month before production began to improve her English accent, and attempted to stay in character throughout filming, the first time she had done so for a movie.\n\nThere were concerns in some quarters that the American Hathaway was playing a beloved English writer. James McAvoy, who plays Thomas Langlois Lefroy, believed that filming in Ireland made her casting \"a bit safer\" than if they had shot in England. McAvoy accepted the role because he enjoyed Austen's writings and was eager to work with Jarrold, having collaborated with him previously on the 2002 television production \"White Teeth\". McAvoy first assumed that \"Becoming Jane\" would be directly associated with \"Pride and Prejudice\", with his character possessing similarities with Mr. Darcy; the actor soon realised however \"that the screenplay was nothing like \"Pride and Prejudice\". The screenwriter probably speculated on some of the inspiration for \"Pride and Prejudice\" but it is a completely different story.\"\n\nJulie Walters had once disliked Austen's writings but changed her mind when she read \"Pride and Prejudice\" after receiving her role as Mrs. Austen. Appearing as Mr. Austen was actor James Cromwell, who viewed his character as \"a generous gentleman, well educated and supportive of Jane for the most part. He is bedevilled by his financial circumstances but deeply in love with his wife and sympathetic to her concerns about what will happen to the girls if they don't marry.\" Joe Anderson portrayed Henry Austen, while Lucy Cohu played the widowed Eliza de Feuillide, the Austens' worldly cousin and Henry's romantic interest. Cohu believed that her character \"needs security. She is looking to be safe. She finds that security with Henry as she knows the Austen family.\"\n\nAnna Maxwell Martin appeared as Jane's sister Cassandra. The actress called her character \"terribly sensible\", noting that she \"gets her heart broken. It's very sad. She's the levelling force for Jane Austen, the wild one. She tries to get her back in line, but fails miserably.\" \"Becoming Jane\" also featured Laurence Fox as Mr. Wisley and Dame Maggie Smith as Lady Gresham, whom Jarrold viewed as possessing \"similarities to Lady Catherine De Burgh in \"Pride and Prejudice\" but in this film you get to see her hidden vulnerabilities – the pain of never having had children and her controlling maternal power over Wisley.\" Other cast members included Ian Richardson as Judge Langlois, Leo Bill as John Warren, Jessica Ashworth as Lucy Lefroy, Michael James Ford as Mr. Lefroy, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Robert Fowle, and Helen McCrory as Mrs. Radcliffe.\n\nIrish costume designer Eimer Ní Mhaoldomhnaigh designed the clothing seen in the film. She attempted to create a different style of costumes than had been seen in recent Austen adaptations, and drew inspiration from the fashions of the 1790s, a time period she considered \"fascinating\" and a \"very transitional era in terms of fashion... it was a real challenge to make it work.\" Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh attended the Cannes Film Festival in May 2006 but then had to quickly return to the \"Becoming Jane\" set to complete the last two days of filming. She later collaborated with Jarrold in the 2008 drama film \"Brideshead Revisited\".\n\nFor research, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh visited museums and art galleries, and also read Austen's letters and novels. She was interested in both the effects of continental fashions on English clothing and the differences between social classes. While she recognised that 1795 \"marked the beginning\" of the empire waistline trend, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh also understood this fashion would have barely been introduced to Austen's circle in the country; rather, the film displayed many costume designs from the early 1790s. She explained, \"We wanted to show that transition especially for the women. The look in London is very different from the look in the countryside. For the country ball the fashion for the older women is more of the old style but for the younger women we show the introduction of the Empire line.\"\n\nThe costume designer created all of Hathaway's outfits from scratch, and \"looked for images of a young Jane Austen.\" Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh explained, \"I wanted to get her youthfulness and innocence across through her dress. But crucially there was also her strength of character. So we kept away from frills and flounces. I wanted a definite look that was quite strong but also pretty at the same time. Jane was living on a working farm so her dress had to be practical as well. In terms of the costume we were definitely trying to steer away from the chocolate box image that we associate with Jane Austen.\"\n\nNí Mhaoldhomhnaigh dressed McAvoy in rich fabrics, such as velvet and beaver fur, to help distinguish him from the other men. She recalled that \"he wears very stylish waist coats and cut-away jackets. With Jane around he'd have an extra swagger in front of her. James (McAvoy) was really into it. We'd talk about the colours and fabrics to achieve his distinctive look.\" Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh and Maggie Smith agreed that Lady Gresham's dresses would be modelled after 1770s fashion, which was \"the sort of dress that the character would have worn when she was much younger and suited her back then. Lady Gresham is very much her own character and is not someone who is dictated to by fashion.\" Smith's dresses contained stiff fabrics \"to emphasise a woman who was very set in her ways\".\n\nProduced independently by Ecosse, \"Becoming Jane\" was given a limited budget of €12.7 million (£9 million or $16.5 million). Production designer Eve Stewart researched Regency literature and Austen's life, and along with Jarrold, scouted locations in Dublin and nearby counties for five weeks in January and February 2006. They ultimately opted to shoot in Dublin and the Irish counties of Meath and Wicklow instead of Hampshire, the birthplace of Austen, because it held \"a sense of countryside that felt more unchanged,\" while Hampshire had unfortunately become too \"groomed and manicured\". Jarrold also found \"a great variety of Georgian houses and older houses\" in Ireland. His production received funds from the Irish Film Board, the UK Film Council Premiere Fund, 2 Entertain, Scion Films, and Miramax Films. Film critic Andrew Sarris noted that in Ireland \"happily, there are still architectural traces of life more than 200 years ago to correspond with the year 1795.\" However, Ireland did include a few disadvantages: Stewart found that \"the rural aspects were the most difficult as the Irish country landscape is nothing like Hampshire. There are no rolling hills so the vegetation and the landscaping was the trickiest thing for me as a production designer.\"\nDue to its low budget, \"Becoming Jane\" was filmed on a \"tight\" schedule of eight weeks from March to May 2006. Jarrold observed however that because Ecosse was not a film studio, he had more creative freedom. Bernstein stated of filming, \"We recreated a world that Jane Austen lovers can recognise and associate with. But hopefully we can also take them into areas and places like the boxing club, the cricket game and the fair that do not feature in Jane Austen's fiction. They are sort of seedy and dangerous areas that are not normally associated with Austen.\" Jarrold found filming \"very difficult. We had to make it work in the locations that we had as efficiently as possible.\" Filming outdoors was often so cold that Hathaway turned blue and had difficulty saying her lines; Automated Dialogue Replacement in post-production helped correct this by re-dubbing her lines.\n\nThe story's central location was set at Steventon rectory where Austen was raised. While it had been demolished in 1824, Jarrold and his crew \"fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like the original... We honed the script as well to make it as practical as possible.\" Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth, \"I think that you will lose the central thrust of the story unless you understand the status of the Austen's and that they are pretty poor. Jane spent all her formative years there and that was the place that influenced her view of the world. You have to believe that the family live in that house because that is a crucial piece of the jigsaw.\" Scenes at Steventon rectory were filmed in Higginsbrook House, a few miles off Trim in County Meath. Later in fall 2006, it appeared again as the house of the Morlands in \"Northanger Abbey\".\n\nCharleville Castle stood in for the interior scenes of Lady Gresham's estate, while Kilruddery House, an old Elizabethan revival estate, provided the exterior shots of the property. Other filming sites included Cloghlee Bridge in the Dublin Mountains (as Mr. Austen's rectory) and Dublin's Henrietta Street and North Great George's Street as Regency London. A house on Henrietta Street also provided the filming site for Mrs. Radcliffe's residence. Gentleman Jackson's club, where Lefroy boxes, was represented by \"the dark and otherworldly\" Mother Redcaps tavern, also in Dublin.\n\nThe musical score of the film was written by English composer Adrian Johnston. To prepare melodies, he reviewed music books that had belonged to the Austen family. The first track, \"First Impressions\", has been described as a \"depressing\" song that \"exhibits slow, pure and classical piano work\"; one critic quipped that it belonged in \"Becoming Sylvia Plath \". Later tracks ranged \"in mood from upbeat and playful to somber and teary.\" In his review of the score, Tim Clark of Soundtrack.net lamented the \"absence of a truly memorable theme, despite a wealth of thematic material,\" and found similarities to Dario Marianelli's composition for the 2005 film \"Pride & Prejudice\".\n\nPatsy Morita, a music critic for \"Allmusic\", wrote that the second half of Johnston's score becomes as \"unremarkable\" as \"so many other dramatic film scores of the early twenty-first century.\" She continued, \"It fulfills its purpose of underscoring the emotion of the story by being moody and slow to change melodically and harmonically, and by using many pregnant pauses and minimalist-leaning repetitive figures.\" Morita added that \"there is nothing in it to draw attention away from the film.\" The score later received a nomination for Best Original Film Score at the 2008 Ivor Novello Awards. The film soundtrack was released on 31 July 2007. A track listing for the album is as follows:\n\nHenry Purcell's \"Hole in the Wall,\" also known as \"St. Martin's Lane,\" which is featured in the ballroom scene, was first published in 1695 and is highly unlikely to have been common during the Regency, when Jane Austen was a young adult.\n\nDownloadable editions of the original soundtrack include six bonus tracks of music heard in the film:\n\nJon Spence, the author of the biography the film was based on, identifies \"Tom Lefroy as the love of Austen's life and her relationship with him as the origin of her genius. But he never suggests that there was an aborted elopement (much less subsequent reading sessions with any of Lefroy's children). And he is careful, as the filmmakers are not, to clarify that in speculating about Austen's romantic experience he is reading between the lines of the family records and of the three rather opaque Austen letters that are his principal sources.\"\n\nAn important deviation of the film's plot from history is that there is scant evidence in real life Austen and Lefroy's relationship went beyond acquaintance. Rather, all that is known of them together is that they danced at three Christmas balls before Tom returned to school and that Jane was \"too proud\" to ask his aunt about him two years later. In the latter years of Tom Lefroy's life, he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew, and admitted to having loved Jane Austen, but stated that it was a \"boyish love\". As is written in a letter sent from T.E.P. Lefroy to James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870,My late venerable uncle ... said in so many words that he was in love with her, although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love. As this occurred in a friendly & private conversation, I feel some doubt whether I ought to make it public.Lori Smith, author of \"The Jane Austen Guide to Life\", opined that:No doubt this relationship and her [Jane's] repartee with Tom fueled her writing. Whether it was \"her greatest inspiration\" as the trailers for \"Becoming Jane\" claim, well, that's debatable. But I'm sure it provided as spark.However, contrary to the film's story line, Jane had attempted her first full-length novel before she met Tom and had already read \"The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling\" before meeting him. In a cut scene from the movie, it is clear that she is reading the novel for the second time, but in the theatrical release without that scene, it appears he introduces her to it.\n\nVarious commentators have offered opinions concerning the presence in the film of characters and themes from Austen's works, particularly with \"Pride and Prejudice\". Deborah Cartmell contended that Hathaway's Austen is a \"replica of Elizabeth Bennet (with a touch of impetuous Lydia thrown in),\" and added that the associations between Austen and Elizabeth are \"more explicit than in\" any other Austen biopic. Tim Robey of \"The Daily Telegraph\" declared that the film took \"good old \"P&P\"s storyline and replace[d] Elizabeth Bennet with Austen herself [and added] a real-life pseudo-Darcy from the skimpiest of biographical evidence.\" \"A Companion to Jane Austen\" observed that the \"physicality\" of Jane and Lefroy's kiss was similar to the \"passionate kiss\" between Elizabeth and Darcy in the 1995 serial \"Pride and Prejudice\".\n\n\"Empire\" magazine further expressed that \n\nThe implementation of mass marketing in the film's production and release has attracted notice from film and literary scholars. Dianne F. Sadoff writes that \"Becoming Jane\" \"confirms the two-decades-long megaplexing of Jane Austen.\" According to Andrew Higson, the film was another example of \"Austen Power\" and the desire of filmmakers to \"exploit the possibilities of both the Austen industry and the market for literary cinema and television – and more generally, the market for 'traditional' English drama.\" While reviewing Austen adaptations of the 1990s and 2000s in her book \"Heritage Film: Nation, Genre and Representation\", author Belén Vidal viewed \"Becoming Jane\" as yet another \"transformation of Austen's novels into icons of popular culture.\" To Vidal, this and other productions, such as \"The Jane Austen Book Club\" (2007) and \"Miss Austen Regrets\" (2008), confirmed \"the generic status of the Austen phenomenon whilst dispensing with the incorporation of the literary text.\"\n\n\"Becoming Jane\" followed a different formula than the Austen adaptations of the 1990s and attempted to draw viewers from a variety of demographic groups. Hathaway's casting was intended to attract young female viewers who had enjoyed the actress in \"The Princess Diaries\" and \"\". According to producers, the view was that this demographic group would have been in their early teens during the release of the \"Princess\" films, making them \"the right age\" for Austen as 15-year-olds. Expecting \"Becoming Jane\" to be a popular film, in February 2007 Penguin Books announced new editions of six of Austen's best-known novels; their redesigned covers were intended to attract teenage readers.\n\n\"Becoming Jane\" has been referred to as a heritage costume drama film, a genre which has been popular in the United States among both its audiences and its film studios. According to Andrew Higson, \"Becoming Jane\" falls into the continuing trend of American attitudes influencing English film. Belén Vidal wrote that the film \"exploit[s] a well-defined heritage iconography and strategically combine[s] American stars with supporting casts of international 'quality' players.\" Hilary Radner analysed the presence of the \"marriage plot\" – a girl succeeding only by marrying the man of her choice – in film and television, and noted that while \"Becoming Jane\" critiques this film trope, it \"points to the power of the traditional marriage plot as a residual paradigm influencing feminine identity.\"\n\nJarrold's adaptation also came in the wake of a number of literary biographical films, such as \"Shakespeare in Love\" and \"Miss Potter\". Deborah Cartmell, author of \"Screen Adaptations: Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice: A Close Study of the Relationship between Text and Film\", found similarities between \"Becoming Jane\" and \"Shakespeare in Love\" \"almost so obvious that the [former] film risks the accusation of being dangerously derivative.\" A given example included the characters of Austen and William Shakespeare inputting their personal experiences directly into their works. Marina Cano López and Rosa María García-Periago explained that the film \"follows the path opened by John Madden’s \"Shakespeare in Love\". The numerous intertextual connections between both movies can be reduced to one: just as Shakespeare is imagined as the hero of his own play, Jane Austen becomes the heroine of her own novel.\" Among other listed similarities, they noted that the romantic interests of both protagonists serve as their literary muses, and that the middle part of both films \"lie\" when viewed from a historical perspective.\n\nThe world premiere of \"Becoming Jane\" took place in London on 5 March 2007. It was released to cinemas on 9 March 2007 in the United Kingdom and a week later in Ireland by Buena Vista International. It ultimately grossed £3.78 million in the UK and Ireland, placing in sixteenth among all UK films for the year in those markets. Sixty-three percent of the audience was female, and 40.5 percent were above the age of 55. The film's performance was considered \"disappointing\", and it influenced the US release date. It arrived in Australia on 29 March.\n\nMiramax Films distributed the film in the United States, giving it a release date of 3 August 2007. Originally, the studio intended to release \"Becoming Jane\" in June or July due to a \"counter-programming\" strategy, attempting to attract demographic groups who were not interested in large blockbusters. The film was expected to perform well during all seven days of the week and gradually gain more viewers during its time in cinemas. Due to the presence of recognizable stars such as Hathaway, \"Becoming Jane\" was expected to also do well among mainstream audiences. However, due to its weak UK release, the film's release was moved to August, when it opened on 100 screens in its first week. It increased to 601 screens the following week, later reaching 1,210 screens. While the film made under $1 million in its first week, it was considered \"a highly respectable showing for a heritage biopic\" and enough of a figure to \"justify a ten-week run.\" The film eventually grossed a total of $18,670,946 in the US.\n\nOn an international scale, \"Becoming Jane\" received a total of $37,311,672. It earned its highest grosses in the US, the UK, and Australia.\n\n\"Becoming Jane\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK on 10 September 2007, a month after it arrives in cinemas in the US. On 12 February 2008, Disney and Miramax released the DVD and Blu-ray in the US. Both versions contained audio commentary with Jarrold, Hood, and Bernstein, deleted scenes, \"Pop-Up Facts & Footnotes,\" and a featurette called \"Discovering the Real Jane Austen\". The US home video rights to the film have since been picked up by Echo Bridge Entertainment and the film has seen several reissues on Blu-ray and DVD, often packaged with other films such as \"Jane Eyre\".\n\nFilm review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 57% based on reviews from 136 critics. The site summarized the consensus: \"Although \"Becoming Jane\" is a well-crafted period piece, it lacks fresh insight into the life and works of Jane Austen. The film focuses too much on wardrobe and not enough on Austen's achievements.\" \"The New York Times\" called the film a \"triumph\" for Hathaway, but observed that \"the screenplay’s pseudo-Austen tone is so consistent that its lapses into modern romance-novel fantasy [and] threatens to derail the film.\" More positive, \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the film \"a charmer,\" articulating that \"the supporting cast (Julie Walters, Maggie Smith, James Cromwell) is top-drawer; and Anne Hathaway, with her coltish beauty and frank demeanor, is a welcome Jane.\"\n\nCritics lauded Hathaway and McAvoy for the chemistry between their characters, finding that it lent authenticity to the love story between Austen and Lefroy. While Hathaway was admired for her performance by some critics, some reviews negatively focused on her nationality as well as the inauthenticity of her accent. James McAvoy defended the decision of casting Hathaway by stating that a director should, \"find the right actor…and [she] is undoubtedly brilliant.\" Hathaway herself admitted the persistent tendency to \"sound too much like myself and not at all like Jane\", blaming cold weather in Ireland, which meant she had to do voice retakes for several scenes. Nonetheless, Jarrold praised Hathaway for her performance. In a wrap up party after the filming, the director confessed that the actress had been a different person, \"not just her accent but also the whole character, the way of holding yourself and speaking was so completely different\".\n\n\"Time Out London\" gave a positive review, enunciating that \"Overall, the approach is less fluffily contrived than you’d expect, and though the alignment of circumstance and social status thwarting innocent passions is hardly fresh, it’s handled with thoughtful decorum. The emotional temperature’s rather restrained as a result, but with luxury casting all down the line... elegant visuals balancing verdant and velvet, and a delightful faux-classical score, it’s a classy package, all right – just missing the extra spark.\" Some reviewers have questioned the historical accuracy of the film, for instance critiquing the depicted relationship between Austen and Lefroy.\n\n\"Becoming Jane\" and the 2008 BBC serial \"Sense and Sensibility\" have been credited with \"renew[ing] interest\" in Jane Austen's House Museum in Chawton. According to Robin Bischert, the chief executive of Bath Tourism Plus, Bath, Somerset gained \"more than £150,000 worth of free media exposure\" in the wake of \"Becoming Jane\" and \"Persuasion\", a 2007 television production adapted from another Austen novel. As the city is heavily associated with Austen, the company took advantage of \"Becoming Jane\"s release in order to celebrate the author and her writings. In late September 2007, Bath launched the seventh Jane Austen festival, which included a parade of people in Regency costumes, readings, tours, and discussions about the author. In addition, the city offered events such as Tea with Mr. Darcy to mark the release of the \"Becoming Jane\" DVD.\n\nThe film's production had a positive impact on the Irish economy, as it resulted in a direct expenditure of €7.1 million, providing jobs for 116 crew members and 17 actors, and also offered 1,250 days of work for extras.

These characters imitate French cursiva letters of the Renaissance.\n\nThe first book in the new type was \"Dialogue de la vie et de la mort\", a French version of Innocenzo Ringhieri's dialogue, in the dedication of which Granjon explains his purpose in cutting the new design. He calls the typeface \"lettres françaises\" and suggests that France like other nations should have a type based on the national hand; his model was contemporary handwriting. The popular name for the type came from the titles of two early books in which it was used: Erasmus's \"La Civilité puerile\", Jean Bellère, Antwerp, 1559, and \"La Civile honesteté pour les enfans\", R. Breton, Paris, 1560. \"Civilité\" meant \"good manners\" and it was thought an advantage that children should learn to read from a book printed in a type resembling current handwriting. Between 1557 and 1562 Granjon printed some 20 books in this type. Two other Paris printers had typefaces made that were very similar and Granjon himself supplied his version to Guillaume Silvius and to Christophe Plantin at Antwerp.\n\nThey were mostly employed to print books in Flanders, Holland, England, and France. In the latter, they were used until the second half of the 19th century to print children's lesson-books teaching civility and manners from which the type got its name. Civilité type did not win great popularity in France although used occasionally at all periods. Another version of civilité were used in one book printed in 1597 by Claude Micard, and two others in two books printed by Jean de Tournes in 1581 and 1598. In the mid 19th century Louis Perrin of Lyons printed J. Soulary's \"Sonnets humouristiques\" in civilité. Granjon's experiment cannot be said to have been a success: one of the grave disadvantages was that many ligatures were required and some letters had more than one variant.\n\n"}

{"id": "1561411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1561411", "title": "Color balance", "text": "Color balance\n\nIn photography and image processing, color balance is the global adjustment of the intensities of the colors (typically red, green, and blue primary colors). An important goal of this adjustment is to render specific colors – particularly neutral colors – correctly. Hence, the general method is sometimes called gray balance, neutral balance, or white balance. Color balance changes the overall mixture of colors in an image and is used for color correction. Generalized versions of color balance are used to correct colors other than neutrals or to deliberately change them for effect.\n\nImage data acquired by sensors – either film or electronic image sensors – must be transformed from the acquired values to new values that are appropriate for color reproduction or display. Several aspects of the acquisition and display process make such color correction essential – including the fact that the acquisition sensors do not match the sensors in the human eye, that the properties of the display medium must be accounted for, and that the ambient viewing conditions of the acquisition differ from the display viewing conditions.\n\nThe color balance operations in popular image editing applications usually operate directly on the red, green, and blue channel pixel values, without respect to any color sensing or reproduction model. In film photography, color balance is typically achieved by using color correction filters over the lights or on the camera lens.\n\nSometimes the adjustment to keep neutrals neutral is called \"white balance\", and the phrase \"color balance\" refers to the adjustment that in addition makes other colors in a displayed image appear to have the same general appearance as the colors in an original scene. It is particularly important that neutral (gray, neutral, white) colors in a scene appear neutral in the reproduction. \n\nHumans relate to flesh tones more critically than other colors. Trees, grass and sky can all be off without concern, but if human flesh tones are 'off' then the human subject can look sick or dead. To address this critical color balance issue, the tri-color primaries themselves are formulated to \"not\" balance as a true neutral color. The purpose of this color primary imbalance is to more faithfully reproduce the flesh tones through the entire brightness range. \n\nUS Patent 2,850,563 states \"...effecting a non-distorted transfer of a flesh tone through the system over its entire brightness range, notwithstanding the inherent non-linear transfer characteristic of said system...\".\n\nViewing of the flesh altered primaries is available with a /\"Color Separation Guide\" or \"Color Control Patch\" (same thing). There are 18 color swatches on the guide; 9 at 100% density, and the same 9 at 50% density. The 3-color swatch at 50% density thereon shows the result of the flesh tone primaries, at a 1:1:1 ratio, directly.\n\nMost digital cameras have means to select color correction based on the type of scene lighting, using either manual lighting selection, automatic white balance, or custom white balance. The algorithms for these processes perform generalized chromatic adaptation.\n\nMany methods exist for color balancing. Setting a button on a camera is a way for the user to indicate to the processor the nature of the scene lighting. Another option on some cameras is a button which one may press when the camera is pointed at a gray card or other neutral colored object. This captures an image of the ambient light, which enables a digital camera to set the correct color balance for that light.\n\nThere is a large literature on how one might estimate the ambient lighting from the camera data and then use this information to transform the image data. A variety of algorithms have been proposed, and the quality of these has been debated. A few examples and examination of the references therein will lead the reader to many others. Examples are Retinex, an artificial neural network or a Bayesian method.\n\nColor balancing an image affects not only the neutrals, but other colors as well. An image that is not color balanced is said to have a color cast, as everything in the image appears to have been shifted towards one color. Color balancing may be thought in terms of removing this color cast.\n\nColor balance is also related to color constancy. Algorithms and techniques used to attain color constancy are frequently used for color balancing, as well. Color constancy is, in turn, related to chromatic adaptation. Conceptually, color balancing consists of two steps: first, determining the illuminant under which an image was captured; and second, scaling the components (e.g., R, G, and B) of the image or otherwise transforming the components so they conform to the viewing illuminant.\n\nViggiano found that white balancing in the camera's native RGB color model tended to produce less color inconstancy (i.e., less distortion of the colors) than in monitor RGB for over 4000 hypothetical sets of camera sensitivities. This difference typically amounted to a factor of more than two in favor of camera RGB. This means that it is advantageous to get color balance right at the time an image is captured, rather than edit later on a monitor. If one must color balance later, balancing the raw image data will tend to produce less distortion of chromatic colors than balancing in monitor RGB.\n\nColor balancing is sometimes performed on a three-component image (e.g., RGB) using a 3x3 matrix. This type of transformation is appropriate if the image was captured using the wrong white balance setting on a digital camera, or through a color filter.\n\nIn principle, one wants to scale all relative luminances in an image so that objects which are believed to be neutral appear so. If, say, a surface with formula_1 was believed to be a white object, and if 255 is the count which corresponds to white, one could multiply all red values by 255/240. Doing analogously for green and blue would result, at least in theory, in a color balanced image. In this type of transformation the 3x3 matrix is a diagonal matrix.\n\nwhere formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5 are the color balanced red, green, and blue components of a pixel in the image; formula_6, formula_7, and formula_8 are the red, green, and blue components of the image before color balancing, and formula_9, formula_10, and formula_11 are the red, green, and blue components of a pixel which is believed to be a white surface in the image before color balancing. This is a simple scaling of the red, green, and blue channels, and is why color balance tools in Photoshop and the GIMP have a white eyedropper tool. It has been demonstrated that performing the white balancing in the phosphor set assumed by sRGB tends to produce large errors in chromatic colors, even though it can render the neutral surfaces perfectly neutral.\n\nIf the image may be transformed into CIE XYZ tristimulus values, the color balancing may be performed there. This has been termed a “wrong von Kries” transformation. Although it has been demonstrated to offer usually poorer results than balancing in monitor RGB, it is mentioned here as a bridge to other things. Mathematically, one computes:\n\nwhere formula_13, formula_14, and formula_15 are the color-balanced tristimulus values; formula_16, formula_17, and formula_18 are the tristimulus values of the viewing illuminant (the white point to which the image is being transformed to conform to); formula_19, formula_20, and formula_21 are the tristimulus values of an object believed to be white in the un-color-balanced image, and formula_22, formula_23, and formula_24 are the tristimulus values of a pixel in the un-color-balanced image. If the tristimulus values of the monitor primaries are in a matrix formula_25 so that:\n\nwhere formula_27, formula_28, and formula_29 are the un-gamma corrected monitor RGB, one may use:\n\nJohannes von Kries, whose theory of rods and three color-sensitive cone types in the retina has survived as the dominant explanation of color sensation for over 100 years, motivated the method of converting color to the LMS color space, representing the effective stimuli for the Long-, Medium-, and Short-wavelength cone types that are modeled as adapting independently. A 3x3 matrix converts RGB or XYZ to LMS, and then the three LMS primary values are scaled to balance the neutral; the color can then be converted back to the desired final color space:\n\nwhere formula_32, formula_33, and formula_34 are the color-balanced LMS cone tristimulus values; formula_35, formula_36, and formula_37 are the tristimulus values of an object believed to be white in the un-color-balanced image, and formula_38, formula_39, and formula_40 are the tristimulus values of a pixel in the un-color-balanced image.\n\nMatrices to convert to LMS space were not specified by von Kries, but can be derived from CIE color matching functions and LMS color matching functions when the latter are specified; matrices can also be found in reference books.\n\nBy Viggiano's measure, and using his model of gaussian camera spectral sensitivities, most camera RGB spaces performed better than either monitor RGB or XYZ. If the camera's raw RGB values are known, one may use the 3x3 diagonal matrix:\n\nand then convert to a working RGB space such as sRGB or Adobe RGB after balancing.\nComparisons of images balanced by diagonal transforms in a number of different RGB spaces have identified several such spaces that work better than others, and better than camera or monitor spaces, for chromatic adaptation, as measured by several color appearance models; the systems that performed statistically as well as the best on the majority of the image test sets used were the \"Sharp\", \"Bradford\", \"CMCCAT\", and \"ROMM\" spaces.\n\nThe best color matrix for adapting to a change in illuminant is not necessarily a diagonal matrix in a fixed color space. It has long been known that if the space of illuminants can be described as a linear model with \"N\" basis terms, the proper color transformation will be the weighted sum of \"N\" fixed linear transformations, not necessarily consistently diagonalizable.\n\n\n"}

Part of the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, it survives in two major versions.\n\nThe tale exists in two main recensions. The earliest witness of the first version is the Lebor na hUidre (LU), compiled in the 12th century. The principal scribe (M) was responsible for writing down the main text, while a later reviser (H) erased the ending to make room for his own sequel from the time of Cú Chulainn's birth. According to H's notes, the text was included in the Cín Dromma Snechtai, an 8th-century manuscript now lost. Further copies of Recension I have come down in six manuscripts of the 15th and 16th centuries, all of them in some way associated with Connacht.\n\nThe second recension survives in Egerton 1782 and D IV 2, where they immediately follow the first. This recension is also called \"Feis Tige Becfholtaig\" “The feast of (or: passing of the night in) Becfholtach's house” in D IV 2.\n\n\nIn the earliest version of \"Compert Chon Culainn\", Cú Chulainn's mother Deichtine is the daughter and charioteer of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster, and accompanies him as he and the nobles of Ulster hunt a flock of magical birds. Snow falls, and the Ulstermen seek shelter, finding a house where they are made welcome. Their host's wife goes into labour, and Deichtine assists at the birth of a baby boy. A mare gives birth to two colts at the same time. The next morning, the Ulstermen find themselves at the Brug na Bóinde (the neolithic mound at Newgrange). The house and its occupants have disappeared, but the child and the colts remain. Deichtine takes the boy home and raises him to early childhood, but he falls sick and dies. The god Lug appears to her and tells her he was their host that night, and that he has put his child in her womb, who is to be called Sétanta. Her pregnancy is a scandal as she is betrothed to Sualtam mac Róich, and the Ulstermen suspect Conchobar of being the father, so she aborts the child and goes to her husband's bed \"virgin-whole\". She then conceives a son whom she names Sétanta. This has been interpreted as a triple conception, marking the child out as someone special.\n\nIn the later, and better-known, version of \"Compert Con Culainn\", Deichtine is Conchobar's sister, and disappears from Emain Macha, the Ulster capital. As in the previous version, the Ulstermen go hunting a flock of magical birds, are overtaken by a snowstorm and seek shelter in a nearby house. Their host is Lug, but this time his wife, who gives birth to a son that night, is Deichtine herself. The child is named Sétanta.\n\nThe nobles of Ulster argue over which of them is to be his foster-father, until the wise Morann decides he should be fostered by several of them: Conchobar himself; Sencha mac Ailella, who will teach him judgement and eloquent speech; the wealthy Blaí Briugu, who will protect and provide for him; the noble warrior Fergus mac Róich, who will care for him and teach him to protect the weak; the poet Amergin, who will educate him, and his wife Findchóem, who will nurse him. He is brought up in the house of Amergin and Findchóem on Muirthemne Plain in modern County Louth, alongside their son Conall Cernach.\n\n\n\n"}

Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule (e.g. \"The \"adjective\" \"noun\" \"adverb\" \"verb\" the \"adjective\" \"noun\".\" as in \"The green duck sweetly sang the dreadful dirge.\") or by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed.\n\nThis technique was invented by surrealists and is similar to an old parlour game called Consequences in which players write in turn on a sheet of paper, fold it to conceal part of the writing, and then pass it to the next player for a further contribution. Surrealism principal founder André Breton reported that it started in fun, but became playful and eventually enriching. Breton said the diversion started about 1925, but Pierre Reverdy wrote that it started much earlier, at least as early as 1918.\n\nThe name is derived from a phrase that resulted when Surrealists first played the game, \"\" (\"The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine.\") André Breton writes that the game developed at the residence of friends in an old house of Montparnasse at 54 rue du Château (no longer existing). These artists started the movement Yves Tanguy, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Prévert, Benjamin Péret, Pierre Reverdy, and André Breton. Other participants probably included Max Morise, Joan Miró, Man Ray, Simone Collinet, Tristan Tzara, Georges Hugnet, René Char, and Paul and Nusch Éluard.\n\nHenry Miller often partook of the game to pass time in French cafés during the 1930s.\n\nIn a variant now known as picture consequences, instead of sentences, portions of a person were drawn. Later the game was adapted to drawing and collage, producing a result similar to children's books in which the pages were cut into thirds, the top third pages showing the head of a person or animal, the middle third the torso, and the bottom third the legs, with children having the ability to \"mix and match\" by turning pages.\n\nIn the context of parties, it can be run as a circle game in which a group of people cooperatively draw a person, taking about 20 minutes to play.\n\nAn image of a person is drawn in portions, with the paper folded after each portion so that later participants cannot see earlier portions.\nIt has been recommended for use as a tool for teaching about tattoos.\nPicture consequences can be used to practice vocabulary and to encourage a class to work together.\nThe game is also recommended as a \"rainy day\" game. The point of the game is the surprise reveal at the end or for simple fun.\n\nThe person can be drawn in four steps: The head, the torso, the legs and the feet. As a last step, a player may label the drawing, still unseen, with someone's name.\n\nThe name \"picture consequences\" is also sometimes used to describe Telephone Pictionary, a game in which players alternate writing descriptions and matching illustrations based on the previous step.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe video game Donner Party, an edited Rom hack of Monster Party, employs this technique by having each stage edited by a different person.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "742784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=742784", "title": "Film colorization", "text": "Film colorization\n\nFilm colorization (or colourisation) is any process that adds color to black-and-white, sepia, or other monochrome moving-picture images. It may be done as a special effect, to \"modernize\" black-and-white films, or to restore color films. The first examples date from the early 20th century, but colorization has become common with the advent of digital image processing.\n\nThe first film colorization methods were hand done by individuals. For example, at least 4% of George Méliès's output, including some prints of \"A Trip to the Moon\" from 1902 and other major films such as \"The Kingdom of the Fairies\", \"The Impossible Voyage\", and \"The Barber of Seville\" were individually hand-colored by Elisabeth Thuillier's coloring lab in Paris. Thuillier, a former colorist of glass and celluloid products, directed a studio of two hundred people painting directly on film stock with brushes, in the colors she chose and specified; each worker was assigned a different color in assembly line style, with more than twenty separate colors often used for a single film. Thuillier's lab produced about sixty hand-colored copies of \"A Trip to the Moon\", but only one copy is known to exist. The first full-length feature film made by a hand-colored process was \"The Miracle\" of 1912.\n\nThe process was always done by hand, sometimes using a stencil cut from a second print of the film, such as the Pathécolor process. As late as the 1920s, hand coloring processes were used for individual shots in \"Greed\" (1924) and \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1925) (both utilizing the Handschiegl color process); and rarely, an entire feature-length movie such as \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" (1925) and \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" (1926).\n\nThese colorization methods were employed until effective color film processes were developed. During the late 1960s and the early 1970s, black-and-white \"Betty Boop\", \"Mickey Mouse\", and \"Looney Tunes\" cartoons were redistributed in color. Supervised by Fred Ladd, color was added by tracing the original black-and-white frames onto new animation cels, and then adding color to the new cels in South Korea. To cut time and expense, Ladd's process skipped every other frame, cutting the frame rate in half; this technique considerably degraded the quality and timing of the original animation, to the extent that some animation was not carried over or mistakenly altered. The most recent redrawn colorized black-and-white cartoons are the Fleischer Studios/Famous Studios' \"Popeye\" cartoons, the Harman-Ising \"Merrie Melodies\", and MGM's \"The Captain and the Kids\" cartoons, which were colorized in 1987 for airing on the Turner networks. With computer technology, studios were able to add color to black-and-white films by digitally tinting single objects in each frame of the film until it was fully colorized (the first authorized computer-colorizations of B&W cartoons were commissioned by Warner Bros. in 1990). The initial process was invented by Canadian Wilson Markle and was first used in 1970 to add color to monochrome footage of the moon from the Apollo program missions.\n\nComputerized colorization began in the 1970s using the technique invented by Wilson Markle. These early attempts at colourisation have soft contrast and fairly pale, flat, washed-out color; however, the technology improved steadily since the 1980s.\n\nTo perform digital colorization, a digitized copy of the best black and white film print available is used. Technicians, with the aid of computer software, associate a range of gray levels to each object, and indicate to the computer any movement of the objects within a shot. The software is also capable of sensing variations in the light level from frame-to-frame and correcting it if necessary. The technician selects a color for each object based on (1) common \"memory\" colors such as blue sky, white clouds, flesh tones and green grass, and (2) based on any known information about the movie. If color publicity stills or props from the movie are available to examine, authentic colors may be applied. (3) In the absence of any better information, the technician may choose a color which they feel fits the gray level and is consistent with what a director might have chosen for the scene. The computer software then associates a variation of the basic color with each gray level in the object, while keeping intensity levels the same as in the monochrome original. The software then follows each object from frame to frame, applying the same color until the object leaves the frame. As new objects come into the frame, the technician must associate colors to each new object in the same way as described above. This technique was patented in 1991.\n\nA major obstacle with this method is it is highly labour-intensive. In order to colourise a still image, an artist typically begins by dividing the image into regions, and then assigning a color to each region. This approach, also known as the segmentation method, is laborious, as the process of dividing the picture into correct segments is time-consuming. This occurs primarily when there have been no fully automatic algorithms to identify fuzzy or complex region boundaries, such as between a subject's hair and face. Colorization of moving images also requires tracking regions as movement occurs from one frame to the next (motion compensation). Several companies claim to have produced automatic region-tracking algorithms.\n\nLegend Films describes their core technology as pattern recognition and background compositing which moves and morphs foreground and background masks from frame to frame. In the process, backgrounds are colorized separately in a single composite frame which functions as a visual database of a cut, and includes all offset data on each camera movement. Once the foreground areas are colourised, background masks are applied frame-to-frame.\n\nTimebrush describes a process based on neural net technology which produces saturated and crisp colors with clear lines and no apparent spill-over. The process is cost effective, as it relies on computer, rather than human effort, and is equally suitable for low-budget colorization, as well as broadcast-quality, or theatrical projection.\n\nA team at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Benin School of Computer Science and Engineering describe their method as an interactive process which does not require precise, manual, region detection, nor accurate tracking, and is based on the premise that adjacent pixels in space and time which have similar gray levels, should also have similar colors. At the University of Minnesota, a color propagation method was developed which uses geodesic distance.\n\nA highly labor-intensive process, employed by the UK-based film and video colorization artist Stuart Humphryes in conjunction with video restoration company SVS Resources, was employed by the BBC in 2013 for the commercial release of two \"Doctor Who\" serials; the first episode of \"The Mind of Evil\" and newly discovered black and white footage in the director's cut of \"Terror of the Zygons\". For these projects, approximately 7,000 key-frames (approximately every 5th PAL video frame) were fully colorized by hand, without the use of masks, layers or the segmentation method. These were then utilised by SVS Resources to interpolate the colour across the intervening surrounding frames using a part computerized/part manual process.\n\nIn 2017, \"Algorithmia\" released a free, online colourisation service. Although sample limited, the service uses neural nets with artificial intelligence which is trained on colourised images that are fed to deep generative adversarial networks along with automatically generated grayscale.\n\nThe earliest form of colorization introduced limited color into a black-and-white film using dyes, as a visual effect. The earliest Edison films, most notably the \"Annabelle Serpentine Dance\" series, were also the earliest examples of colorization, done by painting aniline dyes onto the emulsion.\n\nAround 1905, Pathé introduced \"Pathéchrome\", a stencil process that required cutting one or more stencils for each film frame with the aid of a reducing pantograph.\n\nIn 1916, the Handschiegl Color Process was invented for Cecil B. DeMille's film \"Joan the Woman\" (1917). Another early example of the Handschiegl process can be found in \"Phantom of the Opera\" (1925), in which Lon Chaney's character can be seen wearing a bright-red cape while the rest of the scene remained monochrome. The scene was toned sepia, and then the cape was painted red, either by stencil or by matrix. Then, a sulfur solution was applied to everything but the dyed parts, turning the sepia into blue tone. The process was named after its inventor, Max Handschiegl. This effect, as well as a missing color sequence, were recreated in 1996 for a Photoplay Productions restoration by computer colorization (see below).\n\nPartial colorization has also been utilized on footage shot in color to enhance commercials and broadcast television to further facilitate the director's artistic vision. As an example, Cerulean Fx provided partial colorization for Dave Matthews Band's music video \"The Space Between\" as well as Outkast's music videos \"Bombs Over Baghdad\" and \"Roses\".\n\nA number of British television shows which were made in color in the early 1970s were wiped for economic reasons, but in some cases black-and-white telerecordings were made for export to countries that did not yet have color television. An example is the BBC's five-part \"Doctor Who\" story \"The Dæmons\". Only one episode survived in color; the rest existed only as black-and-white film recordings. The only known color recording was a poor-quality over-the-air recording of an abridged broadcast in the United States. In the 1990s the BBC colorized the black-and-white copies by adding the color signal from the over-the-air recordings. The result was judged a success by both technicians and fans. In March 2008, it was announced that new technology, which involves detecting color artifacts (\"dot crawl\") in high-resolution scans of black-and-white films, will be used to restore other \"Who\" episodes as well as shows like \"Steptoe and Son\" where some episodes originally produced in color only exist in black-and-white. However, there are no plans to use colorization on BBC programmes originally \"produced\" in black-and-white, such as the 1960s \"Who\" episodes since they have no color information available and so cannot be recovered using these methods.\n\nColorization is also sometimes used on historical stock footage in color movies. For instance, the film \"Thirteen Days\" uses colorized news footage from the time of the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.\n\nThe full-color feature film \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" (2004), which already made heavy use of digitally generated sets and objects, integrated black-and-white 1940s footage of Sir Laurence Olivier into scenes by colorizing him.\n\nIn his feature film, \"The Aviator\" (2005), Martin Scorsese seamlessly blended colorized stock footage of the \"Hell's Angels\" movie premiere with footage of the premiere's re-enactment. The colorization by Legend Films was designed to look like normal three-strip film but was then color corrected to match the two-strip look of the premiere's re-enactment. Also in \"The Aviator\", Scorsese used colorized footage of Jane Russell from the original black-and-white film, \"The Outlaw\" and dog fight scenes from \"Hell's Angels\".\n\nIn 1983, Hal Roach Studios became one of the first studios to venture into the business of computerized film colorization. Buying a 50 percent interest in Wilson Markle's Colorization, Inc., it began creating digitally colored versions of some of its films. Roach's \"Topper\" (1937), followed by \"Way Out West\" (1937), became the first black-and-white films to be redistributed in color using the digital colorization process, leading to controversy. Defenders of the process noted that it would allow black-and-white films to have new audiences of people who were not used to the format. Detractors complained (among other reasons) that the process was crude and claimed that even if it were refined, it would not take into account lighting compositions chosen for black-and-white photography which would not necessarily be as effective in color. Figures opposed to the process included Roger Ebert, James Stewart, John Huston, George Lucas and Woody Allen.\n\nCary Grant was reportedly \"very gung-ho with the outcome\" of the colorization of \"Topper\". Director Frank Capra met with Wilson Markle about colorizing the perennial Christmas classic \"It's a Wonderful Life\", \"Meet John Doe\" and \"Lady for a Day\" based on Grant's enthusiasm. Colorization, Inc.'s art director Brian Holmes screened ten minutes of colorized footage from \"It's a Wonderful Life\" to Capra, which led Capra to sign a contract with Colorization, Inc. However, the film was believed to be in the public domain at the time, and as a result Markle and Holmes responded by returning Capra's initial investment, eliminating his financial participation, and refusing outright to allow the director to exercise artistic control over the colorization of his films, leading Capra to join in the campaign against the process.\nIn 1986, Film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert did a special episode of \"Siskel & Ebert\" addressing colorization as \"Hollywood's New Vandalism.\" Siskel explained how networks were unable to show classic black-and-white films in prime-time unless they offer it in color. \"They arrest people who spray subway cars, they lock up people who attack paintings and sculptures in museums, and adding color to black and white films, even if it's only to the tape shown on TV or sold in stores, is vandalism nonetheless.\" Roger Ebert added, \"What was so wrong about black and white movies in the first place? By filming in black and white, movies can sometimes be more dreamlike and elegant and stylized and mysterious. They can add a whole additional dimension to reality, while color sometimes just supplies additional unnecessary information.\"\n\nMedia mogul Ted Turner was once an aggressive proponent of this process, by employing the San Diego firm American Film Technologies. When he told members of the press in July 1988 that he was considering colorizing \"Citizen Kane\", Turner's comments led to an immediate public outcry. In January 1989 the Associated Press reported that two companies were producing color tests of \"Citizen Kane\" for Turner Entertainment. Criticism increased with the AP's report that filmmaker Henry Jaglom remembered that shortly before his death Orson Welles had implored him to protect \"Kane\" from being colorized.\n\nOn February 14, 1989, Turner Entertainment president Roger Mayer announced that work to colorize \"Citizen Kane\" had been stopped:\nOur attorneys looked at the contract between RKO Pictures Inc. and Orson Welles and his production company, Mercury Productions Inc., and, on the basis of their review, we have decided not to proceed with colorization of the movie. … While a court test might uphold our legal right to colorize the film, provisions of the contract could be read to prohibit colorization without permission of the Welles estate.\n\nOne minute of the colorized test footage of \"Citizen Kane\" was included in a special \"Arena\" documentary, \"The Complete Citizen Kane\", produced by the BBC in 1991.\n\nJohn Huston's opposition to the colorization of his work led to a landmark three-year French legal case after his death, sparked by a colorized version of \"The Asphalt Jungle\". His daughter Anjelica Huston successfully used French copyright law to set a binding precedent in 1991 that prevents the distribution or broadcasting in France of any colorized version of a film against the wishes of the original creator or their heirs. Major legislative reaction in the United States was the National Film Preservation Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-446), which prohibits any person from knowingly distributing or exhibiting to the public a film that has been materially altered, or a black and white film that has been colorized and is included in the Registry, unless such films are labeled disclosing specified information. This law also created the National Film Registry.\n\nBecause of the high cost of the process, Turner Entertainment stopped colorizing titles. With the coming of DVD technology, the notion of colorization was once again gaining press. Because the DVD format was more versatile, studios could offer viewers the option to choose between both versions without switching discs, and thus, the release of colorized titles once again seemed profitable. Some companies re-released the older colorized versions from the 1980s—an example of this is the Laurel and Hardy box set being released in the UK.\n\nOther studios, such as Sony Entertainment, commissioned West Wing Studios to colorize several Three Stooges films for DVD release. The studio was given access to the original Columbia Studios props and sets to lend authenticity to the colorized versions.\n\nBoth film and television restoration and colorization is produced by the company Legend Films. Their patented automated process was used to colorize around 100 films between 2003 and 2009. Shirley Temple, Jane Russell, Terry Moore and Ray Harryhausen have worked with the company to colorize either their own films or their personal favorites. Two movies that Legend Films are noted for is the colorization of the exploitation film \"Reefer Madness\", for which certain color schemes were used to create a psychedelic effect in its viewers, and \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\". Recently (2007), Legend Films colorized \"It's a Wonderful Life\" for Paramount Pictures (whose subsidiary, Republic Pictures, had regained control of the copyright in the 1990s) and \"Holiday Inn\" in 2008 for rights holder Universal Pictures.\n\nIn 2004, a classic Indian film, \"Mughal-e-Azam\", was colored for theatrical release all over the world by a company called Indian Academy of Arts and Animation (IAAA) in association with Sankranti Creations. Founder of IAAA and Owner of [Sankranti creations], Rajeev Dwivedi used this technology for the first time in India.\n\nIn 2005, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the first season of \"Bewitched\" on DVD. Because the first season was produced in black-and-white, Sony released two versions of the set: one with the episodes as originally broadcast and a second with the episodes colorized. A year later, the second season of \"Bewitched\" and the first season of \"I Dream of Jeannie\", another show owned by Sony, were released the same way. These releases were colorized by Dynacs Digital Studios, a Florida-based company with film colorization and animation studios in Patna, India.\n\nColorization has also been used to restore scenes from color films that were cut from the finished product but were preserved in black-and-white. In 2018, the originally intended closing scene to the 1978 film \"Grease\" (in which the lead characters kiss) was added to the film's 40th anniversary release. A challenge that still plagues colorization efforts is the fact that the colorized black-and-white film may not match film shot originally in color; Randal Kleiser, the director of \"Grease\", wanted to edit the scene back into the film but found the colors between the scenes did not match well enough to do so. Kleiser is optimistic that colorization technology will be advanced enough to match true color by 2028, when \"Grease\" reaches its 50th anniversary.\n\nColorization is sometimes used on documentary programmes. \"The Beatles Anthology\" TV show colorizes some footage of the band, such as the performance of \"All You Need Is Love\" from the TV special \"Our World\" (1967). In the documentary this scene begins in its original black-and-white before dissolving into seemingly realistic, psychedelic color. The color design was based on color photographs taken at the same time as the special was shot.\n\nThe documentary series \"World War 1 in Colour\" (2003) was broadcast on television and released on DVD in 2005. There had previously been full-color documentaries about World War II using genuine color footage, but since true color film was not practical for moving pictures at the time of World War I, the series consists of colorized contemporary footage (and photographs). Several documentaries on the Military Channel feature colorized war footage from the Second World War and the Korean War.\n\nThe 1960 Masters Tournament, originally broadcast in black-and-white and recorded on kinescope, was colorized by Legend Films for the documentary \"Jim Nantz Remembers\". This was the first time a major sports event had been re-broadcast using colorization.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's 2018 First World War well-received documentary, \"They Shall Not Grow old\", black and white footage from the trenches was colourized.\n\nThe Greatest Game Ever Played, the 1958 NFL Championship between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants was colorized by Legend Films for ESPN for a sports broadcast special in December 2008.\n\n\n\nFirms specializing in digital colorization:\n\nGene Siskel and Roger Ebert on colorization of black-and-white films, four parts:\n"}

The Romanesque Revival style Opera House is located at 2020 Post Office Street in Galveston's Historic Downtown Cultural Arts District. It was named \"The Official Opera House of Texas\" in 1993 by the 73rd Texas Legislature. It has a seating capacity of 1,040.\n\nIn 1894, Henry Greenwall (often spelled Greenwald) raised $100,000 for construction of The Grand Opera House and Hotel in Galveston. It opened on January 3, 1895 with a live performance of the play, \"The Daughters of Eve\".\n\nThe Grand has stood through notable hurricanes, including the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Galveston Hurricane of 1915, Hurricane Carla, and Hurricane Ike. The Grand began as a major, live performing arts theatre but after passing through a Vaudeville phase, it slowly evolved into a movie house. The movie house closed in 1974 and was purchased the same year by the Galveston County Cultural Arts Council. They transformed the movie house back into a theatre and then renovated and restored it to its former beauty. The restoration included volunteer efforts and support from private foundations. The theatre was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as \"1894 Grand Opera House\" in 1974. The Galveston County Cultural Arts Council owned the Opera House until 1986, when it became a stand-alone organization known as 1894, Inc. Maureen M. Patton is The Grand's Executive Director, having served as Director under the Arts Council beginning in 1981. Hurricane Ike hit Galveston Island on September 13, 2008, but The Grand was reopened on January 3, 2009 on its 114th anniversary. All of the damage that the hurricane and the flood had caused was repaired with only 92 days of construction.\n\nThe Grand also has been the presenter of several premieres: \"Red White & Tuna\" and \"Tuna Does Vegas\", two of four comedic plays written and performed by \"Greater Tuna\" creators, Jaston Williams and Joe Sears; and \"ANN\", a one-woman play about the life of Texas Governor Ann Richards, written and performed by Holland Taylor.\n\n\"When it opened in 1895, the 70' x 37' x 69' stage was THE LARGEST IN THE STATE OF TEXAS and one of the largest in the country... Even today, a stage whisper can be heard without a microphone, and no seat is more than 70 feet from the stage.\"\n\nThe Grand has been through natural disasters, such as fires and hurricanes, as well as neglect during its time as a movie house. It has been rebuilt and remodeled more than once, such as during the devastating Galveston Hurricane of 1900, when its rear wall and roof caved in.\n\nThe front wall of the building is made of red stone, brick, and terra cotta; the large, glass doors are framed by a carved, Romanesque style stone arch. Inside, the glass box office sits in between the two sets of doors. The carpet is a historic pattern of colors found in the decorative curtain and stenciling of roses and scrolls on the ceiling and boxes. The floors are marble tile, and the walls are wainscot. The banisters and railings are of long leaf red-heart pine, like the wainscot. A large, bronze statue of a woman holding a torch stands on the newel post on The Grand staircase. Inside the theater auditorium, red, velvet curtains frame the stage and eight opera boxes. Blue velour lines the chairs. The stage curtain (originally painted by architect Frank Cox) is a replication of the original, depicting “Sappho and Companions”.\n\n\n"}

Hunt's performance in \"The Sessions\" garnered her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She made her directorial debut with the comedy-drama film \"Then She Found Me\" (2007). Hunt has also won four Golden Globe Awards and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nHelen Hunt was born in Culver City, California. Her mother, Jane Elizabeth (née Novis), worked as a photographer, and her father, Gordon Hunt, was a film, voice and stage director and acting coach. Her uncle, Peter H. Hunt, is also a director. Her maternal grandmother, Dorothy (Anderson) Fries, was a voice coach. Hunt's paternal grandmother was from a German-Jewish family, while Hunt's other grandparents were of English descent (her maternal grandfather was born in England), with a Methodist religious background. When she was three, Hunt's family moved to New York City, where her father directed theatre and Hunt attended plays as a child several times a week. Hunt studied ballet, and briefly attended UCLA.\n\nHunt began working as a child actress in the 1970s. Her early roles included an appearance as Murray Slaughter's daughter on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", alongside Lindsay Wagner in an episode of \"The Bionic Woman\", an appearance in an episode of \"Ark II\" called \"Omega\", and a regular role in the television series \"The Swiss Family Robinson\". She appeared as a marijuana-smoking classmate on an episode of \"The Facts of Life\". Hunt also played a young woman who, while on PCP, jumps out of a second-story window, in a 1982 TV movie called \"Desperate Lives\" (a scene which she mocked during a \"Saturday Night Live\" monologue in 1994). That same year, Hunt was cast on the ABC sitcom \"It Takes Two\", which lasted a single season. She played Jennie in the 1983 television movie \"\", co-starring Mickey Rooney and, later that year, was cast in the lead role of Tami Maida in the fact-based TV movie \"Quarterback Princess\".

For the last year of the show she and Paul Reiser became the first actors ever to be paid $1,000,000 per episode. Hunt directed several episodes of \"Mad About You\", including the series finale. Her big-screen directorial debut came with the film \"Then She Found Me\", in which she also starred, with Colin Firth and Matthew Broderick. She played the love interest of Moe Szyslak on The Simpsons episode Dumbbell Indemnity. She starred with Bill Paxton in the 1996 disaster action film \"Twister\", which was the second-highest-grossing film of the year. In 1998, Hunt won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the movie \"As Good as It Gets\" of a waitress and single mother who finds herself falling in love with a misanthropic obsessive-compulsive romance novelist played by Jack Nicholson. After winning the Academy Award, she took time off from movie work to play Viola in Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\", at Lincoln Center in New York. In 2000, Hunt starred in four films: \"Dr. T & the Women\", with Richard Gere; \"Pay It Forward\", with Kevin Spacey and Haley Joel Osment; \"What Women Want\", with Mel Gibson; and \"Cast Away\", with Tom Hanks.

Macy in \"The Sessions\" as sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene. The movie and her performance were very well reviewed and earned her several award nominations, including an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. The movie also gained two awards at the Sundance Film Festival. The role required Hunt to perform multiple scenes of full-frontal nudity. Hunt further said: \"\"Being naked was challenging, but even more than that was the vulnerability. I felt vulnerable because I was naked. I felt vulnerable because we were having such a vulnerable moment in this character's life. This was a real journey that someone had gone on, and I wanted to do right by that.\"\n\nShe owns a production company with Connie Tavel, Hunt/Tavel Productions under Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nHunt started dating actor Hank Azaria in 1994. They married in 1999, and divorced 17 months later. She was partnered with producer/writer/director Matthew Carnahan starting in 2001.

Lewis (born 5 February 1937) is a British businessman and investor, who currently lives in New Providence in the Bahamas.\n\nLewis' total wealth is estimated at $US5 billion, and he is listed as the 388th richest person in \"Forbes\"’ 2018 list of billionaires. Forbes reported that Lewis is the 12th wealthiest person in the UK, .\n\nLewis was born to a Jewish family above a public house in Roman Road, Bow, London. Lewis left school at 15 to help run his father's West End catering business, Tavistock Banqueting. When he took the reins, he quickly expanded it by selling luxury goods to American tourists, and also owned West End club the Hanover Grand, where he gave Robert Earl his first job. He later sold the business in 1979 to make his initial wealth.\n\nAfter selling the family business in the late 1970s, Lewis moved into currency trading in the 1980s and 1990s, resulting in his move to the Bahamas where he is now a tax exile. In September 1992, Lewis teamed up with George Soros to bet on the pound crashing out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The event, which was dubbed Black Wednesday, made Lewis very wealthy, and some say he made more than Soros. Lewis is still an active foreign exchange trader.\n\nLewis is the main investor in Tavistock Group, which owns more than 200 companies in 15 countries. Tavistock Group's portfolio includes:\n\nLewis hosts the Tavistock Cup tournament every March in Florida, raising millions of dollars for charity, and owns three of the four clubs that compete: Albany, Lake Nona Golf & Country Club and Isleworth Golf & Country Club. Lewis built a golf community in the Bahamas called Albany, which opened in October 2010. Tiger Woods and Ernie Els are also major shareholders in the luxury resort community located in New Providence. Lewis made a £70 million investment in Bulgarian property development.\n\nLewis seeded Lake Nona, covering 7,000 acres next to Orlando’s international airport, with $100 million in gifts and land which was cultivated into a large-scale community offering research and educational facilities, hospitals for veterans and children, a town center, and a range of workspaces and residential options.\n\nSince Lewis bought a property in Río Negro Province, Argentina, public access to Escondido lake has been under discussion. The Argentine law asserts that every water course is public and of free access. In 2009 Lewis was ordered by the Superior Tribunal de Justicia (STJ) to create and keep access to the lake, with \"sufficient signage and to keep it transitable\", but the ruling has not been enforced. Lewis' frontman Van Ditmer stated: \"We are going to defend the private property with the Winchester in the hands; with blood if needed\".\n\nLewis' property encircles the lake. While some have called for another public mountain trail to be built to access the lake, El Consejo de Ecología y Medio Ambiente de Río Negro (the Council of Ecology and Environment of Río Negro) does not support building another pass, which would cause harm to the environmentally protected area.\n\nHe is currently planning to use a huge protected area, 4 times the size of the city of Buenos Aires, for another private development, against the wishes of the locals. The property was bought for 69 pesos per hectare, currently about $4 USD. This low price was secured by using the name of a local 'poblador' on the deed, after which it was transferred to him. It is suggested that the Hidden Lake property is needed to supply water and (hydraulic) energy to this new property, dubbed the private state in Patagonia. In January 2017, new mass protests have started in El Bolson against this project.\n\nOn 10 September 2007, Lewis paid US$860.4 million in an all-cash purchase of a 7% stake in Bear Stearns. By December 2007 Lewis had raised his stake at the brokerage firm to 9.4%, a total of 11 million shares, for which he paid an average price of $107 apiece. After the purchase of Bear Stearns by JP Morgan for $10 a share, it was estimated that Lewis lost $1.16 billion on his investment.\n\nLewis is the largest shareholder in the British public house group Mitchells & Butlers, controlling 26.85% of the issued share capital through his investment vehicle Piedmont, which he built up since 2008. It was reported on 27 August 2011 that Lewis had made a zero premium proposal for the pub group of 224p a share. He later revealed on 12 September 2011 that he was considering raising his earlier offer to 230p a share, a 4.5% premium. However, independent M&B board members rejected the offer as \"significantly undervaluing\" the business.\n\nLewis has been married twice. \nHis first marriage to Esther Browne ended in divorce. They had two children: \nVivienne Lewis Silverton is seen as his \"heir\" and serves on Tavistock's board of directors. She is divorced from Toby Silverton, the former chairman of Bristol Cars, once fully owned by Tavistock.\nCharles Lewis lives in Argentina, Lewis is now married to Jane Lewis.\n\nLewis' art collection is estimated to be worth $1 billion, includes works by Picasso, Matisse, Lucian Freud and sculptor Henry Moore. Lewis bought Francis Bacon's \"Triptych 1974–1977\" in 2008 for £26.3 million, then a record for postwar artwork bought in Europe. In November 2018 Joe Lewis sold his \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" by David Hockney in Christie's salesroom for $90.3 million.\n\nJoe Lewis is currently the owner of Arturo Di Modica's iconic Charging Bull which the artist installed during the middle of the night on 15th December 1989 on Wall Street with no prior permission from the authorities. \n\n"}

Andrew McMurty of \"Filmink\" stated, \"Ultimately, Part of Me is for fans, but it should have interest for people interested in celebrity culture\".\n\nNegative reviews included Mark Olsen of \"Boxoffice Magazine\"'s claim that, \"this supposedly honest behind-the-scenes look at Perry's 2011 world tour often feels more like sharp brand management\". Alison Willmore of \"Time Out New York\" also gave the film a generally negative review, saying, \"the 3-D performance footage is impressively lavish, though the film's unending idolization of the amiable singer will quickly exhaust all but the most devoted fans\".\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film grossed $7,138,266 in 2,730 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #8 at the box office. \"Katy Perry: Part of Me\" has grossed $25,326,071 domestically and $7,400,885 internationally, totaling $32,726,956 worldwide.

In the mid-1850s he worked for local architect Albert C. Nash, where he first met Bunnell. About 1855 he established himself as an architect. In 1858 Bunnell was briefly a draftsman in his office, but then lived in North Carolina for two years. In 1860 Bunnell returned, and the two formed a partnership, Lambert & Bunnell. They remained associated until Lambert fell ill in 1901.\n\nRufus William Bunnell was born in Bridgeport on February 11, 1835. He attended the public schools. He began his architectural training in 1852 with Chauncey Graham, a local builder-architect. In 1854 he entered the office of Bridgeport architect Albert C. Nash, where he and Lambert met. The following year he went to Trenton, New Jersey to work for Graham, who had reestablished his office there. After a few months he went to Toledo, Ohio, to work for Frank J. Scott. In 1857-58 he worked briefly for Woollett & Ogden in Albany, and for Lambert in Bridgeport. In 1858 he went south to Wilmington, North Carolina for be the designer for James F. Post, a builder. For Post he worked on the Bellamy Mansion in Wilmington, begun 1859. In 1860 he returned to Bridgeport, establishing his partnership with Lambert. He was with the Union Army from 1862-1863, but otherwise remained associated with Lambert until 1901. After Lambert fell ill that year, the partnership was dissolved and Bunnell worked from his home in Stratford. He died in 1909.\n"}

{"id": "20564760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20564760", "title": "Miracle of the roses", "text": "Miracle of the roses\n\nA miracle of the roses is a miracle in which roses manifest an activity of God or of a saint. Such a miracle is presented in various hagiographies and legends in different forms, and it occurs in connection with diverse individuals such as Saints Elizabeth of Hungary (1207–1231), Elizabeth of Portugal (1271–1336), St. Dorothy, a 4th-century virgin martyr at Caesarea in Cappadocia (died ca. 311), and Our Lady of Guadalupe (appeared in 1531).\n\nIn the Latin West the symbolism of the rose is of Greco-Roman heritage but influenced by and finally transformed through Latin biblical and liturgical texts. In Greco-Roman culture the rose's symbolic qualities represented beauty, the season of spring, and love. It also spoke of the fleetness of life, and therefore of death. In Rome the feast called \"Rosalia\" was a feast of the dead: thus the flower referred to the next world.\n\nThis symbolism attained a deeper complexity when contrasted with the rose's thorns. This contrast inspired the Christian Latin poet Coelius Sedulius, who wrote (between 430-450) a very elaborate comparison between Eve, our first mother, and Mary, the Mother of Jesus our Savior. He illustrated the parallelism already made by Justin Martyr (around 150) and developed it in a deep poetic and doctrinal liturgical teaching in his Easter song, \"Carmen paschal\".\n\nThe rose was a privileged symbol for Mary, Queen of heaven and earth. We see this development later during the Middle Ages, when the rose became an attribute of many other holy women, including Elizabeth of Hungary, Elizabeth of Portugal, Casilda of Toledo, and for the martyrs in general. The rose is even a symbol for Christ himself, as seen in the German Christmas song, \"es ist ein 'Rose' entsprungen.\"\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the rose was cultivated in monastery gardens and used for medicinal purposes. It became a symbol in religious writing and iconography in different images and settings, to invoke a variety of intellectual and emotional responses. The mystic rose appears in Dante's \"Divine Comedy\", where it represents God's love. By the twelfth century, the red rose had come to represent Christ's passion, and the blood of the martyrs.\n\nThe most common association of the rose is with the Virgin Mary. The third-century Saint Ambrose believed that there were roses in the Garden of Eden, initially without thorns, but which became thorny after the fall, and came to symbolize Original Sin itself. Thus the Blessed Virgin is often referred to as the 'rose without thorns', since she was immaculately conceived. Saint Bernard of Clairvaux compared her virginity to a white rose and her charity to a red rose. With the rise of Marian devotion and the Gothic cathedral in the twelfth century, the image of the rose became even more prominent in religious life. Cathedrals built around this time usually include a rose window, dedicated to the Virgin, at the end of a transept or above the entrance. The thirteenth century Saint Dominic is credited with the institution of the Rosary, a series of prayers to the Virgin, symbolized by garlands of roses worn in Heaven.\n\nIn Western Europe, the best-known version of a miracle of the roses concerns Saint Elizabeth of Hungary (also called Elisabeth of Thuringia), the daughter of King Andrew II of Hungary, who spent most of her life living with her in-laws in Germany (a ruling family of Thuringia), who kept court at Wartburg Castle.\n\nIt has been suggested that the legend originated in a sermon given by Caesarius of Heisterbach in which he reflects on the occasion of the translation of the remains of Saint Elizabeth, in 1236. Caesarius speaks of a sweet aroma that emanates from the grave as soon as it is opened (a common theme in hagiography). This metaphorical or actual aroma could have been translated into a physical event, the miracle of the roses.\nThe first report of a miracle resembling that of the roses is by Franciscans in the mid-13th century. Their account is of spring flowers, and the event takes place in Hungary, at Elizabeth's home when she was five years old. The miracle as we know it, with roses and in Germany, is first reported in 1332, in a Franciscan book of prayers, though it has also been proposed that the miracle was \"translated\" from Elizabeth of Portugal to Elisabeth of Hungary in the 19th century.\n\nIn its most characteristic form the legend goes as follows. One day the young but pious Elizabeth, in the company of one or more serving women, descends from Wartburg Castle down to the village of Eisenach, below the castle. She is carrying meat, eggs, and bread under her mantle. Supposedly she has taken items from the family dining table to distribute to the poor in the village, against the wishes of her family, who frown upon such behavior. Halfway down, she unexpectedly meets her husband Ludwig IV of Thuringia, who asks, upon seeing her bulk, what she is carrying. Embarrassed and speechless as she is, she does not know what to say. Ludwig opens her mantle, and to his surprise (in some versions this takes place in the dead of winter) finds her carrying a bouquet of roses.\n\nVery much the same story is told of Elizabeth of Portugal, also known as Elizabeth of Aragon (1271–4 July 1336), who was the great-niece of Elizabeth of Hungary. Married to the profligate King Denis of Portugal, she, like her great-aunt, showed great devotion at an early age, and likewise was charitable toward the poor, against the wishes of her husband. Caught one day by her husband, while carrying bread in her apron, the food was turned into roses. Since this occurred in January, King Denis reportedly had no response and let his wife continue. The story is somewhat apocryphal; while it shows up in popular versions of the saint's life, the account is missing from more authoritative sources such as the revised 1991 edition of Alban Butler's \"Lives of the Saints\".\n\nSimilar also is the legend of Casilda of Toledo (died c. 1050), a daughter of a Muslim king of Toledo, Spain during the rule of the Caliphate, who showed special kindness to Christian prisoners. She would carry bread hidden in her clothes to feed these prisoners; one day, when caught, the bread was miraculously changed into roses. In the famous painting of Saint Casilda by the 17th-century painter Francisco Zurbarán, roses are visible in the saint's lap; the miracle is also depicted in a painting by the 19th-century painter Jose Nogales. But while Saint Casilda supposedly died in the 11th century, predating the birth of both Elizabeth of Hungary and Elizabeth of Portugal, her hagiography was not written until three centuries after her death, and is likely influenced by the legend of one of these Elizabeths.\n\nOf the 15th-century Franciscan St. Didacus of Alcalá, also known as San Diego, the same miracle is told: as a lay brother of the Franciscans in Spain, he often took bread from the monastery's dining table to give to the poor. One day, leaving the convent with a cloak full of food, he was accused and challenged to open his cloak; miraculously, the loaves of bread had changed into roses.\n\nThe story of Our Lady of Guadalupe is of an entirely different character, although here again the miraculous presence of the roses in the middle of winter is a sign of the presence of the divinity. The account is a corollary to a Marian apparition, Our Lady of Guadalupe, found in the 1556 booklet Nican Mopohua, and supposedly taking place in 1531. It concerns a native inhabitant of Mexico named Juan Diego, whom the Virgin chooses to convey a message to an unwilling bishop, that \"Here I will hear their weeping, their sorrow and will remedy and alleviate all their multiple sufferings, necessities and misfortunes.\" The bishop however, does not believe Diego's story. He returns to his field, where again the Virgin appears to him, with the same message. Diego again goes to the bishop, with the same result, and the remark that he has to bring a token if he is to be believed. The fourth time the Virgin appears, she directs Diego toward \"varied Castilian flowers\" which he picks; she then places the flowers in his mantle. (The identification of these flowers as Castilian roses or Damask roses, is a later addition.) This time the bishop is convinced, especially when an image of the Virgin miraculously appears on Diego's cloak.\n\nA miracle involving roses occurred to Saint Rita of Cascia. The winter before the end of her life, a cousin visited her and asked her if she desired anything from her old home at Roccaporena. Saint Rita responded by asking for a rose and a fig from the garden. It was January and her cousin did not expect to find anything due to the snowy weather. However, when her relative went to the house, a single blooming rose was found in the garden, as well as a fully ripened and edible fig. Her cousin brought the rose and fig back to Saint Rita at the convent, who thanked her and gave the rose to her sisters.\n\nThe rose is thought to represent God's love for Rita and Rita's ability to intercede on behalf of lost causes or impossible cases. Rita is often depicted holding roses or with roses nearby, and on her feast day, churches and shrines of Saint Rita provide roses to the congregation that are blessed by priests during Mass.\n\nOn the occasion of the centenary of the canonization of Saint Rita of Cascia, Pope John Paul II stated that the worldwide devotion to Saint Rita is symbolized by the rose, and said: \"It is to be hoped that the life of everyone devoted to her will be like the rose picked in the garden of Roccaporena the winter before the saint's death. That is, let it be a life sustained by passionate love for the Lord Jesus; a life capable of responding to suffering and to thorns with forgiveness and the total gift of self, in order to spread everywhere the good odour of Christ (cf. ) through a consistently lived proclamation of the Gospel.\" He added that Saint Rita spiritually offers her rose to each of those he addressed as an exhortation to \"live as witnesses to a hope that never disappoints and as missionaries of a life that conquers death\".\n\n"}

{"id": "9724768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9724768", "title": "Nantgarw China Works", "text": "Nantgarw China Works\n\nThe Nantgarw China Works was a porcelain factory, later making other types of pottery, located in Nantgarw on the eastern bank of the Glamorganshire Canal, north of Cardiff in the River Taff valley, Glamorganshire, Wales. \nThe factory made porcelain of very high quality, especially in the years from 1813-1814 and 1817-1820. The body was extremely white and translucent, and was given overglaze decoration of high quality, mostly in London or elsewhere rather than at the factory. The wares were expensive, and mostly distributed through the London dealers. Plates were much the most common shapes made, and the decoration was typically of garlands of flowers in a profusion of colours, the speciality of the founder, William Billingsley. With Swansea porcelain, Nantgarw was one of the last factories to make soft-paste porcelain, when English factories had switched to bone china, and continental and Asian ones continued to make hard-paste porcelain. \n\nThe history of the ownership and management of the factory is complicated. The first formula, used in 1813-14, gave excellent results, but had an unacceptably high wastage rate, being very prone to deform (\"slump\") during firing. This formula was also being used at Swansea, and pieces can be impossible to allocate between the two with confidence. After a period of experimentation, in 1817-1820 the original paste formula was used again. \n\nAfter ceasing to make or decorate porcelain in the 1820s, and a period of closure, the pottery reopened in 1833, making earthenware and stoneware, as well as clay pipes, before finally closing in 1920, when cigarettes had replaced pipes. The site is now a museum, and also a working pottery. In 2017 a limited quantity of porcelain was made there, using the original formula, as reconstructed. \n\nEstablished in November 1813, when artist and potter William Billingsley and his son-in-law Samuel Walker, a skilled technician, rented \"Nantgarw House\" on the eastern bank of the Glamorganshire Canal, eight miles north of Cardiff in the Taff Valley, Glamorganshire, Wales, and set about building the kilns and ancillary equipment in its grounds, necessary to transform the building into a small porcelain pottery.\nBillingsley had been instrumental in the development of the porcelain recipe for \"Flight, Barr & Barr\" at Royal Worcester, he and Walker, had signed an agreement not to disclose their new porcelain recipe to a third party, but there was no clause preventing them from using that recipe themselves. They had left Worcester in secret and started the venture at Nantgarw with only £250 to invest in the project between them. By January 1814, the Quaker entrepreneur William Weston Young had already become the major share-holder in their venture, having invested £630 into the first production period at Nantgarw, as his diaries at the Glamorgan Record Office testify, where payments are recorded to a \"Mr \"Bealey;\"\" an alias Billingsley travelled under since leaving Royal Worcester.\n\nIt is assumed Young was acquainted with Billingsley through a mutual friend, and fellow earthenware decorator Thomas Pardoe, whom Billingsley had approached at Swansea's Cambrian Pottery, while seeking employment in 1807. Young's work across Glamorganshire as a surveyor may have put him in the position to advise Billingsley whilst still at Royal Worcester, of the suitability of the site at Nantgarw. Its proximity to the Glamorganshire Canal enabled heavy shipments of china clay, as well as the pottery's delicate porcelain wares to be smoothly transported to and from Cardiff docks by barges.\n\nWith the pottery established, Billingsley sought to produce a \"soft paste\" porcelain. Nantgarw porcelain was made to Billingsley's secret formula. Bones, burnt and mixed with clay, were ground by miller David Jones in a mill adjoining the Cross Keys public house, in the village. The water wheel was powered by a leat running from the canal to the River Taff. The high temperature needed to produce perfect pieces made Billingsley soft paste method difficult to fire. The vast majority of the pieces warped or shattered in the firing process. The resources of the three associates soon ran out and the group approached the British Government's \"Committee of Trade and Plantations\" (The Board of Trade), requesting a grant of £500, referring to the subsidy afforded to the famous Sèvres Porcelain Factory by the French Government. They were not successful, but one member of the committee, porcelain enthusiast Sir Joseph Banks, suggested his friend and potter Lewis Weston Dillwyn of the Cambrian Pottery of Swansea, Glamorganshire, should make an inspection and report on the matter.\n\nDillwyn made the inspection, observing that 90% of the porcelain was ruined in the firing, but was so impressed with the quality of the surviving pieces that he invited Billingsley and Walker to use his facilities at the Cambrian Pottery to improve their recipe and process. An annexe was built for porcelain production at the Cambrian Pottery, where Walker and Billingsley were based from late 1814. The recipe was modified and improved, but was still wasteful enough for Dillwyn to abandon the project in 1817, when the pair returned to Nantgarw. Royal Worcester's attempts to sue Dillwyn, Billingsley & Walker for breach of contract was a further reason for Dillwyn to cease porcelain production at the Cambrian Pottery. The contract signed at Royal Worcester prevented the recipe being disclosed to a third party, which superficially, \"Flight, Barr & Barr\" could not prove. However, when Dilwyn's notebooks were interred at the V&A Museum, South Kensington, London in 1920; Bilingsley's recipe was found, but had never used in Billingsley's absence.\nIn the second phase of production at Nantgarw, Young invested a further £1,100 in the pottery as well as mustering a further £1,000 from \"ten gentlemen of the county\". Billingsley and Walker continued to fire their porcelain, which by this stage was of the finest quality Billingsley had ever attained but still at a loss until one day in April 1820, while Young was away in Bristol, the pair absconded to Coalport leaving behind them the lease to the pottery and several thousand pieces of undecorated porcelain in various stages of production (\"in the biscuit and the white\").\n\nYoung put the Nantgarw Pottery and its contents up for sale via public auction in October 1820, enabling him to buy out his minor partners, become sole proprietor and manage the completion and sale of the stock; effectively salvaging the business. He invited his friend and former co-working artist from the Cambrian Pottery, Thomas Pardoe, to aid him with the completion and decoration of the salvaged porcelain. Young and Pardoe experimented to perfect a glaze for the biscuit ware, but were unable to add to Billingsley's stockpile of porcelain, having no access to his recipe. The final sales of the finished porcelain (sold between 1821 and 1822), paid Pardoe and his staff's salaries in arrears, but failed to recoup Young's total losses, leaving Young narrowly avoiding bankruptcy. Besides the porcelain decorated by Young, but predominantly by Pardoe at Nantgarw, many pieces were sold \"in the white\" to be decorated in London. These wares are known to have been decorated by Thomas Martin Randall (working for John Mortlock at the time), John Latham, William Peg and probably Matthew Colclough.\n\nSome Nantgarw porcelain is identified with the mark \"NANTGARW\" impressed, often with the initials C.W. \"(for China Works)\" underneath. The word \"NANTGARW\" in red script is also seen on some of the finer specimens.\n\nIn 1833 William Henry Pardoe, son of Thomas Pardoe, took over the vacant Nantgarw Pottery and began manufacturing stoneware bottles and brown glazed earthenware known as Rockingham ware. He also began manufacturing clay tobacco pipes, many of which were exported to Ireland. The business continued under Pardoe's descendants, and at its peak produced around 10,000 pipes a week, until its closure in 1920, when cigarettes replaced such clay pipes.\n\nCollections of the historic wares can be seen at museums including the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff, the Oriel Plas Glyn-y-Weddw, Llanbedrog, Pwllheli, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nIn 1989 the semi-derelict site was bought by Taff-Ely County Borough Council, who still today own the site. After the start of archaeological excavation and restoration of its kilns and buildings, the site opened it to the public two years later as the Nantgarw China Works and Museum. Closed at the end of 2008 due to budget cuts at Rhondda Cynon Taff council, the Nantgarw Chinaworks Museum was reopened during the week in November 2010 by two artists. The museum is currently (February 2016) used for artists' studios, exhibitions, art classes and special events, and the restoration of the kilns is being completed by the Welsh government. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "453182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=453182", "title": "Neck (water spirit)", "text": "Neck (water spirit)\n\nThe neck, nicor, nixie or nokken (; , ; Danish: \"nøkke;\" ; ; ; ) are shapeshifting water spirits in Germanic mythology and folklore who usually appeared in forms of other creatures.\n\nUnder a variety of names, they were common to the stories of all Germanic peoples, although they are perhaps best known from Scandinavian folklore. The related English \"knucker\" was generally depicted as a wyrm or dragon, although more recent versions depict the spirits in other forms. Their sex, bynames, and various transformations vary geographically. The German and his Scandinavian counterparts were males. The German was a female river mermaid.\n\nThe names are held to derive from Common Germanic \"*nikwus\" or \"*nikwis(i)\", derived from PIE \"\" (\"to wash\"). They are related to Sanskrit , Greek and , and Irish (all meaning to wash or be washed). The form \"neck\" appears in English and Swedish ( or , meaning \"nude\"). The Swedish form is derived from Old Swedish , which corresponds to Old Icelandic ( ), and in Norwegian Nynorsk. In Finnish, the word is . In Old Danish, the form was and in modern Danish and Norwegian Bokmål it is . The Icelandic and Faroese are horselike creatures. In Middle Low German, it was called and in Middle Dutch (compare also or plus ) . The Old High German form also meant \"crocodile\", while the Old English could mean both a \"water monster\" like those encountered by Beowulf, and a \"hippopotamus\". The Norwegian and Swedish are related figures sometimes seen as by-names for the same creature. The southern Scandinavian version can transform himself into a horse-like \"kelpie\", and is called a (the \"brook horse\"), whilst the Welsh version is called the (the \"water horse\").\n\nEnglish folklore contains many creatures with similar characteristics to the \"Nix\" or . These include Jenny Greenteeth, the Shellycoat, the river-hag Peg Powler, the -like Brag, and the Grindylow.\n\nAt Lyminster near Arundel in the English county of Sussex, there are today said to dwell \"water-wyrms\" called knuckers, in a pool called the \"Knucker-hole\". The great Victorian authority Skeat had plausibly suggested the pool's name of \"knucker\" (a name attested from 1835, Horsfield) was likely derived from the Old English , a creature-name found in \"Beowulf\".. Yet the waters at the pool were badly muddied by a local antiquarian named Samuel Evershed, who from 1866 tried assiduously to connect the pool with dragons and thus with the tale of St. George and the Dragon. Any authentic water-sprite folklore the site may originally have had was thus trampled down by Evershed's enthusiastic inculcation of the local people in ideas about water-dragons.\n\nThe Scandinavian \"näcken\", \"näkki\", \"nøkk\" were male water spirits who played enchanted songs on the violin, luring women and children to drown in lakes or streams. However, not all of these spirits were necessarily malevolent; many stories indicate at the very least that nøkker were entirely harmless to their audience and attracted not only women and children, but men as well with their sweet songs. Stories also exist wherein the Fossegrim agreed to live with a human who had fallen in love with him, but many of these stories ended with the nøkk returning to his home, usually a nearby waterfall or brook. (Compare the legend of Llyn y Fan Fach in Wales.) The nøkker were said to grow despondent unless they had free, regular contact with a water source.\n\nThe Norwegian Fossegrim or \"Grim\", Swedish \"strömkarl\", is a related figure who, if properly approached, will teach a musician to play so adeptly \"that the trees dance and waterfalls stop at his music\".\n\nIt is difficult to describe the appearance of the nix, as one of his central attributes was thought to be shapeshifting. Perhaps he did not have any true shape. He could show himself as a man playing the violin in brooks and waterfalls (though often imagined as fair and naked today, in folklore he was more frequently described as wearing more or less elegant clothing) but also could appear to be treasure or various floating objects, or as an animal—most commonly in the form of a \"brook horse\" (see below). The modern Scandinavian names are derived from Old Norse \"nykr\", meaning \"river horse\". Thus, it is likely that the figure of the brook horse preceded the personification of the nix as the \"man in the rapids\". Fossegrim and derivatives were almost always portrayed as especially beautiful young men, whose clothing (or lack thereof) varied widely from story to story.\n\nThe enthralling music of the nøkk was most dangerous to women and children, especially pregnant women and unbaptised children. He was thought to be most active during Midsummer's Night, on Christmas Eve, and on Thursdays. However, these superstitions do not necessarily relate to all the versions listed here. Many, if not all of them, developed after the Christianizing of the northern countries, as was the case of similar stories of faeries and other entities in other areas.\n\nWhen malicious nøkker attempted to carry off people, they could be defeated by calling their name; this was believed to cause their death.\n\nAnother belief was that if a person bought the nøkk a treat of three drops of blood, a black animal, some \"brännvin\" (Scandinavian vodka) or snus (wet snuff) dropped into the water, he would teach his enchanting form of music.\n\nThe nøkk was also an omen for drowning accidents. He would scream at a particular spot in a lake or river, in a way reminiscent of the loon, and on that spot, a fatality would later take place. He was also said to cause drownings, but swimmers could protect themselves against such a fate by throwing a bit of steel into the water.\n\nIn the later Romantic folklore and folklore-inspired stories of the 19th century, the nøkk sings about his loneliness and his longing for salvation, which he purportedly never shall receive, as he is not \"a child of God\". In a poem by Swedish poet E. J. Stagnelius, a little boy pities the fate of the nøkk, and so saves his own life. In the poem, arguably Stagnelius' most famous, the boy says that the Näck (nøkk) will never be a \"child of God\" which brings \"tears to his face\" as he \"never plays again in the silvery brook\". \n\nOn a similar theme, a 19th-century text called \"Brother Fabian's Manuscript\" by Sebastian Evans has this verse:\n\nIn Scandinavia, water lilies are called \"nix roses\" (\"näckrosor/nøkkeroser\"). A tale from the forest of Tiveden relates that a father promised his daughter to a nøkken who offered him great hauls of fish in a time of need; she refused and stabbed herself to death, staining the water lilies red from that time on:\n\nThe bäckahäst or bækhest (translated as \"the brook horse\") is a mythological horse in Scandinavian folklore. It has a close parallel in the Scottish kelpie, and the Welsh Ceffyl Dŵr.\n\nIt was often described as a majestic white horse that would appear near rivers, particularly during foggy weather. Anyone who climbed onto its back would not be able to get off again. The horse would then jump into the river, drowning the rider. The brook horse could also be harnessed and made to plough, either because it was trying to trick a person or because the person had tricked the horse into it. The following tale is a good illustration of the brook horse:\nThe German \"Nix\" and \"Nixe\" (and \"Nixie\") are types of river merman and mermaid who may lure men to drown, like the Scandinavian type, akin to the Celtic Melusine and similar to the Greek Siren. The German epic \"Nibelungenlied\" mentions the Nix in connection with the Danube, as early as 1180 to 1210.\n\nNixes in folklore became water sprites who try to lure people into the water. The males can assume many different shapes, including that of a human, fish, and snake. The females bear the tail of a fish. When they are in human forms, they can be recognised by the wet hem of their clothes. The Nixes are portrayed as malicious in some stories but harmless and friendly in others.\n\nBy the 19th century Jacob Grimm mentions the Nixie to be among the \"water-sprites\" who love music, song and dancing, and says \"Like the sirens, the Nixie by her song draws listening youth to herself, and then into the deep.\" According to Grimm, they can appear human but have the barest hint of animal features: the nix had \"a slit ear\", and the Nixie \"a wet skirt\". Grimm thinks these could symbolise they are \"higher beings\" who could shapeshift to animal form.\n\nOne famous Nixe of recent German folklore, deriving from 19th-century literature, was Lorelei; according to the legend, she sat on the rock at the Rhine which now bears her name, and lured fishermen and boatmen to the dangers of the reefs with the sound of her voice. In Switzerland there is a legend (myth) of a sea-maid or Nixe that lived in Lake Zug (the lake is in the Canton of Zug).\n\n\"The Yellow Fairy Book\" by Andrew Lang includes a story called \"The Nixie of the Mill-Pond\" in which a malevolent spirit that lives in a mill pond strikes a deal with the miller that she will restore his wealth in exchange for his son. This story is taken from the Tales of Grimm.\n\nThe legend of Heer Halewijn, a dangerous lord who lures women to their deaths with a magic song, may have originated with the Nix.\n\nAlternate names (kennings) for the female German Nixe are Rhine maidens () and Lorelei.\n\nIn a fictional depiction, the Rhine maidens are among the protagonists in the four-part Opera \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" by the composer Richard Wagner, based loosely on the nix of the \"Nibelungenlied\".\n\nThe Rhine maidens Wellgunde, Woglinde, and Floßhilde (Flosshilde) belong to a group of characters living in a part of nature free from human influence. Erda and the Norns are also considered a part of this 'hidden' world.\n\nThey are first seen in the first work of the Nibelungen cycle, \"Das Rheingold\", as guardians of the \"Rheingold\", a treasure of gold hidden in the Rhein river. The dwarf Alberich, a Nibelung, is eager to win their favour, but they somewhat cruelly dismiss his flattery. They tell him that only one who is unable to love can win the \"Rheingold\". Thus, Alberich curses love and steals the \"Rheingold\". From the stolen gold he forges a ring of power. Further on in the cycle, the Rhine maidens are seen trying to regain the ring and transform it back into the harmless \"Rheingold\". But no one will return the ring to them; not even the supreme god Wotan, who uses the ring to pay the giants Fasolt and Fafner for building Valhalla, nor the hero Siegfried, when the maidens appear to him in the third act of \"Götterdämmerung\". Eventually Brünnhilde returns it to them at the end of the cycle, when the fires of her funeral pyre cleanse the ring of its curse.\n\nDescendants of German immigrants to Pennsylvania sometimes refer to a mischievous child as being \"nixie\".\n\n\n\n"}

It continued to be found in Orthodox icons (as \"Galaktotrophousa\" in Greek, \"Mlekopitatelnitsa\" in Russian), especially in Russia.\n\nUsage of the depiction seems to have revived with the Cistercian Order in the 12th century, as part of the general upsurge in Marian theology and devotion. Milk was seen as \"processed blood\", and the milk of the Virgin to some extent paralleled the role of the Blood of Christ.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the middle and upper classes usually contracted breastfeeding out to wetnurses, and the depiction of the Nursing Madonna was linked with the Madonna of Humility, a depiction that showed the Virgin in more ordinary clothes than the royal robes shown, for instance, in images of the Coronation of the Virgin, and often seated on the ground. The appearance of a large number of such depictions in Tuscany in the early 14th century was something of a visual revolution for the theology of the time, compared to the Queen of Heaven depictions; they were also popular in Iberia. After the Council of Trent in the mid-16th century, clerical writers discouraged nudity in religious subjects, and the use of the Madonna Lactans iconography began to fade away.\n\nAnother type of depiction, also deprecated after Trent, showed Mary baring her breast in a traditional gesture of female supplication to Christ when asking for mercy for sinners in Deesis or Last Judgement scenes. A good example is the fresco at S. Agostino in San Gimignano, by Benozzo Gozzoli, painted to celebrate the end of the plague. \n\nThe nursing Virgin survived into the Baroque some depictions of the Holy Family, by El Greco for example, and narrative scenes such as the \"Rest on the Flight into Egypt\", for example by Orazio Gentileschi (versions in Birmingham and Vienna).\n\nA variant, known as the Lactation of St Bernard (Lactatio Bernardi in Latin, or simply Lactatio) is based on a miracle or vision concerning St Bernard of Clairvaux where the Virgin sprinkled milk on his lips (in some versions he is awake, praying before an image of the Madonna, in others asleep). In art he usually kneels before a Madonna Lactans, and as Jesus takes a break from feeding, the Virgin squeezes her breast and he is hit with a squirt of milk, often shown travelling an impressive distance. The milk was variously said to have given him wisdom, shown that the Virgin was his mother (and that of mankind generally), or cured an eye infection. In this form the Nursing Madonna survived into Baroque art, and sometimes the Rococo, as in the high altar at Kloster Aldersbach.\n\n"}

These iconic images such as death’s head and the willow and the urn illustrate the simplistic artistry that the period strived towards. Reasoning for this is because after the Reformation, the English Puritans wished for greater purity and distance from the Catholic Church.\n\nThe primary objective was to extol the virtues of paradise and the transformation of the flesh to spirit. There was a distinct shift that emphasized the inappropriateness of scriptural art. The narrative style of England had changed to one of emblems. Puritans were adamantly against attributing human form to spiritual beings such as God, angels, or spirits, so iconography such as death was preferable and did not violate the second commandment.\n\nOur modern view of death and burial recoil from the Puritan’s use of coffins, skulls, shovels, barred teeth, and empty eyes that were typically seen on gravestones. To the Puritans, these were traditional symbols brought from England. Death was to be depicted as the transformation from the flesh to the spiritual realm without the gritty naturalistic detail.\nEarly New England stones have emblems derived from English morality and the baroque style. Later gravestones are simpler and depict the stages between death and new life, where the soul moves from the body.\n\nThough seemingly frightening, the symbol of death in Puritan New England was much closer to depicting the symbolic voyage from life to death. Death is first a winged head, but with careful analysis of gravestones, there is a distinct transformation to the glorification of the soul. Another common depiction of death is a full skeletal body, typically clad with a scythe or the moon and sun in his hands.\n\nThis picture of death was meant to instill the terrors of death. In the corners of a typical stone with this depiction are angels at the top and bats of the underworld at the bottom. The scythe is most often mid swing among flowers symbolizes the flowering of a man’s life cut off by death and time.\n\nA winged death head can be seen to the right and symbolizes the triumph of death. A typical image of death has serrated teeth, “hole eyes,” a thin elongated jaw, and a slash for a mouth. This image has been commonly used since Elizabethan times.\n\nWithin fifty years the depiction of death changes. The death’s head has become crowned, the lower jaw eliminated, and serrations of teeth appear on the upper row, a characteristic carving of the mid-18th century. Particularly, the eyes become more animated—almond shaped and with pupils—seeming more soul-like than deathlike. Extra imagery such as foliage, grapes and vines, and hearts suggest new life through sacraments and Resurrection.\nThis transition cannot be clearly, or easily, seen through the gravestones. The changes are very minute and gradual leaving some stones at a disturbing image in between an empty skull and a lively soul.\n\nTypically seen as a European symbol, the tree of life has been significant since Sumerian times. The Puritans took this symbol and created their own versions. The tree can be interpreted as life in celestial paradise or as the human life; however, during the 18th century the two were used interchangeably by the New Englanders. In the 19th century, the weeping willow made a distinctive entrance.\n\nThe willow suggests a Greek revival in architecture and a shift in emphasis away from the fate of the soul of the deceased, but instead the mourning of those left behind. The urn is a container to hold ashes used by Imperial Roman. Usage of these icons was part of a larger style toward sentimentality in mourning art. This redirected the emotional output of those left behind. Instead of fearing their loved ones damnation, this depiction is much more peaceful. For example, \"Here lies the body of\" is replaced by \"In memory of.\" There was also a transition from slate to marble.\nThe evolution of style of death's head, and urn and willow design is to be found in almost every cemetery in New England. The emblems of death shifted as the societal interpretation of life and hereafter changed from terror to peace.\n\n"}

It was directed by Amit Sharma, written by Sukesh Kumar Nayak, produced by an Ogilvy India branch of Ogilvy & Mather, and published on YouTube on November 13, 2013. \"Reunion\" is about the fictional reunion between two elderly men, Baldev Mehra (Vishwa Mohan Badola) from India and Yusuf (Mysore Shrinivas Sathyu) from Pakistan. They were separated as children during the Partition of India.\n\nIt has had a strong impact in both India and Pakistan, leading to hope for the easing of travel restrictions between the two countries. It went viral and was viewed more than 1.6 million times before officially debuting on television on November 15, 2013.\n\nBaldev Mehra (Vishwa Mohan Badola) is an elderly Hindu man in Delhi, India, and Yusuf (Mysore Shrinivas Sathyu) is an elderly Muslim man in Lahore, Pakistan. One day Baldev shows his granddaughter Suman (Auritra Ghosh) an old, dated photograph of two children. He tells her that it is himself and his best friend Yusuf when they lived in Lahore prior to the Partition of India in 1947. In front of his house there was a park with a gate made in the stone age and each evening he and Yusuf would fly kites there and \"steal\" Jhajariyas from Yusuf's family sweet shop. When Partition came, however, Baldev and his family had to leave for India overnight. Many decades later, Baldev still thinks of Yusuf and misses him.\n\nUsing details of her grandfather's story, Sumon is able to locate Yusuf's sweet shop in Lahore via her laptop and Google. She connects with his grandson Ali (Syed Shabahat Ali) who helps her to plan a surprise visit from Yusuf on Baldev's birthday.\n\n\nAccording to Sukesh Kumar Nayak, Group Creative Director of Ogilvy Mumbai, Google had stated in their brief that \"the only thing they wanted was to see [...] how meaningful the search engine is in real life.\" Nayak also stated that they wanted to make \"the connection between real life and Google, magical.\" \"Reunion\" was filmed \"in different areas in Delhi, including an old Haveli in Connaught Place, Red Fort, India Gate, and a small scene in Lahore, Pakistan.\" Singer Clinton Cerejo composed the music for the spot.\n\n\"The Star (Malaysia)\" notes that \"Reunion\" has \"gone viral online, reflecting demands in the two countries for closer people-to-people ties [...] Internet users left thousands of comments on social networking sites describing how the advert had brought them to tears and renewed their hopes for improved relations between the two neighbours.\" Max Fisher of \"The Washington Post\" states that \"if you are from South Asia, have family from South Asia, or are merely friends on Facebook with someone who has ties to the subcontinent, you've already seen this video posted to social media in the 48 hours since it went up.

{"id": "19133749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19133749", "title": "Rock art of the Djelfa region", "text": "Rock art of the Djelfa region\n\nThe rock art of the Djelfa region in the Ouled Naïl Range (Algeria) consists of prehistoric cave paintings and petroglyphs dating from the Neolithic age which have been recognized since 1914. Following the Saharan Atlas Mountains they follow on from those, to the west, of south Oran (the regions of Figuig, Ain Sefra, El Bayadh, Afalou and Tiaret), to which they are related. Comparable engravings have also been described further to the east, in the Constantine (Algeria) region.\n\nSome of the engravings of the Djelfa region seem to have been known since the 1850s (El Idrissia). Among the best-known, those of Zaccar were discovered in 1907, and Flamand described in 1914 the station of Daïet es Stel. In the mid-1960s the active Djelfa Council of Initiatives undertook to record engravings and paintings, and Father F. de Villaret, who accompanied the visitors, thus made known works from some twenty new stations, notably those of Oued el Hesbaïa and Aïn Naga. In total more than 1,162 engravings have been discovered in the region.\n\nHenri Lhote referred to these engravings in his major work, \"Les Gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais\", which he published in 1970 in the series of the \"Mémoires du Centre de recherches anthropologiques préhistoriques et ethnographiques\" (CRAPE). For him they could not \"be separated archaeologically from those of south Oran, because they show with some variations the same style, the same technical formulae, the same patinations and the same fauna\"(p. 194). It may therefore be possible to analyse them making use of the hypotheses and the classification which he developed. The engravings of the Djelfa region appeared to him like \"foreign works, which are a copying (always of inferior quality) from those of south Oran\", (p. 193), a region which for the author was \"the principal centre of the rock art of the pre-Saharan regions.\" Some belong to the earliest stage of the large-scale Hartebeest school, like \"The Apollo of Ouled Naïl\", others are more recent or indeed (stylistically) more decadent.\n\nRegretting \"the misreading of the importance of the south Algerian rock art\" in the work of Lhote, P. Huard and L. Allard published in 1976 in \"Lybica\" (CRAPE, Algiers) an important study on \"Les figurations rupestres de la région de Djelfa, Sud Algérois.\" The authors therein recorded forty-three numbered sites or stations which are with some exceptions located near the interior or at the edges of a triangle formed on the north by the town of Djelfa, on the south-west by the village of Sidi Makhlouf and on the south-east by the town of Messaad.\n\nAround the road from Djelfa to Laghouat (just south of Sidi Makhlouf) twenty-three stations are shown: no 28 (Zaccar), 38 (Ishak), 39 (Oued el Youhi), 40 (Guelt el Bidha), 30 (Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur), 31 (Sreissir), 32 (Ben Hallouane), 27 (El Gour), 26 (Ben Hadid), 25 (Kheneg Hilal), 24 (Theniet bou Mediouna II), 23 (Theniet bou Mediouna I), 22 (Theniet el Mzab), 21 (Daïet Geklil), 16 (Oued Mergueb), 20 (Djebel Doum), 19 (Safiet el Baroud), 18 (Morhoma), 33 (Oued Remeila), 34 (Rocher des Pigeons \"Pigeon Rock\"), 41 (Oued Cheguieg), 17 (Oued el Hesbaïa), 42 (Ntsila). Three stations are in addition mentioned to the east of Djelfa: no 1 (Feidjet Elleben), 2 (Sidi Abdallah ben Ahmed), 3 (Argoub Ezzemla). Three other sites are found to the west: n° 37 (Chouchet Esnober), 36 (Koreiker), 35 (El Idrissia).\n\nAround the road from Djelfa to Messaad (by Moudjbara) twelve stations follow roughly from north to south: no 29 (Saouiet), 4 (Aïn Mouilha), 5 (Daïet es Stel), 6 (Hadjra Mokhotma north), 7 (Hadjara Mokhotma south), 10 (Safiet Bou Khenan), 9 (Station de l'Autruche \"Ostrich\"), 8 (Daïet el Hamra), 11 (Bou Sekkin), 12 (Aïn Naga), 13(Atef el Ghorab), 14 (Oued Tamdit). To the east of Messad two final stations are named: no 43 (Oued el Bouir) and 15 (Amoura).\n\nThe engravings are located near dwelling sites, shown by the presence of worked flints and debitage, \"stratified in various levels or at the foot of cliffs of reddish sandstone, the patina of which can become nearly black, which run along the djebels or stand at the edges of the oueds.\" They are \"by-and-large arranged in little separate groups\", the monumental friezes or very richly decorated murals like those of Oued el Hesbaïa or Aïn Naga being \"exceptions\".\n\nRecognizing that the engravings of the Djelfa region are \"similar to those of south Oran by subject and technique\", P. Huard and L. Allard judge however that they have a rich cultural content of their own which, notably, show the ancient buffalo as bearers of attributes of the heads, and the fact that almost all the ovines (sheep) are endowed with classic spheroids or horns enclosed in a ring, which are a later stylization of the motif\"(p. 67). According to these authors \"The introduction in the most ancient stage of the south-Oranian of rams with spheroids can hardly tally with the south-Algerian material, where the most accomplished depictions are often associated with men in developed costume, whereas others, associated with cattle, are clearly of a pastoral epoch\" (p. 71).\n\nWhat is more \"The 'bovidian' stage, which would come only in the fourth place in the sequence of the south-Oranian, where it shows a 'decadent' character, is much more developed in the south Algerian.\" Deducing that these evidences \"show that in the two sectors, its origin must certainly be more ancient\", Huard and Allard prefer to speak \"of a pastoral stage of long duration, with cows and sheep\"(p. 71).\n\nIn the stage of Hunters the authors gather the depictions of the large wild fauna: ancient buffalo (or Hartebeest), elephants, rhinoceros, lions, ostriches and human figures.\n\nOf the seventeen buffalo recorded in the region, twelve belong to the large, naturalistic art and are similar to those of the south-Oranian. They are found at Oued el Hesbaïa (frieze of three buffalo, including one of more than two meters), Aïn Naga (two buffalo in procession), at Station de l'Autruche (buffalo of 1.50 meters surmounted by a hollowed disc), Djebel Doum (buffalo of 2.35 meters of which the left horn supports a \"lengthened semi-circular attribute\"), Safiet el Baroud, Hadjra Mokhotma north (buffalo of 2.63 meters, where a human figure seems to touch the horns), Kheneg Hilal (buffalo of 1.20 m.) and Ben Hallouane.\n\nLarge, medium or small, the twenty-two elephants seem to belong to various ages. The largest (1 to 2 m), naturalistic in style, are found at Aïn Naga, Theniet bou Mediouna I, Oued Remeilia, Aïn Mouilha, Oued el Hesbaïa (where the \"elephant panel\", an accumulation of depictions superimposed through the centuries, shows six), Safiet Bou Khenan, Zaccar, Feidjet Elleben and Bou Sekkin.\n\nSeven rhinoceros, of lesser quality and often decadent in style, are recorded at five stations, at Oued Remeila (the oldest), Feidjet Elleben, Bou Sekkin, Aïn Naga, and Oued el Hesbaïa.\n\nNine representations of Hartebeest antelopes (Bubalis alcelaphus boselaphus) are in naturalistic style. The most famous is that of Zaccar, devoured by a lion (1.50 m in length). A similar scene is found at Daïet el Hamra. At Hadjra Mokhotma north, the animal is confined within a circular trap. Other antelope have been engraved at Safiet el Baroud, Theniet el Mzab and Feidjet Elleben. Otherwise there are numerous antelope-type creatures, often much stylized and in small-scale, like those of Sidi Abdallah ben Ahmed and Safiet bou Khenan, related to the style called \"the Tazina School\", found in south-Oran.\n\nEighteen in number, the lions represented can be classed into three groups: \"naturalistic lions in profile, three times shown in hunting scenes\" (Oued el Hesbaïa, Zaccar, Daïet el Hamra, Hadjara Mokhotma north, Oued Remeilia), \"fairly large lions with the stylized head facing and the body in profile\", \"weaker in style and carving method\", \"late by comparison with the south-Oran prototypes\" (Djebel Doum, Kheneg Hilal, Hadjra Mokhotma south), and thirdly the \"smaller felines, lightly drawn and generally late\", \"of mediocre style and carving method\"(pp. 81–85).\n\nThe ostriches, fairly numerous, are (with the exception of the representations at Safiet bou Khenan and at Oued el Hesbaïa) \"generally of a poor quality.\" boars, in a group of three, are on the other hand rare, limited to the stations of El Idrissia (a lost group) and Sreissir.\n\nThe human depictions are forty in number notably at Oued el Hesbaïa, El Gour, Theniet bou Mediouna II, Aïn Naga, Daïet es Stel, Oued Remeilia, Safiet bou Khenan, Hadjra Mokhotma south and Ben Hadid. Authors attribute to them the model of the \"twenty-five characteristic traits of physical or psychic valour of the hunter culture\" which they have identified \"in the Nile area and in various Saharan regions\" (p. 85).\n\nThus they explain the images of men under animal skins, the wearing of false tails and phallic protections, masks, the presence of ithyphallic depictions and of men touching animals (buffalo, antelopes and elephants at Hadjra Mokhotma north, Theniet bou Mediouna II and Bou Sekkin). Among the weapons they record bows, long and curved weapons, clubs, a hatchet and a shield. Several traps are depicted as well as the hands. Thus, \"all the cultural traits of hunters are attested in the Djelfa region, apart from the lasso and the \"spirale\" (?bolas), which are by compensation strongly represented at Tassili in the Oued Djerat sector.\"(p. 93).\n\nSeveral antelopes and cattle carry signs of human appropriation, especially collars. But it is above all about thirty representations of rams which belong rather to the world of shepherds than of hunters, stretching \"through a long period going all the way forward to an advanced stage of domestication\" (p. 97). Eight among them are rams with spheroids, of which five are associated with human figures (Aïn Naga, Daïet es Stel, Oued el Hesbaïa, Saouiet).\n\nIt is in this group that some of the most famous masterpieces of the region are found, such as the Ram of Aïn Naga, about twice natural size, found by Father F. de Villaret and published by the Djelfa Syndicate of Initiative. The animal, which wears a spheroid framed by feathers, a cheek pendant and a collar with chevrons, is led by a man dressed in a loin-cloth with buttons, wearing bracelets, whose hair-do falls across the nape of his neck in three swathes.\n\nOf the other ovines (sc. sheep), sometimes wearing collars, show their horns enclosed in a ring or by discs (only four depictions show only a collar, or appear without attributes). At Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur a group composed of a ram, a ewe and a large bull denotes \"a well established domestication\" (p. 106). Other rams can be seen at Khenneg Hilal, Oued el Hesbaïa, Safiet bou Khenan, Theniet el Mzab, Hadjra Mokhotma and Aïn Naga.\n\nThe rock art of the Djelfa region shows large naturalistic cattle (Zaccar) and sub-naturalistic ones (Bou Sekkin), the others dating from the pastoral era. Their horns are similarly closed into a ring and they sometimes wear devices in segments of a circle, or of textile, which are perhaps means of carrying things (Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur, Teniet el Mzab, Hadjra Mohkotma, Ben Hadid, Bou Sekkin, Safiet bou Khenan and Oued Mergueb).\n\nThe \"pastoral scenes\" often associating men and animals are found at Hadjra Sidi Boubakeur, Hadjra Mohkotma sud, Aïn Mouilha (men with \"bandes molletières\"), Morhoma, Daïet es Stel and Zaccar. Other humanly-signifying depictions, ithyphallic images and women displaying, are found at Safiet bou Khenan, Theniet bou, Mediouna II, and Daïet el Hamra. At Theniet el Mzab there is also found the famous engraving of a man with three-segmented hair style and square shirt-front, and at Aïn Naga that of the \"timid lovers\" in which the man carries an object like a haricot, shield or quiver surmounted by arrows, (as in south Oran at Khreloua), a hairdo or a headpiece with a tuft of hair falling forwards and with three swathes falling over the neck (a detail which one sees again at Aïn Naga and in south Oran) while the woman shows a carefully maintained hair arrangement, held behind with a clip.\n\nOne also finds among the engravings of the Djelfa region hounds and horses of various epochs.\n\nIn addition, three sites with cave paintings are located at Djebel Doum, at the Zaccar south site (several archers, a possibly human figure and tortoises) and at Hadjra Mokhotma south.\n\nIn 1968, elements of a lithic industry belonging to the Capsian were discovered \"in situ\" by D. Grébénart at Aïn Naga and dated to 5500 B.C., plus or minus 220.\n\nNorth Africa enjoyed a fertile climate during the subpluvial era; what is now the Sahara supported a savanna type of ecosystem, with elephant, giraffe, and other grassland and woodland animals now typical of the Sahel region south of the desert. Historian and Africanist Roland Oliver has described the scene as follows:\n\n[In] the highlands of the central Sahara beyond the Libyan desert... in the great massifs of the Tibesti and the Hoggar, the mountaintops, today bare rock, were covered at this period with forests of oak and walnut, lime, alder and elm.

One of the best known paintings of the Skagen Painters, it depicts Krøyer with his wife Marie and his dog Rap strolling on the beach in the moonlight.\n\nThe Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings. P.S. Krøyer arrived there in 1882, quickly becoming the most prominent member of the group.\n\nIn 1895, in a letter to his friend Oscar Björck, Krøyer wrote \"I am also thinking of painting a large portrait of my wife and me together — but for that I shall definitely need good weather, so it won't be this year.\" In fact it was four years later, in the summer of 1899, that he finally created his large painting. Maybe it was in recognition of 10 years of marriage with Marie Triepcke as illustrated in other works of family life at the time as well as in a number of the photographs and sketches he used as a basis for the work.\n\nThe final result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing into the blue moonlight. Even Krøyer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting her on his arm while the closest figure of all is Krøyer's faithful dog, Rap. After Krøyer had worked on the painting throughout the summer, he submitted it to the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1900. It was not very well received there, being criticized as banal. In fact, it presents the blue half-light, a favourite with the Symbolists who believed the twilight hour heralded the coming of death. In 1907, Krøyer conveyed his own feelings about Skagen evenings: \"Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when the sun goes down, when the moon rises up out of the sea, ... with the fishermen standing on the beach and the cutters sailing by with loosened sails ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all.\" A few months after the spring exhibition, Krøyer was admitted to Middelfart Mental Hospital after suffering a nervous breakdown.\n"}

{"id": "1940787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940787", "title": "Taq Bostan", "text": "Taq Bostan\n\nTaq-e Bostan (, ) means \"Arch of the Garden\" or \"Arch made by stone\" is a site with a series of large rock reliefs from the era of Sassanid Empire of Persia (Iran), carved around the 4th century AD.\n\nThis example of Persian Sassanid art is located 5 km from the city center of Kermanshah. It is located in the heart of the Zagros mountains, where it has endured almost 1,700 years of wind and rain. Originally, several sources were visible next to and below the reliefs and arches, some of which are now covered. Sources next to the reliefs still feed a large basin in front of the rock. The site has been turned into an archaeological park and a series of late Sasanian and Islamic column capitals have been brought together (some found at Taq Bostan, others at Bisutun and Kermanshah).\n\nThe carvings, some of the finest and best-preserved examples of Persian sculpture under the Sassanids, include representations of the investitures of Ardashir II (379–383) and Shapur III (383–388). Like other Sassanid symbols, Taq-e Bostan, and its relief patterns accentuate power, religious tendencies, glory, honor, the vastness of the court, game and fighting spirit, festivity, joy, and rejoicing.\n\nSassanid kings chose a beautiful setting for their rock reliefs along an historic Silk Road caravan route waypoint and campground. The reliefs are adjacent a sacred springs that empty into a large reflecting pool at the base of a mountain cliff.\n\nTaq-e Bostan and its rock relief are one of the 30 surviving Sassanid relics of the Zagros mountains. According to Arthur Pope, the founder of Iranian art and archeology Institute in the US, \"art was characteristic of the Iranian people and the gift which they endowed the world with.\"\n\nThe Taq-e Bostan complex comprise a rock relief standing on its own and several more reliefs associated with two rock cut arches. They illustrate the investiture ceremonies of the kings Ardashir II, Shapur II, Shapur III and Khosrau II. They also depict the hunting scenes of Khosrau II.\n\nThe first Taq-e Bostan relief, and apparently the oldest, is a rock relief of the crowning ceremony of Ardashir II (379-383 AD) by his predecessor Shapur II or Ahura Mazda (although even the middle figure is wearing a Sassanian crown, with the balloon-like top/compartment [apparently to hold their hair in], and the figure to his left is the receiver of the ring; so he could not be Ahura Mazda, either). Researchers long debated the identities of the figures in this relief but is now ascertained that Ardashir II receives the beribboned ring - symbol of royal investiture - from his predecessor Shapur II or Ahura Mazda. There may be a deliberate mixture of the iconography of both identities. The two main figures are standing on the fallen Roman emperor Julianus Apostata (361-363 AD). Ardashir played an important role in his defeat during the reign of Shapur II (309-379 AD). Exceptional within Sasanian art is the fact that this is a portrait, based on the image of Julianus Apostata as it appears on Roman coins. Ardashir II was installed as interim ruler, awaiting the coming of age of the royal heir Shapur III (383-388 AD). The fourth figure is the god Mithra who holds a barsum in his hands and stands on a lotus flower. He is the protector of oaths and is witness to this pact. \nLocal beliefs and Persian folk tale interpreted the scene as the victory of the first Sasanian kings on Artabanus IV, the last king of the Parthian dynasty. The Mithra figure became the visual inspiration for representations of the prophet Zoroaster.\n\nThe relief panel is approx. 4.07 m wide and 3.9 m high.\n\nThe smaller arch or iwan (Taq-e Bustan II) has on the upper part of the back wall two Pahlavi inscriptions identifying two royal figures as Shapur II (Shapur the Great) and his son Shapur III. They are shown facing each other. The arch's vestibule measures 6 x 5 x 3.6 meters. It has been suggested as having been built during the reign of Shapur III and some put the date of its completion at 385 AD. However, the royal crown of Shapur III does not agree with those on his coins and is closer to that of his predecessor Ardashir II. It has been argued that the texts represent an usurpation of Ardashir's relief by Shapur III. The translation of the inscriptions follows:\n\nShapur II inscription :\n\nShapur III inscription:\n\nThe figures of the two kings have been carved in low relief, looking at each other. Each figure is ca. 2.97 meters. Shapur II is on the right and Shapur III is on the left. Their hands are placed on a long straight sword which point downwards. The right hand is holding the grip and the left rests on the sheath. Both figures wear loose trousers, necklaces, curled hair, and a pointed beard ending in a ring.\n\nThe three figures on the back wall of the large \"iwan\" are usually considered to represent Khosrow Parviz flanked by Ahura Mazda and Anahita. They are placed above a mounted Persian knight, thought to be Khusrow himself riding his favourite horse, Shabdiz. There is, however, no unanimity about the exact identification of this late Sasanian king. The two attending figures are sometimes considered to be a priest and a priestess, rather than the gods Ahura Mazda and Anahita themselves.\n\nOne of the most impressive reliefs inside the largest grotto or \"ivan\" is the gigantic equestrian figure of the Sassanid king Khosrau II (591-628 CE) mounted on his favorite charger, Shabdiz. Both horse and rider are arrayed in full battle armor.\n\nThe front of the rock-cut arch bears delicately carved patterns showing the tree of life or the sacred tree. Above the arch and located on two opposite sides are figures of two winged women with diadems.\n\nEquestrian relief panel measured on 16.08.07 approx. 7.45m across by 4.25 m high\n\nOn the right and left wall of the arch, there is a picture of the king's hunting measuring 3.8 X 5.7 meters. From the time of Cyrus the Great to the end of Sassanid period, hunting was one of the most favourite activities of Iranian kings. Therefore, scenes of hunting are frequently found next to those of crownings.\n\nThere are two hunting scenes on each side of the ivan. One scene depicts the imperial boar hunt, and in a similar spirit, the other scene shows the king stalking deer. Five elephants flush out the fleeing boars from a marshy lake for the king who stands poised with bow and arrow in hand while being serenaded by female musicians. In the next scene, another boat carries female harpists and shows that the king has killed two large boars. The next boat shows the king standing with a semicircular halo around his head and a loose bow in his hand, meaning the hunt is over. Under this picture, elephants are retrieving the game with their trunks and putting them on their backs. Several episodes of the royal hunt are thus shown at the same time.\n\nThese royal hunting scenes are among the most vivid and highly narrative murals immortalized in stone.\n\nPanel depicting boar hunt measured on 16.08.07 as approx. 6.0 m wide x 4.25 m high\n\nPanel depicting deer hunt measured on 16.08.07 as approx. 5.9 m wide x 4.35 m high\n\nJumping 1300 years in time the upper relief shows the 19th century Qajar Governor in Kermanshah city, Dowlatshah carving a relief in a big arch.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18653450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18653450", "title": "Water Yam (artist's book)", "text": "Water Yam (artist's book)\n\nWater Yam is an artist's book by the American artist George Brecht. Originally published in Germany, June 1963 in a box designed by George Maciunas and typeset by Tomas Schmit, it has been re-published in various countries several times since. It is now considered one of the most influential artworks released by Fluxus, the internationalist avant-garde art movement active predominantly in the 1960s and '70s. The box, sometimes referred to as a \"Fluxbox\" or \"Fluxkit\", contains a large number of small printed cards, containing instructions known as \"event-scores\", or \"fluxscores\". Typically open-ended, these scores, whether performed in public, private or left to the imagination, leave a lot of space for chance and indeterminancy, forcing a large degree of interpretation upon the performers and audience. \n\nIn some cases [event-scores] would arise out of the creation of the object, while in others the object was discovered and Brecht subsequently wrote a score for it, thus highlighting the relationship between language and perception. Or, in the words of the artist, “ensuring that the details of everyday life, the random constellations of objects that surround us, stop going unnoticed.” The event-score was as much a critique of conventional artistic representation as it was a gesture of firm resistance against individual alienation.\n\nThe work is considered an important precursor to conceptual art.\n\nEarly editions of \"Water Yam\" collected around 70 event-scores together, created over a four-year period from 1959 to 1963. Later editions would add extra events (up to about 100), as well as a small flick book \"Nut Bone. A Yamfest Movie\", and white-on-black invitations to contact Brecht via a New York PO Box and arrange 'deliveries and relocations'.\n\nMany of the scores had been used in mail art events between 1961 and '63, occasionally hand-written, typed or hectographed, more usually typeset; often signed neatly at the bottom of the card. When Maciunas collected the scores together the typeset style was kept, but the signatures were removed. The reliance on bullet points (•) separating the performances from their title was a feature that remained consistent throughout the versions. The cards are all different sizes.\n\nThe scores divide roughly into three sections; the earliest ones, 1959–62, describe events intended to be performed (such as \"Solo for Violin, Viola, Cello or Contrabass\" • Polish, July 1962); a second group of scores from '62-63 tend towards describing the temporary creation of assemblages; (such as \"Chair Event\" • on a white chair a grater, tape measure, alphabet, flag, black and spectral colours, April 1962). The third group, also 1962-63, are more personal and abstract; (such as \"Thursday\" • Thursday, March 1963). When originally published, Maciunas decided to emphasize 14 of the more musical scores (such as the famous \"Drip Music\"; A source of dripping water and an empty vessel are arranged so that the water falls into the vessel, January 1962) by printing them on orange cards, whilst the rest (such as \"Keyhole\" •Through either side) were printed on Brecht's more usual plain white card.\n\nBrecht met the artist Robert Watts at Rutgers University in 1957, and through Watts, Allan Kaprow. The three started to meet regularly for lunch at a local branch of Howard Johnson's, New Jersey. After a meeting with John Cage organised by Brecht whilst the latter was in New Jersey hunting mushrooms, the three men started to attend Cage's experimental music composition classes at the New School for Social Research in New York. In the classes, Cage encouraged his students to use chance and games as major elements in the creation of art. \n\n\"George Brecht's understanding of an intimate situation was far greater than mine. I needed more space to really work. But George really came to life in that situation... He became a leader; and immediately he influenced not only me, but everybody else: Jackson Maclow, Higgins, Hansen. George Segal stopped by, and so did Dine, Whitman and Oldenburg.\" Allan Kaprow\n\nInitially writing theatrical scores similar to Kaprow's earliest Happenings, Brecht grew increasingly dissatisfied with the didactic nature of these performances. After performing in one such piece, Cage quipped that he'd \"never felt so controlled before.\" prompting Brecht to pare the scores down to haiku-like statements, leaving space for radically different interpretations each time the piece was performed.\n\nAs well as Cage's constructive criticism, Brecht was becoming increasingly interested in Marcel Duchamp's theories on art, which he'd written about at length in \"Chance-Imagery\", a text written in 1957 but only published in 1966 by the Something Else Press. \n\nIt was only while reading Robert Lebel's 1959 monograph on Duchamp and pondering the consequences of the readymade that Brecht truly understood what he was searching for: Just as the readymade is an object lifted from its mere commodity status by being transported into an art context, the \"event\" would be an act--often a simple one performed daily, such as turning on and off a switch--on which he would cast his spotlight in order to force us to pay attention to it, in order, as the Russian formalists would have said, to \"make it strange\" and \"de-automatize our perception.\"\n\nAn exhibition of Brecht's work held at the Reuben Gallery, October 1959 \"Toward Events: An Arrangement\" clearly pointed the way: The press release stated that 'art is to become actively rather than passively existent, to be enjoyed as an unfolding experience...works, or 'events,' such as The Dome, The Case, The Cabinet, are presented three dimensionally.' The final piece in the jigsaw, combining a Duchampian love of chance with a scientific belief in art as research, was an epiphany Brecht had in 1960, in which he decisively separated the artwork from the control of the artist; \n\n\"In the Spring of 1960 ... waiting for my wife to come from the house, standing behind my English Ford station wagon, the motor running and the left-turn signal blinking, it occurred to me that a truly 'event' piece could be drawn from the situation.\" George Brecht.\n\"Yam\" was a name thought up by Brecht and Watts in late 1962 to act as an umbrella project 'for all manner of immaterial, experimental, as yet unclassified forms of expression.' Specifically intending to provide a platform for 'art that could not be bought,' the earliest \"Yam\" events involved mailing event cards and other objects stamped with the word 'Yam', or variations, to friends. Designed to increase anticipation, the project reached a head with a month-long series of events in May, 1963, in New York, Rutger's University and George Segal's farm. \nThe \"Yam Festival\" was held on a farm in South Brunswick, New Jersey on 19 May 1963 to actions and happenings by artists including Dick Higgins, Allan Kaprow, La Monte Young, and Wolf Vostell.\nThe festival was organised as a wide ranging series of events taking place throughout the month, whose main objective was to bypass traditional gallery outlets, giving artists and 'receivers' greater freedom. Wolf Vostell made here his happening \"TV Burying\".\n\"In all of its formats and strategies Brecht's and Watt's \"Yam Festival\" operated as an alternative to the gallery system, producing \"art\" that could not be bought.\" Julia Robinson\n\nArtists participating in the festival included Alison Knowles, Allan Kaprow, John Cage, Al Hansen, Ay-O, Dick Higgins, La Monte Young, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Ray Johnson. The festival has come to be seen as a proto-fluxus event, involving many of the same artists. \"Yam\" evolved parallel to George Maciunas' \"Fluxfests\", set up with almost identical aims but currently operating only in Europe whilst Maciunas was stationed in Germany. The International Fluxus Festival of the Newest Music (\"Festum Fluxorum\"), 1962–63, would feature the work of artists such as Cage, Raoul Hausmann and Nam June Paik. Brecht's event-scores, including the famous \"Drip Event\", were amongst the pieces Maciunas would perform, along with pieces by Kaprow, Watts, Daniel Spoerri, Robert Filliou, Terry Riley, Emmett Williams, Joseph Beuys, Wolf Vostell and Dick Higgins.\n\nClearly aware of the \"Yam Festival\", Maciunas brought together 73 of Brecht's event-scores whilst working as a free-lance designer for the US army stationed at Ehlhalten near Wiesbaden, and placed them in a box with a fine example of his graphic design pasted onto the cover. Maciunas referred to the box as 'Brecht's complete works' and intended it to be the first in a series compiling works by artists he admired. Few of these intended 'collected works' ever saw the light of day.The use of multiple fonts derived from his interest in experimental typography by Dada figures such as Hugo Ball and Raoul Hausmann, and was to prove crucial in defining a recognisable style for fluxus products. \n\nPublished in spring 1963, the box was designed to be the cheapest and simplest way of disseminating art, and in keeping with Maciunas' beliefs, was neither numbered nor signed, although later editions would be published as limited, numbered editions. The box is the very first \"Fluxkit\", and the only published link between Brecht and Watt's \"Yam Festival\", and Maciunas' \"FluxFests\".\n\nIt has since been re-published a number of times with differing numbers of event-scores, alternate designs on the cover, and housed in various materials, including plastic boxes and wooden ones. It is worth noting that later editions such as the English \"Parrot Impressions\", 1972, or the \"Lebeer Hossmann\" edition, 1986, don't include Maciunas' graphic design, and don't include the word \"Fluxus\" anywhere in or on the work. Ironically, for an object conceived as an \"inexpensive, mass-produced unlimited edition (designed) to erode the cultural status of art and to help to eliminate the artist’s ego.\" and originally sold for $4, early copies are now worth in excess of $1800.\n\n\n"}
