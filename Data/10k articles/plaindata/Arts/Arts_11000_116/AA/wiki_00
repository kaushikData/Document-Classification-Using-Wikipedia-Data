It is either the collective term for ethics and aesthetics, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to value theory and meta-ethics. The term was first used by Paul Lapie, in 1902, and Eduard von Hartmann, in 1908.\n\nAxiology studies mainly two kinds of values: ethics and aesthetics. Ethics investigates the concepts of \"right\" and \"good\" in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of \"beauty\" and \"harmony.\" Formal axiology, the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with mathematical rigor, is exemplified by Robert S. Hartman's science of value.\n\nBetween the 5th and 6th century BC, it was important in Greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. Philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. Socrates believed that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. Socrates' student, Plato furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all. With the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped Christianity. During the medieval period, Thomas Aquinas made the distinction between natural and supernatural (theological) virtues. This concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.\n\n\n\n"}

A candidate is Emperor Henry II (973-1024) who is buried in the cathedral along with Pope Clement II, but he would likely have been depicted with Imperial Regalia. Another possibility is his brother-in-law, king Stephen I of Hungary (975-1038) who stops his horse and looks towards the tomb of Henry. Another theory favours Emperor Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor at the time, who financed much of the rebuilding of the cathedral. Yet another theory, supported by Hannes Möhring of the University of Bayreuth, holds that the figure represents the Messiah according to the Book of Revelation (19:11–16).\n\nIt is considered the first monumental equestrian statue since classical antiquity, and also one of the first to depict a horse shoe. Beneath the horse's front hooves is one of the many sculptural representations of the Green Man. Kathleen Basford, in her study of these figures, calls this Green Man the \"dark counterpart\" of the horseman.\n\nStefan George wrote a poem about the horseman.

{"id": "20703466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20703466", "title": "Champmol", "text": "Champmol\n\nThe Chartreuse de Champmol, formally the \"Chartreuse de la Sainte-Trinité de Champmol\", was a Carthusian monastery on the outskirts of Dijon, which is now in France, but in the 15th century was the capital of the Duchy of Burgundy. The monastery was founded in 1383 by Duke Philip the Bold to provide a dynastic burial place for the Valois Dukes of Burgundy, and operated until it was dissolved in 1791, during the French Revolution. Called \"the grandest project in a reign renowned for extravagance\", it was lavishly enriched with works of art, and the dispersed remnants of its collection remain key to the understanding of the art of the period.\n\nPurchase of the land and quarrying of materials began in 1377, but construction did not begin until 1383, under the architect Druet de Dammartin from Paris, who had previously designed the Duke's chateau at Sluis, and been an assistant in work at the Louvre. According to James Snyder his work at Champmol was \"a somewhat conservative modification of the Late Gothic buildings of Paris\". A committee of councillors from Dijon supervised the construction for the Duke, who was often elsewhere. By 1388 the church was consecrated, and most construction probably completed. The monastery was built for twenty-four choir monks, instead of the usual twelve in a Carthusian house, and two more were endowed to celebrate the birth in 1433 of Charles the Bold. These lived semi-hermitic lives in their individual small houses when not in the chapel. There would also have been non-ordained monks, servants, novices, and other workers.\n\nWhen founded, Champmol was \"two arrow shots\" outside the city gates, but is now inside the modern city boundaries. At this time the city had about 10,000 inhabitants and was the largest in Burgundy proper, though smaller than the cities of the territories in the Netherlands recently inherited by the Duke through his wife. But Burgundy was held more securely than the often turbulent cities in the north, and represented the senior title of the dynasty. Over sixty members of the Capetian House of Burgundy, whom the Valois had succeeded in 1361, only two decades earlier, had been buried at Cîteaux Abbey to the south of Dijon. Champmol was intended to rival Cîteaux, Saint-Denis, where the Kings of France were buried, and other dynastic burial places.\n\nSomewhat in contradiction to the Carthusian mission of tranquil contemplation, visitors and pilgrims were encouraged, the expenses of hospitality recompensed by the Dukes. In 1418 Papal indulgences were granted to those visiting the Well of Moses, further encouraging pilgrims. The ducal family had a private oratory overlooking the church (now destroyed), though their visits were in fact rare. The ducal accounts, which have fortunately survived, show major commissions for paintings and other works to complete the monastery continuing until about 1415, and further works were added after that at a slower rate by the Dukes and other donors.\n\nThe accounts for Champmol have survived in sufficient detail that Martin Warnke synthesized from them a view of the emerging status of court artists, and \"the autonomous consciousness of art and artists\" that would distinguish the world of art in the Early modern period.\n\nThe Valois dynasty of Burgundy had less than a century to run when the monastery was founded, and the number of tombs never approached that of their Capetian predecessors at Cîteaux - indeed there would hardly have been room in the choir of the church, where the monuments were. Only two monuments were ever erected, both in the same style with painted alabaster effigies with lions at their feet and angels with spread wings at their heads. Underneath the slab the effigies rested on, unpainted small (about 40 cm high) \"pleurants\" or mourners (\"weepers\" is the traditional English term) were set among Gothic tracery. These were described by Johan Huizinga in \"The Waning of the Middle Ages\" as \"the most profound expression of mourning known in art, a funeral march in stone\". \nPhilip the Bold died in 1404, and his wife Margaret III, Countess of Flanders the following year. She had decided to rest her remains with those of her parents in Lille, and Philip had been planning a single monument for himself for over twenty years, having commissioned Jean de Marville in 1381. Work did not begin until 1384, and proceeded slowly, with Claus Sluter being put in charge in 1389. At the Duke's death in 1404, only two mourners and the framework were complete; John the Fearless gave Sluter four years to finish the job, but he died after two. His nephew and assistant, Claus de Werve took over and finished the sculptures in 1410. The effigies were painted by Malouel.\n\nJohn expressed a wish for his own tomb, this time a double one with his Duchess Margaret of Bavaria, to resemble that of his father, but nothing was done, even after his death in 1419, until 1435, and in 1439 de Werve died without having managed to find suitable alabaster. In 1443 a Spaniard, Jean de La Huerta, was contracted, and sent drawings for the effigies. He completed most elements, but not the effigies, before leaving Dijon in 1456. Yet another master was brought in, and the monument finally installed in 1470, by which time Philip the Good was himself dead. He seems to have made no provision for a monument for himself, and had initially been buried in Bruges, where he died. His son Charles the Bold had the remains brought back to Champmol after some years, but no monument was ever planned. Charles himself was relocated from Nancy to Bruges by his great-grandson Charles V in 1558.\n\nThe second tomb repeats the design of the first, but with their execution spanning almost a century, stylistic differences can be seen, although some of the \"pleurants\" of the second tomb copy those of the first exactly. It is recorded that Philip the Good had a portrait of himself placed in the choir, where there were already those of the previous two Dukes. None of these are believed to have survived in the original, but surviving portraits may be copies of them.\n\nAfter the Revolution, and the sale of the monastery, the tombs were carefully moved to Dijon Cathedral in 1792, as their historic importance was recognised. But in the following year the cathedral was converted into a Temple of Reason and the effigies were vandalised, so that what are now seen are reconstructions. Many elements, including ten \"pleurants\", were removed by genteel looters.\n\nChampmol was designed as a showpiece, and the artistic contents, now dispersed, represent much of the finest monumental work, as opposed to illuminated manuscripts, of French and Burgundian art of the period. Without the works that remained at Champmol until the 18th century, Claus Sluter, Jacques de Baerze, Melchior Broederlam, Henri Bellechose, Jean Malouel, and Jean de Beaumetz would remain only names known from documentary records.\n\nThere are very important sculptures by Claus Sluter and his workshop on the church portal, including kneeling figures of Philip and his Duchess. The lower parts of the Well of Moses (\"Puits de Moise\") survive, including six life-size figures of the Old Testament prophets who foretold the Messiah, most of the rest having been destroyed, apparently more by weathering than the Revolution.\n\nMost items are in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, including its site in the former palace of the Dukes. The fragments from the Well of Moses and other similar pieces are in the Archaeological Museum. The following are only the main works in Dijon:\n\n\n\nAfter the death in 1477 of Charles the Bold, Burgundy proper was recovered by force by France; the Kings, still descended from the Dukes via the Habsburgs and other routes, continued to support and occasionally visit the monastery. There was slight damage in the siege of Dijon in 1513 and in the French Wars of Religion, but essentially the monastery remained in its 15th-century state until it was decided to update it in the 1770s. The altarpieces of Saints Denis and George had been replaced by new paintings by Charles-André van Loo in 1741; both the new paintings are now in the Dijon museum. Remodelling in the 1770s involved the destruction of some medieval parts, but greater destruction followed the French Revolution. The monastery was suppressed in 1791, and on May 4, five days after the monks departed, the buildings and land were bought by Emmanuel Crétet (1747–1808), later to be Minister of the Interior under Napoleon with the title Comte de Champmol. He destroyed large parts of the buildings and the church. In 1833 the estate was bought by the local département as a mental asylum, and many new buildings erected.\n\nToday the buildings house a psychiatric hospital, and \"aller à la chartreuse\" is a local phrase for developing a mental disorder. The Sluter sculptures can be seen by visitors, and many of the contents are in the Dijon museum, with the tombs and carved retables housed in the former Palace of the Dukes.\n\n\n"}

At this point, theater and music was immensely popular in the colony and frequented by most free people of all races and classes, and public theaters existed in not only Cap-Francais but also in smaller towns such as the theaters of Mlle Marthe and Mlle Francheville in Saint-Marc (1769-1802), Monsieur Passete in Leogane (1760s) and Monsieur Charpentier in Les Cayes (1765-88), and it was considered necessary to have one in the new capital city. \n\nIn 1762, a first theater was managed by the three joint-directors Rouzier, Claude Clement and Charpentier, but it did not last. A permanent theater was finnally established by the theater director Francois Mesplete (d. 1784), who founded the Comédie de Port-au-Prince in 1778. It was a playhouse with room for 750 people. The theater offerred regular performances of drama, opera and music concerts until the Haitian Revolution of 1791, and became an important cultural center. \n\nThe theater employed a stock company of eight actors, eight actresses, eleven musicians, a prompter, a stage manager, a decorator, a tailor, a hairdresser, four porters and a clerk. Francois Mesplete was succeeded in 1784 by Monsieur Acquaire, whose wife the singer-actress Madame Acquaire (previously Mlle Babet) had been a director of the local amateur theater in Gonaive, are known as the mentor of the famous Minette et Lise. Another star attraction of the theater was the violinist Monsieur Petit. \n\nAfter the outbreak of the Haitian Revolution, Acquaire resigned his position as director to Monsieur Blainville and joined his wife in France. Blainville attempted to use the theater as a venue to reconcile the tensions of the colony during the revolution, an attempt which was well received as the activity of the theater was reportedly in full operation right up until the night of the 22 November 1791, when Port-au-Prince was attacked and burnt, during which the theater was among the buildings destroyed. \n\n"}
{"id": "241669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=241669", "title": "Connoisseur", "text": "Connoisseur\n\nA connoisseur (French traditional (pre-1835) spelling of \"connaisseur\", from Middle-French \"connoistre\", then \"connaître\" meaning \"to be acquainted with\" or \"to know somebody/something.\") is a person who has a great deal of knowledge about the fine arts, cuisines, or an expert judge in matters of taste. In many areas the term now has an air of pretension, and may be used in a partly ironic sense, but in the art trade connoisseurship remains a crucial skill for the identification and attribution to individual artists of works by the style and technique, where documentary evidence of provenance is lacking. The situation in the wine trade is similar, for example in assessing the potential for ageing in a young wine through wine tasting.\n\n\"The ability to tell almost instinctively who painted a picture is defined [...] as connoisseurship\". Connoisseurs evaluate works of art on the basis of their experience of the style and technique of artists. Judgment informed by intuition is essential, but it must be grounded in a thorough understanding of the work itself. On the basis of empirical evidence, refinement of perception about technique and form, and a disciplined method of analysis, the responsibility of the connoisseur is to attribute authorship, validate authenticity and appraise quality. These findings are crucial for the valuation of works, and can be collected and organized into a \"catalogue raisonné\" of the work of a single artist or a school.\n\nIn his \"Meaning in the Visual Arts\" (1955), Erwin Panofsky explains the difference between a connoisseur and an art historian: \"The connoisseur might be defined as a laconic art historian, and the art historian as a loquacious connoisseur.\"\n\nThe English dealer and art historian, Philip Mould says, \"it is about noticing things which have specific characteristics of the artists involved, as opposed to general characteristics of the era\". He points out the importance of condition and understanding what the artist originally painted (as opposed to how the painting now looks). His colleague, Bendor Grosvenor takes the view that connoisseurship is learned by looking at paintings and cannot be taught in the classroom. He believes that it has become unfashionable in the world of art history and as a result, activities such as producing a catalogue raisonné are undervalued by the art history establishment. Svetlana Alpers confirms the art historians reservations that the identification of individual style in works is \"essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as conoisseurs\". Nonetheless, Christie's Education offers an MA in the History of Art and the Art Market that includes a seminar on connoisseurship. This covers \"the critical skills needed to look at art, write about art, research and evaluate works, including handling and viewing art objects and visiting artists’ studios, conservation labs and museums.\"\n\nDuring the 18th century, the term was often used as a synonym for a still vaguer man of taste or a pretend critic.\n\nIn 1760, Oliver Goldsmith said, \"Painting is and has been and now will someday become the sole object of fashionable care; the title of connoisseur in that art is at present the safest passport into every fashionable Society; a well timed shrug, an admiring attitude and one or two exotic tones of exclamation are sufficient qualifications for men of low circumstances to curry favour.\"\n\nIn 1890, Giovanni Morelli wrote, \"art connoisseurs say of art historians that they write about what they do not understand; art historians, on their side, disparage the connoisseurs, and only look upon them as the drudges who collect materials for them, but who personally have not the slightest knowledge of the physiology of art.\"\n\nThe attributions of painted pottery were an important project to the History of Ancient Art and Classical Archeology (Ancient Greece and South Italy). Two specialists were the most important authorities in archaeological connoisseurship: John Davidson Beazley (1885-1970) and Arthur Dale Trendall (1909-1995).\n\nConnoisseur is also used in the context of gastronomy, i.e. in connection with fine food, beer, wine, tea and many other products whose consumption can be pleasing to the senses.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1418202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1418202", "title": "Cumdach", "text": "Cumdach\n\nA cumdach () or book shrine is an elaborate ornamented box or case used as a reliquary to enshrine books regarded as relics of the saints who had used them in Early Medieval Ireland. They are normally later than the book they contain, often by several centuries, typically the book comes from the heroic age of Irish monasticism before 800, and the surviving cumdachs date from after 1000, although it is clear the form dates from considerably earlier. Several were then considerably reworked in the Gothic period. The usual form is a design based on a cross on the main face, with use of large gems of rock crystal or other semi-precious stones, leaving the spaces between the arms of the cross for more varied decoration. Several were carried on a chain or cord, often suspended round the neck, which by placing them next to the heart was believed to bring spiritual and perhaps medical benefits (the same was done with the St Cuthbert Gospel in a leather bag in medieval Durham). They were also used to witness contracts. Many had hereditary lay keepers from among the chiefly families who had formed links with monasteries. Most surviving examples are now in the National Museum of Ireland (\"NMI\").\nOnly five early examples survive, including those of the Book of Dimma and Book of Mulling at Trinity College, Dublin, and the Cathach of St. Columba and Stowe Missal at the Royal Irish Academy (the former's cumdach is in the National Museum of Ireland). Only the cumdach for the Gospels of St Molaise survives, while the book is lost, but more often the reverse is the case. Other books such as the Book of Kells, Book of Armagh and Book of Durrow are known to have once had either cumdachs or treasure bindings, or both, but with their valuable precious metals they were a natural target for looters and thieves. The church in Ireland emphasised relics that were, or were thought to be, objects frequently used by monastic saints, rather than the body parts preferred by most of the church, although these were also kept in local versions of the house-shaped chasse form, such as the Scottish Monymusk Reliquary. Another Irish speciality was the bell-shrine, encasing the hand bells used to summon the community to services or meals, and one of the earliest reliquaries enshrined the belt of an unknown saint, and was probably worn as a test of truthfulness and to cure illness. It probably dates to the 8th century and was found in a peat bog near Moylough, County Sligo.\n\nCumdachs are to be distinguished from the metalwork treasure bindings that probably covered most grand liturgical books of the period—the theft and loss of that covering the Book of Kells (if it was not a cumdach alone) is recorded. However the designs may well have been very similar; the best surviving Insular example, the lower cover of the Lindau Gospels in the Morgan Library in New York, is also centred on a large cross, surrounded by interlace panels. Treasure bindings were metalwork assemblies tacked onto the wooden boards of a conventional bookbinding, so essentially the same technically as the faces of many cumdachs, which are also attached with tacks to a core wooden box.\n\nSeveral of the earliest documented examples have now been lost: the Book of Durrow's is mentioned below, and the Book of Kells lost its cumdach when it was stolen in 1006. The Book of Armagh was covered in 937, and perhaps lost its cover when it was captured in battle and ransomed by the Norman John de Courcy in 1177. Several of the surviving examples have high-quality early 20th century reproductions in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which are not on display there, but have good illustrations available online, unlike the original pieces.\n\nThe earliest documented example was made to house and protect the Book of Durrow at the behest of King of Ireland Flann Sinna (879–916), by which point it was at Durrow, and believed to be a relic of Colum Cille. The shrine was lost in the 17th century, but its appearance, including an inscription recording the king's patronage, is recorded in a note from 1677, now bound into the book as folio IIv, although other inscriptions are not transcribed. Once in the shrine it was probably rarely if ever removed for use as a book.\n\nThe shrine known as the \"Domhnach Airgid\" (\"silver church\") was originally 8th century, but little is visible from before a major reworking around 1350 by the abbot of Clones. A fully three-dimensional figure of Christ crucified is at the centre of the main face, with relief plaques of saints and the Virgin and Child, and other scenes on the sides which combine principal figures in relief and others in engraving. The style is rather more sophisticated than in some 14th century reworkings, with elegant running animals on small mounts at the corners, and the goldsmith who signed it, John O Bardan, is recorded living at Drogheda; by now goldsmiths in Ireland, as elsewhere in Europe, were usually laymen (NMI, R2834, 16.7 cm high).\n\nThe oldest cumdach surviving largely in its original form is that made in the early 11th century for the gospels of Saint Molaise (NMI, R4006, 14.75 cm high, 11.70 wide) with the typical construction of a wooden core to which metal plaques are nailed. The top face is mainly silvered bronze and silver-gilt and has the four symbols of the Evangelists in the spaces between a cross, with gold filigree knotwork panels. There is a reproduction in New York.\n\nProbably the best-known is the cumdach for the Cathach of St. Columba, an important psalter which in fact seems to date from just after the death of Columba or Colum Cille in 597, but is still probably the earliest Irish book to survive and a very prestigious relic. It belonged to the O'Donnell dynasty and was famously carried by them as a battle standard (\"Cathach\" means \"Battler\") in its cumdach (NMI, R2835, 25.1 cm wide), hung round the neck. The initial work on the case was done between 1072 and 1098 at Kells, but a new main face was added in the 14th century with a large seated Christ in Majesty flanked by scenes of the Crucifixion and saints in gilt repoussé (NMI R2835, 25.1 cm wide).\n\nAnother cumdach used in battle was that of the \"Moisach\", from Clonmany, County Donegal, whose metal cord survives for carrying it, probably round the neck. Originally late 11th century, it was recovered in 1534 with repoussé silver decoration with many figures round a cross (NMI 2001:84, 25 cm wide). The manuscript inside was originally associated with St Cairneach of Dulane, County Meath, but by the Gothic period had been \"absorbed into the cult of St Columba\".\n\nThe cumdach of the Book of Dimma is from the 12th century, again with a reproduction in New York. On one face it has panels of openwork decoration in Viking Ringerike style. Like the manuscript, it is in Trinity College Library, Dublin.\n\nThe Stowe Missal of about 750 retains its cumdach, with metalwork plaques attached with nails to a wooden core of oak (NMI 1883:614a, 18.7 cm high, 15.8 wide). The metalwork is elaborately decorated, with some animal and human figures, and one face and the sides probably date to between 1027 and 1033, on the basis of inscriptions recording its donation and making, while the other face is later, and can be dated to about 1375, again from its inscriptions.\n\nThe older \"lower\" face, which is currently detached from the case, is in silver-gilt copper alloy, with a large cross inside a border that carries the inscription in Irish, which also runs along the arms of the cross. The centre of the cross was later replaced (\"severely embellished\" as the National Museum put it), probably at the same time as the later face, by a setting for a large stone (now missing) with four lobed sections, similar to the centre of the lower face. The inscription has missing sections because of this, but can mostly be reconstructed: \"It asks for a prayer for the abbot of Lorrha, Mathgamain Ua Cathail (+1037) and for Find Ua Dúngalaigh, king of Múscraige Tíre (+1033). It also mentions Donnchadh mac Briain, styled 'king of Ireland' and Mac Raith Ua Donnchada, king of the Eoganacht of Cashel (+1052) as well as the name of the maker, Donnchadh Ua Taccáin [a monk] 'of the community of Cluain (Clonmacnoise)'.\" The four spaces between cross and border have panels of geometric openwork decoration, and there are small panels with knotwork decoration at the corners of the border and inside the curved ends of the cross members.\n\nThe sides have unsilvered copper alloy plaques with figures of angels, animals, clergy and warriors, set in decorative backgrounds. The newer \"upper\" face, of silver-gilt, is again centred on a cross with a large oval rock crystal stone at the centre and lobed surrounds, and other gems. The inscription, engraved on plain silver plaques, runs round the border and the spaces between cross and border have four engraved figures of the crucified Christ, Virgin and Child, a bishop making a blessing gesture, and a cleric holding a book (possibly St John). The inscription \"invokes a prayer for Pilib Ó Ceinnéidigh, 'king of Ormond' and his wife Áine, both of whom died in 1381. It also refers to Giolla Ruadhán Ó Macáin, abbot of the Augustinian priory of Lorrha and the maker, Domhnall Ó Tolairi\". Black niello is used to bring out the engraved lines of the inscription and figures, and the technique is very similar to that of the later work on the Shrine of Saint Patrick's Tooth (also in the NMI), which was also given a makeover in the 1370s, for a patron some 50 km from Lorrha. They were probably added to by the same artist, something that can only rarely be seen in the few survivals of medieval goldsmith's work.\n\n\n\n"}

On April 8, 2015, he gave his first public lecture under this affiliation at the National Gallery of Canada's Wednesday Morning Lecture Series, focusing his remarks on Piero de Cosimo's painting. Franklin helped plan the Canadian Photography Institute, which has promised gifts from David Thomson and major funding from Bank of Nova Scotia. He is an editor of \"The Canadians\" (2016), a selection of photographs from \"The Globe and Mail\" archives.\n\nFranklin was named director of the Cleveland Museum of Art in 2010. While Franklin was Director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, a donation of $1,000,000 was made by Leigh Carter in 2013 to the museum's endowment to fund a permanent fellowship to help the museum's director conduct research on special art historical projects.\n\nAfter a three-year tenure, Franklin abruptly resigned on October 21, 2013, citing personal reasons and a need \"to do more research and writing\". Soon thereafter, the Cleveland Scene revealed that Franklin (married with two children) had been in a romantic relationship with an employee of the museum. The board of directors at the museum had been made aware of the affair when the employee was found to have apparently committed suicide in her Cleveland Heights apartment, shortly after she and Franklin were supposed to have travelled to Spain together, and one week before they were supposed to travel to Italy. According to police reports, David Franklin called the 911 himself and was the only person present at the scene. When police came to investigate the suspicious death, Franklin lied to the officers, pretending having received a text message from the woman, which, according to the Police, never happened. He claimed to have run to the apartment after receiving this text message and to have discovered the body by entering the apartment through an open door. In the course of the investigation, it became apparent that the employee's digital camera and cell phone were missing. Police have also discovered that a major transfer of data had been done from the woman's phone shortly after she was found dead. As the family could not believe many details of the reported story, a detective was assigned to further investigate the death and Franklin's story. When this revelation came to the attention of the board, Franklin was forced to resign.\n\nPreviously, Franklin served as deputy director of the National Gallery of Canada. He worked at the National Gallery of Canada for twelve years, beginning as the curator of prints and eventually rising to the post of deputy director and chief curator. In 2009, the National Gallery of Canada Foundation received a donation from the philanthropists Donald and Beth Sobey for The Donald and Beth Sobey Chief Curator’s Research Endowment. While at the National Gallery, Franklin became involved in a controversy involving the firing of a subordinate. His action of completely removing emails, by deleting emails from his system's trash, was seen as a move to remove evidence of wrongful termination. Franklin denied this. He was removed from his post, and after suing the institution, was restored to his position, before being fired a second time, a few days later.\n\nFranklin holds a PhD from London's Courtauld Institute of Art with specialization in Italian Renaissance art.

Exposition is one of four rhetorical modes (also known as \"modes of discourse\"), along with description, argumentation, and narration, as elucidated by Alexander Bain and John Genung. Each of the rhetorical modes is present in a variety of forms, and each has its own purpose and conventions. There are several ways to accomplish exposition.\n\nIndirect exposition, sometimes called incluing, is a technique of worldbuilding in which the reader is gradually exposed to background information about the world in which a story is set. The idea is to \"clue\" the readers in to the world the author is building without them being aware of it. This can be done in a number of ways: through dialogues, flashbacks, characters' thoughts, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a backstory. Instead of saying \"I am a woman\", a first person narrator can say \"I kept the papers inside my purse.\" The reader (in most English-speaking cultures) now knows the character is probably female.\n\nIndirect exposition has always occurred in storytelling incidentally, but is first clearly identified, in the modern literary world, in the writing of Rudyard Kipling. In his stories set in India like \"The Jungle Book\", Kipling was faced with the problem of Western readers not knowing the culture and environment of that land, so he gradually developed the technique of explaining through example. But this was relatively subtle, compared to Kiplings' science fiction stories, where he used the technique much more obviously and necessarily, to explain an entirely fantastic world unknown to any reader, in his Aerial Board of Control universe.\n\nKipling's writing influenced other science fiction writers, most notably the \"Dean of Science Fiction\", Robert Heinlein, who became known for his advanced rhetorical and storytelling techniques, including indirect exposition. \n\nThe word \"incluing\" is attributed to fantasy and science fiction author Jo Walton. She defined it as \"the process of scattering information seamlessly through the text, as opposed to stopping the story to impart the information.\" \"Information dump\" (or info-dump) is the term given for overt exposition, which writers want to avoid. In an \"idiot lecture\", characters tell each other information that needs to be explained for the purpose of the audience, but of which the characters in-universe would already be aware. Writers are advised to avoid writing dialogues beginning with \"As you well know, Professor, a prime number is...\"\n\n"}

{"id": "240347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240347", "title": "Genre art", "text": "Genre art\n\nGenre art is the pictorial representation in any of various media of scenes or events from everyday life, such as markets, domestic settings, interiors, parties, inn scenes, and street scenes. Such representations (also called genre works, genre scenes, or genre views) may be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Some variations of the term \"genre art\" specify the medium or type of visual work, as in \"genre painting\", \"genre prints\", \"genre photographs\", and so on.\n\nRather confusingly, the normal meaning of genre, covering any particular combination of an artistic medium and a type of subject matter (as, for example, in the romance novel), is also used in the visual arts. Thus, genre works, especially when referring to the painting of the Dutch Golden Age and Flemish Baroque painting—the great periods of genre works—may also be used as an umbrella term for painting in various specialized categories such as still-life, marine painting, architectural painting and animal painting, as well as genre scenes proper where the emphasis is on human figures. Painting was divided into a hierarchy of genres, with history painting at the top, as the most difficult and therefore prestigious, and still life and architectural painting at the bottom. But history paintings are a genre in painting, not genre works.\n\nThe following concentrates on painting, but genre motifs were also extremely popular in many forms of the decorative arts, especially from the Rococo of the early 18th century onwards. Single figures or small groups decorated a huge variety of objects such as porcelain, furniture, wallpaper and textiles.\n\n\"Genre painting\", also called \"genre scene\" or \"petit genre\", depicts aspects of everyday life by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a genre scene is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively—thus distinguishing \"petit genre\" from history paintings (also called \"grand genre\") and portraits. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person—a member of his family, say—as a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait—sometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the bourgeoisie, or middle class. Genre themes appear in nearly all art traditions. Painted decorations in ancient Egyptian tombs often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and Peiraikos is mentioned by Pliny the Elder as a Hellenistic panel painter of \"low\" subjects, such as survive in mosaic versions and provincial wall-paintings at Pompeii: \"barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects\". Medieval illuminated manuscripts often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the \"Labours of the Months\" in the calendar section of books of hours, most famously Les Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry.\n\nThe Low Countries dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both Flemish Baroque painting and Dutch Golden Age painting produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes. In the previous century, the Flemish Renaissance painter Jan Sanders van Hemessen painted innovative large-scale genre scenes, sometimes including a moral theme or a religious scene in the background in the first half of the 16th century. These were part of a pattern of \"Mannerist inversion\" in Antwerp painting, giving \"low\" elements previously in the decorative background of images prominent emphasis. Joachim Patinir expanded his landscapes, making the figures a small element, and Pieter Aertsen painted works dominated by spreads of still life food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background. Pieter Brueghel the Elder made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel's wake.\nIn Italy, a \"school\" of genre painting was stimulated by the arrival in Rome of the Dutch painter Pieter van Laer in 1625. He acquired the nickname \"Il Bamboccio\" and his followers were called the \"Bamboccianti\", whose works would inspire Giacomo Ceruti, Antonio Cifrondi, and Giuseppe Maria Crespi among many others.\n\nLouis le Nain was an important exponent of genre painting in 17th-century France, painting groups of peasants at home, where the 18th century would bring a heightened interest in the depiction of everyday life, whether through the romanticized paintings of Watteau and Fragonard, or the careful realism of Chardin. Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725-1805) and others painted detailed and rather sentimental groups or individual portraits of peasants that were to be influential on 19th-century painting.\n\nIn England, William Hogarth (1697–1764) conveyed comedy, social criticism and moral lessons through canvases that told stories of ordinary people ful of narrative detail (aided by long sub-titles), often in serial form, as in his \"A Rake's Progress\", first painted in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1735.\n\nSpain had a tradition predating The Book of Good Love of social observation and commentary based on the Old Roman Latin tradition, practiced by many of its painters and illuminators. At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many picaresque genre scenes of street life—as well as the kitchen scenes known as bodegones—were painted by the artists of The Spanish Golden Age, notably Velázquez (1599–1660) and Murillo (1617–82). More than a century later, the Spanish artist Francisco de Goya (1746–1828) used genre scenes in painting and printmaking as a medium for dark commentary on the human condition. His \"The Disasters of War\", a series of 82 genre incidents from the Peninsular War, took genre art to unprecedented heights of expressiveness.\n\nWith the decline of religious and historical painting in the 19th century, artists increasingly found their subject matter in the life around them. Realists such as Gustave Courbet (1819–77) upset expectations by depicting everyday scenes in huge paintings—at the scale traditionally reserved for \"important\" subjects—thus blurring the boundary which had set genre painting apart as a \"minor\" category. History painting itself shifted from the exclusive depiction of events of great public importance to the depiction of genre scenes in historical times, both the private moments of great figures, and the everyday life of ordinary people. In French art this was known as the Troubador style. This trend, already apparent by 1817 when Ingres painted \"Henri IV Playing with His Children\", culminated in the pompier art of French academicians such as Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904) and Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier (1815–91). In the second half of the century interest in genre scenes, often in historical settings or with pointed social or moral comment, greatly increased across Europe.\n\nWilliam Powell Frith (1819–1909) was perhaps the most famous English genre painter of the Victorian era, painting large and extremely crowded scenes; the expansion in size and ambition in 19th-century genre painting was a common trend. Other 19th-century English genre painters include Augustus Leopold Egg, Frederick Daniel Hardy, George Elgar Hicks, William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. Scotland produced two influential genre painters, David Allan (1744–96) and Sir David Wilkie (1785–1841). Wilkie's \"The Cottar's Saturday Night\" (1837) inspired a major work by the French painter Gustave Courbet, \"After Dinner at Ornans\" (1849). Famous Russian realist painters like Pavel Fedotov, Vasily Perov, and Ilya Repin also produced genre paintings.\n\nIn Germany, Carl Spitzweg (1808–85) specialized in gently humorous genre scenes, and in Italy Gerolamo Induno (1825–90) painted scenes of military life. Subsequently, the Impressionists, as well as such 20th-century artists as Pierre Bonnard, Itshak Holtz, Edward Hopper, and David Park painted scenes of daily life. But in the context of modern art the term \"genre painting\" has come to be associated mainly with painting of an especially anecdotal or sentimental nature, painted in a traditionally realistic technique.\n\nThe first true genre painter in the United States was the German immigrant John Lewis Krimmel, who learning from Wilkie and Hogarth, produced gently humorous scenes of life in Philadelphia from 1812–21. Other notable 19th-century genre painters from the United States include George Caleb Bingham, William Sidney Mount, and Eastman Johnson. Harry Roseland focused on scenes of poor African Americans in the post-American Civil War South, and John Rogers (1829–1904) was a sculptor whose small genre works, mass-produced in cast plaster, were immensely popular in America. The works of American painter Ernie Barnes (1938–2009) and those of illustrator Norman Rockwell (1894–1978) could exemplify a more modern type of genre painting.\n\nJapanese ukiyo-e prints are rich in depictions of people at leisure and at work, as are Korean paintings, particularly those created in the 18th century.\n\nWhile genre painting began, in the 17th century, with representations by Europeans of European life, the invention and early development of photography coincided with the most expansive and aggressive era of European imperialism, in the mid-to-late 19th century, and so genre photographs, typically made in the proximity of military, scientific and commercial expeditions, often also depict the people of other cultures that Europeans encountered throughout the world.\n\nAlthough the distinctions are not clear, genre works should be distinguished from ethnographic studies, which are pictorial representations resulting from direct observation and descriptive study of the culture and way of life of particular societies, and which constitute one class of products of such disciplines as anthropology and the behavioural sciences.\n\nThe development of photographic technology to make cameras portable and exposures instantaneous enabled photographers to venture beyond the studio to follow other art forms in the depiction of everyday life. This category has come to be known as street photography.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1126518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1126518", "title": "Jazz bass", "text": "Jazz bass\n\nJazz bass is the use of the double bass or bass guitar to improvise accompaniment (\"comping\") basslines and solos in a jazz or jazz fusion style. Players began using the double bass in jazz in the 1890s to supply the low-pitched walking basslines that outlined the chord progressions of the songs. From the 1920s and 1930s Swing and big band era, through 1940s Bebop and 1950s Hard Bop, to the 1960s-era \"free jazz\" movement, the resonant, woody sound of the double bass anchored everything from small jazz combos to large jazz big bands.\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, some jazz bass players began to use the electric bass guitar in place of the double bass. The electric bass, which was easier to amplify to loud volumes onstage, gained particular prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s jazz subgenre which blended jazz with the powerfully amplified electric instruments of rock music, creating jazz fusion.\n\nMost jazz bassists specialize in either the double bass or the electric bass, although the ability to \"double\" (play both instruments) is common. A small number of players, such as Stanley Clarke and John Patitucci, have achieved virtuoso skill on both instruments. Whether a jazz bassist is \"comping\" (accompanying) with a walking bassline or soloing, or playing on a double bass or an electric bass, they usually aim to create a rhythmic drive and \"timefeel\" that creates a sense of \"swing\" and \"groove\". \n\nBeginning around 1890, the African-American communities in early New Orleans used a jazz ensemble which played a mixture of marches, ragtime, and dixieland music. This ensemble was initially a marching band with sousaphone (or occasionally bass saxophone) supplying the bass line. As the music moved from playing for funerals on the street and into bars and brothels, the double bass gradually replaced these wind instruments. Many early bassists doubled on both the \"brass bass\" and \"string bass,\" as the instruments were then often referred to. Bassists played \"walking\" basslines—scale-based lines that outlined the harmony and provided a foundation for the tunes.\n\nBecause an unamplified double bass is generally the quietest instrument in a jazz band, many players of the 1920s and 1930s used the \"slap style\", slapping and pulling the strings to make a rhythmic \"slap\" sound against the fingerboard. The slap style cuts through the sound of a band better than simply plucking the strings, and make the bass more easily heard on early sound recordings, as the recording equipment of that time did not capture low frequencies well. For more about the slap style, see \"Playing styles,\" below.\n\nDouble bass players who have contributed to the evolution of jazz include the Swing era player Jimmy Blanton, who played with Duke Ellington, and Oscar Pettiford, who pioneered the instrument's soloistic use in Bebop. The \"cool\" style of jazz was influenced by players such as Scott LaFaro and Percy Heath, whose solos were very melodic.\n\nPaul Chambers (who worked with Miles Davis on the famous \"Kind of Blue\" album) achieved renown for being one of the early jazz bassists to play Bebop solos in arco (bowed) style. The first player known to do that was Slam Stewart, who would scat in octaves with his bowed bass in his solos, good examples of which can be found on the trio recordings he made with Art Tatum and Tiny Grimes. Ron Carter (another bassist who worked with Miles Davis in his second great quintet), is credited as a key figure of the modern school of jazz bass playing.He is one of the most-recorded bassists in jazz.\n\nFree jazz was influenced by the composer/bassist Charles Mingus (who also contributed to hard bop) and Charlie Haden, best known for his work with Ornette Coleman. In the 1950s, some big band bandleaders began to ask their upright players to use the then-newly available Fender bass, the first widely available electric bass. In the 1970s, as jazz and rock music were blended by performers to create the \"fusion\" genre, players such as Jaco Pastorius began to develop a unique sound using the electric bass.\n\nApart from jazz fusion and Latin-influenced jazz, the double bass is still widely used in jazz in the 2010s. The deep sound and woody tone of the plucked double bass is distinct from the sound of the fretted bass guitar. The bass guitar produces a different sound than the double bass, because its strings are usually stopped with the aid of metal frets. As well, bass guitars usually have a solid wood body, which means that the sound is produced by electronic amplification of the vibration of the strings. The solid body upright, also known as a \"stick\" bass or \"EUB\" variation is still widely used by bass players in salsa and timba bands, because its sound is so well suited to those styles. The EUB is smaller and lighter than a double bass, making touring and travelling easier, and its solid (or mostly solid) body enables bassists to play at a much higher volume with a bass amp without feedback.\n\nIn jazz, since the 1950s, the double bass is usually played with amplification and it is mostly played with the fingers, \"pizzicato\" style, except during some solos, where players may use the bow. The pizzicato style varies between different players and genres. Some players perform with the sides of one, two, or three fingers, especially for walking basslines and slow tempo ballads, because this is purported to create a stronger and more solid tone. Some players use the more nimble tips of the fingers to play fast-moving solo passages or to pluck lightly for quiet tunes.\n\nUsing amplification gives the player more control over the tone of the instrument, because amplifiers have equalization controls that can accentuate certain frequencies (often the bass frequencies) while de-accentuating some frequencies (often the high frequencies, so that there is less finger noise). While jazz double bass players use amplification, they typically use much smaller, lower-powered bass amplifiers and smaller speaker cabinets than those used by an electric bass player playing in a jazz fusion show. An upright player performing at a small club may only bring a 1x12\" combo amp to the gig. When a small jazz combo is playing in a small jazz club, the double bass player may use only a modest amount of amplification, so that the audience is hearing a mixture of the natural acoustic tone and the amplified sound. Of course, if that same band plays on a huge jazz festival mainstage, all of the bass tone reaching the audience's ears will be from the sound reinforcement system.\n\nAn unamplified acoustic bass' tone is limited by the frequency responsiveness of the instrument's hollow body, which means that the very low pitches may not be as loud as the higher pitches. With an amplifier and equalization devices, a bass player can boost the low frequencies, which evens out the frequency response. As well, the use of an amplifier can increase the sustain of the instrument, which is particularly useful for accompaniment during ballads and for melodic solos with long held notes. Like other acoustic instruments used with amplification, such as the jazz violin, a double bass is often plugged into a preamplifier, impedance-matching device, and/or a Direct Injection (DI box) box before it is routed to the PA system, electronic effects, or the bass instrument amplifier.\n\nIn traditional jazz and swing it is sometimes played in the \"slap style\". This is a vigorous version of pizzicato where the strings are \"slapped\" against the fingerboard between the main notes of the bass line, producing a snare drum-like percussive sound. The main notes are either played normally or by pulling the string away from the fingerboard and releasing it so that it bounces off the fingerboard, producing a distinctive percussive attack in addition to the expected pitch. Notable slap style bass players, whose use of the technique was often highly syncopated and virtuosic, sometimes interpolate two, or even three more slaps in between notes of their bass line.\n\nIn both jazz and jazz fusion bands, some jazz bassists use a modified type of double bass called the electric upright bass (abbreviated EUB and sometimes also called stick bass). The stick bass is also widely used in salsa, because its volume and tone are especially suited to that style of music, even in studio recording. It is an electronically amplified version of the double bass that has a minimal or 'skeleton' body, which greatly reduces the size and weight of the instrument. The EUB retains enough of the features of the double bass so that double bass players are comfortable performing on it. While the EUB retains some of the tonal characteristics of the double bass, its electrically amplified nature also gives it its own unique sound. As well, an EUB is considerably easier to transport than its acoustic equivalent. The scale length of EUBs varies: some scales are 42\", similar to most double basses, whilst other models have scale lengths of only 30\" like a short scale bass guitar. The shorter scale can make it easier for bass guitarists to convert to the EUB.\n\nSolid bodied EUBs produce very little sound without electronic amplification. Hollow-bodied EUBs produce a quiet tone that is loud enough for individual practice. However, since hollow-bodied EUBs do not have a large resonant cavity like a double bass, they cannot reproduce the lowest notes of the instrument without an amplifier. To amplify the EUB, the string vibrations are sensed with a pickup. Early EUBs used magnetic pickups similar to those in electric guitars, or percussive magnetic diaghram pickups (e.g., the Ampeg \"Baby Bass\"). Many modern EUBs use piezoelectric pickups located in the bridge or a combination of pickup types. The signal from the pickup is usually preamplified and equalized with a preamplifier and then sent to a bass amplifier or a PA system. For silent practice in a hotel room or apartment, an EUB can also be connected to headphones.\n\nPreamplifiers and equalizers for acoustic instruments or double basses can also be used to \"roll off\" the treble frequencies or \"notch out\" the \"scratchy-sounding\" frequencies. Since the EUB typically does not have a hollow sound chamber, or only includes a small sound chamber, the EUB is less prone to audio feedback than the double bass when amplified. To use a bow with an EUB, both the bridge and fingerboard must be radiussed (given a curve). EUBs are much easier to transport to gigs, or fly with on tours than a large, fragile double bass.\n\nThe electric bass is a relative newcomer to the world of jazz. Until the 1950s, the double bass was used to anchor jazz ensembles from small combos to huge big bands. The electric bass was introduced in the early 1950s when Roy Johnson (and later Monk Montgomery) first used the instrument in Lionel Hampton's big band. When the electric bass is used in jazz, it has both an accompaniment and a soloing role. When the bass is used to accompany, it may be used to perform walking basslines for traditional tunes and \"jazz standards\", in smooth quarter note lines that imitate the sound of the double bass. \n\nThe electric bass player can play all of the same types of bass lines played by her upright bass cousin. However, due to the design of the electric bass as a guitar-family instrument, it is possible to play rapid bass lines that would be impossible on an upright bass. For example, an electric bassist in a fusion or Latin band can play a bassline composed entirely of rapid, syncopated sixteenth notes. For Latin or salsa tunes and rock-infused jazz fusion tunes, the electric bass may play challenging, fast-moving rhythmic figures in coordination with the drummer, or lay down a low, heavy groove. \n\nIn a fusion band, electric bass players have to provide a solid, heavy bass foundation for the band while a drummer, electric guitarist (amplified through a guitar amp) and synthesizer or electric piano player performing (amplified through a keyboard amp) are all playing. As well, fusion bands are more likely to play a rock-size venue, such as a large club or theatre, than a small jazz club. To provide a good bass sound, a fusion electric bass player will often use a powerful bass amplifier and a larger speaker cabinet than an upright player would use, such as a 4X10\" cabinet, or even two 4X10\" cabinets.\nIn a jazz setting, the electric bass tends to have much a much more expansive solo role than in most popular styles. In most rock settings, the bass guitarist may only have a few short bass breaks or brief solos during a concert. During a jazz concert, a jazz bassist may have a number of lengthy improvised solos, which are called \"blowing\" in jazz parlance. Among those who have spearheaded the bass guitar in jazz are Jaco Pastorius, Victor Wooten, and Marcus Miller.\n\nOne of the options for bass guitarists is whether to use an instrument with frets on the fingerboard or not. On a fretted bass, metal frets divide the fingerboard into semitone divisions (as on a guitar). The original Fender basses had 20 frets, but modern basses may have 24 or more. Fretless basses have a distinct sound, because the absence of frets means that the string must be pressed down directly onto the wood of the fingerboard as with the double bass. The string buzzes against the wood and is somewhat muted because the sounding portion of the string is in direct contact with the flesh of the player's finger. The fretless bass allows players to use the expressive devices of glissando, vibrato and microtonal intonations such as quarter tones and just intonation. \n\nIn a small combo, the bass player may alone determine which type of bass to use and for which tunes. In a band with a bandleader, the leader may provide guidance on what tunes are best suited to each type of bass. Some bassists use both fretted and fretless basses in performances, according to the type of material they are performing. While fretless basses are often associated with jazz and jazz fusion, bassists from other genres use fretless basses, such as metal bassist Steve DiGiorgio.\n\nBill Wyman takes credit for creating the first fretless bass guitar in 1961 when he converted an inexpensive Japanese fretted bass by removing the frets. The first production fretless bass was the Ampeg AUB-1 introduced in 1966, and Fender introduced a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius created his own fretless bass by removing the frets from a Fender Jazz Bass, filling the holes with wood putty, and coating the fretboard with epoxy resin.\n\nPastorius used epoxy rather than varnish to obtain a glass-like finish suitable for the use of roundwound strings, which are otherwise much harder on the wood of the fingerboard. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. Tapewound (double bass type) and flatwound strings are sometimes used with the fretless bass so that the metal string windings do not wear down the fingerboard. Some fretless basses have epoxy-coated fingerboards to increase durability, enhance sustain, and give a brighter tone. Though most fretless basses have four strings, five-string and six-string fretless basses are also available. Fretless basses with more than six strings are also available as \"boutique\" or custom-made instruments.\n\nWhile the majority of jazz and jazz fusion recordings and live performances use either the double bass (or a related instrument such as an electric upright bass) or the electric bass to supply the \"low end\", there are some exceptions. In jazz organ trios, a Hammond organ player performs the basslines using the bass pedalboard or their lower manual, along with a drummer and a saxophonist. In some jazz fusion groups, the basslines may be played by a keyboard player on a bass synthesizer or other keyboard. As well, in some duos and other small groups, the basslines may be provided by a piano player; in a duo consisting of a jazz pianist and a jazz singer, the piano player plays a bassline with the left hand and chords in the right hand underneath the singer's voice. Similarly, in some duos or trios, a jazz guitarist may play basslines, a role that is especially feasible if the guitarist has a seven-string guitar with a low \"B\" string. In traditional Dixieland or New Orleans-style jazz groups, the basslines may be played by a tuba or other low brass instrument.\n\n\n"}

The sundial, discovered during a renovation in 1771, commemorates the rebuilding of the ruined church, about the year 1055, by Orm, son of Gamal, whose Scandinavian names suggest that he may have been a descendant of Vikings who overran and settled this region in the late 9th century.\nThe inscription on the sundial reads as follows:\n\n(ǷFS may be an error for ǷES, though if the letters were originally painted, as seems quite possible,the E may have appeared intact. The Anglo-Saxon character represented in this transcription by '7' stands for the conjunction 'and'. Several characters in the Anglo-Saxon alphabet but no longer used in English appear in the inscriptions. Ð/ð (called 'eth')is equivalent to modern 'th', as also is þ (called 'thorn'). Ƿ (called 'wynn') is equivalent to modern 'w'; and Æ/æ (called 'ash') is here equivalent to modern 'a').\n\nThe sundial itself is inscribed\nAnd at the bottom of the central panel is the line\n\nThe reference is to Edward the Confessor and Earl Tostig, Edward's brother-in-law, who was the son of Earl Godwin of Wessex and the brother of Harold. Tostig held the Earldom of Northumbria from 1055 to 1065, fixing the date of the church's reconstruction to that decade. He is also known for the murder of Gamal, Orm's father. The language of the inscription is late Old English, with a failing case and gender system. The compound \"solmerca\" is otherwise unattested in English, and has been ascribed to Scandinavian influence (Old Norse \"solmerki\" 'sign of the zodiac').\n\nThe Historic England Web site, which lists St Gregory's as Grade I, provides the following translation of the full, three part inscription: \"Orm Gamal's son bought St. Gregory's Minster when it was all broken down and fallen and he let it be made anew from the ground to Christ and St. Gregory, in Edward's days, the king, and in Tosti's days, the Earl. This is day's Sun marker at every tide. And Haworth me wrought and Brand, priests.\" The last two sentences are more fully translated by some sources as: \"This is the day’s sun-marking at every hour. And Hawarth made me and Brand priest(s)\" \n\nThe Journal of the Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society. (Volume 69), published in 1997, offers more persuasive interpretations of the final sentence: \"First, it makes two statements: that Hawarth made the sundial (that is, he was the craftsman), and that Brand was the priest. The second interpretation is that both Hawarth (who was probably a craftsman and could have been a priest) and Brand the priest (acting as his assistant or \ninstructor), together made the sundial. Higgitt has suggested that 'Brand was \nperhaps responsible for the drafting and laying out of the text, and perhaps too \nfor the design of the sundial'.27\" (The Higgitt referred to is John Higgitt who was a medieval scholar who specialized in analyses of Anglo-Saxon inscriptions. He contributed to a 1997 Medieval Archaeology journal report, \"Kirkdale - The inscriptions\", 41. Vol 41, pp. 51-99.)\n\nPart of the sundial's historical significance is its testimony that, a century and a half after the Viking colonisation of the region, the settlers' descendants such as Orm Gamalson were now using English, not Danish or Norwegian, as the appropriate language for monumental inscriptions.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Vienna on 5 March 1882 and died of heart failure while swimming in Montego Bay, Jamaica on 15 January 1955.\n\nHe was the son of Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild. He owned a spectacular palace in Vienna, the Palais Rothschild, that housed an exquisite art collection and antiques.\n\nAfter the Anschluß of Austria to Nazi Germany in March 1938, he was arrested at the airport at Aspern and taken into custody by the Nazis because he was a distinguished member of the Jewish oligarchy. He was released only after lengthy negotiations between the family and the Nazis and upon payment of $21,000,000, believed to have been the largest ransom payment in history for any individual.\n\nWhile imprisoned he was visited by Heinrich Himmler. Rothschild apparently impressed the SS leader, who subsequently ordered that Rothschild's prison conditions be improved with better furniture and sanitation facilities. Despite appeals from Queen Mary of the United Kingdom and possibly the Duke of Windsor, Rothschild was held in Vienna's Hotel Metropole while the German government attempted to expropriate his business concerns. He was imprisoned at least through July 1938, and his property placed under control of a German \"commissioner\". Felix Somary, in his memoirs, recalls that, soon before the Anschluss, he phoned to the baron repeatedly, in a desperate attempt to convince him to leave Austria. The day before the Anschluss, Louis's brother Alphons and his wife were visiting him in Switzerland, wanting to go back into Austria; he persuaded them to remain there, and to get his children Francesca de Rothschild and Heidi de Rothschild away from Austria to Netherlands.\n\nFinally allowed to leave Austria, Louis survived the Holocaust and Second World War.\n\nAll of the Rothschild possessions were plundered and subsequently \"Aryanised\". The city-palace of the family was destroyed after the war. The baron never received most of his former belongings back, since most of the paintings were taken over by the Austrian state, which did not allow the paintings to leave the country. In 1998, over 200 art works were returned to the Rothschild heirs by the Austrian Government, and were placed at Christie's in London for auction in 1999.\n\nIn 1946 he married the countess Hildegard Johanna von Auersperg (1895–1981) and lived in East Barnard, Vermont (United States) and England. He died childless in 1955.\n\n"}

{"id": "184631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184631", "title": "Maya Deren", "text": "Maya Deren\n\nMaya Deren (April 29, 1917 – October 13, 1961), born Eleonora Derenkowska (), was a Ukrainian-born American filmmaker and one of the most important American experimental filmmakers and entrepreneurial promoters of the avant-garde in the 1940s and 1950s. Deren was also a choreographer, dancer, film theorist, poet, lecturer, writer, and photographer.\n\nThe function of film, Deren believed, like most art forms, was to create an experience; each one of her films would evoke new conclusions, rendering her oeuvre dynamic and always-evolving. She combined her interests in dance, Haitian Vodou and subjective psychology in a series of surreal, perceptual, black-and-white short films. Using editing, multiple exposures, jump cutting, superimposition, slow-motion, and other camera techniques to her fullest advantage, Deren created continued motion through discontinued space, while abandoning the established notions of physical space and time, with the ability to turn her vision into a stream of consciousness.\n\nOne of the most influential experimental films in American cinema was \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" (1943), her collaboration with Alexander Hammid. She went on to make several films of her own, including \"At Land\" (1944), \"A Study in Choreography for Camera\" (1945), and \"Ritual in Transfigured Time\" (1946), writing, producing, directing, editing, and photographing them with help from only one other person, Hella Heyman, her camerawoman.\n\nDeren was born in Kiev, Ukraine (then Russian Republic), into a Jewish family, to psychologist Solomon Derenkowsky and Marie Fiedler, who supposedly named her after Italian actress Eleonora Duse.\n\nIn 1922, the family fled the USSR because of anti-Semitic pogroms perpetrated by the White Volunteer Army and moved to Syracuse, New York. Her father shortened the family name to \"Deren\" shortly after they arrived in New York. He became the staff psychiatrist at the State Institute for the Feeble-Minded in Syracuse.\n\nIn 1928, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Her mother moved to Paris, France to be with her daughter while she attended the League of Nations International School of Geneva in Switzerland from 1930 to 1933.\n\nDeren began college at Syracuse University, where she studied journalism and political science, and also became a highly active socialist leader during the Trotskyist movement. Deren serves as National Secretary in the National Student office of the Young People's Socialist League and was a member of the Social Problems Club at Syracuse University through which she met Gregory Bardacke, whom she married at the age of eighteen in June 1935. After his graduation in 1935, she moved to New York City. She finished school at New York University with a bachelor's degree in literature in June 1936 then returned to Syracuse in the Fall. She and her husband became active in various socialist causes in New York City. She graduated from New York University with a bachelor's degree in literature and separated from Bardacke. The divorce was finalized in 1939. She attended the New School for Social Research and received a master's degree in English literature at Smith College. Her master's thesis was titled \"The Influence of the French Symbolist School on Anglo-American Poetry\" (1939).\n\nAfter graduation from Smith, Deren returned to New York's Greenwich Village, where she joined the European émigré art scene. The following years from 1937–1939 were very formative of career as Deren supported herself by free-lance writing for radio shows and foreign language newspapers. During that time she also worked as an editorial assistant to famous American writers, Eda Lou Walton, Max Eastman, and then William Seabrook. She became known for her European-style handmade clothes, wild, curly hair, and fierce convictions. In 1940, Deren moved to Los Angeles to focus on her poetry and free-lance photography. In 1941, Deren wrote and suggested a children's book on dance to African American dancer, choreographer, and anthropologist of Caribbean culture and dance Katherine Dunham and later became her assistant and publicist. Dunham's fieldwork influenced Deren's studies of Haitian culture and Voudoun mythology. At the end of touring a new musical \"Cabin in the Sky\", the Dunham dance company stopped in Los Angeles for several months to work in Hollywood. It was there that Deren met Alexandr Hackenschmied (later Hammid), a celebrated Czech-born photographer and cameraman who would become her second husband in 1942. Hackenschmied had fled from Czechoslovakia in 1938 after Hitler's advance. They lived together in Laurel Canyon where he helped her with her still photography which focused on local fruit pickers in Los Angeles.,\n\nIn 1943, Deren purchased a used 16 mm Bolex camera with some of the inheritance money after her father's death from a heart attack. This camera captured her first and best-known film, \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" (1943), made in their Los Angeles home on a budget of $250<ref name=\"Athology Film Archive/Film Culture\"></ref> in collaboration with Hammid. \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" is recognized as a seminal American avant-garde film. It is the first example of a narrative work in avant-garde American film; critics have seen autobiographical elements in the film, as well as thoughts about women and the individual. Originally a silent film with no dialogue, music for the film was composed by Deren's third husband Teiji Itō in 1952. The film can be described as an expressionistic \"trance film,\" full of dramatic angles and innovative editing. It seems to investigate the ephemeral ways in which the protagonist's unconscious mind works and makes connections between objects and situations. A woman, played by Maya Deren, walks to her friend's house in Los Angeles, falls asleep and has a dream. The sequence of walking up to the gate on the partially shaded road restarts numerous times, resisting conventional narrative expectations, and ends in various situations inside the house. Movement from the wind, shadows and the music sustain the heartbeat of the dream. Certain symbols recur on the screen, including a cloaked, mirror-faced figure, and a key, which becomes twinned with a knife.\n\nThe loose repetition and rhythm cut short any expectation of a conventional narrative, heightening the dream-like qualities. The camera initially avoids her face, which precludes identification with a particular woman. Multiple selves appear, shifting between the first and third person, suggesting that the super-ego is at play, which is in line with the psychoanalytic Freudian staircase and flower motifs. This kind of Freudian interpretation, which she disagreed with, led Deren to add sound to the film composed by Teji Ito. Another interpretation is that each film is an example of a \"personal film\". Her first piece explores a woman's subjectivity and her relation to the external world. Georges Sadoul said Deren may have been \"the most important figure in the post-war development of the personal, independent film in the U.S.A.\" In featuring the filmmaker as the woman whose subjectivity in the domestic space is explored, the feminist dictum \"the personal is political\" is foregrounded. As with her other films on self-representation, Deren navigates conflicting tendencies of the self and the \"other,\" through doubling, multiplication and merging of the woman in the film. Following a dreamlike quest with allegorical complexity, \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" has an enigmatic structure and a loose affinity with both film noir and domestic melodrama. The film is famous for how it resonated with Deren's own life and anxieties. According to a review in \"The Moving Image, \"\" this film emerges from a set of concerns and passionate commitments that are native to Deren's life and her trajectory. The first of these trajectories is Deren's interest in socialism during her youth and university years\".\n\nThere is no concrete information about the conception of \"Meshes of the Afternoon, \"just that Deren offered the poetic ideas and Hammid was able to turn them into visuals. Deren's initial concept began on the terms of a subjective camera, one that would show the point of view of herself without the aid of mirrors and would move as her eyes through spaces. According to the earliest program note, she describes \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" as\":\"\n\nThis film is concerned with the interior experiences of an individual. It does not record an event which could be witnessed by other persons. Rather, it reproduces the way in which the subconscious of an individual will develop, interpret, and elaborate an apparently simple and casual incident into a critical emotional experience.\n\n\"Meshes of the Afternoon\" resembles a French film called \"Blood of a Poet\" (1930) by Jean Cocteau. The film is a representation of the subjective point of view of the Cocteau's mind in which he grapples with the concepts of inner and outer reality. \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" and Cocteau's film share the same imagery in many instances, however, Deren repeatedly claimed to have never seen the film and denied any influence by Cocteau. After seeing Blood of a Poet for the first time, she actually became fond of Cocteau.\n\nIn the fall of 1945, Deren wrote to Victor Animatograph Corp. that she had seen the film multiple times now and expressed interest in publishing a commentary on it. The article was never written.\n\nThe surrealist background of Dali and Bunuel is a question of influence because of the surreal nature of \"Meshes of the Afternoon\". Bunuel's \"Un Chien Andalou\" (1928) is on the premier examples of film representing the structure of the subconscious.\n\nDeren detested this comparison because of the surrealist movement's interest in the entertainment value of its subject more than its meaning. The form of \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" does not compare to Un Chien Andalou either.\n\nPsychoanalysis of \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" from a Freudian viewer or Jungian viewer attempted to decode the symbolism in the film to uncover what Deren was saying about identity and sexuality. Deren adamantly objected her film undergoing analysis for its symbolism because for Deren, the objects in the film were just that, objects \"whose value and meaning ids defined and confirmed by their actual function in the context of the film as a whole\". Deren wanted her audiences to appreciate the art for its conscious value and spent a lot of her later career delivering lectures and writing essays on her film theory.\n\nAlexander Hamid's role in the creation of \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" is as cameraperson. Maya Deren made extensive storyboards for all of her films including camera movements and camera effects. She wrote about these techniques in professional filmmaking magazines. The ideas and execution of the film are fully attributable to Deren. Hamid also acknowledged Deren as the sole creator of Meshes of the Afternoon.\n\nDeren filmed \"At Land\" in Port Jefferson and Amagansett, New York in the summer of 1944. Taking on more of an environmental psychologist's perspective, Deren \"externalizes the hidden dynamic of the external world...as if I had moved from a concern with the life of the fish, to a concern with the sea which accounts for the character of the fish and its life.\" Maya Deren washes up on the shore of the beach, and climbs up a piece of driftwood that leads to a room lit by chandeliers, and one long table filled with men and women smoking. She seems to be invisible to the people as she crawls across the table, uninhibited; her body continues seamlessly again onto a new frame, crawling through foliage; following the flowing pattern of water on rocks; following a man across a farm, to a sick man in bed, through a series of doors, and finally popping up outside on a cliff. She shrinks in the wide frame as she walks farther away from the camera, up and down sand dunes, then frantically collecting rocks back on the shore. Her expression seems confused when she sees two women playing chess in the sand. She runs back through the entire sequence, and because of the jump-cuts, it seems as though she is a double or \"doppelganger,\" where her earlier self sees her other self running through the scene. Some of her movements are controlled, suggesting a theatrical, dancer-like quality, while some have an almost animalistic sensibility as she crawls through the seemingly foreign environments. This is one of Deren's films in which the focus is on the character's exploration of her own subjectivity in her physical environment, inside as well as outside her subconscious, although it has a similar amorphous quality compared to her other films.\n\nIn the spring of 1945 she made \"A Study in Choreography for Camera,\" which Deren said was \"an effort to isolate and celebrate the principle of the power of movement.\" The compositions and varying speeds of movement within the frame inform and interact with Deren's meticulous edits and varying film speeds and motions to create a dance that Deren said could only exist on film. Excited by the way the dynamic of movement is greater than anything else within the film, Maya established a completely new sense of the word \"geography\" as the movement of the dancer transcends and manipulates the ideas of both time and space. Running at just under 3 minutes long, \"A Study in Choreography for Camera\" is a fragment but also a carefully constructed exploration of a man who dances in a forest, and then seems to teleport to the inside of a house because of how continuous his movements are from one place to the next. The choreography is perfectly synched as he seamlessly appears in an outdoor courtyard and then returns to an open, natural space. It shows a progression from nature to the confines of society, and back to nature. The figure belongs to dancer and choreographer Talley Beatty, whose last movement is a leap across the screen back to the natural world. The edit its broken, choppy, showing different angles and compositions, and even with parts in slow-motion, Deren is able to keep the quality of the leap smooth and seemingly uninterrupted.\n\nBy her fourth film, Deren discussed in \"An Anagram\" that she felt special attention should be given to unique possibilities of time and that the form should be ritualistic as a whole. \"Ritual in Transfigured Time\" began in August and was completed in 1946. It explored the fear of rejection and the freedom of expression in abandoning ritual, looking at the details as well as the bigger ideas of the nature and process of change. The main roles were played by Deren and the dancers Rita Christiani and Frank Westbrook.\n\nDeren's \"Meditation on Violence\" was made in 1948. Chao-Li Chi's performance obscures the distinction between violence and beauty. It was an attempt to \"abstract the principle of ongoing metamorphosis,\" found in \"Ritual in Transfigured Time,\" though Deren felt it was not as successful in the clarity of that idea, brought down by its philosophical weight. Halfway through the film, the sequence is rewound, producing a film loop.\n\nDeren defined cinema as an art, provided an intellectual context for film viewing, and filled a theoretical gap for the kinds of independent films societies were featuring.\n\nHer entrepreneurial spirit became evident as she began to screen and distribute her films in the United States, Canada, and Cuba, lecturing and writing on avant-garde film theory, and Vodoun as well. In February 1946 she booked the Village's Provincetown Playhouse for a major public exhibition, titled \"Three Abandoned Films\", in which she showed \"Meshes of the Afternoon,\" \"At Land,\" and \"A Study in Choreography for the Camera.\" The event was completely sold out, inspiring Amos Vogel's formation of Cinema 16, the most successful film society of the 1950s.\n\nIn 1946, she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for \"Creative Work in the Field of Motion Pictures,\" and won the Grand Prix Internationale for 16mm experimental film at the Cannes Film Festival for \"Meshes of the Afternoon.\" She then created a scholarship for experimental filmmakers, the Creative Film Foundation.\n\nIn 1958, Deren collaborated with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School and Antony Tudor to create \"The Very Eye of Night\".\n\nDeren was a muse and inspiration to such up-and-coming avant-garde filmmakers as Curtis Harrington, Stan Brakhage, and Kenneth Anger, who emulated her independent, entrepreneurial spirit. Her influence can also be seen in films by Carolee Schneemann, Barbara Hammer, and Su Friedrich.\n\nIn 1943, she moved to a bungalow on Kings Road in Hollywood and adopted the name Maya, a pet name her husband Hammid coined. Maya is the name of the mother of the historical Buddha as well as the dharmic concept of the illusory nature of reality. In Greek myth, Maia is the mother of Hermes and a goddess of mountains and fields.\n\nIn 1944, back in New York City, her social circle included Marcel Duchamp, André Breton, John Cage, and Anaïs Nin. In 1944, Deren filmed \"The Witch's Cradle\" in Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century gallery with Duchamp featured in the film, and possibly assisting her in the direction of the film.\n\nMany friends described her look as that of an exotic Russian Jew, contributing a part of her attractiveness to her bohemian, Greenwich Village lifestyle. In the December 1946 issue of \"Esquire\" magazine, a caption for her photograph teased that she \"experiments with motion pictures of the subconscious, but here is finite evidence that the lady herself is infinitely photogenic.\" Her third husband, Teiji Ito said \"Maya was always a Russian. In Haiti she was a Russian. She was always dressed up, talking, speaking many languages and being a Russian.\"\n\nThroughout the 1940s and 50s, Deren attacked Hollywood for its artistic, political and economic monopoly over American cinema. She stated, \"I make my pictures for what Hollywood spends on lipstick,\" and observed that Hollywood \"has been a major obstacle to the definition and development of motion pictures as a creative fine-art form.\" She set herself in opposition to the Hollywood film industry's standards and practices.\nDeren talks about the freedoms of independent cinema:\n\nWhen Maya Deren decided to make an ethnographic film in Haiti, she was criticized for abandoning avant-garde film where she had made her name, but she was ready to expand to a new level as an artist. She had studied ethnographic footage by Gregory Bateson in Bali in 1947, and was interested in including it in her next film. In September she divorced Hammid and left for a nine-month stay in Haiti. The Guggenheim Fellowship grant in 1947 enabled Deren to finance her travel and complete her film \"Meditation on Violence.\" She went on three additional trips through 1954 to document and record the rituals of Haitian Vodou.\n\nA source of inspiration for ritual dance was Katherine Dunham who wrote her master's thesis on Haitian dances in 1939, which Deren edited. Afterwards Deren wrote several articles on religious possession in dancing before her first trip to Haiti. Deren not only filmed, recorded and photographed many hours of Vodou ritual, but also participated in the ceremonies. She documented her knowledge and experience of Vodou in \"Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti\" (New York: Vanguard Press, 1953), edited by Joseph Campbell, which is considered a definitive source on the subject. She described her attraction to Vodou possession ceremonies, transformation, dance, play, games and especially ritual came from her strong feeling on the need to decenter our thoughts of self, ego and personality. In her book \"An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form, and Film\" she wrote:\n\nDeren filmed 18,000 feet of Vodou rituals and people she met in Haiti. The footage was incorporated into a posthumous documentary film \"\", edited and produced in 1977 (with funding from Deren's friend James Merrill) by Teiji Itō (1935-1982) and his wife Cherel Winett Itō (1947–1999). All of the original wire recordings, photographs and notes are held in the Maya Deren Collection at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University. The film footage is housed at Anthology Film Archives in New York City.\n\nAn LP of some of Deren's wire recordings was published by the newly formed Elektra Records in 1953 entitled \"Voices of Haiti\". The cover art for the album was by Teiji Ito.\n\nAnthropologists Melville Herkovitz and Harold Courlander acknowledged the importance of \"Divine Horsemen,\" and in contemporary studies it is often cited as an authoritative voice, where Deren's methodology has been especially praised because \"Vodou has resisted all orthodoxies, never mistaking surface representations for inner realities.\" \n\nIn her book of the same name, Deren uses the spelling,'Voudoun,' explaining: \"Voudoun terminology, titles and ceremonies still make use of the original African words and in this book they have been spelled out according to usual English phonetics and so as to render, as closely as possible, the Haitian pronunciation. Most of the songs, sayings and even some of the religious terms, however, are in Creole, which is primarily French in derivation (although it also contains African, Spanish and Indian words). Where the Creole word retains its French meaning, it has been written out so as to indicate both the original French word and the distinctive Creole pronunciation.\" In her Glossary of Creole Words, Deren includes 'Voudoun' while the \"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\" draws attention to the similar French word, \"Vaudoux.\"\n\nDeren died in 1961, at the age of 44, from a brain hemorrhage brought on by extreme malnutrition. Her condition may have also been weakened by her long-term dependence on amphetamines and sleeping pills prescribed by Dr. Max Jacobson, an arts scene doctor notorious for his liberal prescription of drugs, who later became famous as one of President Kennedy's physicians. Her father suffered from hypertension, which she may also have had.\n\nHer ashes were scattered in Japan at Mount Fuji.\n\nDeren was a key figure in the creation of a New American Cinema, highlighting personal, experimental, underground film. In 1986, the American Film Institute created the Maya Deren Award to honor independent filmmakers.\n\n\"The Legend of Maya Deren, Vol. 1 Part 2\" consists of hundreds of documents, interviews, oral histories, letters, and autobiographical memoirs.\n\nWorks about Deren and her works have been produced in various media:\n\nDeren's films have also been shown with newly written alternative soundtracks:\n\nDeren was also an important film theorist. \n\n\n"}

Santorum does not believe the right to privacy under the United States Constitution covers sexual acts, and criticized the US Supreme Court ruling in the case of \"Lawrence v. Texas\" that ruled to the contrary. Santorum has stated that the U.S. military's \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy, which ended in 2011, should be reinstated and has voiced his opposition to same-sex parenting. Santorum's views provoked criticism from Democratic politicians and other groups, but have been supported by some conservative Christians.\n\nIn the interview by Associated Press reporter Lara Jakes Jordan, when asked for his position on the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal, Santorum said that the scandal involved priests and post-pubescent men in \"a basic homosexual relationship\" (rather than child sexual abuse), which led the interviewer to ask if homosexuality should be outlawed.\n\nSantorum then brought up the then-pending U.S. Supreme Court case \"Lawrence v. Texas\", which challenged a Texas sodomy law, and said that \"he did not have a problem with homosexuals, but a problem with homosexual acts\", \"the right to privacy doesn't exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution\", and \"sodomy laws properly exist to prevent acts which undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family.\"\n\nWhen Jordan asked \"Okay, without being too gory or graphic, so if somebody is homosexual, you would argue that they should not have sex?\" Santorum stated:\nThe AP also quoted Santorum as saying, \"If the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything.\" and \"Whether it's polygamy, whether it's adultery, whether it's sodomy, all of those things, are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family.\"\n\nWhen allegations of bias were leveled against Jordan because she is married to a Democratic strategist, she made a recording of the interview available. The AP released a transcript it described as \"an unedited section\" of the interview on April 23.\n\nSantorum's comments evoked responses ranging from George W. Bush's remark, relayed through spokesperson Ari Fleischer, that \"the President believes that the senator is an inclusive man\", to sharp criticism from former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean that \"gay-bashing is not a legitimate public policy discussion; it is immoral\", to conservative groups such as the Family Research Council and Concerned Women for America who came to Santorum's defense.\n\nDean called on Santorum, \"to resign from his post as Republican Conference chairman.\" Other Democratic politicians who responded included Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, who remarked that Santorum's comments were \"out of step with our country's respect for tolerance\". The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee demanded that Santorum resign as chairman of the Republican Senate Caucus. Brad Woodhouse of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee called the comments, \"divisive, hurtful and reckless.\" Santorum faced criticism for his comments from Republican Senators including Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins, Lincoln Chafee, and Gordon H. Smith. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona stated, \"I think that he may have been inartful in the way that he described it.\"\n\nCritics of the statement included the Log Cabin Republicans, and the Republican Unity Coalition. LGBT rights groups which condemned the comments by Santorum included the Pennsylvania Gender Rights Coalition, OutFront, the Center for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights, and the Human Rights Campaign. The conservative Christian group Concerned Women for America agreed with Santorum's comments in a written statement. The group said Santorum was \"exactly right\" and attributed criticism of Santorum to the \"gay thought police\". Director of Concerned Women for America's Culture and Family Institute, Robert Knight, criticized those Republicans who spoke out against Santorum, \"Maybe they ought to think about switching parties. It shows great disloyalty to their party to join the sworn enemies in calling for the head [of Santorum]. They're doing their party a great disservice.\" Vice President for Communications at the conservative Family Research Council Genevieve Wood supported Santorum's remarks, and commented, \"I think the Republican party would do well to follow Senator Santorum if they want to see pro-family voters show up on Election Day.\" Conservative publications released articles supporting Santorum's comments, including \"National Review\" with a piece by the philosopher Robert P. George, and Townhall.com in an opinion piece by the political commentator Ben Shapiro.\n\nIn a follow-up statement released after the Associated Press interview was published, Santorum said some of his remarks were \"taken out of context\", and defended his comments in the interview asserting \"It is simply a reflection of the law.\" In an interview with \"Fox News Channel\", Santorum said he was not going to apologize for his remarks, \"I do not need to give an apology based on what I said and what I'm saying now – I think this is a legitimate public policy discussion. These are not ridiculous comments. These are very much a very important point.\" In 2015, during an interview on the Rachel Maddow Show, he expressed regret for associating homosexuality with bestiality.\n\nSantorum defended his remarks, declaring that his comments were not intended to equate homosexuality with incest and adultery, but rather to challenge the specific legal position that the right to privacy prevents the government from regulating consensual acts among adults, a position he disputes, because he does not believe that there is a general constitutional right to privacy.\n\nDan Savage, a widely syndicated columnist who was offended by Santorum's remarks, hosted a contest in his \"Savage Love\" column for readers to create a definition for \"santorum\". He created a website, \"spreadingsantorum.com\", for the winning definition, \"The frothy mix of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex\". This became a top internet search result for \"santorum\" in 2003, displacing the Senator's official website on many search engines, including Google, Yahoo! Search, and Bing. In 2011, during his presidential campaign, Santorum requested Google's assistance to end the return of certain search results, but Google said there was nothing it could do.\n\nWhile campaigning in New Hampshire, Santorum engaged college students who asked about his position on same-sex marriage and suggested that allowing it would lead to the legalization of polygamy and other forms of marriage. The exchange resulted in him being booed at the conclusion of the event. At another event, Santorum said that children would be better off having a father in prison than being raised by lesbian parents.\n\nOn September 22, 2011, during a Republican primary debate in Orlando, Florida, Santorum replied to a question posed by a gay soldier deployed in Iraq who asked the candidates whether, as president, they would take measures to \"circumvent\" the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\". He said:\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1948, and is the first agency of its kind in Canada, predating the Canada Council for the Arts by nine years. The Arts Board has offices located in Regina and Saskatoon, and professional staff is available to consult with artists, arts organizations and community members regarding programs and application process.\n\nThe Arts Board is governed by \"The Arts Board Act, 1997\", and funded by the Government of Saskatchewan through the Ministry of Parks, Culture and Sport, with additional support from the Saskatchewan Lotteries Trust Fund for Sport, Culture and Recreation as a result of the Arts Board's partnership with SaskCulture Inc.\n\nThe importance of the input and feedback of the community it serves is a priority throughout the Arts Board's operations and is formalized within \"The Arts Board Act, 1997\". Although officially appointed by the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council, one-third of the members of the Arts Board’s board of directors is chosen from a list of nominees provided by the arts community. This process assists in ensuring the Arts Board is representative of the thoughts, ideas and directions of the community itself. The board reports to the province’s minister responsible for the Saskatchewan Arts Board.\n\nThe Arts Board offers several funding opportunities and programs for individuals and organizations, including:\n\nThe Arts Board also administers grant and award programs in partnership with other agencies, such as the Access Copyright Foundation and the Saskatchewan Foundation for the Arts.\n\nThe Arts Board's Permanent Collection is a collection of art by Saskatchewan artists. It includes approximately 3,000 works of art in all media by 750 artists and is the largest body of work by Saskatchewan artists in the world.\n\nThe Arts Board makes the Permanent Collection accessible by bringing it to the people of the province in their workplaces, schools and communities. Works form the collection are loaned to galleries and other venues around the province and country for exhibitions, film production, broadcast and publication opportunities. The Arts Board's Art Rental program brings artwork into the office. Art Rental clients are Saskatchewan government departments, agencies, crown corporations, boards, commissions and the corporate sector. Non-profit organizations and institutions may also rent art from the Saskatchewan Arts Board's Permanent Collection.\n\nAnyone is able to suggest work to become part of Permanent Collection either through purchase or donation/bequest. In order to have a fair and transparent policy, the Arts Board receives submissions at two deadlines annually.\n\nOn the occasion of its 40th anniversary in 1988, the Arts Board established the Lifetime Award for Excellence in the Arts. The award honours Saskatchewan individuals whose accomplishments have had a major impact on the arts provincially, nationally and internationally. A listing of recipients from 1988-1999 is on the Saskatchewan Arts Board website.\n\nIn 2004, the awards program expanded and the Arts Board established the Lieutenant Governor’s Arts Awards to recognize the achievements made by individuals, groups and organizations in the arts.\n\nIn 2016, it was renamed the Saskatchewan Arts Awards. In addition to the award, all recipients receive a cash prize. Award categories include Lieutenant Governor's Lifetime Achievement, Emerging Artist, Leadership - Individual, Leadership - Organization, Arts and Learning, and Artistic Excellence.\n\nPast recipients of the Lieutenant Governor's Arts Awards and the Saskatchewan Arts Awards are available on the Saskatchewan Arts Board website.\n\n\nThe Legislative Building Artist in Residence Program was part of the province's year-long celebration in 2012 of the 100th anniversary of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building and was developed in partnership with the Saskatchewan Arts Board. Under the guidance of artist-in-residence coordinator Laura Hale, who also served as a resident artist, the eight participants explored the history and significance of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building through their own artistic disciplines.\n\nEach artist hosted a community engaged project to encourage cultural exchange at the Legislative Building and created a work of art that is displayed in one of the alcoves in the Rotunda of the Legislative Building. The artwork was unveiled in December 2012.\n\n\nThe Artists in the Community project ran from October 2006 to September 2007. It was presented by the Saskatchewan Arts Board in collaboration with the City of Saskatoon, with the financial support of the Government of Canada through the Cultural Capitals of Canada program.\n\nEight community-based residencies were selected from a broad variety of sectors within Saskatoon. Organizational staff, volunteers, community members, managers, and organization clientele had the unique opportunity to work with an artist for six to nine months.\n\nThe Artists in the Community project was presented by the Saskatchewan Arts Board in collaboration with the City of Saskatoon, with the financial support of the Government of Canada through the Cultural Capitals of Canada program, a program of the Department of Canadian Heritage.\n\n\nIn 2004 the Art At Work project was presented by the Saskatchewan Arts Board, in collaboration with the City of Regina, with the financial support of the Government of Canada through the Cultural Capitals of Canada program, a program of the Department of Canadian Heritage.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Arts Board was involved in celebrating Saskatchewan's Centennial in 2005 with two important projects:\n\n\n1948-1956 – Norah McCullough\n\n1956-1957 – Norah McCullough (on leave); Blowden Davies (acting)\n\n1958 – Florence James (acting); Donald Harvey\n\n1959-1960 – Donald Harvey\n\n1961-1968 – N.

{"id": "40248493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40248493", "title": "Sexism in video gaming", "text": "Sexism in video gaming\n\nSexism in video gaming is prejudiced behavior or discrimination based on sex or gender as experienced by people who play and create video games, primarily women. This may manifest as sexual harassment or in the way genders are represented in games, such as when characters are presented according to gender-related tropes and stereotypes.\n\nThe demographics of video game culture have changed since the 1980s and 90s, when video games were perceived as something of interest mainly to young men. Women make up about half of all game players as of the 2010s. This change, as well as publicized incidents of harassment such as the Gamergate controversy in 2014, have contributed to industry professionals and media increasingly paying attention to issues related to sexism in video gaming.\n\nHarassment can involve sexist insults or comments, death or rape threats, demanding sexual favors in exchange for virtual or real money, or criticism of the presence of women and their interests. In some cases, female players are also stalked, whether online or offline.\n\nWomen are sometimes marginalized as \"intruders\", as it is assumed they do not play video games that aren't associated with female players such as the Sims, music video games or casual games. Conversely, insults towards men focus mainly on their alleged lack of manliness for playing \"girl games\" or disliking violent games. As a result, women may face offensive behavior at conventions, competitions or in video games stores. It may affect female gamers, journalists or game developers, even when they are invited to talk at a conference or to present a game. Since the release of the NES, video games advertisements have been accused of strengthening this tendency by targeting only men. In the 1980s, women stopped being represented playing video games in advertisement and scantily clad women started being used on game covers and ads. Some women saw their non-sexualized female character designs rejected, and others reported sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\nAccording to a 2014 survey created by the International Videogame Developers Association about the satisfaction of working in video game development, results show that females claimed insubordination from subordinate male colleagues, a preference for white males in management position, and a preference for males in hiring and promotion. In the same survey, many female developers complained about how peers did not take their video game credentials into serious consideration and reported invitations to \"meetings\" that were actually romantic dates.\n\nSexual harassment occurs frequently in many online settings relating online video games. Specifically, 65% of women report harassment and statistically receive three times as much derogatory or insulting remarks than men. With anonymity masking gamers, women are susceptible to extreme misogynistic and violent remarks.\n\nVideo games conferences have been criticised for using sexualised advertising such as 'booth babes', creating a demeaning image of women, and for failing to stop harassment of female attendees. This has led some to adopt or share codes of conduct for managing these issues.\n\nInsults are frequent in online gaming. However, according to Stephen Toulouse (moderator of the online gaming service Xbox Live), between 2007 and 2012 women were the most frequent target of harassment. However, data from Riot Games lists racism and homophobia at the top. Furthermore, derogatory words for homosexuality are used almost constantly in online gaming.\n\nIn 2012, a study of the Ohio University showed that the same person playing Halo 3 online with a male and a female profile using recorded voice messages received three times more negative comments with the female profile, despite similar game scores. Even welcoming everybody at the beginning of a game could lead to sexist insults against the female profile. A 2015 study of Halo 3 player interactions found that less skilled male players display a tendency to make frequent, nasty comments to female gamers. The researchers suggested that the poorly performing males \"attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank.\"\n\nA study from 2006 showed that 83.4% of gamers had seen the words \"gay\" or \"queer\" used as derogatory names, and that 52.7% of gay gamers perceived the gaming community as \"somewhat hostile\" while 14% perceived it as \"very hostile\".\n\nAccording to Lucy Waterlow, there appears to be a deep history of sexual harassment in the video game industry and women who play video games on online forums such as Call of Duty are often told they should \"return to the kitchen\", along with other slurs. However, the changing demographics that have been seen in the video game community (an increasing proportion of people who play video games are, as it appears, female.), have led to certain consequences. The largest change in terms of who plays video games has been that of gender proportions. This translates to more women playing video games than ever before, “almost reaching parity” with the number of men that play video games. The most visible and immediate ramifications of that have been the resistance of men and even some women within the industry.\n\nCritics have stated that there is an increasing pervasiveness of the sexual harassment of women in the video game community. A study conducted by Kate O'Halloran in 2017 found that women receive an almost amplified amount of harassment in the setting of online video games than they do in real life, whereas preferential treatment is given to men by other men. The difference in the treatment of women further diminishes the desire of women to participate in video games, or, as O'Halloran found, to completely conceal their gender identity and allow other players to assume their gender. Liliana Braumberger, a participant in O'Halloran's study, states that this stems from the fact that the men who engage in this form of sexual harassment have the invisibility and anonymity that comes with participating in an online server, and that men have a certain sense of entitlement that leads to the invisibility of women. She feels that this discrimination and erasure potentially have the same effects on other people who do not identify as men, not necessarily just women.\n\nEvents in 2007 to 2017 brought sexual harassment in video gaming to mainstream media's attention in the United-States, United Kingdom and Germany:\n\n\n\nA study performed by Jesse Fox et al. suggested that due the Proteus effect, manifesting a sexualized character in a video game can have adverse mental effects. They designed a study in which 86 women from West Coast university played a virtual reality game. Women who used sexualized characters that looked like them had a higher rape myth acceptance than those in other conditions, which is the validation of incorrect and stereotypical ideas about rape that blame the victim, and increased body-related thinking which can lead to increased self-objectification. When players immerse themselves into the games they are playing, it allows them to watch their behaviors from an external viewpoint. For some, they become more pleased with their avatar in the video game and it makes them feel good because they get to be the person they want to be. They lose sight of their physical self and match their modified self in the game. Yee and Bailenson found, in a study, that when the players manifest an attractive character, they are more open to talking to another character and will open up more. When women, especially, take over more sexualized characters, they begin to center on the more physical and sexual features, and their opinion start to support the materialization and sexualization of women.\n\nIn 1998, Fredrickson and Roberts created the idea of objectification theory, stating that it was an environment when cultures press both girls and women to socialize in a way that they will begin to form ideas that they should be looked at as objects. It takes away their self worth and causes them to think they are only in their society to be looked at for their bodies, with a purely sexual use. Women begin to hold onto this perspective and believe that their appearance is most important and how they are valued. Combined with the Proteus effect, it is expected that a woman who chooses a more sexualized avatar will objectify themselves more than one who chooses a non-sexualized avatar.\n\nIn another study, 181 students from a private liberal arts college in North Carolina were tested. The group exposed to highly sexualized images, from video games (in comparison to control group), was more tolerant to sexual harassment but showed the same rape myth acceptance. A similar study was done in France, studying young adults being exposed to sexist materials in video games. The sample filled out a survey, which compared how much time they spent playing video games and their attitudes towards women. The results showed that when narrowed down to gender and socioeconomic levels, a connection was made between stronger sexist views and a higher amount of time spent playing video games.\n\nKaren E. Dill and Kathryn P. Thill state that adolescents, particularly boys and those who play games, are ignorant of the adverse impacts of detestable media content, and therefore ignorant of the when they are affected adversely. Theories such as the cultivation theory, social cognitive theory, ambivalent sexism theory, and hegemonic masculinity theory all aid Dill and Thill in discussing the repercussions of perpetuating gender stereotypes in media like video games. Cultivation theory is key to the analysis of sexism in video games, because it is the idea that when an individual is exposed long-term to multimedia, their understanding of their reality can change into becoming more similar to the media. These theories also illustrate the ways prominent video game characters are gendered and what is received by the user or viewer. They write that \"Gender portrayals of video game characters reinforce a sexist, patriarchal view that men are aggressive and powerful and that women are not healthy, whole persons, but sex objects, eye candy and generally second-class citizens.\"\n\nAccording to Jeffrey Kuznekoff and Lindsey Rose, the fact that gamers experience misconstrued portrayals of appearance, violence, and sexual objectification can impact their understanding and communication with other gamers, especially female gamers. In addition, these gender portrayals become increasingly prominent because of the mass appeal and number of users of online multiplayer games. They found that the female voice received nearly three times as many directed negative comments than the male voice or control. They also found that there was no correlation between the number of directed negative comments and the skill level of the other player. On several occasions, the female voice received strong sexist replies for phrases such as \"hi everybody\" or \"alright team let's do this\" despite the female voice having almost the same win percentage as the male voice (56% to 61%, respectively). Additionally, they found that when the other player responded with a positive remark, they were more likely to ask questions. Overall, Kuznekoff and Rose found that there were hypernegative effects with hostile targeting of the female voice.\n\nIn 2015, a three-year German study of 824 gamers found, when controlling for age and education, that there was no correlation between sexist attitudes and time spent playing video games, or with preference for video game genres. The longitudinal study was based on cultivation theory, and the results broadly showed that playing video games did not lead to gamers becoming sexist. The authors Johannes Breuer, Rachel Kowert, Ruth Festl and Thorsten Quandt have, however, been keen \"to make clear that [their] study does not show that sexism is not an issue in/for games and gaming culture. There are many content analyses of popular games that show that female characters are underrepresented or presented in an overly sexualized manner and there is also ample evidence that many players, particularly female, have experienced sexism in their interactions with other players.\"\n\nA study published in May 2016 investigated the common perception of a gender performance gap. The researchers analysed the performance data of over 10,000 players (both men and women) in the online MMORPGs \"Everquest II\" in the United States and \"Chevaliers III\" in China. The study contends that \"perceived gender-based performance disparities seem to result from factors that are confounded with gender (i.e., amount of play), not player gender itself\". Lead author Cuihai Shen stated that if there was a gender disparity favoring men then \"they should advance to higher levels within the same amount of play time\" however their analysis indicated \"women advanced at least as fast as men did in both games\". Shen outlined that there was a difference in play style between the genders, and stated \"women did spend less time playing overall than men, they chose characters that are more assistive, and were more drawn to social interaction and helping others.\n\nA study was conducted on 154 Italian male high school volunteers. They were tasked with playing one of three different types of games. The first was \"Grand Theft Auto\". Females in this game are secondary, usually strippers and prostitutes that are used as sexual objects by players. The second was \"Half Life 1\" and \"Half Life 2\". Although this game is violent, the female character plays a lead role and is not depicted in a sexist or sexual manner. Lastly, there was \"Dream Pinball 3D\" and \"Q.U.B.E. 2\", which contain no violence or sexuality. Afterward, the volunteers were shown one of two pictures that showed females as victims of violence. Participants then rated whether they felt sympathetic, moved, compassionate, tender, warm, softhearted, disregarded or indifferent on a scale of 1, \"not at all\" to 7, \"very much\". The study concluded that those that identified strongly with the male characters in the sexist-violent video game, \"Grand Theft Auto\", showed the least amount of empathy towards the female violence victims. \"The portrayal of men in the media as socially powerful and physically violent reinforces assumptions about how men and boys should act in society, as well as how they should treat women and girls. Exposure to sex-typed media characters can have real world consequence.\"\n\nFemale activists actively promote changes in the way women are portrayed in games and how they are treated by the industry and gaming public as a whole. Media critic Anita Sarkeesian, for example, has – through her organization Feminist Frequency – given lectures and training to help change gaming culture. \n\nA prevailing perception is that the gaming industry is not fit for female workers because of sexism. According to Richard Wilson, CEO of TIGA, \"typically, 80% of the workforce is qualified to degree level or above, but the proportion of women studying subjects such as computer science or games programming courses is low. There is only a comparatively small pool of potential female employees available to work in the games industry.\"\n\nInitiatives on the part of gaming companies include codes of conduct and the adoption of trainings and standards to ensure safe and respectful workplace. In an attempt to combat sexism, the French government in 2016 proposed pieces of legislation that would give bonuses or incentives to video game creators that promote a more positive image of female characters in their games. Furthermore, these proposals outline a rating system that distinguishes games that promote a positive female representation and those that do not, with the latter getting the highest age 18 rating.\n\n"}
{"id": "4519545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4519545", "title": "Sidney Prescott", "text": "Sidney Prescott\n\nSidney Prescott is a fictional character and the primary protagonist of the \"Scream\" franchise. The character was created by Kevin Williamson and is portrayed by Canadian actress Neve Campbell. She first appeared in \"Scream\" (1996) followed by three sequels: \"Scream 2\" (1997), \"Scream 3\" (2000), and \"Scream 4\" (2011). The character appears in the \"Scream\" films as the target of a series of killers who adopt the Ghostface persona, a ghost mask and black cloak, to pursue her. In each film, the Ghostface killers often murder people close to Sidney and taunt her by phone with threats and intimate knowledge of her life or the murder of her mother, leading to a final confrontation where the true killer is revealed.\n\nThe killers that target Sidney have varying motivations ranging from revenge in \"Scream\" to the fame that will come from killing her in \"Scream 2\", due to the fame she herself has obtained as a survivor of the murder spree in the original film. She first becomes the focus of her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) and his friend Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard), Billy seeking revenge for his mother's abandonment following his father's affair with Sidney's mother Maureen Prescott. \"Scream 3\" later reveals that Billy learned of this affair through Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), Sidney's half-brother, himself seeking revenge for his abandonment and rejection by Maureen, sparking the chain of events that permeate each film.\n\nDrew Barrymore was originally cast as Sidney Prescott but scheduling conflicts led to her taking a smaller role, with the lead being offered instead to Campbell, who at the time was starring in the TV show \"Party of Five\". She was hesitant to take another horror role after finishing work on \"The Craft\" (1996) but took the opportunity as it would be her first leading role in a feature film. Campbell reprised the role in \"Scream 2\" and \"Scream 3\" though her own scheduling conflicts meant she could only film for a short period of time while the third film was in production. This resulted in her character's role being reduced significantly from prior installments and focus was shifted onto the series' other lead characters, Gale Weathers and Dewey Riley. Campbell initially refused requests to return for \"Scream 4\", with scripts written with her character's absence in mind, but ultimately agreed to return.\n\nThe character is depicted as an intelligent, resourceful young woman who slowly becomes stronger over the course of the series as she attempts to overcome the threats and deaths around her. Neve Campbell's role as Sidney Prescott has received significant critical praise throughout the series, earning her the title of Scream Queen in the 1990s and won her the Saturn Award for Best Actress in 1997 for \"Scream\" and the MTV Award for Best Female Performance in 1998 for her role in \"Scream 2\".\n\nSidney Prescott first appeared in the 1996 film \"Scream\" as a teenager attending the fictional Woodsboro High School. After a series of brutal murders occur on the anniversary of her mother's death, the killer begins targeting Sidney herself with attacks and taunting phone calls. Her character has appeared in each successive film in the series, her role initially that of the victim but growing into heroine where she personally confronts each killer and defeats them.\n\nSidney Prescott's first cinematic appearance was in the film \"Scream\" (1996) as a 17-year-old in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California. During a spree of grisly murders, she begins to receive taunting and threatening phone calls from Ghostface, who claims to have knowledge of the brutal rape and murder of Maureen Prescott, Sidney's mother, which occurred one year prior to the events of the film, a murder that is blamed on Cotton Weary. Suspicion falls on several characters before both her boyfriend Billy Loomis and his friend Stu Macher are revealed to both be the killer. Billy states his motivation as revenge following his mother abandoning him over his father's affair with Maureen. With help from Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), Sidney is able to kill Stu and Billy and survive the events of the film.\n\nSidney's second appearance was in \"Scream 2\" (1997) as a student at the fictional Windsor College in the age of 18 where a new series of Ghostface murders occur. The killers again taunt Sidney and murder her friends including Randy Meeks before her friend Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) reveals himself as the killer and murders her new boyfriend, Derek, in front of her. Mickey states his motivation as the fame that will come from his exploits including the murder of Sidney and reveals his accomplice, Mrs. Loomis (Laurie Metcalf), seeking revenge against Sidney for the death of her son Billy. Mrs. Loomis betrays and kills Mickey, intending to disappear without trace after killing Sidney, but before she can enact her plan, Cotton intervenes and shoots her, saving Sidney, who then shoots Mrs. Loomis in the head, killing her.\n\nThe third appearance of Sidney occurred in \"Scream 3\" (2000) where another murder spree begins in Hollywood, with the killer leaving photos of a young Maureen Prescott at the scenes. Sidney, at the age of 21 now a crisis counselor for women, has been in hiding following the events of \"Scream\" and \"Scream 2\" but is drawn to the set of \"Stab 3\", the film within a film based on Sidney and her experiences, after the new Ghostface discovers her location. Ghostface claims responsibility for the murder of Maureen Prescott and is unmasked as the director of \"Stab 3\", Roman Bridger, Sidney's previously unknown half-brother. Roman reveals that their mother was gang raped and impregnated with him during a two-year period where she moved to Hollywood to become an actress, before she met Sidney's father. After being given up for adoption, an adult Roman sought her out only for her to reject him. Roman began stalking Maureen, filming her adulterous liaisons with other men, including the father of Billy Loomis, and used this footage to convince Billy to murder Maureen, unknowingly setting in motion the events of \"Scream\" and \"Scream 2\". Sidney manages to defeat Roman, with Dewey Riley's (David Arquette) help and finally move on with her life.\n\nSidney's fourth appearance was in \"Scream 4\" (2011), set ten years after the events of \"Scream 3\". After returning to the town of Woodsboro to publicize her new book, \"Out of Darkness\" - a self-help book about overcoming the events of her life - a new Ghostface begins attacking the town and leaves evidence in Sidney's car. Becoming a suspect in the murders, Sidney, now the age of 30, stays in town with her cousin Jill Roberts (Emma Roberts) and aunt Kate (Mary McDonnell) but the family becomes embroiled in the Ghostface murder spree. Sidney tries to save Jill from being attacked only to discover that Jill is the killer with her accomplice Charlie Walker (Rory Culkin), Jill hoping to recreate the events of Billy and Stu's murder spree to make herself the Sidney of a \"new generation\" with all the associated fame. Jill stabs Sidney and Charlie, before brutalizing herself to appear the \"sole survivor\", but after arriving at hospital she discovers Sidney has survived. When Jill attempts to finally kill her cousin, Sidney manages to shoot Jill in the chest.\n\nThe role of Sidney Prescott was initially given to actress Drew Barrymore after Barrymore herself approached the production, having read the script, to request the role and was signed to the film before a director had even been found. Wes Craven, after being hired as director, commented that he was able to have bigger actors in the film than his budget allowed because of Barrymore's desire to be involved, which he believed helped attract other big names to the production. While early development on the film took place, however, Barrymore's schedule commitments meant she was no longer able to remain in the demanding leading role, but still wishing to take part she volunteered to play the smaller role of Casey Becker, who dies early in the film, with her scene being filmed in five days. Following Barrymore's abdication of the role, actresses Alicia Witt and Brittany Murphy auditioned for the part. The production also offered the role to Reese Witherspoon although she ultimately never auditioned. It was Canadian actress Neve Campbell who was given the lead of Sidney Prescott after Craven saw her in the television series \"Party of Five\", believing she could best embody a character who was \"innocent\" but also able to handle herself while dealing with the demanding physicality and emotions of the role. Campbell herself was reluctant to undertake a role in another horror film so soon after taking part in \"The Craft\" (1996), but agreed to \"Scream\" as it would be her first leading role and she \"adored\" the character saying \"She's a fantastic character for any kind of movie.\" Campbell and her on-screen boyfriend Skeet Ulrich had previously starred together in \"The Craft\" which they believed helped make their performance of the relationship between Sidney and Ulrich's character, Billy Loomis, more natural.\n\nOn how she approached the leading role in the series, Campbell stated:\n\nKevin Williamson had submitted treatments for two possible sequels to \"Scream\" before the film was even released and so Campbell had been contracted for \"Scream 2\" when she signed on to the original film as she played the only character guaranteed to survive the film. However, scheduling became an issue for Campbell and the production as, at the time, she was still starring in \"Party of Five\".\n\nFor \"Scream 3\", Craven insisted that convincing Campbell and the other principal cast to return was not a problem, but scheduling Campbell's availability with the film's production again became an issue, with Campbell starring not only in \"Party of Five\" but three other feature films. Her availability was limited enough that she was only available for 20 days of filming which resulted in a significantly reduced role for her character and a shift in focus to Cox and Arquette's characters of Gale Weathers and Dewey Riley respectively.\n\nWhen production of \"Scream 4\" was announced, nearly ten years after the last installment of the series, Campbell initially refused offers to reprise her role as Sidney, forcing early script drafts to be written in consideration of her absence while again shifting focus on to Cox and Arquette's roles. However, by September 2009, Campbell was confirmed as reprising her role in the film. Early versions of Williamson's \"Scream 4\" script involved Campbell's character being attacked and killed in the opening, a key point of contention for Bob Weinstein, head of \"Scream\" developer Dimension Films, who had it removed.\n\nOn her character of Sidney Prescott, Neve Campbell spoke positively, saying she \"adored\" the character and \"She's a fantastic character for any kind of movie.\" In 1997, the \"Scream\" role won Campbell the Saturn Award for Best Actress and an MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance nomination. The following year, she went on to win the 1998 Best Female Performance for \"Scream 2\" and received a second Best Actress nomination from the Saturn Awards, losing to Jodie Foster for \"Contact\" (1997). She received a third and final Best Female Performance nomination from MTV in 2000 for the character in \"Scream 3\" but lost to fellow \"Scream\" series alum Sarah Michelle Gellar for \"Cruel Intentions\" (2000).\n\nJohn Muir, author of \"Wes Craven: The Art of Horror\", praised the development of Sidney Prescott in \"Scream 2\" labeling her character, amongst others, \"beloved\".\n\nRoger Ebert, heavily critical of the cast and film of \"Scream 3\", singled out Campbell's role for praise saying \"The camera loves her. She could become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute\". Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News was considerably less complimentary of Campbell, saying \"She adds ZERO coolness. Zero talent. And Zero charisma to [\"Scream 3\"].\"\n\nBryan Enk and Adam Swiderski of UGO ranked Neve Campbell as the 8th greatest Scream Queen for her role as Sidney Prescott, saying \"in the 1990s, Neve was pretty much the number-one scream queen around.\"\n\n"}

The film won Nandi Awards for Best lyrics, Best Male Playback Singer, Best Cinematography and Best Supporting Actress. The film was screened at the Asia Pacific Film Festival, the International Film Festival of India, the Moscow Film Festival and the AISFM Film Festival. The film was shot in Jaipur and Kerala. The film had Hariprasad Chaurasia's flute rendering and a cameo of drummer Sivamani. The film was dubbed in Tamil as \"Raaga Devathai\".\n\nHari Prasad (Sarvadaman Banerjee), a blind flutist lives along with his younger sister in a village near Jaipur, which was also a tourist attraction. Though he lacks knowledge of classical music, he plays flute beautifully and makes a living by playing it to tourists. One day, guide Jyothirmai (Moon Moon Sen) comes there along with a bunch of tourists and listens to his flute. She understands his talent and helps him understand nature and to become a famous flutist. Years pass and Hari Prasad becomes Pandit Hari Prasad. Unknown to her, Hari Prasad admires her very much and dedicates all his albums to her. Meanwhile, a mute painter Subhashini (Suhasini) who meets him in his village, falls for him.\n\nSubhashini expresses her feelings through her paintings and gradually her brother understands her feelings regarding Hari Prasad. He approaches Hari Prasad's uncle with a marriage proposal. But at the same time Hari Prasad reveals his admiration for Jyothirmai. This shocks Jyothirmai as she previously worked as an escort to rich tourists. She tries to hint Hari Prasad about her not so decent past, but is overwhelmed by his pure love and disregard for her external characters. Though she herself admires him, she feels that she would taint him with her impure past. She tells Hari Prasad that she couldn't marry him as she already engaged to a doctor. Hari Prasad takes it well as he always wanted Jyothirmai to be happy.\n\nOn the wedding day, Jyothirmai commits suicide and requests in her last note that her eyes should be donated to Hari Prasad. She also requests that her funeral procession should appear like a marriage procession and her death should be hidden from Hari Prasad. Everyone tries to act normal and sends her as they are sending a bride to her in-laws. Hari Prasad keeps calm all the time and at last goes to the graveyard to say his final goodbyes to Jyothirmai. He tells shocked Subhashini that it's impossible to hide the death of his angel from him. The film ends with Hari Prasad and Subhashini mourning silently in the graveyard.\n\n\n\"Sirivennela\" abounds in classical music composed by K. V. Mahadevan with flute renditions by the renowned flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia. The movie saw the debut of Sirivennela Sitaramasastri as a lyricist, who wrote all of the songs. Because of \"the wonderful songs,\" rich in meaning, he penned for the movie, Sitarama Sastry has taken the name Sirivennela. Each of the songs is remembered to this day.\n\nThe song \"Vidhata Thalapuna\", sung by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and P. Susheela, is about Aum, the most sacred syllable in Hinduism, from which the Veda traditions originated. Other notable songs include \"Adibhikshuvu Vadinedi Koredhi\" and \"Ee gali Ee Nela.\"\n"}

Originally manufactured winter 1964-65, and offered for sale March 1965, the work is one of a famous series of disrupted chess sets referred to as \"Fluxchess\" or \"Flux Chess\", made for George Maciunas' Fluxshop at his Canal Street loft, SoHo, New York City and later through his Fluxus Mail-Order Warehouse. \n\n\"Takako Saito engaged with Duchamp's practice but also with masculinist cold war metaphors by taking up chess as a subject of [her] art. Saito's fluxchess works... question the primacy of vision to chess, along with notions of perception and in aesthetic experience more generally... Her \"Smell Chess,\" \"Sound Chess\" and \"Weight Chess\" reworked the game of chess so that players would be forced to hone non-visual perception, such as the olfactory sense, tactility, and aurality, in order to follow chess rules.\" Claudia Mesch\n\nThe set follows the normal rules of chess, but replaces the traditional pieces with identically-shaped transparent plastic vials filled with different spices for each of the different pieces. The set includes white pawns made of Cinnamon, white rooks of Nutmeg, the white knights are Ginger, black bishops, Cumin and the Black King made of Asafoetida. The white Queen is Anise, the black Cayenne pepper. The board is also made of transparent plastic. To start the game, both players have to familiarise themselves with each of the 12 smells involved, instead of the more normal reliance on sight.\n\nAs a 'basically untrained' artist in Tokyo, Saito's opportunities to exhibit work were severely limited. After taking English lessons, Saito arrived in New York in 1963 on a work visa as an assistant textile wholesaler, 'vaguely [dreaming] of engaging herself in the unknown New York avant-garde'. Unaware of Fluxus, she concentrated on her own work for a few months before meeting George Maciunas through a mutual friend, Ay-O. An admirer of Japanese art, Maciunas asked Saito if she could make boxes similar to the Paulownia boxes he owned, which had been made to protect expensive ceramics. Her skill exceeded expectations, leading him to write that 'her craftmanship springs from Japanese tradition for perfection and is unmatched among contemporary artists working in wood and paper.' \n\nMaciunas revered Marcel Duchamp, and 'found it amusing that both Duchamp and he were chess fanatics.' As a homage to Duchamp's assertion that 'all chess players are artists', Maciunas asked Saito to create a series of artworks based on chess in late 1964. The series she created relegated or removed the dominant visual aspect of the game, replacing it with sets that relied upon the honing of other senses to play. \n\n'In Saito's chess, strategy is undermined by the physical need to utilize the five senses...by involving senses that were normally unrelated to the traditional game, Saito transformed the ultimate conceptual game into a play of sensuous interactions.' \n\nAs well as \"Spice Chess\", the series includes \"Sound Chess\" (different objects hidden in identical sealed boxes), \"Grinder Chess\" (a series of tactile drill bit polishers), \"Weight Chess\" (different weights hidden in sealed boxes), \"Nut & Bolt Chess\" (the only known example having been lost ), \"Jewel Chess\", (made from different fake jewels) and \"Smell Chess\" (different liquids in vials). All of these sets were advertised for sale in Maciunas' Fluxus shop in SoHo, March 1965.\n\n\"When I gave all the chess sets to George, I said, 'he can use them as fluxus chess without mentioning my name.\" Takako Saito \n\nMaciunas was said to be so delighted by \"Spice Chess\" that he 'even took credit for it on occasion.' \n\nOther \"Fluxchess\" sets were made by Maciunas (\"Color Balls in Bottle Board Chess\", March 1966 and \"Time Chess\" made of sand timers, May 1966) and by Yoko Ono, (\"Pieces Hidden In Look-a-Like Containers\" intended for the Fluxfest April 1970 Saito added \"Chess Board Door\" to the series in 1973, in which a chess board was to be attached to a toilet door allowing for a game to continue whilst one of the players was on the loo, and \"Liquor Chess\", 1975 (see ) in which players have to taste various different drinks to ascertain each piece's value. \"Wine Chess\" and \"Book Chess\" have been added to the series since Maciunas' death.\n\nThe most famous of these disrupted sets, Yoko Ono's \"White Chess Set\" (see Yoko Ono's Myspace ), in which all the pieces are white on a totally white board (with a brass plaque underneath reading 'Chess Set for playing as long as you can remember where all your pieces are' ) was originally made for Ono's exhibition at Indica Gallery, London, 1966, and was never produced as a Fluxus edition.\n\n\"Yoko Ono's \"White Chess Set\", in which the opponents' pieces, all white, sit on each side of an all-white board, [make] the warring factions indistinguishable from one another. This elegantly placed anti-war statement, particularly taken in the context of the Vietnam War...[draws] attention to the deeply militaristic metaphors embedded in... games by conscientiously objecting to their implicit narratives of combat and enmity.\"\n\nThe piece has been reconfigured a number of times, including an edition of 20 produced by Bag Productions, UK, 1970, and as \"Play It By Trust\", a white table with ten sets and twenty white chairs laid out at the Vrej Baghoomian Gallery, New York, 1991.\n\nThe sets were originally sold through Maciunas' newly opened Fluxshop in unsigned, unattributed and unnumbered editions. At least one set, \"Grinder Chess\", was remade in an edition of 19 signed and numbered in 1990 as part of the \"Reflux\" editions series.\n\nBefore Hendrick's seminal \"Fluxus Codex\" was published in 1989, there was a general confusion concerning dates and authorship of the key Fluxus pieces, since few were ever sold, and even fewer were signed or dated. Saito's place within the group has gradually become more established, and the playing of \"Fluxchess\" has become an integral part of a number of recent Fluxus exhibitions. An original example of \"Spice Chess\" is one of a number of \"Fluxchess\" sets held in the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection, Detroit, Michigan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "302445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302445", "title": "Stylistics", "text": "Stylistics\n\nStylistics, a branch of applied linguistics, is the study and interpretation of texts of all types and/or spoken language in regard to their linguistic and tonal style, where style is the particular variety of language used by different individuals and/or in different situations or settings. For example, the vernacular, or everyday language may be used among casual friends, whereas more formal language, with respect to grammar, pronunciation or accent, and lexicon or choice of words, is often used in a cover letter and resumé and while speaking during a job interview. \n\nAs a discipline, stylistics link literary criticism to linguistics. It does not function as an autonomous domain on its own, and it can be applied to an understanding of literature and journalism as well as linguistics. Sources of study in stylistics may range from canonical works of writing to popular texts, and from advertising copy to news, non-fiction, and popular culture, as well as to political and religious discourse. Indeed, as recent work in critical stylistics, multimodal stylistics and mediated stylistics has made clear, non-literary texts may be of just as much interest to stylisticians as literary ones. Literariness, in other words, is here conceived as 'a point on a cline rather than as an absolute'.\n\nStylistics as a conceptual discipline may attempt to establish principles capable of explaining particular choices made by individuals and social groups in their use of language, such as in the literary production and reception of genre, the study of folk art, in the study of spoken dialects and registers, and can be applied to areas such as discourse analysis as well as literary criticism.\n\nCommon features of style include the use of dialogue, including regional accents and individual dialects (or ideolects), the distribution of sentence lengths, the use of particular language registers, and so on. In addition, stylistics is a distinctive term that may be used to determine the connections between the form and effects within a particular variety of language. Therefore, stylistics looks at what is 'going on' within the language; what the linguistic associations are that the style of language reveals.\n\nThe analysis of literary style goes back to the study of classical rhetoric, though modern stylistics has its roots in Russian Formalism and the related Prague School of the early twentieth century.\n\nIn 1909, Charles Bally's \"Traité de stylistique française\" had proposed stylistics as a distinct academic discipline to complement Saussurean linguistics. For Bally, Saussure's linguistics by itself couldn't fully describe the language of personal expression. Bally's programme fitted well with the aims of the Prague School.\n\nTaking forward the ideas of the Russian Formalists, the Prague School built on the concept of \"foregrounding\", where it is assumed that poetic language is considered to stand apart from non-literary background language, by means of \"deviation\" (from the norms of everyday language) or \"parallelism\". According to the Prague School, however, this background language isn't constant, and the relationship between poetic and everyday language is therefore always shifting.\n\nRoman Jakobson had been an active member of the Russian Formalists and the Prague School, before emigrating to America in the 1940s. He brought together Russian Formalism and American New Criticism in his \"Closing Statement\" at a conference on stylistics at Indiana University in 1958. Published as \"Linguistics and Poetics\" in 1960, Jakobson's lecture is often credited with being the first coherent formulation of stylistics, and his argument was that the study of poetic language should be a sub-branch of linguistics. The \"poetic function\" was one of six general functions of language he described in the lecture.\n\nMichael Halliday is an important figure in the development of British stylistics. His 1971 study \"Linguistic Function and Literary Style: An Inquiry into the Language of William Golding's The Inheritors\" is a key essay. One of Halliday's contributions has been the use of the term register to explain the connections between language and its context. For Halliday register is distinct from dialect. Dialect refers to the habitual language of a particular user in a specific geographical or social context. Register describes the choices made by the user, choices which depend on three variables: \"field\" (\"what the participants... are actually engaged in doing\", for instance, discussing a specific subject or topic), \"tenor\" (who is taking part in the exchange) and \"mode\" (the use to which the language is being put).\n\nFowler comments that different fields produce different language, most obviously at the level of vocabulary (Fowler. 1996, 192) The linguist David Crystal points out that Halliday's 'tenor' stands as a roughly equivalent term for 'style', which is a more specific alternative used by linguists to avoid ambiguity (Crystal. 1985, 292). Halliday's third category, \"mode\", is what he refers to as the symbolic organisation of the situation. Downes recognises two distinct aspects within the category of mode and suggests that not only does it describe the relation to the medium: written, spoken, and so on, but also describes the genre of the text (Downes. 1998, 316). Halliday refers to genre as pre-coded language, language that has not simply been used before, but that predetermines the selection of textual meanings. The linguist William Downes makes the point that the principal characteristic of register, no matter how peculiar or diverse, is that it is obvious and immediately recognisable (Downes. 1998, 309).\n\nIn \"The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language\", Crystal observes that, in practice, most stylistic analysis has attempted to deal with the complex and 'valued' language within literature, i.e. 'literary stylistics'. He goes on to say that in such examination the scope is sometimes narrowed to concentrate on the more striking features of literary language, for instance, its 'deviant' and abnormal features, rather than the broader structures that are found in whole texts or discourses. For example, the compact language of poetry is more likely to reveal the secrets of its construction to the stylistician than is the language of plays and novels (Crystal. 1987, 71).\n\nAs well as conventional styles of language there are the unconventional – the most obvious of which is poetry. In \"Practical Stylistics\", HG Widdowson examines the traditional form of the epitaph, as found on headstones in a cemetery. For example:<br>\n\nWiddowson makes the point that such sentiments are usually not very interesting and suggests that they may even be dismissed as 'crude verbal carvings' and crude verbal disturbance (Widdowson, 3). Nevertheless, Widdowson recognises that they are a very real attempt to convey feelings of human loss and preserve affectionate recollections of a beloved friend or family member. However, what may be seen as poetic in this language is not so much in the formulaic phraseology but in where it appears. The verse may be given undue reverence precisely because of the sombre situation in which it is placed. Widdowson suggests that, unlike words set in stone in a graveyard, poetry is unorthodox language that vibrates with inter-textual implications (Widdowson. 1992, 4).\n\nTwo problems with a stylistic analysis of poetry are noted by PM Wetherill in \"Literary Text: An Examination of Critical Methods\". The first is that there may be an over-preoccupation with one particular feature that may well minimise the significance of others that are equally important (Wetherill. 1974, 133). The second is that any attempt to see a text as simply a collection of stylistic elements will tend to ignore other ways whereby meaning is produced (Wetherill. 1974, 133).\n\nIn 'Poetic Effects' from \"Literary Pragmatics\", the linguist Adrian Pilkington analyses the idea of 'implicature', as instigated in the previous work of Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson. Implicature may be divided into two categories: 'strong' and 'weak' implicature, yet between the two extremes there are a variety of other alternatives. The strongest implicature is what is emphatically implied by the speaker or writer, while weaker implicatures are the wider possibilities of meaning that the hearer or reader may conclude.\n\nPilkington's 'poetic effects', as he terms the concept, are those that achieve most relevance through a wide array of weak implicatures and not those meanings that are simply 'read in' by the hearer or reader. Yet the distinguishing instant at which weak implicatures and the hearer or reader's conjecture of meaning diverge remains highly subjective. As Pilkington says: 'there is no clear cut-off point between assumptions which the speaker certainly endorses and assumptions derived purely on the hearer's responsibility.' (Pilkington. 1991, 53) In addition, the stylistic qualities of poetry can be seen as an accompaniment to Pilkington's poetic effects in understanding a poem's meaning.\n\nWiddowson points out that in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" (1798), the mystery of the Mariner's abrupt appearance is sustained by an idiosyncratic use of tense. (Widdowson. 1992, 40) For instance, the Mariner 'holds' the wedding-guest with his 'skinny hand' in the present tense, but releases it in the past tense ('...his hands dropt he.'); only to hold him again, this time with his 'glittering eye', in the present (Widdowson. 1992, 41).\n\nWiddowson notices that when the content of poetry is summarised, it often refers to very general and unimpressive observations, such as 'nature is beautiful; love is great; life is lonely; time passes', and so on (Widdowson. 1992, 9). But to say:<br>\nOr, indeed:<br>\nThis language gives the reader a new perspective on familiar themes and allows us to look at them without the personal or social conditioning that we unconsciously associate with them (Widdowson. 1992, 9). So, although the reader may still use the same exhausted words and vague terms like 'love', 'heart' and 'soul' to refer to human experience, to place these words in a new and refreshing context allows the poet the ability to represent humanity and communicate honestly. This, in part, is stylistics, and this, according to Widdowson, is the point of poetry (Widdowson. 1992, 76).\n\n\n\n"}

It deals with the philosophy of science. He published a sequel, \"And Not Antirealism Either\" in the same year, and both papers were later anthologized in the book \"The Shaky Game\" (1986).\n\nFine published \"The Natural Ontological Attitude\" in 1984 and a sequel, \"And Not Antirealism Either\" in the same year. His subject is the nature and validity of scientific knowledge and his goal is to get the reader to abandon either realism or antirealism as he understands them. In their place he advocates a \"natural ontological attitude\" (NOA). Both articles were republished as chapters in Fine's book \"The Shaky Game,\" which takes its title from a comment by Einstein that physicists who undermine causality in physics are playing a shaky/risky game.\n\nFine argues that both realists and anti-realists share a basic \"core\" position about both everyday things and scientific statements. Realists and antirealists both trust the evidence of their senses that tables, chairs and other people are present before us and in some sense exist. They also trust the substantiated pronouncements of science that protons and electrons exist and have the size, mass and charge science assigns them. To quote Fine about such common (\"core\") positions: \"…it is possible to accept the evidence of one's senses and accept, \"in the same way\" [his italics], the confirmed results of science….\". Stated another way: \"…both realist and antirealist accept the results of scientific investigations as 'true,' on par with more homely [commonplace, everyday] truths.\"\n\nFine asks, if everybody, realist and antirealist included, shares a core position about entities that exist and propositions that are true (e.g., F = ma) where do the differences lie? They lie, according to Fine, in the additions that partisans make to the core. Antirealists may add \"the pragmatic…[or] instrumentalist…[or] conventionalist conceptions of truth…[or maybe add an overlay of] idealism, constructivism, phenomenalism [or] empiricism.\" Spelling out what realists add to the core position takes Fine a long paragraph that boils down to simply one charge: \"correspondence with the world … claims about reality.\"\n\nFine then goes on. \"It seems to me that when we contrast the realist and the antirealist in terms of what they each want to add to the core position, a third alternative emerges—and an attractive one at that. It is the core position itself, \"and all by itself\" [his italics].\" Fine continues, \"…at heart, the grip of realism only extends to the homely connection of everyday truths with scientific truths, and that good sense dictates our acceptance of the one on the same basis as our acceptance of the other, then the homely line makes the core position, all by itself, a compelling one...\"\n\nRealism itself is unpalatable to Fine because of the realist's desire to connect truths about an entity (say the mass or charge of an electron) to an actual, existing entity (electron). It is permissible to believe in the properties of an electron but not in the electron itself as the bearer of those properties. That is the mistake realists make. Yet Fine admits that the working scientist believes \"…in the existence of those entities to which his theories refer.\" In addition, Fine concedes that practitioners of science are in no need of the goals, interpretations or justifications of science that theorists can provide. And although scientists may discover more and more properties of, or facts about, an entity, Fine insists that we should not confuse successive advances in our knowledge of an entity with closer approximations as to what that entity actually is.\n\nAntirealists also come under criticism. Theorists who define truth in terms of \"acceptance\" (rational agreement), or behaviorism or empiricism are all \"truthmongers\" who are seeking some foundation, some rationale, for what they believe. They make the same basic mistake as the realists since they \"rely on metaphysical or epistemological hearing aids\" to hear the voice of science. Only NOA is immune from these delusions and distractions. Fine concludes \"And Not Antirealism Either\" by arguing that truth is a semantical concept and not an ontological or metaphysical concept. He argues that those who wish to ground \"truth\" in correspondence, empiricism, pragmatism, acceptance, etc. are all making the same fundamental mistake. Embrace NOA he argues and be non-judgmental and heuristic in your pursuit of knowledge. Reject the concept of \"truth\" as a gold standard to which all knowledge must be compared or evaluated.\n\nSince Fine criticizes both realists and antirealists he has come in for criticism from both sides. Many critics could not resist some word play with NOA/NOAH, ark, and \"Fine.\"\n\nAlan Musgrave argues that Fine distorts the varied positions of antirealists especially with regard to their support of the \"core.\" He and others object to the way Fine equates his \"core\" position with their definition (or anti-definition) of \"true.\"\n\nRobert Klee writes: \"NOA seems like obvious inconsistent fence-sitting.\"\n\nRichard Schlagel writes \"I find it utterly implausible that Fine could be serious when he argues that explanatory success could have nothing at all to do with truth.\"\n\nStathis Psillos writes \"When is the question of theory-acceptance scientifically relevant, and when is it not? Fine refrains from saying, perhaps, because, in the final analysis, it always is relevant.\"\n\n"}

It depicts an Ancient Roman slave auction. It shows the marketing of seven young people, ranging in age from children to young adults, as slaves. Both male slaves, as well as three of the female slaves, bear a similarity in appearance perhaps suggesting that they are members of a family forced into slavery by economic conditions. All are wearing tags to indicate their availability as slaves. The youngest boy is completely naked, while the young man next to him is wearing a loincloth. The young woman sitting next to them is topless, wearing only a skirt, but she is covering her breasts with her legs. The standing African woman is also topless, wearing a white loincloth, and she is covering her breasts with her hands. The taller, standing, young woman is wearing a translucent garment which clearly shows her breasts and pubic hair—she is trying to shield her eyes, perhaps because her potential buyers include former friends and neighbors, who are probably seeing her nude for the first time. The adolescent girl next to her is also topless and barefoot, wearing a skirt. The young woman sitting next to them is wearing a loose garment which leaves both her breasts and her genitals exposed. The auctioneer eats his lunch with a very casual attitude.\n\nFrom a common type of Salon academic art of the period, it depicts an eroticized scene clad as a history painting, as was customary at the time in Paris.

{"id": "2545941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2545941", "title": "Transrealism (literature)", "text": "Transrealism (literature)\n\nTransrealism is a literary mode that mixes the techniques of incorporating fantastic elements used in science fiction with the techniques of describing immediate perceptions from naturalistic realism. While combining the strengths of the two approaches, it is largely a reaction to their perceived weaknesses. Transrealism addresses the escapism and disconnect with reality of science fiction by providing for superior characterization through autobiographical features and simulation of the author's acquaintances. It addresses the tiredness and boundaries of realism by using fantastic elements to create new metaphors for psychological change and to incorporate the author's perception of a higher reality in which life is embedded. One possible source for this higher reality is the increasingly strange models of the universe put forward in theoretical astrophysics.\n\nIts main proponent and prominent figure is science fiction author Rudy Rucker. Rucker coined the term \"transrealism\" after reading Philip K Dick's \"A Scanner Darkly\" described as \"transcendental autobiography,\" and expounded the principles of transrealism in a short essay titled \"A Transrealist Manifesto\" in 1983. Rucker applied many of these principles in his short stories and novels, notably \"White Light\" and \"Saucer Wisdom\". Damien Broderick has identified some other authors that have at some time utilized transrealist tropes to include Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Iain Banks, John Barth, J.G. Ballard, John Calvin Batchelor, Jonathan Carroll, Philip K. Dick especially, Karen Joy Fowler, Lisa Goldstein, James Morrow, Thomas Pynchon, Joanna Russ and James Tiptree Jr.\n\nDamien Broderick argues that a state of perception (termed \"transreality\") that is playfully contrary to consensus reality is a prerequisite for writing effective transrealist fiction. The necessary viewpoint is playful in the sense that the author does not need to literally believe the fantastic interpretation of the perception and may support and undermine it through reference to speculative science. An example of this can be seen in Rucker's blog, where he discusses an experience in an airport terminal. In a 2014 essay, Damien Walter argued that science fiction and other literature were increasingly converging, and that the refusal of plot and \"archetypal\" characters in transrealism is \"meant to be uncomfortable, by telling us that our reality is at best constructed, at worst non-existent\".\n\nTransrealism's stance against consensus reality identifies it as a postmodern literature akin to surrealism and covering much the same ground as slipstream literature. Transrealism may be considered a subset of slipstream, depending on how the latter term is defined, or as Broderick posits, slipstream may be very nearly the same thing as transrealism. Broderick also argues that the approach to literature offered by science fiction as a whole, including both transrealism and slipstream, becomes more crucial as society possibly approaches a technological singularity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44373", "title": "Triton (mythology)", "text": "Triton (mythology)\n\nTriton (; \"Tritōn\") is a mythological Greek god, the messenger of the sea. He is the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite, god and goddess of the sea respectively, and is herald for his father. He is usually represented as a merman which has the upper body of a human and the tail, soft dorsal fin, spiny dorsal fin, anal fin, pelvic fins and caudal fin of a fish, \"sea-hued\", according to Ovid \"his shoulders barnacled with sea-shells\".\n\nLike his father, Poseidon, he carried a trident. However, Triton's special attribute was a twisted conch shell, on which he blew like a trumpet to calm or raise the waves. Its sound was such a cacophony, that when loudly blown, it put the giants to flight, who imagined it to be the roar of a dark wild beast.\n\nAccording to Hesiod's \"Theogony\", Triton dwelt with his parents in a golden palace in the depths of the sea; Homer places his seat in the waters off Aegae (presumably Aegae, Achaea, where Poseidon had his palace). The story of the Argonauts places his home on the coast of Libya. When the Argo was driven ashore in the Gulf of Syrtes Minor, the crew carried the vessel to the \"Tritonian Lake\", Lake Tritonis, whence Triton, the local deity euhemeristically rationalized by Diodorus Siculus as \"then ruler over Libya\", welcomed them with a guest-gift of a clod of earth and guided them through the lake's marshy outlet back to the Mediterranean. When the Argonauts were lost in the desert, he guided them to find the passage from the river back to the sea.\n\nTriton was the father of Pallas and foster parent to the goddess Athena. Pallas was killed by Athena accidentally during a sparring fight between the two goddesses. Triton can sometimes be multiplied into a host of Tritones, \"daimones\" of the sea.\n\nIn Virgil's \"Aeneid\", book 6, it is told that Triton killed Misenus, son of Aeolus, by drowning him after he challenged the gods to play as well as he did.\n\nOver time, Triton's class and image came to be associated with a class of mermaid-like creatures, the Tritons (Τρίτωνες), which could be male or female, and usually formed the escort of marine divinities. Tritons were a race of sea gods and goddesses born from Triton. Triton lived with his parents, Poseidon and Amphitrite, who was also known as Celaeno, in a golden palace on the bottom of the sea. According to Homer it was called Aegae. Unlike their ancestor Poseidon who is always fully anthropomorphic in ancient art (this has only changed in modern popular culture), Triton's lower half is that of a fish, while the top half is presented in a human figure. This is debated often because their appearance is described differently throughout history. Ordinary Tritons were described in detail by the traveller Pausanias (ix. 21).\n\nThey are often compared to other Merman/Mermaid like beings, such as Merrows, Selkies, and Sirens. They are also thought of as the aquatic versions of Satyrs. Another description of Tritons is that of the Centaur-Tritons, also known as Ichthyocentaurs who are depicted with two horse's feet in place of arms.\n\nWhen Pausanias visited the city of Triteia in the second century CE, he was told that the name of the city was derived from an eponymous Triteia, a daughter of Triton, and that it claimed to have been founded by her son (with Ares), one among several mythic heroes named Melanippus (\"Black Horse\").\n\nTritons were the trumpeters of the sea, using trumpets made out of a great shell, mostly known as a conch. They would blow this shell throughout the sea to calm the waves, or stir them up, all at the command of Poseidon.\n\nThere are numerous universities, colleges, and high schools that use Triton as their mascot. These include the following:\nMany club sports teams, such as junior football leagues and numerous swimming leagues, also use the symbol of Triton.\n\nAn example of other uses include Wilfrid Laurier University's orientation week in 2014 that had a colour team named the Green Tritons as part of the weeks events.\n\nThe largest moon of the planet Neptune has been given the name Triton, as Neptune is the Roman equivalent of Poseidon.\n\nIn Wordsworth's sonnet \"The World Is Too Much with Us\" (ca 1802, published 1807), the poet regrets the prosaic humdrum modern world, yearning for\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em\">glimpses that would make me less forlorn;\nHave sight of Proteus rising from the sea;\nOr hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.</poem>\n\nIn Jacob Jordaens' 'The Family of the Artist', now in the Prado, Madrid, a Triton is depicted gripping, perhaps crushing, a child with its snake-like tail, a scene watched over by an exotic parrot. The significance of this motif in the context of a painting of domestic happiness is unclear, but it may involve a transfer of functions in that the child appears to be blowing on the conch shell (referred to above) in order to frighten away those forces that threaten family peace.\n\nA family of large sea snails, the shells of some of which have been used as trumpets since antiquity, are commonly known as \"tritons\", see Triton (gastropod).\n\nThe name Triton is associated in modern industry with tough hard-wearing machines such as the Ford Triton engine and Mitsubishi Triton pickup truck.\n\nKing Triton is a character depicted in the Disney's \"The Little Mermaid\", inspired by Triton, as an undersea king, the father of the title character. In \"The Little Mermaid\", Triton has seven daughters for the Seven Seas, the youngest named Ariel, of whom he is very overprotective. Though, this character (and all the other ones in the Disney movie) are actually based in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale.\n\n"}
{"id": "21754381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21754381", "title": "Turkmen rug", "text": "Turkmen rug\n\nA Turkmen rug (; or Turkmen carpet or Turkoman carpet) is a type of handmade floor-covering textile traditionally originating in Central Asia. It is useful to distinguish between the original Turkmen tribal rugs and the rugs produced in large numbers for export mainly in Pakistan and Iran today. The original Turkmen rugs were produced by the Turkmen tribes who are the main ethnic group in Turkmenistan and are also found in Afghanistan and Iran. They are used for various purposes, including tent rugs, door hangings and bags of various sizes.\n\nA few centuries back, almost all Turkmen rugs were produced by nomadic tribes almost entirely with locally obtained materials, wool from the herds and vegetable dyes, or other natural dyes from the land. They used geometrical designs that varied from tribe to tribe; most famous are the Yomut, Ersari, Saryk, Salor, and Tekke. Irregularities — considered part of the charm by many rug collectors — were fairly common since natural materials varied from batch to batch and woolen warp or weft may stretch, especially on a loom that is regularly folded up for transport and set up a new at another camp.\n\nMore recently, large rug workshops in the cities have appeared, there are fewer irregularities, and the technology has changed some. Since about 1910, synthetic dyes have been used along with natural ones. The size of nomadic rugs is limited to what can be done on a nomad's portable loom; larger rugs have always been produced in the villages, but they are now more common. Using cotton for warp and weft threads has also become common.\n\nThe rugs produced in large numbers for export in Pakistan and Iran and sold under the name of Turkmen rugs are mostly made of synthetic colors, with cotton warps and wefts and wool pile. They have little in common with the original Turkmen tribal rugs. In these export rugs, various patterns and colors are used, but the most typical is that of the Bukhara design, which derives from the Tekke main carpet, often with a red or tan background (picture). Another favorite is derived from the Ersari main carpet, with the octagonal \"elephant's foot\" design. The Turkmen Carpet Museum, which preserves examples of the original Turkmen tribal rugs, is located in Ashgabat.\n\nMany Afghan rugs bear a strong resemblance to Turkmen rugs.

However, there are also some very fine Afghans including many using Turkmen designs.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century, carpet weaving in Turkmenistan had become one of the most important sectors of the economy. In 1992, Turkmen Carpet Day officially became a public national holiday, celebrated annually on the last Sunday in May. Among the modern Turkmen carpets stands the world's largest handmade carpet total area of 301 m, which was woven in 2001, and in 2003 entered in the \"Guinness Book of Records\".\n\nThe vertical strip of the Flag of Turkmenistan placed five main patterns of Turkmen carpets. These figures are arranged. Secondary figures are disposed along the edges. Patterns reflect national unity of Turkmenistan. The five traditional carpet motifs in Emblem of Turkmenistan on the red disc represent the five major tribes or houses, and stand for the traditional and religious values of the country. These Turkmen tribes in traditional order are Teke, Yomut, Arsary, Chowdur and Saryk (Saryq).\n\nState Association Turkmenhaly is a major supplier to the world market of pure wool pile hand-made Turkmen carpets from Turkmenistan. The principal activities of the corporation are the production and sale of Turkmen carpets and rugs, preserving the traditions of carpet weaving hand, the restoration of old carpet ornaments and articles.\n\nThe Turkmenistan Presidential Decree of 20 March 1993 in Ashgabat created the Turkmen Carpet Museum. The Carpet Museum is one of the cultural centers of Turkmenistan, which has about 2,000 carpet exhibits, including rare ones, on display. For example, the museum has the smallest carpet product, designed to be worn with keys. The museum conducts restoration of antique carpets as well. It's a challenging process - some artfully woven old specimens contain up to 1,350,000 knots. The museum is constantly updated, and its employees conduct searches and compiles collections of old carpets. The new building of the National Museum of Turkmen Carpets has an overall space of 5089 m. The museum also hosts international scientific forums and conferences.\n\nBereket has a Turkmen carpet weaving factory, in usage since 1923.\n\n\n"}
