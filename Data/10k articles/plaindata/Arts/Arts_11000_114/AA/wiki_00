It is set around 1820 in Ioannina, then part of the Ottoman Empire and is named after its central character Ali Pasha of Ioannina.\n\nIts music and libretto are both by the German composer Albert Lortzing – it can be considered as a precursor to his later full-length operas. He had decided to write for the stage in 1823, aged 22. Orientalist subjects were then popular and so he chose that theme for his first work. On 30 January 1824 he married Rosina Regina Ahles and soon afterwards he completed the music, but it took him until 1828 to find a theatre which would mount the work.\n\nThe couple took on an engagement at the Hoftheater Detmold in autumn 1826, as well as appearing in theatres in Münster and Osnabrück. Lortzing finally premiered the work in the Städtische Bühnen Münster in on 1 February 1828, where it was a moderate success and enabled him to continue writing plays.\n\n\nStationed in Ioannina with his battalion, the French naval captain Bernier has fallen in love with Arianna, a beautiful girl from the nearby island of Corfu. However, he has not heard from her for days and is worried about what might have happened to her. Bernier's friend Robert tries in vain to comfort him.\n\nBernier's concerns prove justified – Arianna had been captured by a wild horde whilst out walking on the beach and taken to Ali Pasha's harem. Ali Pasha cannot bear her laments and complaints and orders her to forget Bernier since she now belongs to him alone. The other women in the harem are unwilling to raise Arianna's hopes and instead advise her that the only way to survive her suffering is to submit herself to fate and Ali Pasha's will.\n\nIn the meantime Bernier receives news of his beloved and gains entry to Ali Pasha's palace under a pretext. Ali Pasha is initially delighted to welcome a Frenchman and brings in Arianna to show her off to him, make Bernier envious and draw on Bernier's knowledge of women.\n\nBernier and Arianna find it hard to conceal their true feelings and pretend that they do not know each other, but only a few minutes after Ali Pasha leaves she admits to her love. Ali Pasha overhears this from a hiding place and rushes back in swearing vengeance. Bernier is chained up but Robert and the French battalion succeed in penetrating the harem. They free Bernier and Arianna and return with them to France.\n\n"}

Several cover versions have since been made, including a major 1983 hit for George Strait.\n\nMembers of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.\n\nStafford conceived the song after playing with his band at a rodeo in San Antonio, Texas, and then driving back to his home in Amarillo, Texas.\n\nStafford recorded the song on his \"Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose\" album, released in 1973. The single was released August 2, 1973, by Atlantic Records with the master number 26867. The single \"Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose\" had been previously released as an A-side 45 (Atlantic Master 26868; June 7, 1973), but due to the success of \"Amarillo by Morning\", the single was re-released October 4, 1973, as the A-side (Atlantic Master 26867-1 stereo and Atlantic Master 26867-2 mono), with \"Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose\" on the B-side. The song entered the Cash Box Country Looking Ahead chart November 3, 1973, the Cash Box Country chart on December 15, 1973, peaking at #37, the Billboard Country chart December 1, 1973, peaking at #31, the Record World Country chart December 15, 1973, peaking at #50, and Canada RPM Country chart January 26, 1974, peaking at number 38.\n\nThe song has been covered by numerous artists, including rodeo champion Chris LeDoux in 1975 on his album \"Life as a Rodeo Man\", Asleep at the Wheel and John Arthur Martinez on his 2004 album \"Lone Starry Night\".\n\nSouth Texas recording artist Clifton Jansky from San Antonio recorded the song in November 1979 in Ludwig Studios in Houston, Texas. He had a regional hit in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Louisiana. Three years later, he exchanged soundtracks with Kelly Schoppa in Houston. He traded his soundtrack to \"Amarillo by Morning\" for a duet that Kelly had recorded in Nashville with Janie Fricke and no money changed hands. George Strait heard Kelly's version in 1982 and decided to record Amarillo by Morning in 1983. It has become George Strait's signature song since then.\n\nCanadian indie rock artist Fancey covered the song on his 2018 album of 1960s and 70s country songs \"County Fair\". Brazilian singer Zé Ramalho has also recorded the song.\n\nIt was covered in 1983 by George Strait. It appeared on Strait's 1982 album \"Strait from the Heart\" (LP MCA 5320). It was released on MCA as a single, release number 52162. The publisher's release was January 14, 1983, and the full release came February 16, 1983. The single entered the Billboard Country chart February 12, 1983, peaking at #4.\n\nKevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A grade, saying that he has \"finally found his niche as a performer.\" He goes on to say that the \"simple arrangement and understated delivery are the defining elements of just about every Strait record since.\"\n\nThe song is regularly played at rodeos. The song was named \"#12 country song of all-time\" by Country Music Television. Development Counsellors International and \"USA Today\" named the song one of the top ten songs about a place, number 7.\n"}

{"id": "28869128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28869128", "title": "Bell Savage Inn", "text": "Bell Savage Inn\n\nThe Bell Savage Inn was a former public house in London, England, from the 15th century to 1873, originally located on the north side of what is now Ludgate Hill, in the City of London. It was a playhouse during the Elizabethan Era, as well as a venue for various other entertainments. It was also an important coaching inn. Other names by which it has been known throughout history include: Savage's Inn, The Bel Savage, Belle Savage, Belle Sauvage, Bell on the Hoop, Old Bell Savage, Belly Savage and others.\n\nWritten records allow the Inn's history to be traced back to at least 1420. In 1453 (in the reign of Henry VI), a deed gave the building's name (in translation) as \"\"Savage's Inn\" or \"The Bell on the Hoop\"\" and located within the parish of St. Bridget (Bride) in Fleet Street. \"Savage\" is thought to be the name of a former, perhaps the original, proprietor; a William Savage, who was recorded as having resided in Fleet Street in 1380, has been suggested as a possibility, which, would date the inn back to at least some time in the 14th century.\n\nThe alternative name \"Bell on the Hoop\" may be explained by the fact that both symbols have commonly been used on English Inn signs of the period – the \"hoop\" refers to a garland of Ivy. The later name, \"Bell Savage\", could have arisen as a linguistic inversion of \"Savage's Bell\". Also in the past it was rumored to be derived from the French phrase \"belle sauvage\", but Hensleigh Wedgwood considered that interpretation with scepticism.\n\nIn 1554, it is recorded that Sir Thomas Wyatt, leader of a popular revolt against Queen Mary, and his men, \"came to Bell Savage, an Inn nigh unto Lud gate\", but the gate was closed to prevent the rebels entering the City of London. Hence Wyatt \"rested him awhile upon a stall over against the Bell Savage gate\". Shortly afterwards he surrendered at Temple Bar.\n\nIn 1568, the Inn was bequeathed to the Cutlers' Company, an old City trade guild, for the purpose of exhibitions at Oxford and Cambridge and the benefit of the poor of the parish of St. Bride's. At this time the property consisted of 2 courts: The entrance to the outer court was via an archway leading from the north side of Ludgate Hill; the entrance to the inner court was through another archway directly opposite the first. The Inn itself was the building surrounding the inner court, which was overlooked by 2 tiers of covered balconies, from which the guest rooms were accessed.\nThe Bell Savage was one of the four inns of London that were used as playhouse in the late 16th century – in this case from 1575. The balconies surrounding the inner court served as the upper and lower circles, the rooms of the Inn became private \"boxes\" and the yard itself was the \"pit\". The stage would have been built against one side of the yard and curtained off. Richard Tarlton, the well-known comedian, performed here. The inner courtyard of the Inn was also used for public displays of fencing from the mid-1560s to 1589, and as these displays took place on a stage it is quite possible that dramas could also have been enacted at this earlier period. The showman William Bankes and his trick horse \"Marocco\" performed here. Bear-baiting also took place in the latter half of the 16th century.\n\nIn 1616, Pocahontas and her retinue, who had come over from Virginia, were boarded at the Bell Savage. The yard at this time was said to be the \"haunt of thieves and conmen...noisy, dangerous and evil-smelling\". In the Great Fire of 1666 the Inn was burnt to the ground, but rebuilt afterwards some time prior to 1676. In the outer court were some private houses; Grinling Gibbons lived here for a period before 1677, and the quack Richard Rock also resided here. In 1684, the inn was advertising a \"Rhynoceros, lately brought from the East Indies\" which could be seen by the public for a small fee – the first rhinoceros to be exhibited in England. Among the people to view it was Francis North, 1st Baron Guilford, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal.\nThe Bell Savage was an important coaching inn from at least the reign of Charles II, and probably long before; a newspaper advertisement in 1674 states that the Inn had 40 rooms for guests and stabling for 100 horses.\n\nThe Inn declined with the growth of the railways and by the mid 19th century, parts had become very dilapidated. During the Great Exhibition of 1851, a John Thorburn, took out a lease on part or all of the property and refurbished the accommodation for paying guests. In 1852, John Cassell's publishing house and printing works moved into part of the premises. This adversely affected the hotel business as the noise and vibration from the presses disturbed guests. In 1853, Cassell took over the rest of the property from Thorburn – to the latter's relief.\n\nDuring Cassell's tenure, the yard was progressively rebuilt; the Inn was finally demolished in 1873 to make way for a railway viaduct. No visible trace now remains. The Cassell & Company's building was called La Belle Sauvage prior to 1914.\n\nThe Bell Savage featured in Dickens's \"Pickwick Papers\" and in Sir Walter Scott's Kenilworth. Amongst artists who drew or painted the inn were: Robert Laurie (1755–1836), Thomas Hosmer Shepherd, George Shepherd, John Maggs (1819–1896), and Charles Jameson Grant (fl. 1831–1846).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4861812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4861812", "title": "Bernard Natan", "text": "Bernard Natan\n\nBernard Natan (born Natan Tannenzaft; July 14, 1886 – October 1942) was a Franco-Romanian film entrepreneur, director and actor of the 1920s and 1930s. He was once said by historians to be one of the earliest (if not the earliest) pornographic film directors and porn stars, although there is now considerable doubt about this. Natan certainly worked in mainstream cinema from his youngest days, working his way up from projectionist and chemist to cinematographer and producer. He eventually acquired the giant French motion picture studio Pathé in 1929. Pathé collapsed in 1935, and Natan was convicted of fraud. However, he laid the foundation for the modern film industry in France and helped revolutionize film technology around the world.\n\nNatan worked as a projectionist, film lab chemist, titles designer, cinematographer and producer during his early years in Paris. He was as a publicity stringer for Paramount Pictures during the early 1920s. But by 1929, Natan's Rapid Film had become a major film producer and distributor. His reputation was such that in 1924 Natan became a member of the executive committee of the Cinematographic Employers' Federation. By 1926, his film laboratory was highly regarded, he had established a marketing firm, and he built two sound stages. Natan was also a film producer, helping finance and produce motion pictures at other studios. \n\nIn late February 1929, Bernard Natan acquired the production and exhibition businesses of Pathé, then the largest French motion picture company. He agreed to merge his own studio, Rapid Film (then worth 25 million francs), with Pathé in exchange for 50 million francs in shares. The remaining shares were purchased with funding from a consortium of banks, bonds (to be paid with income from Pathé), and a 10 percent ownership in Pathé by the banks. After the merger, Natan renamed the company Pathé-Natan (sometimes also credited as Pathé-Cinéma).\n\nPathé was already in substantial financial trouble when Natan took control. Studio founder Charles Pathé had been selling assets for several years to boost investor value and keep the studio's cash flow healthy. The company's founder had even sold Pathé's name and \"rooster\" trademark to other companies in return for a mere 2 percent of revenues generated by them. Natan had the bad luck to take charge of the studio just as the Great Depression convulsed the French economy.\n\nNatan attempted to steady Pathé's finances and implement modern film industry practices at the studio. Natan acquired another film studio, Société des Cinéromans, from Arthur Bernède and Gaston Leroux, which enabled Pathé to expand into projector and electronics manufacturing. He also bought the Fornier chain of motion picture theaters and rapidly expanded the chain's nationwide presence. The French press, however, attacked Natan mercilessly for his stewardship of Pathé. Many of these attacks were antisemitic and contained veiled homophobic allusions to Natan's supposed sexuality.\n\nPathé-Natan did well under Natan's guidance. Between 1930 and 1935, despite the world economic crisis, the company made 100 million francs in profits, and produced and released more than 60 feature films (just as many films as major American studios produced at the time). He resumed production of the newsreel Pathé News, which had not been produced since 1927.\n\nNatan also invested heavily into research and development to expand Pathe's film business. In 1929, he pushed Pathé into sound film. In September, the studio produced its first sound feature film, and its first sound newsreel a month later. Natan also launched two new cinema-related magazines, \"Pathé-Revue\" and \"Actualités Féminines\", to help market Pathé's films and build consumer demand for cinema. Under Natan, Pathé also funded the research of Henri Chrétien, who developed the anamorphic lens (a technology which later led to the creation of CinemaScope and other widescreen film formats common today).\n\nNatan expanded Pathé's business interests into communications industries other than film. In November 1929, Natan established France's first television company, Télévision-Baird-Natan. A year later, he purchased a radio station in Paris and formed a holding company (Radio-Natan-Vitus) to run what would become a burgeoning radio empire.\n\nIn 1935, Pathé went bankrupt. In order to finance the company's continued expansion, Pathé's board of directors (which still included Charles Pathé) voted in 1930 to issue shares worth 105 million francs. But with the depression deepening, only 50 percent of the shares were purchased. One of the investor banks collapsed due to financial difficulties unrelated to Pathé's problems, and Pathé was forced to follow through with the purchase of several movie theater chains it no longer could afford to buy. Although the company continued to make a profit (as noted above) for a time, it soon began to lose more money than it could bring in.\n\nThe collapse of Pathé led French authorities to indict Bernard Natan on charges of fraud. Natan was accused of financing the purchase of the company without any collateral, of bilking investors by establishing fictitious shell corporations, and negligent financial mismanagement. Natan was even accused of hiding his Romanian and Jewish heritage by changing his name. Natan was indicted and imprisoned in 1939. This meant he was in prison when France fell to the Nazis, while most other major Jewish filmmakers were able to flee the country or go into hiding. A second indictment was brought in 1941, and he was convicted shortly thereafter. His French citizenship was taken away, which required special legal manovres by the state, since he had been naturalized as a result of his WWI military servie and there was no existing legal means to render him stateless. He was transferred from prison in September 1942 to the camp at Drancy, and shortly afterwards deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\nIn 1911, Natan and colleagues were convicted of making erotic films, he was jailed for a short time and fined 1,000 francs but due to his exceptional record fighting in World War I this was later removed from his record.\n\nSome sources have claimed that Natan's career in pornography did not end there. Joseph Slade suggests that Natan may have directed at least one hardcore pornographic film in Romania and produced and acted in at least 20 hardcore heterosexual and bisexual films between 1920 and 1927. Slade wrote that nearly all French pornographic films from this period which include bisexual and homosexual content were produced by Natan. The same source states that Natan himself was bisexual, and engaged in intercourse in \"Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly\" (1920) and \"La Maîtresse du Capitaine de Meydeux\" (1924). Furthermore, Slade claimed that he introduced masochism into French pornographic film.\n\nSlade's claims are disputed by the historians of the French organization \"Les Indépendants du Premier Siècle\", who argue that the various actors in question are not Natan and that accusations at Natan's trial and in Paris-Match connecting him to the adult film industry were false. \"Natan\", a 2013 documentary film, compares stills from the adult films attributed to Natan with official headshots and shows that several pornographic actors have been mistaken for Natan but are not him. Joseph Slade now admits there is room for doubt over whether Natan worked in pornography at any time after 1910.\n\nWorld War II broke out while Natan was in prison awaiting trial, and Nazi Germany conquered France. After Natan's release from prison, the French government handed him over to the occupying German authorities. Natan was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp on September 25, 1942, where it is believed he died in 1943.\n\nBernard Natan's importance to the French film industry should not be underestimated. He pioneered the vertical integration of the French film industry, and adopted the \"American model\" of film-making and distribution. This model provides the underpinning of the French film industry even in the 21st century. Indeed, Pathé survived into the 1980s almost solely on revenues generated by the companies purchased and integration instituted by Bernard Natan.\n\nNatan also brought television to France, and established the first French radio holding and television companies.\n\nUnder Natan's leadership, the anamorphic film camera lens was developed. The anamorphic lens was not only a major advance in film technology, but helped Hollywood survive during the early years of television.\n\nUntil recently there was no public acknowledgement of Natan at La Fémis, the French national film school, which is housed in one of his former studios. A plaque commemorating his work, and his death in Auschwitz in 1942, was unveiled in December 2014.\n\n"}

{"id": "4388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4388", "title": "Book of Proverbs", "text": "Book of Proverbs\n\nThe Book of Proverbs (Hebrew: מִשְלֵי, \"Míshlê (Shlomoh)\", \"Proverbs (of Solomon)\") is the second book of the third section (called Writings) of the Hebrew Bible and a book of the Christian Old Testament. When translated into Greek and Latin, the title took on different forms: in the Greek Septuagint (LXX) it became Παροιμίαι \"Paroimiai\" (\"Proverbs\"); in the Latin Vulgate the title was \"Proverbia\", from which the English name is derived.\n\nProverbs is not merely an anthology but a \"collection of collections\" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium. It is an example of the Biblical wisdom tradition, and raises questions of values, moral behaviour, the meaning of human life, and right conduct. The repeated theme is that \"the fear of God (meaning submission to the will of God) is the beginning of wisdom.\" Wisdom is praised for her role in creation; God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos; and since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life.\n\nThe superscriptions divide the collections as follows:\n\n\"Proverbs\" translates to the Hebrew word \"mashal\", but \"mashal\" has a wider range of meaning than the short catchy sayings implied by the English word. Thus, while roughly half the book is made up of \"sayings\" of this type, the other half is made up of longer poetic units of various types. These include \"instructions\" formulated as advice from a teacher or parent addressed to a student or child, dramatic personifications of both Wisdom and Folly, and the \"words of the wise\" sayings, longer than the Solomonic \"sayings\" but shorter and more diverse than the \"instructions\".\n\nThe first section (chapters 1–9) consists of an initial invitation to young men to take up the course of wisdom, ten \"instructions\", and five poems on personified Woman Wisdom. Proverbs 10:1–22:16, with 375 sayings, consists of two parts, the first contrasting the wise man and the fool (or the righteous and the wicked), the second addressing wise and foolish speech. Chapters 25–29, attributed to editorial activity of \"the men of Hezekiah,\" contrasts the just and the wicked and broaches the topic of rich and poor. Chapter 30:1–4, the \"sayings of Agur\", introduces creation, divine power, and human ignorance.\n\nIt is impossible to offer precise dates for the sayings in Proverbs, a \"collection of collections\" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium. The phrase conventionally used for the title is taken from chapter 1:1, \"mishley shelomoh\", Proverbs of Solomon (the phrase is repeated at 10:1 and 25:1), is likely more concerned with labeling the material than ascribing authorship.\n\nThe book is an anthology made up of six discrete units. The first, chapters 1–9, was probably the last to be composed, in the Persian or Hellenistic periods. This section has parallels to prior cuneiform writings. The second, chapters 10–22:16, carries the superscription \"the proverbs of Solomon\", which may have encouraged its inclusion in the Hebrew canon. The third unit is headed \"bend your ear and hear the words of the wise\": a large part of it is a recasting of a second-millennium BCE Egyptian work, the Instruction of Amenemope, and may have reached the Hebrew author(s) through an Aramaic translation. Chapter 24:23 begins a new section and source with the declaration, \"these too are from the wise.\" The next section at chapter 25:1 has a superscription to the effect that the following proverbs were transcribed \"by the men of Hezekiah\", indicating at face value that they were collected in the reign of Hezekiah in the late 8th century BCE. Chapters 30 and 31 (the \"words of Agur,\" the \"words of Lemuel,\" and the description of the ideal woman) are a set of appendices, quite different in style and emphasis from the previous chapters.\n\nThe \"wisdom\" genre was widespread throughout the ancient Near East, and reading Proverbs alongside the examples recovered from Egypt and Mesopotamia reveals the common ground shared by international wisdom. The wisdom literature of Israel may have been developed in the family, the royal court, and houses of learning and instruction; nevertheless, the overwhelming impression is of instruction within the family in small villages.\n\nAlong with the other examples of the Biblical wisdom tradition – Job and Ecclesiastes and some other writings – Proverbs raises questions of values, moral behavior, the meaning of human life, and righteous conduct. The three retain an ongoing relevance for both religious and secular readers, Job and Ecclesiastes through the boldness of their dissent from received tradition, Proverbs in its worldliness and satiric shrewdness. Wisdom is as close as Biblical literature comes to Greek philosophy, of which it was a contemporary; it shares with the Greeks an inquiry into values and reflections on the human condition, although there is no discussion of ontology, epistemology, metaphysics, and the other abstract issues raised by the Greeks.\n\nProverbs was almost excluded from the Bible because of its contradictions (the result of the book's origins as not just an anthology but an anthology of anthologies). The reader is told, for example, both to \"not answer a fool according to his folly\", according to 26:4, and to \"answer a fool according to his folly\", as 26:5 advises. More pervasively, the recurring theme of the initial unit (chapters 1–9) is that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but the following units are much less theological, presenting wisdom as a transmissible human craft, until with 30:1–14, the \"words of Agur,\" we return once more to the idea that God alone possesses wisdom.\n\n\"The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom\" (Proverbs 9:10 – the phrase implies submission to God's will). Wisdom is praised for her role in creation (\"God by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens\" – Proverbs 3:19). God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos (\"When [God] established the heavens...when he drew a circle on then face of the Deeps...when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was beside him\" – Proverbs 8:27–31). Since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life. Wisdom, or the wise person, is compared and contrasted with foolishness or the fool, meaning one who is lacking in wisdom and uninterested in instruction, not one who is merely silly or playful (though see the words of Agur for a \"fool\" who has wisdom, and could be seen as playful).\n\nFor the most part Proverbs offers a simplistic view of life with few grey areas: life lived according to the rules brings reward, life in violation of them is certain to bring disaster. In contrast, Job and Ecclesiastes appear to be direct contradictions of the simplicities of Proverbs, each in its own way all but dismissing the assumptions of the \"wise\". Noteworthy also is the fact that the \"mighty acts of God\" (the Exodus, the giving of the Torah at Sinai, the Covenant between God and Israel, etc.) which make up Israel's history are completely or almost completely absent from Proverbs and the other Wisdom books: in contrast to the other books of the Hebrew bible, which appeal to divine revelation for their authority (\"Thus says the Lord!\"), wisdom appeals to human reason and observation.\n\nThe pre-Exilic (i.e. pre-586 BCE) Old Testament allowed no equals to YHWH in heaven, despite the continued existence of an assembly of subordinate servant-deities. The post-Exilic writers of the Wisdom tradition developed the idea that Wisdom existed before creation and was used by God to create the universe: \"Present from the beginning, Wisdom assumes the role of master builder while God establishes the heavens, restricts the chaotic waters, and shapes the mountains and fields.\" Borrowing ideas from Greek philosophers who held that reason bound the universe together, the Wisdom tradition taught that God's Wisdom, Word and Spirit were the ground of cosmic unity. Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and applied them to Jesus: the Epistle to the Colossians calls Jesus \"...image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation...\", while the Gospel of John identifies him with the creative word (\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\"). \n\nIn the 4th century, when Christianity was caught up in heresies and still developing the creeds which would define its beliefs, was used both to support and refute the claims of the Arians. The Arians, assuming that Christ could be equated with the \"Wisdom of God\" (), argued that the Son, like Wisdom, was \"created\" (Proverbs 8:22), and therefore subordinate to the Creator; their opponents, who argued that the relevant Hebrew word should be translated as \"begot\", won the debate, and the Nicene Creed declared that the Son was \"begotten, not made\", meaning that God and Christ were consubstantial.\n\n\n\n\nOnline translations of \"Book of Proverbs\":\n"}

Typically, this requires restitching or renewal of the glue which holds the pages in place.\n\nCollectors of antique books such as incunabula would often have them rebound. This might be done to improve their appearance by rebinding in a more fashionable colour or to assert ownership by having the book rebound in uniform covers which were stamped with an insignia such as a coat of arms. One prominent collector who had this done was Earl Spencer. For example, when he acquired a medieval psalter of 1457, which was bound in pigskin on wooden boards, he had it rebound in mauve velvet over cardboard. The Bodelian Library rebound additions to its collection for functional reasons — to indicate value and importance. The Bibliothèque nationale de France requested 6600 francs for bookbinding in the eighth year of the revolutionary calendar, \"those which come from our conquests in Germany and Italy, and while infinitely precious, they have arrived to us in a deplorable state\".\n\nThe four-volume copy of Audubon's \"Birds of America\" held in the Royal Collection was rebound in 2011 by conservators at Windsor Castle. The volumes are especially large and heavy, being printed on double elephant paper of about 50 by 28 inches, and weighing over 50 pounds. The plates, which were published loose, had been originally bound by the royal bookbinder, James Mackenzie, around 1840. That leather cover had perished and the tight sewing of the pages made viewing difficult as the pages might tear. The rebinding was done in nine stages:\n"}

Typical illustrations are in watercolour, but may also be in oils, ink or pencil, or a combination of these. The image may be life size or not, the scale is often shown, and may show the habit and habitat of the plant, the upper and reverse sides of leaves, and details of flowers, bud, seed and root system.\n\nBotanical illustration is sometimes used as a type for attribution of a botanical name to a taxon. The inability of botanists to conserve certain dried specimens, or restrictions on safe transport, have meant illustrations have been nominated as the type for some names. Many minute plants, which may only be viewed under a microscope, are often identified by an illustration to overcome the difficulties in using slide mounted specimens. The standards for this are by international agreement (Art 37.5 of the Vienna Code, 2006)...\nThe use of illustrations was frequently seen in the herbals, seed catalogues and popular works of natural history. The illustrations produced during the eighteenth and nineteenth century are regarded as both appealing and scientifically valid. The finer detail of the printing processes, greatly improving at this time, allowed artists such as Franz and Ferdinand Bauer to depict the minute aspects of the subject. The use of exploded details would further illustrate the description given in the accompanying text. These details allowed a non scientific audience to go some way in identifying the species, the widening interest in natural history and horticulture was an inducement to the production of many Floras and regular publications.\n\nMany books and publication continued to use the illustrators, even after printed matter began to incorporate photography. It would be many years before the colour printing would equal the illustrators plates. The accuracy and craft of the illustrators had developed in tandem with the botanists concerned, the work came to be accepted as important to the botanists and their institutions. The illustrated publication, Curtis's Botanical Magazine (1787), was to eventually appoint an official artist. The 230-year-old magazine, long associated with the Linnaean Society and Kew Gardens, is now primarily one of finer botanical illustration. A stream of the finest illustrators to appear in print have been featured in the magazine.\n\nThe contribution of botanical illustrators continues to be praised and sought, very fine examples continue to be produced. In the 1980s, Celia Rosser undertook to illustrate every \"Banksia\" species for the masterwork, \"The Banksias\". When another species was described after its publication, \"Banksia rosserae\", it was named to honour her mammoth accomplishment. Other illustrators, such as the profuse illustrator Matilda Smith, have been specifically honoured for this work. In 1972 the Smithsonian Institution hired its first botanical illustrator, Alice Tangerini.\n\nNotable botanical illustrators include:\n\n\nThe Linnaean Society of London awards the Jill Smythies Award for botanical illustration.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1030000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1030000", "title": "Chapbook", "text": "Chapbook\n\nA chapbook is a type of popular literature printed in early modern Europe. Produced cheaply, chapbooks were commonly small, paper-covered booklets, usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages. They were often illustrated with crude woodcuts, which sometimes bore no relation to the text. When illustrations were included in chapbooks, they were considered popular prints.\n\nThe tradition of chapbooks arose in the 16th century, as soon as printed books became affordable, and rose to its height during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many different kinds of ephemera and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as almanacs, children's literature, folk tales, ballads, nursery rhymes, pamphlets, poetry, and political and religious tracts.\n\nThe term \"chapbook\" for this type of literature was coined in the 19th century. The corresponding French and German terms are \"bibliothèque bleue\" (blue book) and \"Volksbuch\" (people's book), respectively. In Spain they were known as \"pliegos de cordel\" (Cordel sheets).\n\nThe term \"chapbook\" is also in use for present-day publications, commonly short, inexpensive booklets.\n\n\"Chapbook\" is first attested in English in 1824, and seems to derive from the word for the itinerant salesmen who would sell such books: \"chapman\". The first element of \"chapman\" comes in turn from Old English \"cēap\" ('barter, business, dealing').\n\nBroadside ballads were popular songs, sold for a penny or halfpenny in the streets of towns and villages around Britain between the 16th century and early 20th centuries. They preceded chapbooks, but had similar content, marketing and distribution systems. There are records from Cambridgeshire as early as in 1553 of a man offering a scurrilous ballad \"maistres mass\" at an alehouse, and a pedlar selling \"lytle books\" to people, including a patcher of old clothes in 1578. These sales are probably characteristic of the market for chapbooks.\n\nChapbooks gradually disappeared from the mid-19th century in the face of competition from cheap newspapers and, especially in Scotland, religious tract societies that regarded them as \"ungodly.\" Although the form originated in Britain, many were made in the U.S. during the same period.\n\nBecause of their flimsy nature such ephemera rarely survive as individual items. They were aimed at buyers without formal libraries, and, in an era when paper was expensive, were used for wrapping or baking. Paper has also always had hygienic uses; there are contemporary references to the use of chapbooks as \"bum fodder\". Many of the surviving chapbooks come from the collections of Samuel Pepys between 1661 and 1688 which are now held at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Anthony Wood also collected 65 chapbooks, (including 20 from before 1660), which are now at The Bodleian Library. There are also significant Scottish collections, such as those held by the University of Glasgow.\n\nModern collectors, such as Peter Opie, have chiefly a scholarly interest in the form.\n\nChapbooks were cheap, anonymous publications that were the usual reading material for lower-class people who could not afford books. Members of the upper classes occasionally owned chapbooks, perhaps bound in leather with a personal monogram. Printers typically tailored their texts for the popular market. Chapbooks were usually between four and twenty-four pages long, and produced on rough paper with crude, frequently recycled, woodcut illustrations. They sold in the millions.\n\nAfter 1696 English chapbook peddlers had to be licensed, and 2,500 of them were then authorized, 500 in London alone. In France, there were 3,500 licensed \"colporteurs\" by 1848, and they sold 40 million books annually.\n\nThe centre of chapbook and ballad production was London, and until the Great Fire of London the printers were based around London Bridge. However, a feature of chapbooks is the proliferation of provincial printers, especially in Scotland and Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nChapbooks were an important medium for the dissemination of popular culture to the common people, especially in rural areas. They were a medium of entertainment, information and (generally unreliable) history. In general, the content of chapbooks has been criticized, though, for their unsophisticated narratives which were heavily loaded with repetition and emphasized adventure through mostly anecdotal structures. However, they are nonetheless valued as a record of popular culture, preserving cultural artifacts that may not survive in any other form.\n\nChapbooks were priced for sales to workers, although their market was not limited to the working classes. Broadside ballads were sold for a halfpenny, or a few pence. Prices of chapbooks were from 2d. to 6d., when agricultural labourers wages were 12d. per day. The literacy rate in England in the 1640s was around 30 percent for males and rose to 60 percent in the mid-18th century (see Education in the Age of Enlightenment). Many working people were readers, if not writers, and pre-industrial working patterns provided periods during which they could read. Chapbooks were undoubtedly used for reading to family groups or groups in alehouses.\n\nThey even contributed to the development of literacy. The author and publisher Francis Kirkman wrote about how they fired his imagination and his love of books. There is other evidence of their use by autodidacts.\n\nNevertheless, the numbers printed are astonishing. In the 1660s as many as 400,000 almanacs were printed annually, enough for one family in three in England. One 17th-century publisher of chapbooks in London had in stock one book for every 15 families in the country. In the 1520s the Oxford bookseller, John Dorne, noted in his day-book selling up to 190 ballads a day at a halfpenny each. The probate inventory of the stock of Charles Tias, of \"The sign of the Three Bibles\" on London Bridge, in 1664 included books and printed sheets to make c.90,000 chapbooks (inc. 400 reams of paper) and 37,500 ballad sheets. Tias was not regarded as an outstanding figure in the trade. The inventory of Josiah Blare, of \"The Sign of the Looking Glass\" on London Bridge, in 1707 listed 31,000 books, plus 257 reams of printed sheets. A conservative estimate of their sales in Scotland alone in the second half of the 18th century was over 200,000 per year.\n\nThese printers provided chapbooks to chapmen on credit, who carried them around the country, selling from door to door, at markets and fairs, and returning to pay for the stock they sold. This facilitated wide distribution and large sales with minimum outlay, and also provided the printers with feedback about what titles were most popular. Popular works were reprinted, pirated, edited, and produced in different editions. Francis Kirkman, whose eye was always on the market, wrote two sequels to the popular \"Don Bellianus of Greece\", first printed in 1598.\n\nPublishers also issued catalogues, and chapbooks are found in the libraries of provincial yeomen and gentry. John Whiting, a Quaker yeoman imprisoned at Ilchester, Somerset, in the 1680s had books sent by carrier from London, and left for him at an inn.\n\nPepys had a collection of ballads bound into volumes, under the following classifications, into which could fit the subject matter of most chapbooks: \n\nThe stories in many of the popular chapbooks can be traced back to much earlier origins. \"Bevis of Hampton\" was an Anglo-Norman romance of the 13th century, which probably drew on earlier themes. The structure of \"The Seven Sages of Rome\" was from the orient, and was used by Chaucer. Many jests about ignorant and greedy clergy in chapbooks were taken from \"The Friar and the Boy\" printed about 1500 by Wynkyn de Worde, and \"The Sackfull of News\" (1557).\n\nHistorical stories set in a mythical and fantastical past were popular. The selection is interesting. Charles I, and Oliver Cromwell do not appear as historical figures in the Pepys collection, and Elizabeth I only once. The Wars of the Roses and the English Civil War do not appear at all. Henry VIII and Henry II appear in disguise, standing up for the right with cobblers and millers and then inviting them to Court and rewarding them. There was a pattern of high born heroes overcoming reduced circumstances by valour, such as St George, Guy of Warwick, Robin Hood (who at this stage has yet to give to the poor what he was stealing from the rich), and heroes of low birth who achieve status through force of arms, such as Clim of Clough, and William of Cloudesley. Clergy often appear as figures of fun, and stupid countrymen were also popular (e.g., \"The Wise Men of Gotham\"). Other works were aimed at regional and rural audience (e.g., \"The Country Mouse and the Town Mouse\").\n\nFrom 1597 works appeared aimed at specific trades, such as clothiers, weavers and shoemakers. The latter were commonly literate. Thomas Deloney, a weaver, wrote \"Thomas of Reading\", about six clothiers from Reading, Gloucester, Worcester, Exeter, Salisbury and Southampton, travelling together and meeting at Basingstoke their fellows from Kendal, Manchester and Halifax. In his, \"Jack of Newbury\", 1600, set in Henry VIII's time, an apprentice to a broadcloth weaver takes over his business and marries his widow on his death. On achieving success, he is liberal to the poor and refuses a knighthood for his substantial services to the king.\n\nOther examples from the Pepys collection include \"The Countryman's Counsellor, or Everyman his own Lawyer\", and \"Sports and Pastimes\", written for schoolboys, including magic tricks, like how to \"fetch a shilling out of a handkerchief\", write invisibly, make roses out of paper, snare wild duck, and make a maid-servant fart uncontrollably.\n\nThe provinces and Scotland had their own local heroes. Robert Burns commented that one of the first two books he read in private was \"the history of Sir William Wallace ... poured a Scottish prejudice in my veins which will boil along there till the flood-gates of life shut in eternal rest\".\n\nThey had a wide and continuing influence. Eighty percent of English folk songs collected by early-20th-century collectors have been linked to printed broadsides, including over 90 of which could only be derived from those printed before 1700. It has been suggested the majority of surviving ballads can be traced to 1550–1600 by internal evidence.\n\nOne of the most popular and influential chapbooks was Richard Johnson's \"Seven Champions of Christendom\" (1596), believed to be the source for the introduction of the character St George into English folk plays.\n\nRobert Greene's novel \"Dorastus and Fawnia\" (originally \"Pandosto\") (1588), the basis of Shakespeare's \"The Winter's Tale\", was still being published in cheap editions in the 1680s. Some stories were still being published in the 19th century, (e.g., \"Jack of Newbury\", \"Friar Bacon\", \"Dr Faustus\" and \"The Seven Champions of Christendom\").\n\n\"Chapbook\" is also a term currently used to denote publications of up to about 40 pages, usually poetry bound with some form of saddle stitch, though many are perfect bound, folded, or wrapped. These publications range from low-cost productions to finely produced, hand-made editions that may sell to collectors for hundreds of dollars. More recently, the popularity of fiction and nonfiction chapbooks has also increased. In the UK they are more often referred to as pamphlets.\n\nThe genre has been revitalized in the past 40 years by the widespread availability of first mimeograph technology, then low-cost copy centers and digital printing, and by the cultural revolutions spurred by both zines and poetry slams, the latter generating hundreds upon hundreds of self-published chapbooks that are used to fund tours. In New York, a joint effort of the Center for the Humanities at the Graduate Center, CUNY and their sponsors has come up with the NYC/CUNY Chapbook festival where, as it states in their about page, “The NYC/CUNY Chapbook Festival celebrates the chapbook as a work of art, and as a medium for alternative and emerging writers and publishers… the festival features a day-long bookfair with chapbook publishers from around the country, workshops, panels, a chapbook exhibition, and a reading of prize-winning Chapbook Fellows.”\n\nWith the recent popularity of blogs, online literary journals, and other online publishers, short collections of poetry published online are frequently referred to as \"online chapbooks\", \"electronic chapbooks\", \"e-chapbooks\", or \"e-chaps\".\n\nStephen King wrote a few parts of an early draft of \"The Plant\" and sent them out as chapbooks to his friends, instead of Christmas cards, in 1982, 1983, and 1985. Philtrum Press produced just three installments before the story was shelved, and the original editions have been hotly sought-after collector's items.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43392034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43392034", "title": "Circles (film distributor)", "text": "Circles (film distributor)\n\nCircles was a feminist film and video distribution network in the UK, which was set up out of a desire to distribute and screen women's films on their own terms. It was founded in 1979 by feminist filmmakers Lis Rhodes, Jo Davis, Felicity Sparrow and Annabel Nicolson, publishing a 1980 catalogue including about 30 films, and it closed in 1991, largely due to funding issues that also prompted the merger of Circles and Cinema of Women, which led to the formation of Cinenova. A previous funding crisis in 1987, when funding by Tower Hamlets council had been withdrawn, had been resolved with replacement funding from the British Film Institute.\n\nAccording to Jenny Holland and Jane Harris, \"Circles started in 1979, partly as a response to an Arts Council of Great Britain exhibition on experimental film. Feeling that their work on women's involvement in this field was being marginalised, the women on the exhibition committee withdrew their painstakingly researched work and issued an explanatory statement. In many ways, this research was the cornerstone of Circles, which went on to distribute the films by Alice Guy, Germaine Dulac, Maya Deren, and Lois Weber which were to have been discussed in the exhibition.\" The statement, \"Women and the Formal Film,\" was published in the \"Film as Film\" exhibition catalogue and acted as a manifesto for the distribution collective that emerged.\n\nBy the time of its closure, Circles' catalogue comprised over 200 titles, predominantly short and medium-length films, encompasses 90 years of women's film production and including a range of original formats, \"offering tape recording, video tapes, slide/tape and performance works for hire alongside film.\" The catalogue editors described the films and their significance as: representing the visions, truths and ideas of women from a diverse range of cultural and political backgrounds. Each film/video breaks the monopoly of the male-defined culture, placing women at the centre of the images, the stories and the language; replacing male subjectivity with women's experiences as female eyes look through the camera.… These films and videos represent the voices of women who have been systematically silenced and abused, by a mainstream media and cinema, whose interest in ideas and people are based on commercial concerns of profit and the desire to maintain women as spectators. Women in refusing to be confined to this role have produced films and videos, often with low budgets or none at all; often under difficult personal circumstances, yet independently without the pressure to either compromise politically or aesthetically. Despite narrow ideas of content, form and 'entertainment', which have excluded and dismissed this body of work, women are producing films and videos on a larger scale than ever before and the demand for this material is increasing.\n\nCircles was a membership organisation. \"All women whose films Circles distribute automatically become members, which means they have the right to become involved in creating policy.\" The selection of titles was carried out by a regular Viewing Committee, composed of an open panel with wide representation from women's groups involved in production and exhibition. Pratibha Parmar notes that, in 1987, this led to the foregrounding of films by women of colour, quoting Circles member June Givanni on the creation of the short films programme 'Black Women and Invisibility': \"invisibility here is about the lack of recognition by the wider community, and to some extent the black community that there are black women film-makers working in Britain. The range of films and videos made by black women available in this country is growing.\"\n\nAccording to the catalogue, Circles organised women-only screenings at the Four Corners 50 seater cinema in Bethnal Green, London, and also in association with other women's organisations across Britain. At these events, film/video producers were invited to talk about their work. Describing Circles' business model, Caroline Merz writes that \"Circles [had a] commitment to returning the highest possible revenue to film-makers, many of whom are not waged for their work, and a refusal to undercut their rental prices by providing what would, in effect, be subsidised programming.\"\n\nMany Circles titles continue to circulate in the UK via Cinenova, and Circles' content and history were prominent in the 2011 Cinenova exhibition \"Reproductive Labour\" at London's The Showroom gallery. \nHolland and Harris comment that: \"Circles has had an impact far out of proportion to its small size and chronic financial insecurity.\" \n\n\n \n"}

It was released on October 9, 2015.\n\nIn the aftermath of the first wave of colonies, the people of Earth continue to struggle for existence. New factions have arisen and have launched a new wave of colonies off planet.\n\n\"Rising Tide\" brings new features including expanded water gameplay (which includes floating cities), hybrid affinities, a completely revamped diplomacy system, and an expanded exploration system.\n\nThe expansion adds several new dimensions to aquatic gameplay. Unlike land based cities, or even ocean cities in previous iterations of the game, aquatic based cities can move. Movement, rather than culture, is the way aquatic cities expand their borders. Aquatic cities produce less unhealth, produce more energy and culture, and can create naval units much faster than land based cities. However, they are much harder to defend, and are less efficient at producing land and air units as land based cities would. On top of these differences several wonders and buildings are exclusive to either land or aquatic cities. Workers in \"RT\" can build farms on aquatic tiles, and they have an expanded number of aquatic tile types they can improve. When viewing at ocean tiles, water is transparent rather than blue allowing players to see the ocean floor. This graphical enhancement allows for players to see resources under the ocean.\n\nHybrid affinities add another twist to the Beyond Earth experience. In the original game, players are encouraged to earn points toward one of the affinities supremacy, harmony, or purity. The game favored choosing one affinity to level up while ignoring the other two. In \"Rising Tide\", players are encouraged to level up all their affinities at the same time. Several new units of the game can only be built if the player has points from multiple affinities.\n\nWhile the base \"Beyond Earth\" game used a diplomatic system derived straight from \"Civilization V\", diplomacy in \"Rising Tide\" is described as \"completely rebuilt from scratch\". Players can earn a new type of currency, diplomatic capital. Factions can earn this capital with certain buildings and wonders, and they can earn it trading with other factions. Each faction can use this capital to buy personality trait bonuses. Diplomatic capital can also be used to build new units and buildings but it can not be used to buy new tiles. The AI has a respect and fear factor. Players who the AI deems high in respect or fear may enter more beneficial relationships. Players with low fear or respect ratings are more likely to go to war. When entering a war, players now earn a war score. When entering peace negotiations, the higher the war score a player earns, the more concessions a player may get from the losing faction.\n\nExploration has an expanded role in \"Rising Tide\". Players can find three types of artifacts: Old World Relics, Alien Biology Artifacts, and Progenitor Artifacts. When a player receives an artifact they may cash in these artifacts early for quick bonuses, or they can combine different artifacts to unlock different wonders, buildings or unit bonuses. Players may also discover Planetary Marvels. When a Marvel is discovered a planetwide quest is unlocked, which when completed provides many bonuses. Each biome has a different marvel.\n\nOn top of these changes to exploration, explorers can perform expeditions on water tiles. Players can now leash Aliens using explorers allowing players to capture armies of aliens to fight for them.\n\n\"Rising Tide\" adds two new biomes: frigid, an ice world, and primordial, a geologically active world. Aliens have different color patterns in each biome and will behave differently depending on what biome they are in. For example, aliens in a frigid biome tend to be fewer in number but stronger while those in a lush biome would be larger in number yet weaker.\n\nFour new sponsors have also been added: Chungsu, Al Falah, the North Sea Alliance, and INTEGR. Chungsu comes from the Korean Peninsula. This faction excels at espionage and can build its founding city on water tiles. Al Falah comes from Arabia. Unlike the rest of the colonists, Al Falah colonists lived in generational ships rather than being cryogenically frozen on sleeper ships. The colonists from this faction have never seen Earth, and its culture has evolved as such. This faction gets bonuses in City development. The North Sea Alliance comes from the British Isles and the Nordic region. This faction gets bonuses in water tiles, and can build its founding city on water tiles. INTEGR comes from Germany. It gains bonuses in the new diplomacy system. The \"Beyond Earth\" spinoff game, \"Sid Meier's Starships\" does not include the new sponsors introduced in \"Rising Tide\".\n\nThe development of \"Rising Tide\" was announced on May 18, 2015. The game was released on October 9, 2015. Several new features have been added post launch. A spoils of war system has been added to allow victors in war to pick what they want from the defeated foes. A black market has been added to allow players to buy or sell resources for diplomatic capital. The AI is much more aggressive toward players close to the completion of wonders or to victory.\n\nGameRankings gave it an 80.56% rating while Metacritic rated it 81/100.\n\n"}

Coleridge's biographer Richard Holmes summarised the range of material covered as \"travels, reading, dreams, nature studies, self-confession and self-analysis, philosophical theories, friendships, sexual fantasies, lecture notes, observations of his children, literary schemes, brewing recipes, opium addiction, horrors, puns, prayers.\" Some of this vast storehouse of material found its way into Coleridge's published works, and it is also believed to have directly influenced Wordsworth's poems. The notebooks have been described as \"unique in the annals of Romantic autobiography\", and as \"perhaps the unacknowledged prose masterpiece of the age\".\n\nColeridge originally had no intention of making his notebooks public, but in his later years he came to think of them as a legacy to be passed down to his disciples. He even allowed his friend Robert Southey to use a number of extracts in their collaborative work \"Omniana\", published in 1812 and reprinted in an expanded form in 1836. In 1895 the poet's grandson Ernest Hartley Coleridge released a larger selection under the title \"Anima Poetæ\", and the following year the scholar Alois Brandl published in Germany an edition of the first notebook. The notebooks were not made available in a complete form until Kathleen Coburn produced the lavishly annotated Bollingen Edition. Coburn began work on this in the 1930s; the first volume appeared in 1957, and the fifth and final one (completed by Anthony John Harding) in 2002, 11 years after her death. Work is in progress on an electronic index to this edition. In 2002 a new selection from the notebooks, restricted to those kept in the British Library, was published under the editorship of Seamus Perry.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34024176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34024176", "title": "El Rio de Luz", "text": "El Rio de Luz\n\nEl Rio de Luz (Spanish for The River of Light; also known as Morning in the Tropics) is an 1877 oil painting by American landscape artist Frederic Edwin Church. It is his last large-scale painting of South America, following pieces such as \"The Andes of Ecuador\" (1855) and \"The Heart of the Andes\" (1859). Like them, the painting is a composite of the many sketches and drawings Church made while traveling in South America twenty years earlier. \n\nThe work differs in important ways from Church's earlier, monumental South American canvases. While a high degree of realism and attention to detail remains, the landscape in \"The River of Light\" is more local; it no longer attempts to capture numerous topographies or climate zones in one image. As a result, the composition is more intimate than other South American works. The National Gallery of Art notes that \"the tightly focused realism, the overall tonal harmony and restrained coloration, and the compositional unity all lend a remarkable cohesiveness to the work\". The vantage point is no longer high and detached, but seemingly low enough that a viewer might stand there. Details include a canoeist, a flock of birds over the river and two others (possibly the amethyst woodstar hummingbird) perched close to the viewer, and a hut on the right bank. \n\nChurch's once-stellar reception by the 1870s had diminished, though he was still prominent; his work was often criticized for an excess of detail and a sense of melodrama. In 1880 art critic William Crary Brownell called it \"a magnificent drop-curtain. A drop-curtain may be the work of incontestable genius; it may have a thousand merits; ... it is simply not painting.\" In the 1960s, Church scholar David C. Huntington offered interpretive reminders of the symbolism of Church's art for its 19th-century American audience, who were Christians optimistic about the future of their young country (though the Civil War, a decade past, tempered these feelings):\n\nAs in \"The Andes of Ecuador\", the sunlight forms a subtle cross. Huntington finds in the painting the influence of Gustave Doré's for \"Paradise Lost\", of engravings after J. M. W. Turner such as \"Bacchus and Ariadne\", and illustrated books on the tropics, such as those by Paul Marcoy.\n\nThe painting was exhibited in New York in 1877 at the Century Association (called \"A Tropical Morning\"), and in 1878 at \"Exposition Universelle\".\n\nWilliam Earl Dodge, Jr. (1832–1903) was the first owner of the work and passed it to his descendants, who reported that the painting had once been called \"The Amazon\". In 1965, it was given to the Preservation Society of Newport County, Rhode Island, and purchased in December 1965 by the National Gallery of Art. The painting was restored in 1988.\n\n"}

{"id": "38558185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38558185", "title": "Everyday Aesthetics", "text": "Everyday Aesthetics\n\nEveryday Aesthetics is a recent subfield of philosophical aesthetics focusing on everyday events, settings and activities in which the faculty of sensibility is saliently at stake. Alexander Baumgarten established Aesthetics as a discipline and defined it as \"scientia cognitionis sensitivae\", the science of sensory knowledge, in his foundational work \"Aesthetica\" (1750). This field has been dedicated since then to the clarification of fine arts, beauty and taste only marginally referring to the aesthetics in design, crafts, urban environments and social practice until the emergence of everyday aesthetics during the ‘90s. As other subfields like environmental aesthetics or the aesthetics of nature, everyday aesthetics also attempts to countervail aesthetics' almost exclusive focus on the philosophy of art.\n\nAesthetic inquiry on everyday life owes much of its approach to John Dewey’s (1934) pragmatist aesthetics, even if he was interested in grounding mainly artistic experience. Dewey pointed at a variety of circumstances in which sensibility is present emphasizing the importance of feeling, energy, and rhythm in every creature’s intercourse with its environment. He thus stressed not only the artistic but the everyday doings and undergoings that involve alertness and intensity of experience. Dewey explored aesthetics from the subjects' experience rather than from objects' status as artworks and museum collections. This turn would allow overcoming object-centric approaches to aesthetics that hindered any consideration of the aesthetic beyond artistic and beautiful things justifiable by intrinsic qualities categorized as aesthetic.\n\nThe neglect of aesthetic theory to consider the role of sensibility in everyday life was first pointed out by Katya Mandoki who in 1994 coined the word Prosaics (drawing a distinction from Aristotle’s Poetics focused on art) to denote a sub-discipline that would specifically inquire the aesthetics involved in daily activities emphasizing the styles and forms of expression in face-to-face and context determined interactions. Prosaics or the theory of everyday aesthetics analyzes in this and subsequent texts the social conventions on what is considered acceptable or not by implicit standards of taste in each institutional setting (school, family, religion, politics, artworld, medical practice, sports). Six books and several articles i.e. \"Everyday Aesthetics; Prosaics, social identities and the play of culture\" (2007) consistently analyze the wide spectrum of the non-artistic within personal and collective experience. The role of the aesthetic is examined through symbolic interaction, identity negotiation and dramaturgical performance to produce specific sensitive effects and impact upon sensibility. As a multi-sensorial phenomenon, prosaics pays attention to the whole range of sensorial display for affecting participants' sensibility (body language, the visual, setting and props, intonation and styles of language) and not only sight and hearing as has been customary in aesthetics.\n\nAn approach to everyday aesthetics involves both the positive and negative, the enriching and the toxic effects operating on sensibility. Joseph H. Kupfer brought to the attention of aesthetic inquiry the importance of focusing on the effects of violence and ultraviolence in modern society. Kupfer makes explicit the aesthetic ground of violence in society and emphasizes destruction as an aesthetic process producing vivid sensations. He highlighted also the need of incorporating aesthetics to education not only by means of teaching art but aesthetically, i.e. in the manner itself of educating through the rhythm, organization of subject matter, and method of presentation to engage students with the content of study. Mandoki points at the negative use of aesthetics for manipulating emotions in the political sphere and refers to Nazi propaganda as a case in point that exemplifies the deliberate use of aesthetics for exerting violence. The utilization of aesthetics for political agendas, specifically in the legitimation of the nation-state is dealt by this author. Arnold Berleant has stressed the negative aspect of everyday aesthetics pointing at the importance of the aesthetic impact of terrorism as well as the use of aesthetics in the political sphere. Berleant brings up other extreme situations that provoke perceptual injury or damage as contemporary urban overcrowding and visual over stimulation, space pollution, claustrophobic and oppressive conditions. For Berleant, aesthetics implies active, intense aesthetic engagement and is thus involved in both positive and negative effects of everyday contemporary urban settings. For Berleant aesthetics of the environment has been a sustained object of research for more than two decades. Since 1970, he has insisted on the importance of aesthetics as a field of experience and active engagement in which our quality of life depends.\n\nYi-Fu Tuan proposed that we should apply the traditional aesthetic categories of beauty, contemplation, disinterestedness, and distancing in valuing daily life through different non artistic objects and locations. Already in 1974 he insisted on the need of paying due attention to the environment as object of aesthetic appreciation. Along this line Crispin Sartwell also proposed in 1995 applying aesthetics to life itself. Yuriko Saito, an environmentalist aesthetician specializing in Japanese aesthetics, argues for paying attention to weather as worthy of aesthetic appreciation and for making moral and aesthetic judgments on everyday artifacts, landscapes, lawns, and neighborhood eyesores that are conflicting with the harmony of the environment. Saito advocates a self-critical artification of everyday life and warns about the risks of artificating business. Paulina Rautio has performed qualitative analysis by interviews and epistolary exchange with women in regards to their experience of beauty through non artistic items and their contexts such as hanging laundry in Lapland where the opportunity of drying clothes under the sun is rare. There is a common interest in this approach for understanding aesthetics as a theory of art and beauty following traditional categories and at the same time attempting to go beyond conventional borders of art by artificating the non art and extending its scope to everyday objects, environments and to living itself. That is the case of Horacio Pérez-Henao who tries to interpret literature under the scope of everyday aesthetics by pointing out how fictional characters experience aesthetics into their daily lives .\n\nEvery work of art has, since the Renaissance, tried to expand themes worthy of artistic expression and concepts of artistic value to include new subject matters, techniques and styles in painting and sculpture, new harmonies, consonances or dissonances in music, new attitudes, gestures, and different genres and requirements of quality. However the initiative of applying the concept of art literally to non artistic activities within a theoretical framework related to everyday aesthetics came from philosophers like David Best, Wolfgang Welsch and Lev Kreft proposing to consider sports as an art form. Feminist aestheticians are also advocating for the inclusion of other senses beyond the two traditional sight and hearing, as in taste (Carolyn Korsmeyer) and smell (Emily Brady), that can render aesthetic experiences in daily life.\nCarolyn Korsmeyer, M. Quinet and Glenn Kuehn argue for including food among aesthetically relevant objects and experiences.\n\nAnother line emerging from analytic aesthetics and the American Society of Aesthetics has been lately discussing the expansion of aesthetics’ category repertoire to include other qualities (cuteness, prettiness, messiness, neatness, cuddleness loveliness, organized, disorganized) as well as other types of ordinary experiences (i.e. scratching an itch, playing with a pencil).\n\nBourdieu, Pierre \"Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste\" (London: Routledge Kegan Paul 1984).\n\nDe Certeau, Michel \"The Practice of Everyday Life\" (Berkeley: University of California 1998).\n\nDickie, George \"The Myth of the Aesthetic Attitude” Philip Alperson (ed). \"The Philosophy of the Visual Arts\" (New York/Oxford: Oxford University Press 1992).\n\nDufrenne, Mikel \"In the Presence of the Sensuous\" Roberts, Mark.S.

Conformed in its entirety with previously unseen historical footage and documents, the film reconstructs the life of the former Argentine first lady from an unbiased perspective. The film starts with a meticulous examination of Evita Duarte's origins, her relationship with her parents (particularly her father) and her siblings. \"Evita\" goes on to reveal intimate aspects of Duarte's early childhood and adolescence, leading to her resolving to flee her home in the countryside for the capital city of Buenos Aires. The latter segments of the film are highlighted by interviews with former teachers from her elementary schooling in Junin, a small city in the province of Buenos Aires. Throughout the film, the director is steadily reminding the audience of the domestic and international context out of which Evita Duarte emerged, enhancing the viewer's understanding of the facts. The second act of the film concludes with her funeral in Buenos Aires. The third act exposes the macabre plot to have Evita Peron's corpse disappear, and looks at the curious series of events leading to the exchange of cadavers between the so-called Peronist youth and the military regime. \"Evita\" premiered in the US on WCVE Richmond-PBS, and WHTJ Charlottesville-PBS on July 12, 2012. \"Evita\" has been included in courses on Political Science and History.

The FCA soon had chapters across the country, and was one of the main forces behind formation of the Canada Council in 1957. After this, the national organization withered, and only the British Columbia chapter remained active. A drive for expansion began in 1977, causing a renewal of activity that started in western Canada and then spread. Expansion stalled out in the late 1990s when funding cuts hit the Federation as hard as it hit other arts organization. Renewed vigor by volunteers and staff in recent years has brought new life to the Federation and expansion is again underway. The organization has about 2,700 paying members and 5,000 artist contacts throughout Canada as of the end of 2017, a permanent gallery in Vancouver, and organizes approximately 44 exhibitions every year. \n\nAndré Charles Biéler organized the first conference of Canadian artists in 1941.\nThis conference, held in Kingston, Ontario, led to the foundation of the Federation of Canadian Artists.\nAt his opening address at the Kingston conference Bieler insisted that \"we should not try to unify ourselves or to attempt to make a school that would cover the whole country. \nOn the contrary, I believe we must keep that regional aspect.\"\nThe Federation of Canadian Artists was founded in Toronto by a group of Canadian artists. Biéler was the first president.\n\nThe Federation was divided into regions, each with a regional organizer. \nLawren Harris of the Group of Seven was head of the West Coast region.\nThe other organizers were Gordon Sinclair (Western region), Ernest Lindner (Saskatchewan), Byllee Lang (Manitoba), A. Y. Jackson (Ontario) and Walter Abell (Maritimes).\n\nWriting in \"Maritime Art\" (February–March 1943) Arthur Lismer proposed that the goals of the Federation were to improve understanding of the role of artists in society, to encourage youth while supporting established artists and to bring art to the community.\nThe FCA became a powerful national lobby for public patronage of the arts, recognized as the legitimate representative of Canadian artists.\nJ. Delisle Parker wrote in February 1945, \"This is not just another art society, nor is it intended to replace any existing art society. It is an organization formed to unite all the artists in Canada, whether member of existing societies or not, in a federation which it is hoped will become a power in the country. The Federation hopes to bridge the isolation of artists in different parts of the country, discover talent and organize regional as well as country-wide activities and to publish an art magazine to serve the interests of art and artists in the country as a whole...\"\n\nWalter Abell's journal \"Maritime Art\" became \"Canadian Art\" in 1943 when Abell moved to Ottawa to join the staff of the Art Centre of the National Gallery of Canada.\nThe Federation sponsored \"Canadian Art\", which was the only national art magazine in the 1940s.\n\"Canadian Art\" became an important vehicle for communication between artists, curators and collectors.\nIn June 1944 the Federation and other national art organizations prepared a brief on cultural aspects of Canadian post-war reconstruction. \nThis led to the formation of the Canadian Arts Council.\nThe FCA was a key member of the Canadian Arts Council after it was founded in 1944.\nAt first the FCA sponsored lectures and plays in addition to exhibitions and workshops. After about 1949 it began to focus on the visual arts.\n\nThe FCA made a major presentation to the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, the Massey Commission, in Vancouver in 1949.\nThe presentation was instrumental in forming the Canada Council, which came into being in 1957.\nThe FCA began to phase itself out as a national organization after this as communication across Canada became easier.\nBy the 1960s there was little activity at the national level, although the regional branches persisted. In British Columbia there were 600 members.\n\nIn 1977 Allan Edwards of the Vancouver branch, by now almost all that was left of the FCA, became president and began a drive for expansion.\nThe FCA organized traveling exhibitions in British Columbia and Alberta, with some going to the east of Canada or the USA.\nIn the 1980s the FCA began to organize annual painting seminars on Saltspring Island, which drew students from across western Canada and the USA.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44706", "title": "Genre", "text": "Genre\n\nGenre () is any form or type of communication in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) with socially-agreed upon conventions developed over time. Genre is most popularly known as a category of literature, music, or other forms of art or entertainment, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria, yet genres can be aesthetic, rhetorical, communicative, or functional. Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility.\n\nGenre began as an absolute classification system for ancient Greek literature. Poetry (odes, epics, etc.), prose, and performance each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best.\n\nIn later periods genres proliferated and developed in response to changes in audiences and creators. Genre became a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictable art. Because art is often a response to a social state, in that people write/paint/sing/dance about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings.\n\nGenre suffers from the ills of any classification system. It has been suggested that genres resonate with people because of the familiarity, the shorthand communication, as well as because of the tendency of genres to shift with public mores and to reflect the zeitgeist. While the genre of storytelling has been relegated as lesser form of art because of the heavily borrowed nature of the conventions, admiration has grown. Proponents argue that the genius of an effective genre piece is in the variation, recombination, and evolution of the codes.\n\nThe term \"genre\" is much used in the history and criticism of visual art, but in art history has meanings that overlap rather confusingly. Genre painting is a term for paintings where the main subject features human figures to whom no specific identity attachesin other words, figures are not portraits, characters from a story, or allegorical personifications. These are distinguished from staffage: incidental figures in what is primarily a landscape or architectural painting. \"Genre painting\" may also be used as a wider term covering genre painting proper, and other specialized types of paintings such as still-life, landscapes, marine paintings and animal paintings.\n\nThe concept of the \"hierarchy of genres\" was a powerful one in artistic theory, especially between the 17th and 19th centuries. It was strongest in France, where it was associated with the Académie française which held a central role in academic art. The genres in hierarchical order are:\n\nA literary genre is a category of literary composition. Genres may be determined by literary technique, tone, content, or even (as in the case of fiction) length. Genre should not be confused with age category, by which literature may be classified as either adult, young adult, or children's. They also must not be confused with format, such as graphic novel or picture book. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups.\n\nThe most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) epic, tragedy, comedy, novel, and short story. They can all be in the genres prose or poetry, which shows best how loosely genres are defined. Additionally, a genre such as satire might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general cultural movement of the historical period in which they were composed. In popular fiction, which is especially divided by genres, genre fiction is the more usual term.\n\nIn literature, genre has been known as an intangible taxonomy. This taxonomy implies a concept of containment or that an idea will be stable forever.The earliest recorded systems of genre in Western history can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle. Gérard Genette, a French literary theorist and author of \"The Architext\", describes Plato as creating three Imitational genres: dramatic dialogue, pure narrative, and epic (a mixture of dialogue and narrative). Lyric poetry, the fourth and final type of Greek literature, was excluded by Plato as a non-mimetic mode. Aristotle later revised Plato's system by eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode and distinguishing by two additional criteria: the object to be imitated, as objects could be either superior or inferior, and the medium of presentation such as words, gestures or verse. Essentially, the three categories of mode, object, and medium can be visualized along an XYZ axis.\n\nExcluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: tragedy (superior-dramatic dialogue), epic (superior-mixed narrative), comedy (inferior-dramatic dialogue), and parody (inferior-mixed narrative). Genette continues by explaining the later integration of lyric poetry into the classical system during the romantic period, replacing the now removed pure narrative mode. Lyric poetry, once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third leg of a new tripartite system: lyrical, epical, and dramatic dialogue. This system, which came to \"dominate all the literary theory of German romanticism (and therefore well beyond)…\" (38), has seen numerous attempts at expansion or revision. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing scope and complexity.\n\nGenette reflects upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: \"its structure is somewhat superior to…those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse\" (74). Taxonomy allows for a structured classification system of genre, as opposed to a more contemporary rhetorical model of genre.\n\nThe basic genres of film can be regarded as drama, in the feature film and most cartoons, and documentary. Most dramatic feature films, especially from Hollywood fall fairly comfortably into one of a long list of film genres such as the Western, war film, horror film, romantic comedy film, musical, crime film, and many others. Many of these genres have a number of subgenres, for example by setting or subject, or a distinctive national style, for example in the Indian Bollywood musical.\n\nA music genre is a conventional category that identifies pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from \"musical form\" and \"musical style\", although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. There are numerous genres in Western classical music and popular music, as well as musical theatre and the music of non-Western cultures. The term is now perhaps over-used to describe relatively small differences in musical style in modern rock music, that also may reflect sociological differences in their audiences. Timothy Laurie suggests that in the context of rock and pop music studies, the \"appeal of genre criticism is that it makes narratives out of musical worlds that often seem to lack them\".\n\nMusic can be divided into different genres in several ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often arbitrary and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are several academic approaches to genres. In his book \"Form in Tonal Music\", Douglass M. Green lists madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the Renaissance period. According to Green, \"Beethoven's \"Op. 61\" and Mendelssohn's \"Op. 64\" are identical in genre – both are violin concertos – but different in form. However, Mozart's \"Rondo for Piano, K. 511\", and the \"Agnus Dei\" from his \"Mass, K. 317\" are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\" Some, like Peter van der Merwe, treat the terms \"genre\" and \"style\" as the same, saying that \"genre\" should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or \"basic musical language\".\n\nOthers, such as Allan F. Moore, state that \"genre\" and \"style\" are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres. A music genre or subgenre may be defined by the musical techniques, the styles, the context, and content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres.\n\nSeveral music scholars have criticised the priority accorded to genre-based communities and listening practices. For example, Laurie argues that \"music genres do not belong to isolated, self-sufficient communities. People constantly move between environments where diverse forms of music are heard, advertised and accessorised with distinctive iconographies, narratives and celebrity identities that also touch on non-musical worlds.\"\n\nThe concept of genre is often applied, sometimes rather loosely, to other media with an artistic element, such as video game genres. Genre, and numerous minutely divided subgenres, affect popular culture very significantly, not least as they are used to classify it for publicity purposes. The vastly increased output of popular culture in the age of electronic media encourages dividing cultural products by genre to simplify the search for products by consumers, a trend the Internet has only intensified.\n\nIn philosophy of language, genre figures prominently in the works of philosopher and literary scholar Mikhail Bakhtin. Bakhtin's basic observations were of \"speech genres\" (the idea of heteroglossia), modes of speaking or writing that people learn to mimic, weave together, and manipulate (such as \"formal letter\" and \"grocery list\", or \"university lecture\" and \"personal anecdote\"). In this sense, genres are socially specified: recognized and defined (often informally) by a particular culture or community. The work of Georg Lukács also touches on the nature of literary genres, appearing separately but around the same time (1920s–1930s) as Bakhtin. Norman Fairclough has a similar concept of genre that emphasizes the social context of the text: Genres are \"different ways of (inter)acting discoursally\" (Fairclough, 2003: 26).\n\nA text's genre may be determined by its:\n\n\nIn the field of rhetoric, genre theorists usually understand genres as types of actions rather than types or forms of texts. On this perspective, texts are channels through which genres are enacted. Carolyn Miller's work has been especially important for this perspective. Drawing on Lloyd Bitzer's concept of rhetorical situation, Miller reasons that recurring rhetorical problems tend to elicit recurring responses; drawing on Alfred Schütz, she reasons that these recurring responses become \"typified\" – that is, socially constructed as recognizable types. Miller argues that these \"typified rhetorical actions\" (p. 151) are properly understood as genres.\n\nBuilding off of Miller, Charles Bazerman and Clay Spinuzzi have argued that genres understood as actions derive their meaning from other genres – that is, other actions. Bazerman therefore proposes that we analyze genres in terms of \"genre systems\", while Spinuzzi prefers the closely related concept of \"genre ecologies\".\n\nThis tradition has had implications for the teaching of writing in American colleges and universities. Combining rhetorical genre theory with activity theory, David Russell has proposed that standard English composition courses are ill-suited to teach the genres that students will write in other contexts across the university and beyond. Elizabeth Wardle contends that standard composition courses do teach genres, but that these are inauthentic \"mutt genres\" that are often of little use outside of composition courses.\n\nThis concept of genre originated from the classification systems created by Plato. Plato divided literature into the three classic genres accepted in Ancient Greece: poetry, drama, and prose. Poetry is further subdivided into epic, lyric, and drama. The divisions are recognized as being set by Aristotle and Plato; however, they were not the only ones. Many genre theorists added to these accepted forms of poetry.\n\nThe earliest recorded systems of genre in Western history can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle. Gérard Genette explains his interpretation of the history of genre in \"The Architext\". He described Plato as the creator of three imitational, mimetic genres distinguished by mode of imitation rather than content. These three imitational genres include dramatic dialogue, the drama; pure narrative, the dithyramb; and a mixture of the two, the epic. Plato excluded lyric poetry as a non-mimetic, imitational mode. Genette further discussed how Aristotle revised Plato's system by first eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode. He then uses two additional criteria to distinguish the system. The first of the criteria is the object to be imitated, whether superior or inferior. The second criterion is the medium of presentation: words, gestures, or verse. Essentially, the three categories of mode, object, and medium can be visualized along an XYZ axis. Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: tragedy, epic, comedy, and parody.\n\nGenette explained the integration of lyric poetry into the classical system by replacing the removed pure narrative mode. Lyric poetry, once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third \"Architext\", a term coined by Gennette, of a new long-enduring tripartite system: lyrical; epical, the mixed narrative; and dramatic, the dialogue. This new system that came to \"dominate all the literary theory of German romanticism\" (Genette 38) has seen numerous attempts at expansion and revision. Such attempts include Friedrich Schlegel's triad of subjective form, the lyric; objective form, the dramatic; and subjective-objective form, the epic. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing complexity. Gennette reflected upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: \"its structure is somewhat superior to most of those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse\".\n\nGenre is embedded in culture but may clash with it at times. There are occasions in which a cultural group may not be inclined to keep within the set structures of a genre. Anthony Pare's studied Inuit social workers in \"Genre and Identity: Individuals, Institutions and Ideology\". In this study, Pare described the conflict between the genre of Inuit social workers' record keeping forms and the cultural values that prohibited them from fully being able to fulfill the expectations of this genre. Amy Devitt further expands on the concept of culture in her 2004 essay, \"A Theory of Genre\" by adding \"culture defines what situations and genres are likely or possible\" (Devitt 24).\n\nGenre not only coexists with culture but also defines its very components. Genres abound in daily life and people often work within them unconsciously; people often take for granted their prominence and ever present residence in society. Devitt touches on Miller's idea of situation, but expands on it and adds that the relationship with genre and situation is reciprocal. Individuals may find themselves shaping the rhetorical situations, which in turn affect the rhetorical responses that arise out of the situation. Because the social workers worked closely with different families, they did not want to disclose many of the details that are standard in the genre of record keeping related to this field. Giving out such information would violate close cultural ties with the members of their community.\n\nAlthough genres are not always precisely definable, genre considerations are one of the most important factors in determining what a person will see or read. The classification properties of genre can attract or repel potential users depending on the individual's understanding of a genre.\n\nGenre creates an expectation in that expectation is met or not. Many genres have built-in audiences and corresponding publications that support them, such as magazines and websites. Inversely, audiences may call out for change in an antecedent genre and create an entirely new genre.\n\nThe term may be used in categorizing web pages, like \"news page\" and \"fan page\", with both very different layout, audience, and intention (Rosso, 2008). Some search engines like Vivísimo try to group found web pages into automated categories in an attempt to show various genres the search hits might fit.\n\nA subgenre is a subordinate within a genre. Two stories being the same genre can still sometimes differ in subgenre. For example, if a fantasy story has darker and more frightening elements of fantasy, it would belong in the subgenre of dark fantasy; whereas another fantasy story that features magic swords and wizards would belong to the subgenre of sword and sorcery.\n\n\n\n"}

Her efforts made the studio one of the key independent US film studios in the nickelodeon and transitional era, praised for its erudite adaptations of Shakespeare and other \"classical\" stage dramas to the screen.\n\nGertrude Homan was born in 1882 (one family account gives the date as 1880) in Beauvoir, Mississippi, one of ten children in her family. When she was very young, the family moved to Brooklyn, New York, and she became involved in acting as a child, performing her first stage role at the age of six. As a child actress, her theatrical parts included title roles in \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" and \"Editha's Burglar\". In the 1890s she was part of a stock company in Milwaukee that was managed by Edwin Thanhouser, whom she married in 1900.\nIn the spring of 1909, Gertrude moved with her husband to New Rochelle, New York where they established Thanhouser Company as an independent motion picture studio; it was the first to be organized by leaders with strong theatrical training. Gertrude's acting career of fourteen years gave her the stagecraft to be a powerful and creative force in this new venture. She received co-scenario writing credit with brother-in-law, Lloyd Lonergan, for the screen adaptation of Shakespeare's \"The Winter's Tale\". Behind the scenes, Gertrude was heavily involved in scenario development, creation of mise en scène and film editing. In 1912, the Thanhousers sold their shares in the company to Charles J. Hite of Mutual Film Corporation for $250,000 and retired from the industry.\n\nIn August 1914, Hite was killed in an automobile accident. In February 1915, the Mutual board of directors in an extraordinary move lured Edwin and Gertrude out of retirement. Gertrude immediately resumed her role as supervisor of the scenario department and was credited for writing the scenario for their first \"new\" release, \"Their One Love\". She remained active in company affairs including attending a meeting with President Woodrow Wilson in 1916. In the summer of 1916 the death of Thanhouser leading actress Florence LaBadie and the rise of feature films with stars such as Mary Pickford contributed to the decline in popularity of the studio's films. In 1918, the founders retired permanently from the film industry leaving the Thanhouser Film Corporation with a positive bank balance, unlike many others of the era.\n\n"}

While there is uncertainty about her place of birth, Holmes stated in an interview that she was born on a farm in South Bend, Indiana, but grew up in Chicago, Illinois. A 1917 article indicates Holmes was born on her father's private railroad car, \"Estevan\".\n\nHolmes was the daughter of Norwegian immigrant Louis A. Holmes (born in Norway in October 1862), a railroad clerk employed by the Illinois Central Railroad, who had migrated to the United States in 1867, and his wife Sophia (born April 1869 in Indiana), and was the sister of Frank O. Holmes (born June 1889 in Illinois) and Florence (born in May 1896 in Illinois), and two other siblings who died in infancy.\n\nHolmes was educated in St Mary's Convent in South Bend, Indiana.\n\nHolmes began working as a photographer's model but turned to acting, performing in live theatre and making her Broadway debut in 1909. She became friends with film star Mabel Normand.\n\nDue to tuberculosis in the family, about 1910 Holmes and her widowed mother and siblings moved to California Valley, a few miles east of Shoshone in Death Valley, California, where they lost their life savings in a real estate swindle buying a property by the Colorado River.\n\nMeanwhile, Mabel Normand moved to Hollywood in 1912 to work at Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios, and she encouraged Holmes, after her brother had died, to try the film business in the balmier climes of the West Coast.\n\nHolmes began her film career in 1912 with Keystone in a bit part arranged by Mabel Normand. She made only a few more appearances in Keystone films and, although attractive, her lack of glamorous beauty relegated her to secondary roles until late 1913 when she signed with the Kalem Company's new Hollywood studio.\n\nHelen Holmes' first film at Kalem was directed by J.P. McGowan, with whom she would develop a relationship and soon marry. In her first two years with Kalem Studios, Holmes appeared in more than thirty film shorts during which time her athletic ability to do physically demanding stunts led to her big break.\n\nAt a time when the women's suffrage movement was much in the news, in March 1914 Kalem Studios' competitor Pathé Frères released an adventure film serial titled \"The Perils of Pauline\". Starring Pearl White as a bold and daring heroine, the Pathé serial became an enormous box-office success. As a result, Kalem Studios jumped on the bandwagon and in November 1914 released their own adventure series called \"The Hazards of Helen\".\n\nCast as the series star, during the twenty-six \"thrill-a-minute\" episodes in which Helen Holmes performed, she did almost all of her own stunts. Playing an independent, quick-thinking and inventive heroine, as part of her dangerous exploits Helen did such things as leap onto runaway trains or treacherously chase after bad guy train robbers. While occasionally the plot called for Helen to be rescued by a handsome male hero, in most episodes it was the dauntless Helen herself who found an ingenious way out of her dire predicament and single-handedly collared the bad guys, bringing them to justice. \n\"The Hazards of Helen\" made Holmes a major star and she and her now husband, director J.P McGowan, decided to capitalize on her fame and left Kalem to work for Thomas H. Ince Productions and Universal Pictures. After a few films, Holmes and McGowan formed Signal Film Productions to make their own adventure films. Between late 1915 and early 1917, they made a dozen films together that met with reasonable success but financial and distribution problems ended the production partnership and Holmes did not appear in another film until 1919, this time as the star in another film company's production. In 1919 and 1920 she made only one film each year and only two in each of the next three years. Between 1924 and 1926 Helen Holmes made eighteen more short adventure films, but her popularity began to wane in a market over-saturated with female cliffhanger films. Holmes made several Westerns opposite actor and rodeo performer Jack Hoxie in the mid-1920s.\n\nThroughout her career Helen Holmes had occasionally gone back to performing in the theatre, and with the end of her marriage in 1925 she returned to the stage, making her last appearance on Broadway in 1935. She eventually married film stuntman Lloyd A. Saunders and as a result of the popularity of the Rin Tin Tin dog films, the two began training animals for use in the movies.\n\nAfter retiring from movies Helen ran a small antique business in her San Fernando home. She had an extensive collection of rare dolls.\n\nLloyd died in 1946, and Helen died in 1950 as a result of heart failure. She had been ill for five years with a heart condition. She died in Burbank, California at her home, 1401 West Olive Street. She was 58 years old. Funeral services were conducted at Pierce Brothers Hollywood Chapel at 5959 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, California. She was interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\n\n\n"}

There are two parts to the HCRP: the remaking of the historic area and the restoration of its monuments.\n\nThe Historic Cairo Restoration Project is a project started by the governments of Egypt and Cairo. The main project's intention is to create new museums in a sequence of historical sites in an open-air museum district, that will be widely accessible to both the citizens of Cairo and tourists. The project is currently focused on restoring historic landmarks from the medieval Fatamid era in Cairo (969 CE - 1250 CE). The number of potential historic monuments is estimated between 450 and 630 structures.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Culture, the HCRP plan is to \"transform the whole area into an open-air museum.\" The HCRP is first focusing on this Islamic arts district in order to be a part of the Museum With No Frontiers. This is a museum organized by the European Union, and the Fatimid area project will be a part of its Euromed Heritage program — \"Islamic Art in the Mediterranean.\" \n\nA primary concept of the project is to feature the actual historical sites as the main exhibits for this open-air museum by providing extensive information resources and catalogs on-site at each of them. Visitors would therefore be able to truly experience medieval Egyptian culture and history by seeing the structures and sites while concurrently learning more about them from the on-site resources.\n\nAs a part of this project, to increase pedestrian accessibility there are plans to create a paved walkway along al-Muizz li-Din Allah, the main ceremonial path of Fatimid Cairo. There are also plans to demolish less significant adjacent vernacular structures to create large garden settings surrounding the landmarks.\n\nThe HCRP has issued many plans, which have been met with resistance by some Cairens, the citizens of Cairo. For example, the plans to create gardens and walkways is seen by some as an assault on the original dense medieval layout and 'urban fabric' of Fatimid Cairo that diminishes the historical value of the retained sites.\n\nThe reasoning is that in Medieval Cairo, the context of a building was determined by its relationship to neighboring buildings. Buildings and monuments of importance were intentionally constructed adjacent to conventional ones, to convey and enhance their high stature and prestige. It is this urban clustering and juxtaposition that actually gives the landmark buildings authentic context and meaning for visitors to experience. Some Cairens think that by eliminating this context from the buildings the HCRP is lessening the value and historical understanding of their heritage sites.\n\nSome architectural conservation experts have claimed the HCRP has used incorrect building materials in its conservation work. Other conservation experts counter that the massive and immediate intervention for landmarks, despite the inevitable mistakes, has stopped the threat of many just disappearing.\n\nSome residents of historic Cairo have also become suspicious of the HCRP motives, questioning if the project really has historical preservation and interpretation as its true primary intention. Some believe that tourism and commerce are instead the main reason for the project's creation and funding. The large amount of spending necessary for the intended project has also become a point of controversy, with some estimates as high as $350 million. Some residents believe that the massive cost of creating the open-air museum and restoring its landmarks would be better spent for other local public social and economic needs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13756", "title": "Hymn", "text": "Hymn\n\nA hymn is a type of song, usually religious, specifically written for the purpose of adoration or prayer, and typically addressed to a deity or deities, or to a prominent figure or personification. The word \"hymn\" derives from Greek (\"hymnos\"), which means \"a song of praise\". A writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist. The singing or composition of hymns is called hymnody. Collections of hymns are known as hymnals or hymn books. Hymns may or may not include instrumental accompaniment.\n\nAlthough most familiar to speakers of English in the context of Christianity, hymns are also a fixture of other world religions, especially on the Indian subcontinent. Hymns also survive from antiquity, especially from Egyptian and Greek cultures. Some of the oldest surviving examples of notated music are hymns with Greek texts.\n\nAncient hymns include the Egyptian \"Great Hymn to the Aten\", composed by Pharaoh Akhenaten; the Hurrian Hymn to Nikkal; the \"Vedas\", a collection of hymns in the tradition of Hinduism; and the Psalms, a collection of songs from Judaism. The Western tradition of hymnody begins with the Homeric Hymns, a collection of ancient Greek hymns, the oldest of which were written in the 7th century BC, praising deities of the ancient Greek religions. Surviving from the 3rd century BC is a collection of six literary hymns () by the Alexandrian poet Callimachus.\n\nPatristic writers began applying the term , or \"hymnus\" in Latin, to Christian songs of praise, and frequently used the word as a synonym for \"psalm\".\n\nOriginally modeled on the Book of Psalms and other poetic passages (commonly referred to as \"canticles\") in the Scriptures, Christian hymns are generally directed as praise to the Christian God. Many refer to Jesus Christ either directly or indirectly.\n\nSince the earliest times, Christians have sung \"psalms and hymns and spiritual songs\", both in private devotions and in corporate worship (; ; ; ; ; ; ; cf. ; ).\n\nNon-scriptural hymns (i.e. not psalms or canticles) from the Early Church still sung today include 'Phos Hilaron', 'Sub tuum praesidium', and 'Te Deum'.\n\nOne definition of a hymn is \"...a lyric poem, reverently and devotionally conceived, which is designed to be sung and which expresses the worshipper's attitude toward God or God's purposes in human life. It should be simple and metrical in form, genuinely emotional, poetic and literary in style, spiritual in quality, and in its ideas so direct and so immediately apparent as to unify a congregation while singing it.\"\n\nChristian hymns are often written with special or seasonal themes and these are used on holy days such as Christmas, Easter and the Feast of All Saints, or during particular seasons such as Advent and Lent. Others are used to encourage reverence for the Bible or to celebrate Christian practices such as the eucharist or baptism. Some hymns praise or address individual saints, particularly the Blessed Virgin Mary; such hymns are particularly prevalent in Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and to some extent High Church Anglicanism.\n\nA writer of hymns is known as a hymnodist, and the practice of singing hymns is called \"hymnody\"; the same word is used for the collectivity of hymns belonging to a particular denomination or period (e.g. \"nineteenth century Methodist hymnody\" would mean the body of hymns written and/or used by Methodists in the 19th century). A collection of hymns is called a \"hymnal\" or \"hymnary\". These may or may not include music. A student of hymnody is called a \"hymnologist\", and the scholarly study of hymns, hymnists and hymnody is hymnology. The music to which a hymn may be sung is a hymn tune.\n\nIn many Evangelical churches, traditional songs are classified as hymns while more contemporary worship songs are not considered hymns. The reason for this distinction is unclear, but according to some it is due to the radical shift of style and devotional thinking that began with the Jesus movement and Jesus music. Of note, in recent years, Christian traditional hymns \"have\" seen a revival in some churches, usually more Reformed or Calvinistic in nature, as modern hymn writers such as Keith and Kristyn Getty and Sovereign Grace Music have reset old lyrics to new melodies, revised old hymns and republished them, or simply written a song in accordance with Christian hymn standards such as the hymn, \"In Christ Alone\".\n\nIn ancient and medieval times, string instruments such as the harp, lyre and lute were used with psalms and hymns.\n\nSince there is a lack of musical notation in early writings, the actual musical forms in the early church can only be surmised. During the Middle Ages a rich hymnody developed in the form of Gregorian chant or plainsong. This type was sung in unison, in one of eight church modes, and most often by monastic choirs. While they were written originally in Latin, many have been translated; a familiar example is the 4th century \"Of the Father's Heart Begotten\" sung to the 11th century plainsong \"Divinum Mysterium\".\n\nLater hymnody in the Western church introduced four-part vocal harmony as the norm, adopting major and minor keys, and came to be led by organ and choir. It shares many elements with classical music.\n\nToday, except for choirs, more musically inclined congregations and \"a cappella\" congregations, hymns are typically sung in unison. In some cases complementary full settings for organ are also published, in others organists and other accompanists are expected to transcribe the four-part vocal score for their instrument of choice.\n\nTo illustrate Protestant usage, in the traditional services and liturgies of the Methodist churches, which are based upon Anglican practice, hymns are sung (often accompanied by an organ) during the processional to the altar, during the receiving of communion, during the recessional, and sometimes at other points during the service. These hymns can be found in a common book such as the United Methodist Hymnal. The Doxology is also sung after the tithes and offerings are brought up to the altar.\n\nContemporary Christian worship, as often found in Evangelicalism and Pentecostalism, may include the use of contemporary worship music played with electric guitars and the drum kit, sharing many elements with rock music.\n\nOther groups of Christians have historically excluded instrumental accompaniment, citing the absence of instruments in worship by the church in the first several centuries of its existence, and adhere to an unaccompanied \"a cappella\" congregational singing of hymns. These groups include the 'Brethren' (often both 'Open' and 'Exclusive'), the Churches of Christ, Mennonites, Primitive Baptists, and certain Reformed churches, although during the last century or so, several of these, such as the Free Church of Scotland have abandoned this stance.\n\nEastern Christianity (the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches) has a variety of ancient hymnographical traditions.\n\nByzantine chant is almost always a cappella, and instrumental accompaniment is rare. It is used to chant all forms of liturgical worship.\n\nInstruments are common in Oriental traditions. The Coptic tradition which makes use of the cymbals and the Triangle (musical instrument). The Indian Orthodox (Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church) use of the organ. The Tewahedo Churches use drums, cymbals and other instruments on certain occasions.\n\nThomas Aquinas, in the introduction to his commentary on the Psalms, defined the Christian hymn thus: \"\"Hymnus est laus Dei cum cantico; canticum autem exultatio mentis de aeternis habita, prorumpens in vocem\".\" (\"A hymn is the praise of God with song; a song is the exultation of the mind dwelling on eternal things, bursting forth in the voice.\")\n\nThe Protestant Reformation resulted in two conflicting attitudes towards hymns. One approach, the regulative principle of worship, favoured by many Zwinglians, Calvinists and some radical reformers, considered anything that was not directly authorised by the Bible to be a novel and Catholic introduction to worship, which was to be rejected. All hymns that were not direct quotations from the Bible fell into this category. Such hymns were banned, along with any form of instrumental musical accompaniment, and organs were removed from churches. Instead of hymns, biblical psalms were chanted, most often without accompaniment, to very basic melodies. This was known as exclusive psalmody. Examples of this may still be found in various places, including in some of the Presbyterian churches of western Scotland.\nThe other Reformation approach, the normative principle of worship, produced a burst of hymn writing and congregational singing. Martin Luther is notable not only as a reformer, but as the author of many hymns including \"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\" (\"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\"), which is sung today even by Catholics, and \"Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ\" (\"Praise be to You, Jesus Christ\") for Christmas. Luther and his followers often used their hymns, or chorales, to teach tenets of the faith to worshipers. The first Protestant hymnal was published in Bohemia in 1532 by the Unitas Fratrum. Count Zinzendorf, the Lutheran leader of the Moravian Church in the 18th century wrote some 2,000 hymns. The earlier English writers tended to paraphrase biblical texts, particularly Psalms; Isaac Watts followed this tradition, but is also credited as having written the first English hymn which was not a direct paraphrase of Scripture.\nWatts (1674–1748), whose father was an Elder of a dissenter congregation, complained at age 16, that when allowed only psalms to sing, the faithful could not even sing about their Lord, Christ Jesus. His father invited him to see what he could do about it; the result was Watts' first hymn, \"Behold the glories of the Lamb\".\nFound in few hymnals today, the hymn has eight stanzas in common meter and is based on Revelation 5:6, 8, 9, 10, 12.\n\nRelying heavily on Scripture, Watts wrote metered texts based on New Testament passages that brought the Christian faith into the songs of the church. Isaac Watts has been called \"the father of English hymnody\", but Erik Routley sees him more as \"the liberator of English hymnody\", because his hymns, and hymns like them, moved worshipers beyond singing only Old Testament psalms, inspiring congregations and revitalizing worship.\n\nLater writers took even more freedom, some even including allegory and metaphor in their texts.\n\nCharles Wesley's hymns spread Methodist theology, not only within Methodism, but in most Protestant churches. He developed a new focus: expressing one's personal feelings in the relationship with God as well as the simple worship seen in older hymns. Wesley wrote:\n\nWesley's contribution, along with the Second Great Awakening in America led to a new style called gospel, and a new explosion of sacred music writing with Fanny Crosby, Lina Sandell, Philip Bliss, Ira D. Sankey, and others who produced testimonial music for revivals, camp meetings, and evangelistic crusades. The tune style or form is technically designated \"gospel songs\" as distinct from hymns. Gospel songs generally include a refrain (or chorus) and usually (though not always) a faster tempo than the hymns. As examples of the distinction, \"Amazing Grace\" is a hymn (no refrain), but \"How Great Thou Art\" is a gospel song. During the 19th century, the gospel-song genre spread rapidly in Protestantism and to a lesser but still definite extent, in Roman Catholicism; the gospel-song genre is unknown in the worship \"per se\" by Eastern Orthodox churches, which rely exclusively on traditional chants (a type of hymn).\n\nThe Methodist Revival of the 18th century created an explosion of hymn-writing in Welsh, which continued into the first half of the 19th century. The most prominent names among Welsh hymn-writers are William Williams Pantycelyn and Ann Griffiths. The second half of the 19th century witnessed an explosion of hymn tune composition and congregational four-part singing in Wales.\n\nAlong with the more classical sacred music of composers ranging from Mozart to Monteverdi, the Catholic Church continued to produce many popular hymns such as Lead, Kindly Light, Silent Night, O Sacrament Divine and Faith of our Fathers.\n\nMany churches today use contemporary worship music which includes a range of styles often influenced by popular music. This often leads to some conflict between older and younger congregants (see contemporary worship). This is not new; the Christian pop music style began in the late 1960s and became very popular during the 1970s, as young hymnists sought ways in which to make the music of their religion relevant for their generation.\n\nThis long tradition has resulted in a wide variety of hymns. Some modern churches include within hymnody the traditional hymn (usually describing God), contemporary worship music (often directed to God) and gospel music (expressions of one's personal experience of God). This distinction is not perfectly clear; and purists remove the second two types from the classification as hymns. It is a matter of debate, even sometimes within a single congregation, often between revivalist and traditionalist movements.\n\nAfrican-Americans developed a rich hymnody from spirituals during times of slavery to the modern, lively black gospel style. The first influences of African American Culture into hymns came from Slave Songs of the United States a collection of slave hymns compiled by William Francis Allen who had difficulty pinning them down from the oral tradition, and though he succeeded, he points out the awe inspiring effect of the hymns when sung in by their originators.\n\nHymn writing, composition, performance and the publishing of Christian hymnals were prolific in the 19th-century and were often linked to the abolitionist movement by many hymn writers. Surprisingly, Stephen Foster wrote a number of hymns that were used during church services during this era of publishing.\n\nThomas Symmes spread throughout churches a new idea of how to sing hymns, in which anyone could sing a hymn any way they felt led to; this idea was opposed by the views of Symmes' colleagues who felt it was \"like Five Hundred different Tunes roared out at the same time\". William Billings, a singing school teacher, created the first tune book with only American born compositions. Within his books, Billings did not put as much emphasis on \"common measure\" which was the typical way hymns were sung, but he attempted \"to have a Sufficiency in each measure\". Boston's Handel and Haydn Society aimed at raising the level of church music in America, publishing their \"Collection of Church Music\". In the late 19th century Ira D. Sankey and Dwight L. Moody developed the relatively new subcategory of gospel hymns.\n\nEarlier in the 19th century, the use of musical notation, especially shape notes, exploded in America, and professional singing masters went from town to town teaching the population how to sing from sight, instead of the more common lining out that had been used before that. During this period hundreds of tune books were published, including B.F. White's \"Sacred Harp\", and earlier works like the \"Missouri Harmony\", \"Kentucky Harmony\", \"Hesperian Harp\", D.H. Mansfield's \"The American Vocalist\", \"The Social Harp\", the \"Southern Harmony\", William Walker's \"Christian Harmony\", Jeremiah Ingalls' \"Christian Harmony\", and literally many dozens of others. Shape notes were important in the spread of (then) more modern singing styles, with tenor-led 4-part harmony (based on older English West Gallery music), fuging sections, anthems and other more complex features. During this period, hymns were incredibly popular in the United States, and one or more of the above-mentioned tunebooks could be found in almost every household. It isn't uncommon to hear accounts of young people and teenagers gathering together to spend an afternoon singing hymns and anthems from tune books, which was considered great fun, and there are surviving accounts of Abraham Lincoln and his sweetheart singing together from the \"Missouri Harmony\" during his youth. \n\nBy the 1860s musical reformers like Lowell Mason (the so-called \"better music boys\") were actively campaigning for the introduction of more \"refined\" and modern singing styles, and eventually these American tune books were replaced in many churches, starting in the Northeast and urban areas, and spreading out into the countryside as people adopted the gentler, more soothing tones of Victorian hymnody, and even adopted dedicated, trained choirs to do their church's singing, rather than having the entire congregation participate. But in many rural areas the old traditions lived on, not in churches, but in weekly, monthly or annual conventions were people would meet to sing from their favorite tunebooks. The most popular one, and the only one that survived continuously in print, was the \"Sacred Harp\", which could be found in the typical rural Southern home right up until the living tradition was \"re-discovered\" by Alan Lomax in the 1960s (although it had been well-documented by musicologist George Pullen Jackson prior to this). Indeed, \"the most common book on . Since then there has been a renaissance in \"Sacred Harp singing\", with annual conventions popping up in all 50 states and in a number of European countries recently, including the UK, Germany, Ireland and Poland, as well as in Australia. Today \"Sacred Harp singing\" is a vibrant and living tradition with thousands of enthusiastic participants all around the globe, drawn to the democratic principles of the tradition and exotic, beautiful sound of the music. Although the lyrics tend to be highly religious in nature, the tradition is largely secular, and participation if open to all who care to attend.\n\nThe meter indicates the number of syllables for the lines in each stanza of a hymn. This provides a means of marrying the hymn's text with an appropriate hymn tune for singing. In practice many hymns conform to one of a relatively small number of meters (syllable count and stress patterns). Care must be taken, however, to ensure that not only the metre of words and tune match, but also the stresses on the words in each line. Technically speaking an iambic tune, for instance, cannot be used with words of, say, trochaic metre.\n\nThe meter is often denoted by a row of figures besides the name of the tune, such as \"87.87.87\", which would inform the reader that each verse has six lines, and that the first line has eight syllables, the second has seven, the third line eight, etc. The meter can also be described by initials; L.M. indicates long meter, which is 88.88 (four lines, each eight syllables long); S.M. is short meter (66.86); C.M. is common metre (86.86), while D.L.M., D.S.M. and D.C.M. (the \"D\" stands for double) are similar to their respective single meters except that they have eight lines in a verse instead of four.\n\nAlso, if the number of syllables in one verse differ from another verse in the same hymn (e.g., the hymn \"I Sing a Song of the Saints of God\"), the meter is called Irregular.\n\nThe Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji ( ), is a collection of hymns (Shabad) or \"Gurbani\" describing the qualities of God and why one should meditate on God's name. The \"Guru Granth Sahib\" is divided by their musical setting in different ragas into fourteen hundred and thirty pages known as \"Angs\" (limbs) in Sikh tradition. Guru Gobind Singh (1666–1708), the tenth guru, after adding Guru Tegh Bahadur's bani to the Adi Granth affirmed the sacred text as his successor, elevating it to \"Guru Granth Sahib\". The text remains the holy scripture of the Sikhs, regarded as the teachings of the Ten Gurus. The role of Guru Granth Sahib, as a source or guide of prayer, is pivotal in Sikh worship.\n\n\n\nThe links below are restricted to either material that is historical or resources that are non-denominational or inter-denominational.

Such inaccurate stereotypes are likely to have a negative impact on the attractiveness of librarianship as a profession to young people.\n\nIn modern times, the archetype of the \"sexy librarian\" has also begun to gain some traction, introduced in an effort to subvert the popular matriarchal image and make them more appealing to the average consumer. Both archetypes boil down to a similar idea, however – an authoritative, implacable guardian of the books who, through either power or sex appeal, keep the library patrons in fear and thus maintain themselves as exclusive guardians of the otherwise obscure organization system in the library.\n\nChildren's literature offers a generally positive portrayal of librarians as knowledgeable, helpful, amazing and friendly, becoming more positive over the course of the 20th century. Adult literature, however, portrays the profession more negatively. Between these, portrayals of librarians in young adult fiction are neutral to negative. Here librarians are predominantly female, middle-aged, usually unattractive in some way, and mostly unmarried. Personality is mixed between positive traits such as intelligence, likeability, and kind-heartedness; and negative traits such as strictness, timidity, excess fastidiousness, and eccentricity. While some provide assistance to the main characters, several are the villains of the story. Duties generally include reference, but may only show clerical tasks; however the amount of technology used by librarian characters has increased over time.\n\nA disproportionate number of the librarians represented in novels are in the detective fiction genre, frequently as an amateur detective and protagonist. Although the stereotype of the librarian as \"passive bore\" does not seem reconcilable with the intensity of a mystery, the stereotypical librarian does share many traits with the successful detective. Their mindset is focused, calm, unbiased in considering viewpoints, and focused on the world around them. By personality they are industrious perfectionists—and eccentric. The drab and innocuous look of the stereotypical librarian is perfect for avoiding suspicion, while their research skills and ability to ask the right questions allow them to procure and evaluate the information necessary to solve the case. The knowledge they have gained from wide reading successfully competes with a private investigator's personal experience. For example, Jacqueline Kirby is drawn into the mystery in Elizabeth Peters' novel \"The Seventh Sinner\" (1972) due to her awareness of her surroundings. Wearing the stereotypical bun, glasses, and practical clothes, together with an eccentrically large purse, she is self-possessed and resourceful, knowledgeable in a variety of fields and skilled at research.\n\nPapers on librarians in popular culture have also analyzed:\n\nIn the Sune series, Sune's mother Karin is a librarian who does not like comic books, a reference to the comic book debates of earlier decades.\n\nOther appearances of fictional librarians in literature include:\nAshanti White, author of the 2012 book, \"Not Your Ordinary Librarian: Debunking the Popular Perceptions of Librarians\", wrote that the shushing buttoned-down, older librarian was the most common depiction of librarians, in fiction, followed by the sexy librarian] stereotype.Ramirose Ilene Attebury, in \"Library Philosophy and Practice\" reported she found that the sexy librarian stereotype was more popular than the old maid stereotype, in YouTube videos.\n\nAccording to Ann Seidl, director of the documentary \"The Hollywood Librarian\", librarians in film are often portrayed as meek, timid, and unassertive in nature. After indexing hundreds of appearances of librarians in film, she found that \"the shorter the reference to a librarian in a film, the worse the stereotype.\"\n\nBy the 1950s, movies had established the stereotype of librarians as \"spinsters\" and \"eggheads\". Thus, female movie librarians are usually unmarried, prim, and introverted. They are usually young and may be attractive, but dress drably and are sexually repressed. The \"fate-worse-than-death view of librarians\" is particularly evident in movies such as \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"The Music Man\".\n\nMale movie librarians – mild, intelligent, and timid – have fewer and less important roles.\n\nSeidl's documentary discusses such stereotypes as:\n\nin contrast with such more well-rounded characters as:\n\nIn 1994's live-action animated film \"The Pagemaster\", frightened and pessimistic Richard Tyler (Macaulay Culkin) is sent on an errand by his parents but ends up caught in a thunderstorm. He takes shelter in a library, where he meets an eccentric librarian, Mr. Dewey (Christopher Lloyd), who encourages Richard to get a library card, despite Richard's protests that he doesn't want a book while he waits out the storm. Mr. Dewey tells Richard that a library card is a \"passport to the wonderful and quite unpredictable world of books.\"\n\nWhile Richard looks for a phone, he accidentally falls. When he awakens, the library art around him is melting and overtakes him - turning everything into animated illustrations. Richard befriends three books and has to overcome obstacles from classic literature to get back to his real life. At the end of the film, Mr. Dewey \"bends the rules\" and allows Richard to check out all three books (even though the library has a borrow policy of only two books). Mr. Dewey also smiles to Richard as he leaves, hinting that Mr. Dewey is actually the Pagemaster and none of the adventure was a dream. Mr. Dewey introduced Richard to the adventures possible in libraries and books as he \"knows just how magical of a place a library can be.\"\n\nLibrarians are usually ordinary people caught up in circumstances, rather than being heroes; likewise they are rarely villainous although they may have flaws, such as racism in \"Goodbye, Columbus\".\n\nOther movie appearances of librarians noted in the literature include:\n\nIn \"Only Two Can Play\" Peter Sellers plays the role of a poorly paid and professionally frustrated Welsh librarian and occasional drama critic, whose affections fluctuate between glamorous Liz and his long-suffering wife Jean.\n\nThe 1999 movie\"The Mummy\" has a main character, Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) who is a librarian. The character is awesomely clumsy and later moves away from her profession in the sequels. But a memorable quote from her, upon introduction to the other main character shows a more positive depiction of librarians:Evelyn: \"Look, I... I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure-seeker, or a gunfighter, Mr. O'Connell, but I am proud of what I am.\"Rick: \"And what is that?\"Evelyn: \"I... am a librarian.\"In the Disney/Pixar's 2013 film Monsters University, Alison Nastasi of Flavorwire says the university librarian \"isn’t fond of noise and doesn’t think twice about tossing rowdy students out the window into a pond below\".\n\nThe television series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1997-2003) featured the character of Rupert Giles as school librarian at Sunnydale High and mentor for the main character of Buffy. At the start of the series Giles is often portrayed stereotypically, for example he wears old-fashioned clothes and spectacles, is intelligent and well-read though has a dislike for computers, and is overly concerned with following regulations. As the series progresses the character is given the opportunity to develop beyond these stereotypes as we learn that Giles was a rebellious and angry teenager who was partly responsible for the death of a friend after dabbling in dark magic. He is also depicted at being competent with weaponry and hand-to-hand combat and at playing the guitar and singing. Though Giles never has a long-lasting on-screen relationship and has never been married, he does have brief romances on screen and is acknowledged as an attractive man by other characters in the show; therefore at least partially refuting the usual stereotype.\n\nFrom 2004-2008, the John Rogers fantasty-adventure television film franchise, \"The Librarian\", aired on TNT. The three films focus on a librarian (portrayed by Noah Wyle) who protects secret artifacts in the Metropolitan Public Library in New York.\n\nThe film franchise led to the television series \"The Librarians\" which began airing in 2014 on TNT. It follows a new team of librarians who solve mysteries, recover powerful artifacts, and fight against supernatural threats.\n\nIn the 2009 \"Ron and Tammy\" episode of the NBC comedy series \"Parks and Recreation\", Leslie Knope's dreams of a local park are almost squashed by Tammy, the new library director at the Pawnee Public Library and Ron Swanson's ex-wife. Tammy places a claim for the lot that Leslie intended to use for her park. Tammy then tries to sexually manipulate Ron into giving her the lot for the library. Leslie calls librarians \"diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats\" as well as \"punk-ass book jockeys.\" In \"\", Leslie says Tammy is \"just a manipulative, psychotic, library book-peddling, sex-crazed, she-demon.\" Tammy also has books on \"Approved\" and \"Rejected\" shelves, which insinuate that the library operates in a biased manner. The depictions of the library on \"Parks and Recreation\" \"illuminate the nature of library anxiety.\"\n\nActress Christi Waldon appeared in season two of \"Stranger Things\" as \"Marissa\", the librarian of the Hawkins Public Library. The episodes she appeared in were season one episode three, \"Holly, Jolly\", and season two episode three, \"The Pollywog\".\n\nIn season two episode six of \"\" entitled \"Caged\", actor Michael A. Goorjian plays Aaron Pratt, an autistic librarian who witnesses the death of a colleague. Aaron states that he has \"a masters in library science and an English Degree from UNLV.\"\n\nThe PBS puppet series \"Between the Lions\" promotes early reading to little children. Theo and Cleo Lion are the librarians.\n\nIn creating the Australian miniseries \"The Librarians\", co-producers and -writers Wayne Hope and Robyn Butler consulted with real librarians for research, and took their advice to avoid shushing and cardigan-wearing librarian characters.\n\nIn currently running SyFy show \"The Magicians\" (based on the series by Lev Grossman), the Library of the Neitherlands is an archive that contains all of the knowledge in the universe. Librarians formed the Order of the Librarians, a group that protects that knowledge. The Library is staffed by Zelda Schiff, a prim, glasses-and-cardigan wearing librarian whose biggest concern is possible defacement of library books.\n\nthe Librarian was in 1993 Stop-motion Episode of \"The Dreamstone\", is voiced by Richard Griffiths\n\n\nThere have been several characters associated with the library field in the realm of interactive entertainment, often portrayed as guides and/or purveyors of knowledge who help the user progress within the game.\n\n\"\", a PC game from 1991, features a notably large library, complete with a female librarian who wheels around in her chair between shelves and shushes the protagonist.\n\nIn 2006 Microsoft introduced an early version of what was to become the bing search engine that used over 600 pre-recorded video clips of actor Janina Gavankar, portraying the character of \"Ms Dewey\", described as a sexy librarian character.\n\nStardew Valley, an indie role-playing game released in 2016, features a town Library and Museum, staffed by Gunther, the museum curator. The Library and Museum is empty at the beginning of the game and Gunther asks players to help fill it by donating artifacts and minerals and finding the library's lost books.\n\nIn 2003, Archie McPhee brought out a librarian action figure, modeled on Seattle Public Library librarian Nancy Pearl. 28,000 action figures were sold in the first week of their availability. Wearing a suit, bun and glasses, the action figure sparked controversy, particularly for the button-triggered shushing motion. Many librarians took it in a light-hearted spirit, while others felt it perpetuated negative stereotypes. The original version of the action figure was discontinued, but Archie McPhee now sells a super-hero version of Nancy Pearl with a \"removable cape and a deep understanding of how knowledge is organized.\"\n\n\n"}

Actors Robert Sean Leonard, Frank Whaley, and Steve Zahn joined the fledgling enterprise, which Hawke named after an obscure novel. Leonard later explained, \"We would be sitting around New York a lot, and we bowled a lot, and eventually we thought, 'When we're not doing anything, why don't we see if we can put some new plays on?'\"\n\nMalaparte's first production was a new translation of Luigi Pirandello's 1918 play \"\" starring Hamilton, Hawke, Sherman, Cynthia Nixon, and Austin Pendleton, which ran from October 9–31, 1992. The company operated for three seasons in the 1990s as the members juggled film and television work; there were often disputes over fundraising, casting, and play selection. Shows were performed in rented venues throughout Manhattan, with a flat $10 ticket price. In 1992, Jason Blum joined Malaparte as producing director and personally hawked fliers in Times Square, shouting, \"Don't go see some Broadway show! Come see a new play by an American playwright!\" \"The New Yorker\" critic Hilton Als wrote that the Malaparte collective \"brought a new take on male anxiety to the American theatre, and was not embarrassed by its love of women, or its romanticism.\"\n\nMalaparte officially dissolved in 2000, in part because the members wanted to devote more time to their children. In 2005, Hawke referred to the company's heyday as \"pretty much the most thrilling period of my life\". \n"}
{"id": "8987018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8987018", "title": "Midrash HaGadol", "text": "Midrash HaGadol\n\nMidrash HaGadol or The Great Midrash (Hebrew: מדרש הגדול) was written by Rabbi David Adani of Yemen (14th century) compilation of aggadic midrashim on the Pentateuch taken from the two Talmuds and earlier Midrashim of Yemenite provenance. In addition, it borrows quotations from the Targums, and Maimonides and Kabbalistic writings , and in this aspect is unique among the various midrashic collections. This important work—the largest of the midrashic collections—came to popular attention only relatively recently (late 19th century) through the efforts of Jacob Saphir, Solomon Schecter, and David Zvi Hoffman. In addition to containing midrashic material that is not found elsewhere, such as the \"Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai\", the Midrash HaGadol contains what are considered to be more correct versions of previously known Talmudic and Midrashic passages.\n\nThe existence of the \"Midrash HaGadol\" was first brought to the attention of Jewish scholarship by Jacob Sapir, who in his \"Even Sapir\" (1866) reports seeing a manuscript of the work in the possession of the Chief Rabbi of Yemen . His remarks about the \"discovery\" are reproduced in , where he describes a work on the entire Pentateuch containing \"twice as much as our Midrash Rabbah\". (It is worth noting that while this collection was new to European Jewry, it was probably well known to the Jews of Yemen.) The first manuscript was brought from Yemen to Jerusalem and then to Berlin in 1878 by a certain Mr. Shapira, and this Midrash subsequently became the subject of much scholarly attention. There are currently approximately two hundred manuscripts of this work residing in various public and private Hebraica collections, according to the catalog of the \"Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts\".\n\nThe \"Midrash HaGadol\" on Genesis was first published by Solomon Schecter in 1902. A large portion of \"Midrash HaGadol\" on Exodus was then published by David Zvi Hoffman in 1913. \"Midrash HaGadol\" on Book of Numbers was published by S. Fisch in 1940 in a more accessible style than the previous efforts, which were principally arranged for a scholarly audience. More recent editions listed by are those on Genesis and Exodus by M. Margulies (1967), on Leviticus by E.N. Rabinowitz (1932) and A. Steinsalz (1975), on Numbers by E.N. Rabinowitz (1973), and on Deuteronomy by S. Fish (1972). The Mossad HaRav Kook Institute in Jerusalem has also published a five-volume edition.\n\nAccording to , the work dates to the late 14th century. A discussion of its authorship is provided in , wherein he reviews the evidence in favor of the three then-prevailing opinions regarding authorship of the Midrash HaGadol, variously that it is the work of Rambam, his son Abraham ben Rambam, the author according to Maharitz (an opinion disputed in later generations), or David bar Amram al-Adeni. After discounting Rambam as a possible author, and reviewing some compelling factors in favor of the other two possible authors, offers the conciliatory hypothesis that the work was composed in the Arabic language by Abraham ben Rambam, and translated into Hebrew by David al-Adeni. While Dr. Fish offers possible explanations for how the work—if indeed authored by Abraham ben Rambam in Egypt—came first to be \"lost\" and then to be rediscovered in Yemen, find the attribution to Abraham ben Rambam \"only extremely weakly attested,\" and report that modern scholars almost uniformly attribute the work in its entirety to David bar Amram al-Adeni. S. Fish concedes this as well in his Encyclopedia Judaica article on the topic.\n\nThe \"Midrash HaGadol\" contains material from Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon, Sifre Zutta, Mekhilta on Deuteronomy, Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael, Sifre, and other unknown midrashic sources. In addition, the midrash makes use of the work of Rambam and Alfasi, as well as many geonic writings , but the sources are never cited—a unique characteristic of this midrash . All these various sources are fused in such a way that the product is a new literary creation in which the original ingredients can frequently not be unambiguously discriminated.\n\nA \"Midrash HaGadol that was brought from Aden\" is cited by Joseph Shalit Riqueti in \"Sefer Chochmat HaMishkan\" (1676), but it is not known whether this is the same as the work under consideration here.\n\n\n"}

Its largest program is Reel Affirmations, the third largest LGBT film festival (in terms of attendance) in the United States and the largest all-volunteer film festival in the world.\n\nOne In Ten is overseen by a board of three officers and nine board members. A full-time, paid executive director oversees the day-to-day operations of the organization. All One In Ten programs, including Reel Affirmations, are conceived, organized and implemented by volunteers.\n\nOne In Ten was co-founded by Barry Becker, Mark Betchkal, Matthew Cibellis and Keith Clark, gay residents of Washington, D.C. The four began meeting in 1990, and founded One In Ten as the parent organization for Reel Affirmations. The four sought the advice and input of Frameline, then the largest LGBT gay film festival in the U.S. With financial and administrative assistance from Frameline, the first Reel Affirmations film festival opened on October 11, 1991.\n\nIn 1995, One In Ten assumed responsibility for organizing Washington, D.C.'s Gay Pride Day events after the festival's original sponsoring organization nearly went bankrupt. One In Ten moved the street festival from Francis Junior High to Freedom Plaza near the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue N.W. The organization also changed the festival's parade route. Instead of traveling south from Meridian Hill Park and then westward on P Street N.W. to finish at Francis Junior High School, the parade now began at the school, moved east along P Street N.W. to 14th Street N.W., and then south on 14th Street to Freedom Plaza.\n\nHowever, the financial and organizational strain of producing the event proved too heavy for the arts group. In 1997, Whitman-Walker Clinic joined One In Ten as a co-sponsor of the festival, and the event was renamed Capital Pride. The street festival was moved off Freedom Plaza and onto Pennsylvania Avenue N.W. between 14th and 10th Streets N.W. Corporate sponsorships also rose dramatically, reflecting the festival's growing commercial nature. Corporate sponsorships reached $247,000 in 1999, up from $80,000 in 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Whitman-Walker Clinic became the sole co-sponsor of Capital Pride, although One In Ten continued to serve on the festival's community board along with other organizations.\n\n\n\n"}

She was one of the first female American composers to have a recording devoted to her symphonic works, and the first American composer (male or female) to have a concert devoted entirely to her works presented in the Soviet Union. Although she does not quote particular melodies, her compositional style is accessible and influenced by American folk and popular idioms; her success at creating a distinctly American musical voice places her among such figures as Charles Ives, Aaron Copland and George Gershwin.\n\nPeggy Stuart was born in Swampscott, Massachusetts. She started piano lessons at age five, wrote her first song at age nine, and later studied with Heinrich Gebhard (a pupil of Teodor Leszetycki and teacher of Leonard Bernstein), privately with Raymond Robinson, and at the New England Conservatory with Quincy Porter. She originally planned to be a concert pianist, and her early mature works are all for piano.\n\nIn 1937, she wrote a ballet \"Cracked Ice\", for the Boston Skating Club. This was the first ballet ever composed specifically for ice skating. The work was scored, at her request, by Ferde Grofé, who conducted it at Madison Square Garden; it was also played by the Boston Pops Orchestra under Arthur Fiedler. Stuart then studied orchestration. Her orchestral scores \"Night Froth\", \"The Island\" (sinfonietta), \"Smoke Drift\" and \"Twilight City\" (piano and orchestra) were all premiered by the Boston Pops.\n\nDuring World War II, she was involved in a housing bureau for servicemen stationed in Boston, and often played for hospitalised soldiers. She conducted an all-woman ensemble, and was pianist and assistant conductor of the Women's Symphony of Boston. She founded the Junior League Orchestra in Boston and conducted it for seven years. After the war she moved to New York City, and started a research project in music psychotherapy at a mental institution.\n\nIn 1952 she married Joseph R. Coolidge, a freelance writer from Boston. Together they wrote a number of children's stories with Peggy's background music, and other songs in traditional folk style. She wrote her only film score for \"The Silken Affair\", starring David Niven, in 1956. She wrote incidental music for a New York production of Seán O'Casey's \"Red Roses for Me\", and the music was later reworked as the orchestral suite \"Dublin Town\". In 1963 and 1965, she was invited to Vienna, Budapest, Warsaw and Moscow for performances of her works, also sometimes appearing as piano soloist. She and Joseph met Aram Khachaturian and his wife Nina Makarova, becoming close friends. A ballet \"An Evening in New York\" was written on her return to the United States.\n\n\"Rhapsody for Harp and Orchestra\" was written in 1965. In 1967 her works were played in Tokyo in a concert of American music, and she was received by Emperor Hirohito's brother, Prince Mikasa. In 1969 Peggy Stuart Coolidge wrote \"Spirituals in Sunshine and Shadow\", an orchestral work inspired by African-American blues and spirituals.\n\nIn 1970 she wrote \"Pioneer Dances\", inspired by the 19th century settlers of America. This was the only American work played at a 1975 Carnegie Hall concert to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Norwegian immigration to the United States.\n\nIn 1970 also, at Khachaturian's instigation, she became the first American composer to have a concert devoted entirely to her works presented in the Soviet Union. She was awarded the medal of the Soviet Union of Workers in Art on this occasion. Her name started to become better known, and she was featured in concerts in Western Europe and East Berlin.\n\nIn 1971, at the request of the World Wildlife Fund, she composed a three-minute theme to complement the fund's visual symbol of a giant panda on a green field. The theme became the basis for a ten-minute orchestral work with narration written by her husband, called \"Blue Planet\". That year also saw \"New England Autumn\", a two-movement suite for chamber orchestra.\n\nIn 1975, the Westphalian Symphony Orchestra conducted by Siegfried Landau recorded one of the first LPs ever devoted to the works of a single American female composer. The works were the \"Rhapsody for Harp and Orchestra\" (with soloist Aristid von Würtzler), \"New England Autumn\", \"Pioneer Dances\", and \"Spirituals in Sunshine and Shadow\".\n\nShe later wrote a song cycle to words by American poets, to honour the art patron Isabella Stewart Gardner, her husband's great-aunt. \"American Mosaic\" was written in 1978 on a commission by the American Wind Symphony.\n\nPeggy Stuart Coolidge died of cancer in Cushing, Maine. Her musical scores are held at the Harvard University Library.\n\nMany of her premieres took place in Europe, and she is better known overseas than she is in her own country. However, she is one of the few 20th century American women composers whose works were performed and recorded.\n\nIn addition to the works mentioned above, Peggy Stuart Coolidge wrote:\n"}
{"id": "3918551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3918551", "title": "Presentationism", "text": "Presentationism\n\nPresentationism (from Latin \"prae-esse\", \"praesens\", present) is a philosophical term used in various senses deriving from the general sense of the term \"presentation\".\n\nAccording to G. F. Stout (cf. \"Manual of Psychology\", i. 57), presentations are whatever constituents or our total experience at any moment directly determine the nature of the object as it is perceived or thought of at that moment. In Baldwin's \"Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology\", vol. ii., a presentation is an object in the special form under which it is cognized at any given moment of perceptual or ideational process. This, the widest definition of the term, due largely to Professor James Ward, thus includes both perceptual and ideational processes. The term has, indeed, been narrowed so as to include ideation, the correlative representation being utilized for ideal presentation, but in general the wider use is preferred.\n\nWhen the mind is cognizing an object, the object presents itself to the senses or to thought in one of a number of different forms (e.g. a picture is a work of art, a saleable commodity, a representation of a house, etc.). Presentation is thus essentially a cognitive process. Hence the most important use of the term presentationism, which is defined by Ward, in \"Mind\", N.S. (1893), ii. 58, as a doctrine the gist of which is that all the elements of psychical life are primarily and ultimately cognitive elements. This use takes precedence of two others: (1) that of Hamilton, for presentative as opposed to representative theories of knowledge, and (2) that of some later writers who took it as equivalent to phenomenon. Ward traces the doctrine in his sense to David Hume, to whom the mind is a kind of theatre in which perceptions appear and vanish continually (see Green and Grose edition of \"A Treatise of Human Nature\", p. 534). The main problem is as to whether psychic activity is presented or not. Ward holds that it is not presented or presentable save indirectly.\n"}

Prompts are mouthed silently or hurled lyrically in a half-voice, audible (hopefully) only on stage. (This is in contrast to the prompter in a theatre who aids actors who have forgotten their words or lines.)\n\nOpera prompters are traditionally housed in a stuffy wooden box at the center-front edge of the stage, above the orchestra pit. They are visible to the performers and no one else. Technology has brought cool air and small display screens, among other advances, to support their work.\n\nEffective prompting can be a challenge. The American prompter Philip Eisenberg recounts the story at a Maria Callas performance when she needed louder prompts. The famed diva swooped down in a curtsy right in front of the prompter’s box and — mid-curtsy, unnoticed by the audience — gave the Italian command \"più forte!\" (louder) to her boxed colleague.\n\nPrompters attend all rehearsals, mark up any adjustments or clarifications to the score, and generally \"prepare\" singers for a role. Their profile is low, and opera program books often credit them only under \"musical preparation\" or some similar moniker.\n"}
{"id": "8159785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8159785", "title": "Public Netbase", "text": "Public Netbase\n\nPublic Netbase was a cultural media initiative, open access internet platform, and advocate for the development of electronic art. The project increasingly came into conflict with the Austrian political establishment during the 1990s. It received awards and recognition by UNESCO.\n\nPublic Netbase was founded by Konrad Becker and Francisco de Sousa Webber in Vienna's Messepalast (later renamed to Museumsquartier) in 1994 as a non-profit internet provider and a platform for the participatory use and critical analyses of information and communication technology. Its parent organization was the \"Institute for New Culture Technologies-t0\", founded in 1993. Most of the Institute's activities after 1994 occurred through Public Netbase, leading to the names and establishment dates being loosely applied, even in the organization's official material. The name of its World Wide Web server, \"t0\", was often appended to either name as well. During the first years of its existence, Public Netbase shared a space in Museumsquartier with the initiative \"Depot – Kunst und Diskussion\". After it relocated to own rooms (also in Museumsquartier), the number of wokshops and instruction courses increased and the program of discursive events was now realized on an almost daily basis.\n\nPublic Netbase focused on aiding the development of electronic art and the impact of the nascent World Wide Web on culture. Its own online presence earned it an award for distinction at the Prix Ars Electronica in 1995. Much of the web space provided through Public Netbase supported Austrian artists, although some hosted projects, such as the Transformation Story Archive, had wider recognition. The physical location in the Museumsquartier was also used for sponsored events, ranging from art symposia to a conference of the Association of Autonomous Astronauts to a \"lecture/performance/event\" by Critical Art Ensemble about biotechnology and a number of conferences/exhibitions such as ROBOTRONIKA (1998) and SYNWORLD (1999).\n\nWhen the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) and its leader Jörg Haider began to rise in power in Austria, Public Netbase took an increasingly political activist role while facing increasing government pressure. Haider accused Public Netbase of sponsoring child pornography and conflated Christina Göstl's hosted erotic art with a commercial porn site run from the British Virgin Islands during a speech in parliament. Meanwhile, Public Netbase sponsored a \"virtual alternative to Austria's far right government\" that offered Austrian Web Resistance Awards to web sites dedicated to opposing Haider's government.\n\nThe Institute for Applied Autonomy, recipient of an award for distinction in interactive art at the Prix Ars Electronica 2000, dedicated their award to Public Netbase for its political efforts. Another t0-project begun during this period, World-information.org, described as \"an ongoing effort to critically observe and investigate new technologies in a societal, economic and artistic context\" led to involvement with the UNESCO \"Digi-Arts\" program and a series of conventions across Europe.\n\nHowever, the organization's successes were insufficient to stave off problems. Its lease at the Museumsquartier was not renewed after the controversial remodelling period in 2000, and it faced a series of audits and other bureaucratic obstacles. Financial difficulties and an inability to secure a permanent replacement location could not be resolved. Despite significant community support and a reorganization effort in 2005 that shortened its name to Netbase, the City of Vienna stopped all funding effective January 11, 2006, leading to the immediate shut down of the organization.\n\nThe \"Institute for New Culture Technologies-t0\" is still active: Its projects are now mainly conducted through World-Information.Org and World-Information Institute. Since 2002 it has also been organizing Austria's most prominent online \"polling booth\" wahlkabine.at \n\nPublic Netbase organized conferences, exhibitions, websites on a regular basis. Information can be found in the book \"Public Netbase: Non Stop Future\" as well as in an activity report which was compiled in 2004 and is available online.\n\nBehind the rather dadaistic format of an 'intergalactic conference' that refers to an independent community based space program, one can find a critical discussion of the accessibility of new technologies and of current politics of space.\n\nThis series of events which took place in October 1997 critically analyzed topics related to surveillance and control in information societies.\n\nThis project questioning the \"bio-technological revolution\" was developed by the US-based artist collective Critical Art Ensemble in co-operation with Public Netbase. Visitors had the possibility to take actual screening tests for donor DNA and find out \"if they were considered 'fit' or 'unfit' for reproduction in a pan capitalist society.\" Amongst others, Let's Make Baby!, \"an illustrated guide for children that explains how science and medicine create life and why\", was available.\n\nIn the course of this co-operation with The Society of the Unknown (London) a freight container – installed in front of Vienna's opera house – was \"transformed into a psychogeographical feedback device\".\n\nIn this five-day event, which mainly consisted of a symposium and an exhibition, current developments in robotics and automatization were presented and critically analyzed.\n\nPeriod After was \"focusing on the long term development in the Balkan region, related to media, contemporary culture and the potential and real consequences of the ongoing crisis.\" Main part of the project and prerequisite for other activities was the development of a network of media initiatives in South Eastern Europe.\n\nSynworld was one of Public Netbase's most comprehensive events in the 1990s. It focused on relations between popular games and developments of scientific and social relevance. The multifaceted program included lectures, installations, multimedia presentations, game stations and a lounge.\n\nThis is one example out of a field of activities in which Public Netbase engaged continuously: fostering self-organization in the field of independent media initiatives in Austria in order to voice their interests and concerns, and to influence the development of cultural and media policies. Meetings were organized, lists of demands collectively formulated, and attempts werde made to raise awareness on a broader scale.\n\nEuropean Cultural Backbone was \"a coalition of mediacultural institutions and individuals working together to creatively use and develop participatory media for social change\".\n\nThis anti-racist project was conducted in a time when the Austrian federal government formed which for the first time included Jörg Haider's right-wing Freedom Party (FPÖ). The project took place in an underground station in Vienna and included, amongst others, Franz Xaver's media installation \"Fremdsteuerung\", several lectures as well as presentations of initiatives like Period After and the newly formed platform Get to Attack.\n\nThis website represented a discursive context that \"explicitly refused any dialogue with the ÖVP-FPÖ government and instead of that tried to develop its own identity\".\n\nThis website documented the political pressure which Austria's right-wing government exerted on Public Netbase, and the latter's resistance. free.netbase.org served also as a platform to organize and make visible the broad international solidarity with Public Netbase.\n\nInterface Explorer presented current trends in the design of new interfaces and web browsers. Projects by international artists were presented and a forum for the discussion of current trends was provided. The exhibition was co-curated by Johannes Grenzfurthner. One of the highlights was a lecture by Lev Manovich who had just published his book The Language of New Media.\n\nUnder this title, three installations in public space (inside and in front of Vienna's Museumsquartier) were installed, each presenting a media project: a virtual billboard in \"Remote Viewing\", the SMS project \"Text-FM\" and the music project \"Remote Jam\".\n\n\"Sound-politicization\" was one of the new terms which emerged in the course of the protests against the Austrian right-wing government. In free:re:public this belief in the political potential of sound was put into practice in the form of huge youth cultural protest demonstrations that were organized once a year in Vienna.\n\nThis strategic conference examined current relations between media politics, information technologies and political theories of democracy. Central questions for the conference were: \"Has the Internet still its original potential to foster a 'network democracy from below'? Aren't new media already too much compromised by the ever growing state and corporate influence? Can the Internet be reclaimed as a 'digital commons' or has the current crisis already reached a meta media level, beyond propaganda and its mirror counter-campaigns?\"\nPublic Netbase took part in this campaign launched by the \"European Digital Civil Right\" network and staged a protest at Vienna Airport. Passengers were informed that, as a consequence of a new EU directive, they were \"facing the risk of their personal data, including credit card number and religious affiliation, being transferred to the US authorities without their knowledge\".\n\nOpen Cultures comprised a two days conference, workshops and an exhibition. It focused on politics of the infosphere and on inventive approaches to advance a \"free flow of information\".\n\nA few days after the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) had taken place in Geneva, it was critically analyzed in two events organized by Public Netbase.\n\nThe Free Media Camp aimed at raising public awareness about the extremely precarious situation of independent and participatory media initiatives in Vienna. The camp was established in public space at Vienn\"s Karlsplatz and lasted for almost four months. In sum approximately 100 events (discussions, presentations, music events, screenings...) took place. The camp was organized by Public Netbase in co-operation with local cultural and media initiatives: Malmoe, IG Kultur Wien, Radio Orange 94.0 and Public Voice Lab.\n\nThis communication guerilla project, which was developed and conducted in co-operation with 0100101110101101.ORG, criticized the accelerating commercialization of public space. Faked announcements informed that Karlsplatz, one of Vienna's historical squares, was going to be renamed to \"Nikeplatz\" and that as part of this process a 36 meter high monument in form of the Nike-logo would be erected. A two-story glass pavilion located on the square informed about the alleged plans and served as a highly visible sign in public space. The project led to discussions in the arts and cultural scene. At the same time it was sufficiently plausible and spectacular to trigger various forms of citizens' protests and a broad media coverage.\n\nThis ant-racist project was developed in response to the aggravation of Austria's asylum policies as a consequence of the politics of the ÖVP-FPÖ government. Workshops were conducted in which young asylum seekers had the possibility to acquire and further develop media competencies.\n\nS-77CCR critically examined surveillance technologies and played with the idea of providing civil society with its own tools to observe and control public space. \"Top-down surveillance for grassroots initiatives!\" (Brian Holmes) \n\nAfter the artist and researcher Steve Kurtz, founding member of Critical Art Ensemble, had been arrested by the FBI and faced \"an indictment based on laws that severely curtail fundamental rights using the fight against terrorism as a pretext\", Public Netbase organized solidarity- and protest events in Vienna.\n\nFree Bitflows continued the format of major events combining conference, workshops and exhibition. It was an \"exploratory event focusing on the politics of info streams to advance free flows of information\".\n\nIn the year 2005 several Austrian anniversaries coincided: sixty years after the end of World War II, fifty years of Austrian State Treaty and 10 years of Austria's EU membership. 2005 was officially declared a 'jubilee year' and Public Netbase launched a \"range of political and cultural events [...] against the engines of jubilation, [that] will facilitate debates on the various jubilee topics from different emancipatory perspectives.\" The website \"Austria 2005: A protection kit against a year of homeland celebrations\" was a central space for these projects. Public Netbase's tradition of communication guerilla projects was continued in the four communiques of the \"Combat Resistance Cells\" \n\nThis communication guerilla project was developed in response to an anti-piracy campaign which was launched by the German film industry. Amongst others, a faked press conference was organized in Vienna's main shopping street: The launch of a similar anti-piracy campaign in Austria was announced and people accused of offenses like \"having sent copyrighted ringtones to a friend\" were provided to the pillory.\n\n\n"}

He wished this multicultural style to place no restrictions on instrumentation, and he said that he wanted no single country or culture to lay claim to it. Among ringbang's stylistic influences are calypso, reggae, soca, tuk, and zouk.\n\nGrant says that the word \"ringbang\" comes from vocalists scat singing \"Ringa-ringa-ringbang!\". He chose the word one day in 1993, while standing in recording engineer Frank Agarrat's backyard in Trinidad.\n\nIn an attempt to popularize ringbang music and its underlying philosophy, Grant asked various recording artists to apply the word (which he trademarked) to some of their songs. Barbadian recording artists Grynner, Square One, Viking Tundah, and others recorded ringbang tracks for Grant's record labels, Ice Records and Blue Wave Records. Among the ringbang albums on these labels were \"Fire in de Wave\" (1994), \"Ringbang Rebel Dance\" (1995), \"Ringbang Souljah\" (1996), and \"Ringbang Revolution\" (1997).\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1999, Grant hosted a concert on Tobago called Ringbang Celebration 2000, at which he performed with the Frontline Orchestra. The event drew approximately 11,000 people, and featured performances from artists from Antigua, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago. Calypso legend Lord Kitchener's brief appearance at the event was his final time onstage, as he died the following February.\n\nIn March 2003, Ice Records published \"Ringbang 4 Kids\", a selection of songs intended for children of primary school age. The songs were performed by Barbadian singer Indra Rudder, who had previously sung backing vocals for several Ice Records tracks.\n\n\n"}

The term derives from earlier terms of \"frounce\" or \"fronce\". A wavy effect is achieved without gathers or pleats by cutting a curved strip of fabric and applying the inner or shorter edge to the garment. The depth of the curve as well as the width of the fabric determines the depth of the flounce. A godet is a circle wedge that can be inserted into a flounce to further deepen the outer floating wave without adding additional bulk at the point of attachment to the body of the garment, such as at the hemline, collar or sleeve.\n\nRuffles appeared at the draw-string necklines of full chemises in the 15th century, evolved into the separately-constructed ruff of the 16th century.

It comes from the word in French for \"wake\" and can best be described as how a fragrance diffuses around the wearer. Sillage or diffusion in fragrances can also be called the \"projection\" of a fragrance.\n\nCompounds such as Hedione (methyl dihydrojasmonate) can be used to enhance the diffusivity of a fragrance. Hedione is a synthetic relative of methyl jasmonate, a naturally occurring compound in floral scents such as jasmine, tuberose and magnolia. Methyl jasmonate is also found in many other plant parts and is considered to be a signalling molecule. It is considered one of the compounds responsible for the projection of the scent in living flowers and was first fully characterised in between 1957 and 1962 in jasmine absolute (0.8%) by the fragrance chemist Edouard Demole who was working at Firmenich.\n\nThe first commercially successful fragrance to utilise Hedione was Eau Sauvage by perfumer Edmond Roudnitska for Christian Dior , launched in 1966. The addition of Hedione to a classically hesperidic fragrance construction created a dewy lemony magnolia-jasmine dimension without being directly floral, and gave it a new type of projection and transparency not experienced before in this type of perfume. This is considered to be the beginning of a new trend in perfumery towards transparency and projection.\n\nCompounds such as damascones, Iso-E super, linalool and some of the synthetic musks such as cashmeran may also be added to fragrances to enhance their diffusion and sillage.\n\nA fragrance does not need to be a heavy one to have a large sillage; fragrances such as Giorgio Beverly Hills for women and Poison (Dior) are very good examples of this. Eau Sauvage and L'eau d'Issey (Jaques Cavallier for Issey Miyake) have a large sillage but may be considered much lighter examples of this.\n\nSillage in a perfume could also be considered to be how a fragrance is perceived by others around the wearer and is enhanced by motion, ambient temperature as well as the inherent qualities of the skin. According to an article by Mookerjee, a fragrance is perceived by the diffusion of individual fragrance molecules. The rate of diffusion of these molecules in a fragrance however appears to be independent of their molecular weights, boiling points, odour thresholds and odour value.\n\nOnce a fragrance is applied to the skin, the skin itself becomes a substrate to the scent. The inherent scent of the individual skin, moisturisation of the skin, the behaviour of the microbiome of the skin, and the temperature of the surface of the skin that the fragrance is applied to will affect the sillage or diffusion of a perfume applied to it.\n"}

The theater was a stone building owned by the Venetian Tron family, and took its name from the neighbourhood where it was located, the parish of San Cassiano near the Rialto. It was considered 'public' as it was directed by an impresario, or general manager, for the paying public rather than for nobles exclusively.\n\nThe original theater, the first public theatre for spoken plays, was built in 1581. This structure succumbed to fire in 1629, and was soon after rebuilt by the owner, the Tron family.\n\nThe first operas of the commercially run venture were \"L'Andromeda\" and \"La Maga Fulminata\". These were produced in 1637 and 1638 respectively, by Romans Benedetto Ferrari and Francesco Manelli. Ferrari and company stayed until 1639 when the business was acquired by a new company managed by entrepreneur Francesco Caletti-Bruni, with financial backing from Venetian nobleman Cavalli. Caletti-Bruni composed most of the operas performed here in the six years from 1639 to 1645. After the 1650s the theater was surpassed by others, and its number of performances declined. Impresario Marco Faustini managed the Teatro San Cassiano from 1657 to 1660.\n\nTowards the end of the 17th century, Venice became the opera capital of the world as another ten opera houses had opened. At this point the Teatro San Cassiano could count first performances of 37 operas. The last performances were held in 1807 and it was demolished in 1812, mainly due to recurring fires. The operatic period \"dramma in musica\" coincided with the early years of the commercial San Cassiano and was influenced by its composers.\n\n\n"}

On September 21, 2003, he laid the cornerstone of the Temple for Peace in Normandy.\n\nOn 30 March 2012, at 3:24 in the morning Nepali time, Tenga Rinpoche died.\n\nNyima Döndrup, the yangsi (reincarnation) of the previous Tenga Rinpoche was born December 14, 2014 in Nepal. He was discovered in 2017 following the indications of the 17th Karmapa who met him on March 21, 2017 in Bodhgaya for a ceremony at Tergar Monastery.\n\n\n"}

One day the eldest son was told by his mother to fetch water for a cake, because it was time for him to seek his fortune, and the cake was all she could give him. The can was broken, the water he brought back little, and so the cake was small. The mother offered him all of it with her curse, or half with her blessing, and he took the whole. He left behind a knife, and said if the blade grew rusty, he was dead.\nHe met a shepherd, a swineherd, and a goatherd; each of the three told him the Red Ettin of Ireland had kidnapped the king of Scotland's daughter, but that he was not the man to rescue her. The shepherd also told him to be wary of the beasts he would meet next. They each had two heads, with four horns on each head, and the man fled them and hid in a castle.

{"id": "12993407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12993407", "title": "Vicky Jenson", "text": "Vicky Jenson\n\nVictoria \"Vicky\" Jenson (born 1960) is a film director of both live-action and animated films, and has been said to be \"one of Hollywood's most inspiring female Directors\". She has directed projects for DreamWorks Animation including \"Shrek\", the first film to win an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, giving rise to one of Hollywood's largest film franchises.\n\nJenson began painting animation cells at the age of 13. She attended the Academy of Art University in San Francisco and California State University Northridge. She \"started as a background artist at Hanna-Barbera in 1977, became a storyboard artist for Warner Bros., Marvel and Disney Television, and variously worked as a production designer, art director and co-producer\". In the early 1980s, Jenson worked on the storyboard backgrounds on the \"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" cartoon series for Filmation. She was also a design and color stylist on \"\", the influential Ralph Bakshi reboot of \"Mighty Mouse\", in the 1980s. She held the same position with \"The Ren & Stimpy Show\" in the early 1990s, for creator John Kricfalusi. For both \"Mighty Mouse\" and \"Ren & Stimpy\", Jenson was among those \"responsible for the development of the visual style\" of the series. In 1992, Jenson was the art director for \"\", and the production designer for \"\" and \"Playroom\". In 2000, Jenson began working for DreamWorks as a production designer and story artist for \"The Road to El Dorado\".\n\nHaving worked on \"The Road to El Dorado\" (2000) for DreamWorks, the studio initially hired Jenson to work on \"Shrek\" as a story artist, with the directors to be Andrew Adamson (also a first-time director) and Kelly Asbury, who had joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film \"\", and Jenson was selected by producer Jeffrey Katzenberg to be the new director of the film. Jenson recalled her experience being brought into \"Shrek\", and eventually tapped to direct, as follows:\n\nJenson described the directing process as one in which \"we didn't try to figure out how to make adolescents laugh. You have to use yourself as the best judge and use your own instincts. We figured if we laughed at it, chances are good someone else would too\". According to Adamson, the co-directors mutually decided to split the work in half, so the crew could at least know who to go to with specific questions about the film's sequences: \"We both ended up doing a lot of everything\", \"We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything.\" Following the success of \"Shrek\", Jenson went on to co-direct \"Shark Tale\" with Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman. In 2003, while working on \"Shark Tale\", Jenson received the first annual Kiera Chaplin Limelight award given at the Women's Image Network Awards.\n\nIn July 2017, it was reported that Jenson was directing an untitled animated fantasy film slated for release in 2019. The film tells of a teenager who \"comes of age using magical powers to defend her family when the opposing forces of light and darkness threaten to divide her kingdom.\"\n\nShe directed a live-action short, \"Family Tree\", which \"premiered at Sundance, screened at countless festivals, including Sundance, SXSW, Aspen and Malibu and went on to win multiple festival awards\". In 2009, she finished her first live-action feature directorial work for the Alexis Bledel-starring comedy, \"Post Grad\". The film received mixed reviews, but Roger Ebert awarded it three out of four stars, stating, \"[i]f you're cynical or jaded, it might not get past you. But here is the first movie in a long time that had me actually admitting I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel\". Also in 2009, Jenson directed all of the spots for the year-long \"Modelquins\" ad campaign for Old Navy, including the \"Supermodelquins Christmas\" ads. She was represented by the Anonymous Content agency for the campaign.\n\nIn 2015, Jenson directed a stage production of the play, \"Time Stands Still\", by Donald Margulies. The \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote of Jenson's stage directorial debut: \"the staging by Vicky Jenson successfully captures the script's broad contours\", and \"Broadway World\" praised the production, stating that \"Vicky Jenson smoothly directs her uniformly skilled four-member cast\".\n\nJenson is the sister of classical violinist Dylana Jenson.\n\n"}
{"id": "17599355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17599355", "title": "White", "text": "White\n\nWhite is the lightest color and is achromatic (having no hue). It is the color of fresh snow, chalk, and milk, and is the opposite of black. White objects fully reflect and scatter all the visible wavelengths of light. White on television and computer screens is created by a mixture of red, blue and green light.\n\nIn ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity. It was the royal color of the Kings of France, and of the monarchist movement that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922). Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble, and beginning in the 18th century, with the advent of neoclassical architecture, white became the most common color of new churches, capitols and other government buildings, especially in the United States. It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity and simplicity.\n\nAccording to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection, the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude. White is an important color for almost all world religions. The Pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, has worn white since 1566, as a symbol of purity and sacrifice. In Islam, and in the Shinto religion of Japan, it is worn by pilgrims. In Western cultures and in Japan, white is the most common color for wedding dresses, symbolizing purity and virginity. In many Asian cultures, white is also the color of mourning.\n\nThe word \"white\" continues Old English ', ultimately from a Common Germanic ' also reflected in OHG ', ON ', Goth. '. The root is ultimately from Proto-Indo-European language ', surviving also in Sanskrit ' \"to be white or bright\" and Slavonic ' \"light\". The Icelandic word for white, ', is directly derived from the Old Norse form of the word '. Common Germanic also had the word *\"blankaz\" (\"white, bright, blinding\"), borrowed into Late Latin as *\"blancus\", which provided the source for Romance words for \"white\" (Catalan, Occitan and French \"blanc\", Spanish \"blanco\", Italian \"bianco\", Galician-Portuguese \"branco\", etc.). The antonym of white is black.\n\nSome non-European languages have a wide variety of terms for white. The Inuit language has seven different words for seven different nuances of white. Sanskrit has specific words for bright white, the white of teeth, the white of sandalwood, the white of the autumn moon, the white of silver, the white of cow's milk, the white of pearls, the white of a ray of sunlight, and the white of stars. Japanese has six different words, depending upon brilliance or dullness, or if the color is inert or dynamic.\n\nWhite was one of the first colors used in art. The Lascaux Cave in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by paleolithic artists between 18,000 and 17,000 years ago. Paleolithic artists used calcite or chalk, sometimes as a background, sometimes as a highlight, along with charcoal and red and yellow ochre in their vivid cave paintings.\nIn ancient Egypt, white was connected with the goddess Isis. The priests and priestesses of Isis dressed only in white linen, and it was used to wrap mummies.\n\nIn Greece and other ancient civilizations, white was often associated with mother's milk. In Greek mythology, the chief god Zeus was nourished at the breast of the nymph Amalthea. In the Talmud, milk was one of four sacred substances, along with wine, honey, and the rose.\n\nThe ancient Greeks saw the world in terms of darkness and light, so white was a fundamental color. According to Pliny the Elder in his \"Natural History\", Apelles (4th century BC) and the other famous painters of ancient Greece used only four colors in their paintings; white, red, yellow and black; For painting, the Greeks used lead white, made by a long and laborious process.\n\nA plain white toga, known as a \"toga virilis\", was worn for ceremonial occasions by all Roman citizens over the age of 14–18. Magistrates and certain priests wore a \"toga praetexta\", with a broad purple stripe.\nIn the time of the Emperor Augustus, no Roman man was allowed to appear in the Roman forum without a toga.\n\nThe ancient Romans had two words for white; \"albus\", a plain white, (the source of the word \"albino\"); and \"candidus,\" a brighter white. A man who wanted public office in Rome wore a white toga brightened with chalk, called a \"toga candida\", the origin of the word \"candidate\". The Latin word \"candere\" meant to shine, to be bright. It was the origin of the words \"candle\" and \"candid\".\n\nIn ancient Rome, the priestesses of the goddess Vesta dressed in white linen robes, a white palla or shawl, and a white veil. They protected the sacred fire and the penates of Rome. White symbolized their purity, loyalty, and chastity.\n\nThe early Christian church adopted the Roman symbolism of white as the color of purity, sacrifice and virtue. It became the color worn by priests during Mass, the color worn by monks of the Cistercian Order, and, under Pope Pius V, a former monk of the Dominican Order, it became the official color worn by the pope himself. Monks of the Order of Saint Benedict dressed in the white or gray of natural undyed wool, but later changed to black, the color of humility and penitence.\n\nPostclassical history art, the white lamb became the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ on behalf of mankind. John the Baptist described Christ as the lamb of God, who took the sins of the world upon himself. The white lamb was the center of one of the most famous paintings of the Medieval period, the \"Ghent Altarpiece\" by Jan van Eyck.\n\nWhite was also the symbolic color of the transfiguration. The Gospel of Saint Mark describes Jesus' clothing in this event as \"shining, exceeding white as snow.\" Artists such as Fra Angelico used their skill to capture the whiteness of his garments. In his painting of the transfiguration at the Convent of Saint Mark in Florence, Fra Angelico emphasized the white garment by using a light gold background, placed in an almond-shaped halo.\n\nThe white unicorn was a common subject of Postclassical history manuscripts, paintings and tapestries. It was a symbol of purity, chastity and grace, which could only be captured by a virgin. It was often portrayed in the lap of the Virgin Mary.\n\nDuring the Postclassical history, painters rarely ever mixed colors; but in the Renaissance, the influential humanist and scholar Leon Battista Alberti encouraged artists to add white to their colors to make them lighter, brighter, and to add \"hilaritas\", or gaiety. Many painters followed his advice, and the palette of the Renaissance was considerably brighter.\n\nUntil the 16th century, white was commonly worn by widows as a color of mourning. The widows of the kings of France wore white until Anne of Brittany in the 16th century. A white tunic was also worn by many knights, along with a red cloak, which showed the knights were willing to give their blood for the king or Church.\n\nWhite was the dominant color of architectural interiors in the Baroque period and especially the Rococo style that followed it in the 18th century. Church interiors were designed to show the power, glory and wealth of the church. They seemed to be alive, filled with curves, asymmetry, mirrors, gilding, statuary and reliefs, unified by white.\n\nWhite was also a fashionable color for both men and women in the 18th century. Men in the aristocracy and upper classes wore powdered white wigs and white stockings, and women wore elaborate embroidered white and pastel gowns.\n\nAfter the French Revolution, a more austere white (\"blanc cassé\") became the most fashionable color in women's costumes which were modeled after the outfits of Ancient Greece and Republican Rome. Because of the rather revealing design of these dresses, the ladies wearing them were called \"les merveilleuses\" (the marvellous) by French men of that era. The Empire style under Emperor Napoléon I was modeled after the more conservative outfits of Ancient Imperial Rome. The dresses were high in fashion but low in warmth considering the more severe weather conditions of northern France; in 1814 the former wife of Napoleon, Joséphine de Beauharnais, caught pneumonia and died after taking a walk in the cold night air with Tsar Alexander I of Russia.\n\nWhite was the universal color of both men and women's underwear and of sheets in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was unthinkable to have sheets or underwear of any other color. The reason was simple; the manner of washing linen in boiling water caused colors to fade. When linen was worn out, it was collected and turned into high-quality paper.\n\nThe 19th-century American painter James McNeill Whistler (1834–1903), working at the same time as the French impressionists, created a series of paintings with musical titles where he used color to create moods, the way composers used music. His painting \"Symphony in White No. 1 – The White Girl\", which used his mistress Joanna Hiffernan as a model, used delicate colors to portray innocence and fragility, and a moment of uncertainty.\nThe White movement was the opposition that formed against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War, which followed the Russian Revolution in 1917. It was finally defeated by the Bolsheviks in 1921–22, and many of its members emigrated to Europe.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, lead white was still the most popular pigment; but between 1916 and 1918, chemical companies in Norway and the United States began to produce titanium white, made from titanium oxide. It had first been identified in the 18th century by the German chemist Martin Klaproth, who also discovered uranium. It had twice the covering power of lead white, and was the brightest white pigment known. By 1945, 80 percent of the white pigments sold were titanium white.\n\nThe absoluteness of white appealed to modernist painters. It was used in its simplest form by the Russian suprematist painter Kazimir Malevich in his 1917 painting 'the white square,' the companion to his earlier 'black square.' It was also used by the Dutch modernist painter Piet Mondrian. His most famous paintings consisted of a pure white canvas with grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles of primary colors.\n\nBlack and white also appealed to modernist architects, such as Le Corbusier (1887–1965). He said a house was \"a machine for living in\" and called for a \"calm and powerful architecture\" built of reinforced concrete and steel, without any ornament or frills. Almost all the buildings of contemporary architect Richard Meier, such as his museum in Rome to house the ancient Roman Ara Pacis, or Altar of Peace, are stark white, in the tradition of Le Corbusier.\n\nLight is perceived by the human visual system as white when the incoming light to the eye stimulates all three types of color sensitive cone cells in the eye in roughly equal amounts. Materials that do not emit light themselves appear white if their surfaces reflect back most of the light that strikes them in a diffuse way.\n\nIn 1666, Isaac Newton demonstrated that white light could be broken up into its composite colors by passing it through a prism, then using a second prism to reassemble them. Before Newton, most scientists believed that white was the fundamental color of light.\n\nWhite light can be generated by the sun, by stars, or by earthbound sources such as fluorescent lamps, white LEDs and incandescent bulbs. On the screen of a color television or computer, white is produced by mixing the primary colors of light: red, green and blue (RGB) at full intensity, a process called additive mixing (see image below). White light can be fabricated using light with only two wavelengths, for instance by mixing light from a red and cyan laser or yellow and blue lasers. This light will however have very few practical applications since color rendering of objects will be greatly distorted.\n\nThe fact that light sources with vastly different spectral power distributions can result in a similar sensory experience is due to the way the light is processed by the visual system. One color that arises from two different spectral power distributions is called a metamerism.\n\nMany of the light sources that emit white light emit light at almost all visible wavelengths (sun light, incandescent lamps of various Color temperatures). This has led to the notion that white light can be defined as a mixture of \"all colors\" or \"all visible wavelengths\". This widespread idea is a misconception, and might originally stem from the fact that Newton discovered that \"sunlight\" is composed of light with wavelengths across the visible spectrum. Concluding that \"since \"all colors\" produce white light then white must be made up of \"all colors\"\" is a common logical error called affirming the consequent, which might be the cause of the misunderstanding.\n\nA range of spectral distributions of light sources can be perceived as white—there is no single, unique specification of \"white light\". For example, when you buy a \"white\" light bulb, you might buy one labeled 2700K, 6000K, etc., which produce light having very different spectral distributions, and yet this will not prevent you from identifying the color of objects that they illuminate.\n\nColor vision allows us to distinguish different \"objects\" by their color. In order to do so, color constancy can keep the perceived color of an object relatively unchanged when the illumination changes among various broad (whitish) spectral distributions of light.\n\nThe same principle is used in photography and cinematography where the choice of white point determines a transformation of all other color stimuli. Changes in or manipulation of the white point can be used to explain some optical illusions such as The dress.\n\nWhile there is no single, unique specification of \"white light\", there is indeed a unique specification of \"white object\", or, more specifically, \"white surface\".\nA perfectly white surface diffusely reflects (scatters) all visible light that strikes it, without absorbing any, irrespective of the light's wavelength or spectral distribution.\nSince it does not absorb any of the incident light, white is the lightest possible color.\nIf the reflection is not diffuse but rather specular, this describes a mirror rather than a white surface.\n\nReflection of 100% of incident light at all wavelengths is a form of uniform reflectance, so white is an achromatic color, meaning a color without hue. The color stimulus produced by the perfect diffuser is usually considered to be an achromatic stimulus for all illuminants, except for those whose light sources appear to be highly chromatic.\n\nColor constancy is achieved by chromatic adaptation. The International Commission on Illumination defines \"white (adapted)\" as \"a color stimulus that an observer who is [chromatically] adapted to the viewing environment would judge to be perfectly achromatic and to have a luminance factor of unity. The color stimulus that is considered to be the adapted white may be different at different locations within a scene.\n\nBeaches with sand containing high amounts of quartz or eroded limestone also appear white, since quartz and limestone reflect or scatter sunlight, rather than absorbing it. Tropical white sand beaches may also have a high quantity of white calcium carbonate from tiny bits of seashells ground to fine sand by the action of the waves.\n\nThe White Cliffs of Dover take their white color from the large amount of chalk, made of limestone, which they contain, which reflects the sunlight.\n\nSnow is a mixture of air and tiny ice crystals. When white sunlight enters snow, very little of the spectrum is absorbed; almost all of the light is reflected or scattered by the air and water molecules, so the snow appears to be the color of sunlight, white. Sometimes the light bounces around inside the ice crystals before being scattered, making the snow seem to sparkle.\n\nIn the case of glaciers, the ice is more tightly pressed together and contains little air. As sunlight enters the ice, more light of the red spectrum is absorbed, so the light scattered will be bluish.\n\nClouds are white for the same reason as ice. They are composed of water droplets or ice crystals mixed with air, very little light that strikes them is absorbed, and most of the light is scattered, appearing to the eye as white. Shadows of other clouds above can make clouds look gray, and some clouds have their own shadow on the bottom of the cloud.\n\nMany mountains with winter or year-round snow cover are named accordingly: Mauna Kea means \"white mountain\" in Hawaiian, Mont Blanc means \"white mountain\" in French. Changbai Mountains literally meaning \"perpetually white mountains\", marks the border between China and Korea.\n\nChalk is a kind of limestone, made of the mineral calcite, or calcium carbonate. It was originally deposited under the sea as the scales or plates of tiny micro-organisms called Coccolithophore. It was the first white pigment used by prehistoric artists in cave paintings. The chalk used on blackboards today is usually made of gypsum or calcium sulphate, a powder pressed into sticks.\n\n\"Bianco di San Giovanni\" is a pigment used in the Renaissance, which was described by the painter Cennino Cennini in the 15th century. It is similar to chalk, made of calcium carbonate with calcium hydroxide. It was made of dried lime which was made into a powder, then soaked in water for eight days, with the water changed each day. It was then made into cakes and dried in the sun.\n\nLead white was being produced during the 4th century BC; the process is described is Pliny the Elder, Vitruvius and the ancient Greek author Theophrastus. Pieces of lead were put into clay pots which had a separate compartment filled with vinegar. The pots in turn were piled on shelves close to cow dung. The combined fumes of the vinegar and the cow dung caused the lead to corrode into lead carbonate. It was a slow process which could take a month or more. It made an excellent white and was used by artists for centuries, but it was also toxic. It was replaced in the 19th century by zinc white and titanium white.\n\nTitanium white is the most popular white for artists today; it is the brightest available white pigment, and has twice the coverage of lead white. It first became commercially available in 1921. It is made out of titanium dioxide, from the minerals brookite, anatase, rutile, or ilmenite, currently the major source. Because of its brilliant whiteness, it is used as a colorant for most toothpaste and sunscreen.\n\nZinc white is made from zinc oxide. It is similar to but not as opaque as titanium white. It is added to some breakfast cereals, since zinc is an important nutrient. Chinese white is a variety of zinc white made for artists.\n\nSome materials can be made to look \"whiter than white\", this is achieved using optical brightener agents (OBA). These are chemical compounds that absorb light in the ultraviolet and violet region (usually 340–370 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420–470 nm). OBAs are often used in paper and clothing to create an impression of very bright white. This is due to the fact that the materials actually send out more visible light than they receive.\n\nBleaching is a process for whitening fabrics which has been practiced for thousands of years. Sometimes it was simply a matter of leaving the fabric in the sun, to be faded by the bright light. In the 18th century several scientists developed varieties of chlorine bleach, including sodium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder). Bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine most often are based on peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate. While most bleaches are oxidizing agents, a fewer number are reducing agents such as sodium dithionite.\n\nBleaches attack the chromophores, the part of a molecule which absorbs light and causes fabrics to have different colors. An oxidizing bleach works by breaking the chemical bonds that make up the chromophore. This changes the molecule into a different substance that either does not contain a chromophore, or contains a chromophore that does not absorb visible light. A reducing bleach works by converting double bonds in the chromophore into single bonds. This eliminates the ability of the chromophore to absorb visible light.\n\nSunlight acts as a bleach through a similar process. High energy photons of light, often in the violet or ultraviolet range, can disrupt the bonds in the chromophore, rendering the resulting substance colorless.\n\nSome detergents go one step further; they contain fluorescent chemicals which glow, making the fabric look literally whiter than white.\n\nA white dwarf is a stellar remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. They are very dense; a white dwarf's mass is comparable to that of the Sun and its volume is comparable to that of the Earth. Its faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy. A white dwarf is very hot when it is formed, but since it has no source of energy, it will gradually radiate away its energy and cool down. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool to temperatures at which it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and it will become a cold black dwarf. However, since no white dwarf can be older than the Age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), even the oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins, and no black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.\n\nAn A-type main-sequence star (A V) or A dwarf star is a main-sequence (hydrogen-burning) star of spectral type A and luminosity class V. These stars have spectra which are defined by strong hydrogen Balmer absorption lines. They have masses from 1.4 to 2.1 times the mass of the Sun and surface temperatures between 7600 and 11 500  K.\n\nWhite animals use their color as a form of camouflage in winter.\nWhite is an important symbolic color in most religions and cultures, usually because of its association with purity. \n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, white is associated with Jesus Christ, innocence and sacrifice. Since the Middle Ages, priests wear a white cassock in many of the most important ceremonies and religious services connected with events in the life of Christ. White is worn by priests at Christmas, during Easter, and during celebrations connected with the other events of the life of Christ, such as Corpus Christi Sunday, and Trinity Sunday. It is also worn at the services dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and to those Saints who were not martyred, as well as other special occasions, such as the ordination of priests and the installation of new bishops. Within the hierarchy of the church, the lighter the color, the higher the rank. Ordinary priests wear black; bishops wear violet, cardinals wear red, and outside a church, only the Pope will wear white. Popes occasionally wore white in the Middle Ages, but usually wore red. Popes have worn white regularly since 1566, when Pope Pius V, a member of the Dominican Order, began the practice. White is the color of the Dominican Order.\n\nIn Islam, white clothing is worn during required pilgrimage to Mecca, or \"Ihram\" pilgrimage (\"Hajj\").Hajj. Called Ihram clothing, men's garments often consist of two white un-hemmed sheets (usually towelling material).
