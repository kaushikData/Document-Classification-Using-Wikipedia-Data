{"id": "3133697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3133697", "title": "African literature", "text": "African literature\n\nAfrican literature is literature of or from Africa.\n\nAs George Joseph notes in his chapter on African literature in \"Understanding Contemporary Africa\", whereas European views of literature often stressed a separation of art and content, African awareness is inclusive:\n\nExamples of pre-colonial African literature are numerous. In Ethiopia, there is a substantial literature written in Ge'ez going back at least to the fourth century AD; the best-known work in this tradition is the \"Kebra Negast\", or \"Book of Kings.\" One popular form of traditional African folktale is the \"trickster\" story, in which a small animal uses its wits to survive encounters with larger creatures. Examples of animal tricksters include Anansi, a spider in the folklore of the Ashanti people of Ghana; Ijàpá, a tortoise in Yoruba folklore of Nigeria; and Sungura, a hare found in central and East African folklore. Other works in written form are abundant, namely in north Africa, the Sahel regions of west Africa and on the Swahili coast. From Timbuktu alone, there are an estimated 300,000 or more manuscripts tucked away in various libraries and private collections, mostly written in Arabic but some in the native languages (namely Fula and Songhai). Many were written at the famous University of Timbuktu. The material covers a wide array of topics, including astronomy, poetry, law, history, faith, politics, and philosophy. Swahili literature similarly, draws inspiration from Islamic teachings but developed under indigenous circumstances. One of the most renowned and earliest pieces of Swahili literature being \"Utendi wa Tambuka\" or \"The Story of Tambuka\".\n\nIn Islamic times, North Africans such as Ibn Khaldun attained great distinction within Arabic literature. Medieval north Africa boasted universities such as those of Fes and Cairo, with copious amounts of literature to supplement them.\n\nThe African works best known in the West from the periods of colonization and the slave trade are primarily slave narratives, such as Olaudah Equiano's \"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano\" (1789).\n\nIn the colonial period, Africans exposed to Western languages began to write in those tongues. In 1911, Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford (also known as Ekra-Agiman) of the Gold Coast (now Ghana) published what is probably the first African novel written in English, \"Ethiopia Unbound: Studies in Race Emancipation\". Although the work moves between fiction and political advocacy, its publication and positive reviews in the Western press mark a watershed moment in African literature.\n\nDuring this period, African plays written in English began to emerge. Herbert Isaac Ernest Dhlomo of South Africa published the first English-language African play, \"\" in 1935. In 1962, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o of Kenya wrote the first East African drama, \"The Black Hermit\", a cautionary tale about \"tribalism\" (discrimination between African tribes).\n\nAmong the first pieces of African literature to receive significant worldwide critical acclaim was \"Things Fall Apart\", by Chinua Achebe. Published in 1958, late in the colonial era, \"Things Fall Apart\" analyzed the effect of colonialism on traditional African society.\n\nAfrican literature in the late colonial period (between the end of World War I and independence) increasingly showed themes of liberation, independence, and (among Africans in French-controlled territories) négritude. One of the leaders of the négritude movement, the poet and eventual President of Senegal, Léopold Sédar Senghor, published in 1948 the first anthology of French-language poetry written by Africans, \"Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache de langue française\" (\"Anthology of the New Black and Malagasy Poetry in the French Language\"), featuring a preface by the French existentialist writer Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nFor many writers this emphasis was not restricted to their publishing. Many, indeed, suffered deeply and directly: censured for casting aside his artistic responsibilities in order to participate actively in warfare, Christopher Okigbo was killed in battle for Biafra against the Nigerian movement of the 1960s' civil war; Mongane Wally Serote was detained under South Africa's Terrorism Act No 83 of 1967 between 1969 and 1970, and subsequently released without ever having stood trial; in London in 1970, his countryman Arthur Norje committed suicide; Malawi's Jack Mapanje was incarcerated with neither charge nor trial because of an off-hand remark at a university pub; and, in 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged by the Nigerian junta.\n\nWith liberation and increased literacy since most African nations gained their independence in the 1950s and 1960s, African literature has grown dramatically in quantity and in recognition, with numerous African works appearing in Western academic curricula and on \"best of\" lists compiled at the end of the 20th century. African writers in this period wrote both in Western languages (notably English, French, and Portuguese) and in traditional African languages such as Hausa.\n\nAli A. Mazrui and others mention seven conflicts as themes: the clash between Africa's past and present, between tradition and modernity, between indigenous and foreign, between individualism and community, between socialism and capitalism, between development and self-reliance and between Africanity and humanity. Other themes in this period include social problems such as corruption, the economic disparities in newly independent countries, and the rights and roles of women. Female writers are today far better represented in published African literature than they were prior to independence.\n\nIn 1986, Wole Soyinka became the first post-independence African writer to win the Nobel Prize in literature. Previously, Algerian-born Albert Camus had been awarded the 1957 prize.\n\nThere is a lot of literary production in Africa since the beginning of the current decade (2010), even though readers do not always follow in large numbers. One can also notice the appearance of certain writings that break with the academic style. In addition, the shortage of literary critics can be explored on the continent nowadays. Literary events seem to be very fashionable, including literary awards, some of which can be distinguished by their original concepts. The case of the Grand Prix of Literary Associations is quite illustrative.\n\nInaugurated in 1980 and running till 2009, the Noma Award for Publishing in Africa was presented for the outstanding work of the year published in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "854005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=854005", "title": "American Type Founders", "text": "American Type Founders\n\nAmerican Type Founders (ATF) was a business trust created in 1892 by the merger of 23 type foundries, representing about 85% of all type manufactured in the United States. The new company, consisting of a consolidation of firms from throughout the United States, was incorporated in New Jersey.\n\nATF was the dominant American manufacturer of metal type from its creation in 1892 until at least the 1940s; it continued to be influential into the 1960s. Many fonts developed by American Type Founders in its period of dominance, including News Gothic, Century Schoolbook, Franklin Gothic, Hobo and Bank Gothic, are still in everyday use.\n\nBy the beginning of the final decade of the nineteenth century, type founding was in a state of crisis. With the introduction of the Linotype, which could cast whole lines of body type in-house, demand for hand-set type was down. Throughout the late 1880s prices had been maintained by an informal cartel of foundries, but as the number of foundries increased, and then with the invention of hot metal type, prices dropped dramatically. Additionally, type at this time was not standardized, either to body size or to base line, and printers resented the incompatibility of types from different foundries. Leaders in the industry, notably Joseph W. Phinney of the Dickinson Type Foundry in Boston, set up a committee to address these problems, eventually recommending consolidation.\n\nBy the late 1880s, there were some 34 foundries in the United States. In 1892, 23 foundries were brought together to form the American Type Founders Company. Key to the success of this merger was the inclusion of MacKellar, Smiths, & Jordan Co. of Philadelphia, with assets of over $6 million, the Cincinnati Type Foundry of Henry Barth, which brought with it the patents to his Barth Typecaster, and Benton, Waldo Foundry of Milwaukee, which included Linn Boyd Benton and his all-important Benton Pantograph which engraved type matrices directly instead of using punches and allowed the optical scaling of type. With the inclusion of the Barth Caster and the Benton Pantograph, ATF immediately became the largest and the most technologically advanced foundry in the world.\n\nConditions for the first few years were chaotic: while 12 foundries ceased separate operations immediately member foundries continued to operate as if they were independent firms. Real consolidation did not begin until 1894, when Robert Wickham Nelson, principal owner of the Throne Typesetting Machine Company and a new stockholder in ATF, became general manager. He immediately began to liquidate unprofitable ventures, eliminate duplications, and force the various branches to do business under the ATF name instead of retaining their former ones. Linn Boyd Benton's son, Morris Fuller Benton, was given the job of purging obsolete and duplicated type faces from the catalogs, and standardizing the point size and base-line of the types made. Nelson, realizing that display and advertising type (rather than the body type that was set so efficiently by the new line-casters) would be the mainstay of the foundry type business, immediately began an extensive advertising campaign and commissioned the production of new type designs. Joseph W. Phinney was put in charge of the design department and he supervised the introduction of Cushing, Howland, Bradley, and the William Morris inspired Satanick and Jenson Oldstyle, the last of these being hugely successful. Young Benton was then commissioned to finish Lewis Buddy's Elbert Hubbard inspired Roycroft, another successful introduction.\n\nWhile Phinney often used free-lance designers, like Will Bradley, T.M. Cleland, Walter Dorwin Teague, Frederic Goudy, and Oz Cooper, the bulk of ATF's catalog through the 1930s was the creation of Morris Fuller Benton. Though he never became well known, even within the printing industry, Benton enjoyed a record of successful type introductions unparalleled by anyone, much to the profit of ATF. Benton, though he did not invent either idea, was the most successful designer of revivals of historical type designs (such as his re-cutting of Bodoni and Garamond) and he perfected the creation of \"type families\" (such as Century or most successfully Cheltenham) where a basic face would be offered in italic, light, bold, extended and condensed variations.\n\nAnother key player at ATF at this time was the advertising manager (and informal corporate historian) Henry Lewis Bullen, who created a typographic library of historical examples for designers to draw upon. This collection was turned over to Columbia University's Rare Book and Manuscript Library in 1936. The books form the core of the book arts collection at Columbia. There is also an archive of ATF materials in Columbia's special collections.\n\nIn 1901, Nelson consolidated casting operations in a purpose-built factory in Jersey City and the branches remained only as distribution centers. By the 1920s, ATF had offices in 27 American cities and Vancouver, British Columbia, where it sold not only type, but pressroom supplies and printing presses (their own Kelly line and those of other manufacturers) as well. It printed large specimen books, with many examples of good layout as examples for the advertising market. In 1923, at a cost of $300,000, ATF produced its largest and most superlative type catalog. Sixty thousand of these opulent books, printed extensively in color, were distributed, and to this day they are considered to be masterpieces of the art of letterpress printing. The first paragraph of its preface boasted:\n\nThe printing of 1923 is greatly superior to that of 1900. It has better style, more attractiveness and greater power and dignity…This great improvement has not come to pass without direction. There has been, in fact, very deliberate direction. There has been constant and forward thinking on behalf of the printing industry by the American Type Founders Company, which has a well defined policy with regard to the types it is making and has been making during the last quarter century. In what position, may we ask, would the printing industry be to-day without the great type families, known to fame as Cheltenham, Century \"[long list follows]\" and others? Are there anywhere any other type families? Would not your typography be barren in appearance and much less profitable to the advertisers if these great type designs had not been developed? There can be but one answer.\n\nBy the time Nelson died in 1926, ATF seemed to be on the path to permanent profitability.\n\nNelson's successor as president, Frank Belknap Berry (originally one of the founders of the Cleveland Type Foundry), was unpopular with the board and he was soon replaced by Joseph F. Gillick, whose first move was to shut down ATF's subsidiary Barnhard Brothers & Spindler in Chicago and bring their casting operations to Jersey City. Though the years immediately after Nelson's passing were disappointing, 1929 was the most profitable in ATF history.\n\nFrom 1914 to 1959 ATF manufactured letterpresses. During the 1920s and 30s they also sold presses made by \"Chandler & Price\", \"Laureate\", and \"Thomson National Company\".\n\nWhen William M. Kelly (1869–1949), an employee in the sales department, proposed a design of automatic cylinder press, Nelson immediately authorized the project. The Kelly Style B Press, a three-roller, two-revolution, flat-bed cylinder press with automatic feeder and jogger was introduced in 1914 to great success. By 1923 more than 2,500 Kelly Presses had been sold and the next year production was shifted from Jersey City to a large new factory in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Several models were developed and, by 1949, more than 11,000 Kelly presses had been sold.\n\n\nProduction of Kelly presses ceased at ATF in 1954, though Vickers continued to produce two models in England until 1959.\n\nIn 1918 Golding & Company, a typefoundry that also manufactured the Pearl line of letterpress, was acquired by ATF. These presses continued to be made and sold by the Golding Press Division of ATF until 1927, when the division was sold off to Thomson National Company.\n\nIn addition to selling presses made by Chandler & Price, ATF produced the Klymax Feeder which turned C&P's hand-fed Gordon jobber press into an automatically feed press. As such presses were ubiquitous, sales of this feeder were robust throughout the 1920s.\n\nIn the post-war years, ATF produced the Little Giant Automatic Cylinder Press, a smaller (12\" x 18\" sheet size), more compact press of much more modern design than the Kelly presses. Production of this press ceased in 1959.\n\nUnfortunately for ATF, unlike printing consumables (like paper and ink), which must be purchased anew for each job, type wears slowly and its purchase can be postponed in hard times, while capital investment in new presses simply dries up, and so ATF was especially hard hit by the Depression. Also, the company had been over-extended in the boom years, too much credit had been extended to the trade, inventories were bloated, and the corps of executives (many left over from pre-consolidation days) were older and without vision. With the financial downturn after 1929 ATF began to see serious distress. In 1931 hours were cut at the factories. The following year, sales were down another 25% and salaries were cut. When major accounting errors showed that company to be even less profitable than was thought, Gillick was forced to resign.\n\nThomas Roy Jones, a businessman with no experience in type founding, replaced Gillick. By 1933 the situation was desperate. Sales of type were less than 30% of 1926 levels while purchases of Kelly presses had plummeted to a mere 6.8% of what they had been. In October 1933 Jones filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy. ATF was placed under the control of its creditors (chiefly consisting of several banks) and drastic measures were taken. Operations were consolidated, the Jersey City plant was closed and the typecasting operations moved to the Kelly plant in Elizabeth. Salesmen were put on a commission basis. Inventories were cut, faces discontinued, and production of several models of Kelly press as well as the Klymax Feeder was shut down. ATF was released from court supervision in 1936 and in 1938 a sales study was made making the following observations: the Kelly press was obsolete, body type was now the exclusive province of line-casters and display type would have to be the mainstay of type production, almost half of what ATF was selling was other manufacturers products that could easily be made in their own facilities, the acquisition of or merger with another firm in the letterpress industry would be desirable, as offset was a rising technology ATF needed to invest in that business.\n\nIn 1938, ATF purchased the Webendorfer-Wills Company and began producing their models of offset press. ATF sold these presses under the Chief name, marketing a Little Chief, Chief, and Big Chief. Large press (as opposed to duplicator) production continued until the late 1970s when the 25\" Profiteer was discontinued as the basic Webendorfer design became obsolete. Once again, ATF had made the mistake they had with the Kelly press of complacently taking profits from a successful product, not investing in improvements, and eventually seeing this product become irretrievably overtaken by the competition. Beginning in the 1970s, arrangements to sell large offset presses under the Chief name were made with other manufacturers, first with MAN Roland and then with Solna.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the ATF plant in Elizabeth was converted almost entirely over to military production. Barth Casters were used to make firing pins and ATF operated two plants in Newark making ordnance.\n\nAfter the war, ill-conceived efforts were made to diversify. A furniture manufacturer, Dystrom Corporation, was acquired. A competitor, Lanston Monotype, was purchased in 1969, but nothing came of this, the assets being sold off later to M&H Typefounders.\n\nThe decline of foundry type in this period might well be illustrated by the size of ATF specimen books. While the magnificent 1923 catalog was typical of its day at 1148 pages, subsequent editions were ever smaller. The 1934 catalog was only 207 pages, while the 1941 catalog was only slightly smaller at 191 pages. By 1956 the \"descriptive index of types\" was down to only 24 pages, but this recovered a little by 1966's catalog of 30 pages. The last ATF catalog, published in 1976 and distributed right to the end, was down to only 14 pages and, by the 1980s, came with an insert listing the faces that were no longer available.\n\nSome innovations did take place during this period however. The brilliant lettering artist Charles H. Hughes was engaged to produce a new version of the popular Century Type that would reproduce the same in offset and letterpress and the result was the lovely Century Nova (1965). ATF also produced the first optically scanning typeface, OCR-A font, in 1969 and this remains the standard on printed bank checks to this day.\n\nA venture was made into photocomposition with the ATF Hadego Typesetter. Introduced in 1958, the first model was the \"A\". Not many were produced because the character fit left much to be desired. The most common model was the \"B\". Character fit was improved by employing the Friden Flexowriter \"Justowriter\" escape mechanism to six units. The last and most advanced model based on the Friden mechanism was the \"B-8\", where an eighth unit was added to the escape mechanism by means of a series of electro-mechanical relays that could add the eighth unit to some wider characters, like capital \"M\", without changing the basic mechanical escape mechanism of the model \"B\". The last phototypesetter designed and produced by ATF was the Photocomp 20, so named because of its rated speed of twenty 11-pica newspaper lines per minute. It featured four stepper motors (1) to move the film across, (2) to move the type disk, (3) to advance the film to the next line, and (4) to set the size of one unit of escapement. Type disks contained four fonts, each including 17 pi characters. Its controller was the first ATF controller utilizing integrated circuits in place of relays. Circuitry was based on Motorola DTL integrated circuits. Machine styling of the Photocomp 20 was by Richard Arbib. Only 17 machines were sold: one in Vienna Austria, and the remainder in North America.\n\nATF produced type disks with all their popular type faces. These disks were concentric rings of fonts on a transparent plastic material in negative form. Usually these disks contained roman, italic and bold versions of the same face. There was even a disk with the only Canadian type design at the time, called \"Cartier\". The ATF Phototypesetter was sold world wide—in Canada, Germany, Italy, Denmark, France, Belgium, England, etc. In Denmark, several newspapers were produced on ATF Phototypesetters by a company named \"Reprodan\". As technology improved, ATF failed to keep pace and eventually the line was discontinued.\n\nIn the mid-1950s the small offset (duplicator) market was dominated by Addressograph-Multilith's Multi-1250 almost without competition. A study undertaken by Whitin Machine Works, a manufacturer of textile making machinery looking to expand out of an industry depressed by the introduction of synthetic fabrics, suggested that \"quick printing\" done with duplicators was a growing market. Whitin thus acquired ATF in 1957, began to manufacture a small (10 x 15\" sheet size) duplicator at their Whitinsville, Massachusetts facility, and to market this under the name ATF Chief 15. The basic design was by Louis Mestre, and it incorporated many large press features as he had free use of Webendorfer patents. As it gave large press performance, it was an immediate success with commercial printers (who were disdainful of duplicators), and the Chief line remained the best of the small presses until the introduction of Heidelberg's T-Offset in the late 1980s. A larger Chief 17 was introduced in the 1960s and the 1970s saw \"common blanket\" two color models of both the 15 and 17. Both Chief models were made and sold in Europe by Gestetner Cyclograph Company, and were also marketed in the United States by the Itek and Ditto corporations.\n\nThough the Chief could produce superlative work, unlike the highly popular A.B. Dick 350, it required a skilled operator. Unfortunately for ATF, the quick printing industry had less use for such quality work and more need of a \"fast and dirty\" duplicator like the 350 and so its market penetration was limited.\n\nIn 1966 White Consolidated Industries acquired the Whitin Machine Works and with it control of A.T.F.\n\nATF later purchased the competing Davidson line of duplicators and changed their name to ATF-Davidson. Breaking their pattern of low investment in upgrading technology, ATF actually developed improved models of the Davidson and this line remained competitive right to the end. The Davidson however, was an unusual design (with two, rather than the usual three cylinders) and its popularity remained limited.\n\nBy the 1980s the foundry in Elizabeth, New Jersey was down to only six employees and duplicator manufacture was the principle business of ATF-Davidson. In 1986 foundry was sold off to Kingsley Machines, a maker of foil-stamping type, and the merged company was renamed Kingsley/ATF. Immediately a bid was made to enter the field of digital typography with a software subsidiary being set up in Tucson. With its enormous library of type, and its patents on the optical scaling of type, a digital library of ATF types seemed to be a good investment. As the original drawings of the faces were mostly lost, these fonts had to be scanned from brass matrices, a daunting prospect. The work was well done, but slow, and only four faces (Wedding Text, Thompson Quill Script, Bernhard Fashion, and T.M. Cleland's border designs) were ever issued before Kingsley/ATF sought bankruptcy protection in 1993. An auction was held on 23 August 1993 and all the assets of the foundry were sold off, most of the priceless matrices going to scrap dealers. ATF designs remain the property of Kingsley Holding Corporation and are now licensed through Adobe and Bitstream. ATF's factory is now an apartment block.\n\nThough ATF is now defunct, some of their original type casting machines and matrix engraving equipment are still in use at The Dale Guild Type Foundry in Howell, New Jersey. This equipment was saved through efforts coordinated by Theo Rehak, the last person trained to run these machines at ATF's Elizabeth, New Jersey facility.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the Chief line needed updating and a crash program was undertaken to produce a press that could compete with the A.B.Dick 9800 series. The SuperChief was thus introduced in 1986 with many flaws. Most of these were worked out, and the basic design was re-launched in 1988 as the X-Press line. Unfortunately, this was too late to save the reputation of the Chief line and the company shut down in July 1990. After a period of confusion, Jim Hughes of Printer's Parts Store purchased the assets of the company and operated under the name of ATF-Graphic Products, selling presses that were on hand and supplying spare parts. Wishing to revive the Davidson line of presses, the Chief line was sold off to Jim Wheet who now supplies parts for existing presses under the name ATF Services Inc., while it is unclear if Printer's Parts remains interested in reviving the Davidson line of presses.\n\nThe original group of foundries that came together in 1892:\nFrom the merger in 1892 until 1903, when all typecasting was centralized in Jersey City, these foundries were consolidated into the following branches and codes:\n\n"}
{"id": "1577701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1577701", "title": "Arg of Tabriz", "text": "Arg of Tabriz\n\nArg of Tabriz (, also known as \"Arg Alishah\", \"Arg-e Alishah\", \"Arch of Alishah\", \"Arg Citadel\", and \"Masjid Ali-Shāh\"), is the remnants of a big fortification and city wall in downtown Tabriz. Ark's structure is visible from far distances in downtown of Tabriz, if not blocked by newly high raised building.\n\nThe structure was initially raised as a mausoleum in 14th century during the Ilkhanate era. However, with the sudden death of the governor of the city and with some construction complications in constructing a roofed building without pillar for such a huge complex, the mausoleum structure remained incomplete. In the 19th century with the rise of tensions between Iran and Russia the structure rapidly turned into the city's fort and additional military installations such as a barracks and cannon foundry were added to the original structure. During the twentieth century the military installations were removed from original construction and the surrounding of the ark turned into a park. In the late twentieth century a big mosque was built next to the citadel. \n\nThe original construction was made between 1318 and 1339, during the Ilkhanate. During the construction, the roof of the mausoleum collapsed and the construction was stopped afterward. Centuries later, between the eruption of the Russo-Persian War, 1804-1813, and the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828), the compound was quickly reconstructed as a military compound. During the reconstruction of the Arg compound, a foundry factory for the manufacturing of cannons for the Iranian Army was built as well as a military headquarters, a barrack for the troops, and a small palace.. Samson Makintsev (better known as \"Samson Khan\") a Qajar Iranian general of Russian origin, lived inside the citadel for years together with his wife, the daughter of Prince Aleksandre of Georgia. \n\nDuring the Russian invasion of Tabriz in 1911, the Russians shelled the Arg in initial attacks. Once they captured the city, they used the Arg as a central command center. During their occupation, because of careless handling, the artillery pieces they used set fire to parts of Arg.\n\nDuring the Pahlavi era, parts of the Arg which had been constructed in the 19th century during the Qajar dynasty were destroyed. This destruction was with the aim of purifying the original Arg construction of its later development. The southern part of the Arg was turned into a park, the \"Mellat Garden\" (lit. \"park of the people\"), before the Iranian revolution in 1979.\n\nIn the early 1980s after the suppression of uprising of supporters of Muslim People's Republic Party against the new establishment of mixing religion and state and neglecting of Azerbaijani minorities, Moslem Malakuti selected Juma of Tabriz as the new Imam. During his tenure in Tabriz, Juma began the destruction of Ark's Qajar era addendum wall, cultural institutes and ark theater and replaced them with a new mosque for Friday prayers. Some people believe this destruction of local heritage was a systematic destruction of local Azerbaijani identity.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, a rehabilitation and renovation project was executed by the Iranian Organization for Cultural Heritages. During this rehabilitation, however, all of the remaining Qajar era development from Arg citadel were destroyed. At the same period, a new big mosque was built next to the Arg citadel. The superstructure of the new mosque undermine the architecture of Arg citadel. Despite the regulations of the Iranian Organization for Cultural Heritages and several court hearing the construction of the new structure was completed.\n\nThis action completely destroyed the ancient foundations of the original Arg that still existed underground and were going to be used for a reconstruction attempt at the end of the Pahlavi era. Thus, the new Islamic regime eliminated any chance of methodical reconstruction by wiping out the remaining foundations of the Arg. Ironically, this was done in order to build a new mosque, which could have been built a few dozens of yards farther away from this primary Iranian Islamic archaeological site and spare its destruction. Meanwhile, the main prayer hall of the ancient mosque was turned into a car parking lot, in direct violation of the edict of the Koran which considered a mosque's ground to be sacred and inviolable as long as the traces of it remain. It is visually clear that the new car park is created on nothing but the remains of the main prayer hall of the 700 year old grand mosque.\n\n"}

Trapped in an older body with her memory still frozen at age 12, Tang Ying struggles to cope with reality which includes the cruel truth that her family is dead.\n\nTang Ying suspects that there is more to the tragic road accident which claimed the lives of her entire family. As a result, Tang Ying embarks on a rigorous routine to learn and to familiarize herself with a society that has changed tremendously in the years when she was unconscious.\n\nDuring this time, she befriends Zou Jieming (portrayed by Elvin Ng), an autistic but highly intelligent savant, and Situ Dongcheng (portrayed by Christopher Lee), a down-and-out former lawyer who has lost everything he treasured in his life. Together, they embark on a battle against Yang Tianwei (portrayed by Guo Liang), a cruel, ruthless and cunning man who will stop at nothing in his quest to avenge his dead son Zhenjie. Tianwei's children, Chris Yang Zhenfeng (portrayed by Dai Xiangyu) and Nianqing (portrayed by Jeanette Aw), assist him in his evil deeds. It is revealed that Yang Tianwei had planned the murder of the Tang Yaozu and his family for a past grudge using a road accident and it was not an isolated incident. Will Tang Ying, Jieming and Dongcheng be able to bring him to justice before he ruins more lives?\n\nThere were no anniversary dramas in 2010. \"Breakout\" dominated the Star Awards with a string of nominations in the acting and technical categories.The other dramas that are nominated for Best Drama Series New Beginnings , The Family Court , Unriddle & With You and Best Theme Songs are New Beginnings, With You , The Best Things in Life & The illusionist.\n\nIt also won three nominations and commendations at the 2011 Asian Television Awards.\n\nDuring the awards ceremony, Christopher Lee, Huang Wenyong, Ben Yeo and other actors performed a parody of the series. Lee, portraying \"Breakout\" director Chong Liung Man, and his \"camera crew\" (played by Huang and Yeo) were filming a scene on the harbour. Veteran radio deejay Dennis Chew played Yang Tianwei, ceremony co-host Quan Yi Fong played Yang Nianqing, popular television host Lee Teng played Yang Zhenfeng, award nominee Zhou Ying reprised her role as Tang Ying and Quan's co-host Guo Liang played Zou Jieming.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47574307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47574307", "title": "Center for Hmong Arts and Talent", "text": "Center for Hmong Arts and Talent\n\nThe Center for Hmong Arts and Talent (CHAT) is an arts advocacy group based in Saint Paul, Minnesota's Frogtown neighborhood. Since its inception in 1998, CHAT has transformed into a social justice arts organization that engages with local and national Hmong communities. In addition to providing diverse arts-based programs, CHAT uses innovative strategies to address social issues affecting Hmong Americans.\n\nIn the late 1980s, playwright Jaime Meyer worked with Hmong youth to produce \"Hmong Tapestry: Voices from the Cloth\". In 1990, Meyer and director Nkauj'lis Lyfoung formed Pom Siab Hmoob Theatre (PSHT). It was the first Hmong theater company in the world. Between 1990 and 1997, PSHT wrote and produced eight successful plays in St. Paul. Of these, five were community-based and three were professionally staged.\n\nIn 1998, PSHT members decided to expand the group's focus beyond theater arts in order to serve more Hmong artists. They changed its name to the Center for Hmong Arts & Talent (CHAT). Their new work crossed multiple art genres, making CHAT the first and only multidisciplinary Hmong arts organization in the U.S. The CHAT acronym was inspired by the popularity of the internet chat rooms of the late 1990s.\n\nIn the early 2000s, CHAT debuted and refined several of its central initiatives. In the summer of 2001, it organized the first-ever Hmong Arts & Music Festival at St. Paul's Western Sculpture Park. In the fall, CHAT's youth program extended its reach by taking arts instruction into St. Paul's federal housing projects. The program was called Art Saves Us—in part because several core CHAT artists were raised in the projects, and art literally saved their lives.\n\nIn 2002, CHAT's Voice Your Mind open mic event, eventually rebranded Innovative Community Elevation (ICE) Open Mic, was created. The program took place at venues such as Hmong ABC, Jasmine Teashop, and Metro State University. It aimed to provide a supportive environment for artistic development and live performance.\n\nCHAT's involvement in technology and multimedia led to production efforts in music and film. It produced multiple videos and music compilations in the mid-2000s, including \"Hmongtopia: All About ABC's\" (2006) and \"The H Project\" (2005), a recording that raised awareness of the Hmong genocide in Laos.\n\nIn 2006, as a result of Hmong artists' increasing interest in the fashion industry, CHAT created the Fresh Traditions Fashion Show and program. This one-of-a-kind fashion event offered its all-Hmong roster of designers complete creative control. It also, however, presented them with a challenge: creating an outfit that incorporated fabrics and colors used in traditional Hmong clothing.\n\nOther CHAT programs and events launched during this period included CHAT Radio, which aired on KFAI between 2006 and 2010. The show provided information on the latest community arts news and showcased Hmong artists. Dawning<>\"Dab Neeg\" Theatre (DDNT) was a theatre program that ran from 2007 until 2009. In 2007 alone, DDNT produced the collectively created \"Hmong-land\"; staged May Lee Yang's \"Sia(b)\"; and toured \"Stir-Fried Pop Culture\" to schools and colleges.\n\nIn the fall of 2008 an influx of youth using the CHAT space as a creative hub prompted the creation of a new youth initiative. The Youth Leadership Group (YLG) targeted ages 15–19. The intense, year-long program used art as a vehicle to foster leadership skills and heighten students' expectations for success after high school. Youth met weekly to discuss critical issues affecting the Hmong community, plan arts campaigns, and present them to the public.\n\nIn 2014, the Hmong Arts & Music Festival began taking place during the July 4 weekend within Lao Family Community of Minnesota's Hmong Freedom Celebration and Sports Festival. In that year, the event drew over fifteen thousand attendees.\n\nIn 2015, many of CHAT's programs continue to enrich the St. Paul arts scene, as well as the Hmong and immigrant/refugee communities. The Youth Leadership Group has produced five original theater pieces since its creation. As of 2015, it organizes CHAT's quarterly Friday Night Lights open mic. Art Saves Us continues to provide free transportation and arts instruction to nearly two hundred youth annually. And Fresh Traditions is still the only U.S. fashion show to feature Hmong designers exclusively.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2817560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2817560", "title": "Champlevé", "text": "Champlevé\n\nChamplevé is an enamelling technique in the decorative arts, or an object made by that process, in which troughs or cells are carved, etched, die struck, or cast into the surface of a metal object, and filled with vitreous enamel. The piece is then fired until the enamel fuses, and when cooled the surface of the object is polished. The uncarved portions of the original surface remain visible as a frame for the enamel designs; typically they are gilded in medieval work. The name comes from the French for \"raised field\", \"field\" meaning background, though the technique in practice lowers the area to be enamelled rather than raising the rest of the surface. \n\nThe technique has been used since ancient times, though it is no longer among the most commonly used enamelling techniques. Champlevé is suited to the covering of relatively large areas, and to figurative images, although it was first prominently used in Celtic art for geometric designs. In Romanesque art its potential was fully used, decorating caskets, plaques and vessels, in Limoges enamel and that from other centres. \nChamplevé is distinguished from the technique of cloisonné enamel in which the troughs are created by soldering flat metal strips to the surface of the object. The difference between the techniques is analogous to the woodworking techniques of intarsia and marquetry. It differs from the \"basse-taille\" technique, which succeeded it in the highest quality Gothic work, in that the bottoms of the recesses for the enamel are rough, and so only opaque enamel colours are used. In \"basse-taille\" the recesses are modelled, and translucent enamels are used, for more subtle effects, as in the 14th century Parisian Royal Gold Cup.\n\n \nEnamel was first used on small pieces of jewellery, and has often disintegrated in ancient pieces that have been buried. Consistent and frequent use of champlevé technique is first seen in the La Tène style of early Celtic art in Europe, from the 3rd or 2nd century BC, where the predominant colour was a red, possibly intended as an imitation of red coral (as used on the Witham Shield), and the base was usually bronze. The \"Insular Celts\" of the British Isles made especially common use of the technique, seen as highlights on the relief decoration of the Battersea Shield and other pieces. However this was technically not true enamel in the usual sense of the word, as the glass was only heated until it became a soft paste before being pushed into place. This is sometimes informally known as \"sealing-wax\" enamelling, and may be described as \"glass inlay\" or similar terms. True enamelling technique, where glass paste is put into place and fired until it liquifies, was learnt from the Romans. The earliest literary description of enamel is from the Greek sophist Philostratus III, who wrote in his \"Icones\" (Bk I, 28), describing polychrome horse-harness: \"It is said that the barbarians in the Ocean pour these colours on heated bronze and that they adhere, become as hard as stone and preserve the designs that are made on them\". \nCeltic curvilinear styles were highly effective in enamel, and were used throughout the Roman period when they largely disappear in other media. The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan is a 2nd-century \"trulla\" with large enamel roundels in four colours of enamel, commissioned by or for Draco, a soldier, possibly a Greek, as a souvenir of his service on Hadrian's Wall. It is one of a group of similar enamelled vessels found in Britain and northern Gaul. Smaller items from similar contexts include brooches and other jewellery, and mounts for horse harness as described by Philostratus. Around the end of the Roman Empire new forms arose: the terminals of the increasingly fancy penannular brooches of the British Isles become decorated with champlevé, as do other fasteners and fittings, and the mounts of hanging bowls. These last have long puzzled art historians, as not only is their purpose unclear, but they are mostly found in Anglo-Saxon and Viking contexts, including three at Sutton Hoo, but their decoration uses predominantly Celtic motifs. One of the Sutton Hoo bowls had been repaired, but in a different, Germanic, style. Altogether, production of the different types of hanging bowls covers the period 400–1100. While the leading expert, Rupert Bruce-Mitford, sees the bowls as the products of \"Celtic\" workshops, perhaps often in Ireland, in the same period the use of large areas of champlevé in the most ornate Celtic brooches reduces, though gem-like enamel highlights, some in \"millefiori\", are still found. In Anglo-Saxon art, as in that of most of Europe and the Byzantine world, this was the period when cloisonné technique dominated enamelling.\n\nChamplevé is especially associated with Romanesque art, and many of the finest survivals of the style feature the technique. There was a great increase in use of the technique in several areas in the late 11th century, just as the Romanesque style matured. The immediate source of the style remains obscure; various exotic origins have been suggested, but the great expansion in the use of stained glass at the same period is probably connected. Copper or bronze bases were normally used, which were soft and easy to work, as well as relatively cheap, but as they discoloured in heat opaque enamels needed to be used. Blue was now the dominant colour, as in stained glass; the best blues in painting (whether on wall, panel or manuscript) were very expensive whereas in glass rich blues are easily obtainable. \n\nMosan and Limoges enamels are the most famous, and the figures carved in the copper plate display a superb sense of line. The Stavelot Triptych in New York is an example of the finest Mosan work, and the Becket Casket in London a fine early piece from Limoges. The names of several Mosan goldsmith-enamellers are known. Relief and fully modelled figures were also enamelled, and some metal bases formed by hammering into moulds. The Limoges production increased steadily in quantity, and by the Gothic period had declined in quality, but provided a fairly cheap product, especially of chasse caskets, produced on a semi-industrial scale and exported all over Europe. Spanish enamels, not easily distinguished from Limoges work, were also produced on a large scale. Mosan work was sometimes on gold or silver-gilt, but in Limoges and Spain gilt-copper is usual, and much Mosan work uses this too, as in the example illustrated. This example also shows the mixing of different colours and shades within the same cell, here used throughout the design in a complex manner, whereas in the Limoges examples below much less, and much simpler, use is made of this difficult technique. \nA similar technique was known as \"shippou-zogan\" in Japan, where it was considered a form of damascening.\n\n"}
{"id": "3602330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3602330", "title": "Cinema of Asia", "text": "Cinema of Asia\n\nAsian cinema refers to the film industries and films produced in the continent of Asia, and is also sometimes known as Eastern cinema. More commonly, however, it is most often used to refer to the cinema of Eastern, Southeastern and Southern Asia. West Asian cinema is sometimes classified as part of Middle Eastern cinema, along with the cinema of Egypt. The cinema of Central Asia is often grouped with the Middle East or, in the past, the cinema of the Soviet Union during the Soviet Central Asia era. North Asia is dominated by Siberian Russian cinema, and is thus considered part of European cinema.\n\nEast Asian cinema is typified by the cinema of Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea, including the Japanese anime industry and action films of Hong Kong. South Asian cinema is typified by the cinema of India (including Bollywood, South Indian, Bengali and Punjabi cinema), the cinema of Pakistan (including Punjabi and Urdu cinema), the cinema of Bangladesh (Bengali cinema), and the cinema of Nepal. Southeast Asian cinema is typified by the cinema of the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, and other Southeast Asian countries. The cinema of Central Asia and the southern Caucasus is typified by Iranian cinema and the cinema of Tajikistan. West Asian cinema is typified by Arab cinema, Iranian cinema, Israeli cinema, Jewish cinema, and Turkish cinema.\n\nA 5,200-year-old earthen bowl found in Shahr-i Sokhta, Iran, has five images of a goat painted along the sides. This is believed to be an example of early animation.\n\nMo-Ti, a Chinese philosopher \"circa\" 500 BC, pondered the phenomenon of inverted light from the outside world beaming through a small hole in the opposite wall in a darkened room. Shadow plays first appeared during the Han Dynasty and later gain popularity across Asia. Around 180 AD, Ting Huan (丁緩) created an elementary zoetrope in China.\n\nIn 1021, Alhazen, an Iraqi scientist, experimented with the same optical principle described by Mo-Ti, and wrote of the results in his \"Book of Optics\", which provided the first clear description and correct analysis of the \"camera obscura\". His lamp experiment, where several different light sources are arranged across a large area, was the first to successfully project an entire image from outdoors onto a screen indoors with the \"camera obscura\".\n\nThe first short films from Asia were produced during the 1890s. The first short films produced in Japan were \"Bake Jizo\" (\"Jizo the Spook\") and \"Shinin no Sosei\" (\"Resurrection of a Corpse\"), both from 1898. The first Indian short film was also produced in 1898, \"The Flower of Persia\", directed by Hiralal Sen.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Israeli silent movies were screened in sheds, cafes and other temporary structures. In 1905, Cafe Lorenz opened on Jaffa Road in the Jewish neighborhood of Neve Tzedek. From 1909, the Lorenz family began screening movies at the cafe. In 1925, the Kessem Cinema was housed there for a short time. The first East Asian feature film was Japan's \"The Life Story of Tasuke Shiobara\" (1912). It was followed by India's first feature-length silent film, the period piece drama \"Raja Harishchandra\" (1913), by Dadasaheb Phalke, considered the father of Indian cinema. By the next decade, the output of Indian cinema was an average of 27 films per year. On the other hand, in the Philippines, the first film produced and made in the Philippines was La Vida de Jose Rizal in 1912 by Edward Meyer Gross. José Nepomuceno, bought his first film equipment from Albert Yearsley and Edward Meyer Gross on May 15, 1917 and for the next two years, Nepomuceno practiced using the equipment in preparation for making the first locally produced feature film of the Philippines. The first locally produced film in the Philippines is Dalagang Bukid. The film was released with English, Spanish, and Tagalog subtitles. During its theatrical run, leading actress Atang de la Rama had to sing \"Nabasag ang Banga\" (a song which is a part of the film) for every screening of the film in Manila, along with three others playing a violin, a cornet, and a piano\n\nIn the 1920s, the newborn Soviet cinema was the most radically innovative. There, the craft of editing, especially, surged forward, going beyond its previous role in advancing a story. Sergei Eisenstein perfected the technique of so-called dialectical or intellectual montage, which strove to make non-linear, often violently clashing, images express ideas and provoke emotional and intellectual reactions in the viewer.\n\nJewish cinema, particularly the Yiddish theater of Ashkenazi Jews, made its mark from the 1930s onward. Over 100 films were made in Yiddish, although many are now lost. Prominent films included \"Shulamith\" (1931), the first Yiddish musical on film \"His Wife's Lover\" (1931), \"A Daughter of Her People\" (1932), the anti-Nazi film \"The Wandering Jew\" (1933), \"The Yiddish King Lear\" (1934), \"Shir Hashirim\" (1935), the biggest Yiddish film hit of all time \"Yidl Mitn Fidl\" (1936), \"Where Is My Child?\" (1937), \"Green Fields\" (1937), \"Dybuk\" (1937), \"The Singing Blacksmith\" (1938), \"Tevya\" (1939), \"Mirele Efros\" (1939), \"Lang ist der Weg\" (1948), and \"God, Man and Devil\" (1950). Additionally, the films of the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, and Woody Allen have left a lasting mark on cinema.\n\nSound films began being produced in Asia from the 1930s. Notable early talkies from the cinema of Japan included Kenji Mizoguchi's \"Sisters of the Gion\" (\"Gion no shimai\", 1936), \"Osaka Elegy\" (1936) and \"The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums\" (1939), along with Sadao Yamanaka's \"Humanity and Paper Balloons\" (1937) and Mikio Naruse's \"Wife, Be Like A Rose!\" (\"Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni\", 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S. However, with increasing censorship, the left-leaning tendency films of directors such as Daisuke Ito also began to come under attack. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature-length talkie was \"Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato\" (1930), which used the 'Mina Talkie System'. In 1935, Yasujirō Ozu also directed \"An Inn in Tokyo\", considered a precursor to the neorealism genre.\n\nArdeshir Irani released \"Alam Ara\", the first Indian talking film, on March 14, 1931. Following the inception of 'talkies' in India some film stars were highly sought after and earned comfortable incomes through acting. As sound technology advanced the 1930s saw the rise of music in Indian cinema with musicals such as \"Indra Sabha\" and \"Devi Devyani\" marking the beginning of song-and-dance in India's films. Studios emerged across major cities such as Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai as filmmaking became an established craft by 1935, exemplified by the success of \"Devdas\", which had managed to enthrall audiences nationwide.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II by the mid-1940s, the period from the late 1940s to the 1960s is considered the 'Golden Age' of Asian cinema. Many of the most critically acclaimed Asian films of all time were produced during this period, including Yasujirō Ozu's \"Late Spring\" (1949) and \"Tokyo Story\" (1953); Akira Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" (1950), \"Ikiru\" (1952), \"Seven Samurai\" (1954) and \"Throne of Blood\" (1957); Kenji Mizoguchi's \"The Life of Oharu\" (1952), \"Sansho the Bailiff\" (1954) and \"Ugetsu\" (1954); Satyajit Ray's \"The Apu Trilogy\" (1955–1959), \"The Music Room\" (1958) and \"Charulata\" (1964); Guru Dutt's \"Pyaasa\" (1957) and \"Kaagaz Ke Phool\" (1959); and Fei Mu's \"Spring in a Small Town\" (1948), Raj Kapoor's \"Awaara\" (1951), Mikio Naruse's \"Floating Clouds\" (1955), Mehboob Khan's \"Mother India\" (1957), and Ritwik Ghatak's \"Subarnarekha\" (1962).\n\nDuring Japanese cinema's 'Golden Age' of the 1950s and 1960s, successful films included \"Rashomon\" (1950), \"Seven Samurai\" (1954) and \"The Hidden Fortress\" (1958) by Akira Kurosawa, as well as Yasujirō Ozu's \"Tokyo Story\" (1953) and Ishirō Honda's \"Godzilla\" (1954). These films have had a profound influence on world cinema. In particular, Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai\" has been remade several times as Western films, such as \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960) and \"Battle Beyond the Stars\" (1980), and has also inspired several Bollywood films, such as \"Sholay\" (1975) and \"China Gate\" (1998). \"Rashomon\" was also remade as \"The Outrage\" (1964), and inspired films with \"Rashomon effect\" storytelling methods, such as \"Andha Naal\" (1954), \"The Usual Suspects\" (1995) and \"Hero\" (2002). \"The Hidden Fortress\" was also the inspiration behind George Lucas' \"Star Wars\" (1977). The Japanese New Wave began in the late 1950s and continued into the 1960s. Other famous Japanese filmmakers from this period include Kenji Mizoguchi, Mikio Naruse, Hiroshi Inagaki and Nagisa Oshima. Japanese cinema later became one of the main inspirations behind the New Hollywood movement of the 1960s to 1980s.\n\nDuring Indian cinema's 'Golden Age' of the 1950s and 1960s, it was producing 200 films annually, while Indian independent films gained greater recognition through international film festivals. One of the most famous was \"The Apu Trilogy\" (1955–1959) from critically acclaimed Bengali film director Satyajit Ray, whose films had a profound influence on world cinema, with directors such as Akira Kurosawa, Martin Scorsese, James Ivory, Abbas Kiarostami, Elia Kazan, François Truffaut, Steven Spielberg, Carlos Saura, Jean-Luc Godard, Isao Takahata, Gregory Nava, Ira Sachs, Wes Anderson and Danny Boyle being influenced by his cinematic style. According to Michael Sragow of \"The Atlantic Monthly\", the \"youthful coming-of-age dramas that have flooded art houses since the mid-fifties owe a tremendous debt to the Apu trilogy\". Subrata Mitra's cinematographic technique of bounce lighting also originates from \"The Apu Trilogy\". Satyajit Ray's success led to the establishment of the 'Parallel Cinema' movement, which was at its peak during the 1950s and 1960s. Other famous Indian filmmakers from this period include Guru Dutt, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Bimal Roy, K. Asif and Mehboob Khan.\n\nThe cinema of China experienced a 'Golden Age' in the late 1940s. In 1946, Cai Chusheng returned to Shanghai to revive the Lianhua name as the \"Lianhua Film Society.\" This in turn became Kunlun Studios which would go on to become one of the most important Chinese studios of the era, putting out the classics, \"Myriads of Lights\" (1948), \"The Spring River Flows East\" (1947), and \"Crows and Sparrows\" (1949). Wenhua's romantic drama \"Spring in a Small Town\" (1948), a film by director Fei Mu shortly prior to the revolution, is often regarded by Chinese film critics as one of the most important films in the history of Chinese cinema, with it being named by the Hong Kong Film Awards in 2004 as the greatest Chinese-language film ever made.\n\nThe cinema of Malaysia also had its 'Golden Age' in the post-war period of the 1950s and 1960s. The period saw the introduction of the studio system of filmmaking in Malaysia and influx of influences from Hollywood, the emerging cinema of Hong Kong, and particularly the Indian and Japanese film industries which were themselves experiencing a Golden Age.\n\nThe cinema of South Korea also experienced a 'Golden Age' in the late 1950s and 1960s, beginning with director Lee Kyu-hwan's tremendously successful remake of \"Chunhyang-jon\" (1955). That year also saw the release of \"Yangsan Province\" by the renowned director, Kim Ki-young, marking the beginning of his productive career. Both the quality and quantity of filmmaking had increased rapidly by the end of the 1950s. South Korean films, such as Lee Byeong-il's 1956 comedy \"Sijibganeun nal (The Wedding Day)\", had begun winning international awards. In contrast to the beginning of the 1950s, when only 5 movies were made per year, 111 films were produced in South Korea in 1959. The year 1960 saw the production of Kim Ki-young's \"The Housemaid\" and Yu Hyun-mok's \"Aimless Bullet\", both of which have been listed among the best Korean films ever made.\n\nThe late 1950s and 1960s was also a 'Golden Age' for Philippine cinema, with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in cinematic techniques among filmmakers. The studio system produced frenetic activity in the local film industry as many films were made annually and several local talents started to earn recognition abroad. One such honor was bestowed to Manuel Conde's immortal movie \"Gengis Khan\" (1950) when it was accepted for screening at the 13th Venice Film Festival. Other awards include Gerardo de Leon's \"Ifugao\" (1954) and Lamberto Avellana's \"Anak Dalita\". By the end of the decade Philippine cinema had developed into a major force in the Asian region. The premiere Philippine directors of the era included Gerardo de Leon, Gregorio Fernandez, Eddie Romero, Lamberto Avellana, and Cirio Santiago.\n\nThe 1960s is often cited as being the 'golden age' of Pakistani cinema. Many A-stars were introduced in this period in time and became legends on the silver screen. As black-and-white became obsolete, Pakistan saw the introduction of its first colour films, the first being Munshi Dil's \"Azra\" in early 1960s, Zahir Rehan's \"Sangam\" (first full-length coloured film) in 1964, and \"Mala\" (first coloured cinemascope film). In 1961, the political film \"Bombay Wallah\" was released, based on the city of Bombay in neighbouring India, in the wake of the growing tension between the nations. In 1962, \"Shaheed\" (\"Martyr\") pronounced the Palestine issue on the silver screen and became an instant hit, leading to a changing tide in the attitude of filmmakers.\n\nThe 1960s was the \"golden age\" of Cambodian cinema. Several production companies were started and more movie theaters were built throughout the country. More than 300 movies were made in Cambodia during the era. A number of Khmer language films were well received in its neougbouring countries at the time. Among the classic films from Cambodia during this period were \"Lea Haey Duong Dara\" (\"Goodbye Duong Dara\") and \"Pos Keng Kang\" (\"The Snake King's Wife\") by Tea Lim Kun and Sabbseth, and \"An Euil Srey An\" (\"Khmer After Angkor\") by Ly Bun Yim.\n\nThe range of Jewish entrepreneurs in the American film industry is considerable: Samuel Goldwyn, Louis B. Mayer, the Warner Brothers, David O. Selznick, Marcus Loew, and Adolph Zukor, Fox, and so forth. A more specifically Jewish sensibility can be seen in the films of the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, or Woody Allen; other examples of specifically Jewish films from the Hollywood film industry are the Barbra Streisand vehicle Yentl (1983), or John Frankenheimer's The Fixer (1968). In 1966, 2.6 million Israelis went to the cinema over 50 million times. From 1968, when television broadcasting began, theaters began to close down, first in the periphery, then in major cities. 330 standalone theaters were torn down or redesigned as multiplex theaters.\n\nBy the late '60s and early '70s, Japanese cinema had begun to become seriously affected by the collapse of the studio system. As Japanese cinema slipped into a period of relative low visibility, the cinema of Hong Kong entered a dramatic renaissance of its own, largely a side effect of the development of the \"wuxia\" blending of action, history, and spiritual concerns. Several major figures emerged in Hong Kong at this time - perhaps most famously, King Hu, whose 1966 \"Come Drink With Me\" was a key influence upon many subsequent Hong Kong cinematic developments. Shortly thereafter, the American-born Bruce Lee became a global icon in the 1970s.\n\nFrom 1969 onwards, the Iranian New Wave led to the growth of Iranian cinema, which would later go on to achieve international acclaim in the 1980s and 1990s. The most notable figures of the Iranian New Wave are Abbas Kiarostami, Jafar Panahi, Majid Majidi, Bahram Beizai, Darius Mehrjui, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Masoud Kimiay, Sohrab Shahid-Saless, Parviz Kimiavi, Samira Makhmalbaf, Amir Naderi, and Abolfazl Jalili. Features of New Wave Iranian film, in particular the works of Kiarostami, have been classified by some as postmodern.\n\nThe 1970s also saw the establishment of Bangladeshi cinema following the country's independence in 1971. One of the first films produced in Bangladesh after independence was \"Titash Ekti Nadir Naam\" (\"A River Called Titas\") in 1973 by acclaimed director Ritwik Ghatak, whose stature in Bengali cinema is comparable to that of Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen. Another great film of Bangladesh is Mita's 'Lathial' (The striker), were the best movies of the year of 1975. 'Lathial' got first National Award as the best film, and mita got first National Award as best director.\n\nIn the cinema of India, the 1970s saw a decline in 'Parallel Cinema' and the rise of commercial Hindi cinema in the form of enduring \"masala\" films, such as the Mumbai underworld film \"Deewaar\" (1975) and \"Curry Western\" movie \"Sholay\" (1975), which solidified Amitabh Bachchan's position as a lead actor. Commercial cinema further grew throughout the 1980s and the 1990s with the release of films such as \"Mr. India\" (1987), \"Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak\" (1988), \"Tezaab\" (1988), \"Chandni\" (1989), \"Maine Pyar Kiya\" (1989), \"Baazigar\" (1993), \"Darr\" (1993), \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" (1994) and \"Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge\" (1995).\n\nDuring the 1980s, Japanese cinema - aided by the rise of independent filmmaking and the spectacular success of anime - began to make something of an international comeback. Simultaneously, a new post-Mao Zedong generation of Chinese filmmakers began to gain global attention. Another group of filmmakers, centered around Edward Yang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, launched what has become known as the \"Taiwanese New Wave\".\n\nThe 1980s is also considered the Golden Age of Hong Kong action cinema. Jackie Chan reinvented the martial arts film genre with a new emphasis on elaborate and dangerous stunts and slapstick humour, beginning with \"Project A\" (1983). John Woo began the \"heroic bloodshed\" genre based on triads, beginning with \"A Better Tomorrow\" (1986). The Hong Kong New Wave also occurred during this period, led by filmmakers such as Tsui Hark.\n\nWith the post-1980 rise in popularity of East Asian cinema in the West, Western audiences are again becoming familiar with many of the industry's filmmakers and stars. A number of these key players, such as Chow Yun-fat and Zhang Ziyi, have \"crossed over\", working in Western films. Others have gained exposure through the international success of their films, though many more retain more of a \"cult\" appeal, finding a degree of Western success through DVD sales rather than cinema releases.\n\nIn the modern era, the success of Israeli and diaspora Jewish cinema can be observed in industry giants ranging from Michael Ovitz, Michael Eisner, Lew Wasserman, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg, and David Geffen. However, few of these ever focused on Jewish issues with the sometime exception of Spielberg. In the first decade of the 21st century, several Israeli films won awards in film festivals around the world. Prominent films of this period include \"Late Marriage\" (Dover Koshashvili), \"Broken Wings\", \"Walk on Water\" and \"Yossi & Jagger\" (Eytan Fox), \"Nina's Tragedies\", \"Campfire\" and \"Beaufort\" (Joseph Cedar), \"Or (My Treasure)\" (Keren Yedaya), \"Turn Left at the End of the World\" (Avi Nesher), \"The Band's Visit\" (Eran Kolirin) \"Waltz With Bashir\" (Ari Folman), and \"Ajami\". In 2011, Strangers No More won the Oscar for best Short Documentary.\n\n\n"}

City Theater produces and hosts theater, dance and music performances year-round and aims to, “foster an appreciation for the performing arts by using creative avenues to increase community involvement.”\n\nCity Theater is part of the Biddeford City Hall complex, designed by Maine architect John Calvin Stevens in 1895. The building is included on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a contributing element to the Biddeford Main Street Historic District.\n\nBiddeford's City Theater originally opened as an opera house in October 1860 at its present Main Street location as a part of the Biddeford City Hall complex. The opera house enjoyed a high level of popularity in the Biddeford and Southern Maine region until burning down December 30, 1894. Whether to rebuild the opera house was debated, the city eventually settled on rebuilding a more structurally sound opera house.\n\nArchitect John Calvin Stevens was chosen to design the new city hall and opera house, which opened January 20, 1896. The opera house again became a favorite site for cultural and entertainment attractions. Through to the 1920s it brought vaudeville, minstrel shows, illustrated songs, dramatic performances and even community pageants and plays to the Southern Maine community.\n\nThe introduction of talkies in 1928 began the transition from opera house to movie theater. In 1955, “improvements” to its interior were made, including panelling of the lobby and its staircase and addition poster displays and a cinemascope screen. The name of the opera house was at this time officially changed to Biddeford's City Theater.\n\nHowever, with the increased popularity of drive-ins and television, City Theater had closed its doors by 1963 and remained closed until 1978. In the interim, Biddeford's City Theater was used as a storage facility for the city and, at one point, a horse-shoe pit, complete with a pile of sand dumped in the orchestra pit. Ironically, also during this period, in 1973 Biddeford's City Theater was added to the National Register of Historical Places.\n\nIn 1977, the newly incorporated City Theater Associates launched a campaign to renovate and re-open the opera house. Thus, a year later, the internationally popular Norman Luboff Choir opened for Biddeford's City Theater's first performance season in nearly 50 years.\n\nThough great improvements were made to its interior during the re-opening, City Theater was still in great need of restoration. It was not until the 1990s, when City Theater celebrated its centennial, that the theater received a full restoration. Funding was provided by local, state and federal governments along with private donations from local businesses and individuals. A new marquee, re-stenciling of the lobby and house walls and ceilings and new sound and lighting were among the improvements made.\n\nCurrent renovations to Biddeford's City Theater include re-pointing the exterior brickwork and improving the stage floor and restrooms.\n\nCity Theater currently runs a year-round season of theater, music and dance performances. Additionally, the theater has recently added community theater and youth opera and developed an ongoing relationship with the University of New England.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "444636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=444636", "title": "Cleanth Brooks", "text": "Cleanth Brooks\n\nCleanth Brooks ( ; October 16, 1906 – May 10, 1994) was an American literary critic and professor. He is best known for his contributions to New Criticism in the mid-20th century and for revolutionizing the teaching of poetry in American higher education. His best-known works, \"\" (1947) and \"Modern Poetry and the Tradition\" (1939), argue for the centrality of ambiguity and paradox as a way of understanding poetry. With his writing, Brooks helped to formulate formalist criticism, emphasizing \"the interior life of a poem\" (Leitch 2001) and codifying the principles of close reading.\n\nBrooks was also the preeminent critic of Southern literature, writing classic texts on William Faulkner, and co-founder of the influential journal \"The Southern Review\" (Leitch 2001) with Robert Penn Warren.\n\nOn October 16, 1906, in Murray, Kentucky, Brooks was born to a Methodist minister, the Reverend Cleanth Brooks, Sr., and Bessie Lee Witherspoon Brooks (Leitch 2001). He was one of three children: Cleanth and William, natural born sons, and Murray Brooks, actually born Hewitt Witherspoon, whom Bessie Lee Witherspoon kidnapped from her brother Forrest Bedford Witherspoon as a young baby after the natural mother had died. She later was able to change his name to Murray Brooks and continued to raise him as her own, causing quite a rift in her own family and alienating herself from Cleanth and William. Cleanth mentioned on more than one occasion that she so doted on Murray (Hewitt) that she no longer had a relationship with Cleanth and William. Attending McTyeire School, a private academy, he received a classical education and went on to study at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he received his B.A. \"summa cum laude\" in 1928 (Leitch 2001). In 1928, Brooks received his M.A. from Tulane University and went on to study at Exeter College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar. He received his B.A. (first class) in 1931 and his B.Litt. the following year. Brooks then returned to the United States and from 1932 to 1947 was a professor of English at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge (Singh 1991). In 1934, he married Edith Amy Blanchord.\n\nDuring his studies at Vanderbilt, he met literary critics and future collaborators Robert Penn Warren, John Crowe Ransom, Andrew Lytle, and Donald Davidson (Singh 1991). Studying with Ransom and Warren, Brooks became involved in two significant literary movements: the Southern Agrarians and the Fugitives (Singh 1991). Brooks admitted to reading the Southern Agrarian manifesto, \"I'll Take My Stand\" (1930) \"over and over\" (qtd. in Leitch 2001). While he never argued for the movement's conservative Southern traditions, he \"learned a great deal\" (qtd. in Leitch 2001) and found the Agrarian position valuable and \"unobjectionable\" (qtd. in Leitch 2001): \"They asked that we consider what the good life is or ought to be\" (qtd. in Leitch 2001).\n\nThe Fugitive Movement similarly influenced Brooks' approach to criticism. The Fugitives, a group of Southern poets consisting of such influential writers as John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, Donald Davidson, and Robert Penn Warren, met Saturday evenings to read and discuss poetry written by members of the group (Singh 1991). The discussion was based on intensive readings and included considerations of a poem's form, structure, meter, rhyme scheme, and imagery (Singh 1991). This close reading formed the foundation on which the New Critical movement was based and helped shape Brooks' approach to criticism (Singh 1991).\n\nWhile attending the University of Oxford, Brooks continued his friendship with fellow Vanderbilt graduate and Rhodes Scholar, Robert Penn Warren (Leitch 2001). In 1934, Warren joined the English department at Louisiana State, leading Brooks and Warren to collaborate on many works of criticism and pedagogy. In 1935, Brooks and Warren founded \"The Southern Review\". Until 1942, they co-edited the journal, publishing works by many influential authors, including Eudora Welty, Kenneth Burke, and Ford Madox Ford. The journal was known for its criticism and creative writing, marking it as one of the leading journals of the time (Leitch 2001).\n\nIn addition, Brooks's and Warren's collaboration led to innovations in the teaching of poetry and literature. At Louisiana State University, prompted by their students' inability to interpret poetry, the two put together a booklet that modeled close reading through examples (Leitch 2001). The booklet was a success and laid the foundation for a number of best-selling textbooks: \"An Approach to Literature\" (1936), \"Understanding Poetry\" (1938), \"Understanding Fiction\" (1943), \"Modern Rhetoric\" (1949), and, in collaboration with Robert Heilman, \"Understanding Drama\" (1945). Brooks' two most influential works also came out of the success of the booklet: \"Modern Poetry and the Tradition\" (1939) and \"\" (1947) (Leitch 2001).\n\nFrom 1941 to 1975, Brooks held many academic positions and received a number of distinguished fellowships and honorary doctorates. In 1941, he worked as a visiting professor at the University of Texas, Austin. From 1947 to 1975, he was an English professor at Yale University, where he held the position of Gray Professor of Rhetoric and Gray Professor of Rhetoric Emeritus from 1960 until his retirement, except 1964 to 1966 (Singh 1991). His tenure at Yale was marked by ongoing research into Southern literature, which resulted in the publication of Brooks' studies of William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County (1963, 1978) (Leitch 2001). At Yale, he accepted honorary membership in Manuscript Society. In 1948, he was a fellow of the Kenyon School of English. From 1951 to 1953, he was a fellow of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. and was a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. During this time, he received the Guggenheim Fellowship and held it again in 1960. From 1963 to 1972, he was awarded honorary doctorates of literature from Upsala College, the University of Kentucky, the University of Exeter, Washington and Lee University, Saint Louis University, Tulane University, and Centenary College NJ and Oglethorpe University (Singh 1991).\n\nBrooks' other positions included working as a cultural attaché for the American embassy in London from 1964 to 1966. Further, he held memberships in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and the American Philosophical Society (Singh 1991).\n\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities selected Brooks for the 1985 Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities. He delivered the lecture both in Washington and at Tulane University in New Orleans, and it was subsequently included as \"Literature in a Technological Age\" in a collection of his essays.\n\nBrooks was the central figure of New Criticism, a movement that emphasized structural and textual analysis—close reading—over historical or biographical analysis. Brooks advocates close reading because, as he states in \"The Well Wrought Urn\", \"by making the closest examination of what the poem says as a poem\" (qtd. in Leitch 2001), a critic can effectively interpret and explicate the text. For him, the crux of New Criticism is that literary study be \"concerned primarily with the work itself\" (qtd. in Leitch 2001). In \"The Formalist Critics,\" Brooks offers \"some articles of faith\" (qtd. in Leitch 2001) to which he subscribes. These articles exemplify the tenets of New Criticism:\n\n\nNew Criticism involves examining a poem's \"technical elements, textual patterns, and incongruities\" (Leitch 2001) with a kind of scientific rigor and precision. From I. A. Richards' \"The Principles of Literary Criticism\" and \"Practical Criticism\", Brooks formulated guidelines for interpreting poetry (Leitch 2001). Brooks formulated these guidelines in reaction to ornamentalist theories of poetry, to the common practice of critics going outside the poem (to historical or biographical contexts), and his and Warren's frustration with trying to teach college students to analyze poetry and literature (Leitch 2001).\n\nBrooks and Warren were teaching using textbooks \"full of biographical facts and impressionistic criticism\" (Singh 1991). The textbooks failed to show how poetic language differed from the language of an editorial or a work of non-fiction. From this frustration, Brooks and Warren published \"Understanding Poetry\". In the book, the authors assert poetry should be taught as poetry, and the critic should resist reducing a poem to a simple paraphrase, explicating it through biographical or historical contexts, and interpreting it didactically (Singh 1991). For Brooks and Warren, paraphrase and biographical and historical background information is useful as a means of clarifying interpretation, but it should be used as means to an end (Singh 1991).\n\nBrooks took this notion of paraphrase and developed it further in his classic \"The Well Wrought Urn\". The book is a polemic against the tendency for critics to reduce a poem to a single narrative or didactic message. He describes summative, reductionist reading of poetry with a phrase still popular today: \"The Heresy of Paraphrase\" (Leitch 2001). In fact, he argued poetry serves no didactic purpose because producing some kind of statement would be counter to a poem's purpose. Brooks argues \"through irony, paradox, ambiguity and other rhetorical and poetic devices of his or her art, the poet works constantly to resist any reduction of the poem to a paraphrasable core, favoring the presentation of conflicting facets of theme and patterns of resolved stresses\" (Leitch 2001).\n\nIn addition to arguing against historical, biographical, and didactic readings of a poem, Brooks believed that a poem should not be criticized on the basis of its effect on the reader. In an essay called \"The Formalist Critics,\" he says that \"the formalist critic assumes an ideal reader: that is, instead of focusing on the varying spectrum of possible readings, he attempts to find a central point of reference from which he can focus upon the structure of the poem or novel\" (qtd. in Rivkin, 24). While he admits that it is problematic to assume such a reference point, he sees it as the only viable option. Since the other options would be either to give any reading equal status with any other reading, or to establish a group of \"'qualified' readers\" and use those as a range of standard interpretations. In the first case, a correct or \"standard\" reading would become impossible; in the second case, an ideal reader has still been assumed under the guise of multiple ideal readers (Rivkin 24). Thus, Brooks does not accept the idea of considering critics' emotional responses to works of literature as a legitimate approach to criticism. He says that \"a detailed description of my emotional state on reading certain works has little to do with indicating to an interested reader what the work is and how the parts of it are related\" (Rivkin 24). For Brooks, nearly everything a critic evaluates must come from within the text itself. This opinion is similar to that expressed by W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley in their famous essay \"The Affective Fallacy,\" in which they argue that a critic is \"a teacher or explicator of meanings,\" not a reporter of \"physiological experience\" in the reader (qtd. in Adams, 1029, 1027).\n\nBecause New Criticism isolated the text and excluded historical and biographical contexts, critics argued as early as 1942 that Brooks' approach to criticism was flawed for being overly narrow and for \"disabl[ing] any and all attempts to relate literary study to political, social, and cultural issues and debates\" (1350). His reputation suffered in the 1970s and 1980s when criticism of New Criticism increased. Brooks rebuffed the accusations that New Criticism has an \"antihistorical thrust\" (Leitch 2001) and a \"neglect of context\" (Leitch 2001). He insisted he was not excluding context because a poem possesses organic unity, and it is possible to derive a historical and biographical context from the language the poet uses (Singh 1991). He argues \"A poem by Donne or Marvell does not depend for its success on outside knowledge that we bring to it; it is richly ambiguous yet harmoniously orchestrated, coherent in its own special aesthetic terms\" (Leitch 2001).\n\nNew Criticism was accused by critics of having a contradictory nature. Brooks writes, on the one hand, \"the resistance which any good poem sets up against all attempts to paraphrase it\" (qtd. in Leitch 2001) is the result of the poet manipulating and warping language to create new meaning. On the other hand, he admonishes the unity and harmony in a poem's aesthetics. These seemingly contradictory forces in a poem create tension and paradoxical irony according to Brooks, but critics questioned whether irony leads to a poem's unity or undermines it (Leitch 2001). Poststructuralists in particular saw a poem's resistance and warped language as competing with its harmony and balance that Brooks celebrates (Leitch 2001).\n\nRonald Crane was particularly hostile to the views of Brooks and the other New Critics. In \"The Critical Monism of Cleanth Brooks,\" Crane writes that under Brooks's view of a poem's unity being achieved through the irony and paradox of the opposing forces it contains, the world's most perfect example of such an ironic poem would be Albert Einstein's equation E=mc, which equates matter and energy at a constant rate (Searle).\n\nIn his later years, Brooks criticized the poststructuralists for inviting subjectivity and relativism into their analysis, asserting \"each critic played with the text's language unmindful of aesthetic relevance and formal design\" (Leitch 2001). This approach to criticism, Brooks argued, \"denied the authority of the work\" (Leitch 2001).\n\n\"Understanding Poetry\" was an unparalleled success and remains \"a classic manual for the intellectual and imaginative skills required for the understanding of poetry\" (Singh 1991). Further, critics praise Brooks and Warren for \"introducing New Criticism with commendable clarity\" (Singh 1991) and for teaching students how to read and interpret poetry. Arthur Mizener commended Brooks and Warren for offering a new way of teaching poetry:\n\nFor us the real revolution in critical theory...was heralded by the publication, in 1938, of \"Understanding Poetry\"...for many of us who were preparing ourselves to teach English is those years...this book...came as a kind of revelation. It made sense because it opened up for us a way of talking about an actual poem in an actual classroom, and because the technique of focusing upon a poem as language rather than as history or biography or morality, gave a whole new meaning to and justification for the teaching of poetry (qtd. in Singh 1991).\n\nIn an obituary for Brooks, John W. Stevenson of Converse College notes Brooks \"redirect[ed] and revolutionize[d] the teaching of literature in American colleges and universities\" (1994). Further, Stevenson admits Brooks was \"the person who brought excitement and passion to the study of literature\" (1994) and \"whose work...became the model for a whole profession\" (1994).\n\nAlong with New Criticism, Brooks' studies of Faulkner, Southern literature, and T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\" (appearing in \"Modern Poetry and the Tradition\") remain classic texts. Mark Royden Winchell calls Brooks' text on Faulkner \"the best book yet on the works of William Faulkner\" (1996). Eliot himself commended Brooks in a letter for Brooks' critique of \"The Waste Land\" (Singh 1991). Further, Winchell praises Brooks for \"help[ing] invent the modern literary quarterly\" (1996) through the success of \"The Southern Review\".\n\nAs testament to Brooks' influence, fellow critic and former teacher John Crowe Ransom calls Brooks \"the most forceful and influential critic of poetry that we have\" (qtd. in Singh 1991). Elsewhere, Ransom has even gone so far as to describe Brooks as a \"spell binder\" (qtd. in Singh 1991).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

If a product contains fewer parts it will take less time to assemble, thereby reducing assembly costs. In addition, if the parts are provided with features which make it easier to grasp, move, orient and insert them, this will also reduce assembly time and assembly costs. The reduction of the number of parts in an assembly has the added benefit of generally reducing the total cost of parts in the assembly. This is usually where the major cost benefits of the application of design for assembly occur.\n\nDesign for assembly can take different forms. In the 1960s and 1970s various rules and recommendations were proposed in order to help designers consider assembly problems during the design process. Many of these rules and recommendations were presented together with practical examples showing how assembly difficulty could be improved. However, it was not until the 1970s that numerical evaluation methods were developed to allow design for assembly studies to be carried out on existing and proposed designs.\n\nThe first evaluation method was developed at Hitachi and was called the Assembly Evaluation Method (AEM). This method is based on the principle of \"one motion for one part.\" For more complicated motions, a point-loss standard is used and the ease of assembly of the whole product is evaluated by subtracting points lost. The method was originally developed in order to rate assemblies for ease of automatic assembly.\n\nStarting in 1977, Geoff Boothroyd, supported by an NSF grant at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, developed the Design for Assembly method (DFA), which could be used to estimate the time for manual assembly of a product and the cost of assembling the product on an automatic assembly machine. Recognizing that the most important factor in reducing assembly costs was the minimization of the number of separate parts in a product, he introduced three simple criteria which could be used to determine theoretically whether any of the parts in the product could be eliminated or combined with other parts. These criteria, together with tables relating assembly time to various design factors influencing part grasping, orientation and insertion, could be used to estimate total assembly time and to rate the quality of a product design from an assembly viewpoint. For automatic assembly, tables of factors could be used to estimate the cost of automatic feeding and orienting and automatic insertion of the parts on an assembly machine.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, variations of the AEM and DFA methods have been proposed, namely: the GE Hitachi method which is based on the AEM and DFA; the Lucas method, the Westinghouse method and several others which were based on the original DFA method. All methods are now referred to as \"design for assembly\" methods.\n\nMost products are assembled manually and the original DFA method for manual assembly is the most widely used method and has had the greatest industrial impact throughout the world.\n\nThe DFA method, like the AEM method, was originally made available in the form of a handbook where the user would enter data on worksheets to obtain a rating for the ease of assembly of a product. Starting in 1981, Geoffrey Boothroyd and Peter Dewhurst developed a computerized version of the DFA method which allowed its implementation in a broad range of companies. For this work they were presented with many awards including the National Medal of Technology. There are many published examples of significant savings obtained through the application of DFA. For example, in 1981, Sidney Liebson, manager of manufacturing engineering for Xerox, estimated that his company would save hundreds of millions of dollars through the application of DFA. In 1988, Ford Motor Company credited the software with overall savings approaching $1 billion. In many companies DFA is a corporate requirement and DFA software is continually being adopted by companies attempting to obtain greater control over their manufacturing costs. There are many key principles in design for assembly.\n\nTwo notable examples of good design for assembly are the Sony Walkman and the Swatch watch. Both were designed for fully automated assembly. The Walkman line was designed for \"vertical assembly\", in which parts are inserted in straight-down moves only. The Sony SMART assembly system, used to assemble Walkman-type products, is a robotic system for assembling small devices designed for vertical assembly.\n\nThe IBM Proprinter used design for automated assembly (DFAA) rules.\nThese DFAA rules help design a product that can be assembled automatically by robots, but they are useful even with products assembled by manual assembly.\n\n\nFor more information on Design for Assembly and the subject of Design for Manufacture and Assembly see:\n\n"}

The European Film Gateway gives access to images, textual materials, and moving images. The vast contents include film stills, set photos, posters, set drawings, portrait photographs, scripts, correspondences, film censorship and visa rulings, out-of-print books, film programs and reviews, as well as newsreels, documentaries, commercials, and feature films. The portal facilitates access to the archives which hold the original materials.\n\nThe online portal European Film Gateway is the main outcome of the EU-funded project “EFG – European Film Gateway”. Working with 22 partner organizations from 16 European countries, EFG addressed issues for access to digital content, namely, technical and semantic interoperability, metadata standards, practices for rights’ clearance, and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) management of cinematographic works. The project was coordinated by the Deutsches Filminstitut (DIF) and funded by the European Commission under eContentplus, the Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP). It ran from September 2008 to August 2011 was supported by the Association des Cinematheques Europeennes (ACE) as well as the EDL Foundation.\n\nAll metadata provided by the contributing archives is stored centrally in the EFG metadata repository, which was developed in the EFG project. The EFG metadata model is mostly based on the EN 15907: Film identification - Enhancing interoperability of metadata - Element sets and structures standard. Also other models, such as FRBR as well as WPE defined by the OLAC have been considered during establishing the EFG data model.\n\nThe multilingual and non-standardised metadata delivered by content providers is harmonised and cleaned before it is ingested in the EFG system. In contrast to the metadata, which is stored centrally, the digital objects remain on individual online platforms run by the archives. Deep links refer the user directly to the objects.\n\nThe EFG implemented the technology developed by the Digital Repository Infrastructure Vision for European Research (DRIVER) project. This open service system enables the creation and maintenance of infrastructures capable of supporting the construction of Information Spaces of digital objects collected from various archives. It also permits the creation of service-oriented applications where services can be shared and re-used in other contexts.\n\nThe EFG project assessed copyright regulations and legal framework for online use of archival contents through research reports on open content models as well as working with organisations engaged with online publishing of copyrighted archival film material. EFG provided individual network partners with tools for consultations with representatives from rights owners’ and producers’ organisations in order to make the archival material available online.\n\nEFG1914 is the follow-up project of EFG. It began in February 2012 and runs for two years. Coinciding with the centenary of the First World War, EFG1914 focuses on the digitization of films and other documents from and relating to the war, making the contents available through the European Film Gateway and Europeana. Like EFG, it is funded by the European Commission and coordinated by Deutsches Filminstitut. The project consortium consists of 26 partners, 21 of which are film archives.\n\nTo date, only about 20% of the silent film production of the time remains safe-guarded in the archives and was largely unavailable to the public. EFG1914 significantly simplifies access to these films, covering various fields, from newsreels to documentary, fiction, and propaganda films.

It is a sequel to \"Father of the Bride\" and a loose remake of the 1951 film \"Father's Little Dividend\", the sequel to the original \"Father of the Bride\" film released in 1950.\n\nThe film begins 4 years after the events of the first one, with George Banks telling the audience he is ready for the empty nest he'll shortly receive with all of his children grown up. Shortly thereafter, Annie tells the family that she's pregnant, and George begins to mildly panic, insisting he is too young to be a grandfather. He has his assistant make a list of people who are older than him, dyes his hair brown, and decides he and Nina should sell the home their children have grown up in if one more thing goes wrong with it.\n\nTermites strike the house two weeks later. George puts the house on the market without telling Nina, and sells it to the Habibs. At dinner, after a discussion on whether the baby's last name will be hyphenated or not, George reveals the house has been sold. Nina is livid, as she and George have to be out in 10 days and have no place to go. Having no place to go, the Banks stay at the mansion owned by Bryan's parents. As the MacKenzies are on a cruise in the Caribbean, the Banks have to deal with their vicious Dobermans, much to the chagrin of George, who is still obviously paranoid from a previous mishap with them. Nina begins experiencing symptoms that bring up the concern of menopause. After visiting the doctor the following day, they are given the opposite news: Nina is pregnant, too. \n\nNot long after, they have a chance meeting with Franck, Annie's wedding planner, who is elated at both women expecting. George switches gears, now believing he is too old to be a father again. His feelings come to a head when he and Nina go to Annie's and Bryan's house to announce their news. Nina brings his insensitivity to light and tells him not to come home. As an apology, George reluctantly hires Franck to do the baby shower. As they are driving home, Nina and George have differing perspectives on the prospect of becoming new parents again. Both express how strange it will be, but begin to welcome the change.\n\nOne day when George is out, he notices that the street to their old house is blocked off and sees a demolition crew with a wrecking ball at the house and learns that Mr. Habib plans to demolish it. An upset George runs in and tries to stop them as the wrecking ball is about to slam into the house. He pleads with Mr. Habib not to tear down the house since he is going to be a father again, as there is great sentimental value to it. He realizes that if he's going to have another child, he wants to raise him/her in the house his family grew up in. When George offers to buy the house back, Habib agrees on the condition that George pay him $100,000 up front. Although reluctant to pay that money, he gives in when Mr. Habib is about to send in the wrecking ball. The Banks then move back into their house, right as Bryan is called away to an emergency meeting in Japan.\n\nMeanwhile, Nina and Annie are moving along in their simultaneous pregnancies and need around the clock care from George. Matty takes over when his father George is away at work. Franck turns simple redecoration of Nina and George's new baby's nursery into a full-scale renovation/addition, which he affectionately calls, 'the baby's suite'. Eventually, all the stress and nights of sleep deprivation wear George out. When 'the baby's suite' is revealed, Franck offers George some sleeping pills from his native country called 'Vatsnik' after George tells him that he has not been getting enough sleep. George unknowingly takes too high of a dosage and suddenly passes out during dinner. The family becomes worried, which is only increased when Annie finally goes into labor.\n\nFranck takes over the role of driving the family to the hospital with a barely coherent George in tow. After being mistaken for a patient in need of a prostate exam, George finally regains full consciousness and goes to see Nina and Annie when Nina goes into labor. George is initially cynical about the female obstetrician who fills in because their own is unavailable. Despite wanting his grandchild to be delivered by the same doctor who delivered his children, George comes to terms with the arrangement. Bryan soon returns to be with Annie, who gives birth to a baby boy, while Nina gives birth to a baby girl, named George and Megan respectively. George finishes telling the story about Nina and Annie's pregnancies. Bryan and Annie then move to Boston with baby George, since Annie took a job there. The film concludes with George standing on the road in front of his house, admiring it with Megan by his side. As he completes the story, he begins walking up the driveway, telling Megan about all the basketball tricks George will teach her.\n\n\nThe film received a mixed critical response from fans and critics alike, and currently holds a 48% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe film debuted at No. 2.\n\nAlan Silvestri returned to score the music for the film. The officially released soundtrack album contains the following 15 tracks:\n\n\nIn 1996, Meyers confirmed that she and Shyer were planning a third installment in the \"Father of the Bride\" series, which would \"have their characters confronting serious problems in their relationship – but ending up with a stronger bond than ever\" - though ultimately a sequel failed to materialize. In 2014, reports arose regarding a gay marriage themed \"Father of the Bride 3\" emerged, reportedy again directed by Shyer, which was said to focus on a 29-year-old Matty Banks after he announces his engagement to the son of a US Navy Seal. Steve Martin denied the rumors on his social media stating that he had neither seen a script, nor been offered the role.\n\n"}

Since the saga survives in different versions, it is common to speak of it in the plural, as \"Guðmundar sögur\" (rather than \"Guðmundar saga\").\n\nThe first version, known as the \"Prestssaga Guðmundar byskups\", was composed soon after Guðmundur‘s death in 1237, possibly at the instigation of abbot Lambkárr Þorgilsson (d. 1249). It recounts the bishop‘s life as a young man and priest but stops abruptly during a description of Guðmundr's voyage to Norway for consecration in 1202. It may therefore be unfinished.

{"id": "3175911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3175911", "title": "Hand-colouring of photographs", "text": "Hand-colouring of photographs\n\nHand-colouring (or hand-coloring) refers to any method of manually adding colour to a black-and-white photograph, generally either to heighten the realism of the photograph or for artistic purposes. Hand-colouring is also known as hand painting or overpainting.\n\nTypically, watercolours, oils, crayons or pastels, and other paints or dyes are applied to the image surface using brushes, fingers, cotton swabs or airbrushes. Hand-coloured photographs were most popular in the mid- to late-19th century before the invention of colour photography and some firms specialised in producing hand-coloured photographs.\n\nMonochrome (black and white) photography was first exemplified by the daguerreotype in 1839 and later improved by other methods including: calotype, ambrotype, tintype, albumen print and gelatin silver print. The majority of photography remained monochrome until the mid-20th century, although experiments were producing colour photography as early as 1855 and some photographic processes produced images with an inherent overall colour like the blue of cyanotypes.\n\nIn an attempt to create more realistic images, photographers and artists would hand-colour monochrome photographs. \nThe first hand-coloured daguerreotypes are attributed to Swiss painter and printmaker Johann Baptist Isenring, who used a mixture of gum arabic and pigments to colour daguerreotypes soon after their invention in 1839. Coloured powder was fixed on the delicate surface of the daguerreotype by the application of heat. Variations of this technique were patented in England by Richard Beard in 1842 and in France by Étienne Lecchi in 1842 and Léotard de Leuze in 1845. Later, hand-colouring was used with successive photographic innovations, from albumen and gelatin silver prints to lantern slides and transparency photography.\n\nParallel efforts to produce coloured photographic images affected the popularity of hand-colouring. In 1842 Daniel Davis Jr. patented a method for colouring daguerreotypes through electroplating, and his work was refined by Warren Thompson the following year. The results of the work of Davis and Thompson were only partially successful in creating colour photographs and the electroplating method was soon abandoned. In 1850 Levi L. Hill announced his invention of a process of daguerreotyping in natural colours in his \"Treatise on Daguerreotype\". Sales of conventional uncoloured and hand-coloured daguerreotypes fell in anticipation of this new technology. Hill delayed publication of the details of his process for several years, however, and his claims soon came to be considered fraudulent. When he finally did publish his treatise in 1856, the process – whether bona fide or not – was certainly impractical and dangerous.\n\nHand-colouring remained the easiest and most effective method to produce full-colour photographic images until the mid-20th century when American Kodak introduced Kodachrome colour film.\n\nThough the hand-colouring of photographs was introduced in Europe, the technique gained considerable popularity in Japan, where the practice became a respected and refined art form beginning in the 1860s. It is possible that photographer Charles Parker and his artist partner William Parke Andrew were the first to produce such works in Japan, but the first to consistently employ hand-colouring in the country were the photographer Felice Beato and his partner, \"The Illustrated London News\" artist and colourist Charles Wirgman. In Beato's studio the refined skills of Japanese watercolourists and woodblock printmakers were successfully applied to European photography, as evidenced in Beato's volume of hand-coloured portraits, \"Native Types\".\n\nAnother notable early photographer in Japan to use hand-colouring was Yokoyama Matsusaburō. Yokoyama had trained as a painter and lithographer as well as a photographer, and he took advantage of his extensive repertoire of skills and techniques to create what he called \"shashin abura-e\" (写真油絵) or \"photographic oil paintings\", in which the paper support of a photograph was cut away and oil paints then applied to the remaining emulsion.\n\nLater practitioners of hand-colouring in Japan included the firm of Stillfried & Andersen, which acquired Beato's studio in 1877 and hand-coloured many of his negatives in addition to its own. Austrian Baron Raimund von Stillfried und Ratenitz, trained Japanese photographer and colorist Kusakabe Kimbei, and together they created hand-coloured images of Japanese daily life that were very popular as souvenirs. Hand-coloured photographs were also produced by Kusakabe Kimbei, Tamamura Kozaburō, Adolfo Farsari, Uchida Kuichi, Ogawa Kazumasa and others. Many high-quality hand-coloured photographs continued to be made in Japan well into the 20th century.\n\nThe so-called golden age of hand-coloured photography in the western hemisphere occurred between 1900 and 1940. The increased demand for hand-coloured landscape photography at the beginning of the 20th century is attributed to the work of Wallace Nutting. Nutting, a New England minister, pursued hand-coloured landscape photography as a hobby until 1904, when he opened a professional studio. He spent the next 35 years creating hand-coloured photographs, and became the best-selling hand-coloured photographer of all time.\n\nBetween 1915 and 1925 hand-coloured photographs were popular among the middle classes in the United States, Canada, Bermuda and the Bahamas as affordable and stylish wedding gifts, shower gifts, holiday gifts, friendship gifts, and vacation souvenirs. With the start of the Great Depression in 1929, and the subsequent decrease in the numbers of the middle class, sales of hand-coloured photographs sharply diminished.\n\nDespite their downturn in popularity, skilled photographers continued to create beautifully hand-coloured photographs. Hans Bellmer's hand-coloured photographs of his own doll sculptures from the 1930s provide an example of continued hand-colouring of photographs in Europe during this time. In Poland, the Monidło is an example of popular hand-coloured wedding photographs.\n\nAnother hand-colour photographer, Luis Márquez (1899–1978), was the official photographer for and art adviser of the Mexican Pavilion at the 1939-40 World’s Fair. In 1937 he presented Texas Governor James V. Allred a collection of hand-coloured photographs. The National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City has an extensive Luis Márquez photographic archive, as does the University of Houston in Texas.\n\nBy the 1950s, the availability of colour film all but stopped the production of hand-coloured photographs. The upsurge in popularity of antiques and collectibles in the 1960s, however, increased interest in hand-coloured photographs. Since about 1970 there has been something of a revival of hand-colouring, as seen in the work of such artist-photographers as Elizabeth Lennard, Jan Saudek, Kathy Vargas, and Rita Dibert. Robert Rauschenberg's and others' use of combined photographic and painting media in their art represents a precursor to this revival.\n\nIn spite of the availability of high-quality colour processes, hand-coloured photographs (often combined with sepia toning) are still popular for aesthetic reasons and because the pigments used have great permanence. In many countries where colour film was rare or expensive, or where colour processing was unavailable, hand-colouring continued to be used and sometimes preferred into the 1980s. More recently, digital image processing has been used – particularly in advertising – to recreate the appearance and effects of hand-colouring. Colourisation is now available to the amateur photographer using image manipulation software such as Adobe Photoshop.\n\nBasic dyes are used in the hand-colouring of photographs. Dyes are soluble colour substance, either natural or synthetic, in an aqueous solution, as opposed to pigments which are generally insoluble colour substance in an aqueous suspension. Aniline dyes, the first synthetically produced dyes originally used for the dyeing of textiles, were first used to dye albumen prints and glass transparency photographs in Germany in the 1860s. When hand-colouring with dyes, a weak solution of dye in water is preferred, and colours are often built up with repeated washes rather than being applied all at once. The approach is to \"stain\" or \"dye\" the print rather than to \"paint\" it, as too much paint will obscure photographic details. Blotting paper is used to control the amount of dye on the surface by absorbing any excess.\n\nWatercolour paint has the virtue of being more permanent than dyes, but is less transparent and so more likely to obscure details. Hand-colouring with watercolours requires the use of a medium to prevent the colours from drying with a dull and lifeless finish. Before the paint can be applied, the surface of the print must be primed so that the colours are not repelled. This often includes prepping the print with a thin coating of shellac, then adding grit before colouring. Watercolour paint used in photographic hand-colouring consists of four ingredients: pigments (natural or synthetic), a binder (traditionally arabic gum), additives to improve plasticity (such as glycerine), and a solvent to dilute the paint (i.e. water) that evaporates when the paint dries. The paint is typically applied to prints using a soft brush. Watercolours often \"leave a darker edge of color at the boundaries of the painted area.\" Since different pigments have varying degrees of transparency, the choice of colours must be considered carefully. More transparent pigments are preferred, since they ensure greater visibility of the photographic image.\n\nOil paint contains particles of pigment applied using a drying oil, such as linseed oil. The conventions and techniques of using oils demands a knowledge of drawing and painting, so it is often used in professional practice. It is necessary to size the print first to prevent absorption of the colours into the paper. In the past, photographic lantern slides were often coloured by the manufacturer, though sometimes by the user, with variable results. Usually, oil colours were used for such slides, though in the collodion era – from 1848 to the end of the 19th century – sometimes watercolours were used as well.\n\nThe use of crayon or pastel sticks of ground pigments in various levels of saturation is also considered a highly skilled colourist's domain, as it requires knowledge of drawing techniques. Like oils, crayons and pastels generally obscure the original photograph, which produces portraits more akin to traditional paintings. Charcoal and coloured pencils are also used in hand-colouring of photographs and the terms crayon, pastel, charcoal, and pencil were often used interchangeably by colourists.\n\nHand-coloured photographs sometimes include the combined use of dyes, water-colours, oils, and other pigments to create varying effects on the printed image. Regardless of which medium is used, the main tools to apply colour are the brush and fingertip. Often the dabbing finger is covered to ensure that no fingerprints are left on the image.\n\nIn general, the preservation of hand-coloured photographs is similar to that of colour and monochrome photography. Optimal storage conditions include an environmentally controlled climate with low relative humidity (approximately 30-40% RH), temperatures under 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), and a low concentration of particulate pollution, such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and ozone. The storage area must also be clean and free of pests and mould. Because hand-coloured photographs, like colour photographs, are more sensitive to light and UV radiation, storage should be in a dark location. The storage area should be secure and monitored for internal threats – such as change in temperature or humidity due to HVAC malfunction, as well as external threats, such as theft or natural disaster. A disaster plan should be created and maintained for all materials.\n\nWhen handling cased photographs such as daguerreotypes, albumen prints, and tintypes, especially ones that have been hand-coloured, caution is required. They are fragile and even minimal efforts to clean them can irreparably damage the image. Hand-coloured cased photographs should be stored horizontally, in a single layer, preferably faced down. Cases can be wrapped with alkaline or buffered tissue paper. If the photograph has become separated from its case, a mat and backing board can be cut from alkaline buffered museum board. The mat is placed between the image and a newly cut glass plate while the backing board supports the image from behind. This \"sandwich\" is then sealed with Filmoplast tape. Commercial glass cleaners should not be used on new glass plates. Loose hand-coloured tintypes can be placed between mat boards. If bent, no attempt should be made to straighten them as this could cause the emulsion to crack and/or lift.\n\nIdeally, all photographic prints should be stored horizontally, although prints under 11\"x14\" and on stable mounts can be safely stored vertically. Prints should also be stored away from light and water sources in acid-free, lignin-free boxes manufactured using International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standards 14523 and 10214. Storage materials should also pass the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Photographic Activity Test (PAT), or similar standards, to ensure archival quality. If a photograph exhibits flaking or chipping emulsion it should not be stored in a plastic enclosure as static electricity could further damage the image. Clean cotton gloves should be worn when handling photographs to prevent skin oils and salts from damaging the surfaces.\n\nIn some cases it may be necessary to contact a professional conservator. In the United States, the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC) provides a Find a Conservator tool that helps identify local conservation services. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Conservation Register provides a similar tool that searches by specialization, business, and surname. To locate other conservation services internationally, Conservation OnLine (CoOL) Resources for Conservation Professionals provides a tool that searches by country.\n\nDyes and watercolours require similar preservation measures when applied to hand-coloured photographs. Like the photographs themselves, watercolours and dyes applied by hand to photographs are susceptible to light damage and must be housed in dark storage or displayed under dim, indirect light. Common particulate pollutants can cause watercolour pigments to fade, but the paint surface can be cleaned by lightly dusting with a soft brush to remove dirt.\n\nOil paint was often applied to tintypes, daguerreotypes, and ambrotypes. As with all photographs, the materials respond negatively to direct light sources, which can cause pigments to fade and darken, and frequent changes in relative humidity and temperature, which can cause the oil paint to crack. For photographs with substantial damage, the expertise of an oil paintings conservator might be required for treatment.\nCrayon and pastel hand-coloured photographs have a powdery surface which must be protected for preservation purposes. Historically, crayon and pastel coloured photographs were sold in a frame under a protective layer of glass, which was often successful in reducing the amount of handling and smudging of the photograph surface. Any conservation work on crayon or pastel colour-photographs must retain these original frames and original glass to maintain the authenticity and value of the object. If the photograph is separated from its original enclosure, it can be stored in an archival quality folder until it is framed or cased.\n\nIn the United States, many commercially sold, hand-coloured photographs were packaged and framed for retail sale. Early 20th century hand-coloured photographs were often mounted on mat-board, placed behind a glass frame, and backed by wood panel slats, cardboard, or heavy paperboard. A backing sheet was often glued to the back of the mat-board. Unfortunately, the paper products produced and used during the late-19th and early-20th centuries are highly acidic and will cause yellowing, brittling and degradation of hand-coloured photographs. Metallic inclusions in the paper can also oxidize which may be the cause of foxing in paper materials. Wood panel slats will also off-gas causing further degradation of the photographs.\n\nSimple conservation of these fragile materials can be carried out by the adventurous amateur. A hand-coloured photograph should be removed from the frame, retaining any original screws or nails holding the frame together. Wood panels, acidic cardboard slats, and acidic backing paper can be removed from the frame and mat-board and discarded, retaining any identifying information such as stamps or writing on the backing paper. The mat-board on which the photograph is mounted, even though acidic in nature, cannot be removed and replaced due to the intrinsic value of this original mounting. Often the artist's signature and the title of the photograph are inscribed on the mat-board. The best preservation method to promote limited degradation is to store the photograph in a dry environment with low temperature, low relative humidity, and low light. The hand-coloured photograph should be replaced in its original frame, held in place with archival quality acid-free paper paperboard, and closed with the original nails or screws.\n\nHand-colouring should be distinguished from \"tinting\", \"toning\", \"retouching\", and \"crystoleum\".\n\n\n\n"}

It centres on the relationship between Rachel (Perabo) and Luce (Headey), who meet on Rachel's wedding day.\n\nThe film takes its title from the first line of the song \"Happy Together\". Writer and director Parker reveals on the DVD audio commentary that the film was originally titled \"Click\", after the French term for love at first sight, but conflicts with the 2006 Adam Sandler film \"Click\" necessitated the name change.\n\nThe film opens on Rachel (Piper Perabo) and Hector's (Matthew Goode) wedding day in North London, England. Rachel's bossy and overbearing mother, Tess (Celia Imrie), is in charge of planning the wedding. Rachel's dazed father Ned (Anthony Head) and her much younger sister Henrietta are supportive. Prior to Rachel arriving and the ceremony beginning, flower shop owner Luce (Lena Headey) who was contracted by Tess as the wedding florist, and Henrietta are rushing along while chatting with Hector and Cooper \"Coop\" (Darren Boyd). Luce answers Henrietta's trick question which makes Henrietta take an immediate liking to her, and she asks if Luce can sit by her during the wedding. As they await arrival of the bride, Henrietta confides to Luce that she is nicknamed \"H\" because, supposedly, her mother exclaimed \"Jesus H. Christ!\" upon discovering she was pregnant. Rachel arrives with her father and the ceremony begins. As Rachel is walking down the aisle, her eyes wander and she makes eye contact with Luce. It is apparent that a connection between them has been made as their eyes meet. Rachel looks away, then quickly back, but Luce is gone. The ceremony continues according to plan, and Rachel and Hector marry. At the reception afterwards, Luce introduces herself to Rachel as the one who did the flowers as she is about to get punch. Rachel nervously blocks Luce's attempt to get a drink, and when she questions why she can't have any, Rachel reveals that her wedding ring accidentally fell in. The two share a moment together, but it is over after Luce fishes the ring out of the punch bowl and goes on her way.\n\nSome time later, Rachel goes to Luce's shop and invites her to dinner with Hector and, unknown to Luce, Cooper, a perennial bachelor and self-professed Lothario. Rachel has planned to set up Luce with Coop, while Luce confides to Heck moments before Coop arrives that she's a lesbian. Heck takes this news in stride and is bemused as Coop is undeterred in his attempts to seduce Luce. During the meal, when Coop starts bragging, Luce espouses she believes in love at first sight, while Rachel says it takes time to find the right person. Later on that night, Rachel and Luce share a moment together on the balcony as it rains.\n\nThe next day while grocery shopping, Heck and Rachel run into Luce and a woman friend, Edie. Heck then tells Rachel that Luce is gay. Heck inquires as to the relationship of Luce and Edie, but they assure Rachel and him that nothing is going on. Edie says Luce \"loves another\".\n\nIt becomes apparent that Rachel is trying to avoid Luce when she spots her one night. When Heck has to work long hours at his unsatisfying job, he sets Luce and Rachel up to spend time together as friends, despite Rachel's reluctance at the time. The two spend an evening together, visiting a football match and an arcade, which becomes the setting for a Dance Dance Revolution sequence. At the end of the night, Luce walks Rachel back to her flat. Their goodbye grows awkward from tension, then Rachel leans forward to kiss Luce, but withdraws at the last moment and goes inside her home.\n\nOver the next few days, Rachel continues to resist her growing attraction to Luce in an effort to remain loyal to Heck. For her part, Luce has no wish to break up a committed couple. Unable to deny what she is feeling, Rachel eventually confronts Luce directly at her flower shop. She tells Luce that a romance between them cannot happen, turns to leave, and returns seconds later to kiss Luce in the back of Luce's shop. Their foreplay gets interrupted by Heck, who has stopped by to pick up flowers for Rachel. He tells Luce that he has sensed the distance growing between him and Rachel and partially blames himself for not being there for her. Hearing this, Rachel runs off, later sorrowfully agreeing with Luce that they can't betray Heck. In the meantime, Heck reaches his breaking point at his job and finally quits. When he returns home drunk, Rachel rashly confesses all to him as he sleeps, but without saying who her love is. Heck, who was actually feigning sleep, later calls Coop for support. Coop angrily confronts Luce after figuring out it was her with whom Rachel fell in love. Luce decides that being near Rachel without being with her is too hard. She makes plans to go on an extended trip out of the country, leaving care of her shop to her mother.\n\nWhile Rachel and Heck are celebrating her birthday at her parents', H tells them about Luce's trip. Heck notices Rachel's reaction to the news and figures out that it was Luce with whom Rachel fell in love. Heck does not want to be her second choice or to live a lie, but does want her to be happy, so he leaves. Rachel then confesses to her parents that she is in love with a woman and, with their help, she tracks down Luce, who has already taken a taxi to the airport. Rachel gets stuck in traffic and tries to call Luce, who ignores her. However, Rachel realizes Luce is in the same traffic jam when she hears the same man on a bicycle singing \"Happy Together\" and comments, \"I've heard that song before\", and proceeds to climb on the roof of her car. She then uses the lessons Luce taught her at the football match about how to yell loudly to call to her. The two women reunite and kiss each other in the middle of a crowded London street.\n\nAs the ending credits roll, we see the characters some time later. Heck is on a plane to an unknown destination, all set to write his travel book, when he discovers a young woman (Angel Coulby) will be sitting next to him for the long flight. There is an obvious and immediate attraction, and nervous flirtation, between them. The scenes continue with H and her young boyfriend playing at a playground, Coop holding a baby, and Luce and Rachel enjoying each other's company.\n\n\n\n\"Imagine Me & You\" was given a score of 33% on the movie review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 96 reviews. The consensus reads, \"Aside from its lesbian theme, \"Imagine Me & You\" can only offer more of the same generic rom-com cliches.\"\n\nLuce and Rachel were both included in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters.\n\nAutostraddle ranked the film at 18 on its list of the 103 best lesbian films of all time.\n\n"}

Created by writer Clive Barker, Kirsty first appears in the 1986 novella \"The Hellbound Heart\", whose full name is identified in the sequels as Kirsty Singer, before being adapted in the 1987 film adaptation \"Hellraiser\" as Kirsty Cotton. The character served as a major focus in the original film and its sequel \"\", later playing a supporting role in \"\". In all of her appearances in the film series, she was portrayed by actress Ashley Laurence. The film describes her as being Larry Cotton's daughter while, in the novel, she is simply a friend of his.\n\nKirsty first appears in \"Hellraiser\" as the teenage daughter of Larry Cotton (Andrew Robinson) and stepdaughter of his second wife Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins), Kirsty moves with her parents to England to the house of her uncle Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman), who has disappeared sometime ago, but refuses to live with her parents, instead opting to live in a place of her own. When passing by her parents house one day, Kirsty sees Julia and a man enter the place and, believing Julia to be cheating on her father, follows the two inside and up to the attic of the house. It is there that Kirsty witnesses Julia attack the man and her uncle Frank, who is now a skinless entity needing to feast on the blood of others for nourishment, begin to eat him. When the man tries to escape, Frank chases after him and discovers Kirsty, whom he tries to attack, before stopping when she grabs the nearby Lemarchand's box. Realizing the puzzle box has some significance to Frank, Kirsty tosses it out a window, distracting him and allowing her to escape outside where she, after picking up the box, collapses. Found and taken to a hospital, Kirsty wakes up and, at first believing everything that has happened to be a dream, realizes she is wrong when a doctor hands her the box. Toying with the puzzle box, Kirsty solves and inadvertently summons the sadomasochistic demons known as the Cenobites and their leader, Pinhead (Doug Bradley). Kirsty bargains with the Cenobites, revealing to them that she knows where the escaped Frank is and offering them him instead of herself. After escaping from the hospital (presumably with the assistance of the Cenobites), she returns to her father's house and encounters Julia and her father, who claim Frank is dead and shows her his body. This turns out to be a ruse, as it is actually Larry who is dead, Frank having killed him and taken his skin to wear as a disguise. Trying to kill Kirsty when the Cenobites reappear, Frank accidentally stabs Julia to death and is in turn dismembered by the Cenobites with hooks. With Frank and Julia dealt with, the Cenobites turn their attention to Kirsty, who, while fleeing from them, stumbles upon Lemarchand's box which Julia's corpse is clutching and, using it, manages to banish the Cenobites back to their dimension. With the Cenobites gone, Kirsty attempts to destroy the puzzle box once and for all by burning it, but while in the midst of doing so, a man grabs it from the fire and transforms into a winged, skeletal creature before flying away.\n\nIn \"\", Kirsty is in the Channard Institute, a psychiatric hospital, after being traumatized by the events of \"Hellraiser\". She tells the head doctor of the hospital, Dr. Philip Channard (Kenneth Cranham), and his assistant Kyle MacRae (William Hope), about her experiences with the Cenobites. Kirsty begs them to destroy the mattress that her stepmother died on, believing that it connects to the Cenobites realm. Dr. Channard is revealed to have been searching for Lemarchand's box for most of his life. He summons Julia from the mattress by having a mentally ill patient kill himself on it. Kirsty asks for Kyles' help in stopping whatever it is Channard plans to do. Going to Channard's house alongside Kyle, Kirsty plans to use the Lament Configuration to resurrect her father. Kyle is killed and eaten by Julia. Then Kirsty, Channard and another patient of Channard's; the seemingly-mute Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) are taken to the Cenobites' realm. After an encounter between Julia and Frank, with the former killing the latter, Kirsty and Tiffany are attacked by the Cenobites. Before the Cenobites torture them, Kirsty reveals to Pinhead a picture of a man identical in appearance to him she found in Channard's office. Seeing the picture, Pinhead and the other Cenobites realize that they were once human, minutes before being killed by Channard, now a Cenobite himself. As Channard returns to his psychiatric institute and goes on a rampage, Kirsty has Tiffany re-solve the Lemarchand's box while she uses Julia's skin to disguise herself as her. Lured back to the Cenobites' realm, Channard tries to kill Tiffany, only to be fooled by the disguised Kirsty and be accidentally killed by Leviathan. With Channard dead, Kirsty and Tiffany manage to escape back to Earth using the puzzle box.\n\nKirsty makes a small cameo appearance in \"\" in several videos taken from the Channard Institute that protagonist Joey Summerskill (Terry Farrell) watches to learn about the Cenobites.\n\nKirsty returns in the sixth installment of the \"Hellraiser\" series, \"\", where she has married a man named Trevor Gooden (Dean Winters), and supposedly died in a car crash, which Trevor has incurred amnesia from. Attempting to piece his life back together, Trevor's past is revealed to him by Pinhead, who reveals to Trevor that he repeatedly cheated on Kirsty and had conspired with a friend to kill her using Lemarchand's box. Trevor's plan backfired, as, after summoning Pinhead and the Cenobites, Kirsty proposed to give them five souls for her own. Pinhead reveals to Trevor that Kirsty had killed three of his mistresses and his friend, and that he is the fifth sacrifice. Trevor is in the Cenobites' realm, Kirsty shot him in the head while the two were driving, which caused the car accident. The film's final shot has Kirsty leaving a crime scene with Lermanchand's box; having escaped all conviction by framing Trevor for the murders she committed before killing him.\n\nKirsty originates from the novel \"The Hellbound Heart\". This version is not Rory Cotton's daughter, but rather a friend who shares a romantic interest in. The 2018 sequel to \"The Hellbound Heart\", \"Hellraiser: The Toll\", identifies the character as Kirsty Singer. Kirsty reappears in Boom! Studios' \"Hellraiser\" comic series, set roughly twenty years after the events of the first film. By issue 8, she becomes a Cenobite, a female Pinhead, as the original Pinhead becomes human again.\n\nIn \"Divine Horror: Essays on the Cinematic Battle Between the Sacred and the Diabolical\", Cynthia J. Miller and A. Bowdoin Van Riper note the differences between Kirsty and Julia, stating:\n\n"}
{"id": "1181423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1181423", "title": "Multi-instrumentalist", "text": "Multi-instrumentalist\n\nA multi-instrumentalist is a musician who plays two or more musical instruments at a professional level of proficiency. \n\nAlso known as doubling, the practice allows greater ensemble flexibility and more efficient employment of musicians, where a particular instrument may be employed only briefly or sporadically during a performance. Doubling is not uncommon in orchestra (e.g., flutists who double on piccolo) and jazz (saxophone/flute players); double bass players might also perform on electric bass. In music theatre, a pit orchestra's reed players might be required to perform on multiple instruments. Church piano players are often expected to play the church's pipe organ or Hammond organ as well. \n\nIn popular music it is more common than in classical or jazz for performers to be proficient on instruments not from the same family, for instance to play both guitar and keyboards. Many bluegrass musicians are multi-instrumentalists. Some musicians' unions or associations specify a higher rate of pay for musicians who double on two or more instruments for a performance or recording.\n\nThe European \"Piffari\", \"Stadtpfeifer\" and \"Waits\" were multi-instrumentalists, who played trumpet, sackbut, shawm, cornett, recorder and string-instruments. Musicians with an education of a \"Stadtpfeifer\" were Gottfried Reiche, Johann Joachim Quantz, Johann Christof Pezel and Sigmund Theophil Staden. Also many European church musicians of the 17th and 18th centuries were multi-instrumentalists, who played several instruments. Georg Philipp Telemann for example played violin, viola da gamba, recorder, flauto traverso, oboe, shawm, sackbut and double bass.\n\nSome famous classical composer-performers could play multiple instruments at a high level, such as Mozart, who was a virtuoso on the keyboard and violin. Music written for symphony orchestra usually calls for a percussion section featuring a number of musicians who might each play a variety of different instruments during a performance. Orchestras will also often, but not always, call for several members of the woodwind section to be multi-instrumentalists. This is sometimes referred to as doubling. Typically, for example, one flute player in the orchestra will switch to playing the piccolo or alto flute when called to by the score. Similarly, clarinet players may double on bass clarinet, oboe players on cor anglais, and bassoon players on contrabassoon. Trumpet players may switch to piccolo trumpet for certain Baroque literature, and first trombone players may switch to alto trombone. Organ players are also commonly expected to master the harpsichord as well. Doubling elsewhere in the orchestra is rare. With musical theatre pit orchestras, woodwind players are expected to play a large number of woodwind instruments.\n\nIn the swing era of big band music, woodwind players were often expected to play multiple woodwind instruments; saxophonists might be offered gigs where they were also required to play clarinet, for example. \n\nThe different types of saxophone use similar designs, varying mainly only in size (and therefore pitch), meaning that once a player has learned to play one it is relatively easy for them to translate the skills into another. As a result, many jazz saxophone players have made careers playing several different instruments, such as John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter, both of whom have frequently used both tenor and soprano saxophones. To a lesser extent this is also the case across the range of woodwind instruments: Jazz flute players often play other instruments as well, such as Eric Dolphy and Herbie Mann, both of whom frequently played flute and saxophone; Dolphy also recorded on bass clarinet. In the early years of jazz, when the genre was still linked to the marching band genre, many double-bass players doubled on tuba. \n\nFrom the 1950s onwards and particularly since the development of jazz-rock fusion in the late 1960s, many double-bass players doubled on electric bass, e.g. Stanley Clarke and John Patitucci. \n\nSome jazz instrumentalists whose main instrument is a horn or bass also play jazz piano, because piano is an excellent instrument for composing and arranging, and for developing greater harmonic knowledge. \n\nMany famous jazz musicians, including James Morrison, Don Burrows, and Brian Landrus, are multi-instrumentalists.\n\nIn popular music styles, many musicians and songwriters are multi-instrumentalists. Songwriters often play both piano, a key instrument for arranging and composing, and popular pop or rock instruments such as guitar. A backing band member who doubles will be instructed by the bandleader when to switch instruments (e.g., from bass to Hammond organ). When playing live, most multi-instrumentalists will concentrate on their main instrument and/or vocals, and hire or recruit backing musicians (or use a sequencer) to play the other instruments, thus benefiting from economies of scope.\n\nSome musicians have pushed the limits of human musical skill on different instruments. British entertainer Roy Castle once set a world record by playing the same tune on 43 different instruments in four minutes. Anton Newcombe, frontman for The Brian Jonestown Massacre, has claimed to be able to play 80 different instruments.\n\nIn bluegrass music, it is very common for musicians to be skilled on a number of different instruments, including guitar, banjo, fiddle and upright bass.\n\n\n"}

He is a professor of photography at the University for the Creative Arts in Rochester, Kent, England.\n\nOri Gersht was born in Tel Aviv. He graduated in Photography, Film and Video from University of Westminster, London and studied for an M.A. in Photography from the Royal College of Art, London.\nGersht has exhibited widely in museums and galleries since the early 1990s. He is represented by Angles Gallery in Los Angeles, CRG Gallery in New York, Ben Brown Fine Arts in London, and Noga Gallery in Tel Aviv. In 2012, Gersht's show \"History Repeating\" was mounted at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n\nGersht engages the themes of life, death, violence, and beauty. His photographs and films transcribe images of sites of historical significance—the Judean Desert, Sarajevo, Auschwitz, the Galicia region of Ukraine, the Lister Route in the Pyrenees (on which Walter Benjamin made his ill-fated exodus from Nazi-occupied France)—into ciphers of psychological disruption. Such scenes may not seem out of the ordinary unto themselves, but, through the artist’s focused attention and treatment they evoke the emotional resonance of what has transpired—most often, violence, and, more significantly, the ghosts of war’s most egregious detritus, its refugees.\nPervasive in Gersht’s work is the landscape, as a place, an idea, and an art historical trope. His films and photographs may be compared to paintings in their display—from their unhindered access (no Plexiglas separates their surfaces from the viewer) to the frames surrounding the monitors on which the films often play. Moreover, the vistas and horizons of, for instance, \"Between Places\" (1998–2000), \"White Noise\" (1999–2000), \"The Clearing/Liquidation\" (2005), and \"Evaders\" (2009), recall Romantic depictions of the sublime. They conjure precedents in both photography, such as the breathtaking vistas of Andreas Gursky and the landscapes of the American South by Sally Mann, and painting, by J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, and even Mark Rothko.\n\nIn his still life series Gersht investigated the relationships between photography, technology and optical perception, at a pivotal moment in the history of photography where digital technology both threatens a crisis and promises a breakthrough. Research into the early history of the medium of photography is brought together with theoretical discourse, creating, still image and films that (literally) explode the genre of still life, the beautiful and destructive results captured using cutting-edge technology. In \"Pomegranate\", a film that references Juan Sanchez Cotan’s 17th-century still life and Harold Edgerton’s stroboscopic photography, a high velocity bullet flies across the frame in slow motion and obliterates a suspended pomegranate fruit, bursting it open and wheeling it slowly into the air like a smashed violated mouth spraying seeds. A peaceful image is transformed into bloodshed, and a dialogue is established between stillness and motion, peace and violence.\n\nGersht’s photographs and films provide a meditation on life, loss, destiny and chance. Allusions to the catastrophic violence of the French Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, the bombing of Hiroshima, and the suicide bombs that Gersht anticipated during his childhood in Israel can all be found in this work. As such, it reminds us of our past, present, and future, and, above all, the fragility of life itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Foundation's main purpose is to promote the study and teaching of Chinese art and culture. The collection consists of some 1,700 pieces of Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasty porcelain from the 10th century to the 18th, as well as a painting, \"Scroll of Antiquities (Guwan tu)\" dating from the Yongzheng (1723–35) reign.\n\nThe collection concentrates on pieces in the \"Chinese taste\" rather than export wares, and on Imperial porcelain, much of it Jingdezhen ware. It includes superb examples of the rare Ru and Guan wares and two important Yuan dynasty blue and white porcelain temple vases (the \"David Vases\"), the oldest dated blue and white porcelain pieces, from 1351. The Foundation also has a large library of Western and East Asian books related to Chinese art; this and archival material are housed in the library of SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies), University of London.\n\nIn 1950, the Collection was presented to the University of London by the collector and scholar Sir Percival David, who had assembled it.\n\nThe collection dates back to 1927 when many of the items in the Forbidden City were being sold off by eunuchs and other members of the Imperial Household Department. Empress Dowager Cixi is said to have used many items as collateral for loans from various Chinese banks in 1901. David convinced the officials to mount a display of many of the best items. When they started to come on the market, David managed to buy some forty pieces one way or the other and export them to the United States. In 1930, he again returned to China and helped with various exhibitions and produced a series of catalogues of the pieces. He also acquired more items through various dealers in Beijing. This means that many pieces were once owned by the Qing dynasty emperors and several pieces have inscriptions added by the orders of the Qianlong Emperor (1736–95).\n\nIn 1931, David's collection was displayed in the Dorchester Hotel in London. It remained there until it was evacuated to the countryside during World War II. David also created a Chair in Chinese Art and Architecture with the Courtauld Institute of Art, which is part of the University of London. Towards the end of his life he was determined to keep the collection together, and to this end entered negotiations with the University of London. An agreement was reached to keep the collection and the library together in a foundation attached to SOAS.\n\nThe chair that David had created was also moved to SOAS. Previous holders of the chair, called the Percival David Professor of Chinese and East Asian Art, include William Watson, Roderick Whitfield and Craig Clunas. The current incumbent is Shane McCausland. Just before the opening of the collection, the foundation was also given a small collection of porcelain belonging to Mountstuart Elphinstone. The collection was opened to the public on 10 June 1952 in a house in Gordon Square, Bloomsbury.\n\nThe Foundation has been a generous lender to other countries. It lent many items of Yuan dynasty porcelain to Venice's 700th-anniversary celebration of Marco Polo's expedition. It has also sent other items to places as far away as Japan and the United States.\n\nThe Library collection was a working library and as such was open to researchers from around the world.\n\nDue to a funding crisis, the Gordon Square building housing the Foundation's collection closed at the end of 2007. The ceramics collection has been loaned on a long-term basis to the British Museum, where the whole collection, about 1,700 objects, is on permanent public display in a specially designed new gallery (Room 95, British Museum) opened in April 2009, thanks to the generosity of Sir Joseph Hotung. The public gallery is part of the Sir Joseph Hotung Centre for Ceramic Studies, which will include facilities to use the collection for teaching.\n\n\"Chinese Ceramics: Highlights of the Sir Percival David Collection\", by Regina Krahl and Jessica Harrison-Hall, was published in April 2009 by the British Museum Press to coincide with the opening of the new display.\n\n"}

Native photography stands in contrast to the ubiquitous photography of indigenous peoples by non-natives, which has often been criticized as being staged, exoticized, and romanticized.\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas embraced photography in the 19th century. Some even owned and operated their own photography studios, such as Antonio Calderón Sandoval (Purépecha, ca. 1847–unknown), the grandfather of Frida Kahlo; Benjamin Haldane (1874–1941), Tsimshian of Metlakatla Village on Annette Island, Alaska; and Richard Throssel (1882–1933), Cree of Montana. Max T. Vargas (father of pin-up artist Alberto Vargas), was a successful Mestizo photographer in Arequipa, Peru, who taught photography to Martín Chambi (Quechua, 1891–1973), an Indigenous miner. Jennie Ross Cobb (1881–1959), Cherokee Nation of Park Hill, Oklahoma, began developing her own film as a young child and photographed her college classmates, family, neighbors, and students.\n\nThe works of these early indigenous photographer stand in stark contrast to the romanticized images of non-native photographers. Recent scholarship by Mique’l Askren (Tsimshian-Tlingit) on the photographs of Benjamin A. Haldane has analyzed the functions that Haldane's photographs served for his community: as markers of success by having European-American-style formal portraits taken, and as markers of the continuity of potlaching and customary ceremonials by having photographs taken in ceremonial regalia. This second category is particularly significant because the use of the ceremonial regalia was against the law in Canada between 1885-1951.\n\nNative American boarding schools were important centers for photography at the turn of the century. John Leslie (Puyallup) learned photography at Carlisle Indian School. In 1895, Leslie published a book of his photography and exhibited his photographs at the 1895 Atlanta International Exposition By 1906 Carlisle Indian School built a state-of-the-art photography studio and taught photography classes to its Native students. Parker McKenzie (1897–1999) and his wife Nettie Odlety McKenzie (1896–1978) purchased cameras and took photographs while they attended Phoenix Indian School in 1916.\n\nPeter Pitseolak (1902–1973), Inuk from Cape Dorset, Nunavut, documented Inuit life in the mid-20th century while dealing with challenges presented by the harsh climate and extreme light conditions of the Canadian Arctic. He developed his film himself in his igloo, and some of his photos were shot by oil lamps.\n\nHorace Poolaw (1906–1984), Kiowa, shot over 2,000 images of his neighbors and relatives in Western Oklahoma from the 1920s onward.\n\nJean Fredericks (b. 1906), Hopi, had to carefully negotiate cultural views towards photography and made a point of not offering his portraits of Hopi people for sale to the public.\n\nFor a 1980s exhibit of Hopi photographers at Northlight Gallery in Tempe, Arizona, Victor Masayesva, Jr. (Hopi) explained how Hopis protect their privacy from the flood of photographs of them and their community by non-Hopi people. Hopi photographers know that certain subjects, especially ceremonial dances are not meant to be photographed. \"The camera which is available to us is a weapon that will violate the silences and secrets so essential to our group survival,\" he wrote. Many Hopi photographers do not sell their work to outsides.\n\nThe establishment of tribal newspapers, such as the \"Qua Toqti\" and \"Hopi Tribal News\" both in the 1970s, created a demand for Native photojournalists. Owen Seumptewa (Hopi) became photographic consultant to his tribe in 1976.\n\nWhile many native photographers were interested in documenting tribal life, Luis González Palma (Mestizo, b. 1957) borrows from a Victorian aesthetic to create haunting, mysterious portraits of Mayan and mestizo people, especially women, from his native Guatemala. He shoots in black and white but then hand-tints the photographs in sepia tones.\n\nThe first Canadian national conference of indigenous photographers took place in March 1985 in Hamilton, Ontario, and from that the Native Indian/Inuit Photographers' Association (NIIPA) was formed. During the 1980s, NIIPA had fifty members from North America.\n\nToday more Native people are professional art photographers; however, acceptance to the genre has met with challenges. Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie (Navajo-Muscogee-Seminole), has not only established a successful career with her own work, she has also been an advocate for the entire field of Native American photography. She has curated shows and organized conferences at the C.N. Gorman Museum at UC Davis featuring Native American photographers. Tsinhnahjinnie wrote the book, \"Our People, Our Land, Our Images: International Indigenous Photographers.\" Larry McNeil (Tlingit) is a fine art photographer and professor who has mentored many emerging indigenous photographers. Together with Tsinhnahjinnie, McNeil curated \"New Native Photography\" at the New Mexico Museum of Art to draw more attention to the genre of photography during the 2011 Santa Fe Indian Market.\n\nNative photographers taking their skills into the fields of art videography, photocollage, digital photography, and digital art.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4692580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4692580", "title": "Romance Writers of America", "text": "Romance Writers of America\n\nRomance Writers of America (RWA) is a national non-profit genre writers association. It provides networking and support to individuals seriously pursuing a career in romance fiction and supports top authors such as Nora Roberts and Judith McNaught.\n\nFounded in 1980 in Houston, Texas by romance editor Vivian Stephens and 37 authors in the romance genre, including Rita Clay Estrada and Parris Afton Bonds, first President and Vice President, the RWA has long been an advocacy group for their published members. It has persuaded Harlequin books to register copyrights for authors' works and to allow writers to own their own pseudonyms. Previously, authors were forced to leave their pseudonym behind if they switched publishing houses, making it more difficult for their fans to follow. The current mission statement indicates that the purpose of the RWA is to \"advance the professional interests of career-focused romance writers through networking and advocacy.\" \n\nIn 2000, the RWA had an operating budget of over $1 million, the largest of any professional genre writers' organization. As of 2007, the organization had over 9,000 members and over 150 chapters. These include chapters arranged geographically as well as special-interest online chapters that focus on themes such as medical romance. Approximately 2,000 of the members have had books published.\n\nRWA offers two programs. The Published Author Network (PAN) consists of published authors. The PRO network is for authors who have completed a manuscript and can prove they've queried an editor or agent about submitting it. Approximately 2000 RWA members have joined the PRO program. Once a PRO member, they are able to view online workshops and booklets about the business of publishing.\n\nRWA chapters allow members to come together for support and to learn more about the industry. They provide writers with the opportunity to meet, either in person or online, in order to critique and learn the art of writing. With this practice, \"romance writers are the only authors who train their own competition and pride themselves on sharing what they know.\"\n\nGeneral Membership in RWA is open to those actively pursuing a career in romance fiction regardless of publishing status. A writer does not need to be published to join but must be working toward that goal. \n\nAssociate membership is available to publishers, editors, agents and other industry professionals who work in the romance publishing field. Associate members do not have the right to vote and are ineligible to hold office. \n\nAffiliate membership is available to librarians and booksellers.\n\nThe RWA was formed to assist authors of romance novels. According to the RWA, the main plot of a romance novel must revolve around the two people as they develop romantic love for each other and work to build a relationship together. Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain subplots that do not specifically relate to the main characters' romantic love. Furthermore, a romance novel must have an \"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\" \n\nSome romance novel authors and readers believe the genre has additional restrictions, from plot considerations such as the protagonists meeting early on in the story, to avoiding themes such as adultery. Disagreements have centered on the firm requirement for a happy ending, or the place of same-sex relationships within the genre. Some readers admit stories without a happy ending, if the focus of the story is on the romantic love between the two main characters (e.g. Romeo and Juliet). Others believe the definition should be more strictly worded to include only heterosexual pairing. While the majority of romance novels meet the stricter criteria, there are also many books that are widely considered to be romance novels that deviate from these rules. Therefore, the general definition, as embraced by the RWA and publishers, includes only the focus on a developing romantic relationship and an optimistic ending.\n\nAs long as a romance novel meets that twin criteria, it can be set in any time period and in any location. There are no specific restrictions on what can or cannot be included in a romance novel. Even very controversial subjects are addressed in romance novels, including topics such as date rape, domestic violence, addiction, and disability. The combination of time frame, location, and plot elements does, however, help a novel to fit into one of several romance subgenres. Despite the numerous possibilities this framework allows, many people in the mainstream press claim that \"all [romance novels] seem to read alike.\"\n\nOf the 9000 RWA members, approximately 2,000 have seen their novels published in print. An unknown number of other writers have published their books through electronic publishers. Eight percent of all electronic books are romances, the RWA does not recognize vanity publishers who offer little or no editing or promotional help. Any RWA General or Honorary member in good standing who has earned at least: (1) $1,000 in the form of an advance on a single Eligible Novel* or Eligible Novella** (“Option One”); or (2) $1,000 in the form of royalties or a combination of advance plus royalties on a single published Eligible Novel* or Eligible Novella** (“Option Two”); or (3) $5,000 in the form of earnings for a Self-Published novel or novella (“Option Three”) that meets the definition of Romance Fiction shall be eligible for membership in PAN, the Published Author Network within RWA. In Spring 2010, because they've signed a contract to publish their manuscript, these published authors are not eligible to enter the unpublished Golden Heart contest.\n\nEvery summer, the RWA holds a national conference. In 2007, approximately 1900 members attended the conference in Dallas, Texas, participating in workshops and attending lectures designed for both published and unpublished authors. A Librarian's Day started the conference, and, in 2007, over 150 librarians attended presentations by some of the more popular romance authors, including Jayne Ann Krentz, Suzanne Brockmann, Nora Roberts, Shana Abe, and Susan Elizabeth Phillips. Each year, some of the workshops are business-oriented, focusing on how to pitch a novel or write for multiple publishers. Other workshops focus on creative pursuits, including how to use swords and sword fights in a story line, how to use firefighter lingo, or how to pick the cover art for your book. The annual conference features a literacy signing, where the public is invited to meet close to 500 authors and gain autographs. In 2007, the event raised almost $60,000 for literacy charities. The conference ends with the RITA and Golden Heart awards ceremony.\n\nThe RWA funds several scholarships for members to attend the national conference. The scholarships pay for travel, lodging, and registration fees.\n\nFirst awarded in 1982 in four categories, the Golden Medallion award was the most prominent award given throughout the genre of romantic fiction. The categories expanded to six in 1983, eight by 1989 and eventually twelve. In 1990 the Golden Medallion was replaced with the RITA Award.\n\nThe most prominent award given throughout the genre of romantic fiction is the RWA RITA Award. Named for the RWA's first president, Rita Clay Estrada, the award signifies excellence in one of 12 categories of romantic fiction. Authors and editors submit published works for consideration in the fall. In mid-spring, finalists are announced. The winners are presented with a statuette in a ceremony held on the last day of the RWA National Conference each July.\n\nThe RWA also honors unpublished authors. Over 1000 manuscripts are submitted to the competition each year. The first round is judged by a panel of RWA members. One hundred manuscripts are chosen as finalists. The finalists' manuscripts are judged by acquiring editors from romance publishing houses. The winners of the competition are announced on the last day of the RWA Annual National Conference. Generally, about 30% of Golden Heart finalists find their work accepted by print publishers.\n\nThe award itself is a gold medallion in a heart shape thus giving the award its name.\n\nThe RWA Hall of Fame was established as a way of honoring those authors that have won at least three RITA Awards in a specific category of romance (For example: Long Contemporary Romance, Romantic Suspense, or Regency Romance). Formerly a novelist had to have won four RITA Awards in a specific category to be inducted into the Hall of Fame but the criteria for induction changed to require only three RITA Awards per category. The first RWA Hall of Fame inductee was Nora Roberts. Other authors honored include Jo Beverley and Jennifer Greene.\n\n"}

It is in the church of Ognissanti in Florence.\n\nBotticelli was born in a house in the same street as the church, still called Via Borgo Ognissanti. He was to live within a minute or two's walk of this all his life, and to be buried in the church.\n\nIn 1464 Botticelli's father bought a house in Via Nuova nearby (modern Via della Porcellana), which Sandro took over in 1470 and lived in for the rest of his life. Here the notable family on the street were the Vespucci, including Amerigo Vespucci, born in 1454, after whom the Americas were named. The Vespucci were close Medici allies, and would become regular patrons of Botticelli.\n\nThe work was commissioned by the Vespucci family, probably Amerigo's father Nastaglio, a notary, and his brother Giorgio Antonio, both neighbours of Botticelli. Someone else, probably the order running the church, commissioned Domenico Ghirlandaio to do a facing \"Saint Jerome\"; both saints were shown writing in their studies, which are crowded with objects. As in other cases, such direct competition \"was always an inducement to Botticelli to put out all his powers\", and the fresco, now his earliest to survive, is regarded as his finest by Ronald Lightbown. Both depicted two Doctors of the Church in their studies, with a number of objects which mark them as scholars and precursors of Renaissance Humanism. There is known to have been a small painting of Jerome in his study said to have been by Jan van Eyck in the Medici collection, which is now lost. This may have influenced both frescos.\n\nThey decorated the screen of the unusually located choir, which was demolished in 1564–1566, when they were detached and moved to the nave. They are now in the refectory, moved there after sustaining slight damage in the 1966 flood of the Arno. In the first move part of the frame with its inscriptions went lost, and all of Jerome's.\n\nIt portrays Augustine of Hippo in meditation inside his study. The precise subject is a legend, probably first found in the 13th century, of a vision Augustine had as he began to write a letter to Jerome in his study at Hippo in 420. The time is shown on the clock by his head as the end of the twenty-fourth hour, counting from the previous sunset. This is the hour of Compline, specified in the legend. A light and sweet odour came into his study and a voice told him that \"he might as soon enclose the ocean in a small vessel, as soon clasp the whole earth in his fist, as soon halt the movement of the heavens as describe the beatitude of the saints without having experienced it\", as the speaker was now doing. When Augustine asked who he was, he replied he was Jerome. Augustine later heard that Jerome had died in Jerusalem at exactly that hour.\n\nThe coat of arms visible in the upper part is that of the Vespucci family; Jerome has no equivalent arms.\n\nThe lines in the book over the saint's head are mostly meaningless, apart from a line in which reads: \"Dov'è Frate Martino? È scappato. E dov'è andato? È fuor dalla Porta al Prato\" (\"Where is Brother Martino? He went out. And where did he go? He is outside Porta al Prato\"), probably referring to the escapades of one of the Uumiliati, the order who ran the church. Lightbown suggests that this shows Botticelli thought \"the example of Jerome and Augustine likely to be thrown away on the Umiliati as he knew them\".\n\n\n"}

The theatre is located in a central block of the city of La Plata, the capital of Buenos Aires Province. The venue occupies the block bounded by the 9 and 10 streets and 51 & 53 avenues; it belongs to the \"Monumental Axis\" of public buildings in La Plata. \n\nThe original building was a classic Italian opera house, conceived in renaissance style by the Italian architect Leopoldo Rocchi. Construction began in 1887, five years after the foundation of the city of La Plata itself. The main hall had a capacity of \"ca.\" 1,500 seats. It was inaugurated on November 19, 1890, with Giuseppe Verdi's \"Otello\"; in leading roles were the Italian soprano Elvira Colonnese (Desdemona) and the Uruguayan tenor José Oxilia (Othello).\nThe theatre grew to accommodate a renowned stable orchestra and chorus. A stable ballet company was added in 1946. Among the great artists that performed at the Teatro Argentino we find singers such as Maria Barrientos, Luisa Tetrazzini, Marian Anderson, Emma Carelli, Fedora Barbieri, Tito Schipa, Beniamino Gigli, Titta Ruffo, and Mario del Monaco, classical ballet dancers such as Anna Pavlova, Dore Hoyer and Iris Scaccheri, as well as musicians such as Pietro Mascagni, Richard Strauss (with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra), Arthur Rubinstein, Andrés Segovia, Alexander Brailowsky, Claudio Arrau, Pablo Casals, and Yehudi Menuhin.\n\nUnfortunately, a major fire destroyed the original building in 1977, leaving only the badly damaged exterior walls standing. Against national and international outcry, the \"de facto\" government of the military dictatorship at the time (the so-called \"Proceso de Reorganizacion Nacional\") decided against rebuilding the original classic structure. Instead, it chose to replace it with a massive Theatre & Cultural Centre designed in a brutalist style, located on the same city block. During the intervening years (1977–1999), the Teatro Argentino companies continued to produce performances in various La Plata venues, notably the former movie theatre, the Cine Gran Rocha. After much planning and rescheduling due to economic difficulties, the new building was finished and inaugurated on October 12, 1999 with a performance that included excerpts from works of Giuseppe Verdi, Charles Gounod, Umberto Giordano and Gaetano Donizetti, as well as the ballet \"Tango en gris\" (\"Tango in grey\"), with music by Atilio Stampone and \"régie\" by Oscar Araiz. \n\nThe new complex includes today a 2,000-seat operatic venue with a typical European horseshoe structure, named Alberto Ginastera Hall after the famous Argentine composer. An enormous three-tonne bronze chandelier with 400 light-bulbs hangs over the main floor, in an exact replica of the one featured in the original building.\n\nThe complex also includes the smaller 300-seat Ástor Piazzolla Hall, as well as rehearsal areas, and space for the associated technical shops. The lower level includes the Emilio Pettoruti Exhibition Hall for permanent and transient art collections.\n\nDespite the excellent technical facilities and the superb acoustics of the main hall, the complex itself, built in brutalist style, continues to be regarded as a sort of eyesore by the local population.\n\n\n"}

Its screenplay, by Nicholas Meyer, is based on the novel of the same name by Philip Roth. The film stars Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman.\n\nIn the late 1990s, writer Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise) has settled in a lakeside New England cabin following his second divorce and a battle with prostate cancer. His quiet life is interrupted by Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins), a former dean and professor of classics at local Athena College, who was forced to resign after being accused of making a racist remark in class. Coleman's wife died suddenly following the scandal, and he wants to avenge his loss of career and companion by writing a book about the events with Nathan's assistance.\n\nThe project is placed on the back burner when Coleman has an affair with Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman), a considerably younger, semi-literate woman who supports herself by working menial jobs, including at the college. Their relationship is threatened by the faculty members who forced Coleman from his job and by Faunia's stalker ex-husband Lester (Ed Harris), a mentally unbalanced Vietnam War veteran who blames her for the deaths of their children in an accident. Flashbacks of Coleman's life reveal to the audience his secret: he is an African American who has \"passed\" as a white Jewish man for most of his adult life.\n\n\nThe film debuted at the Venice Film Festival. It was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival, the Bergen International Film Festival, and the Hollywood Film Festival before its theatrical release in the US.\n\nThe film grossed $5,381,908 in the US and $19,481,896 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $24,863,304 against a budget of $30 million.\n\n\"The Human Stain\" received mixed reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 41% of 148 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 5.5 out of 10. The site's consensus is that \"Though the acting is fine, the leads are miscast, and the story is less powerful on screen than on the page.\"\n\nIn his review in \"The New York Times\", A.O. Scott called it \"an honorable B+ term paper of a movie: sober, scrupulous and earnestly respectful of its literary source . . . The filmmakers explicate Mr. Roth's themes with admirable clarity and care and observe his characters with delicate fondness, but they cannot hope to approximate the brilliance and rapacity of his voice, which holds all the novel's disparate elements together. Without the active intervention of Mr. Roth's intelligence . . . the story fails to cohere . . . At its best - which also tends to be at its quietest - \"The Human Stain\" allows you both to care about its characters and to think about the larger issues that their lives represent. Its deepest flaw is an inability to link those moments of empathy and insight into a continuous drama, to suggest that the characters' lives keep going when they are not on screen.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" observed, \"We have to suspend disbelief over the casting, but that's easier since we can believe the stories of these people. Not many movies probe into matters of identity or adaptation. Most movie characters are like Greek gods and comic book heroes: We learn their roles and powers at the beginning of the story, and they never change. Here are complex, troubled, flawed people, brave enough to breathe deeply and take one more risk with their lives.\"\n\nIn the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Mick LaSalle called it \"a mediocre movie . . . [that] falls victim to a fatal lack of narrative drive, suspense and drama. Kidman and Hopkins are wrong for their roles, and that, combined with a pervading inevitability, cuts the film off from any sustained vitality. The result is something admirable but lifeless.\"\n\nDavid Stratton of \"Variety\" described it as \"an intelligent adaptation of Philip Roth's arguably unfilmable novel powered by two eye-catching performances . . . A key problem Benton is unable to avoid is that Hopkins and Miller don't look (or talk) the least bit like one another. Miller, who gives a strong, muted performance, convinces as a light-skinned African-American in a way Hopkins never does, which is not to suggest that the Welsh-born actor doesn't give another intelligent, powerful portrayal.

{"id": "2826896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2826896", "title": "The Old Guitarist", "text": "The Old Guitarist\n\nThe Old Guitarist is an oil painting by Pablo Picasso created late 1903early 1904. It depicts an old, blind, haggard man with threadbare clothing weakly hunched over his guitar, playing in the streets of Barcelona, Spain. It is currently on display at the Art Institute of Chicago as part of the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection.\n\nAt the time of \"The Old Guitarist\"’s creation, Modernism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and Symbolism had merged and created an overall movement called Expressionism which greatly influenced Picasso’s style. Furthermore, El Greco, Picasso’s poor standard of living, and the suicide of a dear friend influenced Picasso’s style at the time which came to be known as his Blue Period. Several x-rays, infrared images and examinations by curators revealed three different figures hidden behind the old guitarist.\n\nAt the time, having renounced his classical and traditional education and searching for fame, Picasso and his friend Carlos Casagemas moved to Paris. A year later, Casagemas became hopelessly miserable from a failed love affair and committed suicide. Picasso was greatly afflicted by this event and was soon depressed and desolate. In addition, Picasso was very poor. His poverty made him identify and relate to beggars, prostitutes and other downtrodden outcasts in society.\n\nThese events and circumstances were the impetus for the beginning of Picasso’s Blue Period which lasted from 1901 to 1904. The Blue Period is identified by the flat expanses of blues, greys and blacks, melancholy figures lost in contemplation, and a deep and significant tragedy. After the Blue Period came Picasso's Rose Period, and eventually the Cubism movement which Picasso co-founded.\n\nElements in \"The Old Guitarist\" were carefully chosen to generate a reaction from the spectator. For example, the monochromatic color scheme creates flat, two-dimensional forms that dissociate the guitarist from time and place. In addition, the overall muted blue palette creates a general tone of melancholy and accentuates the tragic and sorrowful theme. The sole use of oil on panel causes a darker and more theatrical mood. Oil tends to blend the colors together without diminishing brightness, creating an even more cohesive dramatic composition.\n\nFurthermore, the guitarist, although muscular, shows little sign of life and appears to be close to death, implying little comfort in the world and accentuating the misery of his situation. Details are eliminated and scale is manipulated to create elongated and elegant proportions while intensifying the silent contemplation of the guitarist and a sense of spirituality. The large, brown guitar is the only significant shift in color found in the painting; its dull brown, prominent against the blue background, becomes the center and focus. The guitar comes to represent the guitarist’s world and only hope for survival. This blind and poor subject depends on his guitar and the small income he can earn from his music for survival. Some art historians believe this painting expresses the solitary life of an artist and the natural struggles that come with the career. Therefore, music, or art, becomes a burden and an alienating force that isolates artists from the world. And yet, despite the isolation, the guitarist (artist) depends on the rest of society for survival. All of these emotions reflect Picasso’s predicament at the time and his criticism of the state of society. \"The Old Guitarist\" becomes an allegory of human existence.\n\nPaul Mariani, a biographer of Wallace Stevens, presented his analysis of the painting as a counterpoint to objections raised by Stevens concerning the origin of his own poem titled \"The Man With the Blue Guitar\" stating, \"Despite his repeatedly denying it, Stevens does seem to have a particular painting in mind here: Picasso's 1903 \"The Old Guitarist\", which portrays an old man with white hair and beard sitting distorted and cross-legged as he plays his guitar. If Picasso attempted to portray the world of poverty and abject misery, it was because that had been his own plight as a struggling young artist in Barcelona, where he painted many pictures including this one, of the poor. The painting is almost entirely done in monochromatic blues and blue-blacks, except for the guitar itself, which is painted in a slightly warmer brown. The man is blind but, no longer seeing the world around him, he sees more deeply into the reality within.\"\n\nIn the \"Old Guitarist\", Picasso may have drawn upon George Frederic Watts's painting of \"Hope\" (1886), which similarly depicts a hunched, helpless musician with a distorted angular form and predominantly blue tone.\n\nRecent x-rays and examinations by curators found three figures peering behind the old guitarist’s body. The three figures are an old woman with her head bent forward, a young mother with a small child kneeling by her side, and an animal on the right side of the canvas. Despite unclear imagery in crucial areas of the canvas, experts determined that at least two different paintings are found beneath \"The Old Guitarist\".\n\nIn 1998, researchers used an infrared camera to penetrate the uppermost layer of paint (the composition of \"The Old Guitarist\") and clearly saw the second-most composition. By using this camera, researchers were able to discover a young mother seated in the center of the composition, reaching out with her left arm to her kneeling child at her right, and a calf or sheep on the mother’s left side. Clearly defined, the young woman has long, flowing dark hair and a thoughtful expression.\n\nThe Art Institute of Chicago shared its infrared images with the Cleveland Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., where curator William Robinson identified a sketch by Picasso sent to his friend Max Jacob in a letter. It revealed the same composition of mother and child, but it had a cow licking the head of a small calf. In a letter to Jacob, Picasso reveals he was painting this composition a few months before he began \"The Old Guitarist\". Despite these discoveries, the reason Picasso did not complete the composition with a mother and child, and how the older woman fitted into the history of the canvas, remain unknown.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35189349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35189349", "title": "Vedette (cabaret)", "text": "Vedette (cabaret)\n\nA vedette is the main female artist of a show derived from cabaret and its genres (revue, vaudeville, music hall or burlesque). \n\nThe purpose of the vedette in a cabaret or nightclub show is to entertain the public. The vedette has to know how to sing, dance and act on stage. Depending on the quality of its show, career or mastery of one or more stage talents, can be considered a \"super vedette\" or \"first vedette\". Generally a vedette is a woman with physical presence, personality and charisma that captivates the public. In addition to singing, dancing and acting, vedettes often included groups of dancers, flashy and revealing costumes, magicians, comedians, jugglers, and even performing animals. Vedettes specializing in burlesque generally do striptease and may also perform nude on stage.\n\nIn the 20th century, vedette shows were successful in the cabarets, theaters and nightclubs of countries such as Spain, France, Argentina and Mexico. Paris and Las Vegas were considered the main cradle of the vedettes.\n\n\"Vedette\" is a French word originally used to designate an artist of great fame and notoriety.\n\nThe term underwent changes over the years. From the early twentieth century, it began to be used to designate the main female artists of the shows of a cabaret such as burlesque, vaudeville, music hall or revue. The zenith of fame and popularity of these women coincided with various historical moments of 20th century sexual liberation: the 1920s, 1940s and 1970s.\n\nThe vedettes began their rise in popularity in France at the beginning of the 20th century. After France, they have gained greater popularity in Latin countries, both in Europe (Spain) and North and South America (Argentina and Mexico), where they caused a furor in the nightlife at different times. The term is little used in Anglo-Saxon countries, although in the United States there are very popular shows of cabaret and burlesque in the city of Las Vegas, where it is often confused with so-called showgirls. Venues such as Le Lido, the Moulin Rouge, and the Crazy Horse in France. The Teatro Maipo and the Teatro El Nacional in Argentina, and the Teatro de la Ciudad \"Esperanza Iris\" in Mexico are or were famous for their vedette shows.\n\nFrance is considered the cradle of vedettes worldwide. Its capital, Paris, has been home to some of the most famous cabarets in the world. Among these are the Moulin Rouge and the Folies Bergère de Paris, pioneers of night shows in which the vedettes appeared on the scene half naked and doing Tableau vivant. Other famous venues are the Le Lido and Bataclan, also famous for their vaudeville and Revues. In more recent times, this group of entertainment centers would be joined by Crazy Horse.\n\nAmong the main vedettes of France are considered the \"Three Graces\" of Belle Époque: Émilienne d'Alençon, Liane de Pougy, and La Bella Otero. The famous Mistinguett became one of the most popular French artists of her time and the most important woman in the world of the spectacle, while Madame Rasimi is remembered as the founder of the Bataclan. Another outstanding figure was Gina Palerme.\n\nAt the beginning of the century, the novelist Colette was also distinguished by acting in shows of magazine. Another prominent figure at that time is the world-famous Dutch spy Mata Hari.\n\nThe legendary Cléo de Mérode of the Folies Bergère was another of the great stars of the Parisian nightlife of the twentieth century.\nJoséphine Baker, of American origin, is remembered as one of the most important vedettes of the twentieth century. Her \"Revue Nègre\", which included a jazz orchestra, caused a sensation in the Parisian cabarets. Her exotic dance form, her uninhibited sexuality and her minimal dress (which included a skirt made with bananas) were more attractive to Europeans than to Americans. She became the star of Parisian nights and even opened her own club, Chez \"Josephine\".\n\nAnother important figure was Coccinelle, considered the first transsexual vedette in history.\nThe actress and singer Liliane Montevecchi stood out as vedette in the Folies Bergère in the 1970s, and eventually conquered Broadway. Another figure of the time was the Italian Xenia Monty.\n\nIn recent times the vedette shows emphasize figures like Arielle Dombasle (known as the vedette-like Dolorès Sugar Rose) and Marlène Mourreau.\n\nOne of the first vedettes that stood out in Spain are La Bella Otero, a celebrated courtesan who settled in France, one of the most outstanding personages of the Belle Époque in the artistic circles and the gallant life of Paris; Luisa Esteso, famous comedian actress; Encarnación Fernández, who had most of her career in Argentina; Celia Gámez (of Argentine origin), one of the most popular stars of Spain in the first half of the twentieth century, and who owes much of the splendor of the Revues; Paquita Garzón; Rosario Guerrero (called \"The Beautiful Guerrero\"); Rosita Rodrigo; Tina de Jarque, Rosario Soler \"La Patita\", Paquita Escribano, Carmen Tórtola Valencia, specialist in oriental dances and pioneer of women's liberation, and the sisters Laura and Victoria Pinillos.\n\nThe 1940s highlighted figures such as Trini Alonso, María Antinea (also famous in Argentina and Mexico); Maruja Boldoba, Florinda Chico, Gema del Rio, the popular Manolita Chen and her company; Teresita Silva; Maruja Tomás and Helga Liné.\n\nThe 1950s highlighted stars like Mary Begoña, one of the comedic actresses par excellence of the Spanish scene; Licia Calderón, Queta Claver (that became one of the major vedettes of Spain); Raquel Daina; Marujita Díaz, considered as the \"Queen of the Copla\" and \"Queen of the Spanish Music Revue\" and Carmen de Lirio, famous during the dictatorship.\n\nIn the sixties, famous figures such as Mary Santpere, called \"La Reina del Paralelo\" (The Queen of the Parallel) reached the fame of Barcelona's homonymous street, where the greatest number of theaters were concentrated in the 20th century; Rosita Amores, pioneer of the erotic cabaret in the mid-1960s, and who knew how to outwit Franco's censorship in times when eroticism in Spain was confined to the private sphere, becoming a popular symbol of entertainment in the Valencian Community; Marisol Ayuso; Ingrid Garbo, of German origin; Vicky Lagos; Vicky Lusson; Katia Loritz; Esperanza Roy, and Lina Morgan, one of the country's most momentous comic strips. Sara Montiel, deserves special mention, who along with her prestigious film career, excelled in shows as a vedette from this decade.\n\nIn the 1970s María José Cantudo starred in the first full-length female nude (seen through a mirror) of Spanish cinema; Eva León Conde and Barbara Rey were also popular vedettes of the period.\n\nFrom the 1980s and 1990s stand out figures such as Lita Claver \"La Maña\"; Norma Duval, one of the last stars of the traditional magazine, a type of spectacle that during those years was in decline and that was maintained mainly thanks to the tourists who visited Paris; Tania Doris, another one of the last representatives of the sort in Spain ; Paloma Hurtado, María José Nieto \"Maripepa\", Rosa Valenty, Africa Pratt and the French Marlène Mourreau.\n\nIn the last years they have emphasized figures like La Terremoto de Alcorcón and the transsexual actresses ´Bibiana Fernandez, La Veneno and La Prohibida.\n\nRevue shows were popularized in Buenos Aires from the 1920s, mainly in the Teatro Maipo. Tita Merello became one of the most famous vedettes of the time.\n\nIn the 1950s vedettes of Cuban origin appeared, like Blanquita Amaro Amelia Vargas and Rosita Fornés. They had all the glitz, grace and glamor that characterized the era, and shared the stage with local stars like Nélida Roca.\n\nIn the 1960s appeared figures like Zulma Faiad, Nélida Lobato, Susana Brunetti, Norma Pons, Egle Martín and the Puerto Rican Iris Chacón, called the \"Vedette of America\".\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s gave way to other stars like Graciela Alfano and the sisters Ethel and Gogó Rojo. \nOthers who arose at that time and remained in force in the following years were Susana Giménez Moria Casán and Bettina Vardé.\n\nIn the 1990s, new vedettes appeared, some of whose fame would spread to the next decade, such as Cris Miró, María Fernanda Callejón, the Puerto Rican Lourdes Chacón and Monica Ayos.\n\nIn the first years of the 21st century there is a return of the revues in the Avenida Corrientes with figures like Florencia de la V, María Eugenia Ritó, Adabel Guerrero, and Valeria Archimó.\n\nThe image of the Vedette in Mexico arises from the beginning of the 20th century with the rise of the called \"Carpas\" and the Revues. Some venues such as Teatro Principal, the Teatro Colón and the Teatro Arbeu were considered as the cathedral of the revues and burlesque in Mexico City. There arise figures like Lupe Vélez, who, before being consecrated as a star in Hollywood, was considered one of the queens of the frivolous theater. The maximum figure of the time was Maria Conesa \"The White Kitten\", who also had a very long career spanning theater, film and television. Other outstanding figures of the time were Esperanza Iris, Celia Montalván, Lupe Rivas Cacho, Amparo Arozamena, Prudencia Grifell, Celia Padilla, Delia Magaña, Lupe Inclán, Aurora Walker, Amelia Wilhelmy and Mimí Derba, among others. Conesa, Montalván and Rivas Cacho, were even immortalized in a famous foxtrot called \"Mi querido capitán (My dear captain)\".\nIn the 1950s saw a resurgence of nightlife in Mexico City. Venues like the Tivoli, the Waikikí, the Margo (after the Teatro Blanquita), the Follies Bergere and the Teatro Lírico, among others, became the main forums for the blossoming of the vedettes. Special mention should be made of the \"Exoticas\", a group of vedettes that caused fury in Mexico's nightlife in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These \"Exoticas\" were characterized by using extravagant names, and their shows included African, Tahitian or Oriental dances. The most famous of the \"Exoticas\" was Yolanda Montes \"Tongolele\", one of the most important dancers of Latin America, and has been in force for more than sixty years. Together with \"Tongolele\", the most famous were Su Muy Key \"The Chinese Doll\", and Kalantan. Another famous \"Exóticas\" were Trudi Bora, Turanda, Joyce Cameron, Tanabonga, Tundra, Gemma, Eda Lorna, Kurumba, Bongala, Tula Montenegro, Brenda Conde, Josefina del Mar and Naná.\nParallel to the success of the Exoticas, they appear in Mexico the famous \"Rumberas\", dancers of Afro-American rhythms. The Rumberas managed to create their own cinematographic genre: The Rumberas film In the called Golden Age of Mexican cinema. The Rumberas films reflected in many of its arguments the life of the women in the night centers and cabarets. The main exponents of the genre were the Cubans María Antonieta Pons, Amalia Aguilar, Ninón Sevilla and Rosa Carmina as well the Mexican Meche Barba. \nThese women were complete vedettes who never needed to explicitly teach their bodies, captivating audiences only with their dances and other stage talents. The Rumberas also performed shows and live performances in important venues. With the decline of the Rumberas film in the mid-fifties, some rumberas broadened their horizons and ventured into vedette shows. Particularly remembered are the live shows of Amalia Aguilar and Rosa Carmina, who even filled stadiums in various countries in Central and South America.\nThe Cuban Rosita Fornés deserves special mention. She reaches the final consecration in Mexico before conquering the rest of the continent.\n\nIn the 1960s the splendor of the vedettes in Mexico lost force. Even so, worthy of mention are the shows offered in venues such as the Blanquita Theater or \"El Patio\" by the stars such as Sonia Furió, Ana Luisa Peluffo and Ana Bertha Lepe. In the midst of the fury of the Rock and Roll era, were famous figures like Malú Reyes and Emily Cranz. Actresses such as Jacqueline Voltaire and Irán Eory also performed shows as vedettes.\nThe 1970s and 1980s are considered the golden era of the vedettes in Mexico, thanks to a massive revival of nightlife in the country's capital. Mexico City was flooded with nightclubs, cabarets of all levels and burlesque theaters where the vedettes began to bloom. Among the most important nightclubs that illuminated the capital of the country are the Terazza Casino, the Capri (from the Hotel Regis), the Imperial, the Minuet, the Rio Rosa, La Fuente, El Conjunto Marrakech, La Copa de Champagne, El Cordiale, El Rondinella, El Clóset, El Quid, El 77, the Impala Bar and the Belvedere of the Hilton Continental Hotel. Some cabarets such as La Burbuja, Montparnasse, Las Fabulosas, El Can-Can, Los Globos, King Kong and Savoy also reached a great boom, while theaters like El Iris, El Blanquita and the Teatro Fru Fru presented burlesque shows, where the shows were more audacious and explicit. In addition, thanks to television, movies and magazines, the vedettes in Mexico reached their highest point of popularity. Many of them also ventured into the cinema, within the so-called Mexican sex comedy. \nOn the other hand, the popular television program \"Variedades de medianoche (Varieties of the Midnight)\" contributed to the boom of these women and launched to the fame to dozens of them.\n\nAmong the legendary vedettes that illuminated the nightlife of Mexico City are Olga Breeskin also known as \"Super Olga\" who achieved great fame for her spectacular performances where she danced surrounded by dancers and exotic animals while playing the violin; Angélica Chaín, who achieved fame first in magazines, then start a career as a vedette and finally consecrate herself in the cinema; Amira Cruzat, famous for her show known as \"The Dressing Room of Amira Cruzat\"; Lila Deneken \"The Number One\", important singer and the first Latin American star to present a show at the Monte-Carlo Sporting Club; the Argentine Zulma Faiad who settled in Mexico much of the decade of the 1970s and reached a great fame in cinema and night centers; Gloriella, popular star of the burlesque and numerous movies; Princesa Lea, very popular for presenting a show in which she bathed in a glass of champagne; Lyn May, of Chinese ancestry, pioneer of the nudes and one of the principal stars of the burlesque; Rossy Mendoza, known popularly as \"The Body\" or \"The Shorter Waist\", thanks to her impressive anatomy; Sasha Montenegro, who on par of her film career performed live shows that attracted the public because of her popularity; The Brazilian Gina Montes, famous by her appearance in a popular TV Show; Grace Renat, \"The Goddess of the Night\", Irma Serrano, who scandalized at the time with her controversial theatrical spectacles in the enclosure of her property, the Theater Fru-Frú; Wanda Seux, called \"The Golden Bomb\" and considered the \"Barbie\" of the vedettes for her thin figure and blonde hair; Thelma Tixou \"The Girl of the Golden Body\", native of Argentina, famous for her stature and imposing physique, and star for several years of the famous cabaret El Capri, Isela Vega, popular Mexican film actress, who scandalized audiences with her provocative shows in the stage, and Princesa Yamal, famous by her Arabian exotic dances.\n\nOther outstanding figures were Brigitte Aubé, Cleopatra, Alejandra del Moral, Mora Escudero, Gioconda, Ivonne Govea, Iris Cristal, Yolanda Liévana, Norma Lee, Mara Marú, Miss Melina Mey, Gina Morett, the transgender Jessica Muriel, Valeria Pani, Noelia Noel, Gabriela Ríos, Olga Ríos, Lina Santos, Merle Uribe and Judith Velasco Herrera, among many others.\n\nIn the year 2016, the filmmaker María José Cuevas made the documentary \"Beauties of the Night\", which portrays the life of five of these great vedettes.\n\nOne of the last great vedettes in Mexico was Francis García, a transvestite artist who was the main star of the Teatro Blanquita for more than a decade.\nIn recent years, large night centers have virtually disappeared from Mexico. Some actresses and singers perform shows of vedettes in other venues, such as the \"Palenques\". Among them are figures such as Costa Rican Maribel Guardia, Mexicans Lorena Herrera, Mariana Seoane, the transgender Alejandra Bogue and Ninel Conde and the Cubans Niurka Marcos and Lis Vega.\n\nThe term \"vedette\" is not commonly used in the United States or other Anglo-Saxon countries, (here called \"showgirls\"). Las Vegas is considered, after Paris, as the main venue for revue shows and musicals worldwide.\n\nThe British Lydia Thompson became a leading dancer and actress in burlesques on the London stage. She introduced Victorian burlesque to America with her troupe the \"British Blondes\", in 1868, to great acclaim and notoriety.\n\nOf the most famous American vedettes, stand out May Yohé, one of the most valued figures of the vaudeville at the beginning of the century; The aforementioned Josephine Baker, who ended up consecrating herself in France, where she was more popular than in her own country; Fanny Brice, star of the famous Ziegfeld Follies, queen of the theater, revues and later also star of cinema and the radio; Sally Rand, actress and dancer, specializing in fan dancing, which she popularized at the Paramount Club, and who because of the postures considered indecent she adopted with the dance was sometimes arrested. Also conceived the famous dance of the bubble; Zorita, famous for her shows where she played double roles and for her dances where she used boas and other exotic animals; Evelyn West, also known as \"The Hubba Hubba Girl\", a burlesque legend of the forties, fifties and sixties; Ann Corio, who also works in several Hollywood films; Mae West, who achieved tremendous fame, first in theater and then in Hollywood, where she scandalized censorship for her provocative behavior and spicy phrases. In the 1950s and 1960s, she achieved fame in her shows, which included groups of dancers and bodybuilders; Gypsy Rose Lee, immortalized in the famous autobiographical musical \"Gypsy\". Her innovations consisted of a casual style, against the spasmodic movements of other strippers (she emphasized the joke during the striptease) and brought a keen sense of humor to her performances. She was one of the main stars of the Minsky's Burlesque, with whom she worked four years. Working with the Minsky brothers was arrested several times. Another important figure of this time was Novita \"The Pixie of Burlesque\", one of the founders of the Exotic Dancers League (EDL).\nIn the 1960s and 1970s some burlesque figures peaked in the United States, particularly at the shows offered in Las Vegas. Of these are highlighted Tempest Storm, Lili St. Cyr, Blaze Starr, Tura Satana, Bambi Jones and Satan's Angel.\n\nThe most important in recent years has been Liza Minnelli\n\nToday, among the most famous vedettes in the United States are Dita Von Teese, who was the star of Crazy Horse, Julie Atlas Muz, Michelle L'amour, Catherine D'lish, Miss Dirty Martini, the British Immodesty Blaze, Angie Pontani, ,Jo Weldon and the Singaporean Sukki Singapora, the first international burlesque artist in Singapore. Singapora became the first burlesque artist in the world to be invited to tea at Buckingham Palace as a recognition of her contribution to the arts as an Asian model.\n\nOther prominent vedettes who have appeared in the world are the Puerto Rican Iris Chacón, the Brazilian Luz del Fuego, the Cubans Chelo Alonso and Rita Montaner, the Peruvian Amparo Brambilla and the Venezuelan Diosa Canales.\n\n\n\n"}

It retells incidents from the life of the Brythonic seer Merlin, and is based on traditional material about him.\n\nMerlin is described as a prophet in the text. There are a number of episodes in which he loses his mind and lives in the wilderness like a wild animal, like Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel, or the Welsh wild man of the woods. It is also the first work to describe the Arthurian sorceress Morgan le Fay, as \"Morgen\".\n\nGeoffrey had written of Merlin in his two previous works, the \"Prophetiae Merlini\", purporting to be a series of prophecies from the sage, and the \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", which is the first work presenting a link between Merlin and King Arthur.

Whereas the \"Historia\" had Merlin associating with Arthur, his father Uther Pendragon, and his uncle Ambrosius in the 5th century, the \"Vita\"'s timeframe is during the late 6th century, and includes references to various figures from that period, including Gwenddoleu and Taliesin.

Founded in 1901 by undergraduates at Yale University, the Dramat has been producing some of the finest student theatre in the United States for over a century.\n\nThough no formal theatre company existed at Yale during its first two centuries of existence, dramas and comedies were enjoyed by students from the earliest days. When Professor William Lyon Phelps, '87, commenced his teaching during the 1890s, he began a literary Renaissance that culminated in his sponsorship of the Dramatic Association, founded by Henry D. Wescott, Class of 1901, as a club for students interested in public performances of plays. The first meeting of the organization, chaired by Wescott, occurred on February 2, 1900.\n\nAs archivist Gerasimos Tsourapas described its first days: \"For its premiere production, the new organization chose \"The Second Shepherds' Play\", the medieval English comedy that offers both sacred and profane variation on the birth of Christ: the religious could take comfort in the play's theological interests; the secular could delight in the naughty pranks of the protagonist. All in all, a good choice to allay the fears of those distrustful of the theater. As if to reinforce the high moral tone of the inaugural performance, the Dramat Executive Committee added Wescott's own adaptation of Chaucer's \"The Pardoner's Tale\". Frank Lea Short, a New York theatrical figure, was hired to direct; Phelps and Professor Albert Cook served as literary advisors. Although both plays called for small casts, an \"audience-within-the-play\"— some one hundred extras—was placed on stage as well; no doubt someone realized the importance of getting as many people involved in the new venture as possible. On May 13, 1900, the first production of the Yale Dramatic Association opened to the universal applause of town and gown.\"\n\nCole Porter was undoubtedly the best-known of the Dramat's early Twentieth-Century figures. Not only did he perform both male and female roles, but he wrote and directed three \"smoker\" productions and composed the totemic song \"The Queen of the Yale Dramat\" (1911) satirizing drag roles. His first show, \"And Still the Villain Pursued Her\", poked fun at melodramas, while the second, \"Kaleidoscope\", was a send-up of college life.\n\nSince Porter's days the Dramat has fostered the careers of many distinguished actors in the World Premiere production of Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible\" in 1958, (in two acts) prior to Broadway. In 1960 Sam Waterston and Austin Pendleton starred in \"Waiting for Godot\". The Dramat was the first company to perform Thornton Wilder's one act play, \"The Long Christmas Dinner\".\n\nDuring the 1970s the company expanded its range and sophistication, with daring productions such as \"The Frogs\", a musical adaptation of the Aristophanes comedy by Stephen Sondheim and Burt Shevelove, staged in the pool of Payne Whitney Gymnasium. Ted Tally, a future Academy Award winning screenwriter for \"Silence of the Lambs\" starred opposite Alley Mills of television's The Wonder Years. While Meryl Streep trod the boards at the Drama School, Mark Linn-Baker and Robert Picardo delighted audiences on the Dramat stage.\n\nThe 1980s saw additional steps forward, with original works by undergraduates such as Tina Landau, class of 1984. Her \"In the Image of Kings\" was a provocative treatment of lunatic monarchs. Since then the Dramat has maintained its high standards with both classics and modern masterpieces, musicals, reviews, light operas, and the occasional spoof in the tradition of Porter. \n\nThe Dramat is run by a ten undergraduate member executive board which oversees the daily business of the Dramat, which includes selecting repertoire for performance and choosing or hiring directors for its productions. The Dramat's membership includes around 100 Yale undergraduates as well as many honorary and life-time members. \n\nThe Dramat played a large part in the founding of the Yale School of Drama and the construction of its main facility, the University Theater (also known as the UT).\n\n\n"}
