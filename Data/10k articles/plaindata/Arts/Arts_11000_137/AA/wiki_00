The children are carrying heavy burdens of wood for winter fuel. Though the title refers to the medieval poem \"Sir Isumbras\", the painting does not illustrate a scene from the original text. However Millais's friend, the writer Tom Taylor, wrote verse in a pastiche of the original poem, describing the event depicted. This was included in the original exhibition catalogue.\n\nThe background of the painting is based closely on a ruined medieval bridge which stood in Bridge of Earn, Perthshire (since demolished). Some of the village houses (in Back Street) can also be seen, though the tower house or castle to the left is imaginary.\n\nWhen first exhibited the painting was extremely controversial, and was attacked by many critics. Most notably, Millais's former supporter John Ruskin declared it to be a \"catastrophe\". The painting was also satirised in a print by Frederic Sandys, entitled \"A Nightmare\", in which Millais himself was represented as the knight. His fellow Pre-Raphaelites Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt were caricatured as the children, and the horse—transformed into a donkey—was branded with the initials of Ruskin.\n\nThe original poem describes an arrogant knight who is humbled by misfortune in his youth, a story derived from the Book of Job and the legend of Saint Eustace. The subject depicted by Millais portrays the elderly, now humble, Isumbras after the events narrated in the poem. It was described by Frederic George Stephens as follows,\n\n'Sir Isumbras at the Ford' was the subject of the picture Millais made his leading work in the year 1857. It represented an ancient knight, all clad in golden armour, who had gone through the glories of this life – war honour, victory and reward, wealth and pride. Though he is aged and worn with war, his eye is still bright with the glory of human life, and yet he has stooped his magnificent pride so far as to help, true knight as he was, two little children, and carries them over a river ford upon the saddle of his grand war-horse, woodcutter's children as they were. The face of this warrior was one of those pictorial victories which can derive their success from nothing less than inspiration. The sun was setting beyond the forest that gathered about the river's margin, and, in its glorious decadence, symbolised the nearly spent life of the warrior.\n\nThe theme of the Christian Chivalry was a topical one at the time, discussed by Ruskin himself and other authors such as Charles Kingsley, who saw it as a means to overcome class division. It is comparable to the hymn Good King Wenceslas, written in the same decade, which also describes an aristocrat helping peasants who have been gathering fuel. Millais was also probably influenced by Albrecht Dürer's print, .\n\n Critical commentary on the painting when it was first exhibited was largely hostile, with many critics finding the horse over-large and ugly and the expressions of the children exaggerated. Ruskin (whose wife Effie had left him for Millais a few years previously) was extremely savage, condemning the picture for making errors in \"pictorial grammar\" by portraying the foreground as lighter than the \"more exposed\" hills in the background. He insisted that Millais had suffered \"not just a fall—but catastrophe\".\n\nIn response, Millais attempted to repaint parts of the picture before he sent it to another exhibition in Liverpool. The repainted version won a prize at the Liverpool exhibition. Millais altered the picture again in the 1880s, adding decoration to the reins and bridle.\n\nDespite its early bad reception, the painting became quite influential, inspiring a number of other images of chivalric knights. It was also taken up by political caricaturists, who took their cue from Sandys's caricature to replace the figures with politicians of the day, suggesting alliances between mismatched forces in attempts to \"carry over\" some piece of legislation. This tradition continued well into the 20th century.\nSome of John Tenniel's work for the \"Alice\" stories of Lewis Carroll has been sourced to paintings: \"The White Knight echoes Millais's \"Sir Isumbras at the Ford\". \"\n\n"}

She graduated from Chatsworth High School in 1989. Borstein is a graduate of San Francisco State University, where she studied rhetoric. She was trained in improvisational comedy at the ACME Comedy Theatre, near Hollywood, California, and was selected to join \"MADtv\" after being scouted by talent agents who noticed her work at the theatre. She was a writer and voice actor for several television shows, including \"Casper\", \"Pinky and the Brain\", and \"Power Rangers Zeo\", before joining the cast of \"MADtv\" in 1997 as a featured player, becoming a repertory player mid-season.\n\nBorstein was born in Highland Park, Illinois, a suburb north of the city of Chicago, in 1973 (according to her own official website), though some sources still say 1971. She was raised in Deerfield, Illinois. Borstein has two elder brothers. Her parents, Irv and Judy Borstein, are both mental health professionals. Borstein is Jewish.\n\nHer father is from Atlanta, Georgia. Her mother, a Holocaust survivor, was born and raised in Budapest, Hungary, and moved to the United States after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Borstein attended San Francisco State University.\n\nBorstein trained in improv at the ACME Comedy Theater, where she met her writing partner and future husband Jackson Douglas. Shortly after they began working together on the animated series \"Casper\" and \"Pinky and the Brain\", Borstein left her position at an ad agency – where she had written print ads for Barbie – to become a full-time writer. In 1996, while still writing for \"Casper\", Borstein worked on the show \"Power Rangers Zeo\" as the voice of Queen Machina, the queen of the Machine Empire.\n\nIn 1997, Borstein became a cast member on the third season of the sketch comedy show \"MADtv\". She originally joined the cast as a featured player, but was upgraded to the repertory mid-season.\n\nBorstein was best known on \"MADtv\" for her character Ms. Swan; her other recurring characters included Eracist Anne, \"Stick Chick\" Echo, singer Jasmine Wayne-Wayne, child prodigy Karen Goddard, lounge singer Shaunda, \"News at Six\" outside-the-studio reporter Sue Napersville, and Cordo the GAP troll. When Seth Green made recurring appearances on the show as mean boss Mr. Brightling, Borstein would play his mother, Mama Brightling.\n\nWhile working on \"MADtv\", Borstein met Seth MacFarlane, who was then preparing to launch the animated sitcom \"Family Guy\" on FOX. MacFarlane was originally supposed to create animated shorts for \"MADtv\", but declined in favor of creating an independent series. MacFarlane cast Borstein as the voice of character Lois Griffin. After the show's debut in January 1999, \"Family Guy\" was cancelled by the network in 2002, but returned in 2005. As well as her role as the voice performer for Lois and several other characters (including a brief appearance as Ms. Swan in a 2005 episode), she is also a producer and staff writer. She was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for the episode \"Lois Comes Out of Her Shell\" in 2013.\n\nIn 2000, Borstein was cast as Sookie St. James in the WB drama \"Gilmore Girls\". She portrayed Sookie in the pilot, but her \"MADtv\" contract prevented her from continuing in the role, which was recast with Melissa McCarthy. Borstein made recurring appearances on \"Gilmore Girls\" throughout the show's run, first as the harpist Drella and later as the stylist Miss Celine.\n\nAs a film actress, she played the school principal in \"The Lizzie McGuire Movie\" (2003), the best friend of Halle Berry's character in \"Catwoman\" (2004), and an employee at CBS News in \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" (2005). She also had a small role in the movie \"Bad Santa\" (2003) and an uncredited cameo as an obnoxious coffee shop patron in the Will Ferrell movie \"Kicking & Screaming\" (2005). On some commercials, she sometimes voices Olive Oyl from Popeye and Betty Boop.\n\nBorstein was a co-host of GSN's \"Celebrity Blackjack\" in 2004. She made at least three guest appearances, once as Lois Griffin, on the Comedy Central animated program \"Drawn Together\".\n\nBorstein was cast as a press secretary in the 2007 sitcom pilot \"The Thick of It\", but the series was not picked up for broadcast. She was seen in the 2009 comedy \"For Christ's Sake\", which was directed by her real-life husband Jackson Douglas.\n\nBorstein's production company is called Crackerpants, Inc. In 2007, they released the DVD \"Drop Dead Gorgeous (in a Down-to-Earth Bombshell Sort of Way)\", a recording of a live performance at the Alex Theatre, with opening act Teddy Towne. The title comes from one of many actual female character breakdowns Borstein reads from to illustrate sexism in the industry.\n\nBorstein has made several supporting appearances in such comedic films as \"Killers\" (2010), \"Dinner for Schmucks\" (2010), \"Ted\" (2012), \"ParaNorman\" (2012), \"A Million Ways to Die in the West\" (2014), and \"The Angry Birds Movie\" (2016).\n\nIn 2010, Borstein joined the first season staff of the Showtime comedy-drama series \"Shameless\", as a writer and supervising producer. In its second season, she held the position of writer and consulting producer. She also guest starred as Lou Deckner in numerous episodes of the series, beginning in the first season episode \"But at Last Came a Knock\".\n\nShe also appeared as a comedian contestant on IFC's short-lived comedy-driven game show \"Bunk\" in 2012.\n\nBorstein later starred as Dawn Forchette on the HBO comedy series Getting On, which is a remake of a UK series of the same name. The series has gained positive reviews and earned multiple Primetime Emmy Award nominations. It aired from 2013 to 2015.\n\nBeginning in 2017, Borstein starred as Susie Myerson in the historical comedy-drama series \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\", for which she received significant critical acclaim and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nBorstein is divorced from actor and writer Jackson Douglas, whom she met while studying improv at the ACME Comedy Theatre. Douglas proposed to her during the taping of a \"MADtv\" skit; the couple married in 1999. Douglas filed for divorce in October 2014.\n\nIn the DVD commentary for the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Stewie Kills Lois\" – at the time she was pregnant – she joked about the possibility of naming her baby Stewie.

{"id": "1220524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1220524", "title": "Alfred Gilbert", "text": "Alfred Gilbert\n\nSir Alfred Gilbert (12 August 18544 November 1934) was an English sculptor and goldsmith who enthusiastically experimented with metallurgical innovations. He was a central — if idiosyncratic — participant in the New Sculpture movement that invigorated sculpture in Britain at the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nAlfred Gilbert's parents, Charlotte Cole and Alfred Gilbert, were musicians who lived at 13 Berners Street, London, where Alfred was born. He spent seven years at Aldenham School in Hertfordshire but received his artistic education mainly in Paris (Ecole des Beaux-Arts, under Jules Cavelier), and studied in Rome and Florence where the significance of the Renaissance made a lasting impression upon him and his art. He also worked in the studio of Sir Joseph Boehm, R.A.\n\nOn 3 January 1876 he married a first cousin, Alice Jane Gilbert (1847–1916), with whom he had eloped to Paris. They had five children. Bankruptcy made him flee from Britain in 1901 and for the next 25 years he settled in Bruges, Belgium. His wife left him in 1904. They never divorced, but lived separated, Alice being a patient in a mental hospital.\n\nAfter Alice's death in 1916, of which he received news only after the end of World War I, he married on 1 March 1919 his housekeeper Stéphanie Debourgh (1863–1937), widow of Alphonse Quaghebeur (1863–1903), a typesetter; she, previously a lacemaker, and six of her seven children had lived with Gilbert since 1907 and throughout the War and the German occupation of Belgium. As he was living underground, the presence of a large family was a good cover for the quantity of food needed in the household.\n\nGilbert traveled to Rome in 1923, where his fortunes improved, and three years later was able to return to England to complete the \"Clarence Memorial\", this time under the royal patronage and settled in the study of Lady Helena Gleichen. In that year he was commissioned to produce a final major work, the \"Queen Alexandra Memorial\" which was released in 1932. Gilbert was knighted for this work and was reelected to the RA, so his later years saw their full rehabilitation in the highest echelons of British artistic society, before his death at age 80 in 1934.\n\nHis first work of importance was the charming group of the Mother and Child, then The Kiss of Victory, followed by Perseus Arming (1883), produced directly under the influence of the Florentine masterpieces he had studied. Its success was great, and Lord Leighton forthwith commissioned Icarus, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1884, along with a remarkable Study of a Head, and was received with general applause. Then followed \"The Enchanted Chair,\" which, along with many other works deemed by the artist incomplete or unworthy of his powers, was ultimately broken by the sculptors own hand.\n\nIn 1888 was produced the statue of Queen Victoria, set up at Winchester, in its main design and in the details of its ornamentation the most remarkable work of its kind produced in Great Britain, and perhaps, it may be added, in any other country in modern times. In 1892–1893 Gilbert was occupied with the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, in Piccadilly Circus, London, a work of great originality and beauty representing Anteros. Other statues are those set up to Lord Reay in Bombay, and John Howard at Bedford (1898). Gilbert rose to the full height of his powers in his memorials to the Duke of Clarence and to Lord Arthur Russell and a memorial font to the son of the 4th Marquess of Bath.\n\nGilbert produced the tomb, in St George's Chapel, Windsor, of the Duke of Clarence, described as \"the finest single example of late 19th-century sculpture in the British Isles\". A recumbent effigy of the Prince in a Hussar uniform (almost impossible to see properly \"in situ\") lies above the tomb. Kneeling over him is an angel, holding a heavenly crown. The tomb is surrounded by an elaborate railing, with figures of saints. The perfectionist Gilbert spent too much on the commission, which was the cause of his bankruptcy and leaving the country. Five of the smaller figures were only completed with \"a greater roughness and pittedness of texture\" after his return to Britain in the 1920s.\n\nIn addition to the work already cited he produced busts of Cyril Flower, John R. Clayton (since broken up by the artist, the fate of much of his admirable work), G. F. Watts, Sir Henry Tate, Sir George Birdwood, Sir Richard Owen, Sir George Grove and various others. He designed the statue of David Davies of Llandinam in front of the Barry Docks Offices.\n\nGilbert was chosen associate of the Royal Academy in 1887, full member in 1892 (resigned 1909), and professor of sculpture (afterwards resigned) in 1900. He was a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers. In 1889 he won the Grand Prix at the Paris International Exhibition. He was created a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1897. While Gilbert was known for his sculpture, he also periodically made oil paintings.\n\n\n\n"}

This happens when they seek external technologies for their business or external markets for their own technologies. It has implications for the value of technology and innovations as well as their development by more than one firm and for the need for and limitations of patent protection.\n\nArrow's information paradox theory was set out in a 1962 paper. Cornell Law School professor Oskar Liivak has written in a paper for a conference at Stanford University that Arrow's \"paper has been one of the foundational theoretical pillars of the incentive based theory of patents as Arrow’s work is thought to rule out a strictly market-based solution.\"\n\nA fundamental tenet of the paradox is that the customer, i.e. the potential purchaser of the information describing a technology (or other information having some value, such as facts), wants to know the technology and what it does in sufficient detail as to understand its capabilities or have information about the facts or products to decide whether or not to buy it.\n\nOnce the customer has this detailed knowledge, however, the seller has in effect transferred the technology to the customer without any compensation. This has been argued to show the need for patent protection.\n\nIf the buyer trusts the seller, or is protected via contract, then they only need to know the results that the technology will provide, along with any caveats for its usage in a given context. A problem is that sellers lie, they may be mistaken, one or both sides overlook side consequences for usage in a given context, or some unknown unknown affects the actual outcome.\n\nDiscussions of the value of patent rights have taken Arrow's information paradox into account in their evaluations. The theory has been the basis for many later economic studies. These include theories that pre-patent innovation can be carried out only by a single firm.\n\n\n"}

The organisation’s work includes an annual festival of films by women filmmakers, held in London, as well as a touring programme and year-round training and career development programmes for emerging women filmmakers in the UK. \nIn addition to promoting work by women filmmakers, Birds Eye View aims to educate audiences about the importance of diversity in film, and to widen the audiences for women-made films and world cinema.\n\nFounded as a short film event in 2002, Birds Eye View registered as a charity in 2004, launched the UK’s first major women’s film festival in 2005, and now operates year-round activity through its BEV Labs, First Weekenders Club, touring programme and online community, in addition to an annual festival in London. Prominent filmmakers and artists to have worked with Birds Eye View include Kim Longinotto, Lucy Walker, Wanuri Kahiu, Mary Harron, Bella Freud, Drew Barrymore, Susanne Bier, Peace Anyiam-Fiberesima, Tracey Emin, Xiao Jiang, Andrea Arnold, Gillian Wearing, Beeban Kidron and Marilyn Gaunt.\n\nFor each annual festival, Birds Eye View commissions and produces Sound & Silents, a live-music event whereby leading female musicians perform live, specially-written sets to classic silent films. Musicians to have participated in Sound & Silents include Imogen Heap, Natalie Clein, Bishi, Mira Calix, Patti Plinko, Gwyneth Herbert, The Elysian Quartet, Zoe Rahman, Broken Hearts DJs and JUICE.\n\nThe dates for the 7th Birds Eye View Film Festival have been announced as 8 – 17 March 2011, held at BFI Southbank (British Film Institute) and the ICA (Institute of Contemporary Arts). The programme will include a strand exploring the contribution of women directors and screenwriters to the horror genre, entitled Bloody Women, presented in conjunction with Film 4 FrightFest.\n\nBirds Eye View’s Director is co-founder Rachel Millward. Millward is currently the Clore Fellow for Film, and was named as one of 50 \"Women to Watch\" by Arts Council England and the Cultural Leadership Programme, and previously nominated as a ‘World Changing Woman' (The Guardian, 21.08.06). \nBirds Eye View is chaired by producer Elizabeth Karlsen (\"The Crying Game\", \"Little Voice\", \"Made in Dagenham\"), and patrons include Mike Figgis, Mira Nair, Joanna Lumley, Juliet Stevenson, Martha Fiennes, Stephen Woolley and Gurinder Chadha.\n\nHighlights of the Birds Eye View Film Festival programme typically tour the UK throughout the year, playing at regional cinemas such as the Manchester Cornerhouse and Glasgow Film Theatre, as well as music and arts festivals including Big Chill and Latitude. The most common touring programmes include screenings of silent films with new live scores by female musicians, which BEV regularly commissions as part of its Sound & Silents programme. The Festival also takes special events to the Edinburgh and Cannes international film festivals.\n\nThe Birds Eye View Awards are presented annually to the best feature, documentary and short films screened at the Festival, as selected by juries of leading industry figures and film critics.\n\nBirds Eye View's training programmes are called the BEV Labs, made up of specialised intensive training programmes designed to develop new female filmmaker talent and bring new feature films by women into production. 2009's lab 'Last Laugh: Women Create Comedy' saw three comedy feature films from female writers taken onto the Warp X / Warp Films development slates, including work from Sally Phillips, Julia Davis and Lucy Porter. These films are currently in development. \nOngoing Labs include She Writes in partnership with The Script Factory and Re:Animate in partnership with Warp Films, providing leading female screenwriters and animators with mentoring, industry events and creative support to help advance their projects towards pitching for development slates.\n\nBirds Eye View seeks to promote films made by women through its First Weekenders Club, based on the premise that audiences, and therefore box office, from the opening weekend of a film's theatrical release has a huge impact on its future and on the future of the filmmaker. The First Weekenders Club therefore promotes the first weekend of new releases by women filmmakers. The campaign has received backing from key figures in the film industry including director Gurinder Chadha and Natasha Walter of the Guardian.\n\n\n"}

He admits himself into people's homes, by pretending to be a relative or an official, and persuading his victims to give him a night's free board: He finds at first a lunch at the horrible couple Dumont (Jean-Pierre Bisson and Maike Jansen), where a thief follows him for a robbery. Alex spent an evening in front of TV at Marie (Marie-Christine Barrault from \"Cousin, cousine\"), mother of seven children. He runs from Marie to find an evening and a new bed at the home of charming but shy lesbian Caroline (Claude Jade from \"Bed and Board\") and her funny lover Gloria (Corinne Le Poulain from \"The Provocation\"). \nTo save her inheritance, Caroline - accused for her homosexuality by her horrible sister Catherine (Laurence Vincendon) - tells her aunt Amélie (Monique Darpy), that Gloria is her secretary and Alex her lover. So Alex has to present himself nude in Caroline's bed. He saves Carolines inheritance.\nThe police officers (Jean-Claude Dreyfus from \"Delicatessen\") investigating the case are so terminally stupid that Alex has little chance of being arrested.\n\nAs in many of Jean-Pierre Mocky's films, there is a strong anti-establishment, almost anarchist sub-text. This is manifested in the way that the self-proclaimed moral figures (the police, the clergy, even the President of the Republic) are presented in this film, but also in the elevation of Alex Ponttin (Michel Serrault) to the status of a public hero at the end of the film. Whilst society and state sink into a numbing inertia, bereft of integrity and humanity, it is left to the eccentrics, the outsiders like worried Caroline (Claude Jade), who is attacked by her sister and her aunt because the secret of her homosexuality, to build a more cohesive society and a better world.\nMichel Serrault excels in this off-the-wall satirical comedy which makes a bizarre assessment of modern life. He plays an impish vagrant who uses his new-found freedom to improve the lives of his fellow man, by briefly insinuating himself into their lives. Bonsoir goes much further and suggests that whole of modern society, not only the police, is culpable of mediocrity and moral laxity. It takes an outsider like Alex Ponttin, free from the bonds of modern living, to point the way to a better future.\n\n\n\n"}

The company has evolved into a player in the luxury market, with an established and growing network of stores.\n\nThe trademark is usually written BVLGARI in the classical Latin alphabet, and is derived from the surname of the company's founder Sotirios Voulgaris (1857-1932, , ). The root of the surname Voulgaris is Βούλγαρ (\"Voulgar\"), which in Greek translates as \"Bulgarian\". In Italy he changed it to Bulgari, which although different, further emphasizes the same meaning and translates as \"Bulgarians\" or people of Bulgarian descent in Italian. \n\nThe BVLGARI logo was used for the first time in 1934, when its gilded brass letters graced the central doorway of the Via Condotti flagship. In reference to ancient Rome, the “U” was replaced with the letter “V”, and a logo was born. Since then, the trademark is written BVLGARI in the classical Latin alphabet.\n\nThe Voulgaris were a silversmithing family from the Epirus region of Ottoman Greece. Whether or not the Voulgaris family of Corfu and the Voulgaris family of the Italian jewelers Bulgari from Epirus share the same paternal line is unclear, but the count Stefanos Voulgaris denied that the Bulgari family of the Italian jewelers family is genealogically related to the Voulgaris family of Corfu. According to chronicles of the Voulgaris family written in Venetian Corfu, the \"Voulgaris family of Saint Spyridon of Corfu\" descend from the royal figures of barbarian peoples from the Volga river, who \"finally settled in Moesia near the Haemus mountains\", so the founding father of this family was described as the \"Triballian\" (de facto Serbian) Prince Stefan Lazarevic in the 16th century testemant of the family, becoming such by taking refugee in the Venetian island Corfu.\n\nThe founder of the Bulgari brand is Sotirios Bulgari (, ) who was born in March 1857 in the Aromanian village Kalarites, Ottoman Empire and was one of eleven children of his father Georgios Voulgaris(1823-1889) and his Aromanian mother Eleni Stronggaris. In 1881, Sotirios Bulgari moved to Rome and, in 1884, opened his first store on via Sistina 85. In 1888, he married Aromanian Eleni Basio with whom he had six children: Constantine-Georgios(1889-1973), Leonidas-Georgios(1890-1966), Maria-Athena(1891-1976), Sofia(1893-1908), Alexandra(1895-1984) and Spyridon(1897-1932), so Leonidas-Georgios is the father of the current chairman of the company Paolo Bulgari. In 1905, he unveiled the Via Condotti shop that would become the company’s flagship. In its early years, Bvlgari was known for silver pieces that borrowed elements from Byzantine and Islamic art, combining them with floral motifs. At the time, Paris was the apex of fashion and creativity, and its trends influenced Sotirio’s designs for decades: jewels of the early 20s were characterised by platinum Art Deco settings while those of the 30s featured geometric diamond motifs—sometimes set in combination with coloured gemstones. Convertible jewels were also popular during the time, and one of Bvlgari’s major piece was the \"Trombino\", a small trumpet-shaped ring.\n\nIn 1932, Sotirio passed away, leaving the business to his two sons, Giorgio (1890–1966) and Costantino (1889–1973), who each had a keen interest in precious stones and jewels. During the Second World War, most new jewellery was crafted out of gold, as gems were scarce, and designs became more natural feeling. As the 40s came to a close, Bvlgari introduced \"Serpenti\" bracelet-watches.\n\nIn the 50s, some of Bvlgari best-known clients included Elizabeth Taylor, Anna Magnani, Ingrid Bergman and Gina Lollobrigida as Rome earned a reputation as \"Hollywood on the Tiber\" with the Cinecittà studios.\n\nAt the same time, Bvlgari went to a new style. The post-war boom saw a return to precious materials, particularly white metals covered in diamonds. In the 50s, Bvlgari launched its first floral brooches—called \"en tremblant\" because of their trembling diamond corollas. At the end of the 50s, Bvlgari began to establish its motifs, introducing structured, symmetrical shapes in yellow gold set with brilliant gems—chosen for their colour rather than intrinsic value. Among these multi-hued jewels, cabochon cuts were another innovation. These new pieces were a significant departure from classical Parisian design.\nAfter Giorgio's death in 1966, his son Gianni led the company as co-chief executive with his cousin Marina. \n\nDuring the 1970s, Bvlgari stores opened in New York, Geneva, Monte Carlo and Paris. This era marks the beginning of the Group’s international expansion, with Gianni as chairman and CEO. A number of new motifs made their debut as well—jewels became recognisable for their angular forms, strong colours, oval elements with cabochons, chains and maxi sautoirs, whilst the predominant use of yellow gold made precious pieces feel all the more wearable, and became known as a Bvlgari trademark. In 1977, Bvlgari entered the world of horlogerie with the launch of the \"BVLGARI BVLGARI\" watch. At the time, Gianni led a complete overhaul of the company, focusing on product design. \n\nIn the early 80s, to oversee all production of Bvlgari watches, Bvlgari Time was founded in Switzerland. In 1984, Paolo and Nicola Bulgari, Giorgio’s sons, became Chairman and Vice-Chairman, respectively, while their nephew, Francesco Trapani, became Chief Executive Officer. In 1985, Gianni resigned as CEO and in 1987, he left the family business after selling his one-third stake in the company to his brothers Nicola and Paolo.\n\nBvlgari diversified its brand in 1993 with the launch of its first fragrance, \"Eau Parfumée au\" \"The Vert\" and the founding of Bvlgari Parfums in Switzerland to oversee the creation and production of all perfumes. In 1995, Bvlgari pushed ahead with an aggressive programme for growth, becoming listed on the Milan Stock Exchange for the first time. In 1996, the brand launched its first accessories collection, beginning with silk scarves before developing a range of leather accessories and eyewear. In 1999, the brand launched the B.zero1 ring.\n\nThe company has seen 150% revenue growth between 1997 and 2003.\n\nThe year 2000 was the beginning of an increasingly aggressive period of verticalization for Bvlgari, with the acquisition of the luxury watchmaking brands Daniel Roth and Gérald Genta, followed by the takeover of the jewellery firm Crova and of other companies that specialised in leather goods and watchmaking. The opening of the first Bvlgari Hotel in Milan in 2004 further confirmed the expansion strategy of the brand, and was the result of a joint venture with Luxury Group, a division of Marriot International. In 2009, Bvlgari celebrated its 125th anniversary with a retrospective of the brand’s history, held in Rome at Palazzo delle Esposizioni. That same year, the snake—a motif that appeared in Bvlgari collections from the 1960s—re-emerged as the emblem of the \"Serpenti\" collection. In 2011, Bvlgari signed a strategic alliance with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, the world’s leading luxury group. The agreement was based on a stock transfer of the Bulgari family's shares in Bvlgari S.p.A. to LVMH, an all-share deal for €4.3 billion ($6.01 billion), higher than LVMH had offered for any other company. Under the deal, the Bulgari family sold their 50.4 per cent controlling stake in exchange for 3 per cent of LVMH, thereby becoming the second-biggest family shareholder behind the Arnaults in LVMH. The takeover doubled the size of LVMH’s watches and jewellery unit, which at the time of the acquisition included Tag Heuer timepieces and De Beers diamond necklaces. The acquisition concluded on 4 October 2011 as Bulgari was delisted from the Borsa Italiana.\n\nIn 2014, Bvlgari celebrated the 130th anniversary of the brand. To mark the occasion, the shop at Via Condotti 10 was \"reimagined\" by the architect Peter Marino, and reopened. On the same day, the brand donated € 1.5 million to the city of Rome for the restoration of the Spanish Steps. A few months after the Grand Opening, the DOMVS was inaugurated in the redesigned Bvlgari boutique, creating a gallery space to house of Bvlgari’s Heritage Collection.\n\nIn 2017, Bvlgari opened a new jewellery manufacturing headquarters in Valenza. The largest in Europe, with a total area of 14,000sqm, the Manufacture has been given a Gold LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certification for sustainability in its design. The facility was built over the former home of the first goldsmith in Valenza, Francesco Caramora. The buildings follow the model of a Roman domus, and are built around a central courtyard.\n\nBvlgari’s jewellery collections include \"B.zero1, Divas’ Dream, Serpenti, BVLGARI BVLGARI, Parentesi,\" and a bridal line. \n\nBvlgari’s watches collections include \"Octo, BVLGARI BVLGARI, Diagono\" and \"Haute Horlogerie\" creations for men, and \"LVCEA, Serpenti, Divas’ Dream, BVLGARI BVLGARI, B.zero1\" and High Jewellery timepieces for women. It mixes Italian design and Swiss watchmaking. The company's Swiss subsidiary, Bvlgari Haute Horlogerie SA, is responsible for Bvlgari watch production. It was founded in 1980 and is headquartered in Neuchâtel. Bvlgari Haute Horlogerie SA employs about 500 people.\n\nBvlgari’s fragrance assortment includes \"Goldea, Splendida\" and \"Omnia\" for women, \"Bvlgari Man, Aqua\", \"the Classics\", and \"Blv Pour Homme\" for men, whilst \"Bvlgari Le Gemme\" and \"Eau Parfumée\".\n\nThe creation of Bvlgari accessories and leather goods is handled in the Bvlgari atelier in Florence. Twice a year, Bvlgari presents its latest collections at Milan Fashion Week, debuting them at the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter shows.\n\nIn 2001, Bvlgari S.p.A. formed a joint venture with \"Luxury Group\", the Luxury Division of Marriott International, to launch Bvlgari Hotels & Resorts, a collection of hotels and resort destinations around the world. Their distinctive settings and Italian design by the architectural firm Antonio Citterio-Patricia Viel characterise the properties of Bvlgari Hotel Group. Having grown from a curated collection of three—Milan (opened in 2004), Bali (2006) and London (2012)—the Bvlgari Hotels & Resorts portfolio has recently added Beijing (2017), Dubai (2017) and Shanghai (2018) properties. There are three additional Hotels in the works, with Moscow, Paris and Tokyo slated to open between 2020 and 2022.\n\nBvlgari relies on a distribution network of about 300 stores. The largest Bvlgari store in the world is the 10-story Bvlgari Ginza Tower in Tokyo, 940 square meters of retail floor space, including a restaurant and lounge bar.\n\nNorth American Bvlgari boutiques and distributors are found in Aspen, Atlanta, Beverly Hills, Bal Harbour, Boca Raton, Bethesda (Chevy Chase), Charlotte, Chicago, Costa Mesa, Dallas, Honolulu, Houston, King of Prussia, New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Cabo San Lucas. Mx, Montreal, Palm Beach, San Francisco, Short Hills, and Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nSouth American Bvlgari distributors are found in Lima, Bogotá, São Paulo, Margarita island & Quito.\n\nIn 2009, Bvlgari takes action on behalf of disadvantaged children around the world through a partnership with Save the Children. The brand launched a campaign which included the launch of a Save the Children custom-designed jewellery collection, of which a portion of the proceeds went to the charity. As of 2018, Bvlgari’s contribution has totalled 80 million dollars.\n"}

Initially founded in October 2002 by Roger Hartley and Claire Horan, registered at Companies House. In 2016 they further expanded to become a CIC Trust Organisation. The Bureau of Silly Ideas is funded by Arts Council England and headquartered in Brixton, London.\n\nThe majority of their work is in collaboration with local government councils across the United Kingdom, in addition to commissions from a variety of heritage sites and festivals across the world. They are also members of National Association of Street Artists and the Independent Street Arts Network. They were the first company to combine circus performance under the veil of construction work - transforming everyday objects into unassuming props or using radio controlled robotics.\n\nThe Bureau of Silly Ideas was founded in October 2002 by Roger Hartley, an artist who was predominantly interested in performance in public spaces. He was interested by the fictitious transformation of everyday objects and what he saw, as their ability to unequivocally connect with individuals. This was inspired by a show in 1997 that Roger began to work on with Simon Collins to create a show based on Don Quixote with life size fire breathing robot horses and radio controlled wheelie bins. Roger had early experience in transforming spaces as he invented and launched ‘Lost Vagueness’ a pop up working casino and Cabaret with strict dress code that would appear in places not used to dress code. Roger and BOSI continue to infiltrate festivals but with interactive art.\n\nRoger was approached by Arts Council England to present ideas for street circus, theater and carnival; which has recently been accepted as forms of Art by the council. His proposition was performances that juxtaposed circus and funfair against construction sites and roadworks, which involved transforming these everyday objects and activities. His purpose was to engage people with their communities development in a fun and memorable way, in order to change their perception of something they may have otherwise found frustrating.\n\nRoger received funding from Arts Council England and created the Bureau of Silly Ideas and the company's first show ‘The Hole Job’.\n\nIn 2008 The Bureau of Silly Ideas produced a show called ‘Big Oriental Squid Inc’ (BOSI) which was also an officially registered subsidiary company. The styling of performance names using the same acronym ‘BOSI’ has become a hallmark of their work. This show demonstrated an important artistic shift from concentrating on everyday objects to everyday companies. Pushing and exploring legal boundaries and exploring the public's reaction to fictitious but official companies. They were the first to use a cross-media approach for the narrative of a public art event, 2008 – Burst Pipe Dream in Brighton. Utilizing social media, fake news and company Big Oriental Squid Inc to provoke public backlash before unveiling the entire show as fictitious and for fun and then engaged them in the final performance. Subtly hitting multiple politically fused subjects.\n\nIn 2016 Roger Hartley and BOSI worked as first resident artist for Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Which culminated in the creation of the United Nations Board of Significant Inspiration (UNBOSI) and the ‘Garden of Curious Amusement’ in Stratford-upon-Avon.\"BOSI were an inspirational partner to work with, engaging in a really constructive dialogue with the SBT on exciting and unique project ideas, and then delivering a successful activity that met with excellent customer feedback from audience members who were both surprised and delighted with their experience.” Dr Delia Garratt (Director of Cultural Engagement SBT)The UNBOSI project is continuing and has recently partnered with CPP Marketplace to conduct shows across the East Anglia area of the UK.\n\nThe Bureau of Silly Ideas was founded in 2002 by Roger Hartley, who wanted to address the issue of fracturing communities within an increasingly connected and globalized world. The fundamental belief of the company is that the creation of, and access to, art is a pathway out of urban poverty traps. The method of exacting this belief was through Conceptual and Process Art performances; that transposed the 'everyday' into surprising and immersive experiences \"taking a magnifier to Duchamp urinal and extrapolating its essence, to a much greater scale\" - Roger Hartley. The aim was to combat the loss of community involvement by creating shows that stripped back community development, such as construction and attempt to change the perception of them from interference to interactive; therefore bonding a community more closely with its refurbishment.\n\nThe Burst Pipe Dream was a 7-day installation that took place in 2008 at Brighton's Jubilee Square, under the guise of a subsidiary company called 'Big Oriental Squid Inc'. The purpose of the event is described by BOSI asThe story that Brighton would be welcoming Europe’s first Giant Squid Farm in newly developed, Jubilee Square. Created with two core aims in mind, the primary being community cohesion - the building of Jubilee Square had overrun and as such caused a discourse in the relationship between construction, public space and community. The second was to respond to the overfishing of our oceans by highlighting the role of corporations, who put profit before the planet. Since its' conception in 2008, BOSinc has visited various towns. The Burst Pipe Dream is currently being redeveloped for a national seaside town tour in 2020.The Bureau of Silly Ideas collaborated with Brighton Festival for the event. The event attracted attention from the general public and local news.\n\nUnited Nations Board of Significant Inspiration is a fictitious department of the United Nations, created by the Bureau of Silly Ideas and is collaborating with Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. In Christmas 2016, a light show called 'Garden of Curious A-MUSE-ments' was performed and involved the imbuing of marbles with inspiration.\n\nFull list of shows as given on the Bureau of Silly Ideas website\n\n"}
{"id": "27691317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27691317", "title": "Classic book", "text": "Classic book\n\nA \"classic\" is a book accepted as being exemplary or noteworthy, for example through an imprimatur such as being listed in a list of great books, or through a reader's personal opinion. Although the term is often associated with the Western canon, it can be applied to works of literature from all traditions, such as the Chinese classics or the Indian Vedas.\n\nWhat makes a book \"classic\" is a concern that has occurred to various authors ranging from Italo Calvino to Mark Twain and the related questions of \"Why Read the Classics?\" and \"What Is a Classic?\" have been essayed by authors from different genres and eras (including Calvino, T. S. Eliot, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve). The ability of a classic book to be reinterpreted, to seemingly be renewed in the interests of generations of readers succeeding its creation, is a theme that is seen in the writings of literary critics including Michael Dirda, Ezra Pound, and Sainte-Beuve.\n\nThe terms \"classic book\" and \"Western canon\" are closely related concepts, but they are not necessarily synonymous. A \"canon\" refers to a list of books considered to be \"essential\" and is presented in a variety of ways. It can be published as a collection (such as Great Books of the Western World, Modern Library, or Penguin Classics), presented as a list with an academic’s imprimatur (such as Harold Bloom's) or be the official reading list of an institution of higher learning (such as \"The Reading List\" at St. John's College or Rutgers University.\n\nIn the 1980s, Italo Calvino said in his essay \"Why Read the Classics?\" that \"a classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say\" and comes to the crux of personal choice in this matter when he says (italics in the original translation): \"\"Your\" classic author is the one you cannot feel indifferent to, who helps you define yourself in relation to him, even in dispute with him.\" Consideration of what makes a literary work a classic is for Calvino ultimately a personal choice, and, constructing a universal definition of what constitutes a Classic Book seems to him to be an impossibility, since, as Calvino says \"There is nothing for it but for all of us to invent our own ideal libraries of classics.\"\n\nWhat actually makes a work of literature a \"classic book\" is not just a consideration of extensively published authors. In 1920, Fannie M. Clark, a teacher at the Rozelle School in East Cleveland, Ohio, predates Calvino's similar conclusions by 60 years when she also essayed the question of what makes a book a \"classic\" in her article \"Teaching Children to Choose\" in \"The English Journal\".\n\nOver the course of her essay, Clark considers the question of what makes a piece of literature a classic and why the idea of \"the classics\" is important to society as a whole. Clark says that \"teachers of English have been so long trained in the 'classics' that these 'classics' have become to them very much like the Bible, for the safety of which the rise of modern science causes such unnecessary fears.\" She goes on to say that among the sources she consulted was a group of eighth-graders when she asked them the question: \"What do you understand by the classics in literature?\" Two of the answers Clark received were \"Classics are books your fathers give you and you keep them to give to your children\" and \"Classics are those great pieces of literature considered worthy to be studied in English classes of high school or college\". Calvino agrees with the Ohio educator when he states \"Schools and universities ought to help us understand that no book that talks about a book says more than the book in question, but instead they do their level best to make us think the opposite.\" Clark and Calvino come to a similar conclusion that when a literary work is analyzed for what makes it 'classic', that in just the act of analysis or as Clark says \"the anatomical dissection\", the reader can end up destroying the unique pleasure that mere enjoyment a work of literature can hold.\n\nWhile blogging on the website guardian.co.uk in 2009, Chris Cox echoes Twain's \"classic\" sentiments of 1900 and Bennett's witticism about classic books when he opined on the Guardian.Co \"Books Blog\" that there are actually two kinds of \"classic novels\":\nThe first are those we know we should have read, but probably have not. These are generally the books that make us burn with shame when they come up in conversation... The second kind, meanwhile, are those books that we've read five times, can quote from on any occasion, and annoyingly push on to other people with the words: \"You have to read this. It's a classic.\"\nIn 1850, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve (1804–1869) stated his answer to the question \"What is a Classic?\" (\"Qu'est-ce qu'un classique?\"): The idea of a classic implies something that has continuance and consistence, and which produces unity and tradition, fashions and transmits itself, and endures…. A true classic, as I should like to hear it defined, is an author who has enriched the human mind, increased its treasure, and caused it to advance a step; who has discovered some moral and not equivocal truth, or revealed some eternal passion in that heart where all seemed known and discovered; who has expressed his thought, observation, or invention, in no matter what form, only provided it be broad and great, refined and sensible, sane and beautiful in itself; who has spoken to all in his own peculiar style, a style which is found to be also that of the whole world, a style new without neologism, new and old, easily contemporary with all time.\n\nIn this same essay, Sainte-Beuve quoted Goethe (referring to the 'classics' concept): \"Ancient works are classical not because they are old, but because they are powerful, fresh, and healthy.\"\n\nThe concept of 'the classic' was a theme of T.S. Eliot's literary criticism as well. In The Sacred Wood he thought that one of the reasons \"Dante is a classic, and Blake only a poet of genius was \"because of \"the concentration resulting from a framework of mythology and theology and philosophy\". (In commenting about Eliot's influence, Professor Jan Gorak stated that \"the idea of a canon has become intertwined with the idea of the classic, an idea that T.S. Eliot tried to revitalize for the 'modern experiment'\".) In echoes of Sainte-Beuve, Eliot gave a speech to the Virgil Society concerning himself with the very same question of \"What is a Classic?\" In his opinion, there was only one author who was 'classic': \"No modern language can hope to produce a classic, in the sense I have called Virgil a classic. Our classic, the classic of all Europe, is Virgil.\" In this instance, though, Eliot said that the word had different meanings in different surroundings and that his concern was with \"one meaning in one context\". He states his focus is to define only \"one kind of art\" and that it does not have to be \"better...than another kind\". His opening paragraph makes a clear distinction between his particular meaning of classic having Virgil as the classic of all literature and the alternate meaning of classic as \"a standard author\".\n\nLiterary figures from different eras have also weighed in (sometimes humorously) on the matter. Alan Bennett, the modern English playwright and author, said that \"Definition of a classic: a book everyone is assumed to have read and often thinks they have read themselves.\" Mark Van Doren, the Columbia University professor and poet, is quoted by Jim Trelease (in his library-monograph \"Classic Picture Books All Children Should Experience\"), as saying that \"A classic is any book that stays in print\". And in his \"Disappearance of Literature\" speech given over a century ago in 1900, Mark Twain said, (referring to a learned academic's lofty opinion of Milton's \"Paradise Lost\") that the work met the Professor's definition of a classic as \"something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read\".\n\nClassics are often defined in terms of their lasting freshness. Clifton Fadiman thought that the works that become classic books have their start in childhood, saying that \"If you wish to live long in the memory of men, you should not write for them at all. You should write what their children will enjoy.\" In his view, the works we now judge to be classics are \"great starters\". Fadiman unites classic books through the ages in a continuum (and concurs with Goethe's thoughts on the vigor and relevance of the ancient Classics), when he states that classic books share a \"quality of beginningness\" with the legendary writer of the Iliad and the Odyssey – Homer himself. Ezra Pound in his own tome on reading, \"ABC of Reading\", gave his opinion when he stated, \"A classic is classic not because it conforms to certain structural rule, or fits certain definitions (of which its author had quite probably never heard). It is classic because of a certain eternal and irrepressible freshness.\" Michael Dirda, the 1993 Pulitzer Prize winning critic, concurred with Pound's view regarding the vitality of a classic when he wrote that \"...one of the true elements of a classic\" was that \"they can be read again and again with ever-deepening pleasure.\"\n\nPublishing houses (e.g., Easton Press, Franklin Library, and Folio Society) and colleges/universities (such as Oxford University Press and Yale University Press) are at times in the business of classic books. Publishers have their various types of \"classic book\" lines, while colleges and universities have required reading lists as well as associated publishing interests. If these books are the works of literature that well-read people are supposed to have read or at least be familiar with, then the genesis of the classic book genre and the processes through which texts are considered for selection (or not) is of interest. The development of the Penguin Classics line of books, among the best-known of the classic imprints, can serve as a good example.\n\nPenguin Books, the parent company of Penguin Classics, had its inception during the 1930s when the founder, Allen Lane, was unable to find a book he actually wanted to read while at Exeter train station. As the company website tells it, \"appalled by the selection on offer, Lane decided that good quality contemporary fiction should be made available at an attractive price and sold not just in traditional bookshops, but also in railway stations, tobacconists and chain stores.\"\n\nSir Allen, in speaking of Penguin Books, said: \"We believed in the existence in this country of a vast reading public and staked everything on it.\" Within the first year, they had sold three million paperbacks of then-contemporary authors, such as Agatha Christie, Ernest Hemingway, and Andre Maurois.\n\n\"Classic Books\" reading lists now in use at some universities have been in modern vogue since at least the early part of the 20th century, with the additional impetus in 1909 of the Harvard Classics publishing imprimatur having individual works chosen by outgoing Harvard University president Charles W. Eliot. The vogue for these \"Reading Lists\" has continued onto the 21st century, e.g., Jane Mallison's \"Book Smart: Your Essential Reading List for Becoming a Literary Genius in 365 Days\" (2007).\n\n"}
{"id": "79318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79318", "title": "Clotho", "text": "Clotho\n\nClotho (; ) is one of the Three Fates or Moirai who spin (Clotho), draw out (Lachesis) and cut (Atropos) the thread of Life in ancient Greek mythology. Her Roman equivalent is Nona. Clotho was responsible for spinning the thread of human life. She also made major decisions, such as when a person was born, thus in effect controlling people's lives. This power enabled her not only to choose who was born, but also to decide when gods or mortals were to be saved or put to death. For example, Clotho brought Pelops back to life when his father boiled and killed him.\n\nAs one of the three fates her impact on Greek mythology was significant. Clotho, along with her sisters and Hermes, was given credit for creating the alphabet for their people. Even though Clotho and her sisters were worshiped as goddesses, their representation of fate is more central to their role in mythology. Thread represented human life and her decisions represented the fate of all people in society.\n\nAccording to Hesiod's Theogony, Clotho and her sisters (Atropos and Lachesis) were the daughters of Erebus (Darkness) and Nyx (Night), though later in the same work (ll. 901-906) they are said to have been born of Zeus and Themis. Clotho is also mentioned in the tenth book of the Republic of Plato as the daughter of Necessity. In Roman mythology it was believed that she was daughter of Uranus and Gaia.\n\nAs one of the Three Fates, Clotho assisted Hermes in creating the alphabet, forced the goddess Aphrodite into making love with other gods, weakened the monster Typhon with poison fruit, persuaded Zeus to kill Asclepius with a bolt of lightning, and aided the gods in their war with the Giants by killing Agrius and Thoas with bronze clubs. Clotho also used her life-giving powers in the myth of Tantalus, the man who had slain and prepared his son Pelops for a dinner party with the gods. When the gods had found out what Tantalus had done, they put the remaining pieces of Pelops in a cauldron. Clotho brought him back to life, with the exception of his eaten shoulder, which was replaced by a chunk of ivory. Tantalus was then thrust into Hades for what he had done to his own kin. Clotho was worshiped in many places in Greece as one of the Three Fates and is sometimes associated with the Keres and Erinyes, which are other deity groups in Greek mythology. Ariadne, the Greek goddess of fertility, is similar to Clotho in that she carries a ball of thread, much like Clotho's spindle.\n\nClotho, along with her sisters, was tricked into becoming intoxicated by Alcestis. Alcestis, who had two children with Admetus, became extremely saddened when Admetus became very sick and eventually died. Alcestis used Clotho's drunkenness to try to get her husband back. The Three Fates explained that if they were to find a replacement for Admetus then he could be released from the Underworld. A substitute was not found so Alcestis offered herself up to be the replacement in order to bring her husband back to life. As the agreement had been met, Alcestis quickly began to grow sick and sank into her grave as Admetus came back to life. At the last instant, Heracles arrived at the home of Admetus. When Death came to take Alcestis away, Heracles wrestled him and forced him to return Alcestis, allowing Admetus and Alcestis to be reunited.\n\nAlthough there does not seem to be an epic tale in Greek mythology in which the Fates are the main focus, they have played critical roles in the lives of gods and mortals. A tale in which the Fates played an integral part was that of Meleagros and the Brand, which W. H. D. Rouse describes in \"Gods, Heroes and Men of Ancient Greece\". Meleagros led a hunting party to slay the Calydonian Boar, which was set loose upon Calydon by Artemis. She was displeased at the Calydonian king for neglecting to make a proper sacrifice to her. After slaying the boar, Meleagros presented the skin to a female member of the party, Atalanta, with whom he was smitten. His uncles were also part of the adventurous group, and they were upset by Meleagros' gift to Atalanta. They believed a female should not have the skin of the boar. As a result of this disagreement, Meleagros slew his uncles, who were his mother's brothers. She was so enraged that she decided to take vengeance upon him. She remembered a visit that the Fates had made a week after Meleagros was born. A Fate told Althaia that her son's life would expire when the burning log in the fireplace ceased to flame. She promptly extinguished the flames, preserved it and hid it safely. In her rage over the loss of her brothers, she lit the log to punish Meleagros. As the log was consumed in flame, Meleagros burned to death.\n\n\n\n"}

From 1788 until 1818 it was a patent theatre.\n\nThe actor Spranger Barry (1719–1777), born in Dublin and appearing in London from 1746, induced the London-born actor Henry Woodward (1714–1777), who had saved £6,000, to participate in his project to build a theatre in Dublin. Charles Macklin participated at an early stage, but soon withdrew. Barry and Woodward moved to Dublin, and the Crow Street Theatre opened in October 1758. It struggled as a rival to the Smock Alley Theatre. \n\nIn 1760 Barry and Woodward opened a theatre in Cork, the Theatre Royal. By 1762 Woodward had lost half his savings; the partnership was dissolved, and he returned to London. Barry continued for a few more years, then also returned to London.\n\nHenry Mossop, manager of Smock Alley Theatre since 1760, took over Crow Street Theatre in 1767, but resigned the theatre in 1770; the actor Thomas Ryder, who ran Smock Alley Theatre from 1772, also ran Crow Street Theatre. In 1782 the actor Richard Daly became owner of the theatre, and in 1786, having obtained a patent from the Crown, he opened Crow Street Theatre in 1788 as the Theatre Royal, a patent theatre. £12,000 had been spent on rebuilding and decoration. It was profitable for a while, but later suffered from the opening of Astley's Amphitheatre.\n\nFrederick Edward Jones leased the theatre from Daly, and spent £1200 on renovating the house, which was decorated by Marinari and Zaffarini. It was opened in 1796, but closed when martial law was declared, relating to the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Jones obtained a new royal patent in 1798, and spent a further £5000 on the theatre, but in the political climate it had to close in 1803.\n\nThe theatre was wrecked in a riot of 1814; and there were further riots in 1819. Jones attributed his unpopularity to his being active in politics; in 1807 he had supported the election of an anti-ministerial member of parliament for Dublin. His application in 1818 for renewal of the patent was refused, being granted instead to Henry Harris, a proprietor of Covent Garden Theatre. The years of disruption had been financially detrimental, and he was imprisoned for debt. During the 1819–20 season the Crow Street Theatre did not open regularly. \n\nThe theatre was rented for a short period and opened as a circus, and was then abandoned. In 1836 the Apothecaries' Hall Company bought part of the site, and a medical school was built.\n"}

{"id": "8249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8249", "title": "Definition of music", "text": "Definition of music\n\nA definition of music endeavors to give an accurate and concise explanation of music's basic attributes or essential nature and it involves a process of defining what is meant by the term \"music\". Many authorities have suggested definitions, but defining music turns out to be more difficult than might first be imagined and there is ongoing debate. A number of explanations start with the notion of music as \"organized sound\" but they also highlight that this is perhaps too broad a definition and cite examples of organized sound that are not defined as music, such as human speech, and sounds found in both natural and industrial environments . The problem of defining music is further complicated by the influence of culture in music cognition. \n\nThe \"Concise Oxford Dictionary\" defines music as \"the art of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion\" . However, the music genres known as noise music and musique concrète, for instance, challenge these ideas about what constitutes music's essential attributes by using sounds not widely considered as musical, like randomly produced electronic distortion, feedback, static, cacophony, and compositional processes using indeterminacy (; ).\n\nAn oft cited notable example of the dilemma in defining music is a work entitled \"4'33\"\" (1952) by the American composer John Cage (1912–1992). The written score has three movements and directs the performer(s) to appear on stage, indicate by gesture or other means when the piece begins, then make no sound and only mark sections and the end by gesture. What is heard are only whatever ambient sounds may occur in the room. Some argue this is not music because, for example, it contains no sounds that are conventionally considered \"musical\" and the composer and performer(s) exert no control over the organization of the sounds heard . Others argue it is music because the conventional definitions of musical sounds are unnecessarily and arbitrarily limited, and control over the organization of the sounds is achieved by the composer and performer(s) through their gestures that divide what is heard into specific sections and a comprehensible form .\n\nBecause of differing fundamental concepts of music, the languages of many cultures do not contain a word that can be accurately translated as \"music,\" as that word is generally understood by Western cultures . Inuit and most North American Indian languages do not have a general term for music. Among the Aztecs, the ancient Mexican theory of rhetorics, poetry, dance, and instrumental music used the Nahuatl term \"In xochitl-in kwikatl\" to refer to a complex mix of music and other poetic verbal and non-verbal elements, and reserve the word \"Kwikakayotl\" (or cuicacayotl) only for the sung expressions . In Africa there is no term for music in Tiv, Yoruba, Igbo, Efik, Birom, Hausa, Idoma, Eggon or Jarawa. Many other languages have terms which only partly cover what Western culture typically means by the term \"music\" (). The Mapuche of Argentina do not have a word for \"music\", but they do have words for instrumental versus improvised forms (\"kantun\"), European and non-Mapuche music (\"kantun winka\"), ceremonial songs (\"öl\"), and \"tayil\" .\n\nWhile some languages in West Africa have no term for music, some West African languages accept the general concepts of music (). \"Musiqi\" is the Persian word for the science and art of music, \"muzik\" being the sound and performance of music (), though some things European-influenced listeners would include, such as Quran chanting, are excluded.\n\nBen Watson points out that Ludwig van Beethoven's \"Grosse Fuge\" (1825) \"sounded like noise\" to his audience at the time. Indeed, Beethoven's publishers persuaded him to remove it from its original setting as the last movement of a string quartet. He did so, replacing it with a sparkling \"Allegro\". They subsequently published it separately . Musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez considers the difference between noise and music nebulous, explaining that \"The border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus ... By all accounts there is no \"single\" and \"intercultural\" universal concept defining what music might be\" .\n\nAn often-cited definition of music is that it is \"organized sound\", a term originally coined by modernist composer Edgard Varèse in reference to his own musical aesthetic. Varèse's concept of music as \"organized sound\" fits into his vision of \"sound as living matter\" and of \"musical space as open rather than bounded\" . He conceived the elements of his music in terms of \"sound-masses\", likening their organization to the natural phenomenon of crystallization . Varèse thought that \"to stubbornly conditioned ears, anything new in music has always been called noise\", and he posed the question, \"what is music but organized noises?\" .\n\nThe fifteenth edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" states that \"while there are no sounds that can be described as inherently unmusical, musicians in each culture have tended to restrict the range of sounds they will admit.\" A human organizing element is often felt to be implicit in music (sounds produced by non-human agents, such as waterfalls or birds, are often described as \"musical\", but perhaps less often as \"music\"). The composer R. Murray states that the sound of classical music \"has decays; it is granular; it has attacks; it fluctuates, swollen with impurities—and all this creates a musicality that comes before any 'cultural' musicality.\" However, in the view of semiologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez, \"just as music is whatever people choose to recognize as such, noise is whatever is recognized as disturbing, unpleasant, or both\" . (See \"music as social construct\" below.)\"\"'\n\nLevi R. Bryant defines music not as a language, but as a marked-based, problem-solving method such as mathematics .\n\nMost definitions of music include a reference to sound and a list of universals of music can be generated by stating the elements (or aspects) of sound: pitch, timbre, loudness, duration, spatial location and texture (). However, in terms more specifically relating to music: following Wittgenstein, cognitive psychologist Eleanor Rosch proposes that categories are not clean cut but that something may be more or less a member of a category . As such the search for musical universals would fail and would not provide one with a valid definition . This is primarily because other cultures have different understandings in relation to the sounds that English language writers refer to as music.\n\nMany people do, however, share a general idea of music. The Websters definition of music is a typical example: \"the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity\" (\"Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\", online edition).\n\nThis approach to the definition focuses not on the \"construction\" but on the \"experience\" of music. An extreme statement of the position has been articulated by the Italian composer Luciano Berio: “Music is everything that one listens to with the intention of listening to music” . This approach permits the boundary between music and noise to change over time as the conventions of musical interpretation evolve within a culture, to be different in different cultures at any given moment, and to vary from person to person according to their experience and proclivities. It is further consistent with the subjective reality that even what would commonly be considered music is experienced as nonmusic if the mind is concentrating on other matters and thus not perceiving the sound's \"essence\" \"as music\" .\n\nIn his 1983 book, \"Music as Heard\", which sets out from the phenomenological position of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, and Ricœur, Thomas Clifton defines music as \"an ordered arrangement of sounds and silences whose meaning is presentative rather than denotative. . . . This definition distinguishes music, as an end in itself, from compositional technique, and from sounds as purely physical objects.\" More precisely, \"music is the actualization of the possibility of any sound whatever to present to some human being a meaning which he experiences with his body—that is to say, with his mind, his feelings, his senses, his will, and his metabolism\" . It is therefore \"a certain reciprocal relation established between a person, his behavior, and a sounding object\" .\n\nClifton accordingly differentiates music from non-music on the basis of the human behavior involved, rather than on either the nature of compositional technique or of sounds as purely physical objects. Consequently, the distinction becomes a question of what is meant by musical behavior: \"a musically behaving person is one whose very being is absorbed in the significance of the sounds being experienced.\" However, \"It is not altogether accurate to say that this person is listening \"to\" the sounds. First, the person is doing more than listening: he is perceiving, interpreting, judging, and feeling. Second, the preposition 'to' puts too much stress on the sounds as such. Thus, the musically behaving person experiences musical significance by means of, or through, the sounds\" .\n\nIn this framework, Clifton finds that there are two things that separate music from non-music: (1) musical meaning is presentative, and (2) music and non-music are distinguished in the idea of personal involvement. \"It is the notion of personal involvement which lends significance to the word \"ordered\" in this definition of music\" . This is not to be understood, however, as a sanctification of extreme relativism, since \"it is precisely the 'subjective' aspect of experience which lured many writers earlier in this century down the path of sheer opinion-mongering. Later on this trend was reversed by a renewed interest in 'objective,' scientific, or otherwise non-introspective musical analysis. But we have good reason to believe that a musical experience is not a purely private thing, like seeing pink elephants, and that reporting about such an experience need not be subjective in the sense of it being a mere matter of opinion\" .\n\nClifton's task, then, is to describe musical experience and the objects of this experience which, together, are called \"phenomena,\" and the activity of describing phenomena is called \"phenomenology\" . It is important to stress that this definition of music says nothing about aesthetic standards. Music is not a fact or a thing in the world, but a meaning constituted by human beings. . . . To talk about such experience in a meaningful way demands several things. First, we have to be willing to let the composition speak to us, to let it reveal its own order and significance. . . . Second, we have to be willing to question our assumptions about the nature and role of musical materials. . . . Last, and perhaps most important, we have to be ready to admit that describing a meaningful experience is itself meaningful. \n\n\"Music, often an art/entertainment, is a total social fact whose definitions vary according to era and culture,\" according to Jean . It is often contrasted with noise. According to musicologist Jean-Jacques Nattiez: \"The border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus... By all accounts there is no \"single\" and \"intercultural\" universal concept defining what music might be\" . Given the above demonstration that \"there is no limit to the number or the genre of variables that might intervene in a definition of the musical,\" an organization of definitions and elements is necessary.\n\nNattiez (1990, 17) describes definitions according to a tripartite semiological scheme similar to the following:\nThere are three levels of description, the poietic, the neutral, and the esthesic:\n\nTable describing types of definitions of music :\nBecause of this range of definitions, the study of music comes in a wide variety of forms. There is the study of sound and vibration or acoustics, the cognitive study of music, the study of music theory and performance practice or music theory and ethnomusicology and the study of the reception and history of music, generally called musicology.\n\nComposer Iannis Xenakis in \"Towards a Metamusic\" (chapter 7 of \"Formalized Music\") defined music in the following way :\n\n\n\n"}

By the time of his graduation from the famous “Mukha” (\"Fly\" in Russian), he had already developed a critical stance towards the official Soviet art dominated by the Communist ideology and began exhibiting at semi-underground exhibitions. This was culminated by his taking part in a famous 1975 exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture. Abeshaus was fired from his job and censured by the official press – which however admitted his \"artistic taste, a good sense of color and form\". \n\nSoon afterwards, Abeshaus set up, together with several Jewish artists, the Alef Group and became its leader. The group’s first exhibition in November 1975 was held at Abeshauses’ small apartment. According to the Alef Manifesto written by Alec Rappoport, “We are trying to conquer the influence of small-town Jewish art and find sources for our work in deeper, wiser, and more spiritual European culture, and from it build a bridge to today and tomorrow\". \n\nIn May 1976, some of Abeshaus’s works, clandestinely sneaked out of the country, were exhibited at the Berkeley Art Museum to much critical acclaim.

{"id": "13073319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13073319", "title": "Feet of fines", "text": "Feet of fines\n\nA foot of fine (plural, feet of fines; Latin: pes finis; plural, pedes finium) is the archival copy of the agreement between two parties in an English lawsuit over land, most commonly the fictitious suit (in reality a conveyance) known as a fine of lands or final concord. The procedure was followed from \"c\".1195 until 1833, and the considerable body of resulting records is now held at The National Archives, Kew, London.\n\nIn the reign of Henry II of England, the royal justices first began the practice of registering the settlement of disagreements over land by having both parties bring a suit before the royal courts. The resulting decision was thus given \"royal sanction\".\n\nAt first, two copies of the agreement (\"fine\") were made, created as chirographs: i.e. the text was written in duplicate on a single piece of parchment, which was then cut in half, one copy going to each of the litigants. Under Hubert Walter's justiciarship, probably about 1195, the practice was started of writing the text in triplicate, so that a third copy could be filed in the Treasury. This copy of the text was written at the foot of the piece of parchment, and so became known as the \"foot of the fine\", or simply \"foot of fine\".\n\nThe first recorded foot of fine is endorsed with the statement \"This is the first chirograph that was made in the king's court in the form of three chirographs, according to the command of his lordship of Canterbury and other barons of the king, to the end that by this form a record can be made to be passed on to the treasurer to put in the treasury.\" The agreement concerns Walter's brother Theobald, who was the plaintiff.\n\nWithin a few years, the practice of recording feet of fines had spread widely, and even to Scotland, as in 1198 an agreement between William de Bruce of Annandale and Adam of Carlisle over eight ploughgates in Lockerbie, Scotland was filed with the English treasury, recorded with those from Northumberland. While early fines could be made in the Exchequer, after the early 14th century, fines were always made in the Court of Common Pleas.\n\nThe practice survived until fines were abolished by the Fines and Recoveries Act of 1833.\n\nMany feet of fines have been published by antiquarian, text publication and other societies.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48492758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48492758", "title": "Garrick Theatre (Stockport)", "text": "Garrick Theatre (Stockport)\n\nStockport Garrick Theatre was founded in 1901 and in 1904 obtained its own premises in Cobden Place, Wellington Street, Stockport, thereby becoming the oldest \"little theatre\" in the U.K. A \"little theatre\" is defined as being an amateur theatre that owns, leases or otherwise has control of its own premises.\n\nIn the summer and autumn of 1901 the drama group that was based at the Stockport Unitarian Sunday School on Petersgate was rehearsing a production of \"The Merchant of Venice\". The church organist who was also directing the production and who was a qualified engineer, Edwin T. Heys, decided that to avoid the tortuous trek through the church on the floor above the playing space to get from one wing to the other, the solution would be to dig a tunnel under the stage. This he and his headstrong colleagues proceeded to do until the excavations were discovered by the authorities and put a stop to. The incensed actors gathered at the Church Coffee Tavern opposite under the chairmanship of Heys on 24 October and formed themselves into an independent dramatic literary company which they decided to call the Garrick Society.\n\nIt was decided that the production in rehearsal would be the first play presented by the new society and a semi-professional director, Ryder Boys, was engaged to produce the work at the Mechanics Institute at the end of February and the beginning of March 1902. It played to great acclaim and was followed in the same year by Sheridan's \"The School for Scandal\" and then by \"Macbeth\" and \"The Rivals\". Some of the larger scale plays were performed at Stockports' Frank Matcham theatre, the Theatre Royal. The premises on Wellington Street were used for more intimate productions and ones which had not been licensed by the Lord Chamberlain such as Maeterlinck's \"Monna Vanna\" and several works by Ibsen and Shaw.\n\nDespite the calling up of many of the society's young men during the First World War, the society continued its work during the war years and seems to have escaped relatively unscathed, continuing to present between four and eight plays per season until peace came in November 1918.\n\nDuring the First World War a scheme for acquiring new larger premises was being mooted. This came to fruition in 1920 with the formation of a limited company, the chairman of which was Edwin Heys. The building which was acquired was on the corner of Exchange Street and Wellington Road South where the present theatre stands today. It was then an engineering works and contained various other enterprises including a Spiritualist Church. In 1925 funds were raised to raise the roof, which was until then supported on low beams and in 1935-6 new rooms were constructed above what was then called the Minor Hall and which is now the bar and studio theatre.\n\nAs well as continuing to present productions of the classics, especially Shakespeare, Ibsen and Shaw, the 1920s and '30s saw a flowering of home-grown talent in the presentation of works by Garrick members including Ross Hills, Channon Collinge, Percy Corry and Alfred Jepson. The Second World War seems to have been more traumatic for the society than the First, with many members who had joined the forces not returning and several of the founder members dying during the war years. However the seasons of plays continued throughout, boosted it would seem by an influx of members of Stockport Operatic Society who had ceased to function for the time being, enabling the Garrick to put on several Gilbert and Sullivans and a couple of other operas.\n\nAfter the war a general sense of exhaustion and depression seemed to have set in, relieved somewhat by the 50th-anniversary celebrations in 1951 and even more so by the extensive rebuilding and refurbishment work in 1962, necessitated and financed by the local council's compulsory purchase of a \"slice\" of the building to enable the widening of Exchange Street. The cantilevered extension over the Exchange Street pavement was constructed, the auditorium was raked, new seats installed, the windows closed off and open fireplaces removed. The name of the building, which had until then been known as the Garrick Hall, was changed to the Garrick Theatre as it has been known ever since.\n\nThe installation of a bar in 1973, despite strong opposition from certain die-hard members, further lifted the spirits as did another major reconstruction of the auditorium and the creation of further rooms at the rear in 1984; much of the preparatory work was carried out by members themselves. Most recently a major reconstruction of the bar area, providing facilities for it to double as a studio theatre, took place in 2010.\n\nFrom the outset the Garrick Theatre has often been adventurous in its choice of plays, with a particular love of Shakespeare which continues to this day (recently being involved with the RSC's Open Stages project), early productions of Ibsen, Shaw, Synge, Yeats, Hauptmann and Tagore gradually giving way in the middle years of the century to the more frivolous offerings of Noël Coward, Somerset Maugham, Alan Melville and the like. After the radical shift in theatrical tastes caused by the 1956 production of John Osborne's \"Look Back In Anger\" the Garrick gradually began to come up to date with productions of Osborne himself, Samuel Beckett, Arnold Wesker, Arthur Miller, David Hare and Simon Gray whilst continuing to lighten the mix with Alan Ayckbourn, popular West End hits and the occasional musical when the membership's talents lay in that direction. In the 1980s and '90s a number of amateur premieres were secured, including \"A Little Night Music\" (Sondheim & Wheeler), \"My Mother Said I Never Should\" (Charlotte Keatley), \"Corpse\" (Gerald Moon), \"Fools and Star-Spangled Girl\" (both by Neil Simon) and also from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s the theatre took several productions on tour to Buxton Opera House, the Isle of Man Festival, the Dundalk Festival in Eire, several venues in the U.S.A. and also two trips to Stockport's twin town in Germany, Heilbronn.\n\nSince the bar refurbishment the Garrick Studio has produced a wider variety of plays, presenting intimate, exciting and sometimes controversial plays by playwrights such as David Mamet, David Harrower, Jean-Paul Sartre, Yasmina Reza, Andrew Bovell, John Godber, Laura Wade, Dennis Kelly, Joe Penhall and Simon Stephens. It also enabled the theatre to encourage the development of new writing for the stage in Stockport. \n\nThe Youth Theatre has flourished in the past few years, presenting main stage productions and showcase performances each year. In recent years, Garrick Youth has grown from 1 weekly group of 20 students (aged 14-18) to 5 Weekly groups for around 100 students (aged 7-18). \n\nIn 2016 BBC Radio 4 recorded Mark Steel's in Town from the theatre. \n\nIn May 2018, Stockport Garrick hosted their first Stockport Festival of New Writing. A week long festival championing new writing for the stage. It included development performances by brand new plays by Stockport and Greater Manchester Playwrights and talks and workshops by theatre Makers.

Shantaram, and based on the novel, \"Na Patnari Goshta\" by Narayan Hari Apte, who also wrote film’s screenplay. The film was also released in Hindi as Duniya Na Mane (The Unexpected).\n\nThe movie went on to become both a critical and commercial success, and was shown at the Venice International Film Festival. The film is now hailed for \"its daring attack on the treatment of women in Indian society.\" and depiction of child marriage.\n\nFor film's lead actress, Shanta Apte, it was third most memorable performance in a row, after V.Shantaram's previous classics, \"Amrit Manthan\" (1934) and \"Amar Jyoti\" (1936). Besides other songs, she also sang a full-fledged English song in the film: \"A Psalm of Life\", written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807–1882).\n\nThe basic storyline revolves around a young woman, Nirmala (Shanta Apte) rebelling against her marriage to a much older widower, Kaka Saheb (Keshavrao Date), as was the practice in those days. The story is based on a novel by Shri. Narayan Hari Apte. It reminds us instinctively of the story of Sharada, a play by Deval which had long been a classic of Marathi theatre.\nNeera, a young girl, is married off to an old widower by her foster-parents, an uncle and his orthodox wife. The deal is obviously motivated by considerations of money. The shock of the marriage is too much for the girl, but she bravely tries to accommodate herself in the house. The widower deceives himself into believing that he is still not old enough to have lost his manhood. His college-going son tries to flirt with his young stepmother, while a widowed daughter of his sympathises with her in her woe. The marriage does not work. Some cheer is added to Neera's life through the company of a teenage girl belonging to the household. However, when the old man fully realises the implications of his action, he commits suicide, leaving the girl he has married against her will to go her own way.\n\nThe songs are from the lead actress Shanta Apte even sung. Shantaram Athavale wrote the lyrics to the music of Keshavrao Bhole. The English text of the song in the world's broad field of battle ... Be not like dumb, driven cattle is a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\n\n\nDespite the stresses of the film's melodramatic trains get Shantaram, his films always cut themselves, some outstanding visuals as the smiling face of the old man in the shards of broken mirror and the leitmotif of the ticking clock. Many of these images symbolize the impotence of the old man.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "478716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=478716", "title": "Lenaia", "text": "Lenaia\n\nThe Lenaia () was an annual Athenian festival with a dramatic competition. It was one of the lesser festivals of Athens and Ionia in ancient Greece. The Lenaia took place in Athens in the month of Gamelion, roughly corresponding to January. The festival was in honour of Dionysus Lenaios. \n\n\"Lenaia\" probably comes from \"\"lenos\" 'wine-press' or from \"lenai\"\", another name for the Maenads (the female worshippers of Dionysus).\n\nThe Lenaia is depicted on numerous vases, which show both typical Maenad scenes and those of aristocrats and wine-mixing rituals. It is unknown exactly what kind of worship occurred at the festival, but it may have been in honor of Dionysus as a youth or the rebirth of Dionysus after his murder by the Cyclopes. It may have also had some connection with the Eleusinian Mysteries, as some of the same religious officials were involved (such as the \"Archon basileus \" and the \"epimeletai\"). These officials led the procession (πομπή \"pompe\"), which probably ended with a sacrifice of some kind.\n\nIn Athens, the festival was originally held in the Lenaion (possibly a theatre outside the city or a section of the Agora) but probably moved to the Theatre of Dionysus by the mid-fifth century. Beginning in the second half of the 5th century BCE, plays were performed (as they were at the City Dionysia festival later in the year). The audiences for the Lenaia were usually limited to the local population, since travel by sea at that time of year was considered unsafe. Metics, however, were apparently allowed to both participate and act as \"choregoi\". Around 442 BCE, new comic contests were officially included in the Lenaia, though plays may have been performed there earlier on an informal basis. At first, the festival held dramatic competitions only for comedy, but in 432 BCE a tragic contest was introduced. Many of Aristophanes' plays were first performed there, such as 'Knights'. As with the competition at the City Dionysia, five comedies usually competed (except during the Peloponnesian War when only three were staged). When the contest for tragedy was introduced, two tragedians competed, each presenting two plays. No contests for satyr plays, nor for the singing and dancing of dithyrambs, were included. Towards the end of the century, the festival's plays were performed in the Theatre of Dionysus (though it is unclear when this location was first used). It is unknown when the Lenaia was abandoned, but contests of some sort continued into the 2nd century BCE.\n\n\n"}

Written while Auerbach was teaching in Istanbul, Turkey, where he fled after being ousted from his professorship in Romance Philology at the University of Marburg by the Nazis in 1935, it was first published in 1946 by A. Francke Verlag.\n\n\"Mimesis\" famously opens with a comparison between the way the world is represented in Homer’s \"Odyssey\" and the way it appears in the Bible. From these two seminal Western texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including even the Modernist novelists writing at the time Auerbach began his study.\n\n\"Mimesis\" gives an account of the way in which everyday life in its seriousness has been represented by many Western writers, from ancient Greek and Roman writers such as Petronius and Tacitus, early Christian writers such as Augustine, Medieval writers such as Chretien de Troyes, Dante, and Boccaccio, Renaissance writers such as Montaigne, Rabelais, Shakespeare and Cervantes, seventeenth-century writers such as Molière and Racine, Enlightenment writers such as Voltaire, nineteenth-century writers such as Stendhal, Balzac, Flaubert, and Zola, all the way up to twentieth-century writers such as Proust, and Woolf. Despite his treatment of the many major works, Auerbach apparently did not think he was comprehensive enough, and apologized in the original publication in 1946 explaining that he had access only to the 'insufficient' resources available in the library at Istanbul University where he worked; Auerbach did not know Turkish and so could not use locally available sources, and did not have access to non-Turkish secondary sources.\n\nThe mode of literary criticism in which \"Mimesis\" operates is often referred to among contemporary critics as historicism, since Auerbach largely regarded the way reality was represented in the literature of various periods to be intimately bound up with social and intellectual conventions of the time in which they were written. Auerbach considered himself a historical perspectivist in the German tradition (he mentioned Hegel in this respect) exploring specific features of style, grammar, syntax, and diction claims about much broader cultural and historical questions. Of \"Mimesis\", Auerbach wrote that his \"purpose is always to write history.\"\n\nHe is in the same German tradition of philology as Ernst Curtius, Leo Spitzer, and Karl Vossler, having a mastery of many languages and epochs and all-inclusive in its approach, incorporating just about any intellectual endeavor into the discipline of literary criticism.\n\nAuerbach was a Romance language specialist, which explains his admitted bias towards treating texts from French compared to other languages. Chaucer and Wordsworth are not mentioned even in passing, though Shakespeare and Virginia Woolf are given full chapters and Dickens and Henry Fielding make appearances.\n\nTo the consternation of his colleague, Ernst Curtius, Auerbach's work is marked by an openly anti-rhetorical position. Classical writers such as Homer, Tacitus and Petronius, as well as Medieval theologians (except St. Augustine), and writers of the seventeenth century, like Racine, are criticized for adherence to the rhetorical doctrine of \"styles\" with their corresponding subject matters: the low style's association with the comedic and the popular classes, and the elevated style's association with the tragic, the historic and the heroic. Auerbach sees the Bible as opposing this rhetorical doctrine in its serious and poignant portrayals of common folk and their encounter with the divine. As Auerbach notes in chapter two when discussing the New Testament:\n\nBut the spirit of rhetoric—a spirit which classified subjects in \"genera\" and invested every subject with a specific form of style as one garment becoming it in virtue of its nature [i.e. lower classes with the farcical low-style, upper classes with the tragic, the historic and the sublime elevated-style]—could not extend its dominion to them [the Bible writers] for the simple reason that their subject would not fit into any of the known genres. A scene like Peter's denial fits into no antique genre. It is too serious for comedy, too contemporary and everyday for tragedy, politically too insignificant for history—and the form which was given it is one of such immediacy that its like does not exist in the literature of antiquity.\n\nThe Bible will ultimately be responsible for the \"mixed style\" of Christian rhetoric, a style that is described by Auerbach in chapter seven as the \"antithetical fusion\" or \"merging\" of the high and low style. The model is Christ's Incarnation as both \"sublimitas\" and \"humilitas\". This mixture ultimately leads to a \"popular realism\" seen in the religious plays and sermons of the 12th Century. Auerbach also discusses the development of an intermediate or middle style due to Medieval influences from the Bible and Courtly Love (see chapters nine and fifteen on Boccaccio and Molière). This development of an intermediate and then ultimately another \"mixed style\" (Shakespeare, Hugo) leads to what Auerbach calls the \"modern realism\" of the nineteenth-century (see chapter nineteen on Flaubert). \nAuerbach champions writers during periods under the sway of rhetorical forms of writing like Gregory of Tours and St. Francis of Assisi, whose Latin was poor and whose rhetorical education was minimal, but who were still able to convey vivid expression and feeling. He also champions the diarist Saint-Simon who wrote about the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century French court. Completely free of the absolute constraints of style found in Racine or the superficial use of reality found in Prévost or Voltaire, Saint-Simon's portraits of court life are considered by Auerbach, somewhat surprisingly, to be the precursor of Proust (an admirer of Saint-Simon) and Zola.\n\n\"Mimesis\" is almost universally respected for its penetrating insights on the particular works it addresses but is frequently criticized for what is sometimes regarded as its lack of a single overarching claim. For this reason, individual chapters of the book are often read independently. Most critics praise his sprawling approach for its reveling in the complexities of each work and epoch without resorting to generalities and reductionism. \n\nBy far the most frequently reprinted chapter is chapter one, \"Odysseus' Scar\" in which Auerbach compares the scene in book 19 of Homer’s \"Odyssey\", when Odysseus finally returns home from his two decades of warring and journeying, to Genesis 22, the story of The Binding of Isaac. Highlighting the rhetorically determined simplicity of characters in the \"Odyssey\" (what he calls the \"external\") against what he regards as the psychological depth of the figures in the Old Testament, Auerbach suggests that the Old Testament gives a more powerful and historical impression than the \"Odyssey\", which he classifies as closer to \"legend\" in which all details are leisurely fleshed out and all actions occur in a simple present – indeed even flashbacks are narrated in the present tense.\n\nAuerbach summarizes his comparison of the texts as follows:\n\nThe two styles, in their opposition, represent basic types: on the one hand [\"The Odyssey\" 's] fully externalized description, uniform illustration, uninterrupted connection, free expression, all events in the foreground, displaying unmistakable meanings, few elements of historical development and of psychological perspective; on the other hand [in the Old Testament], certain parts brought into high relief, others left obscure, abruptness, suggestive influence of the unexpressed, \"background\" quality, multiplicity of meanings and the need for interpretation, universal-historical claims, development of the concept of the historically becoming, and preoccupation with the problematic.\n\nAuerbach concludes by arguing that the \"full development\" of these two styles, the rhetorical tradition with its constraints on representing reality and the Biblical or \"realist\" tradition with its engagement of everyday experience, exercised a \"determining influence upon the representation of reality in European literature.\"\n\nIt is in the context of this comparison between the Biblical and the Homeric that Auerbach draws his famous conclusion that the Bible’s claim to truth is \"tyrannical,\" since \nWhat he [the writer of the Old Testament] produced then, was not primarily oriented towards \"realism\" (if he succeeded in being realistic, it was merely a means, not an end): it was oriented to truth.\n\nHowever, by the time Auerbach treats the work of Flaubert we have come full circle. Like the Biblical writers whose faith in the so-called \"tyrannical\" truth of God produces an authentic expression of reality, Flaubert's \"faith in the truth of language\" (ch. 18) likewise represents \"an entire human experience.\"\n\n\n"}

A Nuit Blanche will typically have museums, private and public art galleries, and other cultural institutions open and free of charge, with the centre of the city itself being turned into a \"de facto\" art gallery, providing space for art installations, performances (music, film, dance, performance art), themed social gatherings, and other activities.\n\nIn 1989, the Helsinki Festival established its Night of the Arts, \"when every gallery, museum and bookshop is open until midnight or later and the whole city becomes one giant performance and carnival venue\". A year later, the mayor of Nantes, Jean-Marc Ayrault's program included renovating the central city and establishing a \"contemporary patrimony\", which led arts programmer Jean Blaise to create a late-night cultural festival, \"Les Allumées\" (\"Things Alight\"). His concept was to have an arts festival in Nantes, from 6 pm to 6 am, over six years with artists from six cities.\n\nThey were as follows:\n\nIn 1993, a year and a half after the St. Petersburg edition of Les Allumées, the annual White Nights Festival in that city began adding a specifically cultural component to a longstanding annual event that included street carnivals and the Scarlet Sails celebration. The expanded White Nights Festival has included pop culture (e.g. the Rolling Stones in the open air at Palace Square) in 2007 and high culture events (\"Stars of the White Nights Festival\" at the Mariinsky Theatre under Valery Gergiev) every year since 1993.\n\nIn 1997, the Long Night of Museums, took place in the newly re-united Berlin with a dozen participating schools and exhibitions; the number has risen to 125, with over 150,000 people taking part in the January 2005 night.\n\nIn 2001, when Bertrand Delanoë became Mayor of Paris, his deputy, Christophe Girard, invited Blaise to create an event there, and the Nuit Blanche was born. The concept of Les Allumées was scaled down to a single night and focused on the offerings of Paris. \"The first night-time trail through the streets of Paris and its contemporary-art scene took place on 5 October 2002, and the opportunity for anyone to explore artistic creation for a night has come back every year since.\"\n\nThe idea of a night-time festival of the arts has spread around the world, with events in over 120 cities, including Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary, Halifax, Winnipeg and Saskatoon in Canada, and several European capitals (Paris, Brussels, Rome, Madrid, Riga, Bucharest and Valletta) which have chosen to pool their efforts as \"Nuits Blanches Europe\". The cities share their experiences and exchange projects and artists.

{"id": "54224675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54224675", "title": "Nursing documentation", "text": "Nursing documentation\n\nNursing documentation is the record of nursing care that is planned and delivered to individual clients by qualified nurses or other caregivers under the direction of a qualified nurse. It contains information in accordance with the steps of the nursing process. Nursing documentation is the principal clinical information source to meet legal and professional requirements, and one of the most significant components in nursing care. Quality nursing documentation plays a vital role in the delivery of quality nursing care services through supporting better communication between different care team members to facilitate continuity of care and safety of the clients.\n\n\nThe internationally accepted nursing process consists of five steps: assessment, nursing problem/diagnosis, goal, intervention and evaluation. Nursing process model provides the theoretical framework for nursing documentation. A nurse can follow this model to assess the clinical situation of a client and record a constructive document for nursing communication.\n\nNursing documentation mainly consists of a client's background information or nursing history referred as admission form, numerous assessment forms, nursing care plan and progress notes. These documents record the client's data captured at the relevant stages of the nursing process. The following sections describe the concept, aim, possible structure and content of these nursing documents using the example of nursing documentation in Australian residential aged care homes.\n\nAn admission form is a fundamental record in nursing documentation. It documents a client's status, reasons why the client is being admitted, and the initial instructions for that client's care. The form is completed by a nurse when a client is admitted to a health care facility.\n\nThe admission form provides the basic information to establish foundations for further nursing assessment. It usually contains the general data about a client, such as name, gender, age, birth date, address, contact, identification information (ID) and some situational descriptions about marriage, work or other background information. Based on the different nursing care provider's requirements, this form may also record family history, past medical history, history of present illness, and allergies (see Figure 1).\nThe documentation of nursing assessment is the recording of the process about how a judgment was made and its related factors, in addition to the result of the judgment. It makes the process of nursing assessment visible through what is presented in the documentation content.\n\nDuring nursing assessment, a nurse systematically collects, verifies, analyses and communicates a health care client's information to derive a nursing diagnosis and plan individualized nursing care for the client. Complete and accurate nursing assessment determines the accuracy of the other stages of the nursing process.\n\nThe nursing documents may contain a number of assessment forms. In an assessment form, a licensed Registered Nurse records the client's information, such as physiological, psychological, sociological, and spiritual status (see Figure 2). The accuracy and completeness of nursing assessment determine the accuracy of care planning in the nursing process.\nThe nursing care plan (NCP) is a clinical document recording the nursing process, which is a systematic method of planning and providing care to clients. It was originally developed in hospitals to guide nursing students or junior nurses in providing care to client; however, the format was task-oriented rather than nursing-process-based. Nowadays, the NCP is widely used in nursing in various clinical and educational settings as a tool to direct individualized nursing care for clients.\n\nThe nurses make nursing care plans based on the assessments they have completed previously with a client. There are many ways of structuring nursing care plans in correspondence with the different needs of nursing care in different nursing specialties. For example, a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home may be structured with several sections under each care domain such as pain, mobility, lifestyle, nutrition and continence. The information is recorded in free-text style, and various terms are used singly or in combination to name each of the four sections in the formats that are used by a facility during a particular period (Figure 3). \n\nA progress note is the record of nursing actions and observations in the nursing care process. It helps nurses to monitor and control the course of nursing care.\n\nGenerally, nurses record information with a common format. Nurses are likely to record details about a client's clinical status or achievements during the course of the nursing care.\n\nThe paper-based nursing documentation has been in place for decades. Client's data are recorded in paper documents. The information in these documents needs to be integrated for sense-making in a nursing decision.\n\nElectronic nursing documentation is an electronic format of nursing documentation an increasingly used by nurses. Electronic nursing documentation systems have been implemented in health care organizations to bring in the benefits of increasing access to more complete, accurate and up-to-date data and reducing redundancy, improving communication and care service delivery.\n\nElectronic nursing documentation systems are able to produce somewhat better quality data in comparison with paper-based systems, in certain respects depending on the characteristics of the systems and the practice of the various study settings. The common benefits of electronic documentation systems include the improvement of comprehensiveness in documenting the nursing process, the use of standardized language and the recording of specific items about particular client issues and relevance of the message. In addition, electronic systems can improve legibility, dating and signing in nursing records.\n\nFor the documentation of nursing assessment, the electronic systems significantly increased the quantity and comprehensiveness of documented assessment forms in each record. In regard to the NCP, the electronic standardized NCPs were graded with a higher total quality score than its paper-based counterpart. In addition, in comparison with the paper-based documentation systems, the electronic systems, due to their automatic functions, were able to improve the format, structure and process features of documentation quality such as legibility, signing, dating, crossing out error and space with a single line and resident identification on every page.\n\nPaper-based documentation has been found to be inferior in comparison with electronic documentation. This is caused by the inherent nature of paper being difficult to update, time-consuming in a recording. Thus, the records are often incomplete, illegible, repetitive and missing signatures.\n\nElectronic nursing documentation systems have the potential to improve the quality of documentation structure and format, process and content in comparison with paper-based documentation, as demonstrated in a comparative study of electronic and paper-based nursing admission forms. However, improvement in documentation quality is not necessarily to be brought about by the introduction of electronic nursing documentation system to replace paper-based documentation. For example, Wang et al. that although the electronic nursing assessment form contained more documented assessment forms, which covered a wider range of resident care needs, they did not perform better than the previous [null paper-based assessment forms according to] the quality criteria of [null completeness] and timeliness. Therefore, further work on the usage of the electronic documentation systems may focus on improving form design and usage. There is also a need for improvement in compliance with standards in order to better meet the clients' care needs.\n\nA study by the National Client Safety Agency (NPSA) found that poor standards of documentation were a contributory factor in the failure to detect clients who were clinically deteriorating. Nurses are responsible for maintaining accurate records of the care they provide and are accountable if information is incomplete and inaccurate. Thus, a quality standard is required for recording of nursing documentation.\n\nThe systematic review of nursing documentation audit studies in different settings identified the following relevant quality characteristics of nursing documentation:\n\n\nNorth American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) nursing diagnosis:\n\nNANDA International (formerly the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) is a professional organization of nurses standardized nursing terminology that was officially founded in 1982 and develops, researches, disseminates and refines the nomenclature, criteria, and taxonomy of nursing diagnoses.\n\nNursing intervention classification (NIC):\n\nThe Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) is a care classification system which describes the activities that nurses perform as a part of the planning phase of the nursing process associated with the creation of a nursing care plan.\n\nNursing outcome classification (NOC):\n\nThe Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) is a classification system which describes client outcomes sensitive to nursing intervention.\n\nThe Omaha System:\n\nThe Omaha System is a standardized health care terminology consisting of an assessment component (Problem Classification Scheme), a care plan/services component (Intervention Scheme), and an evaluation component (Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes).\n\nInternational Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP):\n\nThe International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) is a collaborative project under the auspices of the International Council of Nurses. The ICNP provides a structured and defined vocabulary as well as a classification for nursing and a framework into which existing vocabularies and classifications can be cross-mapped to enable comparison of nursing data.\n\nStructured documentation takes the form of pre-printed guidelines for specific aspects of care and can, therefore, focus nursing care upon diagnoses, treatment aims, client outcomes and evaluations of care. It can improve client care by replacing the practice of vague, narrative style entries by nurses with cohesive and accurate information determined by the format of the care plan.  The clarity of the recorded information also facilitates clinical auditing and evaluation of documentation practices through. Therefore, the introduction of structured documentation and care plans are seen as a means by which nurses can raise standards of record-keeping practice.\n"}

This is the most definitive version of the script for any one performance, and will contain details of all cues, with their precise timings with respect to the action on stage. This allows the prompt to direct lighting, sound, flying effects and scene changes during a show. The prompt book also often contains blocking notes, so that the prompt is always aware of the intended positions and movements of all the actors on stage at any given time.\n\nIn some professional and high-quality community theatre productions, the prompt is never used during a performance to instruct actors if they forget a line or movement, only during a rehearsal. If prompting is absolutely necessary, it is done very quietly by another actor on-stage.\n\nThe prompt is located on the stage, in the prompt corner or \"prompt side\".\n\nIn Elizabethan theatre the function of prompting was filled by the Book-Holder, who was also in charge of props and calls.\n\n"}

Quick pencil drawings and marker renderings are two of the most common traditional techniques, although nowadays Adobe Flash, Adobe Photoshop, Storyboard Pro, and other storyboard applications are often used. The digital camera is one of the latest techniques in creating storyboards. \n\nMost storyboard artists nowadays begin and finish their work on computers using software and digital pencils or a graphics tablet. Storyboard artists may use photos to create visuals where stock photos or photos taken specifically for the project are put together digitally to produce a photographic representation called a photovisual. \n\nFor motion pictures, some filmmakers, directors, and producers choose to use clip-art computer programs designed to create storyboards, or use a dedicated 3D storyboarding software, or a more multi-purpose 3D program which can also be used to create elements of the storyboards.\n\nStoryboard artists have different goals in different industries.\n\nIn advertising, the storyboard artist can be called upon to create a representation of what the finished TV commercial, or spot, will look like in order to persuade and engage the client to buy the concept being pitched. This can either be at the time the agency is trying to win the client's business or once the client has signed on with the agency. In either case, the important element is for the storyboards to visualize for the client what the agency's creative director or \"creatives\" are thinking will sell the client's product. A storyboard artist may also be asked to visually represent several versions of a campaign for print ads.\n\nIn live-action film, a storyboard artist is hired at the beginning of a project. When a storyboard artist is hired by a motion picture company, the artist must break down the scenes of the script into shots which can be filmed. This is done under the supervision of the film's director in order to ensure the director's vision from the start of the project. As the production proceeds, the storyboards are presented to the cinematographer who is then responsible for bringing that vision to the screen. \n\nFilm production companies may also hire a storyboard artist to create polished presentation-style storyboards (which might also include sound) which can be used by an executive producer to raise the money to create the film.\n\nIn animation, projects are often pitched on the basis of storyboards alone (that is, a screenplay may not be written until later), and storyboard artists continue to work throughout the production to develop particular sequences. After a sequence is edited the director and/or storyboard artist and team may need to rework the sequence as it becomes evident that changes need to be made for timing and story.\n"}

Sestero details the troubled development and production of the 2003 cult film \"The Room,\" his own struggles as a young actor, and his relationship with \"Room\" director Tommy Wiseau.\n\nIn December 2017, a film adaptation of the same name was released, directed and produced by and starring James Franco as Wiseau, with his brother and co-producer Dave Franco in the role of Sestero.\n\nSestero, an aspiring actor struggling with confidence, first encounters Wiseau in an acting class. Sestero is at first perplexed by Wiseau's over-the-top acting technique, his unusual physical appearance, his unidentifiable accent and his eccentric behavior, which includes a fascination with all things American and a refusal to discuss his past. At the same time, Sestero admires Wiseau's boldness and his genuine enthusiasm for both life and acting. The two form an odd but affectionate bond as Sestero begins to learn of the many contradictions of Wiseau's personality.\n\nAs Sestero slowly accrues more acting credits and makes other friends, Wiseau grows jealous and schemes to earn similar acknowledgement (such as earning a SAG card by producing and starring in a commercial for a company he himself owned), leading Sestero to become uncomfortable with their relationship. After viewing \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" for the first time, Sestero is struck by how similar Wiseau is to the title character and convinces him to see the film. However, instead of recognizing his own behavior, Wiseau is deeply impressed by the performance and becomes obsessed with creating a movie just as emotionally powerful. The result is the screenplay for \"The Room\", which includes a character, Mark, named after actor Matt Damon (whose name Wiseau had misheard).\n\nBacked by a seemingly endless, mysterious supply of money, Wiseau develops, produces, directs and stars in \"The Room\", despite having no knowledge of filmmaking. On-set relationships are a disaster: the story itself is nonsensical and full of plot threads that are never addressed or resolved (a matter complicated by Wiseau refusing to give anyone a full copy of the script); Wiseau's camera set-up requires two full crews to operate, actors and crew storm off the set, scripts are rewritten in the middle of scenes, sets are broken down only to be rebuilt and re-shot the following day, and at the last possible moment, Wiseau convinces Sestero to join the crew as one of the principal actors, in spite of the role already having been cast. By the end of shooting, the cast and crew, convinced that the film will never be seen, lose their enthusiasm, resulting in lackluster performances and technical blunders that are never corrected.\n\nSestero screens a rough cut of the film for his friends and family, who are enthralled by its bizarre ineptitude. Their reaction turns out to be prophetic when, eight months later, Wiseau secures a release for the film, beginning its cult reputation as \"the \"Citizen Kane\" of bad movies\". The book ends with Sestero's meditation on the power—and danger—of unconditional belief in one's dreams.\n\nA film adaptation of the same name, directed and co-produced by and starring James Franco as Wiseau and Dave Franco as Sestero, premiered at South by Southwest on March 12, 2017, and was released in the United States on December 1, 2017.\n\nIn May 2014, an audiobook version of \"The Disaster Artist\" was released by Tantor Audio, with Sestero reading the story. Sestero's impression of Wiseau in the audiobook has received praise from critics, including \"The Huffington Post\" and Publishers Weekly.\n\n\"The Disaster Artist\" audiobook was named a finalist for the 2015 Audie Awards for Best Humor Audiobook.\n\nIn March 2014, \"The Disaster Artist\" (Audiobook) won for \"Favorite Non-Fiction Book of 2013\" at Bookish.\n\nOn November 23, 2014, \"The Disaster Artist\" won for Best Non-Fiction at the National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The judges praised the book, stating \"\"The Disaster Artist\" is not only a hell of a good read, it will make a great film if ever adapted. It's equal parts \"Ed Wood\", \"American Hustle\" and demented \"Citizen Kane\"—with a dash of Monty Python thrown into the mix\".\n\nOn February 11, 2015, \"The Disaster Artist\" (Audiobook) was nominated for Best Humor Audiobook at the Audie Awards, and was narrated by author Greg Sestero. The awards ceremony was held May 28, 2015 in New York City.\n\nOn January 23, 2018 \"The Disaster Artist\" was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 90th Oscars.\n\n"}

It was created in 2009 by Giancarlo DiTrapano as an offshoot of the acclaimed NY Tyrant Magazine, also founded by DiTrapano, in 2006. \n\nTyrant Books was created to publish books worthy of acclaim but less suited to large publishing houses, often because they are incendiary or avant garde. Giancarlo DiTrapano is quoted in the Los Angeles Review of Books as saying, “It would have taken forever for me to do anything I wanted to do [working for a traditional publishing house], but I had a little money, so I started a press.” In 2006 he founded New York Tyrant Magazine, which published “writers the big houses refused to touch,” including Brian Evenson, Noy Holland, Michael Kimball, Gary Lutz, Rachel B. Glaser, Scott McClanahan, Sam Lipsyte, Padgett Powell, Breece D’J Pancake and Gordon Lish and more. The magazine had immediate success and generated a following for the Tyrant brand, which benefitted Tyrant Books when it formed. The magazine was put on hiatus until December 2016, when it was brought back as an online journal, with Jordan Castro as the editor. In recent years, New York Tyrant Magazine has published a diverse roster of writers, including Clancy Martin, John Haskell, Gordon Lish, Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Blake Butler, Lydia Davis, Tao Lin, Noah Cicero, Ariana Reines, and Sheila Heti. \n\nIn 2009, 500 copies of the novella “Baby Leg” by Brian Evenson were published, marking the beginning of the transition to book publishing for Tyrant. It was followed by Eugene Marten’s “Firework” (2010), which is scheduled for re-release in 2017, and Michael Kimball’s “Us” (2011).\n\nIn 2013 Tyrant Books partnered with Fat Possum Records. The publisher’s most successful book to date is “Preparation for the Next Life” by Atticus Lish, winner of the 2015 PEN/Faulkner Prize for fiction, which had sold 15,000 copies as of January 2015. The publications are distributed through Consortium Book Sales and Distribution.\n\nIn 2013 DiTrapano met Matthew Johnson, owner of Fat Possum Records, while interviewing him for Playboy. The profile of Johnson, who was recording the last of the Mississippi Hill Country musicians, did not happen, but Johnson and DiTrapano became friends. Johnson developed an interest in saving the publishing house, which was struggling financially. Johnson became 50% owner and took over the business aspects of Tyrant Books while DiTrapano was freed to exclusively find and develop manuscripts. DiTrapano quotes Johnson in the Wall Street Journal as saying, “You’re a great editor but a terrible businessman”, and he responded, “I know”.\n\nThe first book to be published after the merger was the wildly successful “Preparation for the Next Life” by Atticus Lish (2014). Lish is the son of Gordon Lish, well known author and editor. A book of drawings by Lish (“Life is with People”) was published by Tyrant Books in 2011, and after the merger with Fat Possum DiTrapano asked Lish if he had any fiction. He emailed DiTrapano the manuscript, which took five years to write, and accepted a $2000 advance. Initially only 3,500 paperback copies of “Preparation for the Next Life” were printed. When the success of the book became apparent, 10,000 more copies were ordered, and in the meantime were printed on demand from Amazon. As of January 2015, there were 33,500 copies in print. The success of the book, which won the PEN/Faulkner Prize for Fiction in 2015, has contributed greatly to the reputation of Tyrant Books, allowing operations to continue and attracting serious submissions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40142349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40142349", "title": "Tågerup Church", "text": "Tågerup Church\n\nTågerup Church is a Romanesque parish church located 4 km southeast of Rødby on the Danish island of Lolland. Dating from the beginning of the 13th century, its nave is richly decorated with early 16th-century frescos painted by the Brarup workshop.\n\nThe church was originally dedicated to Our Lady as documented in a letter of indulgence from 1470. An altar dedicated to the Virgin Mary attracted large numbers of pilgrims on the Feast of the Annunciation until 1636. Little is known about the church's early ownership apart from the fact that the Crown had clerical appointment rights before the Reformation. The church remained under the Crown until 1725 when it was transferred to Emmerence von Levetzau together with Aalholm and Bremersvold. It continued to be owned by Bremersvold until it gained independence in 1911.\n\nThe church consists of a Romanesque chancel and nave, a Gothic tower and a more recent porch, all built in red brick. The chancel has lesenes on the east corners and a sloping base. The east gable's lower wall is engraved with crosses and emblems. There is a Romanesque window at the centre of the gable while a stilted arch frieze with saw-toothed courses decorates the gable at the lower roof level. A round-arched door on the south side of the nave is also topped with an arched frieze. The door on the north side has been bricked in. Several round-arched windows have survived. In the Late-Gothic period, a six-sectioned vault was added to the chancel while two cross-vaults covered the nave. The tower, also a Late-Gothic addition, is the same width as the nave and has a pyramidal spire. Rather drastic repairs were carried out by Hans Jørgen Holm in 1891-93.\n\nThe altarpiece contains a painting of Christ walking on water by Anton Dorph in a large Gothic frame. The pulpit in the Renaissance style is from 1586. There is a chancel-arch cross from the first half of the 15th century and another from around 1500 with a finely carved figure of Christ. Near the entrance, the Romanesque marble font with sculpted faces around the bowl is from Gotland.\n\nThe church is noted for its frescos. Those in the vaults of the nave and the chancel were uncovered and restored by Jacob Kornerup in the 1880s. Further restoration work was completed by Egmost Otto Lind in 1943. The frescos in the chancel, the oldest, are from the mid-15th century. Christ is depicted sitting on three rainbows while Mary, kneeling and bare-breasted, calls him. John wears a camel hide. The symbols of the Evangelists surround the figure of Christ who is topped by a crown of thorns and a cross. The text reads \"VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS\" and \"ITE MALEDICTI IN\". The style is simpler than normal with Christ's wounds depicted merely as small blots. The south segment depicts Pilate with a bowl of water. To the west, there are scenes of the whipping and the crucifixion with the two other victims and other figures including Mary and Mary Magdelene with a jug of ointment. The caption reads \"Vere filius dei erat isle\". The north segment displays scenes of the entombing and the resurrection.\n\nThe frescos in the nave are from the early 16th century and are attributed to the Brarup workshop. In the first bay, there are scenes of the Creation with the sun and a comet while God stands with the moon in his hands. There are fish and a shrimp in the foreground as well as a mermaid. To the south, God is creating animals including a goose, a dove, a crane and deer. In the south segment, Adam and Eve are created. The text reads \"ADAM PRIMUS HOMO DAMPNAVIT SECULO POMO\". The west segment presents the Admonition and the Fall while in the centre an angel stands with a hand organ. The text reads \" HIC ADAM ET EVA DECELTI SUNT A DRACONE\". The Banishment in the north segment is accompanied by a text reading \"HIC EXPELLANTUR DE PARADISO AB ANGLO CUM FLIENTE GLADIO\". Adam, in everyday clothing, has an axe in his belt and is about the till the earth. Eve is sitting with her children, one with a top and a whip.\n\nThe frescos from the Brarup workshop are quite different in style from those of the Elmelunde Master. God is not stereotyped. Like those from Isenfjord, they have energy. Eve, when working, holds the spindle correctly. In the scenes of the Banishment, Adam and Eve take long strides in contrast to Elmelunde where they are passive and static. In the illustration of the Fall and the Banishment, there are scenes of the Inverted World: a man shears the tail of a horse while another puts horseshoes on a cat. Both are based on items from \"Proverbes et rimes\" from 1480. Similar images can be seen in the churches of Hyllested, Brarup and Hästveda.\n\nAn older fresco of the Pietà can be seen on the east wall behind the altar. Mary is sitting with her dead son on her lap. The depiction of expression of despair is outstanding among Danish frescos. In 2005, a number of other frescos were discovered on the east wall, possibly representing the faces of other figures associated with the crucifixion. The altarpiece has been repositioned on the north wall so that the east-wall frescos can be more easily seen.\n\nOn the outer wall of the porch there is a runestone from the Viking period with an inscription which, when translated, reads: \"Eysteinn's sons raised this stone in memory of Sperla, their brother, Ásbjǫrn Neb's seaman.\"\n\n\n"}
