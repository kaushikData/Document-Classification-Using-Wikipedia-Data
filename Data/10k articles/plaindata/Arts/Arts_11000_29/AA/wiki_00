{"id": "386881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=386881", "title": "Alfred Eisenstaedt", "text": "Alfred Eisenstaedt\n\nAlfred Eisenstaedt (December 6, 1898 – August 23, 1995) was a German-born American photographer and photojournalist. He began his career in pre-World War II Germany and after moving to the U.S. achieved prominence as a staff photographer for \"Life Magazine\", which featured more than 90 of his pictures on its covers with over 2,500 photo stories published.\n\nAmong his most famous cover photographs was \"V-J Day in Times Square\", taken during the V-J Day celebration in New York City, showing \"an exuberant American sailor kissing a nurse in a dancelike dip [that] summed up the euphoria many Americans felt as the war came to a close.\" Eisenstaedt was \"renowned for his ability to capture memorable images of important people in the news, including statesmen, movie stars and artists\" and for his candid photographs, taken with a small 35mm Leica camera and typically with only natural lighting.\n\nEisenstaedt was born in Dirschau (Tczew) in West Prussia, Imperial Germany in 1898. His family was Jewish and moved to Berlin in 1906. Eisenstaedt was fascinated by photography from his youth and began taking pictures at age 14 when he was given his first camera, an Eastman Kodak Folding Camera with roll film. He later served in the German Army's artillery during World War I and was wounded in 1918. While working as a belt and button salesman in the 1920s in Weimar Germany, Eisenstaedt began taking photographs as a freelancer for the Pacific and Atlantic Photos' Berlin office in 1928. The office was taken over by the Associated Press in 1931.\n\nEisenstaedt became a full-time photographer in 1929 when he was hired by the Associated Press office in Germany, and within a year he was described as a \"photographer extraordinaire.\" He also worked for \"Illustrierte Zeitung\", published by Ullstein Verlag, then the world's largest publishing house. Four years later he photographed the famous first meeting between Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini in Italy. Other notable early pictures by Eisenstaedt include his depiction of a waiter at the ice rink of the Grand Hotel in St. Moritz in 1932 and Joseph Goebbels at the League of Nations in Geneva in 1933. Although initially friendly, Goebbels scowled at Eisenstaedt when he took the photograph.\n\nIn 1935, Fascist Italy's impending invasion of Ethiopia led to a burst of international interest in Ethiopia. While working for \"Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung\", Alfred took over 3,500 photographs in Ethiopia, before emigrating to the United States, where he joined \"Life\" magazine, but returned in the following year to Ethiopia to continue his photography.\n\nEisenstaedt's family was Jewish. Oppression in Hitler's Nazi Germany caused them to emigrate to the U.S. They arrived in 1935 and settled in New York, where he subsequently became a naturalized citizen, and joined fellow Associated Press émigrés Leon Daniel and Celia Kutschuk in their PIX Publishing photo agency founded that year. The following year, 1936, \"Time\" founder Henry Luce bought \"Life\" magazine, and Eisenstaedt, already noted for his photography in Europe, was asked to join the new magazine as one of its original staff of four photographers, including Margaret Bourke-White and Robert Capa. He remained a staff photographer from 1936 to 1972, achieving notability for his photojournalism of news events and celebrities.\n\nAlong with entertainers and celebrities, he photographed politicians, philosophers, artists, industrialists, and authors during his career with \"Life\". By 1972 he had photographed nearly 2,500 stories and had more than 90 of his photos on the cover. With \"Life\"'s circulation of two million readers, Eisenstaedt's reputation increased substantially. According to one historian, \"his photographs have a power and a symbolic resonance that made him one of the best \"Life\" photographers.\" In subsequent years, he also worked for \"Harper's Bazaar\", \"Vogue\", \"Town & Country\" and others.\n\nFrom his early years as professional photographer he became an enthusiast for small 35 mm film cameras, especially the Leica camera. Unlike most news photographers at the time who relied on much larger and less portable 4\"×5\" press cameras with flash attachments, Eisenstaedt preferred the smaller hand-held Leica, which gave him greater speed and more flexibility when shooting news events or capturing candids of people in action. His photos were also notable as a result of his typical use of natural light as opposed to relying of flash lighting. In 1944, \"Life\" described him as the \"dean of today's miniature-camera experts.\"\n\nAt the time, this style of photojournalism, with a smaller camera with its ability to use available light, was then in its infancy. It also helped Eisenstaedt create a more relaxed atmosphere when shooting famous people where he was able to capture more natural poses and expressions: \"They don't take me too seriously with my little camera,\" he stated. \"I don't come as a photographer. I come as a friend.\" It was a style he learned from his 35 years in Europe, where he preferred shooting informal, unposed portraits, along with extended picture stories. As a result, \"Life\" began using more such photo stories, with the magazine becoming a recognized source of such photojournalism of the world's luminaries. Of \"Life's\" photographers, Eisenstaedt was most noted for his \"human interest\" photos and less the hard news images used by most news publications.\n\nHis success at establishing a relaxed setting for his subjects was not without difficulties, however, when he needed to capture the feeling he wanted. Anthony Eden, resistant to being photographed, called Eisenstaedt \"the gentle executioner.\" Similarly, Winston Churchill told him where to place the camera to get a good picture, and during a photo shoot of Ernest Hemingway in his boat, Hemingway, in a rage, tore his own shirt to shreds and threatened to throw Eisenstaedt overboard.\n\nEisenstaedt, known as \"Eisie\" to his close friends, enjoyed his annual August vacations on the island of Martha's Vineyard for 50 years. During these summers, he would conduct photographic experiments, working with different lenses, filters, and prisms in natural light. Eisenstaedt was fond of Martha's Vineyard's photogenic lighthouses and was the focus of lighthouse fundraisers organized by Vineyard Environmental Research Institute (VERI).\n\nTwo years before his death, Eisenstaedt photographed President Bill Clinton with wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea. The session took place at the Granary Gallery in West Tisbury on Martha's Vineyard and was documented by a photograph published in \"People\" magazine on September 13, 1993.\n\nAfter first settling in New York City in 1935, Eisenstaedt lived in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York, for the rest of his life. Until shortly before his death, he would walk daily from his home to his \"Life\" office on the Avenue of the Americas and 51st Street.\n\nHe died in his bed at midnight at his beloved Menemsha Inn cottage known as the \"Pilot House\" at age 96 in the company of his sister-in-law, Lucille Kaye (LuLu), and friend, William E. Marks.\n\n Eisenstaedt's most famous photograph is of an American sailor grabbing and kissing a stranger—a young woman—on August 14, 1945 in Times Square. He took this photograph using a Leica IIIa. (The photograph is known under various names: \"V-J Day in Times Square, V-Day,\" and others.) Because Eisenstaedt was photographing rapidly changing events during the V-J Day celebrations, he stated that he did not get a chance to obtain names and details, which has encouraged a number of mutually incompatible claims to the identities of the subjects.\n\nThe portraits of Sophia Loren have been described as conveying mischievousness, dignity, and love on the part of both Eisenstaedt and Loren.\nThis 1932 photograph depicts a waiter at the ice rink of the Grand Hotel. \"I did one smashing picture\", Eisenstaedt wrote, \"of the skating headwaiter. To be sure the picture was sharp, I put a chair on the ice and asked the waiter to skate by it. I had a Miroflex camera and focused on the chair.\"\n\n\n\nSince 1998, the Alfred Eisenstaedt Awards for Magazine Photography have been administered by Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.\n\n\n"}

The Romans generally fortified cities, rather than building stand-alone fortresses, but there are some fortified camps, such as the Saxon Shore forts like Porchester Castle in England. City walls were already significant in Etruscan architecture, and in the struggle for control of Italy under the early Republic many more were built, using different techniques. These included tightly-fitting massive irregular polygonal blocks, shaped to fit exactly in a way reminiscent of later Inca work. The Romans called a simple rampart wall an agger; at this date great height was not necessary. The Servian Wall around Rome was an ambitious project of the early 4th century BC. The wall was up to 10 metres (32.8 ft) in height in places, 3.6 metres (12 ft) wide at its base, 11 km (7 mi) long, and is believed to have had 16 main gates, though many of these are mentioned only from writings, with no other known remains. Some of it had a \"fossa\" or ditch in front, and an agger behind, and it was enough to deter Hannibal. Later the Aurelian Wall replaced it, enclosing an expanded city, and using more sophisticated designs, with small forts at intervals.\n\nThe Romans walled major cities and towns in areas they saw as vulnerable, and parts of many walls remain incorporated in later defences, as at Córdoba (2nd century BC), Chester (earth and wood in the 70s AD, stone from c. 100), and York (from 70s AD). Strategic walls defending the frontiers of the Empire by running across open country were far rarer, and Hadrian's Wall (from 122) and the Antonine Wall (from 142, abandoned only 8 years after completion) are the most significant examples, both on the Pictish frontier. Most defences of the borders of the Roman Empire relied on systems of forts and roads without attempting a continuous barrier.\n\nNotable walls built by ancient Rome include, in chronological order of construction:\n\n\n\n"}

It comprised an exhibition, a publication and a lecture series that all focused on the heart and brain in various fields: art, science, religion, the occult and cooking, in order to reflect on the philosophical and practical relationship between art and science. The project was initiated by artist Per Huttner, at that time a student at the Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm and M.D. Ph.D. student Elias Arnér.\n\nIn the exhibition, one could see two large metal and glass sculptures of the heart and the brain that contained the crumbled posters promoting the exhibition. Large photographs of histological samples of the two organs sat next to scientific abstracts, occult and religious images. Close to the entry of the exhibition, hearts and brains of various animals including and elephant and a lemur which had been lent by the Museum of Natural History sat next to recipes of how to cook the organs. The lectures were held by Professor Lennart Wetterberg on the subject of how Swedenborg looked at the brain, Professor Erna Möller and the artist Lenke Rothman dialogued about creativity in their respective fields; Professor Rolf Luft examined social and cultural implications among Nobel Laureates in the sciences and Lars Olson talked about how a medial scientist sees the brain. Each lecturer also contributed with a text in the publication. In 2007, after Hüttner had developed some of the experiences from Begrepp – En Samling in projects like I am a Curator”, \"Democracy and Desire\" and formed the international research network Vision Forum, Huttner and Arnér decided to set up a continuation of their project, entitled (In)Visible Dialogues, which was shown publicly in the same venue in 2011, almost 20 years after the first exhibition.\n\n"}
{"id": "2518639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2518639", "title": "Contemporary French literature", "text": "Contemporary French literature\n\nThis article is about French literature from the year 2000 to the present day.\n\nThe economic, political and social crises of contemporary France -terrorism, violence, immigration, unemployment, racism, etc.—and (for some) the notion that France has lost its sense of identity and international prestige—through the rise of American hegemony, the growth of Europe and of global capitalism ()—have created what some critics (like Nancy Huston) have seen as a new form of detached nihilism, reminiscent of the 50s and 60s (Beckett, Cioran). The best known of these authors is Michel Houellebecq, whose \"Atomised\" () was a major international phenomenon. These tendencies have also come under attack. In one of her essays, Nancy Huston criticises Houellebecq for his nihilism; she also makes an acerbic censure of his novels in her work \"The teachers of despair\" ().\n\nAlthough the contemporary social and political context can be felt in recent works, overall, French literature written in past decades has been disengaged from explicit political discussion (unlike the authors of the 1930s–1940s or the generation of 1968) and has focused on the intimate and the anecdotal. It has tended to no longer see itself as a means of criticism or world transformation, with some notable exceptions (such as Michel Houellebecq or Maurice Dantec).\n\nOther contemporary writers during the last decade have consciously used the process of \"autofiction\" (similar to the notion of \"faction\") to renew the novel (Christine Angot for example). \"Autofiction\" is a term invented by Serge Doubrovsky in 1977. It is a new sort of romanticised autobiography that resembles the writing of the romantics of the nineteenth century. A few other authors may be perceived as vaguely belonging to this group: Alice Ferney, Annie Ernaux, Olivia Rosenthal, Anne Wiazemsky, and Vassilis Alexakis. In a related vein, Catherine Millet's 2002 memoir \"The Sexual Life of Catherine M.\" gained much press for its frank exploration of the author's sexual experiences.\n\nContemporary French authors include: Jonathan Littell, David Foenkinos, Jean-Michel Espitallier, Christophe Tarkos, Olivier Cadiot, Chloé Delaume, Patrick Bouvet, Charles Pennequin, Nathalie Quintane, Frédéric-Yves Jeannet, Nina Bouraoui, Hubries le Dieu, Arno Bertina, Edouard Levé, Bruno Guiblet, Christophe Fiat, and Tristan Garcia.\n\nMany of the most lauded works in French over the last decades have been written by individuals from former French colonies or overseas possessions. This Francophone literature includes the novels of Ahmadou Kourouma (Côte d'Ivoire), Tahar ben Jelloun (Morocco), Patrick Chamoiseau (Martinique), Amin Maalouf (Lebanon), Mehdi Belhaj Kacem (Tunisia) and Assia Djebar (Algeria).\n\nFrance has a number of important literary awards Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française, Prix Décembre, Prix Femina, Prix Flore, Prix Goncourt, Prix Interallié, Prix Médicis, and Prix Renaudot. In 2011 a new, controversial, award was created called Prix des prix littéraires (\"Prize of Literary Prizes\") which picks its winner from among the winners of these prizes.\n\nThe term extrême contemporain is a French expression used to indicate French literary production published in France in the last 10 years. The \"extrême contemporain\" is, then, an ever-shifting concept.\n\nThis term was used for the first time by French writer Michel Chaillou in 1989. This simple and convenient definition hides a complex and chaotic literary situation, both from the chronological point of view (the temporal boundaries of the \"extrême contemporain\" are in continuous shifting) and for the hetereogeneity of present French literary production, which cannot be defined in a clear and homogeneous way. The term \"extrême contemporain\", therefore, is all-inclusive. The literary production of this period is characterized by a transitory quality; because of the manifolded nature of such an immense corpus of texts, the identification of specific tendencies is inevitably partial and precarious.\n\nTherefore, to define the \"extrême contemporain\" as a literary movement would be very improper: it is a mere term of convenience used by commentators and not by the authors themselves.\n\nThe \"extrême contemporain\" can be seen as a \"literary constellation\" hardly organized in schemes. In some cases, authors of the \"extrême contemporain\" follow an \"aesthetics of fragments\": their narration is broken into pieces or they show, like Pascal Quignard, for instance, a preference for short sentences. The \"apportionment\" of knowledge can also be carried out by the use of a chaotic verbal stream, the interior monologue, tropisms, repetition and endophasy. The feeling of uncertainty experience by writers leads him to put in question the notion of novel and its very form, preferring the more general notion of \"récit\". Then, a return to reality takes place: in Pierre Bergounioux's works, readers witness the cultural upsetting concerning generations which follow one another; François Bon describes the exclusion from social and industrial reality; many authors of crime stories, like Jean-Patrick Manchette and Didier Daeninckx, describe social and political reality, and so it does Maurice G. Dantec in his works halfway between spy stories and science fiction; on another side, Annie Ernaux's \"écriture plate\" (\"flat writing\") tries to demolish the distance between reality and its narration.\n\nSubjects are shown in a persistent state of crisis. However, a return to everyday life and trivial habits also takes place: the attention is focused to the \"outcasts of literature\", like, for instance, old people. This use of triviality and everyday life expresses itself in a new sort of \"minimalism\": from Pierre Michon's \"Small lives\" fictional biographies of unknown people, to Philippe Delerm's \"small pleasures\". The facets of this minimalism manifest themselves in many ways, through the triviality of the subject, through short forms, or through concise and bare phrases. On one hand, heroicized characters try to build up their own individual way against a senseless reality, so that emarginated or marginal people emerge through the building up of their own story; on the other hand, a \"negative minimalism\" takes place: characters stagnate in social and relational difficulties.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The convention compliments the previously established provisions of UNESCO including the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity of 2001. \"The Convention recognises the rights of Parties to take measures to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions, and impose obligations at both domestic and international levels on Parties.\" The Convention is available in six authoritative texts including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.\n\nAs of December 2016, the Convention has 146 parties, which includes 145 states and the European Union.\n\nThe Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is a precursor for seven UNESCO conventions which deal with the four core areas of creative diversity; cultural and natural heritage, movable cultural property, intangible cultural heritage and contemporary creativity. These seven UNESCO conventions include the Universal Copyright Convention (1952, followed by a revision in 1971), the Convention for the Protection and Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (1954/1999), the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (1970), the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972), the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage (2001), the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003),and the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005).\n\nThe Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions deals with specific articles in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, Articles 8 through 11. These articles clarify three issues. First, the relationship that identity has with cultural goods and services, which values and meaning should not be treated as economic goods. Second, the States have the responsibility for the protection and promotion for the \"diversity of cultural expressions and ensuring the free flow of ideas and works\". Third, there needs to be international co-operation.\n\nThe Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is a legally binding international agreement that ensures artists, cultural professionals, practitioners and citizens worldwide can create, produce, disseminate and enjoy a broad range of cultural goods, services and activities, including their own. Cultural expressions are conveyed by activities, goods and services, which results in an economic and cultural nature. Due to this dual sided nature, cultural expressions cannot be seen purely as objects of trade.\n\nThe Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions main objective is to strengthen creation, production, distribution/dissemination, access and enjoyment of cultural expressions transmitted by cultural activities, goods and services, with a strong focus on developing countries. The promotion of dialogue and creativity of cultural diversity is an necessary element in the goal to achieve peace and sustainable development. The Convention was adopted in response to \"growing pressure exerted on countries to waive their right to enforce cultural policies and to put all aspects of the cultural sector on the table when negotiating international trade agreements.\" \"The international community signalled the urgency to implement an international law that would recognize the distinctive nature of cultural goods, services and activities as vehicles of identity, values and meaning and that while cultural goods, services and activities have important economic value, they are not mere commodities or consumer goods that can only be regarded as objects of trade.\"\n\nThe Convention's main objective is to provide a legally binding international agreement that reaffirms the sovereign right of States to adopt cultural policies that support their cultural industries. The Convention does not want to control and restrict cultural expressions, but to promote and protect them. Recognizing that the diversity of cultural expressions is a \"rich asset for individuals and societies, the protection, promotion and maintenance of cultural diversity are an essential requirement for sustainable development for the benefit of present and future generations.\". The Convention also defines on cultural industry and interculturality\n\nSince the late 1980s, a growing number of countries were showing concern that \"the proliferation of trade agreements promoting absolute market liberalization dramatically increased the threat to cultural industries. Countries wishing to retain their right to enforce cultural policies risked being marginalized and unable to maintain their position.\"\n\n\nThe preliminary draft was drawn up over a series of two years, 2003–2005. The Director-General of UNESCO assigned fifteen experts to write a draft called the Convention on the Protection of the Diversity of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expressions. Meetings were held for suggested improvements and the draft eventually led to the adoption of the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions on 20 October 2005.\n\n\nAs of February 2018, 145 states and the European Union have ratified or acceded to the Convention.\n\nThe Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions contains the following:\n\nAll cultural actors are required to participate as custodians to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. These include States and institutions recognised by the Convention, civil actors and civil society, private actors, such as cultural enterprises and industries, especially in developing nations and minorities and indigenous peoples.\n\nThe beneficiaries to the Convention are unlimited. The Convention benefits all peoples because the ability to participate and promote cultural diversity is profitable for all individuals and societies. Also, recognition for the creators of cultural expressions and the communities that celebrate their works. A major beneficiary to the Convention are the artists and practitioners of the cultural expressions.\nIn addition to the broad ranged beneficiaries, the Convention lists several specific groups such as women, indigenous peoples, minorities, and artists and practitioners of developing nations. Countries with the inability to produce and disseminate their own cultural expressions, such as developing nations. The Convention provides such need based nations financial assistance for the artists and practitioners of cultural expressions.\n\nTo become parties to the convention, member states of UNESCO must follow the traditional procedure; deposit and instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the Director-General of UNESCO. Invited non-member states, and regional economic integration organisations may also accede to the convention. The convention entered into force on 18 March 2007 after it had been ratified by 30 states. As of March 2016, the convention has been ratified by 140 states and by the European Union.\n\nThe main objective for the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions. The Convention highlights the fact that cultural creativity has been placed upon all of humanity and that aside from economical gains, creative diversity reaps plenty of cultural and social advantages. States must also promote \"openness to other cultures of the world\". Protective measures are also included in the Convention and international co-operation is encouraged in times of need. This Convention works to strengthen economic growth and cultural acceptance.\n\nAdditional objectives are as follows:\n\n\nThe Convention also affirms that \"Cultural diversity can be protected and promoted only if human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression, information and communication, as well as the ability of individuals to choose cultural expresions, are guaranteed.\" in a manner against a cultural relativism that may undermine universality of human rights.\n\nOperational Guidelines for the Convention: A series of operational guidelines were approved by the Conference of Parties at its second (15–16 June 2009) and third session (14–15 June 2011) in Paris, France.\n\nRules of Procedure of the Conference of Parties to the 2005 Convention: Adopted by the Conference of Parties to the Convention at its first(18–20 June 2007) and second sessions (15–16 June 2009) in Paris, France.\n\nRules of Procedure of the Intergovernmental Committees for the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions: Adopted but the Intergovernmental Committees for the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions at its first session in Ottawa, Canada (10–13 December 2007) and approved by the Conference of Parties to the 2005 Convention at its second session in Paris, France (15–16 June 2009).\n\nFinancial Regulations for the Special Account for the International Fund for Cultural Diversity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11075424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11075424", "title": "Creation of the World (Raphael)", "text": "Creation of the World (Raphael)\n\nCreation of the World is a mosaic composition in the dome of the Chigi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome, designed by Raphael. The chapel itself was designed by Raphael for his friend and patron, banker Agostino Chigi as a private chapel and family burial place. The dome was decorated with mosaics, a somewhat unusual and old-fashioned technique in the 16th century. Raphael's cartoons were executed by a Venetian craftsman, Luigi da Pace in 1516. The original cartoons were lost but some preparatory drawings, that confirm the originality of the work, survived in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. There are two studies for the figure of God and one for the angel above Jupiter. Another drawing in the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille shows the planet Mars with an angel. This is probably a creative drawing by a pupil suggested by its inferior quality. Luigi da Pace signed and dated the work at the corner of the panel of Venus:\n\n\"LV[dovicus] D[e] P[ace] V[enetus] F[ecit] 1516\"\n\nThe central roundel represents God, the Father, surrounded by putti, effectively foreshortened in an impetuous gesture, harking back to Michelangelo, which seems to give rise to the entire motion of the universe below. Eight mosaic panels show the Sun, the Moon, the starry sky and the six known planets as pagan deities depicted in half-length, each accompanied by an angel with colourful feathered wings. The figures are accompanied by the signs of the zodiac.\n\nThe sequence of the panels is as follows: the sky; Mercury, the god holding the caduceus (with Virgo and Gemini); Luna, the crescent moon jewelled goddess holding a bow (with Cancer); Saturn, the bearded god holding the scythe (with Aquarius and Capricorn); Jupiter, the king of the gods with his eagle holding a thunderbolt (with Sagittarius and Pisces); Mars, the god of war holding a sword and a shield (with Scorpio and Aries); Sol, the sun-jewelled god holding a bow (with Leo); Venus, the goddess of love with Cupid holding a torch as the Evening Star (with Taurus and Libra). A French engraver, Nicolas Dorigny created a series of plates depicting the mosaics in 1695 for Louis, Duke of Burgundy.\n\nThe mosaic panels are surrounded by richly gilded stucco decoration. The blue background creates an optical illusion giving the impression of an architectural framework opening to the sky above the chapel. The panels look like illusionistic skylights between the gilt stucco ribs while God is standing on the edge of the central oculus.\n\nThe traditional interpretation of the dome is that the composition shows the \"Creation of the World\". Another (disputed) interpretation claims that it represents the cosmos as described by Plato in a Christianized Neoplatonist form. This idea had a widespread popularity in the Renaissance. In this case the dome is a depiction of the Realm of the Soul after Death with God, the Father receiving the soul (of Agostino Chigi) in his new home. The presence of the signs of the zodiac corroborates this interpretation because the signs were symbols of the passage of time in eternity, and they appeared in antique funeral art around the image of the departed.\n\nNicole Riegel emphasized the role of the angels in the composition: \"In view of the important, anything but accessory position of the angels in the panels, there is an unmistakable effort for a reconciliation or interfusion of the Pagan and Christian life view.\"\n"}
{"id": "55487546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55487546", "title": "Creative peacebuilding (visual arts)", "text": "Creative peacebuilding (visual arts)\n\nIn the visual arts, creative peacebuilding offers a creative means to bring about peace within conflicted contexts. The use of the visual arts for effective peacebuilding emphasizes a consideration of the nature of the context where the tool is applied by not necessarily following a set format or paradigm. It reflects the potential to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships, or the like, to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, and interpretations geared towards establishing and sustaining peace.\n\nGenerally speaking, \"the arts\" refers to the theory and the physical expressions of creativity found in human societies and cultures. The major constituents of the arts include literature (poetry, novels, short stories, and epic poetry), performing arts (music, dance, and theatre), and the visual arts, the last of which includes creations that can be seen. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the term \"creative\" describes a quality of something created rather than imitated. In light of this, creative peacebuilding is a broad term for creative therapeutic strategies to create peace, within individuals, groups, and societies in conflict situations. Although used primarily to overcome violence, creative peacebuilding is also a preventative measure explored to establish stronger foundations of peaceful initiatives, especially when used with children.\n\nPeacebuilding is a process that facilitates the establishment of sustainable peace by preventing the recurrence of violence through different approaches which address the root causes and effects of conflict. Peacebuilding is an alternative to violence through reconciliation, and economic and social transformation.\n\nThe term \"peacebuilding\" has been widely used since 1992, when it was used by the former United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his \"An Agenda for Peace\". Boutros-Ghali described peacebuilding as \"action to identify and support structures, which will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a relapse into conflict.\"\n\nAccording to Johan Galtung, peacebuilding is the process of creating self-supporting structures that \"remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur.\" For John Paul Lederach, peacebuilding is a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships, which involves a wide range of activities. It has a diverse range of interaction and involves various stakeholders in various levels within the spectrum of governance and development.\n\nIf visual arts are artistic expressions that can be seen in their diversity rather than heard, then the relationship between visual arts and creative peacebuilding is reflected in the felt experience of creative peacebuilding in conflict situations. Visual arts are created to stimulate visual experiences. They are employed to help individuals cope with their feelings and treat post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nCreative peacebuilding through the visual arts is a process that facilitates the establishments of sustainable peace by preventing recurrence of violence, addresses the root causes, healing and effects of conflict, and offer alternatives to violence through reconciliation, economic and social transformation with the use of photography, film, painting, and the like. Jolyon Mitchell argues that the visual arts can both encourage peacebuilding and instigating violence. This is true of various forms of visual arts, ranging from posters, cartoons, and stained glass, to websites, radio, and films by reflecting on examples from around the world.\n\nPhotography is the science and art of creating durable images with light or other electromagnetic radiation, either through the use of an image sensor or chemical means of a light-sensitive. Susan Sontag opines that a photographer has the ability to create a reality by examining pictures. Photography is one of the forms of new media that changes perceptions and changes the structure of society. The objectivity and subjectivity of a photograph is sometimes problematic. Sontag argues, \"To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting one's self into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge, and therefore like power.\" Photographers decide what to photograph, what elements to exclude, and what angle to frame the photo, and these factors may reflect a particular socio-historical context.\n\nAlong these lines, it can be argued that photography is a subjective form of representation. The visual quality of photographic images is particularly effective in grabbing, maintaining, and retaining viewers' attention. It is commonly stated that a picture is worth a thousand words. In the context of creative peacebuilding, the visual qualities of photographic images provide specific benefits. The power of an image to establish an objective work is the sole judge of the message the viewer's read. Subjective truth makes it an effective tool for peacebuilding. Images span generations, languages, and cultural differences. Different people can easily engage with the characters or situations presented to them, regardless of their background. Pictures are both cognitively and emotionally compelling – a process that is essential to peacebuilding mechanism. The power of image is also condition by its design and purpose. Furthermore, photographic contents and images are employed to negotiate issues of the past in creative ways highlighting the incidents, experiences, emotions, and themes thus fostering alternative imagination of the future that will help to sustain peace.\n\nPhotography promotes freedom of participation, access, and engagement, which is within the control of the viewer, and also opens up process for peacebuilding. At their discretion and their pace, the viewer engages and reflects on their experiences, while seeing and dwelling in the experience of others. Such an experience often creates the need to revisit the picture.\n\nJolyon Mitchell has written about how websites have been used as a medium for promoting peace on the screen. Through the web, the world has become a global village. Therefore, websites can be created to facilitate peacebuilding. It offers a virtual location whereby individuals can login, get information, take action, and post and share issues to aid in peacebuilding.\n"}

It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nSet in \"Hope, New Britannia\", an overwrought nineteenth century New Zealand community seemingly on the edge of destruction, Dorothea Brooke (Ward-Lealand) is a shopkeeper and dress designer with a troubled past. She strives in vain to keep her feckless, opium-addicted sister Rose out of the clutches of her former lover, Fraser (Curtis). Dorothea is in a lesbian relationship with Anne Cooper (Chappell) but tempted by newcomer and former radical Lawrence Hayes (Smith). MP and war profiteer William Poyser (Hurst) wants her business and property to shore up his tottering career, through marriage. Dorothea, Anne and Lawrence become enmeshed in a tortured triangle, resolved when Lawrence agrees to marry Rose for convenience and to get her away from Fraser. Rose dies ravaged from her opium addiction, although Lawrence and Fraser have fought a battle on board a vessel as passengers and both are missing, presumed dead. Dorothea has been coerced into accepting Poyser in marriage.\n\nTwo years pass and Fraser returns, as does Lawrence. At an opera, a \"mise-en-abyme\" version of Fraser's sudden death is replayed – but the veiled female assailant turns out to be Anne, not Dorothea. Realising that Anne is her true love, Dorothea leaves Poyser to his fate, given the exposure of his financial mismanagement and gambling debts. Lawrence sees them off at the dock as they depart Hope, and Dorothea and Anne are last seen together at the vessel's helm, embracing and arm in arm.\n\n\nThe film was shot on a relatively modest budget of $2 million. As a money saving device it was mostly shot in a shed on the Auckland harbour. To further save on costs the cast members each played multiple roles. By utilising Fuji stock for its excessive colour the film was able to make the most of it costuming and art direction to create visuals that far exceeded what was to be expected from its budget.\n\n\"Desperate Remedies\" premiered at the Miami Film Festival to wide acclaim. It appeared at many festivals including Cannes Film Festival, Kiev International Film Festival and the Turin Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. The film picked up many awards including Best Design and Best Film at Kiev and the Audience Prize in Turin. It was also well received in New Zealand, winning awards for Best Cinematography, Best Design and Best Costume Design at the 1994 New Zealand Film and Television Awards.\n\nThe film also garnered critical acclaim in the US and United Kingdom with many high-profile publications giving it positive reviews. In the US \"The New York Times\" described the film as \"gorgeous but silly\" while the \"Los Angeles Times\" noted that \"Wells and Main never stumble, and their film emerges as a glittery triumph\". In the UK the film received glowing reviews from \"NME\" who described it as \"gloriously overblown, shamelessly camp and utterly wonderful\" while \"The Sunday Times\" reviewed it as \"Deliciously Dotty\".\n\n"}

The success of Louisiana's film industry caused the state to be nicknamed \"Hollywood South\" or \"Hollywood on the Bayou\". In 2013, by some measures, film and television production in Louisiana exceeded that of California for the first time.\n\nFilm-making in Louisiana began in 1898 with the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company. It has been the site of several notable productions over the years, the first of which was \"Tarzan of the Apes\", completed in 1918. Other earlier film productions include \"Jezebel\", \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", \"Easy Rider\", \"Live and Let Die\", and \"The Big Easy\".\n\nLouisiana has hosted a long list of major film and television stars over the years whose reputations and talents have likely played a role in the rise of state's film industry. Some of these actors and actresses include Bette Davis, Henry Fonda, Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Denzel Washington, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Julia Roberts, Dennis Hopper, Cicely Tyson, Elvis Presley, Dennis Quaid, John Goodman, Jessica Lange, Richard Pryor, Jackie Gleason, James Spader, Dolly Parton, Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Costner, Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Yul Brenner, David Niven, Jimmy Stewart, James Mason, Brad Pitt, Charles Bronson, and Daryl Hannah.\n\nIn 2002, Louisiana passed unique tax incentives aimed at recruiting film and television productions to the state. By 2011, the state's skilled crew base had grown by over 400 percent, and since 2006 over 300 films have been shot in Louisiana. The industry truly entered the national spotlight though when \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" earned thirteen Oscar nominations, the most in 2009.\n\nIn 2010, boosted by its film industry, Louisiana made its first appearance in Site Selection Magazine’s Top Business Climate rankings.\n\nIn 2011 Louisiana hosted more than 150 productions and about $1.3 billion of their combined $1.9 billion in budgets was spent in the state.\n\nOn July 1, 2002, the Louisiana Legislature enacted the Louisiana Motion Picture Tax Incentive Act. This tax credit has two primary components. First, the Investor Tax Credit provides a 30% tax credit on qualified motion picture expenditures with no project or program cap. Second, the Labor Tax Credit provides a 5% credit for payroll expenditures on Louisiana residents. This program not only encourages residents to film in Louisiana but also employ Louisiana residents. To qualify for this program, filmmakers must spend at least $300,000 in Louisiana.\n\nLouisiana's warm weather and diverse locations have appealed to film producers across the country considering that the subtropical climate makes filming possible year-round without interruptions. The spring and fall months are considered ideal filming time, with October being the driest month. In terms of scenery, Louisiana offers swamps and cypress trees, public and private college campuses, antebellum plantations, and urban environments. These diverse locations are often credited for Louisiana's ability to stand in as multiple settings such as Texas, Colorado, Utah, Washington, DC, and London. As Patrick Lussier, director of Drive Angry 3D, commented in USA Today, \"The film industry wants to find places it can reinvent and make look like anything it needs. There's a lot of opportunity [to] do that in Louisiana.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "284685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=284685", "title": "Gesamtkunstwerk", "text": "Gesamtkunstwerk\n\nA Gesamtkunstwerk (, translated as \"total work of art\", \"ideal work of art\", \"universal artwork\", \"synthesis of the arts\", \"comprehensive artwork\", \"all-embracing art form\" or \"total artwork\") is a work of art that makes use of all or many art forms or strives to do so. The term is a German word which has come to be accepted in English as a term in aesthetics.\n\nThe term was first used by the German writer and philosopher K. F. E. Trahndorff in an essay in 1827. The German opera composer Richard Wagner used the term in two 1849 essays, and the word has become particularly associated with his aesthetic ideals. It is unclear whether Wagner knew of Trahndorff's essay.\n\nIn the twentieth century, some writers applied the term to some forms of architecture, while others have applied it to film and mass media.\n\nSome elements of opera reform, seeking a more \"classical\" formula, had begun at the end of the 18th century. After the lengthy domination of opera seria, and the \"da capo aria\", a movement began to advance the librettist and the composer in relation to the singers, and to return the drama to a more intense and less moralistic focus. This movement, \"reform opera\" is primarily associated with Christoph Willibald Gluck and Ranieri de' Calzabigi. The themes in the operas produced by Gluck's collaborations with Calzabigi continue throughout the operas of Carl Maria von Weber, until Wagner, rejecting both the Italian \"bel canto\" tradition and the French \"spectacle opera\", developed his union of music, drama, theatrical effects, and occasionally dance.\n\nHowever these trends had developed fortuitously, rather than in response to a specific philosophy of art; Wagner, who recognised the reforms of Gluck and admired the works of Weber, wished to consolidate his view, originally, as part of his radical social and political views of the late 1840s. Previous to Wagner, others who had expressed ideas about union of the arts, which was a familiar topic among German Romantics, as evidenced by the title of Trahndorff's essay, in which the word first occurred, \"Aesthetics, or Theory of Philosophy of Art\". Others who wrote on syntheses of the arts included Gottfried Lessing, Ludwig Tieck and Novalis. Carl Maria von Weber's enthusiastic review of E.T.A. Hoffmann's opera \"Undine\" (1816) admired it as 'an art work complete in itself, in which partial contributions of the related and collaborating arts blend together, disappear, and, in disappearing, somehow form a new world'.\n\nWagner used the exact term 'Gesamtkunstwerk' (which he spelt 'Gesammtkunstwerk') on only two occasions, in his 1849 essays \"Art and Revolution\" and \"The Artwork of the Future\", where he speaks of his ideal of unifying all works of art via the theatre. He also used in these essays many similar expressions such as 'the consummate artwork of the future' and 'the integrated drama', and frequently referred to 'Gesamtkunst'. Such a work of art was to be the clearest and most profound expression of folk legend, though abstracted from its nationalist particulars to a universal humanist fable.\n\nWagner felt that the Greek tragedies of Aeschylus had been the finest (though still flawed) examples so far of total artistic synthesis, but that this synthesis had subsequently been corrupted by Euripides. Wagner felt that during the rest of human history up to the present day (i.e. 1850) the arts had drifted further and further apart, resulting in such \"monstrosities\" as Grand Opera. Wagner felt that such works celebrated bravura singing, sensational stage effects, and meaningless plots. In \"Art and Revolution\" Wagner applies the term 'Gesamtkunstwerk' in the context of Greek tragedy. In \"The Art-Work of the Future\" he uses it to apply to his own, as yet unrealised, ideal.\n\nIn his extensive book \"Opera and Drama\" (completed in 1851) he takes these ideas further, describing in detail his idea of the union of opera and drama (later called \"music drama\" despite Wagner's disapproval of the term), in which the individual arts are subordinated to a common purpose.\n\nWagner's own opera cycle \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", and specifically its components \"Das Rheingold\" and \"Die Walküre\" represent perhaps the closest he, or anyone else, came to realising these ideals; he was himself after this stage to relax his own strictures and write more 'operatically'.\n\nSome architectural writers have used the term \"Gesamtkunstwerk\" to signify circumstances where an architect is responsible for the design and/or overseeing of the building's totality: shell, accessories, furnishings, and landscape. It is difficult to make a claim for when the notion of the \"Gesamtkunstwerk\" was first employed from the point of view of a building and its contents (although the term itself was not used in this context until the late 20th century); already during the Renaissance, artists such as Michelangelo saw no strict division in their tasks between architecture, interior design, sculpture, painting and even engineering. \nIt has been argued by historian Robert L. Delevoy that Art Nouveau represented an essentially decorative trend that thus lent itself to the idea of the architectural \"Gesamtkunstwerk\". But it is equally possible it was born from social theories that arose out of a fear of the rise of industrialism.\nHowever evidence of complete interiors that typify the concept of \"Gesamtkunstwerk\" can be seen some time before the 1890s. There was an increasing trend amongst architects in the 18th and 19th centuries to control every facet of an architectural commission. As well as being responsible for the structure they tried to extend their role to include designing (or at least vetting) every aspect of the interior work as well. This included not only the interior architectural features but was extended to the design of furniture, carpets, wallpaper, fabrics, light fixtures and door-handles. Robert Adam and Augustus Welby Pugin are examples of this trend to create an over-all harmonising effect which in some cases might even extend to the choice or design of table silver, china and glassware.\nA distinctly modern approach to the concept of architectural \"Gesamtkunstwerk\" emerged with the Bauhaus school, first established in Weimar in 1919 by Walter Gropius. The school specialised in design, art and craftsmanship (architecture was not introduced as a separate course until 1927 after it had transferred to Dessau). Gropius contended that artists and architects should also be craftsmen, that they should have experience working with different materials and artistic mediums, including industrial design, clothes design and theatre and music. However, Gropius did not necessarily see a building and every aspect of its design as being the work of a single hand.\n\nCanadian development corporation Westbank, founded by Ian Gillespie, uses Gesamtkunstwerk as the founding idea behind the company's vision and philosophy for urban development.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "649575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=649575", "title": "Heteroglossia", "text": "Heteroglossia\n\nThe term heteroglossia describes the coexistence of distinct varieties within a single \"language\" (in Greek: \"hetero-\" \"different\" and \"glōssa\" \"tongue, language\"). In this way the term translates the Russian разноречие [\"raznorechie\"], which was introduced by the Russian linguist Mikhail Bakhtin in his 1934 paper \"Слово в романе\" [Slovo v romane], published in English as \"Discourse in the Novel.\"\n\nBakhtin argues that the power of the novel originates in the coexistence of, and conflict between, different types of speech: the speech of characters, the speech of narrators, and even the speech of the author. He defines heteroglossia as \"another's speech in another's language, serving to express authorial intentions but in a refracted way\"(1934). Bakhtin identifies the direct narrative of the author, rather than dialogue between characters, as the primary location of this conflict.\n\nBakhtin viewed the modern novel as a literary form best suited for the exploitation of heteroglossia, in direct contrast to epic poetry (and, in a lesser degree, poetry in general). The linguistic energy of the novel was seen in its expression of the conflict between voices through their description to different elements in the novel's discourse.\n\nAny language, in Bakhtin's view, stratifies into many voices: \"social dialects, characteristic group behaviour, professional jargons, generic languages, languages of generations and age groups, tendentious languages, languages of the authorities, of various circles and of passing fashions\". This diversity of voice is, Bakhtin asserts, the defining characteristic of the novel as a genre.\n\nTraditional stylistics, like epic poetry, do not share the trait of heteroglossia. In Bakhtin's words, \"poetry depersonalizes 'days' in language, while prose, as we shall see, often deliberately intensifies difference between them...\"\n\nExtending his argument, Bakhtin proposes that all languages represent a distinct point of view on the world, characterized by its own meaning and values. In this view, language is \"shot through with intentions and accents\" (1981: 324), and thus there are no neutral words. Even the most unremarkable statement possesses a taste, whether of a profession, a party, a generation, a place or a time. To Bakhtin, words do not exist until they are spoken, and that moment they are printed with the signature of the speaker.\n\nBakhtin identifies the act of speech, or of writing, as a literary-verbal performance, one that requires speakers or authors to take a position, even if only by choosing the dialect in which they will speak. Separate languages are often identified with separate circumstances. Bakhtin gives an example of an illiterate peasant, who speaks Church Slavonic to God, speaks to his family in their own peculiar dialect, sings songs in yet a third, and attempts to emulate officious high-class dialect when he dictates petitions to the local government. The prose writer, Bakhtin argues, must welcome and incorporate these many languages into his work.\n\nThe hybrid utterance, as defined by Bakhtin, is a passage that employs only a single speaker—the author, for example—but one or more kinds of speech. The juxtaposition of the two different speeches brings with it a contradiction and conflict in belief systems.\n\nIn examination of the English comic novel, particularly the works of Charles Dickens, Bakhtin identifies examples of his argument. Dickens parodies both the 'common tongue' and the language of Parliament or high-class banquets, using concealed languages to create humor. In one passage, Dickens shifts from his authorial narrative voice into a formalized, almost epic tone while describing the work of an unremarkable bureaucrat; his intent is to parody the self-importance and vainglory of the bureaucrat's position. The use of concealed speech, without formal markers of a speaker change, is what allows the parody to work. It is, in Bakhtin's parlance, a hybrid utterance. In this instance the conflict is between the factual narrative and the biting hyperbole of the new, epic/formalistic tone.\n\nBakhtin goes on to discuss the interconnectedness of conversation. Even a simple dialogue, in his view, is full of quotations and references, often to a general \"everyone says\" or \"I heard that..\" Opinion and information are transmitted by way of reference to an indefinite, general source. By way of these references, humans selectively assimilate the discourse of others and make it their own.\n\nBakhtin identifies a specific type of discourse, the \"authoritative discourse,\" which demands to be assimilated by the reader or listener; examples might be religious dogma, or scientific theory, or a popular book. This type of discourse is viewed as past, finished, hierarchically superior, and therefore demands \"unconditional allegiance\" rather than accepting interpretation. Because of this, Bakhtin states that authoritative discourse plays an insignificant role in the novel. Because it is not open to interpretation, it cannot enter into hybrid utterance.\n\nBakhtin concludes by arguing that the role of the novel is to draw the authoritative into question, and to allow what was once considered certain to be debated and open to interpretation. In effect, novels not only function through heteroglossia, but must promote it; to do otherwise is an artistic failure.\n\nBakhtin's view of heteroglossia has been often employed in the context of the postmodern critique of the perceived teleological and authoritarian character of modernist art and culture. In particular, the latter's strong disdain for popular forms of art and literature—archetypically expressed in Adorno and Horkheimer's analysis of the culture industry—has been criticised as a proponent of \"monoglossia\"; practitioners of cultural studies have used Bakhtin's conceptual framework to theorise the critical reappropriation of mass-produced entertainment forms by the public.\n\n\n"}

However, Jewish paper cuts can be traced to Jewish communities in Syria, Iraq, and North Africa, and the similarity in the cutting techniques (using a knife) between East European Jews and Chinese paper cutters, may indicate that the origin goes back even further. Some contend that Ashkenazi paper-cutting may date to the 14th century, though its popularity reached a zenith in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe first mention of Jewish paper cutting can be found in the treatise \"The fight of the pen and the scissors” by a 14th-century rabbi, Shem Tov ben Isaac ben Ardutiel (1290-1369), who describes how he decided to cut letters in paper when his ink became frozen during a harsh winter. To students of Christian Spanish literary history, Rabbi Shem Tov is known as Santob de Carrion de los Condes, the courtly Castilian troubadour who composed the Proverbios morales for Pedro the Cruel. Paper cutting as a folk craft gained popularity in the nineteenth century when paper became a cheap material.\n\nPaper cutting was widespread among the Jews of Poland and Russia in the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century. Jewish paper cuts were also produced in Germany and probably in the Netherlands. Some Italian Jewish parchment ketubot (marriage contracts) from the late 17th century until the nineteenth century were decorated paper cuts as well as some elaborate scrolls of the Book of Esther. Similar paper cuttings from Jewish communities North Africa and the Middle East have some characteristic style differences.\n\nIt was popular among Jews both in eastern and western Europe as well as in Turkey, Morocco, Syria, Bangladesh, Israel, and North America.\n\nIn North Africa and the Middle East paper cuts were called a \"Menorah\", because one or more menorah, always appeared as the central motif. These paper cuts included many inscriptions, mostly on the arms of the candelabras. The paper was mounted on thin, colored metal sheets. Two distinct kinds were produced: a Mizrah and smaller paper cuts used as charms. The motifs are the same as in European Jewish paper cuts but they have a distinctive Eastern style. Also, the hamsa (\"the five-finger hand\"), unknown in Europe, very often appears on these paper cuts.\n\nJewish paper cutting began disappearing in the first half of the twentieth century, mainly because of the rapid assimilation trends and the waning of many traditional practices, and was practiced only by older people who remembered this art form from their youth. Many paper cuts collections that had been preserved were destroyed during World War II and the Holocaust and relatively few remain in public or private collections.\n\nSince the late twentieth century, Jewish paper cuts have again become a popular art form in both Israel and other countries. Paper cutting is again often used to decorate ketubot, wedding invitations, and works of art. To a limited extent, Jewish paper cuts have become more popular in Poland as a result of the Jewish Culture Festival in Kraków, a festival that has been held in Kraków since the 1990s.\n\nBeit Hatefutsot – The Museum of the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, Israel presented a 2009 exhibition called \"The Revival of Jewish Papercuts: Jewish paper cut art\" in October 2009. The exhibit was curated by Prof. Olga Goldberg, Gabriella Rabbi, Rina Biran, the Giza Frenkel Papercut Archive, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Additionally, a National Science Foundation-funded study called “Tradition and Continuity in Jewish Papercuts” was conducted by Prof. Olga Goldberg.\n\nArtist Oren Loloi writes that the art of Jewish papercutting's resurgence is due in large part to the efforts of Polish-Jewish anthropologist and ethnologist Giza Frankel (see below). Frankel's 1983 book, \"The Art of the Jewish Papercut\" (Migzerot neyar: omanut Yehudit amamit), was produced after 50 years of painstaking research. \n\nToday, Jewish papercut art has grown in popularity beyond ritual items to art and expressions of Jewish faith, not only in Israel but worldwide. Loloi contends that the resurgence in papercutting's popularity is in part due to its contemporary near-ubiquity as part of the ketubah (marriage contract), which is a contemporary site of \"hiddur mitzvah\", the Jewish principle of honouring the Divine by beautifying ritual objects. Contemporary papercutting art may also be seen in amulets like hamsas, blessings for the home, mizrahim, and other art pieces, usually as a wall plaque.\n\nIn Israel papercutting was reactivated by Giza Frankel, a Polish-born ethnographer. Frankel's most significant publications on paper cutting are \"Wycinanka żydowska w Polsce\" and \"Art of the Jewishpaper-cut.\" Giza Frankel brought knowledge of Polish Jewish paper cuts with her when she emigrated to Israel in 1950.\n\nAccording to Frankel, the most famous Polish papercutters are and .\n\nMarta Gołąb is both a graphic artist and papercutter. Her papercuts were exhibited in the Jewish Museum (Wien) Skirball Cultural Center, (Los Angeles), in Emanu-El Synagogue (San Francisco), in the Synagogue in Grobzig (Germany) and on the Jewish Culture Festival in Krakow.\n\nMonika Krajewska's interests was focus on symbols related both to Jewish papercut and sepulchral art, according to . She is a member of The Guild of American Papercuters.\n\nYehudit Shadur was a Jewish paper cutting artist.\n\nYehudit Shadur and her husband Joseph Shadur wrote a history of the last three centuries of Jewish paper cutting called \"Traditional Jewish Papercuts: An Inner World of Art and Symbol.\" They won a 1994 Jewish National Book Council prize for this book. In addition to this book, the Shadurs wrote an additional book on Jewish papercuts, the catalog on Yehudit Shadur's 1995 exhibit at the Haaretz Museum in Ramat Aviv, Israel, and several articles on the art of Jewish papercutting.\n\nTsirl Waletzky (née Tsirl Grobla) was considered to be a major contemporary paper cutting artist in American Yiddish culture. Waletzky’s papercuts differed from \"traditional forms in that they are free flowing and less bound to structure and symmetry.\"\n\nKim Phillips is a modern Jewish paper cut artist whose work pushes the limits of interpretation of Jewish texts and themes without reference to traditional symmetrical forms. Her work has been exhibited in Israel and in the United States.\n\nOren Loloi (Papercuts By Oren), is a modern Jewish paper cut artist working in Israel. His work belongs to a new aesthetic that bridges the gap between Jewish tradition and the modern resurgence of paper cutting worldwide. His work mainly focuses on ketubot. He has also been commissioned by synagogues in New York and Virginia for large scale works.\n\nDepending on their purpose, shape and connection with specific religious and non-religious events, paper cuts are of different types.\n\nA Mizrah (hebr. The East) is a plaque hung on the east wall of private houses to show the direction of Jerusalem. A shivis’i (hebr. always) is similar to a mizrah, but it hangs on the east side of a synagogue. Its name is connected with a sentence from the Bible: 'Shivis'i adonai l'negdi tamid' ('I have set the LORD always before me'). Shivis’i in the form of paper cuts rather than some more durable material were only used in poor synagogues.\n\nThere were also various paper cuts made for special, religious celebrations. Shevuoslekh (\"little Shavuots\") and \"royzelekh\" (rosettes) decorated windows for Shavuot. Royzelekh are circle-shaped paper cuts, while Shevuoslekh are rectangular. They were often made by pupils in elementary Jewish religious schools (Cheders). They were sometimes decorated with motifs unconnected to religion, such as soldiers or riders.\n\nFlags for Simchat-Torah were also made by \"cheder\" pupils. Created from colourful paper, each paper cut symbolized one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The other side of the paper showed an image of Torah with moving doors cut in paper. Paper cuts made for Sukkot were formed into lanterns, chains and birds, hung in Sukkahs.\n\nPaper cuts often decorated a plaque with a prayer called Ushpizin, made for Sukkot. Paper cuts were also created for Purim, often containing the Hebrew sentence: ”Mishenekhnas adar marbin b’simcha’ (‘We should rejoice because (the month of) Adar begins') and cut into an image of a bottle and glasses, a symbol of rejoicing.\n\nPapercutting also has connections with other forms of Jewish tradition. For example, Ketubahs (marriage agreements) were sometimes prepared in the form of paper cut, or decorated with paper cutting elements. Also cut into paper, memorial plaques were made to commemorate the names of ancestors’ names and dates of birth and death. Lanterns with papercut walls were placed in synagogues for anniversaries of great men’s death. Amulets like a Hamsa often showed an image of a palm with an eye on it.\n\nPaper cuts traditionally were created with the use of shoemaker’s knife. It is likely that most artists were men, though in later years, schoolgirls (and boys) made little rosettes (called \"royzelekh\" or \"reyzelekh\" in Yiddish) with scissors, to decorate their notebooks or for holiday decorations in the home. The artist first drew the pattern on a paper or parchment, and then cut it. Sometimes, they painted their work in watercolors. Paper cuts were usually glued to a contrasting background in a specific way, to bring the cut paper into relief. Hebrew sentences were important element of the composition. The words were either cut or drawn on paper. Elements of micrography, another traditional type of Jewish folk art, can be seen in these blocks of text created with the artist's knife. Due to Judaism's aniconism, it is rare to see a paper-cut from this period that depicts the human figure. Exceptions are Sephardic Ketubot depicting the bride and bridegroom.\n\nTraditionally, paper cuts made by Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews differed from each other. Ashkenazi papercuts were rich, highly detailed, and colourful. In this style, artists tried to fill the free space with as many elements as is possible. By contrast, the Sephardic compositions were more minimalist, including motifs such as the menorah, columns, arabesques and lanterns. Modern Jewish paper cut art is done in many styles and is not limited to the aforementioned symbols and motifs. They may be single-layered or multi-layered.\n\nEvery element of Jewish paper cut has its own symbolism. Some are typical of general Jewish culture, others are peculiar to the art of paper cutting. The most important symbols are placed along the axis of symmetry.\n\nThe main symbols are usually a Torah or a Menorah:\n\nA range of animals are depicted in paper cuts:\n\nPapercut flora is usually connected with the biblical Tree of Life, with some of the plants having their specific symbolism. For example, vine was associated with the land of Israel and with fertility, pomegranates symbolized fertility, etc.\n\nOthers symbols were connected both with tradition and with everyday life:\n\nThe images are created by cutting a design into a folded piece of paper. When the paper is unfolded, the symmetrical design is revealed. The paper can be cut using either scissors or a craft knife.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1941761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941761", "title": "Knight of the Swan", "text": "Knight of the Swan\n\nThe story of the Knight of the Swan, or Swan Knight, is a medieval tale about a mysterious rescuer who comes in a swan-drawn boat to defend a damsel, his only condition being that he must never be asked his name.\n\nThe earliest versions (preserved in \"Dolopathos\") do not provide specific identity to this knight, but the Old French Crusade cycle of \"chansons de geste\" adopted it to make the Swan Knight (\"Le Chevalier au Cigne\", first version around 1192) the legendary ancestor of Godfrey of Bouillon. The \"Chevalier au Cigne\", also known as Helias, figures as the son of Orient of L'Islefort (or Illefort) and his wife Beatrix in perhaps the most familiar version, which is the one adopted for the late fourteenth century Middle English \"Cheuelere Assigne\". The hero's mother's name may vary from Elioxe (probably a mere echo of Helias) to Beatrix depending on the text, and in a Spanish version, she is called Isomberte.\n\nAt a later time, the German poet Wolfram von Eschenbach incorporated the swan knight Loherangrin into his Arthurian epic \"Parzival\" (first quarter of the 13th century). A German text, written by Konrad von Würzburg in 1257, also featured a Swan Knight without a name. Wolfram's and Konrad's were used to construct the libretto for Richard Wagner's opera \"Lohengrin\" (Weimar 1850).\n\nAnother example of the motif is Brangemuer, the knight that lay dead in a boat tugged by a swan, and whose adventure was taken up by Gawain's brother Guerrehet (Gareth or Gaheris) in the first Continuation to Chrétien de Troyes' \"Perceval\".\n\nThe \"Swan-Children\" appears to have been originally separate from the Godfrey cycle and the Swan Knight story generally. Paris identifies four groups of variants, which he classifies usually by the name of the mother of the swan children.\nThe tale in all variants resemble not only such chivalric romances as \"The Man of Law's Tale\" and \"Emaré\", but such fairy tales as \"The Girl Without Hands\". It also bears resemblance to the fairy tale \"The Six Swans\", where brothers transformed into birds are rescued by the efforts of their sister.\n\nIncluded in Johannes de Alta Silva's \"Dolopathos sive de Rege et Septem Sapientibus\" (ca. 1190), a Latin version of the \"Seven Sages of Rome\" is a story of the swan children which has served as a precursor to the poems of the Crusade cycle. The tale was adapted into the French \"Li romans de Dolopathos\" by the poet Herbert. The story is as follows:\n\nA nameless young lord becomes lost in the hunt for a white stag and wanders into an enchanted forest where he encounters a mysterious woman (clearly a swan maiden or fairy) in the act of bathing, while clutching a gold necklace. They fall instantly for each other and consummate their love. The young lord brings her to his castle, and the maiden (just as she has foretold) gives birth to a septuplet, six boys and a girl, with golden chains about their necks. But her evil mother-in-law swaps the newborn with seven puppies. The servant with orders to kill the children in the forest just abandons them under a tree. The young lord is told by his wicked mother that his bride gave birth to a litter of pups, and he punishes her by burying her up to the neck for seven years. Some time later, the young lord while hunting encounters the children in the forest, and the wicked mother's lie starts to unravel. The servant is sent out to search them, and find the boys bathing in the form of swans, with their sister guarding their gold chains. The servant steals the boys' chains, preventing them from changing back to human form, and the chains are taken to a goldsmith to be melted down to make a goblet. The swan-boys land in the young lord's pond, and their sister, who can still transform back and forth into human shape by the magic of her chain, goes to the castle to obtain bread to her brothers. Eventually the young lord asks her story so the truth comes out. The goldsmith was actually unable to melt down the chains, and had kept them for himself. These are now restored back to the six boys, and they regain their powers, except one, whose chain the smith had damaged in the attempt. So he alone is stuck in swan form. The work goes on to say obliquely hints that this is the swan in the Swan Knight tale, more precisely, that this was the swan “\"quod cathena aurea militem in navicula trahat armatum\" (that tugged by a gold chain an armed knight in a boat).”\n\nThe Knight of the Swan story appears in the Old French \"chansons de geste\" of the first Crusade cycle, establishing a legendary ancestry of Godfrey of Bouillon, who in 1099 became ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Godfrey loomed large in the medieval Christian imagination, and his shadowy genealogy became a popular subject for writers of the period.\n\nThe swan-children tale occurs in the first or \"La Naissance du Chevalier au Cygne\" branch of the cycle. The texts can be classed into four versions, 1) \"Elioxe\", 2) \"Beatrix\", 3) an Elioxe-Beatrix composite, and 4) Isomberte. Of \"Isomberte\" no French copy survives, and it's known only from the Spanish \"Gran conquista de Ultramar\". \n\nElioxe follows the \"Dolopathos\" tale closest, but tells a courtlier version of the story, replacing the young lord who becomes lost with King Lothair, a ruler from beyond Hungary and the maiden with Elioxe. Lothair loses his way and stops by a fountain, and while asleep, is tended by Elioxe who comes out of the woodworks of the mountains. King Lothair decides to wed her, despite his mother's protest. However Elioxe foretells her own death giving birth to seven children, and that one of the offspring shall be king of the Orient.\n\nWhile Lothair is absent warring, the queen mother Matrosilie orders a servant to carry the children in two baskets and expose them in the forest, and prepares the lie that their mother gave birth to serpents and died from their bites. The servant however had left the children by the hermit's hut, so they survive, and seven years later are discovered by a greedy courtier named Rudemart. Allured by the gold chains the children are wearing, he obtains instruction from the queen mother to steal them, but failing to take account of their numbers, misses the chain belonging to the girl. The six boys bereft of the chains fly out in swan form, and their father Lothair issues an order of protection. The king's nephew tries to hunt one of the birds to please him, but the king in a fit hurls a gold basin which breaks. Matrosilie then provides one of the necklaces to make the repair. Eventually the truth is untangled through the sister of the swan siblings. All the boys regain human form but one. While other seek their own fortunes, one boy cannot part with his brother turned permanently into a swan, and becomes Swan Knight.\n\nIn the Beatrix variants, the woman had taunted another woman over her alleged adultery, citing a multiple birth as proof of it, and was then punished with a multiple birth of her own. In the Beatrix versions, the mother is also an avenging justice. In the Isomberte variants, the woman is a princess fleeing a hated marriage.\n\nVersion II involves the Swan Knight himself. These stories are sometimes attached to the story of the Swan Children, but sometimes appear independently, in which case no explanation of the swan is given. All of these describe a knight who appears with a swan and rescues a lady; he then disappears after a taboo is broken, but not before becoming the ancestor of an illustrious family. Sometimes this is merely a brief account to introduce a descendant. The second version of this tale is thought to have been written by the Norman trouvère Jean Renart.\n\nIn Brabant the name of the Knight of the Swan is \"Helias\". It has been suggested that this connects him to the Greek solar god, Helios, but the name is in fact a common variant of the name of the prophet Elijah, who nevertheless was connected to the Greek solar god by orthodox worship because of his association to Mount Horeb and a fire chariot.\n\nIn the early 13th century, the German poet Wolfram von Eschenbach adapted the Swan Knight motif for his epic \"Parzival\". Here the story is attached to Loherangrin, the son of the protagonist Parzival and the queen of Pelapeire Condwiramurs. As in other versions Loherangrin is a knight who arrives in a swan-pulled boat to defend a lady, in this case Elsa of Brabant. They marry, but he must leave when she breaks the taboo of asking his name.\n\nIn the late 13th century, the poet Nouhusius (Nouhuwius) adapted and expanded Wolfram's brief story into the romance \"Lohengrin\". The poet changed the title character's name slightly and added various new elements to the story, tying the Grail and Swan Knight themes into the history of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 15th century an anonymous poet again took up the story for the romance \"Lorengel\". This version omits the taboo against asking about the hero's name and origins, allowing the knight and princess a happy ending.\n\nIn 1848, Richard Wagner adapted the tale into his popular opera \"Lohengrin\", probably the work through which the Swan Knight story is best known today.\n\n"}

It may also be called a press mult box or press bridge. The sound engineer connects several microphones to allow all of them to get clean, high-quality audio.\n\nReporters use a mult box frequently at press conferences, especially when politicians give such interviews in small spaces, where not all the reporters in a press pool can access the interviewee.\n\nA whole set of etiquette and mores has developed amongst journalists governing the use of mult boxes. Because it is often difficult to get a good sound recording from a digital recorder for later broadcast or transcription for newspaper reporting, journalists have developed informal rules for their use. For example, the media should treat the sound engineer well, because while reporters can be selfish and competitive with each other, and the equipment can go wrong in many ways, the engineer allows all of them to get a good signal. It is also extremely important to show up early to press conferences; this \"early bird gets the worm\" habit allows one to test equipment, to avoid problems caused by the chaos of most press conferences, and to work cooperatively with the engineer.\n\nThe NCAA has a specific, written policy on the use of mult boxes for all NCAA championships.\n\nUnited States government agencies usually provide a mult box for media use at press conferences. However, they are not always consistent; the United States Department of Energy sometimes makes a mult box available, but then does not make a \"media avail with speakers\"; yet at other times does \"not\" allow a mult box but follows it up with a \"press availability\". Some state government agencies or courts also may provide such equipment for free to media, but charge a fee to rent it for private events held on state property.\n\nSome colleges and universities provide the use of a mult box \"gratis\" to media who need it to record large academic events such as commencement, speaker, or funeral, but charge for leasing to certain organizations. Larger houses of worship, such as a basilica or cathedral, may provide a mult box for certain religious services, but not others, depending on their policies and the nature of the mass or eucharist. Large media events, such as the Grammy Awards, Alamo Bowl, etc., often provide a mult box for media at their press conferences as a convenience.\n\nA mult box can be an extraordinarily expensive piece of audio-visual equipment to purchase, so many organizations rent them from a communications company or government agency. Larger venues may make them available to the media for free, but rent them to private parties.\n\nIn 2011, the United States Mission to the African Union donated a state of the art mult box to the cash-starved African Union in a formal ceremony, in which they also presented new interns who will be trained to use it.\n\n\n"}

After the distribution arm of the company went out of business in 1982, its processing centers and warehouses formed the basis for Diamond Comics Distributors, the now-dominant comics distributor. New Media's publishing arm continued in the business until 1985.\n\nHal Shuster, his father, Irwin, and his brother, Jack, formed the paper distribution company Irjax Enterprises (a play on the names \"Irwin\" and \"Jack\"), based in Rockville, Maryland, in the 1970s.\n\nAfter Phil Seuling established the direct market in 1972, his company Sea Gate Distributors maintained a virtual monopoly on comic book distribution, until a lawsuit brought by Irjax in 1978. Irjax sued the comic book publishers DC, Marvel, Archie, and Warren for their anti-competitive arrangement with Seagate. As a result of the lawsuit Irjax gained \"a sizeable chunk of the direct-distribution market,\" with distribution centers in Boston and Tampa. The Boston-area division was known as Solar Spice and Liquors (named after a fictional corporation created by science fiction writer Poul Anderson).\n\nMeanwhile, Baltimore retailer Steve Geppi had four comic book stores and was acting as a sub-distributor, \"doing a little informal distributing . . . for smaller retailers.\" By 1981, Geppi was one of New Media/Irjax's biggest accounts. In late 1981, the company, now known as New Media Distribution, or New Media/Irjax, filed for Chapter 11. One of the \"last loyal customers\" when New Media began having fiscal difficulties, Geppi made a deal with Shuster: \"[t]he owner was going into retail,\" so Geppi agreed to provide Shuster with \"free books for a period of time in return for his account list.\"\n\nWhen Hal Shuster relocated to Florida early in 1982, he asked \"Geppi to service more accounts for a bigger discount,\" thereby effectively selling Geppi the distribution end of the business. Geppi immediately founded Diamond Comics Distributors. Geppi took over New Media/Irjax's office and warehouse space and had to \"sort out the good customers from the bad overnight,\" negotiating with creditors to continue Shuster's distribution business as Diamond Comic Distributors.\n\nIn addition to its distribution business, New Media/Irjax acted as a small publisher from 1976 until 1985. Under the names Irjax Enterprises and then New Media Publishing, it mostly produced periodicals for comics and fantasy/science fiction enthusiasts, the most notable title being \"Comics Feature\". The company also published a few original comic book titles (in the adventure and fantasy genres), usually featuring creators pulled from the ranks of fandom. The company published out of Largo, Florida; Tampa, Florida; and finally Studio City, California.\n\nNotable names who worked for New Media/Irjax as editors and/or writers include Carol Kalish, Kurt Busiek, and Peter B. Gillis.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "433760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=433760", "title": "Nizami Ganjavi", "text": "Nizami Ganjavi\n\nNizami Ganjavi () (1141–1209), Nizami Ganje'i, Nizami, or Nezāmi, whose formal name was \"Jamal ad-Dīn Abū Muḥammad Ilyās ibn-Yūsuf ibn-Zakkī\", was a 12th-century Persian Sunni Muslim poet. Nezāmi is considered the greatest romantic epic poet in Persian literature, who brought a colloquial and realistic style to the Persian epic. His heritage is widely appreciated and shared by Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Iran, the Kurdistan region and Tajikistan.\n\nHis personal name was Ilyas and his chosen pen-name was Nezami (also spelled as Nizami and Neẓāmi). He was born of an urban background in Ganja (Seljuq empire, now Azerbaijan) and is believed to have spent his whole life in South Caucasus. According to De Blois, Ganja was a city which at that time had predominantly an Iranian population. The Armenian historian Kirakos Gandzaketsi (c. 1200 – 1271) mentions that: \"This city was densely populated with Iranians and a small number of Christians\".\nBecause Nezami was not a court poet, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties. Tazkerehs, which are the compilations of literary memoirs that include maxims of the great poets along with biographical information and commentary of styles refer to him briefly. Much of this material in these Tazkerehs are based on legends, anecdotes, and hearsays. Consequently, few facts are known about Nezami's life, the only source being his own work, which does not provide much information on his personal life.\n\nNezami was orphaned early and was raised by his maternal uncle Khwaja Umar who took responsibility for him and afforded him an excellent education. His mother, named \"Ra'isa\", was of Kurdish background. His father, whose name was \"Yusuf\" is mentioned once by Nezami in his poetry. In the same verse, Nezami mentions his grandfather's name as \"Zakki\". In part of the same verse, some have taken the word \"Mu'ayyad\" as a title for Zakki while others have interpreted it as the name of his great grandfather. Some sources have stated that his father might be possibly from Qom. Nezami is variously mentioned as a Persian and/or Iranian.\n\nNezami was married three times. His first wife was a Kipchak slave girl which was sent to him by Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of Darband, as part of a larger gift. According to Iraj Bashiri she became Nezami's \"most beloved\" wife. His only son \"Mohammad\" was from this wife. She died after \"Khosrow and Shirin\" was completed. Mohammad was seven at the time. Nezami mentions his son again in Layli and Majnun adding that now this son is 14 years old and \"apple of my eyes\". In \"Haft Peykar\" (Seven Beauties), he also mentions and advises his son about taking more responsibility as the father was growing more frail.\n\nSome modern writers in the late 20th century have claimed that this wife was called \"Afaq\". Vahid Dastgerdi seems to be the first writer to propose this name for Nezami's first wife, but Said Nafisi (at the same time) and a recent source have challenged this interpretation of the corresponding verse in Nezami's work and the assumption that \"Afaq\" was the real name of his wife and have taken the \"Afaq\" in that verse to simply mean \"horizon\" rather than a proper name. Strangely enough, Nezami's two other wives, too, died prematurely – the death of each coinciding with the completion of an epic, prompting the poet to say, \"God, why is it that for every mathnavi I must sacrifice a wife!\".\n\nNezami was not a philosopher in the sense of Avicenna or an expositor of theoretical Sufism in the sense of Ibn 'Arabi. However, he is regarded as a philosopher and gnostic who mastered various fields of Islamic thoughts which he synthesized in a way that brings to mind the traditions of later Hakims such as Qutb al-Din Shirazi.\n\nOften referred to by the honorific Hakim (\"the Sage\"), Nezami is both a learned poet and master of a lyrical and sensuous style. About Nezami's prodigious learning there is no doubt. Poets were expected to be well versed in many subjects; but Nezami seems to have been exceptionally so. His poems show that not only he was fully acquainted with Arabic and Persian literatures and with oral and written popular and local traditions, but was also familiar with such diverse fields as mathematics, astronomy, astrology, alchemy, medicine, botany, Koranic exegesis, Islamic theory and law, Iranian myths and legends, history, ethics, philosophy and esoteric thought, music, and the visual arts. His strong character, social sensibility, and knowledge of oral and written historical records, as well as his rich Persian cultural heritage unite pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran into the creation of a new standard of literary achievement. Being a product of the Iranian culture of the time, he not only created a bridge between pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran, but also between Iran and the whole ancient world.\n\nThe recent discovery and publication of the anthology titled \"Nozhat al-Majales\" contains Persian language quatrains from Nizami and 115 other poets from the northwestern Iran (Arrān, Šarvān, Azerbaijan; including 24 poets from Ganja alone) during the same era. Unlike other parts of Persia, where the poets mostly belonged to higher echelons of society such as scholars, bureaucrats, and secretaries, a good number of poets in the northwestern areas rose from among the common people with working-class backgrounds, and they frequently used colloquial expressions in their poetry. Accordingly, the book demonstrates the social conditions at the time, reflecting the full spread of Persian language and the culture in the region, which is evidenced by the common use of spoken idioms in poems and the professions of many of the poets. The influence of the northwestern Pahlavi language, for example, which had been the spoken dialect of the region, is clearly observed in the poems contained in this anthology. However, at the same time, the Caucasus region was entertaining a unique mixture of ethnic cultures. Khaqani's mother was a Nestorian Christian, Mojir Baylqani's mother was an Armenian, and Nezami's mother was a Kurd. Their works reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the region.\n\nBy the end of the 10th century, Persian literature became widespread from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus. The earliest extant example of Persian poetry from the area is that of Qatran Tabrizi(1009–1072) who served in the courts of the Shaddadid and Rawadid dynasties. Qatran Tabrizi, is credited with what some scholars in the last century have termed as the founder of the \"Azerbaijan\" or \"Trans-Cacausian\" school or \"Tabriz School\" or \"Shirvan School\" or \"Arranian Style\" of Persian poetry. This school produced a distinctive style of poetry in Persian, which contrasted with \"Khurasani\" (\"Eastern\") style in its rhetorical sophistication, its innovative use of metaphor, its use of technical terminology and Christian imagery, the presence of Persian archaism while borrowing from Arabic vocabulary, as well as new concepts. Other sources including the Encyclopaedia of Islam and traditional Iranian literary sources have used the term \"'Iraqi\" style for the Persian poetry of Nezami.\nThe Seljuqs took control of Ganja from the Shaddadids in 1075 and spread Persian literary westwards to their courts. In the middle of the 12th century, the Seljuks control of the region weakened and their provincial governors, virtually autonomous local princes, further encouraged Persian culture, art and poetry in their courts. Persian culture characteristically flourished in this era when political power was diffused and Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil cervants, merchants were in great demand and rival dynastines continue to vie for the service of Persian poets. This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived. Nezami was patronized by different rulers and dedicated his epics to various rival dynasties including the Seljuqs, Eldiguzids(who maintained control of Ganja during most of the later 12th century), Shirvanshahs, the ruler of Ahar and Ahmadilis. Although he enjoyed the patronage of various rulers and princes, he avoided the court life and is generally believed to have lived a secluded life. Since he was not a court poet, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties which list the names of events of the ruling families.\n\nAccording to Professor Chelkowski: \"It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading Firdawsi's monumental epic Shahnameh (The book of Kings)\". Nezami has mentioned Ferdowsi as the Sage (Hakim) and Knower/Wise (daanaa) and the great master of discourse: \"who has decorated words like new bride\". Nezami advises the son of the Shirvanshah to read the Shah-nama and to remember the meaningful sayings of the wise. Nezami has used the Shahnameh as a source in his three epics of \"Haft Paykar\", \"Khosrow and Shirin\" and \"Eskandar-nameh\".\n\nThe story of \"Vis and Ramin\" also had an immense influence on Nezami. Although Nezami takes the bases for most of his plots from Ferdowsi, but the basis for his rhetoric comes from Gorgani. This is especially noticeable in the Khosrow and Shirin, which is of the same meter and imitates some scenes from \"Vis and Ramin\". Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in \"Vis and Ramin\". Nezami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the Sufi influences, which are seen in Nezami's epic poetry.\n\nThe first monumental work of Nezami, the Makhzan al-Asrar is influenced by Sanai's \"Hadikat al-Hakika\". Nezami acknowledges this but considers his work to be superior. The main similarities between Sanai's poem and Nezami's are in its ethico-philosophical genre, although Nezami uses a different metre and organized the whole work in a different fashion. Khaqani Sherwani daring imagery, was to have a momentous influence on Nezami Ganjavi and through the latter on Persian poetry in general.\n\nNezami lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect; but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the many legends built up around the poet color the accounts of his later biographers.\n\nOnly a small corpus of his lyric poetry, mainly qaṣīdahs (\"odes\") and ghazals (\"lyrics\") have survived. Ten of his quatrains have also been recorded in the anthology Nozhat al-Majales (which was compiled around 1250) by Jamal Khalil Shirvani along with 23 other poets from Ganja. A famous ghazal of Nezami talks about altruism as the path for reaching the ultimate spiritual goal:\n\nNezami is best known for his five long narrative poems, which have been preserved. He dedicated his poems to various rulers of the region as was custom of that time for great poets, but avoided court life. Nezami was a master of the \"Masnavi\" style (double-rhymed verses). He wrote poetical works; the main one is the \"Panj Ganj\" (Persian: Five Treasures), also known by the Persian pronunciation of the Arabic word \"Khamsa\" (\"Quintet\" or \"Quinary\"). The first of his five 'Treasures', called \"The Storehouse of Mysteries\", was influenced by Sanai of Ghazna's (d. 1131) monumental Garden of Truth. The other ‘Treasures’ were medieval romances. Khusaw and Shirin, Bahrām-e Gur, and Alexander the Great, who all have episodes devoted to them in Ferdowsi's Book of Kings, appear again here at the center of three of four of Nezami's narrative poems. The adventure of the paired lovers, Leyli and Majnun, is the subject of the second of his four romances, and derived from Arabic sources. In all these cases, Nezami reworked the material from his sources in a substantial way.\n\nThe \"Khamsa\" was a popular subject for lavish manuscripts illustrated with painted miniatures at the Persian and Mughal courts in later centuries. Examples include the Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208), created for the Mughal Emperor Akbar in the 1590s.\n\nThe \"Quinary\" (Five Treasures-Panj Ganj) includes the five Persian books of Nezami:\n\nThe ethico-philosophical poems of about 2,250 Persian distichs was dedicated to Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of Erzinjan. The story deals with such esoteric subjects as philosophy and theology. The story contains twenty discourses, each of them portraying an exemplary story on religious and ethical topics. Each chapter concludes with apostrophe to the poet himself containing his pen name. The content of the poems are indicated in the heading to each chapter and are written in a typical Homiletics style. The stories which discuss spiritual and practical concerns enjoin kingly justice, riddance of hypocrisy, warning of vanity of this world and the need to prepare for the after-life. The general message of the discourse is that Nezami preaches the ideal way of life drawing attention to his reader of the supreme rank man among God's creatures and approaching of the end life and the necessity of man becoming aware of his spiritual destination. In a few chapters he address the duties of a King, but as a whole he addresses himself to mankind in general rather than his royal patrons. In the introduction, the poet provides an account of his solitary vigils, called Khalwat. There is no indication that these were Sufi vigils, but are used as a literally fantasy on the duty of spiritually inclined poet he wanted to be. In highly rhetorical style, the aim he pursues is to transcend the limitation of secular literature of the courts. With this work, Nezami joins the destination of Persian poetry which had started with Sanai and was continued by others, in the first place by Attar.\n\nNot a romantic epic, \"The Treasury of Mysteries\" was translated into English by Gholam H. Darab in 1945. After this early work, Nezami turned into narrative poetry.\n\nA story of pre-Islamic Persian origin which is found in the great epico-historical poems of Shahnameh and is based on a true story that was further romanticized by Persian poets. The story chosen by Nezami, was commissioned and dedicated to the Seljuk Sultan Toghril II, the Atabek Muhammad ibn Eldiguz Jahan Pahlavan and his brother Qizil Arslan. It contains about 6,500 distichs in length, the story depicts the love of Sassanian Khosrow II Parviz towards his Armenian princess Shirin. \"Khusrow and Shirin\" recounts the story of King Khosrow's courtship of Princess Shirin, and vanquishing of his love-rival, Farhad. The story has a complex structure with several genres exploited simultaneously; and contains many verbal exchanges and letters, all imbued with lyrical intensity. Khosrow endures long journeys, physical and spiritual, before returning to Shirin, his true love. They are eventually married, but eventually Khosrow is killed by his son and Shirin commits suicide over the body of her murdered husband. Pure and selfless love is represented here embodied in the figure of Farhad, secretly in love with Shirin, who finally falls victim to the king's ire and jealousy.\n\nThe influence of Vis o Ramin is visible as the poem imitates a major scene (that of the lovers arguing in the snow) from Vis o Rāmin, as well as being in the same meter (\"hazaj\") as Gorgāni's poem. Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in Vis o Rāmin. In turn, Nezami's great work had a tremendous influence on later authors and many imitations of this work were made. With complete artistic and structural unity, the epic of Khosrow o Shirin turned to be a turning point not only for Nizami but for all of Persian literature.\n\n\nA story of Arabic origin which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians. The poem of 4,600 distichs was dedicated, in 1192, to Abu al-Muzaffar Shirvanshah, who claimed descent from the Sassanid King, whose exploits are reflected in Nezami's \"Seven Beauties\"(Haft Paykar). The poem is based on the popular Arab legend of ill-starred lovers: the poet Qays falls in love with his cousin Layla, but is prevented from marrying her by Layla's father. Layla's father forbids contact with Qays and Qays becomes obsessed and starts signing of his love for Layla in public. The obsession becomes so severe that he sees and evaluates everything in terms of Layla; hence his sobriquet \"the possessed\" (Majnun). Realizing that cannot obtain union even when other people intercede for him, he leaves society and roams naked in the desert among the beasts. However the image of Layla was so ingrained in him that he cannot eat or sleep. His only activity becomes composing poetry of longing for Layla. Meanwhile, Layla is married against her will, but she guards her virginity by resisting the advances of her husband. Arranging a secret meeting with Majnun, they meet, but have no physical contact. Rather they recite poetry to each other from a distance. Layla's husband dies eventually which removes the legal obstacles to a licit union. However Majnun is so focused on the ideal picture of Layla in his mind that he had fled to the desert. Layla dies out of grief and is buried in her bridal dress. Hearing this news, Majun rushes to her grave where he instantly dies. They are buried side by side and their grave becomes a site of pilgrimage. Someone dreams that in Paradise they are united and live as a king and queen. Nezami composed his romance at the request of the Shirvanshah Akhsatan. Initially, he doubted that this simple story about the agony and pain of an Arab boy wandering in rough mountains and burning deserts would be a suitable subject for royal court poetry and his cultured audience. It was his son who persuaded him to undertake the project, saying: \"wherever tales of love are read, this will add spice to them\". Nezami used many Arabic anecdotes in the story but also adds a strong Persian flavor to the legend. He adapted the disconnected stories about Majnun to fit the requirement of a Persian romance.\n\nHe Persianises the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc. and adapts the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance.\n\n\"The Story of Layla and Majnun by Nizami\", was translated and edited by Dr. Rudolf Gelpke into an English version in collaboration with E. Mattin and G. Hill Omega Publications and published in 1966. A comprehensive analysis in English containing partial translations of Nezami's romance Layla and Majnun examining key themes such as chastity, constancy and suffering through an analysis of the main characters was recently accomplished by Ali Asghar Seyed-Gohrab.\n\n\nThe Romance of Alexander the Great\" contains 10,500 distichs. There are differences of opinion on whether this was Nezami's last epic or the Haft Paykar. The names of its dedicatees are uncertain but the ruler of Ahar, Nosart al-Din Bishkin b. Mohammad has been mentioned. The story is based on Islamic myths developed about Alexander the Great, which derive from Qur'anic references to the Dhu'l-Qarnayn as well as from the Greek Alexander romance of Pseudo-Callisthenes. It consists of two books, Sharaf-Nama and Iqbal-nameh. The poem narrates the three stages in Alexander's life: first as the conqueror of the world; then as a seeker after knowledge, gaining enough wisdom to acknowledge his own ignorance; and finally as a prophet, traveling once again across the world, from west to east, and south to north to proclaim his monotheistic creed to the world at large. The Sharaf-nama discusses the birth of Alexander, his succession to the throne of Rum (Greece), his wars against Africans who invaded Egypt, his conquest of Persia and his marriage to the daughter of Darius. The episode also discusses Alexander's pilgrimage to Mecca, his stay in the Caucasus and his visit to Queen Nushaba of Barda' and her court of Amazons. Alexander conquers India, China and the land of the Rus. The Sharafnama concludes with Alexander's unsuccessful search for the water of immortal life.\n\nThe Iqbal-nameh is a description of Alexander's personal growth into the ideal ruler on a model ultimately derived, through Islamic intermediaries, from Plato's Republic. He has debates with Greek and Indian philosophers (c.f. with Garshaspnama) and a major portion of the text is devoted to the discourses he has with seven Greek sages. The poet then tells of Alexander's end and adds an account of the circumstances of the death of each of the seven sages. Nezami's image of Alexander is that of an Iranian knight.\n\nAn English translation of the Sharaf-Nama by Henry Wilberforce-Clarke was published in 1881 under the title Sikandar Nama e Bara and is available online.\n\n\nA pre-Islamic story of Persian origin, it was dedicated to the ruler of Maragha, 'Ala' Al-Din korp Arslan. It is the story of Bahram V, the Sassanid king, who is born to Yazdegerd after twenty years of childlessness and supplication to Ahura Mazda for a child. The Haft Paykar is a romanticized biography of the Sasanian Persian empire ruler Bahram Gur. His adventurous life had already been treated by Ferdowsi in the Shahnama, to which fact Nezami alludes a number of times. In general, his method is to omit those episodes that the earlier poet had treated, or to touch on them only very briefly, and to concentrate on new material. The poet starts by giving an account of the birth of Bahram Gur and his upbringing in the court of the Arab King No'man and his fabled palace Khwarnaq. Bahram whose upbringing is entrusted to Nom'man becomes a formidable huntsman. While wandering through the fabled palace, he discovers a locked room which contains a depiction of seven princesses; hence the name Haft Paykar (seven beauties). Each of these princesses is from the seven different climes (traditional Zoroastrian-Islamic division of the Earth) and he falls in love with them. His father Yazdegerd I passes away and Bahram returns to Persia to claim his throne from pretenders. After some episodes he is recognized as King and rescues the Persians from a famine. Once the country is stable, the King searches for the seven princesses and wins them as his brides. His architect is ordered to construct seven domes for each of his new brides. The architect tells him that each of the seven climes is ruled by one of the seven planets (classical planetary system of Zoroastrian-Islamic world) and advises him to assure good fortune by adorning each dome with the color that is associated with each clime and planet. Bahram is skeptical but follows the advice of the architect. The princesses take up residence in the splendid pavilions. On each visit, the king visits the princesses on successive days of the week; on Saturday the Indian princess, who is governed by Saturn and so on. The princesses names are Furak (Nurak), the daughter of the Rajah of India, as beautiful as the moon; Yaghma Naz, the daughter of the Khaqan of the Turks; Naz Pari, the daughter of the king of Khwarazm; Nasrin Nush, the daughter of the king of the Slavs; Azarbin (Azareyon), the daughter of the king of Morocco; Humay, the daughter of the Roman Caesar; and Diroste (wholesome), a beautiful Iranian princess from the House of Kay Ka'us. Each princess relates to the king a story matching the mood of her respective color. These seven beautifully constructed, highly sensuous stories occupy about half of the whole poem. While the king is busy with the seven brides, his evil minister seizes power in the realm. Bahram Gur discovers that the affairs of Persia are in disarray, the treasury is empty and the neighboring rulers are posed to invade. He clears his mind first by going hunting. After returning from hunt, he sees a suspended dog from a tree. The owner of the dog, who was shepherd, tells the story of how his faithful watchdog had betrayed his flock to a she-wolf in return for sexual favors. He starts investigating the corrupt minister and from the multitude of complaints, he selects seven who tell him the injustice they have suffered. The minister is subsequently put to death and Bahram Gur restores justice and orders the seven pleasure-domes to be converted to fire temples for the pleasure of God. Bahram then goes hunting for the last time but mysteriously disappears. As a pun on words, while trying to hunt the wild ass (\"gūr\") he instead finds his tomb (\"gūr\").\n\nRitter, in his introduction to the critical edition describes it as: \"the best and most beautiful epic in New Persian poetry and at the same time . . . one of the most important poetical creations of the whole of oriental Indo-European literature\". The Haft Paykar is considered the poet's masterpiece. Overall, in this masterpiece, Nezami illustrates the harmony of the universe, the affinity of the sacred and the profane, and the concordance of ancient and Islamic Iran.\n\nThe story was translated to English in 1924 by Charles Edward Wilson. A newer English rendering based on more complete manuscripts was accomplished by Professor Julia Scott Meysami.\nAn excerpt (Original Persian):\nThe influence of Neẓāmi's work on the subsequent development of Persian\nliterature has been enormous and the Khamsa became a pattern that was emulated in later Persian poetry (and also in other Islamic literatures). The legacy of Nezami is widely felt in the Islamic world and his poetry has influenced the development of Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish and Urdu poetry amongst many other languages.\n\nIn Persian miniature, the stories in Nezami's poems alongside those of Ferdowsi's Shahnama have been the most frequently illustrated literary works.\nAccording to the Encyclopædia Britannica: \"Nezami is admired in Persian-speaking lands for his originality and clarity of style, though his love of language for its own sake and of philosophical and scientific learning makes his work difficult for the average reader\". Nezami composed his verses in Persian and Western Encyclopedias such as Encyclopedia of Islam, Encyclopædia Iranica, Encyclopædia Britannica and orientalists of many countries consider Nezami as a significant Persian poet and hail him as the greatest exponent of romantic epic poetry in Persian literature.\n\nAmongst the many notable poets who have taken the Five Treasures of Nezami as their model may be mentioned Amir Khusro, Jalal Farahani, Khwaju Kermani, Mohammad Katebi Tarr-Shirini, Abdul Rahman Jami, Hatefi Jami, Vahshi Bafqi, Maktabi Shirazi, Ali-Shir Nava'i, Abdul Qader-e Bedel Dehlavi, Fuzûlî, Hashemi Kermani, Fayzi, Jamali and Ahmad Khani. Not only poets, but historians such as Rawandi were also influenced by Nezami's poetry and used his poem in rendering history. Besides these, scores of poets have started their composition with the first line of the Makhzan al-Asrar.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rudolf Gelpke: \"Many later poets have imitated Nizami's work, even if they could not equal and certainly not surpass it; Persians, Turks, Indians, to name only the most important ones. The Persian scholar Hekmat has listed not less than forty Persians and thirteen Turkish versions\" of Layli and Majnun.\n\nAccording to Vahid Dastgerdi, \"If one would search all existing libraries, one would probably find more than 1000 versions of Layli and Majnun\".\n\nJami in his Nafahatol Ons remarks that: \"Although most of Nezami's work on the surface appear to be romance, in reality they are a mask for the essential truths and for the explanation of divine knowledge\".\n\nJami in his Baharestan mentions that: \"Nezami's excellence is more manifest than the sun and has no need of description\". Hashemi of Kerman remarks: \"The empire of poetry obtained its law and order from Nezami's beautiful verses\" and \"To present words before Nezami's silent speech is a waste of time\".\n\nAmir Khusro writes:<br>\n\"The ruler of the kingdom of words, famed hero,<br>\nScholar and poet, his goblet [glass] toasts.<br>\nIn it – pure wine, it's drunkingly sweet,<br>\nYet in goblet [glass] beside us – only muddy setting.\"\n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe writes:<br>\n\"A gentle, highly gifted spirit, who, when Ferdowsi had completed the collected heroic traditions, chose for the material of his poems the sweetest encounters of the deepest love. Majnun and Layli, Khosrow and Shirin, lovers he presented; meant for one another by premonition, destiny, nature, habit, inclination, passion staunchly devoted to each other; but divided by mad ideas, stubbornness, chance, necessity, and force, then miraculously reunited, yet in the end again in one way or another torn apart and separated from each other.\"\n\nWith regards to the recitation of his poetry, Peter Chelkowski states: \"The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has alway beens vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is revential. Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the Musha'areh, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. for richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled\".\n\nNezami's story of Layla and Majnun also provided the namesake for a hit single by Eric Clapton, also called \"Layla\". Recorded with Derek and the Dominos, \"Layla\" was released on the 1970 album \"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\". The album was highly influenced by Nezami and his poetry of unrequited love. The fifth song of \"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\", \"I Am Yours\", was in fact a Nezami composition, set to music by Clapton.\n\nIn 2004, there was a conference on Nezami organized in the University of Cambridge. The book containing the proceedings of this conference was published under the title: \"Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of Hakim \" in 2011 by Leiden Press.\n\nThe Soviet ballet produced a film, \"Leili and Medjnun\", named after a poem by Nizami Gandjevi. The ballet \"Seven Beauties\" by Azerbaijani composer Gara Garayev, based on Nezami's famous poem, won an international acclaim.\n\nA minor planet 3770 Nizami, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh in 1974 is named after him. The Museum of Azerbaijan literature in Baku is named after Nezami.\n\nNezami was depicted on the obverse of the Azerbaijani 500 manat banknote of 1993–2006. In 2008, coinciding with the 800th anniversary of his death, the National Bank of Azerbaijan minted a 100 manat gold commemorative coin dedicated to his memory.\n\nThe Nizami Museum of Literature is located in Baku, Azerbaijan. One of the Baku Metro stations is also named after Nizami Ganjavi. There is Institute of Literature named after Nizami and Cinema named after Nizami in Baku. One of the districts of Baku is called Nizami raion. The life of Nizami Ganjavi is shown in the Azerbaijani movie \"Nizami\" (1982), in which the leading role, role of Nizami Ganjavi, was played by Muslim Magomayev. The Nizami Mausoleum, built in honor of Nizami, stands just outside the city of Ganja in Azerbaijan. It is a tall cylindrical building, surrounded by gardens. To one side, there is a metal statue commemorating Nizami's epic poems. The mausoleum was originally built in 1947 in place of an old collapsed mausoleum, and rebuilt in its present form after Azerbaijan Republic regained its independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nMonuments to Nezami are found in many cities of Azerbaijan and Iran, as well as in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Udmurtiya (Russia), Kiev (Ukraine), Beijing (China), Tashkent (Uzbekistan), Marneuli (Georgia), Chişinău (Moldova), Rome (Italy).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Focused on being \"technically ambitious and socially engaged,\" it is dedicated to producing new works that have an aspect of social awareness and using the theatre process to allow students to learn about theatre. The group takes its name from its history of having no permanent theatre to work in. \n\nThe group produces three main stage shows a year, usually performed in the Walsh Black Box (no longer in use), the Village C Theatre, or the Devine Theatre in the Davis Performing Arts Center in the center of Georgetown's campus. Main stage shows are directed, produced, acted, designed largely by students. Often students in large roles such as director, producer, or designer, will have an assistant who they train to be able to perform that role on a future show.\n\nThe group also produces \"Square Pegs\", opportunities for students to get involved in theatre without a large time commitment. These have a much shorter rehearsal process and have minimal technical elements and are often performed in the open air amphitheatre in Red Square or in Bulldog Alley in the Leavey Center.\n\nNomadic was created in 1982 under the name \"D&B Productions\" by a group of members from the Mask & Bauble Dramatic Society (M&B) who were tired of the Shakespeare and traditional theatre that M&B was known for. Their first show was \"Harvey\", about a man who befriends an imaginary giant rabbit. The group's second production, \"The Fantasticks\", shifted its early focus to musical theater. The name \"Nomadic Theatre\" was not used by the group until the spring, 1984 show, \"Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris\", and was adopted because of the administration's unwillingness to allow the group to reserve facilities for fixed rehearsal locations, thus necessitating cast members for any given show to memorize the \"standard progression\" of locations where rehearsal space would be sought, and walk from one to the next until the evening's location was found. All of the group's belongings, consisting mostly of costume pieces, a few props, and a complete tool set purchased through the Roy Rogers restaurant points collection game, were kept in a closet illegally occupied by it in the basement of Xavier Hall. During the early years of the group, it produced a series of musical productions (\"Jacques Brel...\", the Jones and Schmidt musical \"Philemon\", \"A Night in the Ukraine\", \"Sweeney Todd\", \"What's a Nice Country Like You Doing In A State Like This?\" and \"Evita\") before changing to a non-musical focus.\n\nIn 2005 a new building, the Davis Performing Arts Center (DPAC), was constructed. Nomadic and other theatre groups on campus were able to use the advanced scene shop and costume shop for working on their shows, but the building's theatre spaces were to be reserved mainly for faculty directed shows. However, in March 2006, Nomadic Theatre were able to teamed up with the Department of Performing Arts at Georgetown for the first student production ever staged in the Devine Theatre of the building. In 2007, Nomadic became the first group to have a full-scale, student-run show in the Devine, with \"Translations\". Since then Nomadic has regularly performed in the building.\n\nIn the Spring of 2010 members of Nomadic Theatre were instrumental in the organization of Hate-Free Georgetown, a week-long celebration to \"promote unity and respect on campus\".\n\n2017-18:\n\n\n2016-17:\n\n\n2015-16:\n\n\n2014-15:\n\n\n2013-14:\n\n2012-13:\n\n2011-12:\n\n2010-11:\n\n2009-10:\n\n2008-9:\n\n2007-8:\n\n2006-7:\n\n2005-6:\n\n2004-2005:\n\n1986-1987\n\n1985-1986\n\n1984-1985\n\n1983-1984\n\n1982-1983\n"}

The purpose of the document is to govern the internal operations of the business in a way that suits the specific needs of the business owners. Once the document is signed by the members of the limited liability company, it acts as an official contract binding them to its terms. Many states in the United States require an LLC to have an operating agreement. LLCs operating without an operating agreement are governed by the state's default rules contained in the relevant statute and developed through state court decisions. An operating agreement is similar in function to corporate by-laws, or analogous to a partnership agreement in multi-member LLCs. In single-member LLCs, an operating agreement is a declaration of the structure that the member has chosen for the company and sometimes used to prove in court that the LLC structure is separate from that of the individual owner and thus necessary so that the owner has documentation to prove that he or she is indeed separate from the entity itself.\n\nMost states do not require operating agreements. However, an operating agreement is highly recommended for multi-member LLCs because it structures an LLC's finances and organization, and provides rules and regulations for smooth operation. The operating agreement usually includes percentage of interests, allocation of profits and losses, member's rights and responsibilities and other provisions.\nOperating agreements are legally significant. Having a correctly drafted operating agreement is crucial in case legal disputes arise between business owners.\n\n"}
{"id": "3117545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3117545", "title": "Paracopyright", "text": "Paracopyright\n\nParacopyright (\"pseudocopyright\" or \"metacopyright\") is legal protection above and beyond traditional copyright. The most often cited example is \"legal protection for technical measures\" from the 1996 WIPO Internet treaties. Paracopyright provisions in these treaties are not about the term or scope of copyright, but instead are about providing legal protections for the technologies that may be used by copyright holders. \n\nParacopyrights afford legal protection to technologies that claim to be used to protect copyrights, but that are ineffective in that goal. A technical measure can not stop a technically sophisticated person who wishes to infringe copyright. To use the \"digital locks\" analogy, there is no need to \"pick the lock\" as the keys necessary to decode the content are embedded within authorized access technology. Both the locked content and the technology containing the key are commercially available to an infringer. Once a single person decodes a technical measure, the decoded content can be made available to others in the same way as if the technical measure never existed.\n\nThe effect of these technical measures are to impose specific contractual license agreements on those conforming to copyright law. As a concept, therefore, paracopyrights are perhaps better understood as a part of contract law and not copyright law. Unfortunately, important regulations regarding consumer protection and the \"freedom to contract\" are not imported directly into paracopyright laws, potentially creating imbalances in the law and harmful unintended consequences.\n\nCopyright is traditionally understood as a statutorily defined bundle of exclusive rights provided to copyright holders. An infringement of copyright takes place when someone exercises one or more of the copyright holder’s exclusive rights without his or her permission. Anti-circumvention and anti-device provisions do not fit under this paradigm of a bundle of exclusive rights. On one hand, a copyright owner has the exclusive right to copy his or her work, and that exclusive right is infringed when someone else copies the work without permission. It is quite another story, however, to think about copyright holders having the exclusive right to circumvent TPMs (Technical Protection Measure) that they apply to their works, and the exclusive right to make and distribute devices that enable or facilitate circumvention of TPMs. Even assuming that this problem could be overcome, attempting to force anti-circumvention and anti-device provisions to fit the mold of the bundle of rights paradigm seems to necessitate adding a number of related rights to the bundle, including the exclusive right to apply a TPM to a copyright work.\n\n\n\"Examples where the term has been used\"\n\n"}
{"id": "4987062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4987062", "title": "Policraticus", "text": "Policraticus\n\nPolicraticus was the first book of political science to be produced during the Middle Ages. Written by John of Salisbury around 1159, it belongs to the genre of advice literature known as \"mirrors for princes\", and is addressed to the territorial ruler. Though it takes up a wide variety of ethical questions, it is most famous for attempting to define the responsibilities of kings and their relationship to their subjects. \n\nPolicraticus is a pseudo Greco-Roman neologism term, meaning \"the statesman.\" Salisbury drew his arguments from several different sources, including the Bible and the Justinian Code. He argued for the divine right of kings, saying that\n\n...the prince stands on a pinnacle which is exalted and made splendid with all the great and high privileges which he deems necessary for himself. And rightly so, because nothing is more advantageous to the people than that the needs of the prince should be fully satisfied; since it is impossible that his will should be found opposed to justice. Therefore, according to the usual definition, the prince is the public power, and a kind of likeness on earth of the divine majesty. Beyond doubt a large share of the divine power is shown to be in princes by the fact that at their nod men bow their necks and for the most part offer up their heads to the axe to be struck off, and, as by a divine impulse, the prince is feared by each of those over whom he is set as an object of fear. And this I do not think could be, except as a result of the will of God. For all power is from the Lord God, and has been with Him always, and is from everlasting.\n\nThis divine source allowed princes to wage just wars and required all subjects to submit to the prince's will. Salisbury argued that the prince had four responsibilities: Revere God, adore his subjects, exert self-discipline and instruct his ministers. Salisbury advocated strict punishments for lèse majesté, but argued that a prince should err on the side of mercy and compassion when enforcing his laws.\n\nWhile recognizing a prince's supreme temporal power, Salisbury argued that princes must be subordinate to the will of God and the Church.\n\nFor myself, I am satisfied and persuaded that loyal shoulders should uphold the power of the ruler; and not only do I submit to his power patiently, but with pleasure, so long as it is exercised in subjection to God and follows His ordinances. But on the other hand if it resists and opposes the divine commandments, and wishes to make me share in its war against God; then with unrestrained voice I answer back that God must be preferred before any man on earth. Therefore inferiors should cleave and cohere to their superiors, and all the limbs should be in subjection to the head; but always and only on condition that religion is kept inviolate.\n\nIn Salisbury's mind, a tyrant sets a poor example for his people and could lead them from God. His example was the Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate, who attempted to restore Rome's pagan religion. In this case, Salisbury argued that killing a regent, when all other resources were exhausted, was not only justifiable but necessary, and he called a tyrant an \"image of depravity . . . [who] spring(s) from evil and should be cut down with the axe wherever he grows.\" This may be the first defense of tyrannicide to be written after Antiquity.\n\n"}

Its initial name (Professional Union of Polish Writers) came from the similar organization formed in 1920 by renowned Polish novelist Stefan Żeromski, called \"Związek Zawodowy Literatów Polskich\" which was deactivated during World War II. \n\nThe name was shortened to Polish Writers' Union at the 1949 conference in Szczecin, in order to reflect the new government-imposed policy of Socialist realism in Poland advanced by the Polish communist party of that period. In the following years, the two official organs of ZLP were \"Twórczość\" monthly and the weekly \"Nowa Kultura\". After the socialist revolution of 1956 the Union became less of a political arm of the United Workers' Party, and more of a true writers' organization devoted to creative output and the well-being of its members. \n\nIn communist Poland, the ZLP was the only official representation of the country's literary community. In 1980, the Union consisted of 1,349 participants gathered in its 17 regional chapters. It had an annual budget set by the state with numerous special funds and permits allowing for food supplements, medical clinics, foreign travel, cars, vacations, stipends and cash prizes for the inner circle. Its leaders lived a life of privilege, while some of the writers are known to have worked for the secret police, spying on others. \n\nOn 13 December 1981 the authoritarian government of the People's Republic of Poland introduced martial law in an attempt to crush political opposition. Pro-democracy movements such as Solidarity were banned and their leaders detained. The Union of Polish Writers was suspended. Some of its dissident members were jailed and dozens blacklisted. At the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee meeting the writers loyal to the new regime condemned the leaders of ZLP as disreputable. The Union was disbanded in 1983. It was reinstated the same year by communist hardliners based on a new pledge of loyalty, which caused a deep rift in its highly politicized community. Many former members did not renew their cards.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet union in 1989, the ZLP lost its state sponsorship. An alternative, new writers' union was also formed, called Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich (The Society of Polish Writers). As of now, both organizations have their headquarters at the \"Dom Literatury\" (Literary House) in Warsaw at ul. Krakowskie Przedmieście street, in a historic building which they own collectively.\n\n\n"}

This may be due to an accident, such as scorching one's hair when lighting a gas fire, or a deliberate method of treatment or removal of hair or other fibres.\n\nA singe is a treatment available at a barber's. A lit taper (candle) or other device is used to lightly burn and shrivel the hair. The practice of singeing was popular approximately a century ago; it was believed that hair had \"fluid\" in it and singeing would trap the fluid in. Singeing is supposed to have beneficial effects – sealing cut ends, closing up the follicles, preventing the hair from bleeding (This belief has since been debunked.) and encouraging it to grow. Singeing is still sometimes used to bond natural hair to hair extensions.\n\nPrimitive cultures have also used singeing as a means to trim scalp or body hair, as a part of normal grooming or during ritual activity.\n\nSir Francis Drake was famously said to have figuratively \"singed the King of Spain's beard\" when he raided Cadiz and burnt the Spanish fleet.\n\nIn the agricultural industry, poultry and pork is singed to remove stub feathers and bristles. Kiwifruit vine leaders and canes are sometimes cauterised as a treatment for \"Pseudomonas syringae\" bacterial infection.\n\nIn the textile industry, loose fibres protruding on the surface of textile goods are singed to remove them. When done to fabrics containing cotton, this results in increased wettability, better dyeing characteristics, improved reflection, no \"frosty\" appearance, a smoother surface, better clarity in printing, improved visibility of the fabric structure, less pilling and decreased contamination through removal of fluff and lint.\n\nThe process is usually to pass one or both sides of a fabric over a gas flame to burn off the protruding fibres. Other methods include infra-red or heat for thermoplastic fibers. Singeing of yarns is called \"gassing\". It is usually the first step after weaving or knitting, though the fabric may be brushed first to raise the surface fibres.\n\nCellulose fibres such as cotton are easily singed because the protruding fibers burn to a light ash which is easily removed. Thermoplastic fibres are harder to singe because they melt and form hard residues on the fabric surface.\n\n"}

The story is a tale of a prince living in seclusion within a far-off tower filled with many luxuries, in Southern Asia (India). The story focuses on his encounter with an old man, who comes to the prince in a dream and offers a view of what the ‘outside world’ is truly about. This encounter shapes the prince’s view of the outside world, as well as his developing views on morality and the importance and reason of life. \n\nA young prince, who is raised from infancy in a large tower, has been brought up in a world of luxuries, decadence, but is also brought up without a sense of the true worth of money and material goods. He is brought up with many slaves, companions and attendants, but has never set foot outside the tower. Everything the Prince knows about the world comes from the stories and tales that his slaves and attendants, who are replaced over and over again, have told him. \n\nThe Prince believes that he knows what is going on outside the tower thanks to these stories until one day, a new man arrives at the tower. The newcomer, an old man, begins to discuss what is happening in the 'outside world' and about what the meaning of “gold” is and what having wealth truly means. At first, being exposed to nothing but luxury his whole life, the young Prince focuses on the importance of gold in the world. But he later realizes through a dream that gold and luxuries are not as important as hard work, charity, empathy and ethics. The danger of gold and greed is revealed to the Prince when he realizes the importance of work and charity after seeing the people in his dream torn apart by avarice. Upon waking, the Prince suddenly understands the implications of putting too much importance on material things. Upon realizing this, the old man disappears, leaving the Prince with a humbling perspective about the world around him.\n\nJean Ingelow (March 17, 1820 and died on July 20, 1897) was an English born poet and novelist.

{"id": "15419237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15419237", "title": "Transformation design", "text": "Transformation design\n\nIn broad terms, transformation design is a human-centered, interdisciplinary process that seeks to create desirable and sustainable changes in behavior and form – of individuals, systems and organizations – often for socially progressive ends.\n\nIt is a multi-stage, iterative process applied to big, complex issues – often social issues.\n\nIts practitioners examine problems holistically rather than reductively to understand relationships as well as components to better frame the challenge. They then prototype small-scale systems – composed of objects, services, interactions and experiences – that support people and organizations in achievement of a desired change. Successful prototypes are then scaled.\n\nBecause transformation design is about applying design skills in non-traditional territories, it often results in non-traditional design outputs. Projects have resulted in the creation of new roles, new organizations, new systems and new policies. These designers are just as likely to shape a job description, as they are a new product.\n\nThis emerging field draws from a variety of design disciplines - service design, user-centered design, participatory design, concept design, information design, industrial design, graphic design, systems design, interactive design, experience design - as well as non-design disciplines including cognitive psychology and perceptual psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, architecture, haptics, information architecture, ethnography, storytelling and heuristics.\n\nThough academics have written about the economic value of and need for transformations over the years, its practice first emerged in 2004 when The Design Council, the UK’s national strategic body for design, formed RED: a self-proclaimed “do-tank” challenged to bring design thinking to the transformation of public services.\n\nThis move was in response to Prime Minister Tony Blair’s desire to have public services “redesigned around the needs of the user, the patients, the passenger, the victim of crime.”\n\nThe RED team, led by Hilary Cottam, studied these big, complex problems to determine how design thinking and design techniques could help government rethink the systems and structures within public services and possibly redesign them from beginning to end.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2006, the RED team, in collaboration with many other people and groups, developed techniques, processes and outputs that were able to “transform” social issues such as preventing illness, managing chronic illnesses, senior citizen care, rural transportation, energy conservation, re-offending prisoners and public education.\n\nIn 2015 Braunschweig University of Art / Germany has launched a new MA in Transformation Design. In 2016 The Glasgow School of Art Launched another masters program \"M.Des in Design Innovation and Transformation Design\".\n\nTransformation design, like user-centered design, starts from the perspective of the end user. Designers spend a great deal of time not only learning how users currently experience the system and how they want to experience the system, but also co-creating with them the designed solutions.\n\nBecause transformation design tackles complex issues involving many stakeholders and components, more expertise beyond the user and the designer is always required. People such as, but not limited to, policy makers, sector analysts, psychologists, economists, private businesses, government departments and agencies, front-line workers and academics are invited to participate in the entire design process - from problem definition to solution development.\n\nWith so many points-of-view brought into the process, transformation designers are not always ‘designers.’ Instead, they often play the role of moderator. Though varying methods of participation and co-creation, these moderating designers create hands-on, collaborative workshops (a.k.a. charrette) that make the design process accessible to the non-designers.\n\nIdeas from workshops are rapidly prototyped and beta-tested in the real world with a group of real end users. Their experience with and opinions of the prototypes are recorded and fed back into the workshops and development of the next prototype.\n\n1. http://www.designcouncil.info/RED/ RED's homepage \n2. http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/ Design Council's homepage \n3. http://www.designcouncil.info/mt/RED/transformationdesign/TransformationDesignFinalDraft.pdf White Paper published by RED which discusses transformation design \n4. http://www.designcouncil.info/mt/RED/transformationdesign/ RED's website page which talks about transformation design \n5. http://www.torinoworlddesigncapital.it/portale/en/content.php?sezioneID=10 Interview with Hilary Cottam at World Design Capital \n6. https://web.archive.org/web/20070818190054/http://www.hilarycottam.com/html/RED_Paper%2001%20Health_Co-creating_services.pdf Whitepaper on co-creation\n7. \"The Experience Economy\", B.J.

She was an early and influential participant in the underground comix movement, and one of the first few female artists in that movement. Both as a cartoonist and historian, Robbins has long been involved in creating outlets for and promoting female comics artists. In the 1980s, Robbins became the first woman to draw \"Wonder Woman\" comics. She is a member of the Will Eisner Hall of Fame.\n\nRobbins was an active member of science fiction fandom in the 1950s and 1960s. Her illustrations appeared in science fiction fanzines like the Hugo-nominated \"Habakkuk\".\n\nRobbins' first comics were printed in the \"East Village Other\"; she also contributed to the spin-off underground comic \"Gothic Blimp Works\".\n\nIn 1969, Robbins designed the costume for the Warren Publishing character Vampirella, for artist Frank Frazetta in \"Vampirella\" #1 (Sept. 1969).\n\nShe left New York for San Francisco in 1970, where she worked at the feminist underground newspaper \"It Ain't Me, Babe\". That same year she, along with fellow female artist Barbara \"Willy\" Mendes, established the first all-woman comic book, the one-shot \"It Ain't Me, Babe Comix\". From this period on, Robbins became increasingly involved in creating outlets for and promoting female comics artists, through projects such as the comics anthology \"Wimmen's Comix\", with which she was involved for twenty years. \"Wimmen's Comix\" #1 featured Robbins' \"Sandy Comes Out\", the first-ever comic strip featuring an \"out\" lesbian.\n\nRobbins became increasingly outspoken in her beliefs, criticizing underground comix artist Robert Crumb for the perceived misogyny of many of his comics. She said, \"It's weird to me how willing people are to overlook the hideous darkness in Crumb's work ... What the hell is funny about rape and murder?\"\n\nIn the early 1980s Robbins created adaptations of Sax Rohmer's \"Dope\" and Tanith Lee's \"The Silver Metal Lover\". In the mid-1980s she wrote and drew \"Misty\" for the Marvel Comics children's imprint Star Comics. The short-lived series was a reinterpretation of the long-standing character Millie the Model, now an adult running her own modeling agency and minding her niece Misty.\n\nRobbins' official involvement with Wonder Woman, a character she had long admired, began in 1986. At the conclusion of the first volume of the series (in conjunction with the series \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"), DC Comics published a four-issue limited series titled \"The Legend of Wonder Woman\", written by Kurt Busiek and drawn by Robbins. Robbins was the first woman to draw Wonder Woman comics. The series paid homage to the character's Golden Age roots. She also appeared as herself in \"Wonder Woman Annual 2\" (1989). In the mid-1990s, Robbins criticized artist Mike Deodato's \"bad girl art\" portrayal of Wonder Woman, calling Deodato's version of the character a \"barely clothed hypersexual pinup.\" In the late 1990s, Robbins collaborated with Colleen Doran on the DC Comics graphic novel \"Wonder Woman: The Once and Future Story\", on the subject of spousal abuse.\n\nRobbins has been writing the comic book adventures of Honey West, notable as being one of popular fiction's first female private detectives.\n\nIn addition to her comics work, Robbins is an author of nonfiction books on the history of women in cartooning.\n\nHer first book, co-written with Catherine Yronwode, was \"Women and the Comics,\" a history of female comic-strip and comic-book creators. As one of the first books ever published on this subject, it was covered in the mainstream press, in addition to the fan press. Subsequent Robbins volumes on women in the comics industry include \"A Century of Women Cartoonists\" (Kitchen Sink, 1993), \"The Great Women Superheroes\" (Kitchen Sink, 1997), \"From Girls to Grrrlz: A History of Women’s Comics from Teens to Zines\" (Chronicle, 1999), and \"The Great Women Cartoonists\" (Watson-Guptill, 2001). Her most recent work, \"Pretty In Ink\", published by Fantagraphics, covers the history of North American women in comics from Rose O'Neill's 1896 strip \"The Old Subscriber Calls\" to present.\n\nRobbins was a co-founder of Friends of Lulu, a nonprofit formed in 1994 to promote readership of comic books by women and the participation of women in the comic book industry.\n\nRobbins is featured in the feminist history film \"She's Beautiful When She's Angry\".\n\nRobbins was intimately involved in the 1960s rock scene, where she was close friends with Jim Morrison and The Byrds. She is the first of the three \"Ladies of the Canyon\" in Joni Mitchell's classic song from the album of the same name. In the late 1960s she ran an East Village clothing boutique called \"Broccoli\" and made clothes for Mama Cass, Donovan, David Crosby and others. She has written a memoir entitled \"Last Girl Standing\", scheduled for release in 2017 from Fantagraphics. Her partner is artist Steve Leialoha.\n\nRobbins was a Special Guest of the 1977 San Diego Comic-Con, when she was presented with an Inkpot Award. She won a Special Achievement Award from the San Diego Comic Con in 1989 for her work on \"Strip AIDS U.S.A.\", a benefit book that she co-edited with Bill Sienkiewicz and Robert Triptow.\n\nShe was the 1992 Guest of Honor of WisCon, the Wisconsin Science Fiction Convention.\n\nIn 2002, Robbins was given the Special John Buscema Haxtur Award, a recognition for comics published in Spain.\n\nIn 2011, Robbins' artwork was exhibited as part of the Koffler Gallery show \"Graphic Details: Confessional Comics by Jewish Women\".\n\nIn July 2013, during the San Diego Comic-Con, Robbins was one of six inductees into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame. The award was presented by \"Mad\" magazine cartoonist and \"Groo the Wanderer\" creator Sergio Aragonés. The other inductees were Lee Falk, Al Jaffee, Mort Meskin, Joe Sinnott, and Spain Rodriguez.\n\nIn a 2015 poll, Robbins was ranked #25 among the best female comics creators of all-time.\n\nIn 2017, Robbins was chosen for the Wizard World Hall of Legends.\n\nIn consideration of her contributions to the comic art form and her work as a historian, Comics Alliance listed Robbins as one of twelve women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2932442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2932442", "title": "Visual design elements and principles", "text": "Visual design elements and principles\n\nVisual design elements and principles describe fundamental ideas about the practice of visual design.\n\nDesign elements are the basic units of any visual design which form its structure and convey visual messages. Painter and design theorist Maitland E. Graves (1902-1978), who attempted to gestate the fundamental principles of aesthetic order in visual design, in his book, \"The Art of Color and Design\" (1941), defined the elements of design as line, direction, shape, size, texture, value, and color, concluding that \"these elements are the materials from which all designs are built.\"\n\nColor is the result of light reflecting back from an object to our eyes. The color that our eyes perceive is determined by the pigment of the object itself. Color theory and the color wheel are often referred to when studying colour combinations in visual design. Color is often deemed to be an important element of design as it is a universal language which presents the countless possibilities of visual communication. \n\nHue, saturation, and brightness are the three characteristics that describe color.\n\n\nColor theory studies colour mixing and colour combinations. It is one of the first things that marked a progressive design approach. In visual design, designers refer to color theory as a body of practical guidance to achieving certain visual impacts with specific colour combinations. Theoretical color knowledge is implemented in designs in order to achieve a successful color design.\n\n\nColor harmony, often referred to as a \"measure of aesthetics\", studies which colour combinations are harmonious and pleasing to the eye, and which colour combinations are not. Color harmony is a main concern for designers given that colors always exist in the presence of other colors in form or space.\n\nWhen a designer harmonizes colours, the relationships among a set of colours are enhanced to increase the way they compliment one another. Colors are harmonized to achieve a balanced, unified, and aesthetically pleasing effect for the viewer. \n\nColor harmony is achieved in a variety of ways, some of which consist of combining a set of colors that share the same hue, or a set of colors that share the same values for two of the three color characteristics (hue, saturation, brightness). Colour harmony can also be achieved by simply combining colors that are considered compatible to one another as represented in the color wheel.\n\n\nColor contrasts are studied with a pair of colours, as opposed to color harmony, which studies a set of colours. In color contrasting, two colors with perceivable differences in aspects such as luminance, or saturation, are placed side by side to create contrast. \n\nJohannes Itten presented seven kinds of color contrasts: contrast of light and dark, contrast of hue, contrast of temperature, contrast of saturation, simultaneous contrast, contrast of sizes, and contrast of complementary. These seven kinds of color contrasts have inspired past works involving color schemes in design.\n\n\nColor schemes are defined as the set of colors chosen for a design. They are often made up of two or more colors that look appealing beside one another, and that create an aesthetic feeling when used together. Color schemes depend on color harmony as they point to which colors look pleasing beside beside one another. \n\nA satisfactory design product is often accompanied by a successful color scheme. Over time, color design tools with the function of generating color schemes were developed to facilitate color harmonizing for designers.\n\nLine is an element of art defined by a point moving in space. Lines can be vertical, horizontal, diagonal or curved. They can be any width or texture. And can be continuous, implied, or broken. On top of that, there are different types of line, aside from the ones previously mentioned. For example, you could have a line that is \nhorizontal and zigzagged or a line that is vertical and zigzagged. Different lines create different moods, it all depends on what mood you are using a line to create.\n\nA point is basically the beginning of “something” in “nothing”. It forces the mind to think upon its position and gives something to build upon in both imagination and space. Some abstract points in a group can provoke human imagination to link it with familiar shapes or forms\n\nA shape is defined as a two or more dimensional area that stands out from the space next to or around it due to a defined or implied boundary, or because of differences of value, color, or texture. Shapes are recognizable objects and forms and are usually composed of other elements of design. \n\nFor example, a square that is drawn on a piece of paper is considered a shape. It is created with a series of lines which serve as a boundary that shapes the square and separates it from the space around it that is not part of the square. \n\nGeometric shapes or mechanical shapes are shapes that can be drawn using a ruler or compass, such as squares, circles, triangles, ellipses, parallelograms, stars, and so on. Mechanical shapes, whether simple or complex, produce a feeling of control and order.\n\nOrganic shapes are irregular shapes that are often complex and resemble shapes that are found in nature. Organic shapes can be drawn by hand, which is why they are sometimes subjective and only exist in the imagination of the artist.\n\nCurvilinear shapes are composed of curved lines and smooth edges. They give off a more natural feeling to the shape. In contrast, rectilinear shapes are composed of sharp edges and right angles, and give off a sense of order in the composition. They look more manmade, structured, and artificial. Artists can choose to create a composition that revolves mainly around one of these styles of shape, or they can choose to combine both.\n\nTexture refers to the physical and visual qualities of a surface. \n\n\n\nTactile texture, also known as \"actual texture\", refers to the physical three-dimensional texture of an object. Tactile texture can be perceived by the sense of touch. A person can feel the tactile texture of a sculpture by running their hand over its surface and feelings its ridges and dents. \n\n\nVisual texture, also referred to as \"implied texture\", is not detectable by our sense of touch, but by our sense of sight. Visual texture is the illusion of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface. Any texture perceived in an image or photograph is a visual texture. A photograph of rough tree bark is considered a visual texture. It creates the impression of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface which would remain smooth to the touch no matter how rough the represented texture is..\n\nIn painting, different paints are used to achieve different types of textures. Paints such as oil, acrylic, and encaustic are thicker and more opaque and are used to create three-dimensional impressions on the surface. Other paints, such as watercolor, tend to be used for visual textures, because they are thinner and have transparency, and do not leave much tactile texture on the surface.\n\nMany textures appear to repeat the same motif. When a motif is repeated over and over again in a surface, it results in a pattern. Patterns are frequently used in fashion design or textile design, where motifs are repeated to create decorative patterns on fabric or other textile materials. Patterns are also used in architectural design, where decorative structural elements such as windows, columns, or pediments, are incorporated into building design.\n\nIn design, space is concerned with the area deep within the moment of designated design, the design will take place on. For a two-dimensional design, space concerns creating the illusion of a third dimension on a flat surface:\n\n\nIn visual design, form is described as the way an artist arranges elements in the entirety of a composition. It may also be described as any three-dimensional object. Form can be measured, from top to bottom (height), side to side (width), and from back to front (depth). Form is also defined by light and dark. It can be defined by the presence of shadows on surfaces or faces of an object. There are two types of form, geometric (man-made) and natural (organic form). Form may be created by the combining of two or more shapes. It may be enhanced by tone, texture or color. It can be illustrated or constructed.\n\nPrinciples applied to the elements of design that bring them together into one design. How one applies these principles determines how successful a design may be.\n\nAccording to Alex White, author of \"The Elements of Graphic Design\", to achieve visual unity is a main goal of graphic design. When all elements are in agreement, a design is considered unified. No individual part is viewed as more important than the whole design. A good balance between unity and variety must be established to avoid a chaotic or a lifeless design.\n\n\n\nIt is a state of equalized tension and equilibrium, which may not always be calm.\n\n\nA good design contains elements that lead the reader through each element in order of its significance. The type and images should be expressed starting from most important to the least important.\n\nUsing the relative size of elements against each other can attract attention to a focal point. When elements are designed larger than life, scale is being used to show drama.\n\nDominance is created by contrasting size, positioning, color, style, or shape.The focal point should dominate the design with scale and contrast without sacrificing the unity of the whole.\n\nPlanning a consistent and similar design is an important aspect of a designer's work to make their focal point visible. Too much similarity is boring but without similarity important elements will not exist and an image without contrast is uneventful so the key is to find the balance between similarity and contrast.\n\nThere are several ways to develop a similar environment:\n\n\nMovement is the path the viewer’s eye takes through the artwork, often to focal areas. Such movement can be directed along lines edges, shape and color within the artwork, and more.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1548372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1548372", "title": "Visual literacy", "text": "Visual literacy\n\nVisual literacy is the ability to interpret, negotiate, and make meaning from information presented in the form of an image, extending the meaning of literacy, which commonly signifies interpretation of a written or printed text. Visual literacy is based on the idea that pictures can be \"read\" and that meaning can be through a process of reading.\n\nThe notion of visual literacy has been around for quite some time. Classical and Medieval theories of memory and learning, for instance, placed a strong emphases on how the visual format of words and lines affected the ordering of information in the mind. During the Enlightenment new emphasis was placed on training the senses through print and manuscript technologies in a way that benefitted the rising middle class. In addition to learning to read visual material like tables and figures, many schoolchildren learned how to write and draw in graphic patterns that made their notes more accessible and easier to access. By the nineteenth century visual literacy was a core component of the national educations systems that were emerging in Europe and North America, with educational reformers like Sir John Lubbock arguing for visual tools like diagrams and models to be used in the classroom.\n\nThe term \"visual literacy\" is credited to John Debes, co-founder of the International Visual Literacy Association. In 1969 Debes offered a tentative definition of the concept: \"Visual literacy refers to a group of vision-competencies a human being can develop by seeing and at the same time having and integrating other sensory experiences.\" A white paper drawn up in January 2004, defines visual literacy as \"understanding how people perceive objects, interpret what they see, and what they learn from them\". However, because multiple disciplines such as visual literacy in education, art history and criticism, rhetoric, semiotics, philosophy, information design, and graphic design make use of the term visual literacy, arriving at a common definition of visual literacy has been contested since its first appearance in professional publications.\n\nSince technological advances continue to develop at an unprecedented rate, educators are increasingly promoting the learning of visual literacies as indispensable to life in the information age. Similar to linguistic literacy (meaning-making derived from written or oral human language) commonly taught in schools, most educators would agree that literacy in the 21st Century has a wider scope. Educators are recognizing the importance of helping students develop visual literacies in order to survive and communicate in a highly complex world.\n\nMany scholars from the New London Group such as Courtney Cazden, James Gee, Gunther Kress, and Allan Luke advocate against the dichotomy of visual literacy versus linguistic literacy. Instead, they stress the necessity of accepting the co-presence of linguistic literacies and visual literacies as interacting and interlacing modalities which complement one another in the meaning making process.\n\nVisual literacy is not limited to modern mass media and new technologies. The graphic novel \"\" by Scott McCloud discusses the history of narrative in visual media. Also, animal drawings in ancient caves, such as the one in Lascaux, France, are early forms of visual literacy. Hence, even though the name visual literacy itself as a label dates to the 1960s, the concept of reading signs and symbols is prehistoric.\n\nVisual literacy is the ability to evaluate, apply, or create conceptual visual representations. Skills include the evaluation of advantages and disadvantages of visual representations, to improve shortcomings, to use them to create and communicate knowledge, or to devise new ways of representing insights. The didactic approach consists of rooting visualization in its application contexts, i.e. giving the necessary critical attitude, principles, tools and feedback to develop their own high-quality visualization formats for specific problems (problem-based learning). The commonalities of good visualization in diverse areas, and exploration of the specificities of visualization in the field of specialization (through real-life case studies).\n\nVisual Literacy Standards for teaching in higher education were adopted by the Association of College & Research Libraries in 2011. They were \"developed over a period of 19 months, informed by current literature, shaped by input from multiple communities and organizations, reviewed by individuals from over 50 institutions, and approved by 3 ACRL committees and the ACRL Board of Directors\".\n\nThere are many different formats of visual literacy and also many different ways of teaching students how to interpret visual literacy. Questions to be asked when looking at visuals can be \"What is going on in this photograph?\" and \"What comes to mind when you first look at this photograph?\". This allows students to begin the analyzing process. When looking at visuals, students should be able to see, understand, think, create and communicate graphically. In order to do all, the student must always carefully observe.\n\nFilm director Martin Scorsese emphasizes how children should begin developing visual literacy skills at an early age. This involves exploring how ideas and emotions are expressed and the use of lighting to create an emotional or physiological point. He explains how there is a need for children to understand these concepts. Visual literacy is taught in many schools and is becoming a more popular subject throughout the years. With technology, images and visual presentations are flourishing more than ever.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3771489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3771489", "title": "Wedgwood", "text": "Wedgwood\n\nJosiah Wedgwood and Sons, commonly known as Wedgwood, is a fine china, porcelain, and luxury accessories company founded on 1 May 1759 by English potter and entrepreneur Josiah Wedgwood.\n\nIn 1987, Wedgwood merged with Waterford Crystal to create Waterford Wedgwood, an Ireland-based luxury brands group. The main assets of Waterford Wedgwood were purchased in 2009 by KPS Capital Partners, a New York-based private equity firm. At that time, the group became known as WWRD Holdings Limited, an acronym for \"Waterford Wedgwood Royal Doulton\". In July 2015, it was acquired by Fiskars Corporation, a Finnish consumer goods company.\n\nAt the outset, Josiah Wedgwood worked with the established potter Thomas Whieldon until 1759, when relatives leased him the \"Ivy House\" in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, which allowed him to start his own pottery business. His marriage to Sarah Wedgwood, a distant cousin with a sizable dowry, helped him launch his new venture.\n\nIn 1765, Wedgwood created a new form of creamware, a fine glazed earthenware, which impressed the then British Queen consort Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who gave official permission to call it \"Queen's Ware\". This new form sold extremely well across Europe. In 1766, Wedgwood bought \"Etruria\", a large Staffordshire estate, as both a home and factory site. Wedgwood developed a number of further industrial innovations for his company, notably a way of measuring kiln temperatures accurately and the new ware types \"Black Basalt\" and \"Jasper Ware\".\n\nWedgwood's best known product is jasperware, created to look like ancient cameo glass. It was inspired by the Portland Vase, a Roman vessel which is now a museum piece. The first jasperware colour was Portland Blue, an innovation that required experiments with more than 3,000 samples. In recognition of the importance of his pyrometric beads (pyrometer), Josiah Wedgwood was elected a member of the Royal Society in 1783. The Wedgwood Prestige collection sold replicas of the original designs, as well as modern neo-classical style jasperware.\n\nThe main Wedgwood motifs in jasperware – as well as in other wares like basaltware, queensware, caneware, etc. – were decorative designs that were highly influenced by the ancient cultures being studied and rediscovered at that time, especially as Great Britain was expanding its empire. Many motifs were taken from ancient mythologies: Roman, Greek and Egyptian. Meanwhile, archaeological fever caught the imagination of many artists. Nothing could have been more suitable to satisfy this huge business demand than to produce replicas of ancient artefacts.\nMany representations of royalty, nobles and statesmen in silhouette were created, as well as political symbols. These were often set in jewellery, as well as in architectural features like fireplace mantels, mouldings and furniture.\nWedgwood has honoured American individuals and corporations as well, both historically and recently. In 1774 he employed the then 19-year-old John Flaxman as an artist, who would work for the next 12 years mostly for Wedgwood. The \"Dancing Hours\" may be his most well known design. Other artists known to have worked for Wedgwood include among others Lady Elizabeth Templetown, George Stubbs, Emma Crewe and Lady Diana Beauclerk.\n\nWedgwood had increasing success with hard paste porcelain which attempted to imitate the whiteness of tea-ware imported from China, an extremely popular product amongst high society. High transport costs and the demanding journey from the Far East meant that the supply of chinaware could not keep up with increasingly high demand. Towards the end of the 18th century other Staffordshire manufacturers introduced bone china as an alternative to translucent and delicate Chinese porcelain. In 1812 Wedgwood produced their own bone china which, though not a commercial success at first eventually became an important part of an extremely profitable business.\nJosiah Wedgwood was also a patriarch of the Darwin–Wedgwood family. Many of his descendants were closely involved in the management of the company down to the time of the merger with the Waterford Company:\n\nEnoch Wedgwood (1813–1879), a distant cousin of the first Josiah, was also a potter and founded his own firm, Wedgwood & Co, in 1860. It was taken over by Josiah Wedgwood & Sons in 1980.\n\nIn 1968, Wedgwood purchased many English potteries including Mason's Ironstone, Johnson Brothers, Royal Tuscan, William Adams & Sons, J. & G. Meakin and Crown Staffordshire. In 1979, Waterford Wedgwood purchased the Franciscan Ceramics division of Interpace in the United States. The Los Angeles plant closed in 1984 and production of the Franciscan brand was moved to Johnson Brothers in Britain. In 1986, Waterford Glass Group plc purchased Wedgwood plc, forming the company Waterford Wedgwood plc.\n\nIn 1986, Waterford Glass Group plc purchased Wedgwood plc for US$360 million, with Wedgwood delivering a 38.7 million USD profit in 1998 (while Waterford itself lost $28.9 million), after which the group was renamed Waterford Wedgwood plc. From early 1987 to early 1989, the CEO was Patrick Byrne, previously of Ford, who then became CEO of the whole group. During this time, he sold off non-core businesses and reduced the range of Wedgwood patterns from over 400 to around 240. In the late 1990s, the CEO was Brian Patterson. From 1January 2001, the Deputy CEO was Tony O'Reilly, Junior, who was appointed CEO in November of the same year and resigned in September 2005. He was succeeded by the then-president of Wedgwood USA, Moira Gavin, up until the company went into administration in 2009.\n\nIn 2001, Wedgwood launched a collaboration with designer Jasper Conran, which started with a white fine bone china collection then expanded to include seven patterns. In March 2009, KPS Capital Partners acquired the Waterford Wedgwood group assets. Assets including Wedgwood, Waterford and Royal Doulton were placed into WWRD Holdings Limited.\n\nOn 5January 2009, following years of financial problems at group level, and after a share placement failed during the global financial crisis of 2008, Waterford Wedgwood was placed into administration on a \"going concern\" basis, with 1,800 employees remaining. On 27February 2009, Waterford Wedgwood's receiver Deloitte announced that the New York-based private equity firm KPS Capital Partners had purchased certain Irish and UK assets of Waterford Wedgwood, and the assets of its Irish and UK subsidiaries.\n\nIn March 2009, KPS Capital Partners announced that it had acquired group assets in a range of countries (including the UK, USA and Indonesia), would invest €100 million, and would move a number of jobs to Asia to cut costs and return the firm to profitability. In a move that had begun under the previous owners, approximately 1,500 jobs were cut in the UK, leaving 800 workers in the UK producing only the high-end Wedgwood products. KPS Capital Partners placed Wedgwood into a group of companies known as WWRD, an abbreviation for \"Waterford Wedgwood Royal Doulton\".\n\nOn 11May 2015, in a deal expected to close in July 2015, Fiskars Corporation, a Finnish maker of home products, agreed to buy 100% of the holdings of WWRD. On 2 July 2015, the acquisition of WWRD by Fiskars Corporation was completed, including the brands Waterford, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Royal Albert and Rogaška. The acquisition was approved by the US antitrust authorities.\n\nWedgwood's founder wrote as early as 1774 that he wished he had preserved samples of all the company's works, and he began to do so. The first formal museum was opened in May 1906, with a curator named Isaac Cook, at the main (Etruria) works. The contents of the museum were stored for the duration of the Second World War and relaunched in a gallery at the new Barlaston factory in 1952. A new purpose-built visitor centre and museum was built in 1975 and remodelled in 1985, with pieces displayed near items from the old factory works in cabinets of similar period. A video theatre was added and a new gift shop, as well as an expanded demonstration area, where visitors could watch pottery being made. A further renovation costing £4.5 million was carried out in 2000, including access to the main factory itself.\n\nAdjacent to the museum and visitor centre are a restaurant and tea room, serving on Wedgwood ware. The museum, managed by a dedicated trust, closed in 2000 and on 24 October 2008, it reopened in a new multimillion-pound building.\n\nIn June 2009, the Wedgwood Museum won a UK Art Fund Prize for Museums and Art Galleries for its displays of Wedgwood pottery, skills, designs and artefacts. In May 2011, the archive of the museum was inscribed in UNESCO's UK Memory of the World Register.\n\nThe collection with 80,000 works of art, ceramics, manuscripts, letters and photographs faced being sold off to help satisfy pension debts inherited when Waterford Wedgwood plc went into receivership in 2009. The Heritage Lottery Fund, the Art Fund, various trusts and businesses contributed donations to purchase the collection. On December 1 2014, the collection was purchased and donated to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The collection will continue to be on display at the Wedgwood Museum on loan from the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nThe Minton Archive comprises papers and drawings of the designs, manufacture and production of the defunct pottery company Mintons. It was acquired by Waterford Wedgwood in 2005 along with other assets of the Royal Doulton group. At one time it seemed the Archive would become part of the Wedgwood collection. In the event, the Archive was presented by the Art Fund to the City of Stoke-on-Trent, but it was envisaged that some material would be displayed at Barlaston as well as the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery.\n\nWedgwood railway station was opened in 1940 to serve the Wedgwood complex in Staffordshire, England.\n\n"}
{"id": "16874601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16874601", "title": "Winter Garden Theatre (1850)", "text": "Winter Garden Theatre (1850)\n\nThe first theatre in New York City to bear the name The Winter Garden Theatre had a brief but important seventeen-year history (beginning in 1850) as one of New York's premier showcases for a wide range of theatrical fare, from Variety shows to extravagant productions of the works of Shakespeare. Initially known as Tripler's Hall or Metropolitan Hall, it burned down in 1854 and was rebuilt as The New York Theatre. Although it burned to the ground several times, it rose from the ashes under different managers, bearing various names, to become known as one of the most important theatres in New York history.\n\nSome of the leading actors and theatre managers of the 19th century worked at The Winter Garden Theatre, from Jenny Lind and Laura Keene to Dion Boucicault and Edwin Booth. One of the most significant and politically influential productions in American theatre history took place on a single night at The Winter Garden Theatre on November 25, 1864, when three sons of one of America's great tragedians, Junius Brutus Booth, namely Junius Brutus Booth, Jr., Edwin Booth, and John Wilkes Booth staged a benefit performance of Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\" to raise funds to build a statue of Shakespeare in Central Park; four months later John Wilkes would assassinate Abraham Lincoln in Washington D.C. as he cried out the historic words of Brutus in ancient Rome. Throughout its seventeen-year history, The Winter Garden Theatre played a significant role in the history of the American theatre.\n\nThe theatre was originally planned in 1850 for the first engagement of the famous singer from Sweden, Jenny Lind, known as the \"Swedish Nightingale\". Located at 667 Broadway, New York, across from Bond Street just south of Amity Street (today's West Third Street), the new theatre was to be \"one of the largest musical halls in the world,\" boasting one of the largest stages in New York.\nDelays in construction meant that the theatre wasn't finished in time for Lind's first show. She arrived to great fanfare and a reported gathering of over 40,000 (all arranged by her manager, P. T. Barnum), but without the theatre being built for her; instead, Miss Lind opened at New York City's Castle Garden. The theatre that was to have opened with \"the name of Jenny Lind [that] would attract attention all over the country\", was instead later opened and was christened Tripler Hall, thereafter playing numerous minstrel shows, an entertainment then quite fashionable on the American stage.\n\nThere were a few notable exceptions to these theatrical diversions, demonstrating that Tripler Hall had a more legitimate reputation during this period. In December 1850 an important ceremonial meeting was attended by thousands of Freemasons of New York City at Tripler Hall, of which it was written: \"the event was regarded and still is regarded [1899] as a landmark in the history of Freemasonry in the history of New York.\" In February 1852 a memorial service was held at Tripler Hall for the renowned American novelist James Fenimore Cooper, presided over by the noted statesman Daniel Webster, with a eulogies said by Washington Irving, and William Cullen Bryant. That same year William Thackeray concluded a national tour with a lecture at Tripler Hall.\n\nThe theatre went through several different managers during this period, each manager naming the theatre as he or she pleased. When the theatre was used for the American Art-Union Prizes Distribution, a report in \"The Illustrated London News\" gave an interesting description of the interior of Tripler Hall:\n\n\"Never - not even on the nights of the \"Nightingale\" - has the capacity of Tripler Hall been more fully booked than the evening appointed for the distribution of the Art Union prices. The immense floor (30 feet wider than Kester Hall), the aisles, the galleries before the stage, and beside the doors, were crowded to excess.\"\n\nOn May 15, 1855, the theatre passed to new management with a musical by John and Morris Barnett called \"Monsieur Jacques\", and was renamed Metropolitan Hall, and managed by John Lafarge, owner of the famed Lafarge House which adjoined the theatre.\n\nOn December 27, 1855, the actress and manager Laura Keene reopened the theatre as Laura Keene's Varieties with \"Old Heads and Young Hearts.\"\n\nHere the leading female impresario of New York produced an eclectic form of entertainment which she would perfect in subsequent productions such as the musical \"Seven Sisters\" five years later.\n\nA rare etching of the interior of the theatre at this time depicts a production by Laura Keene in her theatre; From the point of view of the stage, it depicts what is probably the production of a classical text, with two figures in historical costumes standing downstage close to the footlights. This etching, from the actors' point of view, gives a rare glimpse into theatrical production on the American stage in the pre-Civil War era.\nDespite the success of the theatre under the management of Laura Keene, the Panic of 1857 bankrupted the theatre and it was forced to be closed once again.\n\nThis house was reopened Sept. 8, 1856 as Burton's New Theatre, managed by William Evans Burton, with \"The Rivals.\" In 1858, Joseph Jefferson performed in the burlesque \"Mazeppa\" by F. A. Brady in which he was drawn across the stage atop a Crandall horse.\n\nDuring the summer of 1859, the daring actor–playwright–manager Dion Boucicault, called \"the most conspicuous English dramatist of the 19th century\", tried his hand at management, took over the theatre, and gave the theatre its final name of The Winter Garden Theatre with the opening of his original burlesque \"Chamooni III\" on October 19, 1859. The theatre was aptly named The Winter Garden because Boucicault remodeled the theatre extensively, surprisingly cutting the auditorium in half and installing \"artificial tropical plants after a Parisian prototype.\" Boucicault effectively turned the theatre into a \"winter garden\" in the fall of the year. Among Boucicault's stable of first-rung actors were Joseph Jefferson, Agnes Robertson, and Mrs. John Wood. Boucicault's dramatization of Charles Dickens's Christmas story \"Cricket on the Hearth\" was his opening production, starring Jefferson as Caleb Plummer and Robertson as Dot; this immensely popular production eventually toured, as one critic has said, to \"every possible playhouse in English-speaking America.\"\n\nThat winter, on December 5 of 1859, Boucicault premiered one of his most popular - and controversial - melodramas \"The Octoroon\", subtitled \"Life in Louisiana\", which he had adapted from the novel \"The Quadroon\" by Thomas Mayne Reid. \"The Octoroon\", dealing with people of mixed white and African heritage, caused nothing short of a sensation, to see on the stage a drama that provoked discussions about race and politics. About this new phenomenon, \"The New York Times\" wrote that it had become \"the great dramatic \"sensation\" of the season\":\n\nThe newly named Winter Garden Theatre eventually became home to a series of musical extravaganzas and burlesques: \"Cinderella\" with music by Charles Koppitz and a text by Charles Dawson Shanley on September 9, 1861, \"The Wizard's Tempest\" by Charles Gayler, on June 9, 1862, and \"King Cotton\" by Charles Chamberlain on June 21, 1862.\n\nOn February 21, 1863, Edwin Booth took on the management of the Winter Garden Theatre (together with his brother-in-law, John Sleeper Clarke) with the intention of shifting the focus from musicals and burlesques to classical dramas. This enterprise included a toga-clad, one-night production of \"Julius Caesar\" on the evening of November 25, 1864, Evacuation Day, played by Edwin and his brothers, John Wilkes Booth and Junius Brutus Booth, Jr..\n\nThe goal of staging \"Julius Caesar\" for just one night was to raise funds for the establishment of a statue of William Shakespeare designed by John Quincy Adams Ward in the relatively new Central Park on the northern outskirts (then) of Manhattan. Tickets went for sale for a (then) astounding price of five dollars. Considering the way history was to unfold, it is curious that it was Edwin Booth who played the role of Brutus, assassin of Julius Caesar, and the role of Marc Antony was played by John Wilkes Booth, while \"lean and hungry\" Cassius was given to the heavier built Junius Brutus Booth, Jr..\n\nIn the handbill promoting the production (right), it stated that there would appear, for one night only, \"The Three Sons of the Great Booth.\" The three Booth brothers were then listed, from oldest to youngest, Junius, Edwin, and John, and beneath this, the Latin phrase that left no doubt that the entire production was dedicated to their father, the great tragedian Junius Brutus Booth: Filii Patri Digno Digniores.\nAs their mother watched on from a box on the aisle, the three Booth brothers reenacted the tragedy of \"Julius Caesar\" before an audience in The Winter Garden Theatre that was \"packed to the rafters.\" During the performance the clanging of fire bells could be heard from the streets of New York, as confederate sympathizers during the ongoing American Civil War tried to burn the city to the ground, which included fires set in the Lafarge House, which abutted the rear of The Winter Garden Theatre. About a half-hour into the performance, during the first scene of Act Two, when Brutus was pacing in his orchard, contemplating his pending assassination of Caesar, the clang and clatter of horse-drawn fire engines could be heard from the street outside. It seemed that there was a fire next door in the Lafarge House which threatened to engulf The Winter Garden Theatre. Before panic could consume the audience, Edwin stepped to the footlights to calm the audience.\n\nThe fire at the Lafarge House that almost spread to The Winter Garden Theatre had been set by sympathizers to the cause of the Confederacy with the intention of burning New York to the ground during these, the last months of the Civil War. At the Lafarge House, someone had set fires in the front parlor and had emptied a bottle of phosphorus on the furniture throughout a room on the third floor.\n\nIn describing this \"diabolical plot to burn the City of New York,\" which \"The New York Times\" called \"one of the most fiendish and inhuman acts known in modern times,\" it was reported under a banner heading:\n\nThe city was saved, as was The Winter Garden Theatre.\n\nThe production of \"Julius Caesar\" proceeded. The production was the first – and only – time that the three sons of one of America's great tragedians, Junius Brutus Booth, performed together on the same stage. The production raised $3,500 for the building of the statue of Shakespeare in Central Park, which stands there today.\n\nThe following night, on November 26, 1864, Booth played the lead role in what became known as the “100 nights \"Hamlet\"\", a record which stood for fifty-six years.\n\nThe \"Hamlet\" of Edwin Booth is well documented in reviews and diaries of those who saw the production. One review, appearing in \"Harper's\" shortly after the run of \"the hundred nights \"Hamlet\"\" summarized what Edwin Booth had accomplished during this important portrayal - a production which, perhaps more than any other single production in American stage history, solidified one of the great roles in dramatic history with a single actor. As a critic from the era then wrote: \"A really fine actor is as uncommon as a really great dramatic poet. Yet what Garrick was in Richard III or Edmund Kean in Shylock, we are sure Edwin Booth is in Hamlet.\"\n\nBooth followed his \"Hamlet\" marathon on March 23, 1865, with a series of what he called \"Grand Revivals\": a series of classical dramas sumptuously produced at the Winter Garden that began with a highly acclaimed production of \"Othello\", with Booth in the title role.\n\nFinally, in February 1866, after his return to the stage after a self-imposed retirement due to the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by his brother John, Booth played his acclaimed \"Richelieu\", followed in January 1867 by a spectacular production of \"Merchant of Venice\" that was considered one of the finest productions of that play during the 19th century.\n\nOn Saturday, March 23, 1867, a fire broke out under the stage which eventually burned the Winter Garden Theatre to the ground.\n\nRather than rebuild the theatre once again, Booth decided to erect his own theatre twenty blocks uptown on newly fashionable West Twenty-Third Street on the corner of Sixth Avenue, to be called Booth's Theatre.\n\nThe site was then occupied by the Grand Central Hotel, and is today the location for the New York University School of Law's Mercer Street Residence.\n\n"}
{"id": "25211701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25211701", "title": "Zsa Zsa Carter", "text": "Zsa Zsa Carter\n\nZsa Zsa Carter is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\" and its internet spin-off \"\", played by Emer Kenny. She made her first appearance in \"EastEnders\" on 5 January 2010 and appears in all twelve episodes of the first series of \"EastEnders: E20\". The character was created by a team of 13 writers aged between 17 and 22 and is described as bright, sarcastic and a rebel. In May 2010 the character's departure from the show was announced, and her last appearance was on 30 September 2010.\n\nZsa Zsa arrives in the show's setting of Albert Square, jumping the barriers at the tube station. She sees Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) selling T-shirts and makes up a story about her boyfriend dying in a car crash in order to distract Whitney so she can shoplift. She then heads to the café where she overhears Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan) breaking up with Peter Beale (Thomas Law), and she talks to Peter outside. Peter's sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield) decides to hold a party at 89b George Street, and Peter invites Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa asks Peter who lives there, and he says nobody does. They dance together and end up kissing. Lauren walks in and slaps Peter and Zsa Zsa, who fights with Lauren. Whitney intervenes, but ends up getting in the fight herself, and Zsa Zsa ends up with a cut on her forehead. When Lucy orders her out, Zsa Zsa throws punch over Lauren, Lucy and Whitney. Outside, she asks Peter if he knows Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), saying they go back a long way. Zsa Zsa visits Shirley and they talk. She is about to explain her reasons for being there when Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) comes in, and Shirley asks her to leave. Outside, Peter is waiting for Zsa Zsa. She goes to the bus stop and Peter wonders if he will see her again. She walks over to him and kisses him passionately, and says \"maybe\", taking his keys without him knowing.\n\nZsa Zsa's story continues in \"EastEnders: E20\", where she runs from her stepfather, (Steve North). He assumes she is in 89b George Street, where Shirley used to live, and dumps her bags outside. When he sees her, he runs after her but she is rescued by Leon Small (Sam Attwater). She runs off again and Leon, along with Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) and Mercy Olubunmi (Bunmi Mojekwu), finds her and she picks up her bags. Andy's car appears and they run into the flat with Peter's key. Andy leaves and they decide to stay in the flat. It is revealed that Zsa Zsa's father is dead and her mother Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White) has gone to Spain with a man named Miguel. She and Leon grow close, leading to them having sex in a cemetery. Fatboy tells Zsa Zsa that Leon is the father of Mercy's unborn baby, though it is untrue, and Zsa Zsa starts throwing everyone's belongings out of the window. Mercy suffers a miscarriage and Zsa Zsa freaks out and decides to leave. Leon stops her, saying he has feelings for her. He invites her to his boxing match, saying if she is there, he will know how she really feels. She turns up too late and misses the match, but when they meet up they kiss. Knowing they can no longer stay in the flat, Fatboy offers them a room at his house.\n\nSeveral weeks later, she runs away from Fatboy's house without warning, returning to Walford and spending the night at Shirley's flat. Leon and Fatboy track her down and she apologises for disappearing. Shirley decides to let her stay with her for a while, and attempts to get Zsa Zsa into a local school. This fails, so she asks Phil for a favour, and he speaks to the headmaster Mr Allcock (Bill Buckhurst). Shirley tells Zsa Zsa she has an appointment with Mr Allcock but she is not interested until she sees him and takes a liking to him. She befriends Whitney and gives her relationship advice. Mr Allcock visits and Zsa Zsa flirts with him, but she gets a place in the school due to Phil's intervention. Zsa Zsa receives a letter from her mother asking her to join her in Spain, but she does not want to go, so tries to prove she is useful by babysitting Shirley's housemate Heather Trott's (Cheryl Fergison) baby George and saying it is a shame after Shirley went to all the trouble to get her into school. Shirley acts like she does not care if Zsa Zsa stays or goes but after she tears up Tina's letter, she lets on to Heather that she would have missed Zsa Zsa.\n\nZsa Zsa and Leon start a proper relationship, and she starts working on Whitney's market stall. She starts receiving gifts from an unknown person, calling themselves \"The Blue Masquerader\". They eventually discover the gifts are from Peter. Lucy attempts to help Peter break up Leon and Zsa Zsa, but after he changes his mind, she reveals to Zsa Zsa that Leon got her pregnant, causing Zsa Zsa to end the relationship. After a while, Fatboy attempts to reunite the couple as Leon has not been himself since. The couple nearly reunite, until Leon kisses Whitney without permission. Zsa Zsa travels to Hampshire with Leon, Fatboy, Lucy and Whitney and plans with Lucy to get revenge on Leon, though the plan fails when Lucy tells Leon about it and he runs off into the woods. The next day Leon is missing and she does not believe Lucy when she says Leon went out early because he left his wallet behind. She demands to know why Lucy lied so Lucy leaves. They search for Leon and find his mobile phone with blood on it, leading them to believe that Peter hit him with Fatboy's van the night before. However, he turns up having been in police custody overnight. Upon their return to Walford, Leon attempts to make amends with Zsa Zsa but she says she preferred it when she thought he was dead.\n\nZsa Zsa and her friends uncover the body of Owen Turner (Lee Ross) in Albert Square's gardens, and are horrified. The next day, Zsa Zsa makes a joke when Leon speaks after saying nothing all day, and he leaves. She finds him and apologises, and comforts him as she did not realise how badly he was affected. He then tells her about when his mother died in a car crash. Phil ejects Zsa Zsa and Shirley from their home, incorrectly claiming that Shirley has conspired with his mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) against him, leaving them homeless. They move in with Heather, but the landlord fails to make mortgage payments, meaning bailiffs turn up to take the house. They agree to squat but Shirley leaves the house, meaning they cannot return there. Zsa Zsa tells Shirley she is useless and would rather live in the gutter. She then asks Mercy if she can stay with her, and starts working in the café. Zsa Zsa later accidentally reveals that Lucy's miscarriage was actually an abortion to Jane, when she misunderstands Jane being upset over Lucy being dishonest about cheating to gain her grades.\n\nLeon obtains two tickets to a music festival in France and chooses to take Zsa Zsa with him. However, Zsa Zsa finds out from Mercy that Leon slept with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber). She lies to him that she slept with someone else a few months ago to see if he will confess, but he says he has not been with anyone else. Later, she seduces him in Fatboy's van but throws him out in his underwear, humiliating him. She says goodbye to Shirley and leaves Walford for France in the van.\n\nZsa Zsa also appears in extra content on the official \"EastEnders: E20\" website. The first is a video of her writing a text message to her mother, in which she says goodbye and that she is sick of trying to mend their relationship. However, she saves the message without sending it. Another video shows Leon filming Zsa Zsa as they mess around with their camera phones, ending with a kiss. Zsa Zsa also makes a cameo appearance in series 2 of \"EastEnders: E20\". In the first episode, she insults Naz Mehmet (Emaa Hussen), who insults her back, before stealing some of Fatboy's money and running away.\n\nBlue-haired Zsa Zsa is one of four characters created for \"EastEnders: E20\" who also appear in \"EastEnders\". Kenny's casting was announced on 25 November 2009. Zsa Zsa, along with the other characters from \"E20\", was created by the show's 13 writers during a summer school run by the BBC in August 2009. Open auditions for the cast were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East but producers had trouble casting Zsa Zsa, having spent two months looking. Kenny was cast in the role whilst writing the second episode of \"E20\". She received a phone call from her agent who told her about a character called Zsa Zsa and Kenny replied that she already knew the character well. She attended an audition and was offered the part the next day, three days before filming started. One of the executive producers of \"EastEnders: E20\", John Yorke, said \"She was so good that we suddenly went 'It's her!'\" Kenny was said to be thrilled to be given the opportunity to write and act for \"EastEnders\", describing the programme as \"iconic\" and adding that her part in the spin-off was exciting as it was connecting with viewers who use computers more than they watch television. To prepare for the role, Kenny had to disguise her accent, saying that Zsa Zsa's voice is \"harder\" than her own, which she called \"posh\". Director Michael Keillor advised her to spend a weekend in the East End of London, listening to different accents. The \"EastEnders\" website branded Zsa Zsa a \"Beautiful, funky and outspoken tomboy\".\n\nKenny told magazine \"Inside Soap\" that she found her first day on set intimidating because she had an argument scene with Henry, but said that she helped her feel \"at ease.\" Along with her co-stars Sam Attwater (Leon Small) and Ricky Norwood (Fatboy), Kenny's initial contract was extended to six months, and in May 2010, along with Attwater, it was announced that she would be written out of the show, expressing a wish to pursue further acting roles. The new executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said \"Emer and Sam have made a real impact in the short time they've been on the Square and we wish them all the best for the future.\" Her final appearance was in the episode broadcast on 30 September 2010.\n\nFollowing Kenny's departure, the door has been left open for her return. Kenny commented: \"All I can say is it's a very Zsa Zsa ending and it suits the character. The door is open, which is very nice - I'd absolutely consider going back. It was really emotional. It's just like leaving behind a massive family. I really miss it - but onwards and upwards\". Kenny also discussed writing the second series of EastEnders: E20, saying: \"I really wanted it to start with a bang. As soon as you come in it's exciting, there's sex and romance and kissing. I wanted it to be really fresh\".\n\nAlthough it was not planned, Zsa Zsa was given a personality similar to that of her on-screen aunt, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), an established character in \"EastEnders\". During the development of the character, she changed a lot and was fluid until filming started, when Kenny had a full day on set with Henry. She explained: \"The words were there and I knew what she was like but when I saw Linda [Henry] speak and when I engaged with her, I realised that it was like looking in a mirror.\" When the character was announced, she was described as beautiful, funky, an outspoken tomboy, very bright, but likes to think she does not need anybody's help. Kenny said of the character in an interview with \"Soaplife\" magazine: \"Zsa Zsa doesn't like authority or anyone who messes with her. She's a lone wolf and doesn't care about anyone.\" She told entertainment website Digital Spy that Zsa Zsa is \"a real bitch\" and \"very mean and cold\", while a profile for the character on the official \"EastEnders\" website says she is sarcastic, a rebel and \"desperately wants the security that comes with a family but is terrified of being dependent on anyone. Her experience has taught her that adults let you down.\"\n\nKenny predicted two weeks after her first appearance on \"EastEnders\" that her on-screen mother may make an appearance in the future. Kenny replied: \"Not yet, but there's definitely the possibility in the future. I'm sure she'll be in soon\". Kenny also stated that her character is to be heavily involved with her on-screen aunt Shirley. She added: \"The pair recognise their similarities and that brings a warmth to their relationship. At first, though, they really clash and Heather thinks that Zsa Zsa's complete trouble - which she is! Elsewhere on the Square, there's a lot of story between the other young people on the Square. Zsa Zsa definitely gets stuck in\". Kenny also said about Zsa Zsa's second side: \"It's quite interesting because I know when Zsa Zsa comes in, people will just hate her because she's a real bitch. That's quite intimidating because there are so many good bitches on the show - Janine being the queen of them all. Zsa Zsa's a little different in the way she looks and talks, though. So we've definitely tried to make her different\".\n\nDuring her stint on \"EastEnders: E20\", Zsa Zsa was called an \"impressive\" character by Tony Stewart of the \"Daily Mirror\". A writer for \"The Northern Echo\" wondered if Zsa Zsa, along with Leon and Fatboy, brought a new injection of life into \"EastEnders\" or took away screen time from more established characters, Zsa Zsa was featured in \"Inside Soap\" \"Next Big Thing\" feature in 2010, where they name the new stars of British soaps that they believe \"will set the world of soap alight in the year ahead\" but after her departure they branded her one of 2010's departed characters that would not be remembered. In May 2010, Kenny received a nomination in the \"Best Soap Newcomer\" category at the 14th TVChoice Awards for her portrayal of Zsa Zsa.\n\n\n"}
