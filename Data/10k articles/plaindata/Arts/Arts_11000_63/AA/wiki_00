It was set and filmed in Bangalore. The story concerns the travails of 22-year-old nurse Tessa (Rima Kallingal) from Kottayam who was raped and who takes revenge on her tormentors.\n\nIt released on 13 April 2012, and received positive reviews from critics. It was also well received at the box-office. Rima Kallingal won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Actress for the film.\n\nTessa (Rima Kallingal) is a nursing student in Bangalore with plans of traveling to Canada for a career. She meets Cyril (Fahadh Faasil) from the travel consultancy agency working towards setting up her visa. They soon fall in love and start living together. Tessa loves him with all her heart and takes their relationship and living together seriously.\n\nOne day while at a pub, a guy misbehaves with Tessa and Cyril beats him up badly. The guy tries to take revenge on Cyril and searches for him. Cyril goes into hiding with the help of his boss Hegde (Prathap Pothen). Hegde arrives at Cyril's home to inform Tessa about the situation. Then he asks her plainly \"Can I have sex with you?\" A shocked Tessa is then brutally attacked and raped. When Cyril finds out what happened, he becomes violent and wants to kill Hegde. Tessa calms him down saying that she does not want to make the incident worse than it is; she instead wants to get to Canada at the earliest. Once Tessa recovers from her injuries, Hegde visits her again to ask for forgiveness. He comes while Cyril is not around and rapes her for a second time. Tessa decides not to travel abroad and plans to murder Hegde.\n\nCyril discusses the situation with his boss who suggests killing Tessa and appoints Cyril to do it. Cyril traps her by putting some drugs in her bag. The police arrest Tessa and she is imprisoned. While Tessa calls out for help, she finds Cyril simply walking away from her, which is when she realises Cyril set her up. Cyril relocates to Cochin and runs a modeling agency. While in prison Tessa meets Zubeida (Rashmi Sathish) who is sentenced for murder. Through Zubeida's criminal world connections Tessa realizes that Cyril, is a known pimp and was cheating her along with the support of his boss Hegde. Zubeida and Tessa bond well with each other, and Zubeida moulds a criminal mindset within her for the strength and courage needed to strike back at Cyril and Hegde.\n\nWhen the court sets her free, Tessa with the help of DK (Sathaar) kills Hegde by poisoning him with a cobra. Next, she arrives in Cochin as a femme fatale in search of Cyril while pretending to be a model. Later one night Tessa hooks up with Cyril in his studio. Cyril who had recognized her earlier reveals it and angrily berates her. He beats her and abuses her by calling her a \"slut who does any 'adjustment' to flourish her career\" for stopping her further being a menace to him. But his frustration dissolves slowly as he wants to enjoy her company. She reminds him she is a mere woman.\n\nBut at night Tessa executes her revenge plan and sedates Cyril and sadistically penectomises him. When he regains consciousness she tells him that she has removed his male organ through a medical surgery. While Cyril finds himself in intense pain and bound to his bed, she taunts him to make him realize his faults and the gross wrongs he committed to her and rationalizes her crime. But he doesn't yield to her taunts and reveals a back-story concerning his mother and that his life as a pimp is not entirely his fault.\n\nTessa tells Cyril that she knows that she is still somewhere in his heart. She reminds him that she has only lost someone who cheated on her, whereas he lost someone who genuinely loved him. Now Cyril is stunned that he is not even able to face Tessa. Cyril recollects that her love was true and his love was overshadowed by his male supremacy concept and greed for wealth. Over the days he admits his actions that caused her pain. Then Tessa leaves him but not before inviting him to settle the score with her, if any remains there. Cyril accepts the challenge of a true criminal as he is and taunts her that he will confront her when he is ready, most probably knowing that he has to settle the score with her in terms of true love with roots in violence. Tessa leaves for Canada, dismantles her cell phone, and cuts further contact with DK.\n\n\nThe score and background music is composed by Bijibal and Rex Vijayan.\nAshik says that the concept of the film was there in his mind since many years. \"This concept was there in my mind when I was working on my maiden venture, \"Daddy Cool\". It stayed in my mind and I wanted to take it up at some point. I got the confidence to go ahead with the subject after the success of \"Salt N' Pepper\". This one is not the usual kind of storyline that will appeal to all producers. There is a certain amount of risk in it.\" After the success of \"Salt N' Pepper\", Ashik announced his next film \"Idukki Gold\". During the pre-production, Abu put the project on hold and started the work of \"22 Female Kottayam\". The film was scripted by debutant writer Abhilash Kumar (who is the husband of actress Lena) along with Shyam Pushkaran of \"Salt N' Pepper\" fame. Kumar had worked with Ashik in \"Daddy Cool\" and \"Salt 'N Pepper\" as an assistant director. Kumar says the story is loosely based on real-life stories about young women who move out of Kerala to Hyderabad, Orissa and Bangalore in search of nursing jobs to eventually go abroad. The production controller of \"22 Female Kottayam\" is Shibu G Suseelan.\n\n\"22FK\" started production in December 2011 and was mostly filmed from Bangalore. Shyju Khalid wielded the camera. He says that the film, which was shot on a multi-camera, was a big challenge for him. \"It is a thriller-cum-romance movie. In the first half, there is romance and suddenly a rape scene, so I had to add a lot of grays to give that effect. And, the climax was the most challenging part, as it’s very dramatic and I had to add the proper effect to retain the mood. Here, the subject was a little dark so I could experiment, but in normal movies you can’t do much of an experiment. Also, you have to keep in mind the taste of Malayalis,\" says Khalid.\n\n\"22 Female Kottayam\" received positive critical response upon its release.\n\n\"The Times of India\" rated it 3 out of 5 stars, concluding that \"The film has a theme as old as the Kannaki myth but comes nowhere near in terms of inspiration.\" One India commented that \"22 Female Kottayam is like a fresh whiff of breeze\" and concluded the review by adding, \"Cheers for director Ashik for experimenting with such a novel and path breaking plot.\" Rediff also rated the film 3 out of 5 star praising the direction of Ashik by saying \"Ashik adds a distinct style to his direction with 22 Female Kottayam.\" Sify rated it as good and said that \"22 Female Kottayam may be far from perfect, but it is a movie in the right direction. Such efforts should be well appreciated, as it is a step that leads to better cinema.\" NowRunning rated the film 3/5 and said \"Big hugs, Mr. Abu for gifting us with this fighter female, 22 years old, from Kottayam. And an extra big hug for not parading her as a virgin.\" Metro Matinee rated film as \"Excellent\" and said \"Ashik's 22FK is a refreshing theme with superb execution.\"\n\n\"22 FK\" is one of the low budget hits of 2012. The film made at a budget of 2.5 crore grossed 5.2 crore at the box office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film was remade into Tamil and Telugu simultaneously as \"Malini 22 Palayamkottai\" and \"Malini 22 Vijayawada\", with Nithya Menen and Krish J. Sathaar playing the lead roles.\n\n"}
{"id": "21504235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21504235", "title": "Actor", "text": "Actor\n\nAn actor is a person who portrays a character in a performance (also actress; see below). The actor performs \"in the flesh\" in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is (), literally \"one who answers\". The actor's interpretation of their role—the art of acting—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \"playing themselves\", as in some forms of experimental performance art.\n\nFormerly, in ancient Greece and Rome, the medieval world, and the time of William Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys. After the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men.\n\nAfter 1660 in England, when women first started to appear on stage, the terms \"actor\" or \"actress\" were initially used interchangeably for female performers, but later, influenced by the French , \"actress\" became the commonly used term for women in theater and film. The etymology is a simple derivation from \"actor\" with added. When referring to groups of performers of both sexes, \"actors\" is preferred. \"Actor\" is also used before the full name of a performer as a gender-specific term.\n\nWithin the profession, the re-adoption of the neutral term dates to the post-war period of the 1950 and '60s, when the contributions of women to cultural life in general were being reviewed. When \"The Observer\" and \"The Guardian\" published their new joint style guide in 2010, it stated \"Use ['actor'] for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in name of award, e.g. Oscar for best actress.\" The guide's authors stated that \"actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, 'lady doctor', 'male nurse' and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men).\" (See \"male as norm\"). \"As Whoopi Goldberg put it in an interview with the paper: 'An actress can only play a woman. I'm an actor – I can play anything. The UK performers' union Equity has no policy on the use of \"actor\" or \"actress\". An Equity spokesperson said that the union does not believe that there is a consensus on the matter and stated that the \"...subject divides the profession\". In 2009, the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated that \"Actress\" remains the common term used in major acting awards given to female recipients (e.g., Academy Award for Best Actress).\n\nWith regard to the cinema of the United States, the gender-neutral term \"player\" was common in film in the silent film era and the early days of the Motion Picture Production Code, but in the 2000s in a film context, it is generally deemed archaic. However, \"player\" remains in use in the theatre, often incorporated into the name of a theatre group or company, such as the American Players, the East West Players, etc. Also, actors in improvisational theatre may be referred to as \"players\".\n\nIn 2015, \"Forbes\" reported that \"...just 21 of the 100 top-grossing films of 2014 featured a female lead or co-lead, while only 28.1% of characters in 100 top-grossing films were female...\". \"In the U.S., there is an \"industry-wide [gap] in salaries of all scales. On average, white women get paid 78 cents to every dollar a white man makes, while Hispanic women earn 56 cents to a white male’s dollar, Black women 64 cents and Native American women just 59 cents to that.\" \"Forbes\"' analysis of US acting salaries in 2013 determined that the \"...men on Forbes’ list of top-paid actors for that year made 2 times as much money as the top-paid actresses. That means that Hollywood's best-compensated actresses made just 40 cents for every dollar that the best-compensated men made.\"\n\nThe first recorded case of a performing actor occurred in 534 BC (though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the Greek performer Thespis stepped onto the stage at the \"Theatre Dionysus\" to become the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story. Prior to Thespis' act, Grecian stories were only expressed in song, dance, and in third person narrative. In honor of Thespis, actors are commonly called \"Thespians\". The exclusively male actors in the theatre of ancient Greece performed in three types of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play. Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the Romans. The theatre of ancient Rome was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of situation comedies, to high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies.\n\nAs the Western Roman Empire fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power shifted to Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire. Records show that mime, pantomime, scenes or recitations from tragedies and comedies, dances, and other entertainments were very popular. From the 5th century, Western Europe was plunged into a period of general disorder. Small nomadic bands of actors traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience; there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes. Traditionally, actors were not of high status; therefore, in the Early Middle Ages, traveling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust. Early Middle Ages actors were denounced by the Church during the Dark Ages, as they were viewed as dangerous, immoral, and pagan. In many parts of Europe, traditional beliefs of the region and time period meant actors could not receive a Christian burial.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, churches in Europe began staging dramatized versions of biblical events. By the middle of the 11th century, liturgical drama had spread from Russia to Scandinavia to Italy. The Feast of Fools encouraged the development of comedy. In the Late Middle Ages, plays were produced in 127 towns. These vernacular Mystery plays often contained comedy, with actors playing devils, villains, and clowns. The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. Amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers.\n\nThere were a number of secular plays staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is \"The Play of the Greenwood\" by Adam de la Halle in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and folk material such as faeries and other supernatural occurrences. Farces also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. At the end of the Late Middle Ages, professional actors began to appear in England and Europe. Richard III and Henry VII both maintained small companies of professional actors. Beginning in the mid-16th century, Commedia dell'arte troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries. Commedia dell'arte was an actor-centred theatre, requiring little scenery and very few props. Plays were loose frameworks that provided situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors improvised. The plays utilised stock characters. A troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members. Most actors were paid a share of the play's profits roughly equivalent to the sizes of their roles.\n\nRenaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions, such as the mystery plays, \"morality plays\", and the \"university drama\" that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy. The Italian tradition of Commedia dell'arte, as well as the elaborate masques frequently presented at court, also contributed to the shaping of public theatre. Since before the reign of Elizabeth I, companies of players were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations. These became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the Elizabethan stage.\n\nThe development of the theatre and opportunities for acting ceased when Puritan opposition to the stage banned the performance of all plays within London. Puritans viewed the theatre as immoral. The re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of English drama. English comedies written and performed in the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called \"Restoration comedy\". Restoration comedy is notorious for its sexual explicitness. At this point, women were allowed for the first time to appear on the English stage, exclusively in female roles. This period saw the introduction of the first professional actresses and the rise of the first celebrity actors.\n\nIn the 19th century, the negative reputation of actors was largely reversed, and acting became an honored, popular profession and art. The rise of the actor as celebrity provided the transition, as audiences flocked to their favorite \"stars\". A new role emerged for the actor-managers, who formed their own companies and controlled the actors, the productions, and the financing. When successful, they built up a permanent clientele that flocked to their productions. They could enlarge their audience by going on tour across the country, performing a repertoire of well-known plays, such as those by Shakespeare. The newspapers, private clubs, pubs, and coffee shops rang with lively debates evaluating the relative merits of the stars and the productions. Henry Irving (1838-1905) was the most successful of the British actor-managers. Irving was renowned for his Shakespearean roles, and for such innovations as turning out the house lights so that attention could focus more on the stage and less on the audience. His company toured across Britain, as well as Europe and the United States, demonstrating the power of star actors and celebrated roles to attract enthusiastic audiences. His knighthood in 1895 indicated full acceptance into the higher circles of British society.\n\nBy the early 20th century, the economics of large-scale productions displaced the actor-manager model. It was too hard to find people who combined a genius at acting as well as management, so specialization divided the roles as stage managers and later theatre directors emerged. Financially, much larger capital was required to operate out of a major city. The solution was corporate ownership of chains of theatres, such as by the Theatrical Syndicate, Edward Laurillard, and especially The Shubert Organization. By catering to tourists, theaters in large cities increasingly favored long runs of highly popular plays, especially musicals. Big name stars became even more essential.\n\n\nFormerly, in some societies, only men could become actors. In ancient Greece and ancient Rome and the medieval world, it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on stage; this belief persisted until the 17th century in Venice. In the time of William Shakespeare, women's roles were generally played by men or boys.\n\nWhen an eighteen-year Puritan prohibition of drama was lifted after the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. Margaret Hughes is oft credited as the first professional actress on the English stage. This prohibition ended during the reign of Charles II in part because he enjoyed watching actresses on stage. Specifically, Charles II issued letters patent to Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant, granting them the monopoly right to form two London theatre companies to perform \"serious\" drama, and the letters patent were reissued in 1662 with revisions allowing actresses to perform for the first time.\n\nThe first occurrence of the term \"actress\" was in 1608 according to the OED and is ascribed to Middleton. In the 19th century many viewed women in acting negatively, as actresses were often courtesans and associated with promiscuity. Despite these prejudices, the 19th century also saw the first female acting \"stars\", most notably Sarah Bernhardt.\n\nIn Japan, \"onnagata\", men taking on female roles, were used in \"kabuki\" theatre when women were banned from performing on stage during the Edo period. This convention continues. By contrast, some forms of Chinese drama involve women playing all roles.\n\nIn modern times, women occasionally played the roles of boys or young men. For example, the stage role of Peter Pan is traditionally played by a woman, as are most principal boys in British pantomime. Opera has several \"breeches roles\" traditionally sung by women, usually mezzo-sopranos. Examples are Hansel in \"Hänsel und Gretel\", Cherubino in \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and Octavian in \"Der Rosenkavalier\".\n\nWomen playing male roles are uncommon in film, with notable exceptions. In 1982, Stina Ekblad played the mysterious Ismael Retzinsky in \"Fanny and Alexander\", and Linda Hunt received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing Billy Kwan in \"The Year of Living Dangerously\". In 2007, Cate Blanchett was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing Jude Quinn, a fictionalized representation of Bob Dylan in the 1960s, in \"I'm Not There\".\n\nIn the 2000s, women playing men in live theatre is particularly common in presentations of older plays, such as Shakespearean works with large numbers of male characters in roles where gender is inconsequential.\n\nHaving an actor dress as the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long-standing tradition in comic theatre and film. Most of Shakespeare's comedies include instances of overt cross-dressing, such as Francis Flute in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". The movie \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" stars Jack Gilford dressing as a young bride. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the Billy Wilder film \"Some Like It Hot\". Cross-dressing for comic effect was a frequently used device in most of the Carry On films. Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams have each appeared in a hit comedy film (\"Tootsie\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire\", respectively) in which they played most scenes dressed as a woman.\n\nOccasionally, the issue is further complicated, for example, by a woman playing a woman acting as a man—who then pretends to be a woman, such as Julie Andrews in \"Victor/Victoria\", or Gwyneth Paltrow in \"Shakespeare in Love\". In \"\", filmwatchers never learn the gender of the androgynous main characters Pat and Chris (played by Julia Sweeney and Dave Foley). Similarly, in the aforementioned example of The Marriage of Figaro, there is a scene in which Cherubino (a male character portrayed by a woman) dresses up and acts as a woman; the other characters in the scene are aware of a single level of gender role obfuscation, while the audience is aware of two levels.\n\nA few modern roles are played by a member of the opposite sex in order to emphasize the gender fluidity of the role. Edna Turnblad in \"Hairspray\" was played by Divine in the 1988 original film, Harvey Fierstein in the Broadway musical, and John Travolta in the 2007 movie musical. Felicity Huffman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for playing Bree Osbourne (a male-to-female transsexual) in 2005's \"Transamerica\".\n\nActors working in theatre, film, television and radio have to learn specific skills. Techniques that work well in one type of acting may not work well in another type of acting.\n\nTo act on stage, actors need to learn the stage directions that appear in the script, such as \"Stage Left\" and \"Stage Right\". These directions are based on the actor's point of view as he or she stands on the stage facing the audience. Actors also have to learn the meaning of the stage directions \"Upstage\" (away from the audience) and \"Downstage\" (towards the audience) Theatre actors need to learn blocking, which is \"...where and how an actor moves on the stage during a play\". Most scripts specify some blocking. The Director also gives instructions on blocking, such as crossing the stage or picking up and using a prop.\n\nSome theater actors need to learn stage combat, which is simulated fighting on stage. Actors may have to simulate hand-to-hand [fighting] or sword[-fighting]. Actors are coached by fight directors, who help them learn the choreographed sequence of fight actions.\nFrom 1894 to the late 1920s, movies were silent films. Silent film actors emphasized body language and facial expression, so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen. Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern-day audiences as simplistic or campy. The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience. Vaudeville theatre was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors. The pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director Marshall Neilan in 1917: \"The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures.\" In other cases, directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis. As early as 1914, American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen.\n\nPioneering film directors in Europe and the United States recognized the different limitations and freedoms of the mediums of stage and screen by the early 1910s. Silent films became less vaudevillian in the mid 1910s, as the differences between stage and screen became apparent. Due to the work of directors such as D W Griffith, cinematography became less stage-like, and the then-revolutionary close up shot allowed subtle and naturalistic acting. In America, D.W. Griffith's company Biograph Studios, became known for its innovative direction and acting, conducted suit the cinema rather than the stage. Griffith realized that theatrical acting did not look good on film and required his actors and actresses to go through weeks of film acting training.\n\nLillian Gish has been called film's \"first true actress\" for her work in the period, as she pioneered new film performing techniques, recognizing the crucial differences between stage and screen acting. Directors such as Albert Capellani and Maurice Tourneur began to insist on naturalism in their films. By the mid-1920s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style, though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic, low-key acting straight away; as late as 1927, films featuring expressionistic acting styles, such as \"Metropolis\", were still being released. \n\nAccording to Anton Kaes, a silent film scholar from the University of Wisconsin, American silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between 1913 and 1921, influenced by techniques found in German silent film. This is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the Weimar Republic, \"including film directors, producers, cameramen, lighting and stage technicians, as well as actors and actresses\".\n\nFilm actors have to learn to get used to and be comfortable with a camera being in front of them.\nFilm actors need to learn to find and stay on their \"mark.\" This is a position on the floor marked with tape. This position is where the lights and camera focus are optimized. Film actors also need to learn how to prepare well and perform well on screen tests. Screen tests are a filmed audition of part of the script.\n\nUnlike theater actors, who develop characters for repeat performances, film actors lack continuity, forcing them to come to all scenes (sometimes shot in reverse of the order in which they ultimately appear) with a fully developed character already.\n\n\"Since film captures even the smallest gesture and magnifies it..., cinema demands a less flamboyant and stylized bodily performance from the actor than does the theater.\" \"The performance of emotion is the most difficult aspect of film acting to master: ...the film actor must rely on subtle facial ticks, quivers, and tiny lifts of the eyebrow to create a believable character.\" Some theatre stars \"...have made the theater-to-cinema transition quite successfully (Laurence Olivier, Glenn Close, and Julie Andrews, for instance), others have not...\"\n\n\"On a television set, there are typically several cameras angled at the set. Actors who are new to on-screen acting can get confused about which camera to look into.\" TV actors need to learn to use lav mics (Lavaliere microphones). TV actors need to understand the concept of \"frame\". \"The term frame refers to the area that the camera's lens is capturing.\"\nWithin the acting industry, there are four types of television roles one could land on a show. Each type varies in prominence, frequency of appearance, and pay. The first is known as a \"series regular\"—the main actors on the show as part of the permanent cast. Actors in \"recurring\" roles are under contract to appear in multiple episodes of a series. A \"co-star\" role is a small speaking role that usually only appears in one episode. A \"guest star\" is a larger role than a \"co-star\" role, and the character is often the central focus of the episode or integral to the plot.\n\nRadio drama is a dramatized, purely acoustic performance, broadcast on radio or published on audio media, such as tape or CD. With no visual component, radio drama depends on dialogue, music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story: \"It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension.\"\n\nRadio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s. By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment. With the advent of television in the 1950s, however, radio drama lost some of its popularity, and in some countries has never regained large audiences. However, recordings of OTR (old-time radio) survive today in the audio archives of collectors and museums, as well as several online sites such as Internet Archive.\n\n, radio drama has a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States. Much of American radio drama is restricted to rebroadcasts or podcasts of programs from previous decades. However, other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama. In the United Kingdom, for example, the BBC produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on Radio 3, Radio 4, and Radio 4 Extra. Podcasting has also offered the means of creating new radio dramas, in addition to the distribution of vintage programs.\n\nThe terms \"audio drama\" or \"audio theatre\" are sometimes used synonymously with \"radio drama\" with one possible distinction: audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio. Audio drama, whether newly produced or OTR classics, can be found on CDs, cassette tapes, podcasts, webcasts and conventional broadcast radio.\n\nThanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution, radio drama is experiencing a revival.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50409779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50409779", "title": "Apocalypse of Lorvão", "text": "Apocalypse of Lorvão\n\nThe Apocalypse of Lorvão is an illuminated manuscript from Lorvão, Portugal containing the \"Commentary on the Apocalypse\" of Beatus of Liébana Monastery, Spain. \n\nIt is currently kept at the Torre do Tombo National Archive in Lisbon. \n\nThis is a well-dated manuscript whose origin is identified through its colophon, which indicates that it was completed in 1189 in the scriptorium of the Lorvão monastery in the present municipality of Penacova, near Coimbra. It was signed by the scribe Egeas, who might also be the author of illustrations. It remained preserved in the abbey until the nineteenth century, including while the monastery changed denomination in 1205 and hosted a Cistercian community. \n\nThe historian Alexandre Herculano discovered the manuscript in the library of the monastery in 1853 and transferred it to the national archives of Portugal in Lisbon to be part of the corpus of documents and texts in the history of Portugal (\"Portugalliae Monumenta Historica\"). The manuscript is still preserved there.\n\nIt is one of eleven manuscripts of Beatus in the Iberian record of the Memory of the World Register by UNESCO in 2015.\n\nThis is the only manuscript of the Beatus Commentary on the Apocalypse of Liébana, also called Beatus, produced in Portugal during the Middle Ages. This is a relatively primitive version of the text, probably copied from a ninth century original. It is written in a Carolingian minuscule style that made the transition to the Gothic. His miniatures are at number 70, including 18 full-page, 20 of the half-page and the other smaller and variable dimensions. The manuscript also retains its original binding.These illustrations were considered archaic for the time, marked by a thick stroke and colors dominated by orange and yellow. They may have been copied from an older model, perhaps close to the original manuscript written by Beatus of Liebana. There are also repeatedly scenes of everyday life at the time of Sancho I of Portugal. Finally, Beatus map belonging to the manuscript has been preserved but only half of it.

{"id": "6661602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6661602", "title": "Autun Cathedral", "text": "Autun Cathedral\n\nThe Cathedral of Saint Lazarus of Autun (), commonly known as Autun Cathedral, is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Autun and a national monument of France. Famous for its Cluniac inspiration and its Romanesque sculptures by Gislebertus it is a highlight in Romanesque art in Burgundy and it is the seat of the Bishop of Autun. The Bishop of Autun set forth the construction of St. Lazarus Cathedral as a result of the large movement of pilgrims travelling to Vezelay as they progressed on the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela.\n\nDue to social practices that involved pilgrims venerating the relics of saints in this period, the Bishop of Autun ordered the creation of a larger cathedral to house the relics and accommodate the influx of pilgrims into Autun. The column capitals and main façade of the church are embellished with realistic sculptures carved by Gislebertus. The artwork is a means of teaching the masses of Christian ethics with dramatic scenes of heaven and hell. Other features include a rare tympanum signed by Giselbertus of Autun. \n\nThe Autun Cathedral is a magnificent display of Romanesque Art and Architecture. The sculptures created by Gislebertus successfully integrate biblical iconography relating to the new and old testament's with ease and amazing artistic ability. The size and quality of the tympanum of the Last Judgment, and the lintel of the Temptation of Eve are impressive and exquisitely detailed pieces of art. The Autun Cathedral remains on the highest elevation in Autun, France and is considered a fine example of the French Romanesque.\n\nThe first cathedral of Autun was built from the 5th century onwards (later dedicated to Saint Nazarius (St. Nazaire), as it held relics of Saints Nazarius and Celsus) and was several times refurbished and enlarged. In about 970 it obtained from Marseille some of the relics of Lazarus of Aix, in the belief that they were relics of Lazarus of Bethany, the friend of Jesus. These became an object of pilgrimage and the crowds became too great for the cathedral building. The Bishop of Autun, Etienne de Bâgé, therefore decided in about 1120 on the construction of a new cathedral as a pilgrimage church and for the better veneration of the relics. The new cathedral was allotted a site to the north of the earlier cathedral of Saint Nazaire, of which some remains may still be seen.\n\nWork on the new cathedral of Saint Lazarus (St. Lazare) began in around 1120 and advanced rapidly enough for the building to be consecrated in 1132. It was mostly finished by 1146, when the relics of Lazarus were translated from the old cathedral. The Tomb of Lazarus, the shrine of the relics, was constructed in the choir in 1170-1180. The narthex or portico was not completed until the very end of the century.\n\nSt. Lazare Cathedral stands in the highest and best fortified corner of the town, and through external modifications that have been applied to the building the appearance has been much altered by the addition of a Gothic tower, a spire and side chapels in the 15th century. The cathedral still contains a highly Romanesque appearance on the interior. In 1462, Bishop Jean Rolin had a new belfry built in replacement of the Romanesque one that was unfortunately destroyed by a bolt of lightning.\n\nThe inspiration of the new building, both in layout and decoration, was Cluniac. The designs were the work of the bishop Etienne de Bâgé, who was particularly influenced by the Cluniac abbey of Paray-le-Monial. St. Lazare Cathedral was consecrated in 1132.\n\nFor a number of years after 1146 the two cathedrals operated in tandem, with Saint Lazare as the summer cathedral (from Easter to All Saints' Day) and Saint Nazaire as the winter cathedral. The cathedral was finished in 1146, (with the exception of the porch which was added a few years later); Abbé Grivot writing in his excellent guide to the cathedral explains that the interior of the building is not Gothic, as there are no crossed diagonal ribs, but Roman vaulting as was used at Cluny III. Saint Lazare was eventually confirmed as the one cathedral of Autun in 1195. From 1793 until 1805 it was home to the famous painting \"Madonna of Chancellor Rolin\" by Jan van Eyck, now in the Musée du Louvre.\n\nThe interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by massive columns with longitudinal carvings punctuated with beautifully decorated Romanesque capitals. The plan of the cathedral has a narthex of two bays topped by two towers, followed by a 7-bay nave flanked by side aisles and a transept with the tower surmounting cross. The twin flanking towers date from the 19th century.\n\nThe nave elevation is composed of three levels: grand arcade, triforium and clerestory, each marked by a cornice. The three story elevation of St. Lazare was made possible by the use of pointed arches for the nave. Each nave bay is separated at the vault by a transverse rib. Each transept projects to the width of two nave bays and the west entrance has a narthex which screens the main portal. The triforium base is decorated with a frieze of rosettes and consists of three blind arches.\n\nThe pointed arch has been debated to be adapted from Islamic Art architecture where it had been used for some time. Many of the historiated capitals that adorn the columns within St Lazare were carved by Gislebertus that include fine representations of the \"Flight into Egypt\" and \"Adoration of the Magi. The capitals adorn columns along the nave. What makes St. Lazare a masterpiece of Romanesque art is the quality of Gislebertus' sculpture that appears on dozens of capitals in the nave and chancel including scenes from the Bible carved in stone in a very particular style.\n\nThe Cathedral of St. Lazare has a ground-plan in the form of a Latin cross, with an aisled nave, a plain transept and a three-stage choir with a semicircular end. The Gothic spire dates from the 15th century although the west towers were rebuilt in the 19th century, based on the Romanesque style of Paray-le-Monial.\n\nSt. Lazare Cathedral contains some of the most spectacular Romanesque capitals done by Gislebertus in its nave and choir. Gislebertus created capitals that used the tendrils of the actual Corinthian capital to create an architectural frame for the narrative of the story to develop. \nThe capitals of the portal are carved with biblical and traditional scenes. One depicts St. Jerome removing a thorn from a lion's paw; another shows the Presentation of Christ. Over 60 capitals within St. Lazare are known to be the works of Gislebertus and include other biblical narratives including Samson, the prophet Habakkuk, Cain & Abel, St. Peter, as well as capitals containing Christ and the Apostles. The intricate carvings that make up the capitals by Gislebertus vividly display the narrative it is meant to be picturing.\n\nOwing to a near-collapse in the 19th century, the capitals under the central tower were replaced by replicas; the originals can be viewed up close in the upstairs chapter house (entrance to the right of the choir). Among the scenes on the capitals in the chapter house are the Flight into Egypt, God Questioning Cain, the Hanging of Judas, and the Adoration of the Magi.\n\nGislebertus is conceiving the capitals through liturgical drama. This capitals depicts the angel's attempt to wake the three sleeping magi. The angel points to the star in attempt to have the three magi to follow the star. The narrative of the three magi extends along the columns in the nave. Each capital shows great detail and a vivid depiction of the story it is telling.\n\nWhen Judas realizes what he has done to Jesus he repents. In his horror he hangs himself, unable to bear disobeying his master. The capital shows Judas with an open face shown in a grimace with his tongue out. The capital also depicts demons pulling Judas up and hanging him. Gislebertus actually uses one of the tendrils of the Corinthian capital in an innovative way to demonstrate what was used to hang Judas. The fire hair of the devils represents a reference to hell. Gislebertus displays a strong didactic image within the Suicide of Judas capital.\n\nThe Flight into Egypt capital by Gislebertus is located on the column opposite of the Adoration of the Magi narrative. The Flight into Egypt capital depicts Mary with a calm demeanour showing us her child as she sits upon the pony. She seems to be floating on the donkey rather than sitting on him, a position similar to the enthroned Madonna and Child.\n\nThis capital depicts Charity defeating Greed and Patience conquering Wrath. Such a carving would remind parishioners that evil intentions must be overcome if purity of heart and life is to prevail. This Romanesque capital would provide a didactic function for pilgrims that were illiterate and unable to read the script. The vice and virtues capital contains acanthus leaves on the background with Charity and Patience stepping upon the \"vices\" which are demonic creatures.\n\nGislebertus' \"Temptation of Eve\" (French: \"La Tentation d'Ève\") was originally the lintel of the north door of the cathedral. It is stated that the Temptation of Eve was created around the 1130s at the same time in which the Last Judgment and the narrative capitals were made. This large sculpture is now displayed in the Musée Rolin, Autun, France.\n\nThe Last Judgment is believed to have been created around 1130. The tympanum was saved from potential ruin as the canons who were managing the cathedral in the eighteenth century believed that Gislebertus' work was ugly, they covered it with plaster. The tympanum was rediscovered and released from the plaster in 1837.\n\nIn 1766, the canons decided that the sculpture was not worth keeping because it was mediocre. They then covered everything in a layer of plaster in order to affix other art work on top of the tympanum. Not until 1837 when another canon curiously began to chip away at the plaster was the tympanum discovered. Luckily, it was preserved underneath the plaster with the exception of the head of Christ which was documented to have been removed so that the plaster could fill the tympanum completely.\n\nThe West façade of St. Lazare contains the tympanum (1130–1135), signed \"Gislebertus hoc fecit \"(\"Gislebertus made this\") within the portico which is ranked amongst the masterpieces of Romanesque sculpture in France. However, art historian Linda Seidel challenged this reading, arguing that instead Gislebertus was a patron.\n\nThe sheer size of the tympanum required that double lintels support it with a middle column to further support the sculpture. The left side of the tympanum displays the rise to the heavenly kingdom, and on the right is a portrayal of the demons in hell with an angel and a devil weighing the souls on a balance.\n\nZodiac signs surround the arch vault with Christ in the center portrayed as a serene figure. Christ is placed in perfect symmetrical position with a balanced composition of elongated figures. Jesus is flanked by his mother, the Virgin Mary and his apostles cast as penitents and observers of the last judgment. St. Peter guards the gate to heaven and looks on as resurrected individuals attempt to squeeze in with the assistance of the angels.\n\nGislebertus successfully integrated the modern view of heaven and hell and created a sculpture that would act as a visual educational device for individuals that were illiterate. Viewing the tympanum would allow pilgrim's to know what would happen to them if they were to end up in hell. Two men near the centre of the lintel carry bags bearing a cross and a seashell. These are the symbols of pilgrims that travelled from Jerusalem to Santiago de Compostela.\n\nThe tympanum would have inspired terror in believers that passed beneath it and viewed the detailed high relief sculpture. The bottom of the tympanum underneath the weighing of the souls has an inscription that states, \"May this terror terrify those whom earthly error binds for the horror of the images here in this manner truly depicts what will be\". The tympanum is framed by two archivolts. The inner one has carved foliage while the outer archivolt consists of magnificently detailed medallions representing the four seasons, zodiacs, and labors of the months.\n\nThere have been various attempts to explain the fact that the figures and scenes on the lintel seem to be an unnecessary doubling of some of the figures and scenes from the main relief. It was argued, for example, that the people represented on the lintel await judgement or that the scene represents the idea of \"particular judgement\" as opposed to \"general judgement\", which is represented on the main relief. Dębicki rejects all these interpretations. According to him, the symbolism of the relief consistently reflects the theological views expressed by Honorius Augustodunensis in his Elucidarius. Specifically, the doubling is based on the idea that \"on judgement day two classes [of people] will be divided into four\" (\"in die judicii duo ordine in quattuor dividentur\"): the figures on the lintel represent the two general classes of people (the saved and the damned), while the figures on the tympanum represent the four particular classes.\n\n\n"}

He later came to withdraw from his position of equating the two, as it became heavily criticized.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "808418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=808418", "title": "Black cat", "text": "Black cat\n\nA black cat is a domestic cat with black fur that may be a mixed or specific breed. The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognizes 22 cat breeds that can come with solid black coats. The Bombay breed is exclusively black. All-black fur pigmentation is slightly more prevalent in male cats than female cats. Their high melanin pigment content causes most black cats to have yellow (golden) eyes (irises).\n\nAny cat whose fur is a single color, including black, is known as a \"solid\" or \"self\". A \"solid black\" cat may be coal black, grayish black, or brownish black. Most solid-colored cats result from a recessive gene that suppresses the tabby pattern. Sometimes the tabby pattern is not completely suppressed; faint markings may appear in certain lights, even on a solid black cat. A cat having black fur with white roots is known as a \"black smoke.\"\n\nBlack cats can also \"rust\" in sunlight, the coat turning a lighter brownish shade. Eumelanin, the pigment that is required to produce the black fur, is somewhat fragile, so the rusting effect can be more pronounced in cats that frequently spend time in the sun. A rarer condition that can also cause rusting is a deficiency of the enzyme tyrosine, which is required to produce eumelanin.\nIn addition to the Bombay, the Cat Fanciers' Association allows solid black as a color option in 21 other breeds. The color description for those breeds is:\n\nThe exceptions are:\n\nThe folklore surrounding black cats varies from culture to culture. The Scots believe that a strange black cat's arrival to the home signifies prosperity. In Celtic mythology, a fairy known as the Cat sìth takes the form of a black cat. Black cats are also considered good luck in the rest of Britain and Japan. Furthermore, it is believed that a lady who owns a black cat will have many suitors. In Western history, black cats have typically been looked upon as a symbol of evil omens, specifically being suspected of being the familiars of witches, or actually shape-shifting witches themselves. Most of Europe considers the black cat a symbol of bad luck, particularly if one walks across the path in front of a person, which is believed to be an omen of misfortune and death. In Germany, some believe that black cats crossing a person's path from right to left, is a bad omen. But from left to right, the cat is granting favorable times. In the United Kingdom it is commonly considered that a black cat crossing a person's path is a good omen.\n\nThe black cat in folklore has been able to change into human shape to act as a spy or courier for witches or demons. When the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock, they brought with them a devout faith in the Bible. They also brought a deepening suspicion of anything deemed of Satan and were a deeply suspicious group. They viewed the black cat as a companion, or a familiar to witches. Anyone caught with a black cat would be severely punished or even killed. They viewed the black cat as part demon and part sorcery. These superstitions led people to kill black cats. There is no evidence from England of regular large-scale massacres of \"satanic\" cats, or of burning them in midsummer bonfires, as sometimes occurred elsewhere in Europe.\n\nIn contrast, the supernatural powers ascribed to black cats were sometimes viewed positively; for example, sailors considering a \"ship's cat\" would want a black one because it would bring good luck. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea (see Ship's cat). The view of black cats being favorable creatures is attributed specifically to the Egyptian goddess Bast (or Bastet), the cat goddess. Egyptian households believed they could gain favor from Bastet by hosting black cats in their household. This view was held in the early 17th century by the English monarch Charles I. Upon the death of his treasured pet black cat, he is said to have lamented that his luck was gone. True to his claim, he was arrested the very next day and charged with high treason.\n\nPirates of the 18th century believed that a black cat would bring different kinds of luck. If a black cat walks towards someone, that person will have bad luck. If a black cat walks away from someone, then that person will have good luck.\n\nConversely in the United Kingdom if a black cat walks towards someone, it brings good fortune, but if it walks away, it takes the good luck with it. If a black cat walks onto a ship and then walks off it, the ship is doomed to sink on its next trip.\n\nBlack cats have been found to have lower odds of adoption in American shelters compared to other colors except brown, although black animals in general take more time to find homes. The reasons given include not only superstition, but also the perception of black as \"boring\" compared to other colors as well as the belief that black cats don't photograph well. Some shelters also suspend or limit adoptions of black cats around Halloween for fear they will be tortured, or used as \"living decorations\" for the holiday and then abandoned. Despite this, no one has ever documented in the history of humane work any relationship between adopting black cats and cats being killed or injured. When such killings are reported, forensic evidence has pointed to natural predators, such as coyotes, eagles, or raptors as the likely cause. Limiting or suspending adoptions around Halloween also places more cats of all colors at risk of dying in shelters due to overcrowding. \n\nAugust 17 is \"Black Cat Appreciation Day.\" Wayne H. Morris created the day in honor of his late sister, June, who had a black cat, Sinbad. The day was chosen in memorial of June's passing.\n\nIn the early days of television in the United States, many stations located on VHF channel 13 used a black cat as a mascot in order to make sport of being located on an \"unlucky\" channel number.\n\nSince the 1880s, the color black has been associated with anarchism. The black cat, in an alert, fighting stance was later adopted as an anarchist symbol.\n\nMore specifically, the black cat—often called the \"sab cat\" or \"sabo-tabby\"—is associated with anarcho-syndicalism, a branch of anarchism that focuses on labor organizing (see Wildcat strike).\n\nIn testimony before the court in a 1918 trial of Industrial Workers of the World leaders, Ralph Chaplin, who is generally credited with creating the IWW's black cat symbol, stated that the black cat \"was commonly used by the boys as representing the idea of sabotage. The idea being to frighten the employer by the mention of the name sabotage, or by putting a black cat somewhere around. You know if you saw a black cat go across your path you would think, if you were superstitious, you are going to have a little bad luck. The idea of sabotage is to use a little black cat on the boss.\"\n\nWhen the Space Shuttle program naming system for missions was reworked to avoid an STS-13, some sourced this to superstition and Apollo 13. The crew for what would have been STS-13 (what turned out to be STS-41C) made a humorous mission patch that included a black cat and a number 13. The mission was successful and even landed on Friday the 13th. The other main reason for the new numbering system was to better accommodate a much higher number of launches.\n\n\nOctober 27 has been designated ‘Black Cat Day’ by Cats Protection in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to celebrate the virtues of black cats and to encourage people to adopt an unwanted black cat. Cats Protection's own figures suggest that black cats are more difficult for them to find a new home for than other colours. In 2014, the RSPCA reported that 70% of the abandoned cats in its care were black, suggesting a possible reason was that people considered black cats \"un-photogenic\".\n\nIn the United States, \"Black Cat Appreciation Day\" is August 17. Research by the ASPCA shows that black cats are the least likely to be adopted from shelters of any type of cat. This can be partly because of the superstition behind black cats such as their association with witchcraft or bad luck, or because they appear dull next to more colorful cats. In 2014 Toronto, Canada's largest city, held an event on Black Friday during which people could adopt a black cat without paying the usual $75 adoption fee, in order to encourage the adoption of black cats. This trend had now spread across the United States, with many shelters offering free adoption of black cats on Black Friday.\n\nWith the success of the 2018 African-themed Superhero film, \"Black Panther\", there was a fad of adopting black domestic cats as pets and naming them after various characters of the film such as T'Challa and Shuri. It has been observed that usually people were not going out of their way to follow this fad, but visited animal shelters to simply adopt a pet under normal circumstances and were inspired by the Black Panther to adopt a black cat when they see one. Regardless, to reduce the chance of such cats being abandoned when the fad fades, reputable animal shelter personnel took the usual precautions of having potential adopters fill out questionnaires to weed out potentially abusive guardians and have them read literature about the needs and responsibilities of such a pet to dissuade the less conscientious.\n"}
{"id": "377447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=377447", "title": "Boom operator (media)", "text": "Boom operator (media)\n\nA boom operator is an assistant of the production sound mixer. The principal responsibility of the boom operator is microphone placement, usually using a boom pole (or \"fishpole\") with a microphone attached to the end (called a boom mic), their aim being to hold the microphone as close to the actors or action as possible without allowing the microphone or boom pole to enter the camera's frame.\n\nThe first noted use of a boom mic was on the set of \"Beggars of Life\" (1928) when director William A. Wellman wanted a tracking shot of two actors walking down a street, and the sound man refused, telling the director that the actors had to be static and the microphone had to be hidden in a flowery vase. Wellman said \"that's crazy\" and instructed the sound man to put the microphone on a broom-handle and walk along the actors just outside of the frame. According to David O. Selznick, \"I was also present on the stage when a microphone was moved for the first time by Wellman, believe it or not. Sound was relatively new and at that time the sound engineer insisted that the microphone be steady. Wellman, who had quite a temper in those days, got very angry, took the microphone himself, hung it on a boom, gave orders to record—and moved it.\"\n\nAnother instance of a prototype boom mic was on \"The Wild Party\" (1929). To allow Clara Bow to move freely on the set, director Dorothy Arzner had technicians rig a microphone onto a fishing rod.\n\nA patent was filed a year later for a very similar sound-recording device by Edmund H Hansen, a sound engineer at the Fox Film Corporation.\n\nOften in television studios, the boom operator will use a \"fisher boom\", which is a more intricate and specialized piece of equipment on which the operator stands, allowing precise control of the microphone at a greater distance from the actors. They will also attach wireless microphones to persons whose voice requires recording. Boom poles are usually manufactured from several lengths of aluminum or carbon fibre tubing, allowing the boom to be extended and collapsed as the situation requires.\n\nSome poles have a microphone cable routed through the inside of the pole, which may be a regular cable protruding at the bottom end, or a coiled cable that can extend with the pole, connecting to a socket at the base into which the operator plugs the microphone cable. The ideal boom pole is lightweight and strong, supporting the weight of the microphone on the end while adding as little weight as possible.\n\nFrequently, a wind-attenuating cover, called a \"blimp\" or \"mic-blimp\", is used to enclose the microphone. A blimp covered with sound-absorbing fuzzy fabric is usually nicknamed a windmuff or a \"dead cat\". In film crew jargon, the gruesome-sounding phrase \"dead cat on a stick\" is simply a boom microphone fitted with a fuzzy wind-screen.\n\nThe boom operator and production sound mixer may often be combined into a job performed by one person, usually when the crew number is to be kept minimal, such as for documentaries or news collecting, or in low-budget productions. The one-man unit is often known simply as a \"sound recordist\" or \"sound man\", and would perform all on set sound duties.\n\nThe boom operator must decide where to place the microphone based on a combination of factors, including the location and projection of any dialogue, the frame position of the camera, the source of lighting (and hence shadows) and any unwanted noise sources. Often the boom operator will need to be as familiar with the script as are the actors, as they may be required to tilt or move the microphone according to who is speaking.\n\nIn productions with a bigger budget, more than one boom operator may be used, with each operator focusing on a different actor.\n\nHaving the boom mic or its shadow appear on the screen in a completed picture is considered a sign of poor film-making. Notable examples include the mic's shadow appearing above two crewmen flying a plane in \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and the mic itself dipping into the frame numerous times in Rudy Ray Moore's film \"Dolemite\". The TV Tropes wiki has a list on its \"Visible Boom Mic\" trope page demonstrating more examples. Pastiches of bad film-making may also use boom mic visibility to spoof their material.\n\n"}

{"id": "1932284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1932284", "title": "Catalogue raisonné", "text": "Catalogue raisonné\n\nA catalogue raisonné is a comprehensive, annotated listing of all the known artworks by an artist either in a particular medium or all media. The works are described in such a way that they may be reliably identified by third parties.\n\nThere are many variations, both broader and narrower than \"all the works\" or \"one artist\". The parameters may be restricted to one type of art work by one artist or widened to all the works by a group of artists.\n\nIt can take many years to complete a \"catalogue raisonné\", and large teams of researchers are sometimes employed on the task. For example, it was reported in 2013 that the Dedalus Foundation (established by the abstract-expressionist painter Robert Motherwell) took 11 years to complete the three-volume catalogue raisonné of Motherwell’s work which was published by Yale University Press in 2012, with approximately 25 people contributing to the project.\n\nEarly examples consisted of two distinct parts, a biography and the catalogue itself. Their modern counterpart is the critical catalogue which may contain personal views of the author.\n\nThe term \"catalogue raisonné\" is French, meaning \"reasoned catalogue\" (i.e. containing arguments for the information given, such as attributions), but is part of the technical terminology of the English-speaking art world. The spelling is never Americanized to \"catalog\", even in the United States. The French pluralization \"catalogues raisonnés\" is used.\n\n\"The New York Times\" has described catalogues raisonnés as the definitive, scholarly compendia of an artist's work, the \"supreme arbiter of the genuine and fake\". In the case of deceased artists the producer of a catalogue raisonné which is regarded as a standard text may have considerable power to determine whether a particular work is regarded as authentic or not. In this context \"producers\" may include authors, editors, committees or publishers.\n\nInclusion in or exclusion from a respected catalogue raisonné can have a considerable effect on the market price of a work, amounting in some cases to large sums of money. Inclusion has been called the difference between \"great wealth and the gutter\", and auction houses sometimes refuse to handle unlisted works. As a result, catalogue raisonné authors have been the targets of lawsuits, and allegedly of bribes and even death threats<ref name=\"New York Times 2014/02/03\">Cohen, Patricia (2 February 2014). \"A Modigliani?

The painting was submitted to the Wildenstein Institute which is the publisher of the catalogues raisonnés most widely accepted as authoritative on the subject of Renoir paintings. The result of this submission was that the Institute, acting in accordance with the wishes of a descendant of the original author of the catalogues, refused to include it in future editions. This decision was taken despite the fact that the Institute had been presented with considerable evidence of the painting's authenticity.\n\nIn contrast to this decision the edition of the programme broadcast in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2014 investigated one of a group of paintings reputedly by French post-impressionist Édouard Vuillard and on this occasion a committee of the Wildentstein Institute decided that the painting should be included in their catalogue raisonné for the artist. The art dealer and historian Philip Mould stated while presenting the programme that this painting would be worth approximately £250,000 if it was accepted for inclusion in the catalogue raisonné, but that if it was not accepted it would be worth approximately £1,500 'as a piece of decorative art' – less than 1% of the full value.\n\nIn 2012 the \"New York Times\" reported that some scholars and artists' foundations have decided not to publish future catalogues raisonnés because they fear being sued by buyers or sellers unhappy with their conclusions. The question of whether producers of catalogues raisonnés should accept responsibility for determining authenticity of works was debated at a seminar on 29 March 2012 held at Christies, New York under the auspices of the Catalogue Raisonné Scholars Association.\n\nAn example of individual policies is given by the Wildenstein Institute's stated policy with regard to authentication of artworks which (at 8 February 2014) was as follows: 'After examination, and based on the opinion of the members of the committee, a recommendation is made in the form of the intention to include or not to include the work under study; a third possibility also exists, that of continuing the examination of the work. Under no circumstance is a recommendation to be considered as a certificate of authenticity or appraisal, and no justification will be provided for said recommendation.’ This policy contrasts with the text of the letter from the Institute which was read out on the television programme about the Monet painting, in which the Institute appeared to reject the authenticity of the work.\n\nDifficulties can occur when more than one catalogue raisonné is published for the same oeuvre. The work of the artist Modigliani is the subject of at least five catalogues raisonnés.\n\nEven if there is no published catalogue raisonné for an artist there may be an organisation which publishes authentications of work which are regarded as having the same effect as a formal catalogue. In the edition of \"Fake or Fortune?\" first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2014, an example of such a committee was featured. The subject of the programme was a painting which bore a signature reading \"Marc Chagall\" thus implying that it had been painted by the Russian-French artist of that name. It had been included in a reference work on the painter, but not in the most recent edition of that work, and forensic tests showed that it was painted with pigments not available at the time it was purported to have been executed. Despite this uncertain evidence of authenticity the makers of the programme submitted it to a group referred to as the \"Chagall Committee\", which includes descendants of the artist. This committee ruled that the painting is a fake and sought its destruction either with the agreement of the owner or, failing that, by court order under the French law of Droit moral. The art historian Dr Bendor Grosvenor criticised the Chagall Committee's decision to seek the destruction of the painting, which contrasts with the policy of the Wildenstein Institute when works are submitted to it: 'Whatever the committee's recommendation, the work will be returned upon presentation of the consignment receipt'. Presenter and art dealer Philip Mould said \"I would now [think] three times or more before sending it to Paris. Ugly acts like the one proposed by the Committee can have the effect of damaging the progress of art history.\"\n\n\n"}

Some academics consider young adult literature to be included under the rubric of 'children's literature.'\n\nNearly every school of theoretical thought has been applied to children's literature, most commonly reader response (Chambers 1980) and new criticism. However, other schools have been applied in controversial and influential ways, including Orientalism (Nodelman 1992), feminist theory (Paul 1987), postmodernism (Stevenson 1994), structuralism (Neumeyer 1977), post-structuralism (Rose, 1984, Lesnik-Oberstein, 1994) and many others.\n\nEarly children's literature critics aimed to learn how children read literature specifically (rather than the mechanics of reading itself) so that they could recommend \"good books\" for children. These early critics were often teachers, librarians and other educationalists. The critics often disagreed about what books they think children would like, and why, and about which books will be \"good\" for children and why. Though many critics are still child-centric, the discipline has expanded to include other modes of analysis. As children's literature criticism started developing as an academic discipline (roughly in the past thirty years or so, see historical overviews by Hunt (1991) and McGillis (1997)), children's literature criticism became involved with wider work in literary theory and cultural studies.\n\nMany children's literature critics now point out that children are not one group, but differ according to gender, ethnicity, religious background, and so on. Feminist children's literature critics such as Lissa Paul (1987) therefore try to work out how boys and girls read differently, for instance. Other critics (for instance, Peter Hunt (1991), Perry Nodelman (1992), John Stephens (1992), and Roderick McGillis (1996)) take this idea a step further and argue that children are often \"colonized\" by adults, including children's literature critics, because adults speak on behalf of children instead of letting children express themselves. However, these critics too can not agree on what then are \"true\" children expressing themselves, and which books are therefore \"good\" for them. Finally, a few critics, notably Jacqueline Rose (1984) and Karin Lesnik-Oberstein (1994 and 2004) take this discussion even further, arguing that identities are created and not \"inherent\", and that in the case of an identity such as \"childhood\" it is created by \"adults\" in the light of their own perceptions of themselves. That is, \"adulthood\" defines \"childhood\" in relation to differences and similarities it perceives to itself. This post-structuralist approach is similar to that argued by critics in gender studies such as Judith Butler and is widely accepted and used in sociological and anthropological studies of childhood (Jenks 1996; Jenks, James and Prout 1997).\n\nMany scholars approach children's literature from the perspective of literary studies, examining the text \"as text\" without focus on audience. Stephens and McCallum (1998) discuss the intertextuality of children's literature, while Rose explores the identifying characteristics of the genre. Nodelman (1990) looks at the synthesis of text and illustration in picturebooks.\n\nCulture studies scholars investigate children's literature as an aspect of culture. Children's literature, in this light, is a product consumed like other aspects of children's culture: video games, television, and the like. For more analysis of children's culture in general, see Jenkins. For literature in particular as cultural artifact, see Mackey.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1574472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1574472", "title": "Cliff Hanger (comic strip)", "text": "Cliff Hanger (comic strip)\n\nCliff Hanger is the name of two different 1983 comic strips, one published in the United Kingdom and the other in the United States.\n\nThe British \"Cliff Hanger\" was written and drawn by Jack Edward Oliver. It first appeared in the 25 June 1983 issue of the British comics magazine Buster. \n\nWatching a television show called 'Now Get Out of This' (a parody of Now Get Out of That), Cliff remarks that he thinks he could get out of everything. This is overheard by the Evil Spies, agents of M.E.S.S. (the Mysterious Evil Spies Society). They tell Cliff that he's now a guinea pig in their traps, and if he doesn't survive, they'll know the traps will be good enough to use against secret agents.\n\nFrom then on, the premise of the strip every week would be that Cliff is suddenly transported into a dangerous situation by the spies, using the Atomic Matter Transmitter. Three options would be presented to the readers, who would select one by ticking one of the boxes, and turning to another page to see whether their choice was correct or not. For example, in the first strip, Cliff is stranded on a moving artificial desert island. Just as it's about to hit the shore, the current changes and Cliff is driven back into the shark infested sea. The choices were 'Take off his shoe and use it to paddle the island to the shore', 'Pull out the tree and use it as a raft' and 'Climb the tree'. A and B were incorrect- using the shoe as a paddle simply sent Cliff round in circles, and pulling out the tree revealed it was plugging a hole, causing the island to sink. The correct answer was C, as Cliff's weight caused the tree to bend over onto the shore, lifting Cliff to safety.\n\nThe strip featured several minor background details that would occur in every issue, including a box with a handle, a plaster, the word 'Acme', an arrow with another (backwards facing) arrow inside it, a warthog, the initials 'JEO', a worm, and a sign saying \"Abolish Tuesdays\". A running gag would feature one of the Evil Spies' constant wondering why his counterpart would frequently call him \"Ray\" even though that wasn't his name, when in fact he was simply referring to one of the gadgets (\"Fire the Transporter Ray!\").\nAnother thing of note is that Cliff's jumper often featured the strip number on it, starting with a \"1\" in the first, and going on well into the hundreds at the end. Over the years, several continuous storylines emerged featuring parodies of popular film and television series of the day, including James Bond, the Star Wars Trilogy, Back to the Future and Transformers. The strip ended in 1987, replaced by Vid Kid.\n\nHowever, as Buster moved into the 1990s, the amount of reprints started to dramatically increase, and several old strips began to reappear. Cliff Hanger was one of these, though as J. Edward Oliver was still working for the comic, he was able to turn the originally black and white pages into full colour. With most of the readers unaware that these were reprints, this gave the impression that they were brand new. In February 1998, when the strips started being reprinted for a third time, rather than continue to advertise them as new, the Cliff Hanger Classic strand was started. Here there would be an afterword at the bottom of the strips, written by Jack, featuring factual information like the original issue dates, background details explained, the most popular television programmes of that week, or the top 5 of that week's UK Singles Chart.\n\nBy 1999, virtually the entire comic featured reprints. Because of this, J. Edward Oliver decided to draw one final strip, which appeared in issue 118/99, dated 7–21 July 1999 (the comic had become a fortnightly publication in 1995). Finding the Evil Spies in danger, all three options led to the conclusion that the Evil Spies would never trap Cliff again (if Cliff called the police, the spies would be arrested, if Cliff helped them out, they would stop trapping Cliff as a gesture of thanks, etc.). This issue also featured the final appearance of 'b-mail', the name used at the time for the Letters Page (which Jack also wrote). Cliff's final appearance was in a cameo appearance in the last page of Buster's final issue, which occurred half a year later. Explaining how all the characters ended, and once again drawn by J. Edward Oliver, Cliff was seen mourning the passing of Bernie Banks (the lead character in Memory Banks, another Buster strip) who had apparently forgotten how to breathe. Symbolising that this was indeed the final issue, his jumper carried the word 'END'.\n\nThe American \"Cliff Hanger\" was written by Bruce Jones with artwork by Al Williamson. The title character was a swashbuckling adventurer who crashlands in an unnamed jungle region in the late 1930s and finds himself in a mysterious plot involving a secret research facility. \n\nThe strip originally appeared as a back-up feature in the four issue run of Somerset Holmes, a 1983 thriller comic book also by Jones and Williamson. It has been reprinted in collections of Williamson's artwork.\n"}
{"id": "19110121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19110121", "title": "Color mixing", "text": "Color mixing\n\nThere are two types of color mixing: \"Additive\" and \"Subtractive\". In both cases, there are three primary colors, three secondary colors (colors made from 2 of the three primary colors in equal amounts), and one tertiary color made from all three primary colors. This point is a common source of confusion, as there are different sets of primary colors depending on whether you are working with additive or subtractive mixing.\n\nThe additive mixing of colors is unintuitive as it does not correspond to the mixing of physical substances (such as paint) which would correspond to subtractive mixing. For instance, one can additively mix yellow and blue by shining yellow light together with blue light, which will result in not green but a white light. As in this example, one should always have the mixture of light in mind when considering additive color mixing as it is the only situation where it occurs. Despite being unintuitive, it is conceptually simpler than subtractive mixing. Two beams of light that are superimposed correspond to additive mixing.\n\nBy convention, the three primary colors in additive mixing are red, green, and blue. In the absence of color, when no colors are showing, the result is black. If all three primary colors are showing, the result is white. When red and green combine, the result is yellow. When red and blue combine, the result is magenta. When blue and green combine, the result is cyan. \n\nAdditive mixing is used in television and computer monitors to produce a wide range of colors using only three primary colors. A pixel is a juxtaposition of these three primary colors. Projection televisions typically have three projectors, one for each primary color.\n\nThe mixing of colored physical substances corresponds to subtractive color mixing, hence it corresponds to our intuition about mixing colors. To explain the mechanism, let us consider mixing red paint with yellow paint. The red paint is red because when the ambient light strikes it, the composition of the material is such that it absorbs all other colors in the visible spectrum except for red. The red light, not being absorbed, reflects off the paint and is what we see. This same mechanism describes the color of all material objects -- note that light is not a material object -- and so applies to the yellow paint as well. Making recourse to the figure above demonstrating additive color mixing, one sees that yellow light is composed of an (additive) mixture of red and green light. When we mix the two paints, the resulting substance has red paint and yellow paint. The yellow paint absorbs all colors except for red and green. However, the red paint will absorb the green reflected by the yellow paint. The red paint can be said to subtract the green from the yellow paint. The resulting paint reflects only red light and so appears red to our eyes. Note however that this description is theoretical and that the mixing of pigments does not correspond to ideal subtractive color mixing because some light from the subtracted color is still being reflected by one component of the original paint. This results in a darker and desaturated color compared to the color that would be achieved with ideal filters.\n\nThe three primary colors in subtractive mixing that produce the largest gamut are yellow, magenta and cyan, leading to the CMYK color model widely used in color printing. Historically, painters have used yellow, red and blue in place of these, resulting in reduced gamut. In subtractive mixing of color, the absence of color is white and the presence of all three primary colors is black. The secondary colors are the same as the primary colors from additive mixing, and vice versa. This is not an accident. By mixing additive secondary colors subtractively one can reachieve the primary additive colors. Subtractive mixing is used to create a variety of colors when printing on paper by combining a small number of ink colors, and also when painting. Red is created by mixing magenta and yellow (removing green and blue). Green is created by mixing cyan and yellow (removing red and blue respectively). Blue is created by mixing cyan and magenta (removing red and green). Black can be approximated by mixing cyan, magenta, and yellow, although real pigments are not ideal and so pure black is nearly impossible to achieve.\n\n\n\n"}

For a total of forty three member states of the Council of Europe, the Conventions total ratification/accession has reached forty-two countries since it was opened for signature in 1985. It entered into force on 1 December 1987.\n\nAfter 30 years of collaboration among member states of the Council of Europe, this convention constitutes an important framework for the safeguarding of the Cultural Heritage of monuments and sites. \nThe Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage in Europe, along with the Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society, Faro and European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritages, comprise the thrust of cultural heritage protection and development in Europe.\n\nThe issues addressed in this convention are defined by the following objectives: \n\n\nThe starting point of this convention, mentioned in the preamble, was the European Cultural Convention signed in 1954. After that, the first action toward the protection and safeguarding of cultural heritage promoted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe started in 1963 through the creation of Europa Nostra, which promoted the intergovernmental cooperation within Europe.\n\nThe overall aim is first give a cultural references improving their environment in the European context, and secondly fostering a sustainable development considering economic enhancement and social development.\nIs stated that European parties, by the accordance of common principles, can commit themselves in a permanent collaboration for conservation policies.

Several scholars have supposed that a young Raphael collaborated on the predella.\nThe Madonna is portrayed on a luminous landscape of hills, on a high throne; in front of her is a pedestal with, on it, a mystic vase, and featuring the signature and date, which were always added by Perugino when the painting was produced in his workshop and then shipped to the destination. Mary holds the Child in the same fashion of the Decemviri Altarpiece of 1495-1496.\n\nAt the sides are the saints John the Baptist (with a camel skin and a stick with the cross), Louis of Toulouse, who wears a bishop dress, Francis of Assisi (reading), Peter with the Keys of Heaven, Paul (with a long beard and a red vest) and Mary Magdalene with offerings to the Madonna. The portico is a typical element of Perugino's paintings of the period, such as the Albani Torlonia Polyptych; also typical of his late works is the Madonna's figure as a more mature woman, different than the elegantly youthful portrayal painted before. Less usual are the differentiated proportions of the saints and of the Madonna herself.\n\nThe lunette depicts Jesus raised from his sepulchre by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, with Mary and John the Apostle at the sides. The predella includes the scenes of the \"Nativity of Mary\", the \"Presentation of Jesus at the Temple\", the \"Marriage of the Virgin\", the \"Annunciation\" and the \"Assumption\".

By 1711, in Lyon, illegalities were already being defined in regards to fashion materials, and in 1787, in England and Scotland fashion designers had fruitfully pushed their needs for protection into basic legislation. In 1876 Germany began protecting fashion patterns as well as models, and in 2002 European regulation on designs that were new and provided an aspect of fresh character or aesthetic were brought under protection. From 2004 to 2006 the “total production volume for clothing decreased by about 5% each year… [and by] 2006 the European union trade deficit for clothing was at 33.7 billion.” These statistics show that while there are benefits of their advanced design legislation, the economic and external factors still hindered their industry growth in ways the U.S. can empathize with. As 2007 came to a close, WIPO, or the World Intellectual Property Organization, had registered twenty-nine international designs.\n\nThere are some elements of protection of fashion design, with limited effectiveness. The copyright law covers creative elements of fashion designs, such as print patterns. Trademark law protects items with visibly displayed protected logos. Intellectual property laws protect \"trade dress\", which is an appearance of a product which uniquely identifies its source to the level of a trademark.\n\nSome countries introduced other laws to protect fashion design, however the protection is inconsistent around the world.\n\nIn the European Union, the Creative Designs Directive and the European Designs Directive are in effect to protect new designs for three or five years.\n\nAs of late 2015, fashion designs were not subject to copyright laws in the United States, and could not be copyrighted. Several bills named Design Piracy Prohibition Act and some other similar ones attempted to introduce protection of apparel.\n\nResercher Johanna Blakley argues that the very lack of regulation of fashion design has allowed the fashion industry to do very well economically and has lead to the birth of fast fashion and a much faster changing of fashion trends and has enabled pieces of clothing to become pieces of art. She also refers to Tom Ford pointing out that the people who buy cheap lookalikes are a different demographic compared with people who buy the original very high end products and that while many exclusive designers get copied, also the high end designers often attribute the inspiration of their creations to following street fashion so the copying is a two way street.\n"}
{"id": "23668992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23668992", "title": "Geocriticism", "text": "Geocriticism\n\nGeocriticism is a method of literary analysis and literary theory that incorporates the study of geographic space. The term designates a number of different critical practices. In France, Bertrand Westphal has elaborated the concept of \"géocritique\" in several works. In the United States, Robert Tally has argued for a geocriticism as a critical practice suited to the analysis of what he has termed \"literary cartography\".\n\nSome of the first expressly \"geocritical\" writings emerged from symposia organized by Westphal at the University of Limoges. Westphal's foundational essay, \"Pour une approche géocritique des textes\" constitutes a manifesto for geocriticism. Westphal's theory is elaborated in greater detail in his \"Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces\", translated by Tally, who also provides a brief introduction. But there are also many works addressing similar themes and using similar methods that might be considered geocritical, even if the term \"geocriticism\" is not used.\n\nIn Westphal's theory, geocriticism is based on three theoretical concepts: spatio-temporality, transgressivity, and referentiality. \n\nThe idea that space and time form a continuum (space-time) is a tenet of modern physics. In the field of literary theory, geocriticism is an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses not only on such temporal data as relations between the life and times of the author (as in biographical criticism), the history of the text (as in textual criticism), or the story (as studied by narratology), but also on spatial data. Geocriticism therefore has affinities with geography, architecture, urban studies, and so on; it also correlates to philosophical concepts such as deterritorialization.\nFollowing the work of Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Henri Lefebvre and Mikhail Bakhtin, among others, a geocritical approach to literature recognizes that representations of space are often transgressive, crossing the boundaries of established norms while also reestablishing new relations among people, places, and things. Cartography is no longer seen as the exclusive province of the state or the government; rather, various agents or groups may be responsible for representing the geographic spaces at the same time and with different effects. In practice, therefore, geocriticism is multifocal, examining a variety of topics at once, thus differentiating itself from practices that focus on the singular point of view of the traveler or protagonist. \n\nGeocriticism also assumes a literary referentiality between world and text, or, in other words, between the referent and its representation. By questioning the relations between a given space's nature and its actually existing condition, the geocritical approach allows for a study of fiction that points also to the theory of possible worlds, such as may be seen in the work on third space by the American geographer Edward Soja (\"Thirdspace\"). Tally's book \"Spatiality\", an introduction to spatiality studies in literature and critical theory, includes a chapter on geocriticism.\n\nGeocriticism frequently involves the study of places described in the literature by various authors, but it can also study the effects of literary representations of a given space. An example of the range of geocritical practices can be found in Tally's collection \"Geocritical Explorations: Space, Place, and Mapping in Literary and Cultural Studies\".\n\nGeocriticism derives some of its practices from precursors whose theoretical work helped establish space as a valid topic for literary analysis. For example, in \"The Poetics of Space\" and elsewhere, Gaston Bachelard studied literary works to develop a typology of places according to their connotations. Maurice Blanchot's writings have legitimized the idea of literary space, an imaginary place for the creation of the work of literature. One might also look at the developments of cultural studies and especially postcolonial studies, such as Raymond Williams's \"The Country and the City\" or Edward Said's \"Culture and Imperialism\", which employ what Said has called a \"geographical inquiry into historical experience.\" Fredric Jameson's concept of cognitive mapping and his theoretical engagement with the postmodern condition also highlight the importance of spatial representation and aesthetic productions, including literature, film, architecture, and design. In \"The Atlas of European Novel, 1800-1900\", Franco Moretti has examined the diffusion of literary spaces in Europe, focusing on the complex relationship between the text and space. Moretti has also promulgated a theory of literary history, or literary geography, that would use maps to bring to light new connections between the texts studied and their social spaces. And, in his study of Herman Melville's literary cartography, Robert Tally has offered a geocritical approach to certain texts. \n\nGeocriticism has intellectual and methodological affiliations with such fields as Literature and the Environment or ecocriticism, regional literature, urban studies, sociological and philosophical approaches to literature, and utopian studies.\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n"}
{"id": "70647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70647", "title": "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner", "text": "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\n\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner is a 1967 American comedy-drama film produced and directed by Stanley Kramer, and written by William Rose. It stars Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier, and Katharine Hepburn, and features Hepburn's niece Katharine Houghton.\n\nThe film was one of the few films of the time to depict an interracial marriage in a positive light, as interracial marriage historically had been illegal in most states of the United States, and still was illegal in 17 states—mostly Southern states—until 12 June 1967, six months before the film was released, roughly two weeks after Tracy filmed his final scene (and two days after his death), when anti-miscegenation laws were struck down by the Supreme Court in \"Loving v. Virginia\". The film's Oscar-nominated score was composed by Frank De Vol.\n\nThe film is notable for being the ninth and final on-screen pairing of Tracy and Hepburn, with filming ending just 17 days before Tracy's death. Hepburn never saw the completed film, saying the memories of Tracy were too painful. The film was released in December 1967, six months after his death. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nTwenty-three year old Joanna Drayton's unannounced early return from her Hawaiian vacation causes a stir when she brings her new fiancé to her upper-class family home in San Francisco. He is John Prentice: a 37-year-old Negro (the 1967 dialogue uses the term Negro throughout) physician and medical professor, whom she met just 10 days prior, whose first wife and young son were killed in a train accident eight years earlier.\n\nJoanna's parents – newspaper publisher Matt Drayton and his wife, art gallery owner Christina – are avowed liberals who have always instilled in her the idea of racial equality. Although they try to hide it, Joanna's parents and in particular her father are initially upset that she is planning to marry a Negro man. The Draytons' black maid for 22 years, Tillie, is even more horrified, telling Joanna that John is trying to \"get above himself\" by marrying a white woman, but Joanna\nasks why it is okay that she loves Tillie but she shouldn’t love John, who is “just as black”.\n\nThe Draytons are unsettled by her engagement with John, since they never thought that her choice would be a Negro man, and further unsettled by John's decision that if Joanna's parents do not accept the engagement that day, then he will end it.\n\nAdding to the situation is that Joanna, at first intending to join John in a few weeks in Geneva for their planned marriage ceremony, has now decided that she will join him when he leaves after dinner to fly to a meeting in New York City, then onward to Switzerland, where he is an assistant director with the World Health Organization. She has also invited John's parents to fly up from Los Angeles for dinner, so they can all become acquainted. Due to this invitation, what was intended to be a sit-down steak dinner for two turns into a meet-the-in-laws dinner party. Furthermore, John is forced to reveal that he had not yet told his parents of his intention to marry a white woman.\n\nMatt's golf buddy, Catholic Monsignor Mike Ryan, stops by after Matt earlier cancelled their golf game. After learning of John, he shares Joanna's enthusiasm for the pending nuptials and tells her father as much. However, Matt says he cannot give the couple his blessing: he fears that Joanna will be hurt by the prejudice that John and she will surely encounter.\n\nOne of Christina's art gallery employees, Hilary, who had briefly met John and Joanna earlier in the day, stops by the Draytons' home to express her disapproval over the relationship. Though Christina is still unsure of her own feelings about the matter, she is so offended at Hilary's racism that she fires her on the spot. Later, when dressing for dinner, Christina shares with Matt her support for Joanna, even if it should mean having to fight her husband.\n\nCocktails at the Drayton home resemble a game of musical chairs, as different permutations of parents and clergy and children gather and share their views about the situation, with the mothers generally expressing more faith in their children than the fathers. Universally, the parents express that more than a few hours are necessary for a proper decision.\n\nMrs. Prentice tells Matt that her husband and he, in growing old, have forgotten what it is like to feel romantic passion; if they remembered, they would see that as more important for their children than any racial problem.\n\nWhen the elder Prentice tells John that he is making a huge mistake, John pushes back that his father thinks of himself “as a coloured man, (while) I think of myself as a man.”\n\nAfter thinking about the situation, and his conversation with Mrs. Prentice in particular, Matt calls everyone together (including Tillie) to make an announcement. He says that it does not matter what everyone else may think about John and Joanna getting married; all that matters is that they love each other. The film ends with the two families and Monsignor Ryan finally sitting down to dinner.\n\nProduction list\n\nAccording to Kramer, Rose and he intentionally structured the film to debunk ethnic stereotypes. The young doctor, a typical role for the young Sidney Poitier, was purposely created idealistically perfect, so that the only possible objection to his marrying Joanna would be his race, or the fact she had only known him for 10 days; the character has thus graduated from a top school, begun innovative medical initiatives in Africa, refused to have premarital sex with his fiancée despite her willingness, and leaves money in an open container on his future father-in-law's desk in payment for a long-distance phone call he has made. Nothing is made of the 14-year difference in their ages. Kramer and Rose completed the film script in five weeks.\n\nKramer stated later that the principal actors believed so strongly in the premise that they agreed to act in the project even before seeing the script. Production had been set for January 1967 and ended on May 24, 1967. Spencer Tracy was in poor health, and insurance companies refused to cover him. Kramer and Hepburn put their salaries in escrow so that if he died, filming could be completed with another actor. According to Kramer, \"You're never examined for insurance until a few weeks before a picture starts. [Even] with all his drinking and ailments, Tracy always qualified for insurance before, so nobody thought it would be a problem in this case. But it was. We couldn't get insurance for Spence. The situation looked desperate. So then we figured out a way of handling it. Kate and I put up our own salaries to compensate for the lack of an insurance company for Spence. And we were allowed to proceed.\"\n\nThe filming schedule was altered to accommodate Tracy's failing health. All of Tracy's scenes and shots were filmed between 9:00 am and noon of each day to give him adequate time to rest. For example, most of Tracy's dialogue scenes were filmed in such a way that during close-ups on other characters, a stand-in was substituted for him.\n\nTracy's failing health was more serious than most people are aware of. According to Poitier:\n\"The illness of Spencer dominated everything. I knew his health was very poor and many of the people who knew what the situation was didn't believe we'd finish the film, that is, that Tracy would be able to finish the film. Those of us who were close knew it was worse than they thought. Kate brought him to and from the set. She worked with him on his lines. She made sure with [Stanley] Kramer that his hours were right for what he could do, and what he couldn't do was different each day. There were days when he couldn't do anything. There were days when he was great, and I got the chance to know what it was like working with Tracy.\"\n\nA bust of Tracy sculpted by Hepburn herself was used as a prop, on the bookshelf behind the desk where Sidney Poitier makes his phone call. Tracy died two weeks after he completed his work on the film.\n\nHepburn significantly helped cast her niece, Katharine Houghton, for the role of Joey Drayton. Concerning this, Hepburn stated: \"There was a lovely part for Kathy [Houghton], my niece [...] She would play Spencer's and my daughter. I loved that. She's beautiful and she definitely had a family resemblance. It was my idea.\"\n\nAccording to Hepburn, the role of Joey Drayton would be one of Houghton's first major roles as a young actress. \"The part of my daughter,\" Kate said, \"was a difficult one. A young unknown actress needs more opportunity to win the sympathy of the audience. Otherwise, too much has to depend on her youth, innocence, and beauty. She had one good speech to win the audience, but it was cut. Instead she only talks with her father about the differences between the principles he taught her and the way he's behaving.\"\n\nPoitier frequently found himself starstruck and as a result, a bit tongue-tied, in the presence of Hepburn and Tracy, whom he considered to be \"giants\" as far as acting is concerned. However, Poitier reportedly found a way to overcome his nerves. \"When I went to play a scene with Tracy and Hepburn, I couldn't remember a word. Finally, Stanley Kramer said to me, 'What are we going to do?' I said, 'Stanley, send those two people home. I will play the scene against two empty chairs. I don't want them here because I can't handle that kind of company.' He sent them home. I played the scene in close-up against two empty chairs as the dialogue coach read Mr. Tracy's and Miss Hepburn's lines from off camera.\"\n\nGiven the tense nature of racism in the United States during the time of the film's production, Poitier felt he was \"under close observation\" by both Tracy and Hepburn during their first dinner meetings prior to production. However, he managed to swiftly win them over. Due to Tracy and Hepburn's close history with Kramer, Poitier cited that Hepburn and Tracy came to bear on him \"the kind of respect they had for Kramer, and they had to say to themselves (and I'm sure they did), this kid has to be pretty okay, because Stanley is nuts about working with him\".\n\nThe film premiered in theaters on January 1, 1968. The film falls into the genre of comedy drama. The film was released on VHS on December 12, 1987, on the 20th anniversary of the original release. The film was released on DVD on May 22, 2001.\n\n\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" was a box-office hit in 1968 throughout the United States, including in Southern states where it was traditionally assumed that few white filmgoers would want to see any film with black leads. The success of this film challenged that assumption in film marketing. Despite this success, which included numerous film award nominations, Frank Rich of \"The New York Times\" wrote in November 2008 that the film was frequently labeled as dated among liberals. Another main point of contention was the fact that Poitier's character, the golden future son-in-law, had no flaws and a resume of good deeds. Many people felt that the dynamic between the Draytons and Poitier's character would have inevitably resulted in a happily-ever-after film ending because Poitier's character was so perfect, respectable, likable, and proper. Some people went as far as saying Prentice was \"too white\" not to be accepted by the Draytons.\n\nThe release of the film in the U.S. gave Poitier his third box-office success in six months in 1967, all of which placed the race of Poitier's character at issue. The film grossed a total of $56.7 million.\n\nIn a 1986 review of the film by \"The New York Times\", Lawrence Van Gelder wrote: \"the suspicion arises that were the film made today its makers would come to grips a good deal more bluntly with the problems of intermarriage. Still, this remains a deft comedy and - most of all - a paean to the power of love.\"\n\nThe original version of the film that played in theaters in 1968 contained a moment in which Tillie responds to the question \"Guess who's coming to dinner now?\" with the sarcastic one-liner: \"The Reverend Martin Luther King?\" After King's assassination on April 4, 1968, this line was removed from the film, so by August 1968, almost all theaters' showings of this film had this line omitted. As early as 1969, the line was restored to many but not all prints, and the line was preserved in the VHS and DVD versions of the film, as well.\n\nThe plot explores similar themes to the 1958 play \"Hot Summer Night\" by Ted Willis.\n\nThe film won two Academy Awards and two British Academy Film Awards:\n\n\n\nStanley Kramer produced and directed an unsold 30-minute television pilot for ABC-TV with the same title and premise in 1975.\n\nIn 2003, comedian Daniele Luttazzi published the screenplay \"Tabù\", an almost parody of the film. In the variation, the engaged lovers are aged 40 (him) and 12 (her), and are brother and sister.\n\nThe 2005 film \"Guess Who\" starring Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac is a loose remake styled as a comedy rather than a drama, with the racial roles reversed: black parents are caught off-guard when their daughter brings home the young white man she has chosen to marry. Talking about the film, Bernie Mac told \"USA Today\" in 2003, \"Interracial dating is not that significant anymore.\" In the article, the writer cites that during the time at which the original movie was filmed, \"interracial marriage was considered risky.\" Casting for Mac's remake of the film began in November 2003. Mac said of the script, \"They want to make it a comedy, but I won't disrespect Spencer, Katharine or Sidney.\"\n\nThe Irish writer Roddy Doyle wrote a short story by the same title about an Irish girl who brings home an immigrant from Nigeria, published in 2008 in the collection \"The Deportees\".\n\nThe plot is very similar to another film, \"Crossroads\", made by the Canadian director Don Haldane a decade earlier in 1957. In this film, a young white woman in Toronto surprises her mother with her black fiancé.\n\nThe film was referenced in a 1988 episode of the sitcom \"Designing Women\" by Suzanne, who mistakenly calls it, \"There's Some Black People Comin' Over for Dinner.\"\n\nIn the episode \"Guess Who's Coming to Marry\" (season 2, episode 6) of the black sitcom \"Fresh Prince of Bel Air\", an aunt of the lead character introduces her fiancé, a white man, to the horror of her family.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21473990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21473990", "title": "Helmet (heraldry)", "text": "Helmet (heraldry)\n\nIn heraldic achievements, the helmet or helm is situated above the shield and bears the torse and crest. The style of helmet displayed varies according to rank and social status, and these styles developed over time, in step with the development of actual military helmets. In some traditions, especially German and Nordic heraldry, two or three helmets (and sometimes more) may be used in a single achievement of arms, each representing a fief to which the bearer has a right. For this reason, the helmets and crests in German and Nordic arms are considered to be essential to the coat of arms and are never separated from it.\n\nOpen-visored or barred helmets are typically reserved to the highest ranks of nobility, while lesser nobility and burghers typically assume closed helms. While these classifications remained relatively constant, the specific forms of all these helmets varied and evolved over time. \nIn ecclesiastical heraldry, bishops and other clergy use a mitre or other rank-appropriate ecclesiastical hat in place of a helmet.\n\nThe evolution of heraldic helmet shaped followed the evolution of helmet design, especially jousting helmets, from the 14th to 16th centuries.\nThe armorials of the second half of the 13th century do not include helmets. Helmets are shown as integral part of coats of in the first half of the 14th century (\"Codex Manesse\", \"Zürich armorial\"). These helmets are still of the \"great helm\" type, without movable visor. \nHeraldic helmets become diversified with the development of dedicated jousting armour during the 15th and 16th century. The development is halted with the abandonment of jousting as a courtly practice, in the early years of the 17th century. From that period, the various types of heraldic helmet are purely driven by convention, and no longer tied to improvements or fashions in armoury.\n\nThe practice of indicating rank through the display of barred or open-face helmets appears around 1615. \nAs jousting with lances was supplanted by tourneying with maces, the object being to knock the opponent's crest off his helmet, the fully enclosed helmet gave way to helmets with enlarged visual openings with only a few bars to protect the face. These barred helmets were restricted by the imperial chancellery in Vienna to the nobility and certain doctors of law or theology, while the jousting helm was freely adopted by anyone. \n\nThe direction a helmet faces and the number of bars on the grille have been ascribed special significance in later manuals, but this is not a period practice. A king's helmet, a golden helmet shown affronté with the visor raised, crowned with a royal crown, became adopted by the kings of Prussia. \n\nHistorically, the helmet was not specifically granted in an achievement of arms, but was naturally assumed by appropriate rank as a matter of \"inherent right\", so a helmet with torse and mantling would not be misplaced even above a shield which had no crest to place above it. When multiple crests need to be depicted, the convention in English heraldry is to draw the crests above a single helmet, each being separated from it, while in German heraldry, where multiple crests appear frequently after the 16th century, each crest is always treated as inseparable from its own helmet and turned in agreement with the helmet. \n\nIn continental Europe, multiple helmets were usually turned inward, with the center helm (if an odd number) turned affrontê, while in Scandinavian heraldry the helmets were usually turned outward. \nHeraldic combinations were driven to extremes in the 18th century, e.g. the arms of the last margraves of Brandenburg-Ansbach (Charles Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, r. 1737–1791) consist of a shield with 21 quarterings topped with a record thirteen helmets and crests.\n\nThe usage of heraldic helmets in Britain is as follows: gold helmet with bars for the royal family; silver helmet with gold bars for peers; steel helmet with gold bars for the non-peerage Scottish feudal baron; open steel helmet shown affronté for knights and baronets; steel tournament helm for Scottish clan chiefs; closed steel helmet for esquires and gentlemen. \nThe norms of Russian heraldry regarding helmets diverge greatly from the Western European tradition. Alongside the traditional Western open helmet (silver with gold details for titled nobility, steel with gold details for everyone else), as well as the closed helmet sometimes granted by the state, \"ethnic\" helmets were also in use, not found anywhere else. From the 19th century onwards, ancient Russian families began to use the , the \"cap of Jericho\", a medieval conical Slavic helmet similar to the Middle Eastern shishak. These followed their own colour system, not corresponding with the use of tinctures for Western helmets: non-titled nobles would use a steel \"yerikhonka\" with silver details, barons and counts steel with golden details, \"knyaz\" families silver with golden details. The House of Romanov itself used a unique \"yerikhonka\" called the , based on the royal helmet of Michael I (once mistakenly believed to have belonged to Alexander Nevsky, hence the name). Asian noble families non-Slavic origin who were integrated in the Empire were also allowed an ethnic helmet, usually a , similar to the \"yerikhonka\" in shape but rounder and with an obtuse tip. \n\nIn the modern Russian Federation, the Russian Heraldic Council allows both Western and ethnic helmets (called \"sheloms\" in modern Russian heraldic language), but only in their simplest forms, and stripped of any details that may be perceived as symbols of nobility. For Western helmets, this means using commoner kettle hats as opposed to them more aristocratic open and close helmets, while \"sheloms\" are to be used without nasal bars, cheekpieces or neck guards, which were sometimes found on older \"ethnic\" helmets.

Based in Chennai, India, the academy was founded in January 1936 by Rukmini Devi Neelakanta Sastri and her husband Arundale. Under Arundale's guidance, the institution achieved national and international recognition for its unique style and perfectionism. In 1962, Kalakshetra moved to a new campus in Besant Nagar, Chennai, occupying of land.\n\nIn January 1994, an Act of the Parliament of India recognised the Kalakshetra Foundation as an \"Institute of National Importance.\"\n\nKalakshetra, later known as the Kalakshetra Foundation, was established by Rukmini Devi Arundale, along with her husband, George Arundale, a well-known theosophist, in Adyar, Chennai, in 1936. She invited not only the best students but also noted teachers, musicians and artists to be a part of this institution.\n\nYear-long celebrations, including lectures, seminars and festivals marked her 100th birth anniversary, on 29 February 2004, at Kalakshetra and elsewhere in many parts of the world. Also on 29 February, a photo exhibition on her life opened at the Lalit Kala Gallery in New Delhi, and President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam released a photo-biography, written and compiled by Sunil Kothari, with a foreword by former president Ramaswamy Venkataraman. In 2016, marking its 80th year, the Kalakshetra Foundation held a 'Remembering Rukmini Devi’ festival of music and dance.\n\nHaving studied the Pandanallur style for three years, in 1936 Rukmini Devi Arundale started working on developing her own, Kalakshetra, style of Bharatanatyam. She introduced group performances and staged various Bharatanatyam-based ballets.\n\nThe Kalakshetra style is noted for its angular, straight, ballet-like kinesthetics, and its avoidance of Recakas and of the uninhibited throw (Ksepa) of the limbs.\n\nAccording to Sankara Menon (1907–2007), who was her associate from Kalakshetra’s beginnings, Rukmini Devi raised Bharatanatyam to a puritan art form, divorced from its recently controversial past by \"removing objectionable elements\" (mostly, the \"Sringara\", certain emotional elements evocative of the erotic, such as hip, neck, lip and chest movements) from the Pandanallur style, which was publicly criticized by Indian dancer Tanjore Balasaraswati (1918–1984) and other representatives of Tamil Nadu's traditional Isai Velalar culture. Love outside parameters considered \"chaste\" was not to be portrayed. Balasaraswati said that \"the effort to purify Bharatanatyam through the introduction of novel ideas is like putting a gloss on burnished gold or painting the lotus\". Lawyer and classical artist E. Krishna Iyer (1897–1968) said about Rukmini Devi, \"There is no need to say that before she entered the field, the art was dead and gone or that it saw a renaissance only when she started to dance or that she created anything new that was not there before\".\n\n\nNotable alumni include Radha Burnier, Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, Sanjukta Panigrahi, C.V. Chandrasekhar, Dhananjayans, Adyar K. Lakshman, Jayashree Narayanan, Leela Samson, Jaya Thyagarajan, Devoleena Bhattacharjee, and Ananda Shankar Jayant.\n\n\n"}

Founded as a non-profit institution in June 1925, the organization was dedicated to supporting and furthering the careers of talented young American classical musicians. While its goals remained the same, the organization became a for-profit incorporated institution in 1938. Robert E. Simon served as the organizations president for many years and Leon Barzin served as vice president. The organization ceased operations in the early 1960s.\n\nThe NML selected artists to support through annual competitive music auditions. Judges for the competition were leading musicians and teachers in the New York area, often pulling from faculty members at the Juilliard School and Manhattan School of Music. The only requirement to compete was that the artist be under the age of 30. Winners of the competition were then awarded by having a concert series organized and promoted for them by the NML, thereby helping them to gain wider public recognition. Artists who were supported by the NML included Josephine Antoine, Frances Blaisdell, Jean Carlton, Risë Stevens, and Thomas Llyfnwy Thomas among many others.\n\nIn 1935 the NML presented a production of Engelbert Humperdinck's \"Hänsel und Gretel\" at the White House after a luncheon hosted by Eleanor Roosevelt. The cast notably included bass John Gurney of later Metropolitan Opera fame as Peter.\n\nBeginning in 1950 the NML began a partnership with the Jeunesses Musicales International in France which resulted in an annual foreign-exchange of artists. The program would allow an American musician the opportunity to do a concert tour throughout France and a French artist a United States tour. American musicians to have participated in the exchange program to France included Sidney Harth (1951-1952), Theodore Lettvin (1951-1952), Lillian Kallir (1953), James Wolfe (1954), Shirlee Emmons (1954), and Betty Allen (1955) among others. French artists in the program included Pierre Sancan (1951-1952), Philippe Entremont (1953, 1955), and Blanche Tarjus (1954) among others. The exchange program expanded in 1953 to include artists from Brazil, beginning with Brazilian pianist Oriano de Almeida in 1954 and Brazilian soprano Edmée Brandi in exchange for American soprano Shirlee Emmons (1953) and violinist Joyce Flissler (1955). The Gioventù Musicale d'Italia began exchanging artists with the organization in 1955, as did the government of Mexico.\n"}

{"id": "14316100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14316100", "title": "Postdramatic theatre", "text": "Postdramatic theatre\n\nThe notion of postdramatic theatre was established by German theatre researcher Hans-Thies Lehmann in his book \"Postdramatic Theatre\", summarising a number of tendencies and stylistic traits occurring in avant-garde theatre since the end of the 1960s. The theatre which Lehmann calls postdramatic is not primarily focused on the drama in itself, but evolves a performative aesthetic in which the text of the performance is put in a special relation to the material situation of the performance and the stage. The post dramatic theatre attempts to mimic the unassembled and unorganized literature that a playwright sketches in the novel\n\nThus postdramatic theatre is more striving to produce an effect amongst the spectators than to remain true to the text. Lehmann locates what he calls 'the new theatre' as part of 'a simultaneous and multi-perspectival form of perceiving'; this, he argues is brought about, in large part, by a reaction to the dominance of the written text.\n\nThe new theatre, Lehmann asserts, is characterised by, amongst other things, the 'use and combination of heterogeneous styles', it situates itself as after or beyond dialogue and incorporates the notion of the 'performer as theme and protagonist'.\n\nIn its most radical varieties, postdramatic theatre knows no \"plot\" at all, but concentrates fully on the interaction between performer and audience.\n\nAnother way of using the notion is to describe plays with little or no drama, for instance the plays of Jon Fosse.\n\nSome names associated with postdramatic theatre are Tadeusz Kantor (Krakow), Heiner Müller (Berlin), Robert Wilson (New York City), The Wooster Group (New York City), The Builders Association (New York City), Richard Foreman (New York City), Big Art Group (New York City), Jan Fabre, Jan Lauwers and Needcompany, Frank Castorf (Berlin), Josef Szeiler/TheaterAngelusNovus (Vienna), Elfriede Jelinek (Vienna), Heiner Goebbels (Frankfurt), Verdensteatret (Oslo), Alvis Hermanis (Riga), Forced Entertainment (Sheffield), Teater Moment (Stockholm), the Apocryphal Theatre (London), The Sydney Front (Australia) and Socìetas Raffaello Sanzio (Italy), Navid Memar Kermani (Amta Theater Group-Iran).\n\nA new wave of post-dramatic performance companies are troubling the work of those past. These companies include the likes of Pan Pan (Ireland), POST (Australia), Action Hero (United Kingdom), Nature Theatre of Oklahoma (United States), and more.\n\nA new generation of internationally working postdramatic directors is changing the big picture: Among them are Thomas Luz, Amir Reza Koohestani, Susanne Kennedy, Dusan David Parizek, Yael Ronen, Simon Stone, Kai Tuchmann, Anna Bergmann,Bastian Kraft,Ulrich Rasche, Niklas Stemann, and Kay Voges.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49132517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49132517", "title": "Ruth Lingford", "text": "Ruth Lingford\n\nRuth Lingford is an Independent animator. Since 2005, she has taught at the Harvard University. She now holds a position as Faculty member in the Visual and Environmental Studies, where she is Senior lecturer and Director of Undergraduate Studies. She previously taught at the Royal College of Art and the National Film and Television School, UK. Before investing herself in Animation, she was an Occupational therapist working with the elders and people suffering from mental disorders. Lingford completed a BA in Fine Arts and Art History at the Middlesex Polytechnic (Middlesex University) from 1987 to 1990 and a MA at the Royal College of Art until 1992.\n\nLingford began her work in animation when she made \"Baggage\" and \"Crumble\" (both 1992) as part of her MA. \"Baggage\" and \"Crumble\" circulated in some film festivals, after their debut at the Royal College of Art's graduation show, including the Animefest Zagred, and the Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival. After their limited festival run, and struggles to find stability, Lingford made \"What She Wants\" (1994) with funding of a grant from the Animate! programme (co-founded by for the Arts Council of England/Channel 4). For \"What She Wants\", Lingford resorted to use her Amiga 1500 computer – having no access to animation equipments –, doing individual frames on Deluxe Paint. Lingford had learnt rudimentary usage of the computer in a workshop at the RCA, when hand-drawn animation remained the dominant technique. \"What She Wants\"'s individual images were saved across approximately 20 Floppy disks.\n\nOn her next project, Ruth Lingford was invited at the Museum of the Moving Image, for an 'unusual' residency. Developing a second commission for Channel 4, \"Death and the Mother\" (1997), Lingford returned again to her primitive methods of computer animation. The creative process, however, would take place in full view of the people navigating through the museum : Lingford would be working in a glass room. The film drew inspiration from German expressionist woodcut, and catapulted Lingford on the international animation scene. Upon completion, in 1997, \"Death and the Mother\" won many awards, including one at Annecy International Animated Film Festival of the same year. The surface, content and reputation of \"Death and the Mother\" drew attention on Lingford from Orly Yadin and Sylvie Bringas. She was asked to collaborate on their project, \"Silence\" (1998), where Lingford would be working along Tim Webb on the animation of \"Silence\"'s sequence. Lingford worked on one half of the film which takes place in an animated Theresienstadt, while Webb worked on the second half, which takes place in Sweden. On \"Silence\", she returned to Deluxe Paint to draw preliminary images which were finished by Yadin. Overall, the visual she partly built won \"Silence\" several important awards including : the Gold Hugo for Animation Short at the 1998 Chicago International Film Festival and the Grand Prix of the 1999 Odense Film Festival.\n\nLingford's following project, \"Pleasures of War\", of the same year, moved against \"the 'plastic' gloss-orientation of much computer-generated imagery\". Perhaps due to the success of \"Silence\", she approached novelist and Christian theologian Sara Maitland, who Lingford remembered for her short story \"The Swallow and the Nightingale\" (from her \"Far North and Other Dark Tales\" collection)\". Pleasures of War\" was scripted by Maitland, who also collaborated on the general design of the work, based on the deuterocanonical Book of Judith – a story in which two women bargain sexual favours to protect their city from besiegers. Within the film are merged, collaged, newsreel footage from armed conflicts around the world, the victims of these conflicts.\n\n\"The Old Fools\" (2002) was Ruth Lingford's following project, again, commissioned by Channel 4. It is an adaptation of the Philip Larkin's homonymous poem – written while her mother was in nursing home. In terms of style, \"The Old Fools\" marks a departure from Lingford's computer-drawn evocative imagery ; its aesthetics rather combining DV footage, drawings and typography animated in After Effects and Painter. With the Shynola collective, Lingford worked next on a music video for the music band Unkle, \"An Eye for an Eye\" (2002). The collaboration was successful, and remained inlined with Lingford's previous imagery : \"a sublimely creepy evocation of the biological drives and desires\". Lingford also collaborated on a fellow Harvard professors' film: \"Secrecy\" (2008), where her animated sequences served \"to create a contrast between imaginary and literal realms of the secrecy system\". Likewise, she animated sequences from another film – \"We Still Live Here: Âs Nutayuneân\" (2010) – by Anne Makepeace.\n\n\"Little Deaths\" (2010), Lingford's latest standalone work, begun after she received a 2008–09 Harvard Film Study Center Fellowship. In the pre-production process, she wanted to 'interview' people about their orgasms. Lingford recalled she expected her interviewees to lack proper words to describe their private experiences, but they did not. She used their commentary, in \"celebrat[ing] key aspects of our experience that are often suppressed,\" and continued to develop her experimental aesthetic of animation \"to evoke the elusive physical and emotional experience of orgasm\".\n\nAs of recently, Lingford as been part of the band \"What Time Is It, Mr. Fox?\" for whom she has animated the song \"The Ladies' Tree\", and sang as a back vocalist.\n"}

Since its inception the organization has produced numerous exhibitions, and presented the work of hundreds of artists in four different locations in DUMBO. \nIn 1998 Smack Mellon began a partnership with the Walentas family and their company Two Trees Management. At that time, Two Trees had a number of vacant historic, industrial properties throughout DUMBO and was interested in providing their spaces to not-for-profit organizations to use for cultural programming. From 1998 to 2005 Smack Mellon occupied a Civil War-era iron foundry, which had been turned into a spice milling and grinding facility in the 1950s. Since 2005 Smack Mellon has been located at 92 Plymouth Street in a former coal-fired boiler house that provided steam for heat and power to several industrial buildings in the neighborhood.\n\nToday, Smack Mellon’s Exhibition Program continues to advance public interest in the visual arts while providing opportunities for emerging and under-recognized visual artists whose opportunities for exhibition have been limited to realize ambitious projects.

As rents continue to increase astronomically throughout the City, it is increasingly difficult, if not virtually impossible for artists to find affordable, appropriate studio space. In response to the studio crisis faced by artists in New York City, Smack Mellon's Studio Program provides much needed workspace, and financial and technical support to aid artists in the creation of new work. Smack Mellon receives over 600 applications for six available studios each year. Expenses, including museum admissions, transportation and food, are paid during the program.\n\nSmack Mellon’s arts education initiative, Art Ready engages young people in a way no other arts education program does, it pairs students directly with working artists; the students learn first hand over the course of a school year what it is to be an artist in the artist’s studio. The program operates during the school year and includes a series of studio visits with emerging and established artists; a series of field trips to museums and galleries; 2-3 art workshops; and a four-month arts mentorship. Art Ready connects up to twenty high school students with ten diverse artists, to gain practical experience working with professionals in a variety of artistic disciplines. The program is free for students. Working as mentors, the artists provide professional and creative guidance as the students make decisions about their futures in the arts. Mentor/teaching artists also tutor the students in their creative process, introduce them to new ways of working, and engage them in continuous critical reflection. Art Ready truly prepares high school aged students for artistic careers and gives them practical experience working in a diversity of artistic disciplines.\n\n"}

{"id": "95157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95157", "title": "Symbolism (arts)", "text": "Symbolism (arts)\n\nSymbolism was a late nineteenth-century art movement of French, Russian and Belgian origin in poetry and other arts.\n\nIn literature, the style originates with the 1857 publication of Charles Baudelaire's \"Les Fleurs du mal\". The works of Edgar Allan Poe, which Baudelaire admired greatly and translated into French, were a significant influence and the source of many stock tropes and images. The aesthetic was developed by Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine during the 1860s and 1870s. In the 1880s, the aesthetic was articulated by a series of manifestos and attracted a generation of writers. The name \"symbolist\" itself was first applied by the critic Jean Moréas, who invented the term to distinguish the Symbolists from the related Decadents of literature and of art.\n\nDistinct from, but related to, the style of literature, symbolism in art is related to the gothic component of Romanticism and Impressionism.\n\nThe term \"symbolism\" is derived from the word \"symbol\" which derives from the Latin \"symbolum\", a symbol of faith, and \"symbolus\", a sign of recognition, in turn from classical Greek σύμβολον \"symbolon\", an object cut in half constituting a sign of recognition when the carriers were able to reassemble the two halves. In ancient Greece, the \"symbolon\" was a shard of pottery which was inscribed and then broken into two pieces which were given to the ambassadors from two allied city states as a record of the alliance.\n\nSymbolism was largely a reaction against naturalism and realism, anti-idealistic styles which were attempts to represent reality in its gritty particularity, and to elevate the humble and the ordinary over the ideal. Symbolism was a reaction in favour of spirituality, the imagination, and dreams. Some writers, such as Joris-Karl Huysmans, began as naturalists before becoming symbolists; for Huysmans, this change represented his increasing interest in religion and spirituality. Certain of the characteristic subjects of the Decadents represent naturalist interest in sexuality and taboo topics, but in their case this was mixed with Byronic romanticism and the world-weariness characteristic of the \"fin de siècle\" period.\n\nThe Symbolist poets have a more complex relationship with Parnassianism, a French literary style that immediately preceded it. While being influenced by hermeticism, allowing freer versification, and rejecting Parnassian clarity and objectivity, it retained Parnassianism's love of word play and concern for the musical qualities of verse. The Symbolists continued to admire Théophile Gautier's motto of \"art for art's sake\", and retained – and modified – Parnassianism's mood of ironic detachment. Many Symbolist poets, including Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine, published early works in \"Le Parnasse contemporain\", the poetry anthologies that gave Parnassianism its name. But Arthur Rimbaud publicly mocked prominent Parnassians and published scatological parodies of some of their main authors, including François Coppée – misattributed to Coppée himself – in \"L'Album zutique\".\n\nOne of Symbolism's most colourful promoters in Paris was art and literary critic (and occultist) Joséphin Péladan, who established the Salon de la Rose + Croix. The Salon hosted a series of six presentations of avant-garde art, writing and music during the 1890s, to give a presentation space for artists embracing spiritualism, mysticism, and idealism in their work. A number of Symbolists were associated with the Salon.\n\nSymbolists believed that art should represent absolute truths that could only be described indirectly. Thus, they wrote in a very metaphorical and suggestive manner, endowing particular images or objects with symbolic meaning. Jean Moréas published the Symbolist Manifesto (\"Le Symbolisme\") in \"Le Figaro\" on 18 September 1886 (see 1886 in poetry). The Symbolist Manifesto names Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, and Paul Verlaine as the three leading poets of the movement. Moréas announced that symbolism was hostile to \"plain meanings, declamations, false sentimentality and matter-of-fact description\", and that its goal instead was to \"clothe the Ideal in a perceptible form\" whose \"goal was not in itself, but whose sole purpose was to express the Ideal.\"\n\nIn a nutshell, as Mallarmé writes in a letter to his friend Cazalis, 'to depict not the thing but the effect it produces'.\n\nThe symbolist poets wished to liberate techniques of versification in order to allow greater room for \"fluidity\", and as such were sympathetic with the trend toward free verse, as evident in the poems of Gustave Kahn and Ezra Pound. Symbolist poems were attempts to evoke, rather than primarily to describe; symbolic imagery was used to signify the state of the poet's soul. T. S. Eliot was influenced by the poets Jules Laforgue, Paul Valéry and Arthur Rimbaud who used the techniques of the Symbolist school, though it has also been said that 'Imagism' was the style to which both Pound and Eliot subscribed (see Pound's \"Des Imagistes\"). Synesthesia was a prized experience; poets sought to identify and confound the separate senses of scent, sound, and colour. In Baudelaire's poem \"Correspondences\", (considered to be the touchstone of French Symbolism) also mentions \"forêts de symboles\" – forests of symbols –\n\nand Rimbaud's poem \"Voyelles\":\n\n– both poets seek to identify one sense experience with another. The earlier Romanticism of poetry used symbols, but these symbols were unique and privileged objects. The symbolists were more extreme, investing all things, even vowels and perfumes, with potential symbolic value. \"The physical universe, then, is a kind of language that invites a privileged spectator to decipher it, although this does not yield a single message so much as a superior network of associations.\" Symbolist symbols are not allegories, intended to represent; they are instead intended to evoke particular states of mind. The nominal subject of Mallarmé's \"Le cygne\" (\"The Swan\") is of a swan trapped in a frozen lake. Significantly, in French, \"cygne\" is a homophone of \"signe\", a sign. The overall effect is of overwhelming whiteness; and the presentation of the narrative elements of the description is quite indirect:\n\nOf the several attempts at defining the essence of symbolism, perhaps none was more influential than Paul Verlaine's 1884 publication of a series of essays on Tristan Corbière, Arthur Rimbaud, Stéphane Mallarmé, Marceline Desbordes-Valmore, Gérard de Nerval, and \"Pauvre Lelian\" (\"Poor Lelian\", an anagram of Paul Verlaine's own name), each of whom Verlaine numbered among the \"poètes maudits\", \"accursed poets.\"\n\nVerlaine argued that in their individual and very different ways, each of these hitherto neglected poets found genius a curse; it isolated them from their contemporaries, and as a result these poets were not at all concerned to avoid hermeticism and idiosyncratic writing styles. They were also portrayed as at odds with society, having tragic lives, and often given to self-destructive tendencies. These traits were not hindrances but consequences of their literary gifts. Verlaine's concept of the \"poète maudit\" in turn borrows from Baudelaire, who opened his collection \"Les fleurs du mal\" with the poem \"Bénédiction\", which describes a poet whose internal serenity remains undisturbed by the contempt of the people surrounding him.\n\nIn this conception of genius and the role of the poet, Verlaine referred indirectly to the aesthetics of Arthur Schopenhauer, the philosopher of pessimism, who maintained that the purpose of art was to provide a temporary refuge from the world of strife of the will.\n\nSchopenhauer's aesthetics represented shared concerns with the symbolist programme; they both tended to consider Art as a contemplative refuge from the world of strife and will. As a result of this desire for an artistic refuge, the symbolists used characteristic themes of mysticism and otherworldliness, a keen sense of mortality, and a sense of the malign power of sexuality, which Albert Samain termed a \"fruit of death upon the tree of life.\" Mallarmé's poem \"Les fenêtres\" expresses all of these themes clearly. A dying man in a hospital bed, seeking escape from the pain and dreariness of his physical surroundings, turns toward his window but then turns away in disgust from\n\nand in contrast, he \"turns his back on life\" (\"tourne l’épaule à la vie\") and he exclaims:\n\nThe symbolist style has frequently been confused with decadence, the name derived from French literary critics in the 1880s, suggesting the writers were self indulgent and obsessed with taboo subjects. A few writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Jean Moréas' manifesto was largely a response to this polemic. By the late 1880s, the terms \"symbolism\" and \"decadence\" were understood to be almost synonymous. Though the aesthetics of the styles can be considered similar in some ways, the two remain distinct. The symbolists were those artists who emphasized dreams and ideals; the Decadents cultivated \"précieux\", ornamented, or hermetic styles, and morbid subject matters. The subject of the decadence of the Roman Empire was a frequent source of literary images and appears in the works of many poets of the period, regardless of which name they chose for their style, as in Verlaine's \"Langueur\":\n\nA number of important literary publications were founded by symbolists or became associated with the style. The first was \"La Vogue\" initiated in April 1886. In October of that same year, Jean Moréas, Gustave Kahn, and Paul Adam began the periodical \"Le Symboliste\". One of the most important symbolist journals was \"Mercure de France\", edited by Alfred Vallette, which succeeded \"La Pléiade\"; founded in 1890, this periodical endured until 1965. Pierre Louÿs initiated \"La conque\", a periodical whose symbolist influences were alluded to by Jorge Luis Borges in his story \"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote\". Other symbolist literary magazines included \"La Revue blanche\", \"La Revue wagnérienne\", \"La Plume\" and \"La Wallonie\".\n\nRémy de Gourmont and Félix Fénéon were literary critics associated with symbolism. The symbolist and decadent literary styles were satirized by a book of poetry, \"Les Déliquescences d'Adoré Floupette\", published in 1885 by Henri Beauclair and Gabriel Vicaire.\n\nSymbolism in literature is distinct from symbolism in art although the two were similar in many aspects. In painting, symbolism can be seen as a revival of some mystical tendencies in the Romantic tradition, and was close to the self-consciously morbid and private decadent movement.\n\nThere were several rather dissimilar groups of Symbolist painters and visual artists, which included Gustave Moreau, Gustav Klimt, Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis, Jacek Malczewski, Odilon Redon, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Henri Fantin-Latour, Gaston Bussière, Edvard Munch, Félicien Rops, and Jan Toorop. Symbolism in painting was even more widespread geographically than symbolism in poetry, affecting Mikhail Vrubel, Nicholas Roerich, Victor Borisov-Musatov, Martiros Saryan, Mikhail Nesterov, Léon Bakst, Elena Gorokhova in Russia, as well as Frida Kahlo in Mexico, Elihu Vedder, Remedios Varo, Morris Graves and David Chetlahe Paladin in the United States. Auguste Rodin is sometimes considered a symbolist sculptor.\n\nThe symbolist painters used mythological and dream imagery. The symbols used by symbolism are not the familiar emblems of mainstream iconography but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, symbolism in painting influenced the contemporary Art Nouveau style and Les Nabis.\n\nSymbolism had some influence on music as well. Many symbolist writers and critics were early enthusiasts of the music of Richard Wagner, an avid reader of Schopenhauer.\n\nThe symbolist aesthetic affected the works of Claude Debussy. His choices of \"libretti\", texts, and themes come almost exclusively from the symbolist canon. Compositions such as his settings of \"Cinq poèmes de Charles Baudelaire\", various art songs on poems by Verlaine, the opera \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" with a libretto by Maurice Maeterlinck, and his unfinished sketches that illustrate two Poe stories, \"The Devil in the Belfry\" and \"The Fall of the House of Usher\", all indicate that Debussy was profoundly influenced by symbolist themes and tastes. His best known work, the \"Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune\", was inspired by Mallarmé's poem, \"L'après-midi d'un faune\".\n\nThe symbolist aesthetic also influenced Aleksandr Scriabin's compositions. Arnold Schoenberg's \"Pierrot Lunaire\" takes its text from German translations of the symbolist poems by Albert Giraud, showing an association between German expressionism and symbolism. Richard Strauss's 1905 opera \"Salomé\", based on the play by Oscar Wilde, uses a subject frequently depicted by symbolist artists.\n\nSymbolism's style of the static and hieratic adapted less well to narrative fiction than it did to poetry. Joris-Karl Huysmans' 1884 novel \"À rebours\" (English title: \"Against Nature\" or \"Against the Grain\") explored many themes that became associated with the symbolist aesthetic. This novel, in which very little happens, catalogues the psychology of Des Esseintes, an eccentric, reclusive antihero. Oscar Wilde was influenced by the novel, it being a major influence in writing his play Salome and Huysman's book appears in \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", with the titular character becoming corrupted after reading the book.\n\nPaul Adam was the most prolific and representative author of symbolist novels. \"Les Demoiselles Goubert\" (1886), co-written with Jean Moréas, is an important transitional work between naturalism and symbolism. Few symbolists used this form. One exception was Gustave Kahn, who published \"Le Roi fou\" in 1896. In 1892, Georges Rodenbach wrote the short novel \"Bruges-la-morte\", set in the Flemish town of Bruges, which Rodenbach described as a dying, medieval city of mourning and quiet contemplation: in a typically symbolist juxtaposition, the dead city contrasts with the diabolical re-awakening of sexual desire. The cynical, misanthropic, misogynistic fiction of Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly is sometimes considered symbolist, as well. Gabriele d'Annunzio wrote his first novels in the symbolist manner.\n\nThe characteristic emphasis on an internal life of dreams and fantasies have made symbolist theatre difficult to reconcile with more recent trends. Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's drama \"Axël\" (rev. ed. 1890) is a definitive symbolist play. In it, two Rosicrucian aristocrats become enamored of each other while trying to kill each other, only to agree to commit suicide mutually because nothing in life could equal their fantasies. From this play, Edmund Wilson adopted the title \"Axel's Castle\" for his influential study of the symbolist literary aftermath.\n\nMaurice Maeterlinck, also a symbolist playwright, wrote \"The Blind\" (1890), \"The Intruder\" (1890), \"Interior\" (1891), \"Pelléas and Mélisande\" (1892), and \"The Blue Bird\" (1908).\nEugénio de Castro is considered one of the introducers of Symbolism in the Iberian Peninsula. He wrote \"Belkiss\", \"dramatic prose-poem\" as he called it, about the doomed passion of Belkiss, The Queen of Sheba, to Solomon, depicting in a avant-guard and violent style the psychological tension and recreating very accurately the tenth century BC Israel. He also wrote \"King Galaor\" and \"Polycrates' Ring\", being one the most prolific Symbolist theoriticians. \n\nLugné-Poe (1869–1940) was an actor, director, and theatre producer of the late nineteenth century. Lugné-Poe \"sought to create a unified nonrealistic theatre of poetry and dreams through atmospheric staging and stylized acting\". Upon learning about symbolist theatre, he never wanted to practice any other form. After beginning as an actor in the Théâtre Libre and Théâtre d'Art, Lugné-Poe grasped on to the symbolist movement and founded the Théâtre de l'Œuvre where he was manager from 1892 until 1929. Some of his greatest successes include opening his own symbolist theatre, producing the first staging of Alfred Jarry's \"Ubu Roi\" (1896), and introducing French theatregoers to playwrights such as Ibsen and Strindberg.\n\nThe later works of the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov have been identified by essayist Paul Schmidt as being much influenced by symbolist pessimism. Both Konstantin Stanislavski and Vsevolod Meyerhold experimented with symbolist modes of staging in their theatrical endeavors.\n\nDrama by symbolist authors formed an important part of the repertoire of the \"Théâtre de l'Œuvre\" and the \"Théâtre d'Art\".\n\nAmong English-speaking artists, the closest counterpart to symbolism was aestheticism. The pre-Raphaelites were contemporaries of the earlier symbolists, and have much in common with them. Symbolism had a significant influence on modernism, (Remy de Gourmont considered the Imagists were its descendants) and its traces can also be detected in the work of many modernist poets, including T. S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, Conrad Aiken, Hart Crane, and W. B. Yeats in the anglophone tradition and Rubén Darío in Hispanic literature. The early poems of Guillaume Apollinaire have strong affinities with symbolism. Early Portuguese Modernism was heavily influenced by Symbolist poets, especially Camilo Pessanha; Fernando Pessoa had many affinities to Symbolism, such as mysticism, musical versification, subjectivism and transcendatilism.\n\nEdmund Wilson's 1931 study \"Axel's Castle\" focuses on the continuity with symbolism and several important writers of the early twentieth century, with a particular emphasis on Yeats, Eliot, Paul Valéry, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, and Gertrude Stein. Wilson concluded that the symbolists represented a dreaming retreat into\nthings that are dying–the whole belle-lettristic tradition of Renaissance culture perhaps, compelled to specialize more and more, more and more driven in on itself, as industrialism and democratic education have come to press it closer and closer.\"\n\nAfter the beginning of the 20th century, symbolism had a major effect on Russian poetry even as it became less popular in France. Russian symbolism, steeped in the Eastern Orthodoxy and the religious doctrines of Vladimir Solovyov, had little in common with the French style of the same name. It began the careers of several major poets such as Alexander Blok, Andrei Bely, and Marina Tsvetaeva. Bely's novel \"Petersburg\" (1912) is considered the greatest example of Russian symbolist prose.\n\nPrimary influences on the style of Russian Symbolism were the irrationalistic and mystical poetry and philosophy of Fyodor Tyutchev and Solovyov, the novels of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the operas of Richard Wagner, the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche, French symbolist and decadent poets (such as Stéphane Mallarmé, Paul Verlaine and Charles Baudelaire), and the dramas of Henrik Ibsen.\n\nThe style was largely inaugurated by Nikolai Minsky's article \"The Ancient Debate\" (1884) and Dmitry Merezhkovsky's book \"On the Causes of the Decline and on the New Trends in Contemporary Russian Literature\" (1892). Both writers promoted extreme individualism and the act of creation. Merezhkovsky was known for his poetry as well as a series of novels on \"god-men\", among whom he counted Christ, Joan of Arc, Dante, Leonardo da Vinci, Napoleon, and (later) Hitler. His wife, Zinaida Gippius, also a major poet of early symbolism, opened a salon in St Petersburg, which came to be known as the \"headquarters of Russian decadence\". Andrei Bely's Petersburg (novel) a portrait of the social strata of the Russian capital, is frequently cited as a late example of Symbolism in 20th century Russian literature.\n\nIn Romania, symbolists directly influenced by French poetry first gained influence during the 1880s, when Alexandru Macedonski reunited a group of young poets associated with his magazine \"Literatorul\". Polemicizing with the established \"Junimea\" and overshadowed by the influence of Mihai Eminescu, Romanian symbolism was recovered as an inspiration during and after the 1910s, when it was exampled by the works of Tudor Arghezi, Ion Minulescu, George Bacovia, Mateiu Caragiale, Tristan Tzara and Tudor Vianu, and praised by the modernist magazine \"Sburătorul\".\n\nThe symbolist painters were an important influence on expressionism and surrealism in painting, two movements which descend directly from symbolism proper. The harlequins, paupers, and clowns of Pablo Picasso's \"Blue Period\" show the influence of symbolism, and especially of Puvis de Chavannes. In Belgium, symbolism became so popular that it came to be known as a national style, particularly in landscape painting: the static strangeness of painters like René Magritte can be considered as a direct continuation of symbolism. The work of some symbolist visual artists, such as Jan Toorop, directly affected the curvilinear forms of art nouveau.\n\nMany early motion pictures also employ symbolist visual imagery and themes in their staging, set designs, and imagery. The films of German expressionism owe a great deal to symbolist imagery. The virginal \"good girls\" seen in the cinema of D. W. Griffith, and the silent film \"bad girls\" portrayed by Theda Bara, both show the continuing influence of symbolism, as do the Babylonian scenes from Griffith's \"Intolerance\". Symbolist imagery lived on longest in horror film: as late as 1932, Carl Theodor Dreyer's \"Vampyr\" showed the obvious influence of symbolist imagery; parts of the film resemble \"tableau vivant\" re-creations of the early paintings of Edvard Munch.\n\n\nFrench\n\nFrench Uruguayan\nBelgian\n\nGerman and Austrian\n\nPortuguese\nRussian\n\nSerbian\n\nArmenian\n\nGeorgian\n\nPolish\n\nSee Also: Young Poland movement\n\nEnglish\n\nOthers\nEnglish language authors who influenced or were influenced by symbolism include:\n\nFrench\n\nRussian\n\nSee Also: \"Russian Symbolism\" and the Blue Rose group.\n\nBelgian\n\nRomanian\n\nSee also:\"Symbolist Movement in Romania\"\n\nGerman\n\nSwiss\n\nAustrian\n\nOthers\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There was a belief that the figures represented would become available for the service of the deceased in the afterlife. The figures are made of moulded earthenware with colour generally being added, though often not over the whole figure, or in naturalistic places. Where the colouring was in paint it has often not survived, but in many cases it was in \"sancai\" (\"three-colour\") ceramic glaze, which has generally lasted well.\n\nThe figures, called \"mingqui\" in Chinese, were most often of servants, soldiers (in male tombs) and attendants such as dancers and musicians, with many no doubt representing courtesans. In burials of people of high rank there may be soldiers and officials as well. The animals are most often horses, but there are surprising numbers of both Bactrian camels and their Central Asian drivers, distinguished by thick beards and hair, and their facial features. The depictions are realistic to a degree unprecedented in Chinese art, and the figures give archaeologists much useful information about life under the Tang. There are also figures of the imaginary monster \"earth spirits\" and the fearsome human Lokapala (or \"tian wang\"), both usually in pairs and acting as tomb guardians to repel attacks by both spirits and humans. Sets of the twelve imaginary beasts of the Chinese Zodiac are also found, usually unglazed.\n\nThe figures represent a development of earlier traditions of Chinese tomb figures, and in the Tang elaborate glazed figures are restricted to north China, very largely to the areas around the capitals. They \"virtually disappear\" from 755 when the highly disruptive An Lushan Rebellion began, which probably affected the kilns in Henan and Hebei making the pieces as well as their elite clientele. A much diminished tradition continued in later dynasties until the Ming. The use of \"sancai\" glazing on figures was restricted to the upper classes, and production was controlled by the imperial bureaucracy, but a single burial of a member of the imperial family might contain many hundreds of figures.\n\nA thousand years before the Tang figures, the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (d. about 433 BC) contained the bodies of 22 musicians, as well as the instruments they played. Traces of wooden figures wearing textiles are known from similar dates, and the First Emperor's Terracotta Army is famous; his funeral also involved the killing and burial of many servants and animals, including all his childless concubines. The excavated Han dynasty tombs we know about contained bronze or pottery figures of horses, and often groups of soldiers, well below life-size, in the tombs of commanders. Lower down the social scale, pottery models of houses and animals were very common, and continued into the Tang. By the time of the short-lived but effective Sui dynasty (581–618), the pattern of Tang tomb figures was essentially established, though the polychromy of \"sancai\" colours did not appear until the Tang.\nThe size and number of the figures in a grave depended on the rank of the deceased, as did the number that were glazed. Servants and farm animals were often glazed, painted or slip-painted white, or brown in the case of animals. The figures were paraded on carts as part of the funeral procession. They were then lined up outside the tomb before the coffin was taken inside. Once this was in place they were taken inside the tomb and arranged in the tomb, often along the sloping access way to the underground burial chamber, or in an ante-chamber to it. In large tombs there were niches built into the tomb walls for them to occupy.\n\nUntil recent years most pieces came from excavations that were not done by archaeologists and knowledge of the context of pieces was lacking. The important tomb of the Tang Princess Li Xianhui (or Yongtai) from 705 was discovered in 1960 in the imperial Qianling Mausoleum complex, and professionally excavated from 1964, the first of a number of excavations of major tombs, though others have been left deliberately undisturbed. It had been robbed in the past, probably soon after the burial, and items in precious materials taken, but the thieves had not bothered with the 777 unglazed and painted and around 60 glazed tomb figures (now mostly Shaanxi History Museum). These were mostly in \"solid ranks\" in stepped niches off the long sloping entrance way.\n\nGrand tombs were conceived as \"a personalized paradise mirroring the best aspects of the earthly world\", approached by a spirit road with stone statues, and ministered to by priests in temples and altars around the mound. Underground, they also contained extensive frescos with painted representations of the same types of figure as the pottery, and the images in the two media worked together to recreate a palace geography evoking the residence and lifestyle of the deceased before death. The entrance ramp recreated the approach to a grand palace, the sections with frescos and figure niches reflecting the various enclosures and courtyards of the sprawling palace complexes of Tang royalty. Niches with horses and grooms were nearer the entrance than those with musicians and court ladies; niches were typically flanked by frescos of attendants in charge of that area. This was imagined as much from the tomb chamber outwards as from the tomb entrance inwards; despite Chinese concepts of Hell and paradise, the spirit of the deceased was believed to continue to inhabit and roam the tomb, and the intention was to provide suitable facilities of all kinds. Indeed, within tomb complexes such as the Qianling Mausoleum complex, visits by the deceased to the neighbouring tombs of the imperial family, accompanied by huge processions, were envisaged, and saddled pottery horses stood waiting for the entourage, for visits or hunting.\n\nThe size of figures varies considerably, from about 10 to 110 centimetres high for a standing human figure, and about 55 to 120 or more for the largest types, the beasts and guardians. Different scales of figures were usually mixed within tombs, depending on the status of the people or animals depicted. There is some indication that glazed and unglazed figures may have been made at different kilns. The figures are low-fired earthenware, since strength and durability were not required. The clay body fires to a \"whitish\" colour, except for a smaller group of less fine reddish pieces, normally covered in white slip.\n\nThe figures are moulded, usually from several pieces, with the head always made separately, and the larger animals in the most parts. The various pieces were luted together before firing, with the opportunity taken to vary identical figures by joining the heads at slightly different angles. The clay was often worked by hand, luting on small extra details and textures, and sometimes working on the surface with tools. In earlier figures a joint line running up the side of the body can often be seen. The two types of guardian figures For an unknown reason, the heads of horses either face straight ahead or turn to the left; they almost never turn to the right.\n\nWhen the clay work was complete, a white slip was applied all over, then any glaze was added to the figure before firing. Smaller figures might have a clear or slightly yellow glaze, and in larger ones the glaze was often kept off the face and hands, which were painted after firing. Sui and early Tang figures, before \"sancai\" was used, normally have the transparent glaze. The application of the coloured glazes can be very variable; in many pieces the colours are carefully applied to different parts of the figures, but in others \"they have been splashed on without regard for design or contour\". A cobalt blue was added to the \"sancai\" palette during the period, and at least one horse is partly coloured blue. Some figures had elements in wood, such as weapons, polo-sticks, or rope halters for horses and camels, which have not survived.\n\nThe best period for the figures lasted only about 50 years, to the An Lushan Rebellion of 755, a period of innovation, unprecedented realism and an interest in showing psychological types in several media for Chinese art. The figures share with Buddhist monumental sculpture of the period conventions, derived from further west, that show \"appropriate detail of muscle which yet departs from reality at many points\". The horse figures reflect the same ideal as seen in contemporary paintings, and it is uncertain in which medium the type first arose.\n\nWith exception of the Zodiac figures, which were also the only type to increase in popularity after the Tang, the figures are \"more closely related to the metropolitan and Buddhist attitudes than to the magical aspects of rural beliefs and a pattern of behaviour governed by superstitions or shamanistic beliefs of the local farming communities\", which partly accounts for their failure to return after the 750s, along with a preference for new types of grave goods.\n\nThe group of 13 Tang dynasty tomb figures of Liu Tingxun, a general who died in 728, represent a fine group of the usual major figures, all in \"sancai\". There are four tomb guardians, and pairs of officials (these are all on a similar scale), horses and camels, plus three grooms, this group on a considerably smaller scale.\n\nThe earliest figures, from the 7th century, are \"rather simple and less well-executed than later ones\". The women are tall and slim, whereas by the mid-8th century a plumper figure had become the norm, with faces that are \"fat, heavily brooding and vacuous\". It has been suggested that this change in taste was provoked by the famous imperial concubine Yang Guifei, who had a full figure, although it seems to begin by about 725, when she was a child.\n\nThere may be groups of women as dancers or small seated orchestras of musicians, and some sitting figures appear to be beautifying themselves. More rarely, there are female riders and polo players, wearing male dress, which was usual for Tang women when riding, and apparently a fashion in the capital on other occasions. The period was one of unusual freedom for well-off women in China, and the figures reflect this.\n\nTang society, at least in Chang'an, the capital, was very cosmopolitan, and drew much of its prosperity from the Silk Road. Foreigners from further west seem to have been common as servants, in particular as grooms for horses and drivers of the camels which were the main form of transport on the overland Silk Road. Tang art liked to depict foreign figures, usually men, with standard characteristics for their faces and dress; Persian and Sogdian types can be distinguished, both with big bushy beards, and often fierce and vigorous expressions. Such figures sometimes contain clear elements of caricature.\n\nMale figures are often given more varied and active poses, and worked in more detail than those of women, but are harder to date as the changes in women's costume were not matched in male fashion. As well as many types of servants there are military officers in armour, officials, and sometimes foreign ambassadors. The function of the officials is to present the case for the deceased to the fierce judge of the afterlife.\n\nThe most common animals, and the most likely to be large and carefully modelled and decorated, are horses and camels. Both sorts range from animals without harness and saddlery to those with elaborately detailed trappings, and carrying riders or, in the case of camels, heavy loads of goods. At least two famous camels carry a small human orchestra. Dogs and farm animals, apart from some bulls at up to about 30 cm high, are more likely to be small and unglazed.\n\nAlong with guardian figures and officials, statues of horses are the main type of tomb figure that is also known in other media, such as gilt-bronze or stone, and some rich tombs also contain such figures in metal. The camels may sometimes belong to tombs of people rich from trade, but also seem to have been associated with wealth generally. They are often shown with heads raised and their mouths open, and in the finest models the shaggy areas at the neck and top of the legs are carefully textured in the clay. The horses are the \"heavenly horses\" from Ferghana in the west, which under the Tang dynasty were more common in China and ceased to be a highly prized rarity. These were also made in pottery under the Han dynasty; the Tang examples are more realistic, if perhaps less expressive.\n\nFour tomb guardians were standard in rich tombs, typically one at each corner: a pair each of \"earth spirits\" or \"zhenmushou\", and the \"lokapala\" or \"zhenmuyong\" warrior guardians. The figures are typically the largest and most elaborate in a tomb, and must often have been much the most difficult to model and fire. They are more likely to be glazed in \"sancai\", although many very elaborately made examples are not.\n\nThe figures may have been believed to protect the living by keeping the spirits of the dead from inappropriately roaming the world outside the tomb, as well as protecting the tomb from intrusions by robbers or spirits; the earth spirits were apparently associated with the first role, and the \"lokapala\" with the second.\n\nThe \"lokapala\" was also found above ground in Buddhist temples, in stone or wood. They seem to represent a merger of traditional Daoist guardians, dating back to the Han dynasty, and the Buddhist \"dvarapala\" or \"Heavenly Kings\", of which there were in theory four, though often only two were depicted in other Buddhist cultures. These too were shown as \"a fabulous crested semi-human being with bulging eyes, furiously gaping mouth and massive powerful arms and legs\". Whereas the Indian versions emphasized royal attributes, in China they were \"transformed into dynamic idealized generals\", with elaborate armour, often with added sprigged reliefs.\n\nIn the early part of the Tang their pose was less dramatic, standing with straight legs and holding a weapon (now usually lost) at rest. In the 8th century the elaborarate \"contrapposto\" poses were developed, typically with one foot higher than the other, as it rests on an animal or dwarfish conquered demon, and one arm held high, brandishing a weapon, while the other is bent and rests on the hip, in a pose combining fierceness and nonchalance.\n\nThe earth spirits are still more fantastic, with animal bodies, often including wings sprouting from the tops of the forelegs. The heads are often different, with one semi-human and another perhaps based on a snarling lion. Both have \"horns and crests like flames or huge cockscombs\", typically even larger in the lion-like type, while the semi-human type may have huge wide ears. Often the faces of the lion type are glazed, and the semi-human type not. Although mentioned in literature from the Han onwards, they only appear in art from the 6th century onwards, apparently developing from masks worn in the \"devil-clearing ceremony at the New Year.\n\nThere were also more conventional figures of snarling lions, relatively small and usually in \"'sancai\" glaze. Like the sets of zodiac figures, these continued after the Tang, which the elaborate \"earth spirits\" and \"lokapala\" did not.\n\nTang figures were not of much interest to traditional Chinese connoisseurs of pottery, and are still relatively little collected by Chinese collectors because they are made specifically for use in burials, and so considered unlucky; however they are popular exhibits in Chinese museums. They became extremely popular with Western collectors from about the 1910s, especially figures of horses, partly because they harmonized well with modern Western art and decor. By 1963, Gerald Reitlinger could write that \"no Mayfair flat is complete without a T'ang camel\". Prices, which peaked at a top level of about £600 a figure in the early 1920s, fell in the 1930s and 40s, but rose sharply in the 1960s, with a record auction price in 1969 of £16,000 for a horse.\n\nFrom about the late 1990s it was realized that there were large numbers of fakes on the market, and there was also an upsurge in new discoveries as construction in China boomed, and the market was hit by increased supply coinciding with a falling from fashion. For all these reasons, the figures have not shared in the huge increase in Chinese art prices since the 1990s, which has been driven by Chinese collectors. The record price for a horse remains £3,740,000, from a sale by the British Rail Pension Fund at Sotheby's in 1989. In 2002 the dealer who had sold this piece to the pension fund in the 1970s said that he thought that in 2002 it would be \"lucky\" to reach a price of £1 million.\n\n"}

He offers half his kingdom to any one of his sons who kills the Norka. The two eldest sons drink and revel instead of hunting the beast. The youngest third son, a simpleton, wounds and chases the beast. The beast escapes under a great stone. The third son descends to the underworld and meets a talking horse who calls him Ivan and takes him to a copper palace owned by a beautiful woman, a sister of the Norka. He travels to a silver palace and a golden palace, also owned by the sisters of the Norka. The third and youngest sister tells him that Norka is asleep on the sea. She gives him a sword and the Water of Strength, and tells him to cut off her brother's head with a single stroke. He cuts off the Norka's head, which says \"Well, I'm done for now!\", and rolls into the sea. \n\nThe three sisters are in love with him, so he takes them with him to the surface world. They change their palaces into eggs with magic, teach him how to do it, and give him the eggs. His brothers pull the three maidens up, but try to kill the third son by cutting the rope halfway up.

He covers some baby birds with his coat to protect them from the rain. The giant mother bird is grateful and carries him to the surface.\n\nA tailor tells him that the two princes are going to marry the maidens from the underworld, but the maidens refuse to be married until wedding dresses are made in the underworld style, and without measuring them. The third son tells the tailor to accept the job to make the clothes for the wedding.

He gives the dresses to the tailor who is paid richly by the King. He visits the shoemaker and other artificers and does the same thing. The youngest maiden recognizes him (in rags), grabs him, and takes him to the palace. She explains to the king what happened and that the brothers threatened to kill them if they said the third son was alive. The King punishes the two brothers. Three weddings are celebrated. \n\n"}

Published by Octagon Press in 1968, the book was re-released in paperback, ebook and audiobook editions by The Idries Shah Foundation in 2015.\n\nShortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, \"The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin\" can be read as part of a whole course of study.\n\nPart of a series of books, \"The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin\" is a collection of teaching stories, anecdotes and jokes drawn from Middle Eastern folklore and the Sufi mystical tradition, which feature the populist Middle Eastern philosopher and wise fool, Mulla Nasrudin.\n\nThousands of stories have been written around this popular folk character over the centuries, since his purported birth in the 13th century in what is now modern Turkey.\n\nDouglas Hill, Literary Editor of the socialist \"Tribune\" weekly magazine, wrote in 1969 that \"The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin\" contained “a great deal of timeless and universal wisdom made accessible and highly attractive with humour”, adding that “conventional responses and received frames of mind are challenged on every page.”\n\nIn \"The New York Times\", award-winning writer and later winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, Doris Lessing called \"The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin\" “perhaps the most shocking to our assumptions about ‘mysticism’” of Shah's books at the time. She said that this corpus of Nasrudin “jokes” was “deliberately created to inculcate Sufic thinking, to outwit The Old Villain, which is a name for the patterns of conditioned thinking which form the prison in which we all live.”\n\nIn an earlier review in \"The Observer\", Doris Lessing pointed out that most of the jokes in the book were new to the West; while others could also be found in the written work of Sufis like Rumi, Attar and Jami. She explained that “[Nasrudin's] antics are parallels of the mind's workings, designed to amuse the teahouses, but also for use on other levels”. As an example she refers to their use at an international scientific conference to illustrate problems in physics that were otherwise difficult or impossible to verbalise.\n\nNote: ISBNs refer to the original paperback editions, published by Octagon Press.

It was also known as the Salle des Machines, because of its elaborate stage machinery, designed by the Italian theatre architects Gaspare Vigarani and his two sons, Carlo and Lodovico. Constructed in 1659–1661, it was originally intended for spectacular productions mounted by the court of the young Louis XIV, but in 1763 the theatre was greatly reduced in size and used in turn by the Paris Opera (up to 1770), the Comédie-Française (from 1770 to 1782), and the Théâtre de Monsieur (from January to December 1789). In 1808 Napoleon had a new theatre/ballroom built to the designs of the architects Percier and Fontaine. The Tuileries Palace and the theatre were destroyed by fire on 24 May 1871, during the Paris Commune.\n\nThe auditorium, designed and decorated by the architects Charles Errard, Louis Le Vau, and François d'Orbay, was housed in a pavilion located at the north end of the palace as originally built by the architect Philibert de l'Orme for Catherine de Médicis. Estimates of its seating capacity range from 6,000 to 8,000. The unusually deep stage was located in a gallery situated between the auditorium and a new, more northern pavilion, later designated as the .\n\nThe hall was inaugurated on 7 February 1662 with the premiere of Cavalli's \"Ercole amante\". The costs of the project, including construction of the theatre, came to 120,000 \"livres\", yet the opera was only performed eight times. The theatre was not used again until January 1671, when \"Psyché\", a scenically spectacular play with music and ballet, was presented. This production cost 130,000 \"livres\" and was only performed twice. (\"Psyché\" was reduced in size and successfully revived at the smaller Théâtre du Palais-Royal in July.) The Salle des Machines was not used again for musical theatre during the remainder of Louis XIV's reign. In 1720, during the Regency of Louis XV, the hall was remodeled again, at a cost of nearly 150,000 livres, and the court ballet \"Les folies de Cardenio\" with music by Michel Richard Delalande was given. The young King Louis XV made his first and last appearance in a dancing role in this production. After \"Cardenio\" there were no further productions, except for some marionette shows in the 1730s. In view of the large expenditures on the theatre, it is surprising that it was so little used. Modern histories cite the poor acoustics, but Coeyman suggests that its disuse may have been the result of its large size: \"the hall may have simply been too hard to fill.\"\n\nThe theatre later underwent three substantial transformations: the first in 1763, when it was greatly reduced in size for the Paris Opera (to a capacity of 400 to 500 spectators) by the architects Jacques Soufflot and Jacques Gabriel; the second in 1792, when it was transformed into the hall of the National Convention; and the third in 1808, when Napoleon had a new theatre built to the designs of the architects Percier and Fontaine.\n\nNotes\nSources\n"}

It is one of ten western Massachusetts museums constituting the Museums10 consortium.\n\nThe Yiddish Book Center was founded in 1980 by Aaron Lansky, then a twenty-four-year-old graduate student of Yiddish literature and, , the center's president. In the course of his studies, Lansky realized that untold numbers of irreplaceable Yiddish books were being discarded by American-born Jews unable to read the language of their Yiddish-speaking parents and grandparents. He organized a nationwide network of \"zamlers\" (volunteer book collectors) and launched a campaign to save the world’s remaining Yiddish books. Lansky recounts the origins of the center in his 2004 memoir, \"Outwitting History\".\n\nAt the time Lansky began his work, scholars estimated there were 70,000 Yiddish books still extant and recoverable. Since then, the Yiddish Book Center has recovered more than a million volumes, and it continues to receive thousands of new books each year from around the world.\n\nIn 1997, the Yiddish Book Center moved to its current site in Amherst, Massachusetts, a 49,000-square-foot complex that echoes the rooflines of an East European \"shtetl\" (Jewish town). The center is home to permanent and traveling exhibits, a Yiddish book repository, educational programs, and the annual Yidstock: The Festival of New Yiddish Music.\n\nIn 2010, the organization dropped the initial word \"National\" from its name, and is currently known as \"Yiddish Book Center.\"\n\nBased on a score of 100, Charity Navigator rated the Yiddish Book Center 79.82% for its financials and 97% for accountability and transparency, resulting in an overall grade of 85.57.\n\nThe center has drawn on its duplicate holdings to distribute books to students and scholars, and to establish or strengthen collections at more than 700 research libraries, schools, and museums around the world.\n\nThe Yiddish Book Center includes a number of different collections: \n\nThe center offers public programs related to Yiddish and Jewish culture. Each year, the center hosts two visiting exhibits in its Brechner Gallery. It also has a number of permanent exhibits: the Lee & Alfred Hutt Discovery Gallery, an interactive exhibit on Jewish cultural identity; \"Unquiet Pages\" focused on Yiddish literature; \"A Living Connection: Photographs from the An-sky Expeditions, 1912-14\" on the work of ethnographer S. An-sky; \"Sholem-Bayes: Reflections on the American Jewish Home\"; the Nancy B. Weinstein, \"Kindervinkl\" (children's corner); the Appelbaum-Driker Theater, with exhibits on Yiddish film and radio; and a reproduction Yiddish Print Shop with displays about the Yiddish press in the twentieth century.\n\n\"Pakn Treger\" (Yiddish for \"book peddler\"), the magazine of the Yiddish Book Center, is an English-language magazine that covers subjects related to Yiddish culture and literature as well as news from the center. Its annual translation issue, a digital publication, features newly translated works of Yiddish literature.\n\nThe center's educational programs include the Steiner Summer Yiddish Program for college students, the Great Jewish Books Summer Program for high school students, a Great Jewish Books Teacher Workshop, a fellowship program, a translation fellowship, and Tent: Encounters with Jewish Culture, as well as online and on-site classes for adult learners, including YiddishSchool. The center also offers a field trip program for middle and high school students.\n\nIn 2001, Ruthe B. Cowl (1912–2008) of Laredo, Texas, donated $1 million to create the Jack and Ruthe B. Cowl Center, which promotes \"Yiddish literary, artistic, musical, and historical knowledge and accomplishment\" at the center. Early in 2007, Cowl donated another $750,000 to create the Cowl Jewish Leadership Program for promising college students.\n\nIn 2013, the center launched a translation effort that includes a translation fellowship program; a publishing venture; Taytsh.org, a website and interactive resource for working Yiddish-to-English translators; and an annual digital \"Pakn Treger\" translation anthology.\n\n"}
