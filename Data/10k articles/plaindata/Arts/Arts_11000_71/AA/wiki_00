Alex Sichel received a grant from the Princess Grace Foundation to make a film about the riot grrrl music scene and then asked her sister to collaborate with her.\n\nThe soundtrack featured musicians and bands such as Ani DiFranco, Sleater-Kinney, Babes in Toyland and many more.\n\nThis film focuses on Claude (Alison Folland), a teenage girl who lives in Hell's Kitchen, New York City, and is the story of her sexual discovery and budding lesbianism during summer vacation. Claude's best friend is Ellen (Tara Subkoff). Her plan to start a band with Ellen is subverted when Ellen begins dating Mark (Cole Hauser).\n\nClaude discovers that Luke (Pat Briggs), a gay musician who has just moved into her apartment building, has been stabbed to death in what might have been a hate crime. Ellen hints at the fact that she was there when Luke was killed, but Claude keeps her mouth shut in order to protect her. Claude then goes to a gay bar and meets Lucy (Leisha Hailey), a pink-haired guitarist who is playing in the house band. Claude goes to Lucy's apartment, but freaks out and leaves, returning to her apartment to find Ellen waiting for her. They have a fight which ends with Claude screaming that she would die without Ellen.\n\nClaude goes out along with Ellen and Mark on one of their dates; Mark gives Ellen downers which make her violently ill. Claude brings her to the bathroom and forces her to vomit, and Ellen refers to Claude as her \"Knight in Shining Armor.\" Mark is visibly furious but manages to contain himself. Claude leaves and goes to Lucy's apartment again, but leaves after a brief make-out session. On the way home, Claude is ambushed in the street by Mark, who questions her relationship with Ellen. Claude threatens to tell the police about Mark's possible involvement in Luke's death due in large part that she is worried that he is leading Ellen down a dark path.\n\nClaude goes home to find Ellen waiting for her. Claude tells her that they need to tell the police about Mark, but Ellen says she would go to jail if they knew about her involvement. Claude says she would never let that happen. Claude kisses Ellen and tells her that she loves her. Ellen tells Claude not to say that, and Claude leaves. The next day, Claude cleans out her room, removing all traces of Ellen. She goes to the police before work. Later, the police comes into her workplace and takes Mark away for questioning. Ellen tells Claude that she hates her. Claude says that she knows, and that she's sorry. Claude then starts seeing Lucy.\n\n\nThe MPAA gave \"All Over Me\" an R rating for sexuality and drug use involving teen girls, and for strong language. The film premiered at the 1997 Berlin International Film Festival where it played in the Panorama section. It went on to show at several festivals including the 1997 Turin International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and the 1998 Lisbon Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. It opened in American theaters on April 25, 1997 distributed by Fine Line Features. It was released in Australian theaters on February 19, 1998. It was released onto Region 1 DVD on June 14, 2005 distributed by Image Entertainment. It was released on Region 2 DVD on April 8, 2002 distributed by Millivres Multimedia.\n\nCritical response to \"All Over Me\" was generally positive. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a \"fresh\" rating of 84% based on 25 reviews. Critics were impressed with this directorial debut and described it as powerful and conspicuously well-made. They praised the Sichel sisters for telling a story of adolescence and friendship which is at once honest, realistic and authentic, while remaining subtle, subdued and compassionate. Emanuel Levy called it complex and interesting, and Marjorie Baumgarten called it a film for \"riot grrrls of all ages\". Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" praised it as a confident first feature but said that it has more style than substance. Its detractors included Don Willmot, who found it melodramatic, and \"E!\", which described it as titillating but contrived; \"a walk on the mild side\".\n\nAlison Folland was widely praised by critics for her performance as Claude. Emanuel Levy called her an instinctive actress who \"dominates every frame of the picture\". Janet Maslin said Folland brings a \"wistful sincerity\" to the role. Tara Subkoff was also praised for a performance compared by some to Rosanna Arquette. Not all the critics liked her portrayal of Ellen; \"E!\" called her \"merely grating\".\n\nWith its coming-of-age theme and exploration of teenage sexuality, \"All Over Me\" drew comparisons from critics to other films, in particular Larry Clark's \"Kids\" and Maria Maggenti's \"The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love\", both from 1995. Although similarities were noted, \"All Over Me\" was praised for its differences to these two films. \"E!\" called it gentler than \"Kids\", and Muskewitz said \"All Over Me\" was less exploitative than that film. Emanual Levy described it as the far more interesting and complex of the two. Ron Wells said \"thank god it's not \"Kids\"\" and Bernstein said that \"comparison misses the point\". When comparing it to \"The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love\", Emanuel Levy called \"All Over Me\" \"much more accomplished\". SplicedWire called it \" an ideal companion feature for Todd Solondz's \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\", another female-centred coming-of-age film from the mid-1990s.\n\n\"All Over Me\" won the Teddy Award for Best Feature Film at the 1997 Berlin International Film Festival. It was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, the Open Palm Award at the 1997 Gotham Awards and the Outstanding Film (Limited Release) Award at the 1998 GLAAD Media Awards. Alison Folland was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead.\n\nThe film score for \"All Over me\" was composed by Miki Navazio. The soundtrack to the film was released on the TVT label on April 29, 1997. It features songs from several indie and riot grrl musicians interspersed with parts of Navazio's score.\n\n\n\n"}

Kay between 1999 and 2002.\n\nStrong, intelligent and loyal to her friends, Anna Green went through a tough time in Hollyoaks. Anna arrived in Hollyoaks with her friends Sam Smallwood, Geri Hudson, Alex Bell and Nikki Sullivan. Anna was immediately shocked to discover that her father had been having an affair and it had become front page news because he was a vicar. Sam comforted her over her father’s affair and ended up kissing Anna, as the pair went on to date from there. However, Anna was surprised when Sam accidentally sent a text to Anna revealing that he had spent the night with Nikki. Anna ended up dumping Sam, but was heartbroken when Sam and Nikki made a fresh start together away from Hollyoaks.\n\nAnna was then knocked over by Cindy Cunningham’s car, but was taken to the hospital, where she made a full recovery. Alex was upset that he was infertile and told Anna, and Anna confided it to Geri Hudson who ended up spreading it around Hollyoaks. Alex was upset and took his anger out on Anna and Alex soon realised how bad he had been to Anna. Anna accepted Alex’s apology and the pair finally got back together. However, Anna was shocked when she discovered that she was pregnant, despite believing that Alex was infertile. When Anna told Alex, Alex refused to believe her and accused Anna of being unfaithful. Anna forced Alex to do a second test, and when he did, the hospital admitted to making a mistake and Alex was in fact fertile after all. Alex apologised to Anna, but told her that he did not want the baby and he then offered her money to have an abortion. Anna was left confused and without much support, she had to make a tough decision. Anna decided in the end that she couldn't go through with an abortion, so she decided that when the child was born she would give it up for adoption.\n\nDuring New Year’s day, Anna gave birth to her child with support from Max Cunningham and Alex, who realised that he wanted to keep the baby. Anna was finally persuaded by Alex to keep the baby, and Alex named him Charlie and they tried to take steps towards life as a family. However, Anna tried to work on her relationship with Alex, but she felt that she couldn't love him any longer and she ended up sleeping with Max. With a guilty conscience, Anna confessed to Alex, and she decided to move in with the Cunningham family with Charlie, despite Alex trying to persuade her to give their relationship another chance. Anna and Max both agreed that they were serious about their relationship and Anna rejected Alex when he asked her to marry him. Anna then had a night out with Max, leaving Alex to baby-sit Charlie, but when the pair returned to collect Charlie from Alex’s flat, Anna realised that Alex was taking Charlie away with him to Hong Kong. Anna made a mad dash to the airport, just in time to catch Alex, and she managed to persuade him to give Charlie back to her. With Alex leaving Hollyoaks for Hong Kong, Anna thought she could build up her relationship with Max by buying a flat together. However, Max shocked Anna when he revealed that he had had far too much responsibility and was not yet ready for commitment. Anna had nothing left in Hollyoaks and decided to leave by going back to her mother's house.\n\nLorna Cooper of MSN TV listed Anna as one of soap opera's \"forgotten characters\".\n"}

The entire pattern is created in such a way that its highest point is lower than the surrounding metal. A translucent enamel is then applied to the metal, allowing light to reflect from the relief and creating an artistic effect. It was used in the late Middle Ages, and then again in the 17th century.\n\nThe technique had been known to the Ancient Romans, but was lost at the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century. Translucent enamel is more fragile than opaque, and medieval survivals in good condition are very rare. Medieval examples begin in Italy in the 13th century, with the earliest dated work being a chalice by the Sienese goldsmith Guccio di Mannaia, made for Pope Nicholas IV about 1290, which is part of the collection of the Treasure Museum of the basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi. \n\nThe technique then spread to other centres for high-quality courtly work, at a time when the champlevé enamels associated above all with Limoges had become almost mass-produced and relatively cheap. It is generally agreed that the late 14th century Royal Gold Cup, now in the British Museum, is the outstanding surviving example of \"basse taille\" enamel. It is one of only four known survivals done on gold, including both secular or religious pieces; another is the small Salting Reliquary, also in the British Museum. The \"King John Cup\" in King's Lynn, of ca. 1340, silver-gilt with transparent enamel, is the best example of \"basse-taille\" work probably made in England; the metalwork expert Herbert Maryon describes this and the Royal Gold Cup as the \"two examples of outstanding merit, unsurpassed in any collection\". However it is unclear if most of the enamel at King's Lynn is original. \n\nThe technique was rediscovered in the 17th century, but was not much practiced thereafter. In a variant of the technique, translucent enamel was applied over a guilloché machine-turned metal backing by Peter Carl Fabergé on the Faberge eggs and other pieces from the 1880s until the Russian Revolution, and this technique is still used, usually in a single colour.\n\nThe revived technique was used in the 17th century for the covers and faces of pocket watches, gold boxes and similar items, but mostly with opaque enamel, achieving a rather different effect from medieval examples using translucent enamel. The French watchmaker Josias Jolly made frequent use of it.\n\nThe process for creating \"basse-taille\" enamel began by marking the outline of the design and the main internal outlines on the gold with a tool called a \"tracer\". Then the interior area was worked, either with chasing tools, hammering and punching rather than cutting, or with chisels, to form a shallow recess to hold the enamel. The more important parts of the design were modelled by varying the depth of the surface to produce different intensities of colour when the translucent enamel was added; for example in the Royal Gold Cup the gold under folds of drapery often rises near the surface to create a paler highlight. In the example illustrated with Luke's ox the lowest lobe shows tufts of grass formed by cutting deeper into the background. In many of the recessed areas further decoration was added by either engraving or punching which would show through the translucent enamel, or to facet the background so the reflections change as the viewing angle changes slightly. Most background areas to the enamelled scenes were decorated in the same way. Finally the surfaces were cleaned up, made good and polished, perhaps including scraping off any bumps showing through on the reverse of the metal.\n\nThe enamel lies flush with the gold surfaces; it was a preparation of finely ground glass paste applied with great care to the prepared recessed areas, and then fired. When different colours of enamel meet each other with a neat boundary, this was achieved by firing one colour with a retaining border of gum tragacanth before adding the next. The difficulty was often increased by the application of tints of a different colour to a base shade of enamel before firing, so that the added colour blends gradually into the background colour around the edges of the tinted area. This is especially used on \"flux\", or colourless enamel, as in the ground areas, rocks and trees. In the Royal Gold Cup, flux was also used for flesh areas as on a gold background it darkens slightly when hard to a suitable colour for skin. The \"rouge clair\" or \"ruby glass\" red, used so effectively here, was made by adding tiny particles of copper, silver and gold to the glass; here scientific tests have shown that copper was used. After firing the enamel was polished flush with the surrounding metal, which was presumably decorated last.\n\n"}
{"id": "26021687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26021687", "title": "Biographical fallacy", "text": "Biographical fallacy\n\nThe biographical fallacy is a term used in cultural criticism to critique the view that works of creative art, literature or music can be interpreted as reflections of the life of their authors. Along with the intentional fallacy, the term was introduced by exponents of the New Criticism who wished to emphasise that artworks should be interpreted and assessed as constructed artifacts rather than expressions of the emotions of specific individuals. The term is thus used to criticize the school of literary interpretation called Biographical criticism.\n\nThe argument arose from the increasing tendency of critics during the 19th century to view artworks in terms of the life experiences of their creators, whether their personal lives, or the wider historical conditions represented in the artist's world view, a claim associated with critics such as Hippolyte Taine.\n\nThis position was referred to as a \"fallacy\" on the grounds that it neglected both the purely imaginative aspects of the arts and their reliance on formal conventions and rules of genre. Thus James M. Thomas writes of the fallacy applied to drama that,\n\nThis type of approach distances itself from the play and goes instead into the playwright's biography to find people, places and things that seem to be similar to features in the play. And then it claims that the play is actually a picture of these people, places and things. In its extreme form this is fallacy because it does not consider that playwrights use their imagination when they write and that they can imagine improbable or even impossible things.\n\nRobert S. Miola, Professor of English at Loyola College in Maryland, discusses the biographical fallacy as \"the unqualified conviction that one can read the author's life from the work and vice versa\", and adds:\n\nThis fallacy is widespread in Shakespeare studies, true enough, but the business of wrenching passages out of dramatic context as evidence of the playwright's personal beliefs usually reveals more about the critic than about Shakespeare. \n\nCommenting further on the fallacy as applied to contemporary work about Shakespeare, Joseph Pearce asserts that \"For the proponents of ‘queer theory' he becomes conveniently homosexual; for secular fundamentalists he is a proto-secularist, ahead of his time; for ‘post-Christian' agnostics he becomes a prophet of modernity.” \n\nOthers consider the term offensive and defend biographical criticism in its non-extreme forms, finding that full understanding of an author's works is not possible without extrinsic sources. Leon Edel in his book \"Literary Biography\" devoted a chapter to defending biographical criticism. While admitting the excesses of certain earlier critics use of biography, he rigorously stated that \"no critic, I hold, can explicatethe very word implies thisanything without alluding to something else [outside the work].\"\n\nThe term inverted autobiography is also applied to the practice.\n"}

Roy Moore. It stars Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder, Andrea Martin, Marian Waldman and John Saxon. The story concerns a group of sorority sisters who receive threatening phone calls and are eventually stalked and murdered by a deranged killer during the Christmas season. \n\nInspired by the urban legend \"The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs\" and a series of murders that took place in the Westmount section of Montreal, Quebec, Moore wrote the screenplay under the title \"Stop Me\". The filmmakers made numerous alterations to the script, primarily the shifting to a university setting with young adult characters. It was shot in Toronto in 1974 on an estimated budget of $620,000, and was distributed by Warner Bros. in North America.\n\n\"Black Christmas\" was released on October 11, 1974 in Canada, and December 20 in the United States under the title \"Silent Night, Evil Night\". It has received critical praise, with film historians noting it for being one of the earliest slasher films to conclude without revealing the identity of its villain, as well as serving as an influence on John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" (1978). Aside from earning a cult following since its release, a novelization written by Lee Hays was published in 1976, and a remake of the same name, produced by Clark and directed by Glen Morgan, was released in December 2006.\n\nAn unseen and disoriented man climbs up into the attic of a sorority house, where the tenants are celebrating with a Christmas party. One of the girls, Jess, answers an obscene phone call from a mentally unstable man who is implied to call the house regularly. She summons her fellow students into the room, where they listen as the caller screams and curses them on the phone. When one of the girls, foul-mouthed Barb, takes the phone from Jess, she incites the caller, who in turn promises to kill her. Barb argues with a younger student, Clare Harrison, who implies that the caller could be a serial rapist, before Clare returns to her bedroom to finish packing for Christmas break. The disoriented man lures Clare into her closet, where he suffocates her with a plastic dress bag. He moves her body to the attic. \n\nThe following morning, Mr. Harrison arrives at the school to pick up his daughter, but she fails to show up to their agreed meeting place. He quickly makes his way to the sorority house, where the housemother, Mrs. MacHenry, is surprised by Clare's absence. Meanwhile, Jess meets her boyfriend, Peter, a neurotic music student. She explains she is pregnant and planning to get an abortion, angering Peter, who attempts to intimidate her. In town, Mr. Harrison, accompanied by Barb and one of the other girls, Phyllis Carlson, attempt to report Clare as missing, while Jess quickly tells Clare's boyfriend Chris about Clare's sudden disappearance. They learn that another local girl named Janis Quaife has also seemingly vanished while walking home from school. \n\nAfter putting a drunken Barb to bed, Mr. Harrison, Chris, Jess, and Phyllis help search for Janis in a nearby park where she allegedly disappeared, hoping to turn up some sign of Clare. Meanwhile, Mrs. Mac plans to leave for her sister's home, only to be lured up into the attic, where she discovers Clare's body. The killer throws a crane hook into her face, hanging and killing her. In the park, Janis's disfigured body is found by the police and Jess returns home, while the search continues for Clare. She answers another obscene phone call and decides to file a report with the police, only for Peter to appear and surprise her. He attempts to persuade her into marriage for the sake of their child, but Jess adamantly refuses. Peter leaves in an emotional state, while Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller arrives to bug the telephone. \n\nA group of choir children arrive on the house's stoop to sing Christmas carols, distracting Jess. The killer enters Barb's room and murders her with a glass figurine; Barb's cries for help are drowned out by the singing children. One of the women in charge of the children ushers them away, having learned of Janis's murder. Jess experiences another unnerving phone call, in which the caller restates part of her argument with Peter. Lieutenant Fuller theorizes that Peter could be responsible, due to the caller's knowledge of the argument and his own mental fragility, but Jess doubts this. Moments later, Phyllis enters Barb's room and is ambushed by the killer, who murders her off-screen. \n\nJess gets another obscene phone call, in which the killer alludes to some sort of transgression between two children named Agnes and Billy. The call is long enough to be traced by Graham, a telephone company employee, and Sergeant Nash instructs Jess to leave the house immediately. Concerned for Barb and Phyllis, Jess arms herself with a poker and ventures upstairs, where she discovers Barb and Phyllis's maimed figures. The killer appears and pursues Jess through the house; Jess locks herself in the cellar, only for Peter to appear outside one of the windows. He smashes the window to get to Jess, who proceeds to bludgeon him with the poker, assuming he is the killer. \n\nThe police arrive moments later, alerted by Jess's screams. They discover her barely conscious in the basement, with Peter's bloody remains next to her. They put Jess to bed and discuss the murders, unaware of Clare and Mrs. MacHenry's bodies still in the attic. Jess is left in the house to rest, with a policeman standing outside. The killer climbs down from the attic as Jess sleeps in a nearby room. The house's telephone begins to ring, leaving Jess's fate unknown as the credits roll.\n\n\nCanadian Roy Moore wrote the screenplay entitled \"Stop Me\" based on \"The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs\" urban legend. Moore also claimed to have been inspired by a series of murders that occurred during the holiday season in the Westmount area of Montreal.\n\nFilm producers Harvey Sherman and Richard Schouten had Timothy Bond rewrite the script to give it a university setting. Clark, who had felt the original script was too much of a straightforward slasher film, made several alterations in dialogue, and also incorporated humorous elements into the film, particularly the drunkenness of Barb, and Mrs. Mac, who Clark based on his aunt. Clark felt that college and high school students had not been depicted with \"any sense of reality\" in American film, and that he intended to capture the \"astuteness\" of young adults: \"College students—even in 1974—are astute people. They're not fools. It's not all \"bikinis, beach blankets, [and] bingo\".\"\n\nOlivia Hussey, who had previously garnered international fame for her role as Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1968), signed on to appear in the film after being told by a psychic that she would \"make a film in Canada that would earn a great deal of money.\" Clark sought Keir Dullea to play the role of Peter based on his performance as Dave Bowman in \"\" (1968). The role of Mrs. Mac was offered to Bette Davis, who declined the part. Margot Kidder was cast in the role of Barb, and said she had been attracted to the character \"because she was wild and out of control\", and not a \"conventional leading\" part.\n\nGilda Radner was offered the role of Phyllis Carlson; she accepted the part, but dropped out one month before filming began owing to \"Saturday Night Live\" commitments, and was replaced by Andrea Martin. The role of Lieutenant Fuller was originally given to Edmond O'Brien. Upon his arrival to the set, however, the producers realized he would be unable to fulfill the duties required of the part due to his failing health (stemming from Alzheimer's disease). John Saxon, who had read the script prior, was called by the producers who offered him the role; he accepted, and had to arrive in Toronto from New York City within two days to begin shooting.\n\n\"Black Christmas\" was shot on location in Toronto in the winter of 1973–74; the house featured in the film had been discovered by Clark while scouting for locations, and its owners agreed to lease the home for the production. Additional photography was completed on the University of Toronto campus. According to John Saxon, Clark had meticulously drawn out storyboards with key shots, which he brought to the film set each day: \"I could understand exactly what I thought he needed, and the scene needed.\"\n\nMargot Kidder remembers making the film was \"fun. I really bonded with Andrea Martin, filming in Toronto and Ontario. Olivia Hussey was a bit of an odd one. She was obsessed with the idea of falling in love with Paul McCartney through her psychic. We were a little hard on her for things like that.\"\n\nThe composer of the film's score, Carl Zittrer, stated in an interview that he created the film's mysterious music by tying forks, combs, and knives onto the strings of the piano to warp the sound of the keys. Zittrer also stated that he would distort the sound further by recording its sound onto an audio tape and make the sound slower. The audio for the disturbing phone calls was performed by multiple actors including actor Nick Mancuso and director Bob Clark. Mancuso stated in an interview that he stood on his head during the recording sessions to compress his thorax and make his voice sound more demented.\n\nDuring preparation in 1975 for the film's American release, Warner Bros. studio executives asked Clark to change the concluding scene to show Clare's boyfriend, Chris, appear in front of Jess and say, \"Agnes, don't tell them what we did\" before killing her; however, Clark insisted on keeping the ending ambiguous. The original title of the film was initially planned to be \"Stop Me\". Clark has stated in an interview that he came up with the film's official title, saying that he enjoyed the irony of a dark event occurring during a festive holiday. According to Clark as well, Warner Bros. changed the title to \"Silent Night, Evil Night\", for the United States theatrical release.\n\n\"Black Christmas\" was officially released on October 11, 1974, in Canada through Ambassador Film Distributors. In the United States, Warner Bros. released the film in tandem with the Christmas season on December 20, 1974. For the American release, Warner Bros. initially changed the title to \"Silent Night, Evil Night\", worried that the original title would mislead audiences into believing the film was a blaxploitation movie. They retracted the title after the initial release, restoring it to \"Black Christmas\" for subsequent screenings.\n\nThe film later screened in October 1975 in New York City and Chicago, as well as 19 theaters in Los Angeles, where it generated considerable ticket sales. This prompted Warner Bros. to expand the release to a total of 70 theaters nationwide in time for Halloween, but the film only generated a daily average of $700 per theater, per day, after which Warner Bros. withdrew the film from circulation in December. The film had previously screened under the alternate title \"Silent Night, Evil Night\" in Virginia in July 1975.\n\nOverall, \"Black Christmas\" grossed over $4,053,000 internationally, managing to earn more than its budget of $620,000. When released in the UK, the BBFC had the word \"cunt\" removed, as well as several other crude and sexual references during the first obscene phone call.\n\nThe film, under the title \"Stranger in the House\", was set to make its network television premiere on Saturday night, January 28, 1978, on NBC's weekly \"Saturday Night at the Movies\". Two weeks prior to its premiere, the Chi Omega Sorority House on the campus of Florida State University in Tallahassee was the scene of a double murder in which two Chi Omega sisters, asleep in their beds, were bludgeoned to death. The killer then went to a nearby room in the sorority house and violently attacked two more sleeping co-eds, who survived. The killer was later identified as Ted Bundy, who was executed for this and other homicides on January 24, 1989.\n\nA few days before the movie was set to premiere on network television Florida's then-Governor Reubin Askew contacted NBC President Robert Mullholland to request the movie not be shown due to its all-too-similar theme as the murders of sorority sisters by an unknown madman at the Chi Omega Sorority House. On Tuesday, January 24, NBC-TV gave several of its affiliates in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama, the option of showing an alternate movie, \"\", in place of \"Stranger in the House.\".\"\n\n\"The network said in a statement issued yesterday in New York City that it was responding to concern voiced by the affiliates because of the murder of two coeds this month in a sorority house at Florida State University in Tallahassee.\"\n\n\"Black Christmas\" has been released on DVD several times in North America. A 25th Anniversary edition was released in Canada on November 6, 2001 by Critical Mass. This edition only contains the theatrical trailer as a bonus feature. The following year, on December 3, 2002, Critical Mass released a Collector's Edition of the film on DVD with making-of documentaries, two audio commentary tracks, and reversible English and French cover artwork.\n\nOn December 5, 2006, Critical Mass released a third \"Special Edition\" DVD with a newly remastered transfer, two original scenes with newly-uncovered vocal tracks, a new documentary on the making of the film, and cast and crew interviews. This edition was later released on Blu-ray on November 11, 2008.\n\nSoon after the film's 40th anniversary, Anchor Bay released a Blu-ray and DVD in Canada, titled the \"Season's Grievings Edition\". It contains the same transfer of the film as the \"Special Edition\" release and all previous bonus content, plus the addition of: a new documentary (\"Black Christmas Legacy\"), a 40th anniversary panel from Fan Expo 2014, a new commentary track featuring Nick Mancuso as the character \"Billy\", a new retrospective booklet written by Rue Morgue Magazine, and new packaging art by Gary Pullin (art director of Rue Morgue Magazine). This new edition was released on Blu-ray and DVD on November 24, 2015.\n\nIn the United States, Scream Factory released the film in a collector's edition Blu-ray on December 13, 2016 with a new transfer and new extras. The Scream Factory release collates all of the bonus materials from the previous releases by Critical Mass and Anchor Bay, and also features the 2006 Critical Mass restoration of the film in the bonus materials.\n\nDuring its initial release, the film had garnered mixed reviews. A writer for \"The New York Times\" scored the film a 1 out of 5, calling it \"a whodunit that raises the question as to why was it made.\" \"Variety\" called the film \"a bloody, senseless kill-for-kicks feature, [that] exploits unnecessary violence in a university sorority house operated by an implausibly alcoholic ex-hoofer. Its slow-paced, murky tale involves an obscene telephone caller who apparently delights in killing the girls off one by one, even the hapless house-mother.\"\n\nAccording to review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it currently holds a 70% approval rating, based on 30 reviews, with the consensus reading: \"The rare slasher with enough intelligence to wind up the tension between bloody outbursts, \"Black Christmas\" offers fiendishly enjoyable holiday viewing for genre fans.\" Heidi Martinuzzi of \"Film Threat\" called the film \"innovative\" and praised the leading actresses, Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder. \"TV Guide\" awarded the film three out of four stars, writing: \"Although strictly standard fare, the material is elevated somewhat through Clark's skillful handling of such plot devices as obscene phone calls from the killer to the girls via the upstairs phone and a nicely handled twist ending, which provides a genuine shock.\"\nAuthor and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film his usual two and a half out of a possible four stars (his most frequently given rating) calling it \"bizarre\" but also praised Kidder's performance as a standout. The \"Time Out\" film guide noted that the film \"manages a good slice of old-fashioned suspense.\"\n\nAcademy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films\n\nCanadian Film Awards\n\nEdgar Allan Poe Awards\n\nThe film eventually gained a cult following and is notable for being one of the earliest slasher films. It went on to inspire other slasher films, the biggest being John Carpenter's \"Halloween\" (which was apparently inspired by Clark suggesting what a \"Black Christmas\" sequel would be like). The film ranked No. 87 on \"Bravo\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"The 100 Scariest Movie Moments\". Olivia Hussey told Bravo during an interview about their 100 Scariest Movie Moments series, that when she met Steve Martin for the first time, he told her she starred in his favorite movie of all time. Hussey initially thought he was referring to \"Romeo and Juliet\" but was surprised when Martin said it was \"Black Christmas\" and that he had seen the film 27 times.\n\nThe film has been assessed in feminist film theory, with viewers arguing that the female-led cast, presence of casual sexual activity, and plot elements of obscene phone calls and abortion provide feminist subtext.\n\nA novelization of the film written by Lee Hays was published in 1976 by Popular Library.\n\nA remake of the film, directed by Glen Morgan, was released on December 25, 2006. It is loosely based on the original film, containing more graphic content and a focus into the past of Billy. Andrea Martin was the only original cast member to appear in the film. Bob Clark served as an executive producer.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22389870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22389870", "title": "Brooch of Lorn", "text": "Brooch of Lorn\n\nThe Brooch of Lorn or \"Braìste Lathurna\" in Gaelic, is a medieval \"turreted\" disk brooch that was supposedly taken from Robert the Bruce (Robert I of Scotland) at the Battle of Dalrigh in 1306. However the brooch is today dated long after this period. The brooch is centred on a large quartz charmstone, and it is not implausible that this stone had belonged to the Bruce; the brooch also acted as a reliquary. The brooch is owned by the MacDougall of Dunollie Preservation Trust. It was rarely seen in public until it was loaned to an exhibition in the British Museum in London in 2012.\n\nThe brooch is one of three West Highland 16th-century silver turreted brooches centred on charmstones, though the brooches are thought to be resettings of stones which already had reputations. The others are the Lochbuy or Lochbuie Brooch in the British Museum, and the Ugadale or Lossit Brooch, also still in private hands. All three were exhibited together in the British Museum's exhibition \"\" in 2012. In the following months a replica made in recent years was exhibited in six local libraries in Argyll.\n\nThe silver disc at the back of the brooch is about 4.5 inches across, and the brooch is secured by a hinged pin (a later replacement) and catch behind it. Underneath the central stone is an empty compartment (said in 1905 to contain fragments of human bone), probably designed to hold a relic; the stone is set well above the base disc, and is surrounded by eight detached \"chatons\" or turrets, about 1.25 inches high, and each topped by a Scottish freshwater pearl. There is \"a profusion of filigree work in the form of stellate \"appliqué\" ornaments and cabled borders\". The style of decoration appears influenced by European workshops, and the brooch lacks the post-Insular motifs seen in the Lochbuie Brooch, and other late medieval West Highland objects in various media. The use of \"turrets\" as decoration was popular in late medieval jewellery, but usually in far less elaborate forms, with brooches having a number of small projecting turrets around a ring forming the brooch.\n\nThe dating of the Brooch of Lorn varies somewhat, though all contemporary specialists are clear that it is from well after Robert the Bruce's lifetime. The British Museum describes it as \"dated on stylistic grounds to late 16th C but incorporating earlier rock crystal charmstones in which there was revived interest in the 16th C.\", and dates its own Lochbuie Brooch, which it believes was by the same hand, to \"1600 (circa)\". David Caldwell, curator of the Scottish medieval collections at the National Museums of Scotland, is quoted as saying, \"It is a very important piece of west Highland art, but it dates from the mid 15th century, so cannot be Bruce’s. Maybe the original brooch fell to pieces and this one was substituted for it\". Findlay in 1999 preferred the earlier part of the 16th century, and Catherine Gillies, curator for the clan, says, \"The re-setting has been narrowed by style and historiography to roughly the third quarter of the 16th century\", but still uses the description \"medieval\".\n\nIn 1306 the Battle of Dalrigh took place where Robert the Bruce of Scotland was ambushed by John of Argyll, chief of the Clan MacDougall. The attack was revenge for the murder of John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, a nephew of John of Argyll and rival for the throne of Scotland. According to tradition, the attackers tried to dismount Robert the Bruce but only pulled off his cloak and brooch. The brooch was kept at Dunollie Castle until being moved to Gylen Castle on the island of Kerrera during the Covenanter Wars. The castle was captured and burned by David Leslie, Lord Newark in 1647 and the brooch was taken.\n\nIt was hidden until the early 19th century when it was found in a chest by Major Campbell of Bragleen after his return from fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. A document confirmed that it had been taken from Gylen Castle by the Campbells, and it was viewed by the MacDougall chief before Major Campbell's death in 1819. It was returned to the MacDougall in 1824 by General Duncan Campbell of Lochnell. Queen Victoria viewed the brooch during a visit with the MacDougall clan chief in 1842, taking it in her hand and examining it closely.\n\nOne rare appearance in public was when the MacDougal chief wore it when Elizabeth II visited Oban in 1956.\n\nThe \"Broach of Lorn\" was the subject of sections XI-XIII of the second canto of \"The Lord of the Isles\", a poem by Sir Walter Scott (1815), although as he was writing at a point when no one had seen the brooch for over a century, and it was believed to be lost, his description was not very accurate, calling the brooch gold for example:\n\n\n"}

It was the place of Notker's tomb. The church was suppressed in 1797 during the French Revolution, the building being confiscated and sold in 1798.\n\nOn 23 March 1879, Pope Leo XIII canonically crowned the statue of Saint Joseph within this shrine, in honor of the 200th anniversary of the request by King Charles II of Spain to Pope Innocent XI to consecrate Belgium to Saint Joseph. The coronation feast also coincided with the 203rd anniversary of Diocese of Liege by request of Emperor Leopold I in 1676 and approved by Pope Clement X. The image was consequently lost to history during the First World War, it’s whereabouts unknown. The notarized Pontifical decree was received by Bishop of Liege, Victor Doutreloux. \n\nOriginally an octagonal building in Mosan Romanesque style, incorporating elements of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the church was completely rebuilt in a late Baroque style in 1754–1784. It has been in use as a parish church since 1809, and has been listed as a monument since 1952.\nThe church maintained a library from 1388. \n\nThe Renaissance composer Johannes Brassart was closely associated with the church.\n\n"}
{"id": "938586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=938586", "title": "Creativity techniques", "text": "Creativity techniques\n\nCreativity techniques are methods that encourage creative actions, whether in the arts or sciences. They focus on a variety of aspects of creativity, including techniques for idea generation and divergent thinking, methods of re-framing problems, changes in the affective environment and so on. They can be used as part of problem solving, artistic expression, or therapy.\n\nSome techniques require groups of two or more people while other techniques can be accomplished alone. These methods include word games, written exercises and different types of improvisation, or algorithms for approaching problems. Aleatory techniques exploiting randomness are also common.\n\nAleatoricism is the incorporation of chance (random elements) into the process of creation, especially the creation of art or media. Aleatoricism is commonly found in music, art, and literature, particularly in poetry. In film, Andy Voda made a movie in 1979 called \"Chance Chants\", which he produced by a flip of a coin or roll of a die. In music, John Cage, an avant-garde musician, composed music by using the \"I Ching\" to determine the position of musical notes, superimposing star maps on blank sheet music, by rolling dice and preparing open-ended scores that depended on the spontaneous decisions of the performers. (1) Other ways of practicing randomness include coin tossing, picking something out of a hat, or selecting random words from a dictionary. \n\nThe aleatory approach is also demonstrated in the case of the process called provocation, which was initially introduced by Edward de Bono as an aid to research. This method, which Richard Restak said was also employed by Anthony Burgess, aims to achieve novel ideas in writing by directing a plot with creative connections through random words picked from a reference book. Restak explained that the two hundred billion interconnected neural cells in the brain are capable of an abundance of possibilities for long-range connections and creative interactions using random and unrelated words.\n\nIn short, aleatoricism is a way to introduce new thoughts or ideas into a creative process.\n\nImprovisation is a creative process which can be spoken, written, or composed without prior preparation.\nImprovisation, also called extemporization, can lead to the discovery of new ways to act, new patterns of thought and practices, or new structures. Improvisation is used in the creation of music, theater, and other various forms. Many artists also use improvisational techniques to help their creative flow.\n\nThe following are two significant domains that use improvisation:\n\n\nIn problem-solving contexts, the random-word creativity technique is perhaps the simplest method. A person confronted with a problem is presented with a randomly generated word, in the hopes of a solution arising from any associations between the word and the problem. This technique is based on associative thinking, the process of retrieving information from our knowledge and automatically find patterns across elements. While standard associative thinking generates associations between concepts that are strongly related and not very original, the unpredictability of a random word will lead to explore new associations that would not emerge automatically, and hopefully trigger novel solutions. A random image, sound, or article can be used instead of a random word as a kind of creativity goad or provocation.\n\nThere are many problem-solving tools and methodologies to support creativity:\n\n\nFor project management purposes, group creativity techniques are creativity techniques used by a team in the course of executing a project. Some relevant techniques are brainstorming, the nominal group technique, the Delphi technique, idea/mind mapping, the affinity diagram, and multicriteria decision analysis. These techniques are referenced in the \"Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge\".\n\nGroup creativity techniques can be used in a sequence; for example:\n\nMultiple studies have confirmed that distraction actually increases creative cognition. One such study done by Jonathan Schooler found that non-demanding distractions improve performance on a classic creativity task called the UUT (Unusual Uses Task) in which the subject must come up with as many possible uses for a common object. The results confirmed that decision-related neural processes occur during moments of unconscious thought while a person engages in a non-demanding task. The research showed that while distracted a subject isn’t maintaining one thought for a particularly long time, which in turn allows different ideas to float in and out of one’s consciousness—this sort of associative process leads to creative incubation.\n\nAmbient noise is another variable that is conducive to distraction, yet it has been proven that a moderate level of noise actually heighten creativity. Professor Ravi Mehta conducted a study to research the degree of distraction induced by various noise levels and their effect on creativity. The series of experiments show that a moderate level of ambient noise (70 dB) produces just enough distraction to induce processing disfluency, which leads to abstract cognition. These higher construal levels caused by moderate levels of noise consequently enhance creativity.\n\nIn 2014, a study found that walking increased creativity, an activity favored by Albert Einstein.\n\nSome advocate enhancing creativity by taking advantage of hypnagogia, the transition from wakefulness to sleep, using techniques such as lucid dreaming. One technique used by Salvador Dalí was to drift off to sleep in an armchair with a set of keys in his hand; when he fell completely asleep, the keys would fall and wake him up, allowing him to recall his mind's subconscious imaginings. Thomas Edison used the same technique, with ball bearings.\n\nA study from 2014 conducted by researchers in China and the US, including the psychologist Michael Posner found that performing a short 30 minute meditation session each day, for seven days, was sufficient to improve verbal and visual creativity, as measured by the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, due to the positive effects of meditation on emotional regulation. The same researchers also showed in 2015 that short term meditation training could also improve insight-based problem solving (the type commonly associated with an \"Ah-ha\", or \"eureka\" type moment of realization) as measured by the Remote Associates Test.\n"}

Typically, a datasheet is created by the manufacturer and begins with an introductory page describing the rest of the document, followed by listings of specific characteristics, with further information on the connectivity of the devices. In cases where there is relevant source code to include, it is usually attached near the end of the document or separated into another file.\n\nDepending on the specific purpose, a datasheet may offer an average value, a typical value, a typical range, engineering tolerances, or a nominal value. The type and source of data are usually stated on the datasheet.\n\nA datasheet is usually used for technical communication to describe technical characteristics of an item or product. It can be published by the manufacturer to help people choose products or to help use the products. By contrast, a technical specification is an explicit set of requirements to be satisfied by a material, product, or service.\n\nAn electronic datasheet specifies characteristics in a formal structure that allows the information to be processed by a machine. Such machine readable descriptions can facilitate information retrieval, display, design, testing, interfacing, verification, and system discovery. Examples include transducer electronic data sheets for describing sensor characteristics, and Electronic device descriptions in CANopen or descriptions in markup languages, such as SensorML.\n\nExamples include:\n\nA typical datasheet for an electronic component contains most of the following information: \n\n\nAlthough a datasheet may include a \"typical use\" circuit diagram, as well as programming examples in the case of programmable devices, this sort of information is often published in a separate application note, with a high level of detail.\n\nHistorically, datasheets were typically available in a databook that contained many datasheets, usually grouped by manufacturer or general type. Today, they are also available through the Internet in table form or via downloadable (usually PDF) documents.\n\nA Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), Safety Data Sheet (SDS), or Product Safety Data Sheet (PSDS) is an important component of product stewardship and occupational safety and health. These are required by agencies such as OSHA in its Hazard Communication Standard, 29 C.F.R. 1910.1200. It provides workers with ways to allow them to work in a safe manner and gives them physical data (melting point, boiling point, flash point, etc.), toxicity, health effects, first aid, reactivity, storage, disposal, protective equipment, and spill-handling procedures. The MSDSs differ from country to country, as different countries have different regulations. In some jurisdictions, it is compulsory for the SDS to state the chemical's risks, safety, and effect on the environment.\n\nThe SDSs are a commonly used classification for logging information on chemicals, chemical compounds, and chemical mixtures. The SDSs often include the safe use of the chemical and the hazardous nature of the chemical. Anytime chemicals are used these data sheets will be found.\n\nThere is a need to have an internationally recognized symbol when describing hazardous substances. Labels can include hazard symbols such as the European Union standard black diagonal cross on an orange background, used to denote a harmful substance.\n\nThe purpose of an SDS is not so that the general public will have a knowledge of how to read and understand it, but more so that it can be used in an occupational setting to allow workers to be able to work with it.\n\nData sheets and pages are available for specific properties of chemicals in Chemical elements data references: example, Melting points of the elements (data page). Specific materials have technical data in individual sheets such as Ethanol (data page): this includes subjects such as structure and properties, thermodynamic properties, spectral data, vapor pressure, etc. Other chemical data sheets are available from individual producers of chemicals, often on their web pages.\n\nData sheets for automobiles may be described under several names such as features, specs, engineering data, technical summary, etc. They help communicate the technical information about a car to potential buyers and are useful for comparisons with similar cars. They might include: critical inside and outside dimensions, weight, fuel efficiency, engine and drive train, towing capability, safety features and options, warranty, etc.\n\n\n"}

The primary purpose of the DRS, as embodied in its first statement of rules, is to promote ‘the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields'. This established the intention of being an interdisciplinary learned society, taking a scholarly and domain independent view of the process of designing. Membership is open to anyone interested in design research, and members with established experience and a strong background in design research may apply to be elected as a DRS Fellow.\n\nThe origins of the Society lay in the first conference on design methods, (full title \"The Conference on Systematic and Intuitive Methods in Engineering, Industrial Design, Architecture and Communications\") held in London in 1962, which enabled a core of people to be identified who shared interests in new approaches to the process of designing.\n\nInitially, the DRS promoted its aims through a series of one-day conferences and the publication of a quarterly newsletter to members. However, within a few years, unsuccessful attempts to establish a published journal and fruitless internal debate about the Society's goals led to inactivity. The Society was revived by its first major international conference, on design participation, held in Manchester in 1971. At that conference a meeting of DRS members led to a call for a special general meeting of the Society, and to changes of officers and council members. Subsequently, a series of conferences was held through the 1970s and 80s: in London (1973), Portsmouth (1976, 1980), Istanbul (1978), and Bath (1984).\n\nIn the mid-1970s DRS also collaborated with the Design Methods Group, based in the USA, including publishing a joint journal, Design Research and Methods.\n\nBy the late 1970s there was enough enthusiasm, and evidence of design research activity around the world, for the DRS to approach IPC Press (now Elsevier Science) with a successful proposal for its own journal. Design Studies, the international journal for design research, was launched in 1979. A monthly internet news bulletin DesignResearchNews was started in 1998 and has over 9000 subscribers. Between 2006 and 2009 the Society also published a quarterly newsletter, Design Research Quarterly.\n\nA new biennial series of DRS conferences began in 2002 with the 'Common Ground' conference in London. Subsequent ones have been held at venues around the world, with a variety of themes. See the Table below. In 2005 DRS was one of the founding members of the International Association of Societies of Design Research (IASDR), which also holds biennial, international conferences.\n\nSpecial Interest Groups provide a forum for specific areas of research which are of interest to the Design Research Community and its members. SIGs organise events and discussion in a number of ways to facilitate the exchange and development of best practice in the field. Each SIG is organised by a convenor who is supported by an organising group and the SIG members. DRS members are invited to join any Special Interest Group to contribute actively to research in the subject area of their chosen group.\n\nEKSIG is concerned with the understanding and role of knowledge in research and professional practice in design in order to clarify fundamental principles and practices of using design practice within research both with regard to research regulations and requirements, and research methodology.\n\nThe main aims of EKSIG are:\n\nEKSIG runs a biennial conference series, special strands at the DRS and IASDR conferences. It also runs a discussion list, which is used for announcements and debate about the core issues of knowledge and methodology in research and practice in the creative disciplines.\nAll papers selected for presentation at the conference are published in the conference proceedings: an abstract booklet with a CD or USB of the full papers and post-conference online publication, the preferred format of the DRS. Selected papers from each conference have been published in an appropriate journal as a special issue: \"Journal of Visual Arts Practice\" in 2007, \"Journal of Research Practice \"in 2010, \"Journal of Art and Design Education in Higher Education \"in 2012, \"Journal of Art and Design Education in Higher Education \"and in 2015, \"Journal of Research Practice \".\n\nThe SIG focuses on bringing together designers, design researchers, landscape architects and others who aim to improve personal and societal wellbeing through design.\n\nThis SIG on design pedagogy aims to bring together design researchers, teachers and practitioners, and others responsible for the delivery of design education, to clarify and develop the role of design research in providing the theoretical underpinning for design education. \nThe DRS Design Pedagogy Special Interest Group is bringing together other research which is directed to similar ends. Design research is not an irrelevant activity living in its own little ghetto, but rather it provides the basis for the academic core of design teaching and pedagogic innovation. By that means through the provision of the next generation of designers it links into design practice.\nThe DRS PedSIG runs special streams at DRS biannual conferences. It also organised symposia which were hosted by the Coventry University on 27 March 2009 and 28 January 2011.\n\nIn 2010, the DRS PedSIG and CUMULUS Association have join forces to develop a bi-annual international research events. The 1st International Symposium for Design Education Researchers in collaboration with: CUMULUS Association; Design Research Society (DRS); five other international universities (which included: Aalto University, L'École de Design Nantes Atlantique, Coventry University, L'École Parsons à Paris, and Politecnico di Milano); the Lieu de Design, Chambre de commerce et d’industrie de Paris and AVA Publishing. The symposium was held in a prestigious location of in May 2011. A special issue of Collection, a research journal, has been produced featuring a selection of contributions. The 2nd International Conference for Design Research Educators, DRS//CUMULUS 2013, was hosted by the Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences.\n\nThe OPENSiG was originally launched in 2007 under the name ‘Emotion, Experience and Interaction’. A special strand at the DRS conference 2008 and two successful workshops at Sheffield Hallam University (2007) and Nottingham Trent University (2010) served to define the group’s interest in broad questions about human-object interactions – focusing on Objects and engaging with social Practices, which involve Experiences with/ of objects in Networks of relationship.\n\nThe Inclusive Design Research Special Interest Group (InclusiveSIG) aims to provide an international platform for researchers, design practitioners, design educators and students, and the general public to exchange knowledge about inclusive design and to empower wider participation in design.\n\nDesign Research Society’s Design Innovation Management Special Interest Group (DIMSIG) in collaboration with the Design Society’s Design Management Special Interest Group (DeMSIG) formed a cross-societal working party named the Design Management Academy (DMA). The Design School at Hong Kong Polytechnic hosted the first Design Management Academy international conference in June 2017.\n\n"}

Her mother, Dorothy Deanne (\"née\" Keaton; 1921–2008), was a homemaker and amateur photographer; her father, John Newton Ignatius \"Jack\" Hall (1922–1990), was a real estate broker and civil engineer. Keaton was raised a Free Methodist by her mother. Her mother won the \"Mrs. Los Angeles\" pageant for homemakers; Keaton has said that the theatricality of the event inspired her first impulse to be an actress, and led to her wanting to work on stage. She has also credited Katharine Hepburn, whom she admires for playing strong and independent women, as one of her inspirations.\n\nKeaton is a 1964 graduate of Santa Ana High School in Santa Ana, California. During her time there, she participated in singing and acting clubs at school, and starred as Blanche DuBois in a school production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". After graduation, she attended Santa Ana College, and later Orange Coast College as an acting student, but dropped out after a year to pursue an entertainment career in Manhattan. Upon joining the Actors' Equity Association, she changed her surname to Keaton, her mother's maiden name, as there was already an actress registered under the name of Diane Hall. For a brief time, she also moonlighted at nightclubs with a singing act. She would later revisit her nightclub act in \"Annie Hall\" (1977) and \"And So It Goes\" (2014), and a cameo in \"Radio Days\" (1987).\n\nKeaton began studying acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. She initially studied acting under the Meisner technique, an ensemble acting technique first evolved in the 1930s by Sanford Meisner, a New York stage actor/acting coach/director who had been a member of The Group Theater (1931–1940). She has described her acting technique as, \"<nowiki>[</nowiki>being<nowiki>]</nowiki> only as good as the person you're acting with ... As opposed to going it on my own and forging my path to create a wonderful performance without the help of anyone. I always need the help of everyone!\" According to Jack Nicholson, \"She approaches a script sort of like a play in that she has the entire script memorized before you start doing the movie, which I don't know any other actors doing that.\"\n\nIn 1968, Keaton became a member of the \"Tribe\" and understudy to Sheila in the original Broadway production of \"Hair\". She gained some notoriety for her refusal to disrobe at the end of Act I when the cast performs nude, even though nudity in the production was optional for actors (Those who performed nude received a $50 bonus). After acting in \"Hair\" for nine months, she auditioned for a part in Woody Allen's production of \"Play It Again, Sam\". After nearly being passed over for being too tall (at 5ft 8 in./1.73m she is twoinches/fivecm taller than Allen), she won the part.\n\nAfter being nominated for a Tony Award for \"Play It Again, Sam\", Keaton made her film debut in \"Lovers and Other Strangers\" (1970). She followed with guest roles on the television series \"Love, American Style\" and \"Night Gallery\", and \"Mannix\". Between films, Keaton appeared in a series of deodorant commercials.\n\nKeaton's breakthrough role came two years later when she was cast as Kay Adams, the girlfriend and eventual wife of Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 film \"The Godfather\". Coppola noted that he first noticed Keaton in \"Lovers and Other Strangers\", and cast her because of her reputation for eccentricity that he wanted her to bring to the role (Keaton claims that at the time she was commonly referred to as \"the kooky actress\" of the film industry). Her performance in the film was loosely based on her real life experience of making the film, both of which she has described as being \"the woman in a world of men.\" \"The Godfather\" was an unparalleled critical and financial success, becoming the highest-grossing film of the year and winning the Best Picture Oscar of 1972.\n\nTwo years later, she reprised her role as Kay Adams in \"The Godfather Part II\". She was initially reluctant, stating that, \"At first, I was skeptical about playing Kay again in the \"Godfather\" sequel. But when I read the script, the character seemed much more substantial than in the first movie.\" In \"Part II\", her character changed dramatically, becoming more embittered about her husband's activities. Even though Keaton received widespread exposure from the films, her character's importance was minimal. \"Time\" wrote that she was \"invisible in \"The Godfather\" and pallid in \"The Godfather, Part II\".\"\n\nKeaton's other notable films of the 1970s included many collaborations with Woody Allen; although by the time they made films together, their romantic involvement had ended. She played many eccentric characters in several of his comic and dramatic films, including \"Sleeper\", \"Love and Death\", \"Interiors\", \"Manhattan\", \"Manhattan Murder Mystery\" and the film version of \"Play It Again, Sam\", directed by Herbert Ross. Allen has credited Keaton as his muse during his early film career.\n\nIn 1977, Keaton starred with Allen in the romantic comedy \"Annie Hall\", one of her most famous roles. \"Annie Hall\", written by Allen and Marshall Brickman and directed by Allen, was believed to be autobiographical of his relationship with Keaton. Allen based the character of Annie Hall loosely on Keaton (\"Annie\" is a nickname of hers, and \"Hall\" is her original surname). Many of Keaton's mannerisms and her self-deprecating sense of humor were added into the role by Allen. (Director Nancy Meyers has claimed \"Diane's the most self-deprecating person alive.\") Keaton has also said that Allen wrote the character as an \"idealized version\" of herself. The two starred as a frequently on-again, off-again couple living in New York City. Her acting was later summed up by CNN as \"awkward, self-deprecating, speaking in endearing little whirlwinds of semi-logic\", and by Allen as a \"nervous breakdown in slow motion.\" The film was both a major financial and critical success, and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Keaton's performance also won the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 2006, \"Premiere\" magazine ranked Keaton in \"Annie Hall\" as 60th on its list of the \"100 Greatest Performances of All Time\", and noted:\nIt's hard to play ditzy. ... The genius of Annie is that despite her loopy backhand, awful driving, and nervous tics, she's also a complicated, intelligent woman. Keaton brilliantly displays this dichotomy of her character, especially when she yammers away on a first date with Alvy (Woody Allen), while the subtitle reads, 'He probably thinks I'm a yoyo.' Yo-yo? Hardly.\nKeaton's eccentric wardrobe in \"Annie Hall\", which consisted mainly of vintage men's clothing, including neckties, vests, baggy pants, and fedora hats, made her an unlikely fashion icon of the late 1970s. A small amount of the clothing seen in the film came from Keaton herself, who was already known for her tomboyish clothing style years before \"Annie Hall\", and Ruth Morley designed the movie's costumes. Soon after the film's release, men's clothing and pantsuits became popular attire for women. She is known to favor men's vintage clothing, and usually appears in public wearing gloves and conservative attire. (A 2005 profile in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" described her as \"easy to find. Look for the only woman in sight dressed in a turtleneck on a 90-degree afternoon in Pasadena.\")\n\nHer photo by Douglas Kirkland appeared on the cover of the September 26, 1977, issue of \"Time\" magazine, with the story dubbing her \"the funniest woman now working in films.\" Later that year, she departed from her usual lighthearted comic roles when she won the highly coveted lead role in the drama \"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\", based on the novel by Judith Rossner. In the film, she played a Catholic schoolteacher for deaf children, who lives a double life, spending nights frequenting singles bars and engaging in promiscuous sex. Keaton became interested in the role after seeing it as a \"psychological case history.\" The same issue of \"Time\" commended her role choice and criticized the restricted roles available for female actors in American films: A male actor can fly a plane, fight a war, shoot a badman, pull off a sting, impersonate a big cheese in business or politics. Men are presumed to be interesting. A female can play a wife, play a whore, get pregnant, lose her baby, and, um, let's see ... Women are presumed to be dull. ... Now a determined trend spotter can point to a handful of new films whose makers think that women can bear the dramatic weight of a production alone, or virtually so. Then there is Diane Keaton in \"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\". As Theresa Dunn, Keaton dominates this raunchy, risky, violent dramatization of Judith Rossner's 1975 novel about a schoolteacher who cruises singles bars.\n\nIn addition to acting, Keaton has stated that \"<nowiki>[I]</nowiki> had a lifelong ambition to be a singer.\" She had a brief, unrealized career as a recording artist in the 1970s. Her first record was an original cast recording of \"Hair\", in 1971. In 1977, she began recording tracks for a solo album, but the finished record never materialized.\n\nKeaton met with more success in the medium of still photography. Like her character in \"Annie Hall\", Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s, she began exploring her avocation more seriously. \"Rolling Stone had asked me to take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.' So I began shooting them\", she recalled in 2003. \"These places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared. It was so easy and I could do it myself. It was an adventure for me.\" \"Reservations\", her collection of photos of hotel interiors, was published in book form in 1980.\n\nIn \"Manhattan\" in 1979, Keaton and Woody Allen ended their long working relationship; the film would be their last major collaboration until 1993. In 1978, she became romantically involved with Warren Beatty, and two years later he cast her to play opposite him in \"Reds\". In the film, she played Louise Bryant, a journalist and feminist, who flees from her husband to work with radical journalist John Reed (Beatty), and later enters Russia to locate him as he chronicles the Russian Civil War. \"The New York Times\" wrote that Keaton was, \"nothing less than splendid as Louise Bryant– beautiful, selfish, funny and driven. It's the best work she has done to date.\" Keaton received her second Academy Award nomination for the film.\n\nBeatty cast Keaton after seeing her in \"Annie Hall\", as he wanted to bring her natural nervousness and insecure attitude to the role. The production of \"Reds\" was delayed several times following its conception in 1977, and Keaton almost left the project when she believed it would never be produced. Filming finally began two years later. In a 2006 \"Vanity Fair\" story, Keaton described her role as \"the everyman of that piece, as someone who wanted to be extraordinary but was probably more ordinary ... I knew what it felt like to be extremely insecure.\" Assistant director Simon Relph later stated that Louise Bryant was one of Keaton's most difficult roles, and that \"<nowiki>[she]</nowiki> almost got broken.\"\n\n1984 brought \"The Little Drummer Girl\", Keaton's first excursion into the thriller and action genre. \"The Little Drummer Girl\" was both a financial and critical failure, with critics claiming that Keaton was miscast for the genre, such as one review from \"The New Republic\" claiming that \"the title role, the pivotal role, is played by Diane Keaton, and around her the picture collapses in tatters. She is so feeble, so inappropriate.\" However, that same year she received positive reviews for her performance in \"Mrs. Soffel\", a film based on the true story of a repressed prison warden's wife who falls in love with a convicted murderer and arranges for his escape. Two years later she starred with Jessica Lange and Sissy Spacek in \"Crimes of the Heart\", adapted from Beth Henley's Pulitzer Prize-winning play into a moderately successful screen comedy. In 1987, she starred in \"Baby Boom\", her first of four collaborations with writer-producer Nancy Meyers. In \"Baby Boom\", Keaton starred as a Manhattan career woman who is suddenly forced to care for a toddler. That same year she made a cameo in Allen's film \"Radio Days\" as a nightclub singer. 1988's \"The Good Mother\" was a misstep for Keaton. The film was a financial disappointment (according to Keaton, the film was \"a Big Failure. Like, BIG failure\"), and some critics panned her performance, such as one review from \"The Washington Post\": \"her acting degenerates into hype– as if she's trying to sell an idea she can't fully believe in.\"\n\nIn 1987, Keaton directed and edited her first feature film, a documentary named \"Heaven\" about the possibility of an afterlife. \"Heaven\" met with mixed critical reaction, with \"The New York Times\" likening it to \"a conceit imposed on its subjects.\" Over the next four years, Keaton went on to direct music videos for artists such as Belinda Carlisle, including the video for Carlisle's chart-topping hit \"Heaven Is a Place on Earth,\" two television films starring Patricia Arquette, and episodes of the series \"China Beach\" and \"Twin Peaks\".\n\nBy the 1990s, Keaton had established herself as one of the most popular and versatile actors in Hollywood. She shifted to more mature roles, frequently playing matriarchs of middle-class families. Of her role choices and avoidance of becoming typecast, she said: \"Most often a particular role does you some good and Bang! You have loads of offers, all of them for similar roles ... I have tried to break away from the usual roles and have tried my hand at several things.\"\n\nShe began the decade with \"The Lemon Sisters\", a poorly received comedy/drama that she starred in and produced, which was shelved for a year after its completion. In 1991, Keaton starred with Steve Martin in the family comedy \"Father of the Bride\". She was almost not cast in the film, as the commercial failure of \"The Good Mother\" had strained her relationship with Walt Disney Pictures, the studio of both films. \"Father of the Bride\" was Keaton's first major hit after four years of commercial disappointments.\n\nKeaton reprised her role four years later in the sequel, as a woman who becomes pregnant in middle age at the same time as her daughter. A review of the film for \"The San Francisco Examiner\" was one of many in which Keaton once again received comparison to Katharine Hepburn: \"No longer relying on that stuttering uncertainty that seeped into all her characterizations of the 1970s, she has somehow become Katharine Hepburn with a deep maternal instinct, that is, she is a fine and intelligent actress who doesn't need to be tough and edgy in order to prove her feminism.\"\n\nKeaton reprised her role of Kay Adams in 1990's \"The Godfather Part III\". Set 20 years after the end of \"The Godfather, Part II\", Keaton's part had evolved into the estranged ex-wife of Michael Corleone. Criticism of the film and Keaton again centered on her character's unimportance in the film. \"The Washington Post\" wrote: \"Even though she is authoritative in the role, Keaton suffers tremendously from having no real function except to nag Michael for his past sins.\" In 1993, Keaton starred in \"Manhattan Murder Mystery\", her first major film role in a Woody Allen film since 1979, having made a cameo in 1987's \"Radio Days\". Her part was originally intended for Mia Farrow, but Farrow dropped out of the project after her split with Allen.\n\nIn 1995, Keaton directed \"Unstrung Heroes\", her first theatrically released narrative film. The movie, adapted from Franz Lidz's memoir, starred Nathan Watt as a boy in 1960s whose mother (Andie MacDowell) becomes ill with cancer. As her sickness advances and his inventor father (John Turturro) grows increasingly distant, the boy is sent to live with his two eccentric uncles (Maury Chaykin and Michael Richards). In a geographic switch, Keaton shifted the story's setting from the New York of Lidz's book to the Southern California of her own childhood. And the four mad uncles were reduced to a whimsical odd couple. In an essay for \"The New York Times\", Lidz said that the cinematic Selma had died not of cancer, but of 'Old Movie Disease'. \"Someday somebody may find a cure for cancer, but the terminal sappiness of cancer movies is probably beyond remedy.\"\nThough it played in a relatively limited release and made little impression at the box office, the film and its direction were generally well-received critically.\n\nKeaton's most successful film of the decade was the 1996 comedy \"The First Wives Club\". She starred with Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler as a trio of \"first wives\": middle-aged women who had been divorced by their husbands in favor of younger women. Keaton claimed that making the film \"saved <nowiki>[her]</nowiki> life.\" The film was a major success, grossing US$105million at the North American box office, and it developed a cult following among middle-aged women. Reviews of the film were generally positive for Keaton and her co-stars, and she was even referred to by \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" as \"probably <nowiki>[one of]</nowiki> the best comic film actresses alive.\" In 1997, Keaton, along Hawn and Midler, was a recipient of the Women in Film Crystal Award, which honors \"outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.\"\n\nAlso in 1996, Keaton starred as Bessie, a woman with leukemia, in \"Marvin's Room\", an adaptation of the play by Scott McPherson. Meryl Streep played her estranged sister Lee, and had also initially been considered for the role of Bessie. The film also starred a young Leonardo DiCaprio as Lee's rebellious son. Roger Ebert stated that \"Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems.\" Keaton earned a third Academy Award nomination for the film, which was critically acclaimed. Keaton said that the biggest challenge of the role was understanding the mentality of a person with a terminal illness.\n\nIn 1999, Keaton narrated the one-hour public-radio documentary \"If I Get Out Alive\", the first to focus on the conditions and brutality faced by young people in the adult correctional system. The program, produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media, aired on public radio stations across the country, and was honored with a First Place National Headliner Award and a Casey Medal for Meritorious Journalism.\n\nKeaton's first film of 2000 was \"Hanging Up\" with Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow. Keaton also directed the film, despite claiming in a 1996 interview that she would never direct herself in a film, saying \"as a director, you automatically have different goals. I can't think about directing when I'm acting.\" The film was a drama about three sisters coping with the senility and eventual death of their elderly father, played by Walter Matthau. \"Hanging Up\" rated poorly with critics and grossed a modest US$36million at the North American box office.\n\nIn 2001, Keaton co-starred with Warren Beatty in \"Town & Country\", a critical and financial fiasco. Budgeted at an estimated US$90million, the film opened to little notice and grossed only US$7million in its North American theatrical run. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that \"Town & Country\" was \"less deserving of a review than it is an obituary...The corpse took with it the reputations of its starry cast, including Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton.\" Also in 2001, and 2002, Keaton starred in four low-budget television films. She played a fanatical nun in the religious drama \"Sister Mary Explains It All\", an impoverished mother in the drama \"On Thin Ice\", and a bookkeeper in the mob comedy \"Plan B\". In \"Crossed Over\", she played Beverly Lowry, a woman who forms an unusual friendship with the only woman executed while on death row in Texas, Karla Faye Tucker.\n\nKeaton's first major hit since 1996 came in 2003's \"Something's Gotta Give\", directed by Nancy Meyers and co-starring Jack Nicholson. Nicholson and Keaton, aged 63 and 56 respectively, were seen as bold casting choices for leads in a romantic comedy. Twentieth Century Fox, the film's original studio, reportedly declined to produce the film, fearing that the lead characters were too old to be bankable. Keaton commented about the situation in \"Ladies' Home Journal\": \"Let's face it, people my age and Jack's age are much deeper, much more soulful, because they've seen a lot of life. They have a great deal of passion and hope—why shouldn't they fall in love? Why shouldn't movies show that?\" Keaton played a middle-aged playwright who falls in love with her daughter's much older boyfriend. The film was a major success at the box office, grossing US$125million in North America. Roger Ebert wrote that \"Nicholson and Keaton bring so much experience, knowledge and humor to their characters that the film works in ways the screenplay might not have even hoped for.\" The following year, Keaton received her fourth Academy Award nomination for her role in the film.\n\nKeaton's only film between the years of 2004 and 2006 was the comedy \"The Family Stone\" (2005), starring an ensemble cast that also included Sarah Jessica Parker, Claire Danes, Rachel McAdams, and Craig T. Nelson. In the film, scripted and directed by Thomas Bezucha, Keaton played a breast cancer survivor and matriarch of a big New England family, who reunite at the parents' home for their annual Christmas holidays. The film was released to moderate critical and commercial success, and earned US$92.2million worldwide. Keaton received her second Satellite Award nomination for her portrayal, on which Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" commented, \"Keaton, a sorceress at blending humor and heartbreak, honors the film with a grace that makes it stick in the memory.\"\n\nIn 2007, Keaton starred in both \"Because I Said So\" and \"Mama's Boy\". In the romantic comedy \"Because I Said So\", directed by Michael Lehmann, Keaton played a long-divorced mother of three daughters, determined to pair off her only single daughter, Milly, played by Mandy Moore. Also starring Stephen Collins and Gabriel Macht, the project opened to overwhelmingly negative reviews by critics, with Wesley Morris of \"The Boston Globe\" calling it \"a sloppily made bowl of reheated chick-flick cliches\", and was ranked among the worst-reviewed films of the year. The following year, Keaton received her first and only Golden Raspberry Award nomination to date, for the film. In \"Mama's Boy\", director Tim Hamilton's feature film debut, Keaton starred as the mother of a self-absorbed 29-year-old (played by Jon Heder) whose world turns upside down when his widowed mother starts dating and considers booting him out of the house. Distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States only, the independent comedy garnered largely negative reviews.\n\nIn 2008, Keaton starred alongside Dax Shepard and Liv Tyler in Vince Di Meglio's dramedy \"Smother\", playing the overbearing mother of an unemployed therapist, who decides to move in with him and his girlfriend following the split from her husband, played by Ken Howard. As with \"Mama's Boy\", the film received a limited release only, resulting in a gross of US$1.8million worldwide. Critical reaction to the film was generally unfavorable, and once again Keaton was dismissed for her role choices, with Sandra Hall of the \"New York Post\" writing, \"Diane's career is dyin' [...] this time, sadly, she's gone too far. She's turned herself into a mother-in-law joke.\" Also in 2008, Keaton appeared alongside Katie Holmes and Queen Latifah in the crime-comedy film \"Mad Money\", directed by Callie Khouri. Based on the British television drama \"Hot Money\" (2001), the film revolves around three female employees of the Federal Reserve who scheme to steal money that is about to be destroyed. As with Keaton's previous projects, the film bombed at the box offices with a gross total of US$26.4million, and was universally panned by critics, ranking third in the \"New York Post\" Top 10 Worst Movies of 2008 overview.\n\nIn 2010, Keaton starred alongside Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford in Roger Michell's comedy \"Morning Glory\", playing the veteran TV host of a fictional morning talk show that desperately needs to boost its lagging ratings. Portraying a narcissistic character who would do anything to please the audience, Keaton described her role as \"the kind of woman you love to hate.\" Inspired by Neil Simon's 1972 Broadway play \"The Sunshine Boys\", the film became a moderate success at the box office for a worldwide total of almost US$59million. Though some critics found that Keaton was underused in the film, the actress was generally praised for her performance, with James Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" noting that \"Diane Keaton is so good at her part that one can see her sliding effortlessly into an anchor's chair on a real morning show.\"\nIn fall 2010, Keaton joined the production of the comedy drama \"Darling Companion\" by Lawrence Kasdan, which was released in 2012. Co-starring Kevin Kline and Dianne Wiest and set in Telluride, Colorado, the film follows a woman, played by Keaton, whose husband loses her much-beloved dog at a wedding held at their vacation home in the Rocky Mountains, resulting in a search party to find the pet. Kasdan's first film in nine years, the film bombed at the US box office, where it scored about US$790,000 throughout its entire theatrical run. Generally negative with the film, critics dismissed the film as \"an overwritten, underplotted vanity project\", but applauded Keaton's performance. Ty Burr from \"The Boston Globe\" felt that the film \"would be instantly forgettable if not for Keaton, who imbues [her role] with a sorrow, warmth, wisdom, and rage that feel earned [...] Her performance here is an extension of worn, resilient grace.\"\n\nAlso in 2011, Keaton began production on Justin Zackham's 2013 ensemble comedy \"The Big Wedding\", in which she, along with Robert De Niro, played a long-divorced couple who, for the sake of their adopted son's wedding and his very religious biological mother, pretend they are still married. Upon release, the remake of the original 2006 French film \"Mon frère se marie\" received largely negative reviews. In his review for \"The New York Post\", Lou Lumenick stated that \"the brutally unfunny, cringe-worthy \"The Big Wedding\" provides ample opportunities for Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon, and Robin Williams to embarrass themselves\".\n\nIn 2014, Keaton starred in \"And So It Goes\" and \"5 Flights Up\". In Rob Reiner's romantic dramedy \"And So It Goes\", Keaton portrayed a widowed lounge singer, who finds autumnal love with a bad boy, played by Michael Douglas. The film received largely negative reviews from critics, who felt that \"\"And So It Goes\" aims for comedy, but with two talented actors stuck in a half-hearted effort from a once-mighty filmmaker, it ends in unintentional tragedy.\" Keaton co-starred with Morgan Freeman in Richard Loncraine's comedy film \"5 Flights Up\". Based on the novel \"Heroic Measures\" by Jill Ciment, they play a long-married couple who have an eventful weekend after they are forced to contemplate selling their beloved Brooklyn apartment. Shot in New York, the film premiered, under its former name \"Ruth & Alex\", at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The same year, Keaton became the first woman to receive the Golden Lion Award from the Zurich Film Festival.\n\nKeaton's only film of 2015 was \"Love the Coopers\", an ensemble comedy about a troubled family getting together for Christmas, for which she reunited with \"Because I Said So\" writer Jessie Nelson. Also starring John Goodman, Ed Helms, and Marisa Tomei, Keaton was attached for several years before the film went into production. Her cast was instrumental in financing and recruiting most other actors, which led her to an executive producer credit in the film. Upon its release, \"Love the Coopers\" received largely negative reviews from critics, who called it a \"bittersweet blend of holiday cheer\", and became a moderate commercial success at a worldwide total of US$41.1million against a budget of US$17million. Also in 2015, Netflix announced the comedy \"Divanation\", for which Keaton was expected to reunite with her \"First Wives Club\" co-stars Midler and Hawn to portray a former singing group, but the project failed to materialize.\n\nKeaton voiced amnesiac fish Dory's mother in Disney and Pixar's \"Finding Dory\" (2016), the sequel to the 2003 Pixar computer-animated film \"Finding Nemo\". Upon release, the film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over US$1billion worldwide, becoming the second Pixar film to cross this mark following \"Toy Story 3\" (2010). It also set numerous records, including the biggest animated opening of all time in North America, emerging as the biggest animated film of all time in the US. Keaton's other project of 2016 was the HBO eight-part series \"The Young Pope\" opposite Jude Law, in which she plays a nun who raised the newly elected Pope and helped him reach the papacy. The mini series received two nominations for the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, becoming the first Italian TV series to be nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nIn 2017, Keaton appeared opposite Brendan Gleeson in the British dramedy film \"Hampstead\". Based on the life of Harry Hallowes, it depicts Keaton as an American widow who helps a local man defending his ramshackle hut, and the life he has been leading on Hampstead Heath for 17 years. The specialty release earned a mixed reception from critics, who were less impressed with the film's \"deeply mediocre story,\" and became a minor commercial success. Keaton's only project of 2018 was \"Book Club\" in which she starred alongside Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen as four friends who read \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" as part of their monthly book club, and subsequently begin to change how they view their personal relationships. The romantic comedy film received mixed reviews from critics who felt that \"Book Club\" only \"intermittently rises to the level of its impressive veteran cast,\" but at a worldwide gross of over $78 million, became Keaton's biggest commercial success in a non-voice role since 2003's \"Something's Gotta Give\".\n\nKeaton has had several romantic associations with noted entertainment industry personalities, starting with her time with the Broadway production of \"Play It Again, Sam\" when she auditioned for director Woody Allen. Their association became personal following a dinner after a late-night rehearsal. It was her sense of humor that attracted Allen. They briefly lived together during the Broadway production, but by the time of the film release of the same name in 1972, their living arrangements became informal. They worked together on eight films between 1971 and 1993, and Keaton has said that Allen remains one of her closest friends.\n\nShe was already dating Warren Beatty from 1979 when they had co-lead roles in the film \"Reds\". Beatty was a regular subject in tabloid magazines and media coverage in which she was included much to her bewilderment. Her avoidance of the spotlight earned her in 1985 from \"Vanity Fair\" the attribution as \"the most reclusive star since Garbo.\" This relationship ended shortly after \"Reds\" wrapped. Troubles with the production are thought to have caused strain on the relationship, including numerous financial and scheduling problems. Keaton remains friends with Beatty.\n\nKeaton also had a relationship with her \"The Godfather Trilogy\" costar Al Pacino. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended following the filming of \"The Godfather Part III\". Keaton said of Pacino, \"Al was simply the most entertaining man... To me, that's, that is the most beautiful face. I think Warren was gorgeous, very pretty, but Al's face is like whoa. Killer, killer face.\"\n\nIn July 2001, Keaton revealed her thoughts on being older and unmarried: \"I don't think that because I'm not married it's made my life any less. That old maid myth is garbage.\" Keaton has two adopted children, daughter Dexter (adopted 1996) and son Duke (2001). Her father's death made mortality more apparent to her, and she decided to become a mother at age 50. She later said of having children, \"Motherhood has completely changed me. It's just about the most completely humbling experience that I've ever had.\"\n\nKeaton stated that she produced her 1987 documentary \"Heaven\" because, \"I was always pretty religious as a kid ... I was primarily interested in religion because I wanted to go to heaven.\" Nevertheless, she has also stated that she considered herself a Christian.\n\nKeaton is active in campaigns with the Los Angeles Conservancy to save and restore historic buildings, particularly in the Los Angeles area. Among the buildings she has been active in restoring is the Ennis House in the Hollywood Hills designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Keaton had also been active in the failed campaign to save the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles (a hotel featured in \"Reservations\"), the location of Robert Kennedy's assassination in 1968.

Originating in the high medieval period (late 11th to early 12th century), the type was frequently used throughout the 13th to 14th centuries. \nContinued use into the 15th and 16th centuries was mostly limited to high nobility, especially royalty, while lower nobility switched to the use of simple heraldic seals.\n\nEarly examples of equestrian seals are known from second half of the 11th century. \nThe oldest example that may be addressed as an \"equestrian seal\" is that of William I of England (c. 1067).\nAmong the oldest extant examples in Germany is the seal of Henry of Laach (c. 1090).\nThe horseman is characterized by the kite shield and a conical helmet, ofen bearing a banner.\nThis type is continued into the mid-12th century, and late examples of kite shields are found into the 1160s.\n\nThe peak of usage comes with the development of the tradition of chivalry in the high medieval period, during c. the last quarter of the 12th century and throughout the 13th century.\nSeals of the 1170s to 1190s show shield shapes transitional between the \"kite\" and the \"heater\" type. Helmet shapes become less conical and more rounded.\nThe horseman is now shown as the prototypical \"knight\" with a heraldic shield. From about the 1230s, the horse is increasingly shown as wearing a heraldic caparison, and the rider as wearing a great helm.\n\nAround the middle of the 13th century, there was a fashion to also represent ladies and ecclesiastics on horseback on their seal, not wearing armour, \nbut, as in the cases of Joan, Countess of Flanders (c. 1240), Maria of Brabant, Duchess of Bavaria (c. 1250) and Adelaide of Burgundy, Duchess of Brabant (c. 1260) practicing falconry.\n\nAfter 1300, equestrian seals were almost exclusively used by the high nobility, by bearers of the rank of duke or higher.\nRepresentations in seals of the 14th century show the nobleman with full heraldic achievements, often carrying a heraldic flag, or with a lance in full jousting armour.\n\nLate forms were used well into the early modern period in France and Germany.\nDepictions of monarchs in full armour, crested helmets, with lances or heraldic flags etc. fell out of use with the end of the joust in the early 17th century.\nFrederick the Great of Prussia used a \"Majestätssiegel\" which depicted him on horseback in 1772 (albeit no longer depicted as a fully armored knight but as a military commander).\n\nThe reverse of the Great Seal of Charles I of England (1627) shows the monarch in full gallop, wearing a fanciful classicist armour, accompanied by a hunting dog.\nThe British monarchs from 1707 onward continued the convention of depicting the seated and crowned monarch on the obverse, and the monarch on horseback on the reverse. This is the case also for the queen regnants (, Queen Victoria, ), who are depicted in sidesaddle.\n\n\n"}

Partially due to having been inspired by painter Adolphe Monticelli, Van Gogh sought the Provence region of France to further expand his painting skill and experience. Van Gogh used several pairs of complementary colors in the \"Farmhouse in Provence\", the color contrast bringing an intensity to his work. The painting is owned by the National Gallery of Art of Washington, D.C..\n\nAt the time that Van Gogh painted \"Farmhouse in Provence\" he was 35 years old. Living in Arles, in southern France, he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work, such as fields, farmhouses and people of the Arles, Nîmes and Avignon area.\n\nThe area was quite different than what he'd known in the Netherlands and Paris. The climate was hot and dry. People had dark hair and skin and spoke a different language than Parisian French. The colors were vivid. The terrain varied from plains to mountains. Here Van Gogh found a \"brilliance and light that would wash out details and simplify forms, reducing the world around him to the sort of pattern he admired in Japanese woodblocks\" and where the \"effect of the sun would strengthen the outlines of composition and reduce nuances of color to a few vivid contrasts.\"\n\nA prolific time, in less than 444 days Vincent made about 100 drawings and produced more than 200 paintings. Yet, he still wrote more than 200 letters. He described\na series of seven studies of wheat fields as, \"landscapes, yellow—old gold—done\nquickly, quickly, quickly, and in a hurry just like the harvester who is silent under the\nblazing sun, intent only on the reaping.\"\n\nIn a letter to his brother, Theo, he wrote, \"Painting as it is now, promises to become more subtle - more like music and less like sculpture - and above all, it promises color.\"\n\nVan Gogh used three pairs of complementary, or contrasting, colors which when sat together intensified the brilliance and intensity of one another's colors. One pair is orange and blue. There's the red and green of the plants. Last, pink clouds against the turquoise sky.\n\nVan Gogh used complementary, contrasting colors to bring an intensity to his work, which evolved over the periods of his work. Two complementary colors of the same degree of vividness and brightness placed next to one another produce an intense reaction, called the \"law of simultaneous contrast.\"\n\nVan Gogh mentioned the liveliness and interplay of \"a wedding of two complementary colors, their mingling and opposition, the mysterious vibrations of two kindred souls.\"\n\nWhile in Nuenen Van Gogh became familiar with Michel Eugène Chevreul's laws in weaving to maximize the intensity of colors through their contrast to adjacent colors.\n\nIn Paris he was exposed through his brother Theo to Adolphe Monticelli's still life work with flowers, which he admired. First, he saw Monticelli's use of color as an expansion of Delacroix's theories of color and contrast. Secondly he admired the effect Monticelli created by heavy application of paint. It was partially Monticelli, from Marseilles, who inspired Van Gogh's southerly move to Provence. He felt such kinship for the man, and desire to emulate his style, that he wrote in a letter to his sister Wil that he felt as if he were \"Monticelli's son or his brother.\"\n\nThe National Gallery of Art reports the correct sequence of ownership for the painting is: \n\nAnother sequence of ownership was given by J.-B. de la Faille in \"The Works of Vincent van Gogh, His Paintings and Drawings\" a portion of which was apparently in error (i.e., Bernheim-Jeune, Reid and Lefevre, Ackermann, Molyneux.)\n\n"}

The groups bordering one another are implied to share common olfactory characteristics. Fragrance wheels are frequently used as a classification tool in oenology and perfumery.\n\nThe first example of a fragrance wheel was conceived by Austrian perfumer Paul Jellinek and titled the \"Odor Effects Diagram\", published in the original German edition of his book \"The Practice of Modern Perfumery\" (1949). Other notable versions include the \"Fragrance Circle\", developed in 1979 by U. Harder at Haarman & Reimer, the \"Wine Aroma Wheel\", from 1984 by sensory chemist Ann C. Noble, and the \"Fragrance Wheel\", created in 1992 by perfumery taxonomist Michael Edwards.\n\nSince its creation, Michael Edwards' \"Fragrance Wheel\" and the developed fragrance classification scheme has been modified several times through the addition of different groups to encompass different fragrance types.\n\nThe four standard families are Floral, Oriental, Woody and Fresh. These are in turn divided into three sub-groups (e.g. in the Floral Family: Floral, Soft Floral, Floral Oriental) and arranged in a circle, each group being related to the next. Each of the subclasses were in turn divided into \"Fresh\", \"Crisp\", \"Classical\", and \"Rich\" compositions. Prior to 2010 \"Fougère\" family was placed at the center of this wheel since they are a large family of scents that usually contain fragrance elements from each of the other four families; citrus from the \"fresh\" family, oak moss and woods from the \"woody\" family, coumarin and incense from the \"Oriental\" family, and lavender from the \"floral\" family.\n\nIn this classification scheme, \"Chanel No.5\", which is traditionally classified as a \"Floral Aldehyde\" would be located under \"Soft Floral\" sub-group, and \"Amber\" scents would be placed within the \"Oriental\" group. As a class, Chypres are more difficult to place since they would be located under parts of the \"Oriental\" and \"Woody\" families. For instance, \"Guerlain Mitsouko\", which is classically identified as a chypre will be placed under \"Mossy Woods\", but \"Hermès Rouge\", a chypre with more floral character, would be placed under \"Floral Oriental\".\nOriginally they are:\nWith the publication of Fragrances of the World 2008, two new sub-groups: \"Fruity\" and \"Woods\", have been added to the wheel.\nThe chart was again modified in 2010, moving the Aromatics/Fougere group to between \"Citrus\" and \"Dry Woods\" to synchronize the chart with recent studies on smell perception.\nThe sub-groups of the fragrance wheel are:\n\n\n"}

The record was released as the group's second single in May 1980 on Optional Music with \"Police Truck\" as its B-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album, \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\" (1980); the original recording of the song, as well as the single's B-side, are available on the rarities album \"Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death\" (1987). The photograph in the front cover of the single was taken from the Thammasat University massacre in Thailand, and depicts a member of the right-wing crowd beating a hanged corpse of a student protester with a metal chair.\n\nThe song is an attack on a stereotypical, moralizing, privileged American college student. Its lyrics offer a satirical view of young, well-to-do and self-righteous Americans, contrasting such a lifestyle with the genocidal dictatorship of the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot (mentioned in the lyrics), which is estimated to have been responsible for the deaths of some two million people in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979.\n\nThe re-recording of this song that appears on \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\" is different from the single version, being fifty-five seconds longer, at a higher tempo and featuring an extended, surf-influenced intro, as well as an extended bridge and guitar solo. While the original lyrics include the satirically quoted word \"niggers\", subsequent performances by the reformed Dead Kennedys (post-2001, without vocalist Jello Biafra) and various other artists who have recorded the song over the years have omitted it substituting other words in its place. In performances over the years with other groups, Biafra has often used \"blacks\". The song also mentions the Dr. Seuss short story \"The Sneetches\".\n\nIn October 1998, Biafra was sued by former members of Dead Kennedys. According to Biafra, the suit was a result of his refusal to allow \"Holiday in Cambodia\" to be used in a commercial for Levi's Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi's due to what he believes are their unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. However, the other members claimed that their royalties had been defrauded. \"The record industry has been skimming royalties owed artists since the beginning,\" according to Dead Kennedys' guitarist East Bay Ray. \"This case is no different from blues musicians being taken advantage of in the twenties and thirties. Many people doubted the claims we made against our former record label back in 1998 but with this announcement there is no denying we were the victims here.\" Biafra lost the lawsuit and as the owner of Alternative Tentacles was ordered to pay $200,000 in damages to the other band members. \n\n\n\n"}

The company was located near Van Nuys, California and established in 1972 consequently reaching the public eye through studio musicians like Dann Huff, Michael Landau, and Neil Stubenhaus. The company is known for creating custom high end quality guitars, with an unusual headstock, and guitar body finishes with names like \"psychedelic vomit\", \"burning water\", and \"caramel cappuccino shmear\".\n\nDuring the 1980s the company did primarily repairs and modifications of guitars, but built some custom guitars based on parts from other manufacturers such as Kramer for the Los Angeles studio musicians Dean Parks, Michael Landau and Dann Huff. In 1987 the first production model was released called the Studio Elite, a hot-rodded Fender Stratocaster The woodwork was done by hand and it featured a \"hockey paddle\" headstock, which was used to ensure that the company does not infringe on Fender Musical Instruments Corporation's trademark headstock design. Additional standard features include a Demeter mid-boost circuit with a gain control and a preset switch and a neck finish designed to look like it has been worn-in through years of use even though it is brand new, similar to what Music Man did with their Eddie Van Halen signature model guitars. The Studio Elite model is featured on Guitarist magazine's list of \"50 guitars to play before you die\".\n\nTheir second model, the Ultimate Weapon (available with two or three humbuckers and a Floyd Rose locking tremolo), was introduced in 1993 and was also based on the Fender Stratocaster but with a redesigned appearance. The latest incarnation of the guitar, the Ultimate Weapon HD, introduced in 2007, came with a pickguard, an H/S/S pickup layout and a Wilkinson vibrato. Tyler describes this model as \"a Studio Elite wearing an Ultimate Weapon suit.\" In 2006 they introduced two models named Mongoose and Mongoose Retro, the former leaning towards Gibson-style design, while the latter is more of a Fender-design, both being \"a sort of Les Paul-meets-Telecaster\" and taking over for the Telecaster-styled Tylerbastar line. By now the manufacturing process had also started to utilize a Fadal digital CNC machine for routing the guitar bodies, allowing for additional optional features like a hollow body. The company now also winds their own pickups, while earlier they used standard and custom pickups from manufacturers like Seymour Duncan, DiMarzio, Lindy Fralin, Tom Anderson and John Suhr.\n\nThe company's first original finish was created in 1991 for Michael Landau as a joke that Tyler has commented \"unfortunately, the world took it seriously\". It got named \"psychedelic vomit\", and Jordan McLachlan of \"Guitarist\" magazine described it as \"completely mad and random\". The second finish was created in 1993, again for Michael Landau, and was named \"burning water\", and is a combination of different colours which Neville Marten described as \"a mass of swirls in different metallic colours\". In 1998 the first \"shmear\" finish was created, a paint job that uses layers of different kinds of paint and takes about a week to finish.\n\nIn 2008 the company released a series of guitars using the brand \"Joe\" and only made them available to the Japanese market. These guitars are a more minimal version of the Studio Elite and the Strat-style Classic models.\n\nA Tyler-designed series of Line 6's Variax line of guitars was announced in the spring of 2010.\n\nThe company also produced a limited number of custom-built bass guitars between 1992 and 2006, used for instance by David Hungate and Neil Stubenhaus.\n\nIn 2011 Tyler Guitars relocated their operation and offices to a new facility in San Fernando Valley. In 2014 James Tyler partnered with Japanese distributor Daisuke Kitahara to manufacture affordable versions of their popular models in Japan before establishing Tyler Guitars Japan two years later. \n\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Uma Thurman as the Bride, who swears revenge on a team of assassins (Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, and Vivica A. Fox) and their leader Bill (David Carradine) after they try to kill her and her unborn child. Her journey takes her to Japan, where she battles the Tokyo yakuza.\n\nTarantino conceived \"Kill Bill\" as an homage to grindhouse cinema including martial arts films, samurai cinema, blaxploitation films, and spaghetti westerns. It features an anime sequence animated by Production I.G. It is the first of two \"Kill Bill\" films made in a single production; the films were originally set for a single release, but the film, with a runtime of over four hours, was divided in two. \"Volume 1\" became Tarantino's highest-grossing film up to that point, earning over $180 million at the box office. \"\" was released on April 16, 2004.\n\nA woman in a wedding dress, the Bride, lies wounded in a chapel in El Paso, Texas, having been attacked by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. She tells their leader, Bill, that she is pregnant with his baby. Bill shoots her in the head.\n\nFour years later, having survived the attack, the Bride goes to the home of Vernita Green, planning to kill her. Both women were members of the assassination squad, which has since disbanded; Vernita now leads a normal suburban family life. They engage in a knife fight, but are interrupted by the arrival of Vernita's young daughter, Nikki. The Bride agrees to meet Vernita at night to settle the matter, but Vernita tries to surprise the Bride with a pistol hidden in a box of cereal. The Bride dodges the shot and throws a knife into Vernita's chest, killing her.\n\nFour years earlier, police investigate the massacre at the wedding chapel. The sheriff discovers the Bride is alive but comatose. In the hospital, Deadly Viper Elle Driver prepares to assassinate the Bride via lethal injection, but Bill aborts the mission at the last moment, considering it dishonorable to kill the Bride when she cannot defend herself.\n\nIn the present, the Bride awakens from her four-year coma and is horrified to find she is no longer pregnant. She kills a hospital worker who has been raping her while she was comatose, takes his truck, and teaches herself to walk again. Resolving to kill Bill and all four members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, she picks her first target: O-Ren Ishii, now the leader of the Tokyo yakuza. O-Ren's parents were murdered by the yakuza when she was a child; she took vengeance on the yakuza boss and replaced him after training as an elite assassin.\n\nThe Bride travels to Okinawa, Japan, to obtain a sword from legendary swordsmith Hattori Hanzō, who has sworn never to forge a sword again. After learning that her target is Bill, his former student, he crafts his finest sword for her. The Bride tracks down O-Ren at a Tokyo restaurant, the House of Blue Leaves, and defeats and kills her yakuza army, including the elite Crazy 88 and O-Ren's bodyguard, schoolgirl Gogo Yubari. She duels with O-Ren in the restaurant's Japanese garden, and slices the top of her head off with a sword stroke. She tortures Sofie Fatale, O-Ren's assistant, for information about Bill, and leaves her alive as a threat. Bill asks Sofie if the Bride knows her daughter is alive.\n\n\nWriter-director Quentin Tarantino and star Thurman conceived \"Kill Bill\" during the production of Tarantino's 1994 film \"Pulp Fiction;\" the film credits the story to \"Q & U\". Tarantino spent a year and a half writing the script while he was living in New York City. He spent time with Thurman and her newborn daughter, which influenced the Bride character; Tarantino did not come to the realization that the Bride's daughter could still be alive until five months into writing. He originally wrote Bill to be played by Warren Beatty, but as the character developed and the role required greater screen time and martial arts training, he rewrote it for David Carradine.\n\nAn early draft included a chapter set after the confrontation with Vernita in which the Bride has a gunfight with Gogo Yubari's vengeful sister Yuki. The scene was cut for time and budget reasons. Tarantino said: \"I'm dealing with a three and a half-hour movie. Yuki's revenge is going to be the first to go. I'm going to kill myself shooting it, it's going to cost $1 million and it's going to be the first thing to go, so I can't do it.\" Another draft featured a scene in which the Bride's \"Pussy Wagon\" is blown up by Elle Driver.\n\nWhen Thurman became pregnant as shooting was ready to begin, Tarantino delayed the production, saying: \"If Josef Von Sternberg is getting ready to make \"Morocco\" and Marlene Dietrich gets pregnant, he waits for Dietrich!\" Although the scenes are presented out of chronological order, the film was shot in sequence. Choreographer Woo-Ping Yuen, whose previous credits include \"The Matrix\" (1999), was the film's martial arts advisor. The anime sequence, covering O-Ren Ishii's backstory, was directed by Kazuto Nakazawa and produced by Production I.G, which had produced films including \"Ghost in the Shell\" and \"\". The combined production lasted 155 days and had a budget of $55 million.\n\nAccording to Tarantino, the most difficult part of making the film was \"trying to take myself to a different place as a filmmaker and throw my hat in the ring with other great action directors\", as opposed to the dialogue scenes he was known for. The House of Blue Leaves sequence, in which the Bride battles dozens of yakuza soldiers, took eight weeks to film, six weeks over schedule. Tarantino wanted to create \"one of the greatest, most exciting sequences in the history of cinema\". The crew eschewed computer generated imagery in favor of traditional practical effects used in 1970s Chinese cinema, particularly by director Chang Cheh, including the use of fire extinguishers and condoms to create spurts and explosions of blood. Tarantino told his crew: \"Let's pretend we're little kids and we're making a Super 8 movie in our back yard, and you don't have all this shit. How would you achieve this effect? Ingenuity is important here!\"\n\nNear the end of filming, Thurman was injured in a crash while filming the scene in which she drives to Bill. According to Thurman, she was uncomfortable driving the car and asked a stunt driver to do it; Tarantino assured her that the car and road were safe. She lost control of the car and hit a tree, suffering a concussion and damage to her knees. Thurman requested the crash footage, but Miramax would only release it, in Thurman's words, if she signed a document \"releasing them of any consequences of [Thurman's] future pain and suffering\". Tarantino was apologetic, but he and Thurman were acrimonious for years afterwards; she said after the accident she \"went from being a creative contributor and performer to being like a broken tool\". Miramax released the footage in 2018 after Thurman went to police following the accusations of sexual abuse by producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\"Kill Bill\" was planned and produced as a single film. After shooting ended and editing began, Harvey Weinstein, known for pressuring filmmakers to shorten their films, suggested that Tarantino split the film in two. This meant Tarantino did not have to cut scenes, such as the anime sequence. Tarantino told IGN: \"I'm talking about scenes that are some of the best scenes in the movie, but in this hurdling pace where you're trying to tell only one story, that would have been the stuff that would have had to go. But to me, that's kind of what the movie was, are these little detours and these little grace notes.\" The decision to split the film was announced in July 2003.\n\n\"Kill Bill\" was inspired by \"grindhouse\" cinema, a term for films that played in cheap US theaters in the 1970s, including martial arts films, samurai cinema, blaxploitation films, and spaghetti westerns. It homages the Shaw Brothers Studio, known for its martial arts films, with the inclusion of the ShawScope logo in its opening titles and the \"crashing zoom\", a fast zoom usually ending in a close-up commonly used in Shaw Brothers films.\n\nWhen the Bride encounters a member of the Deadly Vipers, a flashing red screen with superimposed flashback footage appears in homage to the 1965 spaghetti western \"Death Rides A Horse\", whose hero witnesses the massacre of his family. The theme from \"Death Rides A Horse\", composed by Ennio Morricone, plays when the Bride confronts O-Ren Ishii. \n\nThe Bride’s yellow tracksuit, helmet and motorcycle resemble the ones used by Bruce Lee in the 1978 kung fu film \"Game of Death\". The animated sequence homages violent anime films such as \"\" (1983) and \"Wicked City\" (1987). It was also inspired by the Indian film \"Aalavandhan\" (2001), another live-action film which features an animated murder sequence.\n\nThe \"Guardian\" wrote that \"Kill Bill\" shares much of its plot with the 1973 Japanese film \"Lady Snowblood,\" in which a woman kills off the gang who murdered her family, and observed that \"\"Lady Snowblood\" uses stills and illustration for parts of the narrative that were too expensive to film, just as \"Kill Bill\" uses Japanese-style animation to break up the narrative\". The plot also resembles the 1968 French film \"The Bride Wore Black,\" in which a bride seeks revenge on five gang members and strikes them off a list as she kills them.\n\nAs with Tarantino's previous films, \"Kill Bill\" features an eclectic soundtrack comprising many musical genres. On the two soundtracks, music ranges from country music to selections from the Spaghetti Western film scores of Ennio Morricone. Bernard Herrmann's theme from the film \"Twisted Nerve\" is whistled by the menacing Elle Driver in the hospital scene. A brief, 15-second excerpt from the opening of the \"Ironside\" theme music by Quincy Jones is used as the Bride's revenge motif, which flares up with a red-tinged flashback whenever she is in the company of her next target. Instrumental tracks from Japanese guitarist Tomoyasu Hotei figure prominently, and after the success of \"Kill Bill\" they were frequently used in American TV commercials and at sporting events. As the Bride enters \"The House of Blue Leaves\", go-go group the 5,6,7,8's perform \"I Walk Like Jayne Mansfield,\" \"I'm Blue (The Gong-Gong Song)\" and \"Woo Hoo\". The connection to \"Lady Snowblood \"is further established by the use of \"The Flower of Carnage\" the closing theme from that film. James Last's \"The Lonely Shepherd\" by pan flute virtuoso Gheorghe Zamfir plays over the closing credits.\n\n\"Kill Bill: Volume 1\" was released in theaters on , 2003. It was the first Tarantino film in six years, following \"Jackie Brown\" in 1997. In the United States and Canada, \"Volume 1\" was released in and grossed on its opening weekend. Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, said \"Volume 1\"s opening weekend gross was significant for a \"very genre specific and very violent\" film that in the United States was restricted to theatergoers 17 years old and up. It ranked first at the box office, beating \"School of Rock\" (in its second weekend) and \"Intolerable Cruelty\" (in its first). \"Volume 1\" had the widest theatrical release and highest-grossing opening weekend of a Tarantino film to date; \"Jackie Brown\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) had each grossed on their opening weekends. According to the studio, exit polls showed that 90% of the audience was interested in seeing the second \"Kill Bill\" after seeing the first.\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, \"Kill Bill: Volume 1\" was released in . The film outperformed its main competitor \"Intolerable Cruelty\" in Norway, Denmark and Finland, though it ranked second in Italy. \"Volume 1\" had a record opening in Japan, though expectations were higher due to the film being partially set there and because of its homages to Japanese martial arts cinema. It had \"a muted entry\" in the United Kingdom and Germany due to its 18 certificate, but \"experienced acceptable drops\" after its opening weekend in the two territories. By , 2003, it had made in the . It grossed a total of in the United States and Canada and in other territories for a worldwide total of .\n\nIn the United States, \"Volume 1\" was released on DVD and VHS on April 13, 2004, the week \"Volume 2\" was released in theaters. In a December 2005 interview, Tarantino addressed the lack of a special edition DVD for \"Kill Bill\" by stating \"I've been holding off because I've been working on it for so long that I just wanted a year off from \"Kill Bill\" and then I'll do the big supplementary DVD package.\" After one week of release, the film's DVD sales had surpassed its US box office gross.\n\nThe United States does not have a DVD boxed set of \"Kill Bill\", though box sets of the two separate volumes are available in other countries, such as France, Japan and the United Kingdom. Upon the DVD release of \"Volume 2\" in the US, however, Best Buy did offer an exclusive box set slipcase to house the two individual releases together. \"Volume 1\", along with \"Volume 2\", was released in High Definition on Blu-ray on September 9, 2008 in the United States. As of March 2012, \"Volume 1\" sold 141,456 Blu-ray units in the US, grossing $1,477,791.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \"Kill Bill: Volume 1\" has a score of 85% based on reviews from 233 critics; the average rating is 7.7/10. Its consensus reads: \"\"Kill Bill\" is admittedly little more than a stylish revenge thriller – albeit one that benefits from a wildly inventive surfeit of style.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has an average score of 69 based on 43 reviews.\n\nA. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"While being so relentlessly exposed to a filmmaker's idiosyncratic turn-ons can be tedious and off-putting, the undeniable passion that drives \"Kill Bill\" is fascinating, even, strange to say it, endearing. Mr. Tarantino is an irrepressible showoff, recklessly flaunting his formal skills as a choreographer of high-concept violence, but he is also an unabashed cinephile, and the sincerity of his enthusiasm gives this messy, uneven spectacle an odd, feverish integrity.\"\n\nManohla Dargis of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called \"Kill Bill: Volume 1\" \"a blood-soaked valentine to movies\" and wrote: \"It's apparent that Tarantino is striving for more than an off-the-rack mash note or a pastiche of golden oldies. It is, rather, his homage to movies shot in celluloid and wide, wide, wide, wide screen—an ode to the time right before movies were radically secularized.\" She recognized Tarantino's technical talent but thought \"Kill Bill: Volume 1\"s appeal was too limited to popular culture references, calling the film's story \"the least interesting part of the whole equation.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 4 stars out of 4, writing: \"\"Kill Bill, Volume 1\" shows Quentin Tarantino so effortlessly and brilliantly in command of his technique that he reminds me of a virtuoso violinist racing through 'Flight of the Bumble Bee' – or maybe an accordion prodigy setting a speed record for 'Lady of Spain'. I mean that as a sincere compliment. The movie is not about anything at all except the skill and humor of its making. It's kind of brilliant.\"\n\nCultural historian Maud Lavin states that the Bride's embodiment of revenge taps into viewers' personal fantasies of committing violence. For audiences, particularly women viewers, the character provides a complex site for identification with one's own aggression.\n\nUma Thurman received a Golden Globe Best Actress nomination in 2004. She was also nominated in 2004 for a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, in addition with four other BAFTA nominations. \"Kill: Bill Volume 1\" was placed in Empire Magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time at number 325 and the Bride was also ranked number 66 in Empire magazine's \"100 Greatest Movie Characters\".\n\n\"Kill Buljo\" is a 2007 Norwegian parody of \"Kill Bill\" set in Finnmark, Norway, and portrays Jompa Tormann's hunt for Tampa and Papa Buljo. The film satirizes stereotypes of Norway's Sami population. According to the Norwegian newspaper \"Dagbladet\", Tarantino approved of the parody. \n\nThe Pussy Wagon vehicle from \"Kill Bill: Volume 1\" made a cameo in the music video for Lady Gaga's song \"Telephone\" at Tarantino's behest.\n\n\n"}

Natalie first appeared in January 1994, depicted initially as an unhappy, insecure teenager; she was among various regular characters brought in to increase the cast following the BBC's decision to increase episode output to 3 per week. She featured most often with the characters Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer); Natalie's affair with Ricky ending his relationship with Bianca was one of the prominent storylines aired in the Winter of 1995. Despite producers offering to extend Speed's contact, she opted to leave the serial in 1995.\n\nExecutive producer Matthew Robinson reintroduced the character in 1999 as a business woman and a love interest for Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson). Speed left once again in 2004, with Natalie departing in the wake of Barry's murder by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks).\n\nNatalie's parents separated early in her childhood and she took it badly. She lived with her mother Andrea (Cindy O'Callaghan) in Walford, but she had been closer to her father, Dave, and missed him terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter Susie (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined her figure and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for missing her father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave had no interest in Natalie.\n\nAt age 11 when she was in secondary school, Natalie met Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). They became friends, but Bianca often sidelined her in favour of Tiffany Raymond (Martine McCutcheon), whom Bianca treated with more respect than Natalie. In fact, Tiffany joined Bianca in teasing Natalie. Natalie resented Tiffany and was pleased when she moved away after leaving school at 16 in 1993.\n\nMischievous Natalie often entices Bianca into trouble, but Bianca is more domineering, often putting Natalie down. Lonely, Natalie makes up an imaginary boyfriend for attention, claiming he has taken her on extravagant dates. This makes Bianca envious initially, but when Natalie's lies are discovered, Bianca takes great pleasure in humiliating her.\n\nWhen Tiffany reappears, Natalie feels sidelined by Bianca as she did in school. Bianca's boyfriend Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) also tires of Bianca's selfishness and this inadvertently drives him and Natalie closer together. They console each other and in February 1995, they begin an affair. Ricky is Natalie's first sexual partner and for her it is true love, but Ricky does not take it as seriously. Natalie starts pressuring Ricky to tell Bianca about their relationship and when he does not, Natalie plants some lingerie in his work overalls. Bianca finds it and suspects Ricky is having an affair; she takes Natalie's advice to follow Ricky so she can catch him with the mystery woman. Bianca does this one night and catches them kissing and is incensed. In the aftermath, Ricky dumps Natalie and Bianca threatens her, ordering her to leave Walford. Dejected, Natalie does so, leaving Walford to stay with her sister in Basingstoke.\n\nIn 1999, Natalie reappears as a new self-confident business woman, running a dating agency. Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson), unaware of Natalie's history, uses her agency, \"Romantic Relations\". Despite Natalie's attempts to set Barry up with other female hopefuls, she eventually becomes attracted to him herself and they begin dating. Natalie's reappearance is met unfavourably by Bianca and fights ensue. However, they eventually call a truce and become friends again. Natalie's business does not prosper and closes soon after.\nDespite initial problems caused by Natalie's overbearing mother who tries to take over the wedding plans, Natalie and Barry marry on New Year's Eve in 1999, in a joint wedding with Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). They live with Barry's father Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) and stepmother Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement) and are relatively happy until Natalie becomes pregnant. Preferring to concentrate on her career, and unable to make Barry realise how she feels, Natalie plans an abortion. When Barry comes to the clinic, pledging to support her decision, Natalie changes her mind and does not have the termination. Barry is overjoyed and agrees to give up work and look after the baby so she can work, giving birth to son Jack (Samuel and Joseph Timson) early in 2002—the birth is traumatic as Jack was born feet first. Motherhood is hard for Natalie; she begins to feel that she has two children, Jack and Barry. When Barry's half-brother, Nathan Williams (Doug Allen), moves in briefly, he makes Natalie an unsuspecting pawn in his vendetta. Determined to ruin Barry, Nathan tries to seduce Natalie and they kiss briefly but she soon realises that Nathan wants to ruin Barry and banishes him from their lives. Barry forgives Natalie; their marriage remains intact but Natalie grows increasingly unhappy with Barry's immaturity.\n\nFeeling stifled and trapped, she turns to Ricky. They rekindle their affair and decide to leave Albert Square with their sons. On the night of her 26th birthday, while Barry plans a secret party in The Queen Victoria public house, Natalie prepares to leave. Barry discovers what is happening just as Natalie is leaving. Desperate to prove his love, he drags Natalie into the pub and begs her to stay. Natalie breaks Barry's heart by admitting that she does not love him and despite his pleading, refuses to give their marriage another chance. During the chaos, Ricky's sister, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), ruins their plans by telling Natalie about Ricky's one-night stand with Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) days before. Confronted by Barry but unable to trust Ricky and racked with guilt, Natalie ends things with Ricky and leaves Walford alone, later divorcing Barry. When Roy dies from a heart attack the following day, Natalie later returns to his funeral and decides to stay in Walford for a while. Janine encourages the divorce and sets a plan in motion to manipulate Barry and steal his money, aided by Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle), Janine's true boyfriend. This eventually leads to Barry's untimely demise, when Janine pushes him from a cliff and leaves him to die, days after they marry on New Year's Eve 2003 in Scotland. Janine inherits Barry's wealth, leaving Natalie and Jack nothing.\n\nSuspecting foul play, Natalie tries to prove Janine has murdered Barry but is unsuccessful. She refuses to leave with Ricky, who leaves following Janine's confession of what really happened to Barry (but keeps this to himself). While Natalie comes to terms with Barry's death, she gets close to Paul, who is desperate to make amends to Natalie and Jack for his part in Barry's death. Despite his feelings for Natalie, Paul struggles with his guilt and when Natalie gets suspicious about Paul's relationship with Janine, he finally reveals Janine's role in Barry's death and makes a statement to the police. Janine is questioned but released due to lack of evidence. She promptly tells Natalie that Paul conspired with her from the start and gloats about getting away with murder. Devastated, and unable to prove Janine's guilt to the police, Natalie leaves Paul and Albert Square in March 2004. She returns briefly in May to witness Janine's incarceration after she is falsely accused of murdering Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman). Natalie makes peace with Paul, holding a ceremony for Barry by scattering his ashes under a tree planted in his memory. She and Jack leave but it is indicated that Pat stays in touch with Natalie when she goes to stay with her off-screen in 2007, following an accident.\n\n1994 was a \"historic\" year for \"EastEnders\", as in April a third weekly episode was introduced. Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994. Among them was Natalie Price, who made her first appearance in January 1994 as the best friend of Bianca (Patsy Palmer). The character was introduced under executive producer, Leonard Lewis.\n\nThe actress Lucy Speed – seventeen at the time – was chosen to play the part. Speed claims that she was cast due to her “cranky” attitude during her audition. She comments “I showed up there with an attitude, not giving ‘a stuff’ whether I got the damn part and they responded to that. They liked it, liked my feistiness, they thought it was the quality they were looking for...Natalie was a pretty gloomy kid, not a sunny show-biz kid which is all they'd been seeing until I walked through the door. So I got the part.”\n\nThe character has been described by \"EastEnders\" author, Rupert Smith, as an “eternal victim” – a female character who endures much misfortune and misery, but lacks the “pluck” of her “feistier sisters”. Early on in her narrative, Natalie was shown to be an insecure and lonely individual– a “gloomy kid” from a broken family with an uncaring, criticising and resentful mother, Andrea (Cindy O'Callaghan). The character was often seen to be “shunted aside by stronger personalities”, such as her best friend Bianca – who was shown to bully and torment Natalie, telling her “that she was plain and wouldn't attract boys”, although in later years Natalie was shown to stand up to Bianca's bullying.\n\nSimilarly, she was shown to be unsuccessful in relationships, falling for unsuitable men who ended up hurting her and settling in a “secure but uninspired” marriage to a mismatched, immature partner, Barry Evans. She was frequently shown to feel constrained and trapped by her marriage and motherhood – her initial reluctance to be a mother stemming from her own unhappy childhood. Though the character occasionally showed “a rare flash of spirit”, the results were usually detrimental – an affair with her “first true love”, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), ended the character's marriage and left her to face “a dreary future as a single mother.” Lucy Speed has commented on her character's personality: “she's a thinker and quite vulnerable, but she's grown up a lot. She's also had storylines where she's dealt with family skeletons and she did find a man who was able to give her stability and the chance for her to grow up a bit. Ultimately though, I hope that I've shown that who she is now explains who she was then…she's gone from being a young girl with zero confidence in herself to a young woman with a certain measure of confidence, back to someone with zero confidence. Life doesn't go easy on her but she's got strength. She's a feisty little thing and she gets on with things.”\n\nInitially, Natalie's principal purpose in the serial was to be Bianca Jackson's “put-upon sidekick” – Bianca was already an established character, having been introduced two months prior to Natalie's first appearance. The most notable storyline featuring Natalie during her initial stint in \"EastEnders\" was her affair with Bianca's boyfriend, Ricky. On-screen Natalie and Ricky found themselves sidelined and bullied by Bianca, forcing them together and leading to their eventual affair, which continued for several weeks on-screen, with Ricky seeing both Natalie and Bianca. The storyline reached its climax on 16 Feb 1995; 17.0 million viewers tuned in to witness Bianca discovering that her boyfriend was sleeping with her best friend. The aftermath of the storyline led to Natalie's departure from the serial. On-screen Ricky discovered that Natalie orchestrated Bianca's discovery of their affair and finished with her, and in the midst of Bianca's wrath, Natalie fled from Walford in shame on 23 February 1995.\n\nOff-screen, actress Lucy Speed had decided to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was reportedly “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and you have to learn to deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!”\n\nAfter a four-year absence, Lucy Speed decided that she wanted to return to the series. She mentioned this to her former castmate Ross Kemp, who played Grant Mitchell in the serial and he initiated contact between Speed and then executive-producer, Matthew Robinson. Robinson had been thinking of introducing a new love-interest for the character Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson) and he had already considered the possibility that the love interest could be Natalie. Speed has commented “It was good timing. He thought I and the character fit the bill.” Natalie made her reappearance on-screen on 8 March 1999 and a relationship between the two characters was developed. A friendship was also re-established between the characters Natalie and Bianca in a special four-hander episode – although “the closeness was never quite the same”.\n\nNatalie's relationship with Barry Evans- frequently described as a “bumbling buffoon” – was central to the character upon her return to the serial. Speed has explained her character's initial attraction to Barry: \"I think it has a lot to do with her childhood. Natalie really adored her dad but he couldn't put up with that horrible wife of his, Andrea… and so he walked out on the family. Andrea is a total nightmare control freak, and it says a lot about who Natalie is, why she had no confidence in herself. Her mother probably emotionally abused her. So Barry represented safety and a secure family environment…She feels safe with him and she felt she made the right choice at the time, although of course she was apprehensive about it.”\n\nThe biggest storyline involving Barry and Natalie in 1999 was their joint double wedding with the characters Ian Beale and Melanie Healy (Adam Woodyatt and Tamzin Outhwaite) – the lead up to which included a hen/stag night celebration episode, which was filmed on-location in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The episode evoked criticism by the Broadcasting Standards Commission for its inclusion of “almost relentless drunken and promiscuous behaviour, sexual innuendo and drug-taking, before the watershed”, which included Natalie having to acquire three love bites from strangers. The BBC defended the episode, claiming that its content would have “come as no surprise to viewers” and adding that the depiction of this behaviour conformed to an \"EastEnders\" tradition – that questionable conduct \"only leads to further trouble…One character's quest for drugs led to embarrassment and nausea and a drinking binge led to the calling off of [Barry and Natalie’s] wedding while the prospects for another became bleaker.\"\n\nNatalie and Barry's screen wedding was featured as part of the Millennium Eve episodes, which drew in 20.89 million viewers – the biggest soap audience since the character Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) was killed off in \"EastEnders\" precisely one year earlier (New Year's Eve 1998). An \"EastEnders\" spokeswoman commented: \"This is a remarkable endorsement of the power of \"EastEnders\" that over 20 million viewers chose to see the Millennium celebrations in Albert Square.\" The episodes were also broadcast on screens in London's Trafalgar Square, a typical “haunt for New Year's Eve revellers”.\n\nIn 2001, a pregnancy was written into the character's narrative. Natalie was shown to be distressed by the prospect of being a mother and planned to have an abortion. Speed commented \"Natalie desperately wants a baby but the thought of becoming a mother makes her unhappy. Her family background is so awful she doesn't want to make the same mistake her mother made, but feels the odds are stacked against her and Barry.\" Viewers saw a “devastated Barry” react badly to the news in a special extended four-hander episode (written by Christopher Reason and directed by Clive Arnold) – the episode had a maternal theme with the action flitting between Barry and Natalie's saga and scenes between Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and his dying mother, which included revelations of child abuse and incest. An \"EastEnders\" spokesman said: \"We are very proud of the programme. The storylines involving Steve and his mother and Barry and Natalie are the stuff of intense drama. All four actors give incredible performances.\"\n\nThe following episode Barry was seen to chase Natalie to the abortion clinic, where he persuaded her to go through with the pregnancy. The scenes between Natalie and Barry have been described as some of “the most powerful moments in soap, with the couple battling to decide the fate of their unborn baby”. The character was seen to give birth to son Jack in January 2002 and her decision to keep her baby in spite of her initial determination to abort has been mocked by Susannah Nightingale – columnist for the Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) women's campaign. She sarcastically comments “how lucky that she didn't go through with that patently psychotic urge for an abortion when she first realised she was pregnant […] It's funny, because Nat seemed so sure at the time: she wasn't ready for a baby, she needed to establish her career and move out of her husband's family home before becoming a mother. Perfectly reasonable, you might think […] but no! Our plucky hero Barry comes to her rescue, gently persuading her that she's just a little over-emotional and, phew – thank God he did, because here we are with a happy new family that might otherwise never have been. Dappy Natalie nearly screwed everything up. Men, even such sorry specimens as the perpetually pouting Barry, really are jolly decent to put up with these female follies and calmly guide their gals in the right direction\".\n\nNightingale suggested that the storyline \"echoed\" the assertion that a woman cannot be trusted to make her own decision about abortion, which she describes as profoundly undermining and a \"subtle\" reinforcement of an \"underlying implication\" that women should be punished for exercising their legal right. She comments, \"I am confused by the writers' unswerving insistence on her absolute certainty that abortion was the right choice for her, until the very last moment – such portrayals smack of her finally 'seeing the light'. Had the Natalie presented been a confused or uncertain woman, her change of heart would have seemed infinitely more credible, but she was neither. In fact, the very plausibility of the script was sacrificed, presumably to make a point – and the only one I can dig out is that of the dangers of going through with an abortion, even if you think you're sure – come on, what do you know?\".\n\nViewers saw Natalie and Barry's marriage sour towards the end of 2002 when she was momentarily tempted by the charms of his scheming half-brother Nathan (Doug Allen), and then, in the New Year's Eve episode, she was shown to rekindle a secret “steamy affair” with old flame, Ricky, which continued into 2003. Speed commented “Natalie's always had strong feelings for Ricky. And now she's grown tired of being a mother to baby Jack and Barry!…family is everything to her, so she would have to feel very strongly indeed about someone to put her marriage at risk. As for Ricky, I suppose Natalie's always held a torch for him. He was her first love who finished with her, so she's been left with a kind of 'what if?' feeling. When Natalie was younger she was easily seduced, and a little bit of that remains. She can be easily swayed if someone is nice.\"\n\nThe storyline reached its climax in March 2003. On-screen the character's plans to abscond with Ricky and her son (on the night of her surprise birthday party) were thwarted by Barry's discovery of the affair – leading to a public confrontation between the three protagonists. Shaun Williamson who played Barry has commented “Barry is absolutely devastated as his whole life is ripped apart. He can’t believe Nat has betrayed him. He loves his life with Natalie and Jack, and would do anything to make it work as a family again. Losing Natalie is going to be really difficult for Barry, but I think the hardest thing will be losing his son.” The storyline signified the end of the characters’ three-year marriage and in a final plot twist Natalie opted to finish with Ricky and leave Walford alone, having discovered that he had recently slept with his ex-wife Samantha.\n\nThe character's second exit was the climax to a storyline that has been described as one of the show's “most dramatic”. Natalie's ex-husband Barry remarried and was killed by his new bride Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) on their honeymoon. The character was embroiled in a bid to uncover Janine as Barry's killer, and became romantically involved with the character Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle) – Janine's repentant accomplice in Barry's downfall, who was also her former lover. A BBC insider said: \"Natalie is Janine's arch rival. She smelt a rat as soon as Janine returned to Walford playing the grieving widow. And she is determined to find out what happened to Barry and get justice for him.\" After discovering the truth from Paul, Natalie realised she was powerless to bring Janine to justice and decided to leave the Square in March 2004. Speed commented, \"Natalie just wants herself and Jack out of Walford. It's full of bad memories Natalie is devastated by the revelations about Barry's death. She can't believe Paul still thinks they could be together. She did care for him, but now she knows about his scheming with Janine, he's history. She leaves without saying goodbye to him\". The character returned briefly in May to ensure Janine received her comeuppance and made her final screen appearance on 10 May 2004.\n\nOff-screen, actress Lucy Speed had decided to quit the role after six years playing Natalie. She comments “'I'd been back for five years and had very little to do the year before. I quite like being busy and I could see the scriptwriters were struggling with Natalie and where to place her so it seemed like the right time to go. It's nice that they've left it open, I'd hate to think the door was shut behind me. Absolutely, I'd like to go back, never say never. Maybe I'll track Janine down.”\n\nTo mark the character's exit a special documentary was aired in March 2004, entitled \"EastEnders Revealed: Natalie Evans\". The programme looked back over 10 years of the character's time in the soap and featured interviews from Speed and tributes from her former castmates Shaun Williamson (Barry), Charlie Brooks (Janine), Natalie Cassidy (Sonia Jackson), Gary Beadle (Paul), Pam St. Clement (Pat) and Tony Caunter (Roy).\n\nIn 1995, Chris Barker carried out television research on post-transmission perspectives of teenage viewers of \"EastEnders\", using the character Natalie as one of the focus points. He discovered that the participants were both active and implicit in the reproduction of ideology about family relationships and gender, identified via discussion of the friendship between Bianca and Natalie. Girls viewed Natalie more favourably than Bianca in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \"girl-culture\" – attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public – manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a \"nice person\" in contrast to Bianca, \"[Natalie] can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't just think about herself [like Bianca does]\", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women.\n\nLinda Ruth Williams, author of \"The erotic thriller in contemporary cinema\", was critical of a scene featuring Natalie speaking in a derogatory manner about the erotic thriller film genre. In an episode that aired in 2000, Natalie's husband Barry suggested that he and Natalie get intimate in a video store. Natalie retorted that \"pinning me up against the erotic thriller section\" was not her idea of a romantic setting for sex. Ruth Williams suggested that Natalie's casual dismissal of the erotic thriller genre as \"lurid\" was a discourse shared by the general population; she stated that witnessing this scene inspired her to pen the aforementioned book, which was the first of its kind to examine the film genre.\n\nNatalie Evans peaked at 52 on \"EastEnders: The Greatest Cliffhangers\" in 2010.\n\nIn 2002 the character was featured in a spoof of the Michael Jackson hit video, \"Thriller\", which was made as part of the annual fund-raising event, Children in Need. Shaun Williamson as Barry played the Michael Jackson role, while Lucy Speed as Natalie took on Ola Ray’s role as his date. Unlike the original video – where Jackson was seen to turn into a zombie – the spoof saw Natalie transformed into the walking dead. A dozen cast-members took part in the spoof where they recreated the dance routine made famous in the original video. Speed has commented “I really enjoyed that. We were there on our day off but it was brilliant fun. I used to be a dancer and to be able to do some moves on the Square was good. We all wanted to look as horrific and disgusting as possible. Shaun split his trousers while doing it as well. I think they were really tight though.”\n\n"}

Launched in 2010, it replaced the WOW Philippines campaign that was launched in 2002.\n\nThe tourism slogan used in the campaign was controversial and received mostly negative reception from the Filipino public, even leading to the resignation of the country's then-Tourism Secretary, Alberto Lim. Pilipinas Kay Ganda was eventually replaced with \"It's More Fun in the Philippines\". \n\nThe advertising agency Campaigns & Grey had advisory capacity over the campaign.

The agency claimed that the released logo was just a study and was released prematurely by the Department of Tourism.\n\nThe Pilipinas Kay Ganda campaign logo design was criticized for alleged plagiarism.

The logos of Polska and Pilipinas Kay Ganda's font were similar. Both the letter \"L\" of the campaign slogans were stylized into trees.

{"id": "31775043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31775043", "title": "Prometheus (2012 film)", "text": "Prometheus (2012 film)\n\nPrometheus ( ) is a 2012 science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott, written by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof and starring Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, Logan Marshall-Green, and Charlize Theron. It is set in the late 21st century and centers on the crew of the spaceship \"Prometheus\" as it follows a star map discovered among the artifacts of several ancient Earth cultures. Seeking the origins of humanity, the crew arrives on a distant world and discovers a threat that could cause the extinction of the human species.\n\nDevelopment of the film began in the early 2000s as a fifth installment in the \"Alien\" franchise. Scott and director James Cameron developed ideas for a film that would serve as a prequel to Scott's 1979 science-fiction horror film \"Alien\". In 2002, the development of \"Alien vs. Predator\" took precedence, and the project remained dormant until 2009 when Scott again showed interest. Spaihts wrote a script for a prequel to the events of the \"Alien\" films, but Scott opted for a different direction to avoid repeating cues from those films. In late 2010, Lindelof joined the project to rewrite Spaihts's script, and he and Scott developed a story that precedes the story of \"Alien\" but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, although the film shares \"strands of \"Alien\"s DNA, so to speak\", and takes place in the same universe, \"Prometheus\" explores its own mythology and ideas.\n\n\"Prometheus\" entered production in April 2010, with extensive design phases during which the technology and creatures that the film required were developed. Principal photography began in March 2011, with an estimated $120–130 million budget. The project was shot using 3D cameras throughout, almost entirely on practical sets, and on location in England, Iceland, Spain, and Scotland. It was promoted with a marketing campaign that included viral activities on the web. Three videos featuring the film's leading actors in character, which expanded on elements of the fictional universe, were released and met with a generally positive reception and awards.\n\n\"Prometheus\" was released on June 1, 2012, in the United Kingdom and on June 8, 2012, in North America. The film received praise for the aesthetic design and the acting, especially Fassbender's performance as the android David, while plot elements that remained unresolved or predictable were the main source of criticism. The film grossed over $403 million worldwide. A sequel, \"\", was released in May 2017.\n\nAs a spacecraft departs a planet, a humanoid alien drinks an iridescent liquid, causing its body to dissolve. As its remains cascade into a waterfall, the alien's DNA falls apart and recombines.\n\nIn 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star map in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the \"Engineers.\" Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition, aboard the scientific vessel \"Prometheus,\" to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223. The ship's crew travels in stasis while the android David monitors their voyage. Arriving in December 2093, mission-director Meredith Vickers informs them of their mission to find the Engineers and not to make contact without her permission.\n\nThe \"Prometheus\" lands on the barren, mountainous surface near a large, artificial structure, which a team explores. Inside, they find stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to \"Prometheus\", but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure, while the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with the liquid and gives it to the unsuspecting Holloway, who had stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.\n\nInside the structure, a snake-like creature kills Millburn and sprays a corrosive fluid that melts Fifield's helmet. Fifield falls face-first into a puddle of dark liquid. When the crew returns, they find Millburn's corpse. David separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis, and a large 3D holographic star map highlighting Earth. Meanwhile, Holloway sickens rapidly. He is rushed back to \"Prometheus\", but Vickers refuses to let him aboard, and at his urging, burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later, a medical scan reveals that Shaw, despite being sterile, is pregnant. Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland has been in stasis aboard \"Prometheus.\" He explains that he wants to ask the Engineers how to prevent his death from old age. As Weyland prepares to leave for the structure, Vickers addresses him as \"Father\".\n\nA monstrous, mutated Fifield returns to the \"Prometheus\" and kills several crew members before he is killed. The \"Prometheus\" captain, Janek, speculates that the structure was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in an attempt to explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the \"Prometheus\" into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts an ovipositor down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.\n\nIn the lifeboat, an alien creature bursts out of the Engineer's chest.\n\n\n\n\nOther cast members include Kate Dickie as the ship's medic, Ford; Emun Elliott and Benedict Wong as, respectively, ship pilots Chance and Ravel; and Patrick Wilson as Shaw's father. Ian Whyte and Daniel James portray Engineers.\n\nThe central theme in \"Prometheus\" concerns the eponymous Titan of Greek mythology who defies the gods and gifts humanity with fire, for which he is subjected to eternal punishment. The gods want to limit their creations in case they attempt to usurp the gods. The film deals with humanity's relationship with the gods—their creators—and the consequence of defying them. A human expedition intends to find God and receive knowledge about belief, immortality and death. They find superior beings who appear god-like in comparison to humanity, and the \"Prometheus\" crew suffer consequences for their pursuit. Shaw is directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants her religious beliefs affirmed, and believes she is entitled to answers from God; her questions remain unanswered and she is punished for her hubris. The film offers similar resolution, providing items of information but leaving the connections and conclusions to the audience, potentially leaving the question unanswered. Further religious allusions are implied by the Engineers' decision to punish humanity with destruction 2,000 years before the events of the film. Scott suggested that an Engineer was sent to Earth to stop humanity's increasing aggression, but was crucified, implying it was Jesus Christ. However, Scott felt that an explicit connection in the film would be \"a little too on the nose.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence, a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, is particularly evident in \"Prometheus\", primarily through the android David. David is like humans but does not want to be like them, eschewing a common theme in \"robotic storytelling\" such as \"Blade Runner\". David is created in the image of humanity, and while the human crew of the \"Prometheus\" ship searches for their creators expecting answers, David exists among his human creators yet is underwhelmed; he questions his creators about why they are seeking their own. Lindelof described the ship as a prison for David. At the conclusion of the film, David's creator (Weyland) is dead and his fundamental programming will end without someone to serve. Lindelof explained that David's programming becomes unclear and that he could be programmed by Shaw or his own sense of curiosity. Following Weyland's death, David is left with Shaw, and is sincere and interested in following her, partly out of survival and partly out of curiosity.\n\nAnother theme is creation and the question of \"Who Am I? Who Made Me? Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?\" Development of the in-universe mythology explored the Judeo-Christian creation of man, but Scott was interested in Greco-Roman and Aztec creation myths about gods who create man in their own image by sacrificing a piece of themselves. This creation is shown in the film's opening in which an Engineer sacrifices itself after consuming the dark liquid, acting as a \"gardener in space\" to bring life to a world. One of their expeditions creates humanity, who create artificial life (David) in their own image. David then introduces the dark liquid to Holloway who impregnates a sterile Shaw, and the resulting child impregnates an Engineer, creating the child of all three generations. Scott likened the Engineers to the dark angels of John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", and said that humanity was their offspring and not God's.\n\nShaw is the only religious believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she was created by the Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that \"Prometheus\" is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.\n\nBeside drawing several influences from \"Paradise Lost\", \"The Atlantic\"s Govindini Murty noted further influences, and wrote that \"[t]he striking images Ridley Scott devises for \"Prometheus\" reference everything from Stanley Kubrick's \"\" to Leonardo da Vinci's \"Vitruvian Man\" and Mario Bava's \"Planet of the Vampires\". Scott also expands on the original \"Alien\" universe by creating a distinctly English mythology informed by Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" and the symbolic drawings of William Blake.\"\n\nDevelopment on a fifth film in the \"Alien\" franchise was in progress by 2002. Scott considered returning to the series he created with his 1979 science fiction horror film \"Alien\", to pursue a sequel that would explore the engineered origins of the series's Alien creatures, and the \"space jockey\"—the extraterrestrial being, who briefly appears in \"Alien\", as the deceased pilot of a derelict spaceship. \"Alien\" star Sigourney Weaver also expressed interest in returning to the series. \"Aliens\" director James Cameron discussed the potential for a sequel with Scott, and began working with another writer on a story for the film. It was then that 20th Century Fox approached Cameron with a script for a crossover film that would pit the series's monsters against the title characters of the \"Predator\" films; this project became the 2004 science fiction film \"Alien vs. Predator\". After Fox confirmed that it would pursue the crossover, Cameron stopped working on his own project, believing the crossover would \"kill the validity of the franchise.\" In 2006, Cameron confirmed that he would not return to the \"Alien\" sequel project, believing that the series was Fox's asset, and he was unwilling to deal with the studio's attempts to influence the potential sequel.\n\nIn May 2009, Fox said that the project was a \"reboot\" of the \"Alien\" franchise, and soon afterwards was reported as an untitled prequel to \"Alien\". Development stopped in June 2009 when Fox clashed with Scott over his selection of former television advertisement director Carl Erik Rinsch as director. Fox was only interested in pursuing the project if Scott directed. By July 2009, Scott was contracted to direct the film, and screenwriter Jon Spaihts was hired to write the script based on his pitched idea for a direct \"Alien\" prequel. With the director and writer in place, and pleased with Spaihts's pitch, Fox scheduled a release date for December 2011, but this was eventually canceled. In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and that pre-production would begin, and a filming date was set for January 2011. Fox eventually pushed to develop the project into an original work, and by July 2010, Lindelof had been hired to redevelop Spaihts's screenplay. In October 2010, Lindelof submitted his rewritten screenplay to Fox. Scott had initially requested a $250 million budget and an adult oriented project, but Fox was reluctant to invest this amount of money, and wanted to ensure the film would receive a lower age-rating to broaden the potential audience.\n\nIn December 2010, it was reported that the film would be called \"Paradise\", named after John Milton's poem \"Paradise Lost\", but Scott considered that this would convey too much information about the film. Fox CEO Thomas Rothman suggested \"Prometheus\", which was confirmed as the title in January 2011. A release date was scheduled for , but weeks later the release was postponed until . With the name confirmed, the production team began to publicly distance the film from its \"Alien\" origins, and were deliberately vague about the connection between the films, believing it would build audience anticipation for \"Prometheus\". Scott stated that \"while \"Alien\" was indeed the jumping-off point for this project, out of the creative process evolved a new, grand mythology and universe in which this original story takes place. The keen fan will recognize strands of \"Alien\"s DNA, so to speak, but the ideas tackled in this film are unique, large and provocative.\" In June 2011, Scott and Lindelof confirmed that \"Prometheus\" takes place in the same universe as the events of the \"Alien\" series. In July 2011, Scott stated that \"by the end of the third act you start to realize there's a DNA of the very first \"Alien\", but none of the subsequent [films].\"\n\nSpaihts met Scott in late 2009 and they discussed Scott's desire to pursue an \"Alien\" prequel. Spaihts offered his concept, including a \"bridge\" that would connect the story of the film's human characters to the \"Alien\" saga. Spaihts was quickly hired, which he credited to the reception of his \"bridge\" idea. Spaihts claimed he created the concept spontaneously, without preconception. Spaihts wrote a 20-page \"extremely detailed outline\"; within three and a half weeks he had completed his first draft, and he submitted it to the producers on Christmas Day, 2009. Within 12 hours, Scott returned the script with notes for changes, and Spaihts spent the Christmas holiday redrafting.\n\nSpaihts was tasked with exploring unresolved mysteries from \"Alien\", such as the Space Jockey. He considered the mysteries of \"Alien\" to be alien in nature, and said, \"all the mysteries have alien players: the exoskeleton nightmare and ... the elephantine titan that was called the 'space jockey' ... How do you make anyone care about events between creatures like this?\" His solution was to link the alien mysteries to the past and future of humanity. He said: \"If that story is somehow ours and deeply enmeshed with the human story, that story changes meaning within our life, things of such significance that we think of our own lives differently.\" Spaihts found translating Scott's stylistic visual concepts to text difficult, and he periodically constrained some of Scott's ideas. He reminded Scott that in the scene they were discussing, the characters were subject to gravity and so could not simply float. By April 2010, the script was on the fourth draft. Scott said about the script, \"we are talking about gods and engineers. Engineers of space. And were the aliens designed as a form of biological warfare? Or biology that would go in and clean up a planet?\" In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and ready for filming.\n\nHowever, Scott instead contacted Lindelof and asked him to review Spaihts's script. Within the hour, a messenger delivered the script to Lindelof and informed him that he would wait outside to return it as soon as Lindelof had finished reading it. Lindelof was unaware of what Scott and the producers liked about the existing script, and informed them that he found the general concept appealing, but that the story relied too heavily on elements of the \"Alien\" films, such as the \"Alien\" creatures' life-cycle. As a direct prequel to \"Alien\", the story was shaped to lead into that film's story, and to recreate the familiar cues of that series, and Scott wanted to avoid repeating his previous accomplishments. Lindelof said, \"If the ending to [\"Prometheus\"] is just going to be the room that John Hurt walks into that's full of [alien] eggs [in \"Alien\"], there's nothing interesting in that, because we know where it's going to end. Good stories, you don't know where they're going to end.\" \"A true prequel should essentially precede the events of the original film, but be about something entirely different, feature different characters, have an entirely different theme, although it takes place in that same world.\"\nLindelof said that the other parts of the script were strong enough to survive without the \"Alien\" hallmarks, such as the \"Alien\" creature, which he believed had been diluted by the exposure it had received. He said, \"[The producers] were just looking for someone to say to them, Hey, we don't need the \"Alien\" stuff in here. It shouldn't be about that. It can be a part of this movie, but it shouldn't be what it's about.\" Lindelof said that the film could instead run parallel to the \"Alien\" series and that a sequel would be \"Prometheus 2\" and not \"Alien\", and submitted an idea for how such a sequel could work. Lindelof met with the producers the following morning, and was hired shortly afterward in late 2010. Under Lindelof, the script diverged from Spaihts's \"Alien\" prequel into an original creation. Scott and Lindelof worked together five days a week between July and August 2010 to construct the vision Scott wanted to convey and decide what script changes were needed, including scaling back the \"Alien\" symbolism and tropes. In August and September 2010, Lindelof spent almost five weeks writing his first draft, which he submitted in mid-September 2010. Inspired by \"Blade Runner\" and Spaihts's script, Lindelof thought that it would be possible to combine an \"Alien\" story of action and horror with \"the \"Blade Runner\" thematic,\" to ask bigger questions than he felt were normally posed in science fiction films. Lindelof said,\n\nScott's story concept was partially inspired by \"Chariots of the Gods?\", Erich von Däniken's work about the theory of ancient astronauts which hypothesizes that life on Earth was created by aliens. Scott said, \"NASA and the Vatican agree that [it is] almost mathematically impossible that we can be where we are today without there being a little help along the way ... That's what we're looking at [in the film], at some of Erich von Däniken's ideas of how did we humans come about.\" Spaihts originated the idea that David, the android, is like humans but does not want to be anything like them, eschewing a common theme in \"robotic storytelling\" such as \"Blade Runner\". He also developed the theme that while the human crew is searching for their creators, David is already among its creators. Scott liked these ideas and further explored them in Lindelof's rewrite. For Shaw, Lindelof felt it was important that she was distinct from \"Alien\"s Ripley, to avoid inevitable comparisons between the two characters. In Spaihts's draft, Shaw was directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants to seek out potentially dangerous knowledge. As with David, Lindelof expanded this facet of the character during his rewrites. He spent approximately eight months developing the script, finishing in March 2011 as filming began.\n\nPre-production began in April 2010. A team developed graphic designs for the film. Scott convinced Fox to invest millions of dollars to hire scientists and conceptual artists to develop a vision of the late 21st century. The production of \"Prometheus\" was marked by a high degree of secrecy and story details were kept \"extremely under-wraps.\" Ridley Scott was determined to maintain the secrecy of the plot, and he required the cast to sign clauses to prevent them disclosing story details, and the cast were allowed to read the script only under supervision in Scott's production office. One exception was made when a courier flew the script to one actor outside the US, and then stood guard while the actor read it. Scott said, \"I was insistent that the script not leak onto the internet, where it gets dissected out of context, which spoils it for everyone.\"\n\nIn July 2011, Lindelof said that the film would rely upon practical effects, and would use CGI generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals. Scott said that \"you can pretty much do anything you want\" with digital technology, and, \"Doug Trumbull once said to me 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even though we have remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper.\" Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski convinced Scott that it would be possible to film in 3D with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company 3ality Technica provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation. According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget. Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the \"Alien\" films was added in post-production using color grading processes, and the 3D equipment was based on post-\"Avatar\" technology.\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 21, 2011, lasted 82 days, and had an estimated $120–130 million budget. Filming began at Shepperton Studios and Pinewood Studios in England. Scott used eight sound stages for filming, including the 007 Stage. Studio space was limited and the crew had to make five stages work for approximately 16 sets, and increased the size of the 007 stage by over 30%.\n\nExterior shots of the alien world were shot in Iceland, where filming occurred for two weeks. It commenced on July 11, 2011, at the base of Hekla, an active volcano in southern Iceland. Speaking about working at the volcano, Scott said, \"If one is afraid of nature in this profession then it would be best to find a different job\". Filming also took place at Dettifoss, one of the most powerful waterfalls in Europe. The Iceland shoot involved 160 Icelandic crew members and over 200 imported crew. Scott said that the filming in Iceland comprised approximately fifteen minutes of footage for the film, and that the area represented the beginning of time. Morocco had been chosen as a location for these scenes, but the 2010 Arab Spring protests forced the change of venue. Alternatives including the Mojave Desert had been considered, but Scott explained that Iceland was ultimately chosen because \"here it is so rough and 'Jurassic-like' and that proved decisive\".\n\nIn September 2011, filming moved to the Ciudad de la Luz audiovisual complex in Alicante, Spain. Shooting areas included the complex's large water tank, and a nearby beach. The complex was booked from August 22, 2011, through to December 10, 2011, and set construction occurred from August until late September. Approximately 250 people worked on the three-month-long Spain shoot, generating over €1 million in the local economy. Filming also took place in the Wadi Rum valley in Jordan.\n\nScott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so the actors would know where they should be looking in any particular scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production. Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming. The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with Red Epic 3D cameras set on camera dollies and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a steadicam, which was used only occasionally.\n\nScott used the 3D footage to increase the illusion of depth. Despite this being his first 3D film he found the process easy. He said, \"You can literally twiddle a knob and the depth will increase\", and, \"the trick is not to overdo it\". In December 2011, Rapace undertook additional dialogue recordings for the film. Additional pick-up scenes were filmed during January 2012, including a one-day shoot on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, and a new scene shot at a cave in the Scottish mountains. For dark scenes, the film was color graded to specifically compensate for the light loss of 3D glasses, to ensure the image was comparable to the 2D version.\n\nIn July 2011, Scott said that he was filming \"Prometheus\" with both adult-oriented R and more accessible PG-13 film ratings in mind, allowing the more adult content to be cut if necessary without harming the overall presentation. Scott said he had a responsibility to 20th Century Fox to be able to present a PG-13 cut of the film if the studio demanded, allowing it to be viewed by a wider potential audience. When asked about the rating, Scott said, \"the question is, do you go for the PG-13, or do you go for what it should be, which is R? Financially it makes quite a difference ... essentially it's kinda R ... it's not just about blood, it's about ideas that are very stressful.\" Scott also said that, regardless of rating, he would present the most aggressive cut of the film he could, while Rothman said that Scott would not be forced to compromise the film's quality to avoid an R-rating. On May 7, 2012, Fox confirmed that the film had received an R-rating and would be released without any cuts being made. According to Scott, the scene of Shaw surgically removing her alien offspring was the significant cause of the restrictive rating, and it was suggested that removing the scene entirely would be the only way to gain a lower one. A fight scene between Shaw and the Engineer was shortened because Scott decided that Shaw directly wounding the Engineer diminished his role. Scott concluded work on the film in March 2012.\n\nMarc Streitenfeld, who had worked with Scott on earlier projects, composed the musical score for \"Prometheus\". It took just over a week to record with a 90-piece orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Streitenfeld began writing ideas for the score after reading the script before filming commenced. He used some unusual techniques to compose the score, and said, \"I actually wrote out the sheet music backwards so the orchestra played it backwards and then I digitally flipped it. So you're hearing the score as it's written, the same melody, but with a backwards sounding orchestra which gives it a kind of unusual, unsettling sound.\" The \"Prometheus (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\" album was released on iTunes on May 15, 2012, and on CD on June 4, 2012. It features 23 tracks by Streitenfeld and two supplemental tracks by Harry Gregson-Williams. Frédéric Chopins \"Raindrop prelude\" (1838) is also featured in the film.\n\nProduction designer Arthur Max led the film's design staff. His art team were tasked with deconstructing the art and visuals of \"Alien\", and reverse-designing them for the chronologically earlier setting of \"Prometheus\". Influence was drawn from the work of \"Alien\" creature designer H. R. Giger, and designers Ron Cobb and Chris Foss, including their designs for that film which Scott had been unable to develop at the time.\n\nFor the crew's space suits, Scott was inspired to include spherical glass helmets after reading a story in Steve Jobs' biography about building an office out of Gorilla Glass. Scott said, \"If I'm in 2083 and I'm going into space, why would I design a helmet that has blind spots. What I want is something where I have 360 [vision]. Glass, by then, will be light and you won't be able to break it with a bullet.\" The interior of the prop helmets had nine functioning video screens, internal lighting, an air supply provided by two fans, and battery packs concealed within a backpack. The helmet's exterior featured a functional light source and high definition video cameras with a transmitter and recorder. For the suit itself, Scott wanted to avoid the unwieldy NASA-style suit. His frequent collaborator, Janty Yates, used medical research concepts relating to skin replacement treatments and materials to develop a garment that would be believable, flexible and comfortable. The outfit comprised a neoprene suit worn under an outer space suit, a base to which the helmet could be attached, and a backpack.\n\nAboard the ship, Yates gave the characters their own distinct looks. Theron is dressed in an ice-silver, silk mohair suit. Yates said, \"[Theron] is the ice queen. It was always our vision to make her look as sculptural as possible\". Fassbender's David is dressed similarly to other crew members, but his outfit was given finer lines to produce a more linear appearance. To create a casual, relaxed appearance, Marshall-Green's Holloway was dressed in hoodies, fisherman pants, and flip-flops, while Elba wore a canvas-greased jacket to represent his long career at the helm of a ship.\n\nArthur Max designed the sets such as the alien world landscape and structures, and the vehicles, including the \"Prometheus\" and the Engineer's ship. Digital 3D models and miniature replicas of each set were built to allow the designers to envisage the connections between them and to know where the CGI elements would be inserted. To better blend the practical and the digital, the design team took rock samples from the Iceland location so they could match the graphical textures with the real rocks. To create the \"Prometheus\", Max researched NASA and European Space Agency spacecraft designs, and extended these concepts with his own ideas of how future space vehicles might look. He said that he wanted \"to do something that was state-of-the-art, which would represent a flagship spacecraft with every technology required to probe into the deepest corners of the galaxy.\"\n\nThe interior of the \"Prometheus\" was built across a two-level structure, fronted by a large, faceted, wrap around windscreen. Theron's quarters were designed to represent her high status in the crew, and were furnished with modern and futuristic items, including Swarovski chandeliers and a Fazioli piano. The ship's garage was built on the backlot of Pinewood Studios in England. The vehicles inside were built in 11 weeks and were designed to operate on difficult terrain while having a futuristic aesthetic. Max created a large pyramid structure for the alien world, which had its main interior areas connected by a series of chambers, corridors, and tunnels; it was so large that some members of the film crew became lost inside it. The pyramid was enhanced in post-production to further increase its size. One of the key sets, the chamber where the crew find the humanoid-head statue, was designed to resemble the interior of a cathedral and convey a quasi-religious impression. Giger designed the murals that appear within the chamber.\n\nFor the scene of the \"Prometheus\" descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art director Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor Richard Stammers and his team. Messing painted over these images and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes to have a sense of grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in \"Alien\". Much of LV-223s world was based upon the world visited in \"Alien\", but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain Olympus Mons and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work. MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien pyramid and a landing area for the \"Prometheus\", and resized the planet's natural features relative to the alien structures.\n\nNeal Scanlan and Conor O'Sullivan developed the film's alien creatures, aiming to convey that each creature has a logical biological function and purpose. Scanlan said that much of Scott's inspiration for creature design is drawn from natural life, such as plants and sea creatures. Creature designer Carlos Huante chose to make the creature designs pale to contrast the black-toned, Giger-influenced aesthetic of \"Alien\". Huante designed them to be white and embryonic because the events in the film occur before Giger's influence had taken effect. Huante took influences from references Scott was using to design the pale-skinned Engineers. Huante also referenced other Giger works, national monuments, large sculptures, and the Crazy Horse Memorial statue in South Dakota. Part of Huante's early design work included developing precursors to \"Alien\"s Facehugger, and a primitive \"Alien\" creature, but these were cut from the final release. When designing the Engineers, Scott and Huante referenced paintings by William Blake and J. M. W. Turner, and classical sculptures. Scott wanted the Engineers to resemble Greco-Roman gods, and instructed designer Neville Page to reference the Statue of Liberty, Michelangelo's \"David\", and Elvis Presley. The 8-foot tall, humanoid Engineers were created by applying bulky, full-body prosthetics to the actors, whose facial features were diminished by the material, and were later digitally enhanced to preserve the \"godlike\" physical perfection. Scott described the Engineers as tall, elegant \"dark angels\".\n\nThe snake-like alien dubbed the \"Hammerpede\" was given life through a mixture of CGI and practical effects, and the wires controlling the practical puppet were digitally removed. For a scene in which the Hammerpede is decapitated, the VFX team digitally animated and inserted the spontaneous growth of a replacement head. During the scene in which the Hammerpede erupts from Spall's character's corpse, Scott controlled the puppet using wires. Scott did not inform Dickie about what was to occur in the scene and her screaming reaction was real. The creature's design was partially inspired by translucent sea creatures with visible arteries, veins, and organs beneath the skin's surface, and cobras. The designers gave the creature a smooth, muscular, and powerful appearance. Early designs of the \"Trilobite\", the tentacled offspring cut from Shaw, resembled an octopus or squid. Page redeveloped this creature as an embryo in an early state of development, with tentacles that began fused together and would gradually split, creating new tentacles, as the creature developed. The practical creature was a remotely operated animatronic creation with a silicone skin.\n\nThe mutated Fifield effects were achieved mainly through the use of make-up and prosthetics. Due to concerns that the practical effects would be unsatisfactory, the filmmakers completed an alternative version of the sequence, in which Fifield was rendered as \"a digital character with elongated limbs and an engorged, translucent head, incorporating a semblance of Harris's face\". Three other variations of the mutated Fifield were modeled, but these were rejected as being too inhuman.\n\nFor its grown form, the \"Adult Trilobite\", Max found inspiration from an arthropod-like creature from Earth's Cambrian period, and the alien octopus in Jean Giraud's illustrations for the comic strip \"The Long Tomorrow\". Further inspiration came after Max found a formaldehyde-preserved giant squid, an image which met with Scott's approval. The film's last-unveiled creature, the \"Deacon\", was named by Scott for its long, pointed head that he considered resembled a bishop's mitre. Scanlan aimed to represent the creature's genetic lineage, beginning with Shaw and Holloway who produce the Trilobite which impregnates the Engineer, in its design. However, the creature was given a somewhat feminine appearance, since \"it was born of a female before being born of a male.\" Messing drew inspiration for the Deacon's birth scene from the birth of foals, and created an iridescent appearance for its skin, based on the equine placenta. The Deacon's protruding jaw was inspired by the goblin shark.\n\nSound effects were generated with a variety of sources including Pop Rocks—a brand of popping candy—and a parrot. The glistening ice forming on the stone cylinders discovered in the film was created by applying the popping candy to materials such as wet metal and stone that was then sprayed with water to produce the \"popping, cracking\" sound. Sound designer Ann Scibelli's parrot was recorded over several weeks to document her variety of vocalizations which were then used as beeps, alarms and the cries of Shaw's alien offspring.\n\n\"Prometheus\" contains approximately 1,300 digital effect shots. The main effects studio was Moving Picture Company (MPC), which produced 420 of the shots. Several other studios, including Weta Digital, Fuel VFX, Rising Sun Pictures, Luma Pictures, Lola Visual Effects, and Hammerhead Productions, also produced effects shots for the film.\n\nThe creation of life from the disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening scene was created by WETA Digital. The scene was difficult to produce because it had to convey the story of the Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited span of time. The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct to convey its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A light color scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used as an image reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from silicone and pumped black ink and oils into them while filming the changes occurring over an extended period of time.\n\nA key scene involving a large 3D hologram star map, dubbed the Orrery, was inspired by the 1766 Joseph Wright painting \"A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery\", in which a scientist displays a mechanical planetarium by candlelight. While discussing the necessity of a star map with Spaihts, Scott mentioned that he envisaged a physical representation being similar to the painting, although he was unaware of its title and described it as \"circles in circles with a candle lit image\". Using Scott's description, Spaihts located an image of the painting. Spaihts said, \"making the leap from a star map, to an Enlightenment painting, and then back into the far future. [Scott's] mind just multiplexes in that way\". The Orrery was one of the most complex visual effects, contained 80–100 million polygons, and took several weeks to render as a single, complete shot.\n\n\"Prometheus\" marketing campaign began on July 21, 2011 at the San Diego Comic-Con International, where images and footage from the film were presented by Lindelof and Theron; Scott and Rapace participated via satellite contribution. A segment of the footage showed Theron performing naked push-ups, which attracted much attention. A teaser poster was released on December 14, 2011, with the tagline, \"The search for our beginning could lead to our end.\" A bootleg recording of an incomplete trailer was leaked online on November 27, 2011, but was quickly taken down by Fox. The trailer was released on December 22, 2011.\n\nOn March 17, 2012, Scott, in partnership with AMC Theatres, hosted the premiere of the first full \"Prometheus\" trailer at the AMC Downtown Disney during WonderCon in Anaheim, California. The event was streamed live via Facebook, Twitter, and the AMC Theatre website, and the trailer was posted on AMC's YouTube channel immediately after its debut. Reactions to the trailer from WonderCon attendees, and on Twitter, were generally positive, and it received nearly three million views in the three days following its release. On April 10, 2012, media outlets were shown a 13-minute montage of scenes in 3D from the film's opening at the Vue Cinema in Leicester Square, London. The screening, and in particular the 3D visuals and the performances of Fassbender, Rapace, Theron, and Elba, was well received.\n\nOn April 29, 2012, the international launch trailer debuted in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 during the first advertisement break of the TV show \"Homeland\". Viewers were encouraged to share their opinions about the trailer on Twitter, some of which were then shared in a live broadcast during a later break. This was the first time that viewers' tweets were used in a broadcast advertisement. A competition, offering viewers a chance to win tickets to the film whenever the social platform Zeebox detected the advertisement airing, was launched on that site. On May 8, 2012, the advertisement became the subject of an investigation by the British broadcasting regulatory body Ofcom for allegedly breaching broadcast rules when a voiceover encouraged viewers to book tickets during the advertisement with the logo onscreen. The broadcast potentially broke a ruling that advertising and teleshopping must be clearly distinguishable from editorial content.\n\nAlthough marketers typically avoid promoting adult-oriented films to reach a broader demographic, the film attracted several promotional partners including Coors, Amazon, and Verizon FiOS, which were estimated to have spent $30 million in marketing support. Amazon directed interested users to purchase tickets through Fandango, and placed promotional material in products shipped to customers; this was the first time that Amazon had allowed such marketing by an external company. The premiere in London was streamed live via the film's website and the Verizon FiOS Facebook page. The event was facilitated by BumeBox, which took audience questions from social sites and gave them to reporters to ask at the event. The National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) released a series of \"Prometheus\" action figures in September 2012. A book, \"Prometheus: The Art of the Film\", containing production art and behind-the-scenes photographs, was released on June 12, 2012.\n\nA viral marketing campaign began on February 28, 2012, with the release of a video featuring a speech by Pearce, in character as Peter Weyland, about his vision for the future. Set in 2023, the \"TED 2023\" video presents a futuristic vision of a TED conference, an annual technology and design event held in Long Beach, California. The segment was conceived and designed by Scott and Lindelof, and directed by Scott's son, Luke. The production was made in collaboration with, and made available through TED because Lindelof wanted to introduce new audiences to the conference itself. Lindelof said that the scene takes place in a futuristic stadium because \"a guy like Peter Weyland—whose ego is just massive, and the ideas that he's advancing are nothing short of hubris—that he'd basically say to TED, 'If you want me to give a talk, I'm giving it in Wembley Stadium.\n\nTED community director Tom Rielly helped the film's producers gain approval for the use of the TED brand, which had not previously been used for promotional purposes. Rielly was involved in designing the 2023 conference, and said that the association generated millions of unique visits to the TED website. The video's release was accompanied by a fictional TED blog about the 2023 conference and a tie-in website for the fictional Weyland Corporation. On March 6, 2012, the Weyland website was updated to allow visitors to invest in the company as part of a game, which would reveal new \"Prometheus\" media.\n\nDuring the 2012 WonderCon, attendees at the film's panel were given Weyland Corporation business cards that directed them to a website and telephone number. After calling the number, the caller was sent a text message from Weyland Corporation that linked them to a video that was presented as an advertisement for the \"David 8\" android, narrated by Fassbender. An extended version of the video, released on April 17, 2012, lists the android's features, including its ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress. A full page \"David 8\" advertisement was placed in \"The Wall Street Journal\"; a Twitter account operated by a David8, that allowed Twitter users to ask the character questions, was included. A partnership with Verizon FiOS was launched, offering a virtual tour of the \"Prometheus\" spaceship. Another video, \"Quiet Eye\", starring Rapace as Shaw, was released on May 16, 2012, and debuted on the Verizon FIOS Facebook page. In a telephone call monitored by Yutani, a fictional company from the \"Alien\" series, Shaw requests Weyland's aid to seek out alien life. In France, the Saint-Martin ghost train station was converted to resemble alien architecture from the film, and was visible to passing commuters. The campaign continued after the film's release with a website that was listed during the film's end credits. The site referenced the philosophical novel \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" by Friedrich Nietzsche, and featured a video of Weyland, who quotes from the book. Another video followed in September 2012, featuring Elba's Captain Janek preparing for a mission.\n\nAt the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof said that the videos originated from the question of the film's status as an \"Alien\" prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the \"Alien\" films. He also said that the videos needed to be cool enough to justify their existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.\n\nThe premiere of \"Prometheus\" took place on May 31, 2012, at the Empire cinema in Leicester Square, London. The film was released in the United Kingdom on , 2012, and in North America on , 2012. It was simultaneously released in IMAX theaters and in 3D, and it is encoded for D-Box motion seats that provide physical feedback to the audience during the film.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, approximately £1 million ($1.6 million) of tickets were pre-sold. 18,827 tickets pre-sold for the London IMAX, the largest IMAX screen in the country, which broke the theater records for the highest grossing week of pre-sales with £293,312 ($474,687), and the highest grossing first day of pre-sales with £137,000 ($221,717). It extended this record to 30,000 tickets sold and £470,977 ($737,588) earned, and become the most pre-booked film at that theater, exceeding the performance of high-profile IMAX releases including \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\" and \"Avatar\".\n\nIn North America, audience tracking showed high interest among males, but low among females. In the week before the film's release, predictions were conflicted on whether \"Prometheus\" or \"\" (the first family-oriented film of the summer), which were released simultaneously, would reach number 1 for that weekend. On June 6, 2012, Fandango reported that with 42% of daily sales \"Prometheus\" was beating \"Madagascar 3\". The online tracking for \"Prometheus\" surged with each additional promotional footage. \"Prometheus\" was predicted to earn approximately $30 million, and \"Madagascar 3\" around $45 million. As the weekend approached, tracking suggested a $55 million debut for \"Madagascar 3\" and $50–$55 million for \"Prometheus\". \"Prometheus\" was disadvantaged by \"Madagascar\" opening in 264 more theaters and its adult rating.\n\n\"Prometheus\" was considered a financial success overall. After a strong start in North America, the film failed to meet the studio's expectations, but it continued to perform strongly in other territories until the end of its theatrical run. \"Prometheus\" earned $126.4 million (31.4%) in North America and $276.9 million (68.6%) elsewhere for a worldwide total of $403.4 million, making it the 18th highest-grossing film of 2012, and at its peak it was the 155th highest-grossing film worldwide unadjusted for inflation.\n\"Prometheus\" was released in 15 markets between May 30 and June 1, 2012—about a week before its North American release. The earlier start in these countries was timed to avoid competition with the start of the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship the following week. On its opening day, which varies depending on the country, it earned $3.39 million in the United Kingdom, $2.2 million in Russia, and $1.5 million in France. The film earned $34.8 million during its opening weekend from 4,695 theaters in 15 markets, and debuted at number 1 in 14 of them, with an average of $7,461 per theater. Its overall rank for the weekend was third behind \"Men in Black 3\" and \"Snow White & the Huntsman\". Its opening weekends in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($10.1 million), Russia and the CIS ($9.80 million), and France and the Maghreb region ($6.68 million) represented its largest takings. By June 8, the film had opened in a total of 50 markets, and was also successful during its opening weekends in Australia ($7.2 million) and South Korea ($4.2 million). During its late August opening in Japan, the film earned $9.6 million.\nIn North America, \"Prometheus\" earned $3.561 million in midnight showings at 1,368 theaters, including $1.03 million from 294 IMAX theaters, and went on to earn $21.4 million through its opening day. During its opening weekend, the film earned $51.05 million from 3,396 theaters—an average of $15,032 per theater—ranking second behind \"Madagascar 3\" ($60.4 million), which made it the second largest opening for a film directed by Scott behind his 2001 thriller \"Hannibal\", the third largest second-place opening, the ninth largest opening for a prequel, and the tenth largest for an R-rated film. The largest demographic of the opening weekend audience was over the age of 25 (64%) and male (57%). 3D showings accounted for 54% of ticket sales, while IMAX contributed 18%—the majority of which was accounted for in the 3D figure. The film closed on September 20, 2012 after 105 days (15 weeks) in release with a total gross of $126.4 million. The figure made it the number 43 highest-grossing film to never finish a week as the number 1 film.\n\nThe film garnered a 73% approval rating from 288 critics—an average rating of 7/10 on the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which said, \"Ridley Scott's ambitious quasi-prequel to \"Alien\" may not answer all of its big questions, but it's redeemed by its haunting visual grandeur and compelling performances—particularly Michael Fassbender as a fastidious android.\" Metacritic provides a score of 65 out of 100 from 42 critics, which indicates \"generally favorable\" reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a \"B\" on a scale of A+ to F, while audience members under 25 rated it the highest at A-. Reviews frequently praised both the film's visual aesthetic and design, and Fassbender's performance as the android David received almost universal acclaim. However the plot drew a mixed response from critics, who criticized plot elements that remained unresolved or were predictable, tempered by appreciation for the action and horror set-pieces.\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\"s Todd McCarthy called the film's visuals vivid, stunning, and magnificent on a technical level, and praised the performances of Fassbender, Rapace, and Theron, but wrote that the film \"caters too much to imagined audience expectations when a little more adventurous thought might have taken it to some excitingly unsuspected destinations.\" \"Time Out London\"s Tom Huddleston wrote that \"the photography is pleasingly crisp and the design is stunning\", but that, \"[t]he script feels flat ... the dialogue is lazy, while the plot, though crammed with striking concepts, simply fails to coalesce. After an enjoyable setup, the central act is baggy, confusing and, in places, slightly boring, while the climax has flash and fireworks but no real momentum.\" Emanuel Levy wrote that the writing was his only complaint about the film, which, he said, \"is not only uneven, but promises more original ideas and thematic provocations than it can possibly deliver.\" Roger Ebert gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, labeling it a \"seamless blend of story, special effects and pitch-perfect casting, filmed in sane, effective 3-D that doesn't distract.\" Ebert wrote that Rapace's performance \"continues here the tradition of awesome feminine strength begun by Sigourney Weaver in \"Alien\"\", but considered that Elba's Janek has the most interesting character evolution. Ebert thought that the plot raises questions and does not answer them, which made the film intriguing and parallel to the \"classic tradition of golden age sci-fi\". He later went on to name it as one of the best films of 2012.\n\n\"Total Film\"s Jonathan Crocker wrote that the plot successfully integrated itself with \"Alien\"s mythology while offering its own original ideas. \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Lisa Schwarzbaum was positive towards the cast, particularly Rapace, and the cinematography. \"Salon\"s Andrew O'Hehir wrote that the film was \"somber, spectacular and ponderous\", but that the \"portentousness and grandiosity ... is at once the film's great strength and great weakness\" and criticized the characters for lacking common sense. O'Hehir also mentioned Wolski's cinematography and Max's production design. \"The New York Times\"' A. O. Scott criticized the story as weak, and argued that the narrative's twists and reversals undermine its \"lofty, mindblowing potential\". He said the film has no revelations, just \"bits of momentarily surprising information bereft of meaning or resonance\", and that Rapace is a \"fine heroine, vulnerable and determined\".\n\n\"Variety\" film critic Justin Chang wrote that the film's narrative structure was unable to handle the philosophical dimension of the plot, and that \"Prometheus\" was lazily deferring key plot points under the presumption that a sequel would be made. \"The Guardian's\" Peter Bradshaw wrote that \"Prometheus\" was \"more grandiose, more elaborate—but less interesting\" than \"Alien\", and lacked the latter's \"central killer punch\". Ian Nathan of \"Empire\" magazine was unimpressed by Rapace—whom he described as an unconvincing lead—and said that with \"a lack of suspense, threadbare characters, and a very poor script, the stunning visuals, gloopy madness, and sterling Fassbenderiness can't prevent \"Prometheus\" feeling like \"Alien\"s poor relation.\" \"The Village Voice\"s Nick Pinkerton wrote that the film is \"prone to shallow ponderousness\", and that Scott \"can still mimic the appearance of an epic, noble, important movie—but the appearance is all.\" He criticized Rapace and Marshall-Green for failing to instill interest in their characters' relationship, but added: \"there are a few set pieces here that will find a place of honor among aficionados of body horror and all things clammy and viscous\".\n\nJames Cameron said: \"I enjoyed \"Prometheus\". I thought it was great. I thought it was Ridley returning to science fiction with gusto, with great tactical performance, beautiful photography, great native 3D. There might have been a few things that I would have done differently, but that's not the point—you could say that about any movie.\"\n\nIn North America, \"Prometheus\" DVD and Blu-ray disc releases were listed for pre-order in partnership with Amazon on June 1, 2012, a week before the film was released in theaters. A limited number of cinema tickets for the film were offered as a pre-order incentive. In June 2012, \"FX\" obtained the rights to the film's network television premiere. On September 7, 2012, Fox announced that \"Prometheus\" would be the launch title of its new digital distribution initiative \"Digital HD\". The film was released on September 18, 2012, three weeks prior to its DVD, Blu-ray disc and Video on demand (VOD) release, for downloading and streaming through platforms including Amazon, iTunes, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live in over 50 countries. The film was released on Blu-ray disc and DVD on October 9, 2012. The Blu-ray disc edition of the film was released in a 2-disc set and a 4-disc \"Collector's Edition\". Both versions contain the theatrical cut of \"Prometheus\", commentary by Scott, Lindelof and Spaihts, a DVD and digital copy of the film, alternate and deleted scenes, and other features. Additionally, the Collector's Edition contains the 3D version of the film and approximately 7 hours of supplemental features including a documentary on the film's production. On October 8, 2012, it was reported that Fox had requested an extended version of the film for home media, but Scott refused to edit cut scenes back into the theatrical version of the film, which he considered his director's cut. During its first week of sale in the United Kingdom, \"Prometheus\" was the number 1 selling film on DVD and Blu-ray Disc, outselling its nearest competitor by a factor of three. An Ultra HD Blu-ray version is scheduled for release in September 2017.\n\nScott discussed a continuation of the series in March 2012, saying that \"Prometheus\" leaves many questions unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel. In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved so that they could be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that \"Prometheus\" could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. By August 2012, a sequel was announced to be in development for release no earlier than 2014. Lindelof chose not to work on the new film, citing other commitments. Titled \"\", the sequel premiered in London, England on May 4, 2017, and was released in the United States on May 19, 2017. Set eleven years after the events of \"Prometheus\", \"Alien: Covenant\"s story follows the crew of the Covenant space ship who land on an uncharted and seemingly uninhabited planet. The film stars Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Demian Bichir, Jussie Smollett, Amy Seimetz, Carmen Ejogo, Callie Hernandez, Alex England and Billy Crudup. On release, \"Alien: Covenant\" earned a worldwide box office gross of $240.7 million (compared to \"Prometheus\" $403.4 million), and received generally favorable reviews. A sequel to \"Alien: Covenant\" is in development.\n\nIn 2013, a comic book series was announced by Dark Horse Comics that serves as a spin-off to \"Prometheus\". The series, titled \"Fire and Stone\", is an \"Alien vs. Predator\" crossover featuring content exclusive to \"Prometheus\". The first issue of \"Fire and Stone\" was released on September 10, 2014.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14294258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14294258", "title": "Robert Chester (poet)", "text": "Robert Chester (poet)\n\nRobert Chester (flourished 1601) is the mysterious author of the poem \"Love's Martyr\" which was published in 1601 as the main poem in a collection which also included much shorter poems by William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, George Chapman and John Marston, along with the anonymous \"Vatum Chorus\" and \"Ignoto\".\n\nDespite attempts to identify Chester no information has ever emerged to indicate with any certainty who he was. Currently all that is known of Chester is his name, the long poem he published, and a few unpublished verses. The poem's meaning is deeply obscure. Even the authenticity of the date on the title page has been questioned. It is also not known why Shakespeare and so many other distinguished poets supplemented the publication of such an obscure person with their own works.\n\nThe only clue to Chester's identity is the fact that his poem was dedicated to Sir John Salusbury of Lleweni Hall, Denbighshire, in Wales. Sir John was a member of the powerful Salusbury family of Wales. It may have been published to celebrate his knighthood in June 1601. However, even this date has been questioned.\n\nIn 1878 Chester was identified with a man of that name from Royston, Cambridgeshire, by Alexander Grosart, who produced the first modern edition of the poem. However, in 1913, Carleton Brown argued that Chester must have been closely associated with Salusbury in Denbighshire. Also, Chester's verse suggests that he was a servant of Salusbury's, rather than a social equal as was the Robert Chester from Royston. Brown discovered a manuscript poem entitled \"A Winter's Garland\", written by Chester, in the Salisbury family archives. Another poem, welcoming Salusbury home from London, compares Chester's own crude \"hoarse-throat raven's song\" to the \"court beautifying poets\" he would have heard in London. Brown concluded that Chester was a local employee of Salusbury's who probably worked in his household. In 2009, Boris Borukhov, comparing the signatures of the poet and the Robert Chester from Royston, demonstrated that they were two different people. Chester's description of himself as a \"British\" poet, rather than \"English\" one, his particular interest in Geoffrey of Monmouth's account of King Arthur, as well as his links to Salusbury, strongly suggest that he was Welsh.\n\nHowever, no documentation beyond this has been found to identify Chester. E. A. J. Honigmann argues that Chester was probably Salusbury's local chaplain or secretary, and that he and his patron shared a taste for \"mystical verse\" which contained obscure acrostic puzzles. Salusbury himself was a poet. A previous collection of verse, \"Sinetes Passions\" (1597) by Robert Parry had included a supplement containing acrostic verse, possibly written by Salusbury.\n\nThe full title of Chester's book explains the content:\n\nThe Italian poet \"Torquato Caeliano\" is as mysterious as Robert Chester himself. No original Italian work from which the poem is supposed to have been translated has ever been identified, nor is Caeliano a known Italian poet. It has been argued that Chester made up Caeliano to conceal the personal significance of the poem's allegory. The name is probably a combination of the names of the real poets Torquato Tasso and Livio Celiano.\n\nAnother mystery is the alternative title \"Rosalins Complaint\", since there is no reference to anyone called \"Rosalin\" in the poem. The name may be derived from Edmund Spenser's \"The Shepherd's Calendar\". Possibly this too had a private meaning that would have been understood by Chester and his circle.\n\nThe \"turtle\" in the title is the turtledove, not the shelled reptile.\n\nThe poem was published by Edward Blount and printed by Richard Field. It was not entered in the Stationers' Register. Only three copies of the original edition are known to have survived, though two are partial texts. Another copy appears to be from the same edition but has a different title page. This announces the poem as \"The Anuals of the great Brittaine\", going on to describe it as an \"excellent Monument wherein may be seene all the antiquities of this Kingdom to the satisfaction of both Universities, or any other place stirred with Emulation of long continuance. Excellently figured out in a worthy poem\". This page is dated 1611, and said to be published by Matthew Lownes.\n\nChester prefaced his poem with a short dedication addressed to the Phoenix and Turtledove, traditional emblems of perfection and devoted love, respectively:\n\nThe poem is a long allegory, incorporating the story of King Arthur, in which the relationship between the birds is explored, and its symbolism articulated.\n\nIt begins with the personification of Nature observing that the magnificently beautiful Phoenix is apparently about to die without an heir. The physical description given of the Phoenix is as a human female rather than a bird. Nature visits the Classical gods and pleads with Jupiter to find a way to give the Phoenix a child. Jupiter says that she must bring the Phoenix to the \"isle of Paphos\" to meet the Turtledove whose lover has apparently died. The Turtledove is guarding the fire of Prometheus. Jupiter gives Nature a magical \"balm\" to anoint the Tutledove, which will make him fall in love with the Phoenix. On the trip she tells the story of King Arthur, gives an account of ancient British kings and gives Brythonic (Welsh) etymologies for British towns. There follows a long description of the flora and fauna of Paphos, explaining the nature and uses of the various plants and animals.\n\nAt the island, the Phoenix and the Turtledove fall in love, apparently without the aid of the balm. But first the Turtledove asks the Phoenix to forgive him for some unspecified wrong. They then agree to die together in a self-sacrificing fire, building an altar to Apollo, the patron of poetry. As they are consumed, the Phoenix laments the death of the Turtledove. A watching pelican observes the Phoenix's own death and describes a new and even more beautiful Phoenix emerging in glory from the flames.\n\nThe narrative is followed by a series of acrostic love poems entitled \"Cantos to the fair Phoenix made by Paphian Dove\". Each line of the verses begins with each letter of the alphabet in sequence. These are supposed to have been written by the Turtledove to the Phoenix, implying a long and complex relationship. They are followed by other separate love poems idealising spiritual devotion to the Phoenix. It is not clear whether these poems are written by Chester, who signed his name to the end of the narrative section. William Empson stated that they displayed the \"very recognisable facility and ingenuity\" of Sir John Salusbury's poetry, published in Parry's 1597 book.\n\nAfter these are the poems by Shakespeare and the others, which comment on the symbolism. In addition to the named poets, there are poems attributed to \"Vatum Chorus\" (chorus of poets) and \"Ignoto\" (anonymous). The poems are introduced by Vatum Chorus and Ignoto, followed by Shakespeare's \"The Phoenix and the Turtle\", which states that the birds died \"leaving no posterity\" due to their \"married chastity\". John Marston then seems to reply to Shakespeare's \"moving epicedium\", by referring to the couple's \"glorious issue\": the new Phoenix born from the flames. Chapman adds more detail on the relationship, saying that the Phoenix provided every variety of life to the Turtle, \"She was to him the Analysed World of pleasure, / Her firmness cloth'd him in variety\". Jonson ends with an idealisation of the Phoenix, whose judgement shines as \"Clear as a naked Vestal, / Closed in an orb of Crystal.\"\n\nThere have been many attempts to interpret the symbolism of the poem, though the most common one is that the Phoenix represents Queen Elizabeth I, who used the Phoenix as her symbol. The \"isle of Paphos\" is thus her realm of England, the history of which is given in such detail. The Turtledove has been said to be the dedicatee of the poem, Sir John Salusbury. Critics Katherine Duncan-Jones and Henry Woudhuysen argue that the recent Essex Rebellion against the queen is referred to in several passages, and state that Salusbury stands for the loyalty of the people as a whole. The fact that Salusbury's cousin sided with the rebels may be linked to the contrition that the Turtledove has to show. The \"glorious issue\" would thus be the prosperity and stability of the kingdom, to be passed on to Elizabeth's heir, James VI of Scotland. However, the degree of intimacy between the lovers, albeit chaste, has been used to argue against this view, as has the fact that both the Phoenix and Turtle die, though Salusbury and the Queen were still very much alive in 1601.\n\nAnother view, first expressed by Carleton Brown, is that the poem celebrated the marriage of Salusbury and his wife Ursula Stanley, the illegitimate daughter of Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby. Brown argued that it was written after the birth of their first child. This view has been criticised on the grounds that the poem emphasises the chastity of the couple, nor is it clear why Ursula and John would have to die to produce a child. Indeed they were both alive in 1601, having by then had nine more children since their first daughter.\n\nOther commentators have suggested esoteric symbolism, or politically dangerous messages, hidden in deliberately obscure allegory, such as support for Catholic martyrs such as Anne Line, or for Essex himself.\n\n"}

{"id": "1905914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1905914", "title": "The Informers", "text": "The Informers\n\nThe Informers is a collection of short stories, seemingly linked by the same continuity, authored by American author Bret Easton Ellis. It was first published as a whole in 1994. Chapters 6 and 7, \"Water from the Sun\" and \"Discovering Japan\", were published separately in the UK by Picador in 2007. It displays attributes similar to Ellis' novels \"Less Than Zero\", \"The Rules of Attraction,\" and, to a lesser extent, \"American Psycho\". Like many of Ellis' novels, the stories here are set predominantly in California.\n\nNameless protagonist receives a phone call from Bruce, who apologizes for not being in New Hampshire, but in Los Angeles. It has been two months since the last time he contacted her. Bruce mentions how things have deteriorated ever since sleeping with Lauren, the girlfriend of his wealthy roommate, Robert. The affair between the two lasted a week before she moved on to someone wealthier than Robert. Bruce then had an affair with Lauren's brother, Marshall, which lasted longer than his affair with Lauren only because Marshall stayed in the apartment for a week and a half before moving back in with his ex-boyfriend. Bruce ends up moving out of Robert's apartment and into Reynold's due to some of Robert's expensive pet lizards dying, but this is a feeble excuse.\n\nShe thinks back to the past summer, when she met Bruce at a workshop, but has few memories of the time spent together. Bruce inquires about an event during that summer that she cannot remember. After the phone call, she meets up with Reynolds for dinner at a Chinese restaurant. Although Reynolds makes conversation, all the protagonist can think about is Bruce, Lauren and Arizona.\n\nThis chapter is narrated by Tim. This may possibly be Tim Price from the novel \"American Psycho\", because as mentioned in \"American Psycho\" Tim is from California, where he went to school at UCLA before dropping out and going to Stanford.\n\nTim and his friends Raymond, Dirk, and Graham gather at Mario's restaurant, where Raymond recalls that it is the one-year-anniversary of the death of Jamie, a mutual acquaintance of the boys'. Emotions run high as Dirk denies remembering that it is the anniversary, ultimately breaking down and recalling Jamie's death in graphic detail: Dirk was following Jamie's car through the desert when Jamie crashed it, and Dirk pulled Jamie's body from the wreck and waited with it until help arrived.\n\nRaymond becomes upset by the story and retreats to the bathroom to cry, where Tim goes to calm him down. Although Tim acknowledges to the reader that Jamie never liked Raymond, Tim tells him that Jamie considered him a good friend, which cheers Raymond up. Meanwhile, Tim notices inconsistencies in Dirk's story: Although the coroner's report stated that Jamie died instantly when his car crashed, Dirk claims to have watched helplessly as Jamie slowly bled to death. Dirk dismisses the inconsistency as his intentionally trying to upset Raymond for bringing up the accident.\n\nThis chapter is narrated by the ex-wife of William, and mother of Graham and Susan. Though unnamed in the novel, she is called \"Laura\" in the film adaptation. The chapter starts out with a dream about the narrator being pushed out the window by her much younger lover Martin. She then awakens and wanders about the house in a daze of Valium. She tries to make conversation with her son and daughter, but fails as they either ignore her, or change the subject. She then eats lunch with Martin, then goes back to his apartment and has sex with him, after which she gives him a pith helmet as a gift.\n\nThe next scene is the narrator sitting by the pool observing the pool cleaner. The pool cleaner then finds two dead rats and starts talking to the narrator, who becomes flustered by the conversation. The narrator then has lunch with her friends, in which she daydreams about the pool boy. After this she talks with her daughter Susan who mentions Blair. This may be the same Blair from \"Less Than Zero\" as she would be about the right age and living in LA. The narrator then dreams of drowning rats and pool boys, then wakes up and has more Valium before calling Martin.\n\nThe narrator then has lunch with her son and daughter. During this lunch Graham and Susan mention Julian. This again is probably the same Julian from \"Less Than Zero\"; as he would be about the right age, deals heroin, and is mentioned to be a male prostitute. The next section is where the narrator gets a call from her mother. They discuss her mother's health and the narrator remembers a Christmas from her childhood.\n\nNext the narrator meets with her psychiatrist so she can get her prescriptions filled. She then follows her son Graham and watches him score drugs. She then talks with Martin about how she is friend with his mother, then loans him money to pay for Billy Idol tickets. After this her husband William and she are getting ready to go to a party. She contemplates filling William's insulin shot with air to kill him, because they just had a fight. Once at the party she mentions seeing the rock star's wife who tried to kill herself. This is most likely Bryan Metro's wife who also tries to kill herself and is discussed in the chapter Discovering Japan.\n\nThis chapter is narrated by Les Price, the father of Tim Price from previous chapters. The chapter begins with Les on the phone with a man who is referred to by what sounds like a surname, Lynch. Les is watching Tim and Graham stand in line for a movie through the mirrored window in his office. While he watches the two boys, he begins to see signs that the two boys he thinks are friends, may have a more physical relationship. Les gets a phone call from his ex-wife Elena, who informs him that Tim does not want to go to on the trip to Mauna Kea. The next day, Les picks up Tim in his limousine and, after Les makes some attempts to talk to him and fails, they go to the airport.\n\nAfter Tim and his father arrive in Hawaii, they eat at the Mauna Kea restaurant and his father once again tries unsuccessfully to make conversation with Tim. Once dinner ends, they go walking around the hotel until they meet two ladies from Chicago at the bar. Les tries unsuccessfully to pick up on the two ladies, and Tim gets upset at his father's actions and leaves. They play tennis and Les wins every set, which Tim shrugs off. They go to the beach and relax in the sun, until Tim meets a girl his age, named Rachel. Later that evening, Tim and his father have dinner with Rachel. Les tries to pick up Rachel during the dinner, at which point Tim freaks out and leaves. Tim's dad finds him up in their room smoking marijuana, causing him to attempt in vain to apologize. Les has been crying, possibly motivated by guilt. Les wanders around the hotel and once again meets Rachel. Les talks with her about manta rays and Tim. The chapter ends with Tim and Les sitting on the beach staring at the ocean.\n\nThe chapter involves Susan, the sister of Graham and daughter of William, going to Los Angeles by train to her father's wedding. She remembers the conversation she has with her father asking if she approved of his marriage to Cheryl. The father also admits never telling the mother of the marriage and that a divorce has never been finalized. Since the father hardly ever talks about Cheryl in detail the girl gets most of her information from Graham. She also mentions that one summer she had spent time with Cheryl.\n\nShe tells her father—or rather lets him assume—that she likes Cheryl; but in a phone conversation with Graham later on in the chapter, she describes how she believes it is a bad idea for them to get married and how much she disapproves of it. Later in the story, the narrator calls her mother and discovers that she had not heard about the wedding. At the end of the chapter, she leaves Los Angeles giving the reader the impression that she travelled there but then decided not to stay, instead planning to return by train to Camden College. The character of Susan had previously made an appearance in \"The Rules of Attraction\", sleeping with Sean Bateman.\n\nChapter about Cheryl Laine, a news anchor with a complicated love life. She married William, but they separated after he left her for a woman named \"Linda\". The chronology of all this is unclear, as are Cheryl's age and Linda's current significance (or lack thereof) in William's life. It is clear that Cheryl views William as an ex, however. Due to her high-profile career, Cheryl is recognized in public places. Like William's (other) ex-wife (Graham's mother), Cheryl has now started sleeping with much younger men who are using her for food and shelter.\n\nShe must remind her boyfriend Danny to record her newscasts, as she feels they are the only opportunity for him to look at her nowadays. Danny informs her that Ricky, the boyfriend of Danny's pal, Biff, has been murdered. Neither Cheryl nor Danny truly seem to care, though Danny claims he does. Throughout the story, William tries to reconcile his marriage with Cheryl, pleading that he's changed. She tells him, however, that she's happier with Danny despite her own fears he may be more attracted to Biff than to her. Danny, in turn, abruptly dumps her by a note left in her apartment, and suggests she hook up with Biff.\n\nBurned out rock star Bryan Metro—the father of a friend of Martin's and the ex-husband of a woman Graham's mother is friends with—travels to Japan on his world tour, where he beats up groupies, rapes hotel maids, has sex with underage girls, and engages in drug-induced acts of self-mutilation. In a constant, drug-and-alcohol induced stupor, he attempts to negotiate the future of his career with his savvy, world-weary agent, who wants Bryan to team up with an up-and-coming band known as the English Prices. Bryan proves resistant, and is too focused on his own self-indulgence to care. Lost in the past, Bryan makes unsuccessful attempts to reconcile via phone with his ex-wife and son, and meditates on the suicide of one of his former bandmates, an event left out of a well-received documentary film about the events leading to the band's dissolution. Bryan ultimately completes the tour after a disastrous show (during which he forgets the words to his own songs) and prepares to head back to America.\n\nThis section is a series of letters from a character named Anne, who is a 20-year-old student at Camden College taking a semester (or more) off in Los Angeles with her grandparents, to Sean (character Sean Bateman from \"The Rules of Attraction\"). The letters span from September to January and decrease in frequency. Anne undergoes drastic physical, emotional, and mental changes, being indoctrinated into the often detached and morally hollow Los Angeles mindset. Among other things, Anne specifically details her friendship with 30-year-old named Randy. She practically lives at his house much of the time and describes him as a sort of best friend, constantly writing about him in the letters. Yet she seems pretty unaffected when he is found dead (possibly murdered) and mentions it in passing as a minor detail. Physically she changes from a brunette, pale, scholarly and sensitive college student to blonde, tan, vapid and disillusioned aerobics junkie.\n\nGraham lives in an apartment with his girlfriend, Christie, and two other boys, Randy and Martin, the latter of whom is having an affair with Graham's mother and with whom Graham is also having sex. Graham is further convinced that Christie and Martin are having sex, but does not care.\n\nGraham visits Martin at a building where Martin is filming a music video for the English Prices, whose stoned lead singer proves difficult to work with. Later he has lunch with Christie, who tells him that a friend of theirs has been found dead in Mexico, severely mutilated and drained of blood. The two argue about their relationship, ultimately concluding that neither cares if the other has sex with different people.\n\nOne morning Graham goes downstairs to discover that a hostage situation is unfolding across the street involving numerous police officers; Graham dismissively watches it unfold along with the doorman, who wants to be introduced to Martin so that he can get into music videos. Graham ultimately goes back upstairs, ignoring the outcome of the hostage situation. Later, he receives word that his father has been killed in a plane crash, and travels out to Las Vegas to see the body and visit the accident site. Afterwards he gambles most of his money away at different Casinos, and ultimately loses most of his father's ashes after betting them on a game of Blackjack.\n\nChapter 10 flashes back to the life of Jamie, whose death was recounted earlier. Jamie is a sexist, racist young playboy fond of making jokes about Ethiopians. Throughout the course of the story, it becomes clear that Jamie either is, or at least believes himself to be, a vampire, who sleeps in a coffin outfitted with cable television and survives on raw filet mignon and by drinking the blood of teenage girls during sex. He is part of an apparent secret society of other \"vampires,\" including socialite Miranda and his friend, Dirk, who has taken vampirism to the extreme by killing his victims rather than simply draining and drinking their blood.\n\nVisiting Dirk, Jamie discovers various mutilated body parts that indicate him as the serial killer responsible for deaths mentioned in several previous stories. Jamie and Dirk uncomfortably recall the fate of Roderick, who disappeared at the same time a pile of ashes were found at the bottom of his pool, near a wooden stake and Lawry's garlic powder. The next time Jamie picks up a girl he discovers that she is more perceptive to his racism and lifestyle than his other conquests, which causes him to snap and murder her.\n\nIn the last section, Jamie goes to visit his psychiatrist, Dr. Nova, whom he asks for more Darvocet. Jamie taunts the psychiatrist by claiming responsibility for his father's death; Dr. Nova calmly dismisses the story as one Jamie has told before, casting doubt on Jamie's reliability as a narrator. Jamie then threatens to kill Dr. Nova's daughter, spurring him to write the prescription. Before leaving, Jamie claims to be the biblical demon Legion.\n\nA car wash attendant, Tommy, gets a call from an old acquaintance of his, Peter, who wants to stay at his place while he visits the city. Tommy agrees, and Peter shows up later along with his girlfriend, a heroin addict named Mary who takes to sleeping on a mattress on the floor of Tommy's room. Initially, Peter and Mary only prove to be a minor nuisance, as the morbidly obese Peter binge-eats all day and watches cartoons while Mary shoots up in the bedroom. One afternoon, however, Tommy comes home to discover a ten-year-old boy tied up in the bathtub; Peter explains that he owes money to a drug dealer named Spin, and explains that the child—whom he and Mary kidnapped from the mall—is part of a plan to raise money to pay off the debt. Tommy initially protests, prompting Peter to assault him. Tommy quickly grows too apathetic to intervene, and simply takes to urinating in his kitchen sink and defecating at a nearby gas station as a way to avoid the bathroom.\n\nAs time goes on it becomes apparent that Peter has no real plan to use the child as a means of income; he never makes ransom demands from the child's parents, and only briefly considers selling him to the vampires in Los Angeles, before deciding to use the boy as his own personal sex slave. The sight of the child's bloody body after being raped by Peter only causes Tommy to become more apathetic.\n\nOne night, left alone with Mary, Tommy attempts to have sex with her. Mary tells him that the last time the couple found themselves in a similar situation, she had sex with their host, prompting Peter to shoot him in the eye and castrate him. Nevertheless, Tommy still attempts to have sex with her, an effort that fails when she passes out from heroin.\n\nAfter Spin shows up and threatens Tommy, Peter decides to flee to Las Vegas, and asks Tommy to come along with. Before they leave, he encourages Tommy to murder the child to tie up loose ends. Tommy initially refuses, but is too apathetic to keep up his protest, and obligingly stabs the boy to death. The trio flee into the desert, where Peter reminds Tommy that the child's death is on his hands, and not Peter's. When Tommy brings up the man that Peter shot and castrated, Peter is genuinely confused, and indicates he does not know what Tommy is talking about.\n\nAn unnamed protagonist spends his days with his dying girlfriend, who wants to spend the time she has left on the beach at her mother's house in Malibu. The protagonist meditates upon his girlfriend's rapidly deteriorating condition, which she first exhibited at their senior prom, and which he attended while high.\n\nKeeping the couple company are the girlfriend's best friend, Mona, and a seemingly endless string of young men that Mona brings home. The latest, Griffin, clashes with the narrator by drinking all of his beer, exacerbating the already tense situation. After sleeping with Mona, the narrator informs her of his ambivalence towards his girlfriend, and his decision to leave the next day: Her impending death reminds him too much of his own mortality, and the prospect of being around to witness it is too frightening.\n\nThe narrator visits his girlfriend one last time as she lays weakly on the beach, watching the sunset, listlessly begging to be allowed to work on her tan. The narrator quietly walks away, leaving her alone and contemplating his own mortality.\n\nAn unnamed protagonist spends the day at the zoo with her married lover, Bruce, a television writer who has been using her for money and sex while promising to leave his wife. Over the course of the day, the narrator finds parallels between the various injured zoo animals they encounter and her own life situation, as her attempts to leave Bruce all end with Bruce begging her not to and the narrator ultimately relenting.\n\nWhen the narrator finally tries to confront Bruce about leaving his wife, Bruce tells her a long, convoluted story about being an alien sent to Earth to prepare for its destruction in the 24th century. Leaving the zoo, the narrator contemplates finally living a life independent of Bruce, but sees no immediate release from the situation.\n\nA film version of the book has been produced from a script by Ellis and Nicholas Jarecki and was screened at the 2009 Sundance film festival. It was directed by Gregor Jordan and featured an ensemble cast, such as Winona Ryder, Billy Bob Thornton, Mickey Rourke, Amber Heard and Kim Basinger. It was Brad Renfro's last film before his death.\n\nReviewing the book for \"The New York Times\", Michiko Kakutani wrote that Ellis had written \"a novel that is as cynical, shallow and stupid as the people it depicts.\" By contrast, in the London \"Evening Standard\", Will Self said that \"The Informers shows the work of a writer at the peak of his powers, deeply concerned with the moral decline of our society.\"\n\nIn 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of \"The Informers\", narrated by Christian Rummel and Therese Plummer, as part of its \"Modern Vanguard\" line of audiobooks.\n"}

It contains a political theory, intended to reveal key political laws and to propose an adequate vision of the state.\n\nPradera’s political vision was clearly incepted by Vázquez de Mella, whom he considered a mentor and intellectual master. It was evolving gradually, in course of some 40 years, starting late 19th century. At first, its elements were expressed as press articles and various public addresses, including these in the Cortes. Later they also took shape of conference papers and historical books. The almost final expression of Pradera's political theory was incorporated in a series of articles printed throughout 1934, to be finally integrated in \"El Estado Nuevo\", the book published in Madrid in 1935.\n\n\nUpon the release of \"El Estado Nuevo\", the work was unconditionally and rather enthusiastically accepted among the Carlist intellectuals as an in-depth discourse of their ideology and a guidance for the future. Among the Spanish Right of the 1930s \"El Estado Nuevo\" made a huge intellectual impact, especially that all the competing formations, the Alfonsists from Renovacion Espanola, the Catholics from CEDA and the rapidly growing fascists from Falange were missing a comparable, detailed, integrated, visionary doctrine. The organic vision of the society and the corporativist vision of the future state were largely accepted and shared. Key differences focused on the questions of monarchy, coercive powers of state and degree of social engineering. Among the Left the vision of Pradera did not attract much attention, since Carlism and its theories were considered profoundly archaic, if not simply long dead. Some greeted \"El Estado Nuevo\" with amusement, as an utopian nonsense, rather than with hostility. On the Marxist left, be it socialist or communist, Pradera’s work was considered to be fascist. In the Francoist Spain Pradera’s vision was referred to with sympathy – Franco himself wrote a foreword to the 1945 edition of \"El Estado Nuevo\" – but never as an alleged theoretical foundation of the state. Today it is usually regarded as a monarchist version of the corporativist theory. Some historians consider Pradera's work a disintegration rather than integration of Carlism, the result of political amorphism of the 1930s.\n\n\n"}

Its world premiere was at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women. The film grew out of an initiative by the FAWE, The Forum for African Women Educationalists, with additional support from the Rockefeller Foundation and UNICEF.\n\nThe film's purpose was to address, as Robertson puts it, \"the elephant in the room\" about girls in school and allow for discussion of attitudes about the effect of education on African girls and their societies. It is currently used for training within the Peace Corps who, in statements, have described the film as \"rich in its learning opportunities as well as being beautifully filmed.\"\n\n\"\"A film about men and women, about marriage... families... having babies, about tradition, and the modern world... about who goes to school in Africa... and why girls are missing.\" - Official tag-line.\"\n\nEvery year, girls in African schools \"go missing,\" from school classrooms. This film analyzes the stories of five schoolgirls and examines the causes and consequences of the high dropout rates among girls. The stories are told directly by Malawian and Guinean girls and their families.\nAlso presented is a group of elders from a Malinké village conversing about the issue.\n\n\"These Girls Are Missing\" was initially commissioned by FAWE, The Forum for African Women Educationalists, and premiered at the United Nations’ 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing. Because of its wide range of intended audiences, the film is available in seven languages: English, French, Malinké, Susu, Poular, Ki-Swahili and Chichewa.\n\nSince its release, the film has been distributed widely by the Ministries of Education in both Guinea and Malawi, and used in focus groups and workshops promoting girls’ education. FAWE also distributed the film unto associate members in Ministries of Education in Zanzibar, Angola, Cameroon, Namibia, Tanzania, Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Seychelles, Botswana, São Tomé e Principe, Mozambique, Uganda and Ghana.\n\nThe film has also screened at Cinema du Reel, Paris; CIES (Comparative and International Education Society) Conference, Buffalo, NY; Marymount Manhattan College, NY; and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University. It has also been screened for the U.S. State Department, U.S. Agency for International Development, Inter-American Development Bank, World Council for Comparative Education Societies and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe filmmakers also produced a shorter version of the film called The Girls Know It, released in 1997. It is hosted, on screen, by The Honorable Aicha Bah, Minister of Education in Guinea. The film is shorter, at 47 minutes and was released in 1997. It is available in seven languages as well. This 47-minute cut is available in the same seven languages as the 60-minute film.\n\nUNICEF, USAID, and the Peace Corps have made extensive use of \"These Girls Are Missing\" as a training and education tool.\n\nThe film received the Cine Golden Eagle under the Documentary Feature category and a Silver Plaque as part of the 31st annual Chicago International Film Festival.\n\nMarch, 1998 \"Moving Pictures Bulletin\" reviewed the film as analyzing and contrasting situations \"represent[ing] a new generation who may finally break the cycle of girls in Africa forced to miss out on their education.\"\n\n\n"}

Arrian traces the custom to Alexander the Great when he states (\"Anabasis\" 6b.28):\n\nCertain authors have said (though to me the statement seems incredible) that Alexander led his forces through Carmania lying extended with his Companions upon two covered waggons joined together, the flute being played to him; and that the soldiers followed him wearing garlands and sporting. Food was provided for them, as well as all kinds of dainties which had been brought together along the roads by the Carmanians. They say that he did this in imitation of the Bacchic revelry of Dionysus, because a story was told about that deity, that after subduing the Indians he traversed the greater part of Asia in this manner and received the appellation of \"Thriambus\", and that for the same reason the processions in honour of victories after war were called \"thriambi\".\nThe term's etymology is connected with the word \"fig leaf\" by Aemilius Luetcke (1829) who refers to the epithet \"of the fig tree\" of Dionysus.\n\nAn old hypothesis is that the word is borrowed from Phrygian or Pelasgian, and literally means \"Dreischritt\", i. e., \"three-step\", compare \"iamb\" and \"dithyramb\", but H. S. Versnel rejects this etymology and suggests instead a derivation from a cultic exclamation.\n\nFrom the time of Roman Greece (2nd century BC), the Greek term increasingly narrows to a translation of Latin \"triumphus\". In Modern Greek, is used in the same generalized meaning as English \"triumph\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39213417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39213417", "title": "Vertical Roll", "text": "Vertical Roll\n\nVertical Roll is a 1972 video art piece by American video and performance artist Joan Jonas. It is a sequel to Jonas' first video work \"Organic Honey's Visual Telepathy\". Jonas' interfacing with the material grammar of video was significant to the late 1960s and early 1970s experimentation with new video technology. Among others, Steina and Woody Vasulka, Nam June Paik and Peter Campus also contributed to the emergent material discourse of video art.\n\nShot in Ace Gallery Los Angeles, Vertical Roll features Jonas performing a series of actions under her alter-ego \"Organic Honey\", the belly dancer. The video was shot during one of the rehearsals for Jonas' \"Organic Honey\" performance, and while it is mostly based off the structure of a vertical roll it does contain some images from \"Visual Telepathy\". To Jonas the video offered a new means to approach perception and offer \"multiple and simultaneous points of view\". Vertical Roll provided Jonas a means to explore the disjunction between performance and a recording of that performance. She places a heavy emphasis on time, and both physical and mental space in her explanation of the work.\n\n\"Vertical Roll\" combines both video and the performance space. As an installation alongside the \"Organic Honey\" performance it makes use of both live action and recorded video. The performance, on and off camera, plays on the disjunction between the two modes of presentation. Jonas' intentional mediation of \"the monitor's receiving and transmitting frequencies\" causes the image being displayed to repeatedly travel vertically from the bottom of the screen to the top resulting in the \"vertical roll\" for which the piece is titled. The vertical roll, in and of itself, is one \"of the primary technical features of video\". Jonas' manipulation of the vertical hold function on a CRT monitor to mimic the vertical movement of film through a projector, placing the piece in clear dialog with the cinematic tradition. This dialog is seen in Jonas' technical handling of the video in which video \"shifts have to become registered either by camera movement... or by cutting\".\n\nCast as an “electronic erotic seductress,” the multiple costumes and roles performed by Jonas critically examine the ever-changing, but consistently unequal roles of women. The \"Organic Honey\" videos showcased Jonas' early exploration into \"the narcissistic qualities of video\" and would later provide the foundation for proceeding video works. The camera gazes at Jonas, implicating the viewer in the work and further, with her body. Jonas presents her collection of images through multiple perspectives that are dependent \"in terms of the camera's distance and its orientation to horizontal ground\". The de-synchronization of the monitor's receiving and transmitting frequencies results in the constant wiping away of the images on screen which renders the images recognizable but gives them the illusion of being invisible. The illusion created is perceptual. it is \"one of a continuous dissolve through time and space\". \"Vertical Roll\" introduces the paradigm of the body existing in a space between the video and the monitor. The monitor becomes a metaphorical stand-in for the reel and this metaphor is only further enhanced through the continuous action of the vertical roll which references the \"physical reality of the tape deck\". Creating a sense of fragmentation, the vertical roll relentlessly pounds at the images of the artist as she moves through a series of performed identities. Characterized a \"disjunctive self portrait\" by the Electronic Arts Intermix, the image content of the work is strongly mediated by the mirror-like function of the camera, scrutinized by the lens and subjected to violence by the vertical roll.\n\nThe disparity between the video monitor, the repeating percussive sound, and the on-screen image are examples of the use of de-synchronization as a conceptual tool for revealing the contingency of perceptual experience. This disparity relies on the instability of Jonas' images juxtaposed with their cementation as visible through the use of the video medium. An example of the perceptual confusions created in Jonas' \"Vertical Roll\" can be seen in the sequence where \"Jonas bangs a spoon against a mirror, creating the illusions of a relationship between the sounds and the image disturbance\". Jonas matches action and sound to the timing of the vertical roll which creates the idea of simultaneous occurrences in the video.\n\nTemporality is made a part of \"Vertical Roll\" through the disjunctive nature of the video, and this sense of time is \"understood as propulsion towards an end.\" Time is visualized through a constant wiping away of the image. Through de-synchronization, the artist posed a challenge to the supposed objectivity of experience from the senses, potentially uncovering pretenses or dispositions that inform the processing of sensory data. The images on screen seem to decompose in their constant scanning from the bottom to the top of the screen. Jonas further enhances the effects of de-synchronization through her movements which are \"choreographed in relation to the action of the vertical roll.\"\n\nJonas explores the notion of the frame extensively in \"Vertical Roll\" as an expression of “standing one’s ground against external forces.” By recording a CRT playing back video, Jonas creates a frame within a frame, and then creating the image that the frame is collapsing in on itself every half second or so by adjusting the vertical roll on the monitor. While visually excluding the outside world nearly the entire piece, sounds accompanying the crashing frame dictate some kind of external operator attempting to beat along with the CRT’s image, expanding the scope of the piece beyond the video. In the concluding moments of her video Jonas breaks the frame entirely when she inserts her head in between the camera and the monitor, entering from the outer edge of the frame, destroying the symbolic wall the camera creates and adding another level of spatial fragmentation and self-reflection. The introduction of Jonas' head is an act of agency independent of the vertical roll. It renders the vertical roll visible and reveals the space of the video to the viewer, shattering its perceptual illusion. The disjunction caused by the concluding moments of this video highlights the implications of video presented, or displayed, in the space of the monitor.\n\nJonas claims that Vertical Roll finds a likeness to The Garden of Forking Paths a work by Jorge Luis Borges.\n"}

THE CASTLE OF BENTHEIM. Sm. 16. The castle \nstands in the left middle distance on the rocky summit of a hill. To the right is a valley through which runs a road. In front are masses of rock between which flows a stream forming a little waterfall. On the left bank a shattered tree-trunk, beside the stump, lies diagonally across the stream. Farther back the stream widens ; on the left bank a shepherd \ndrives his sheep forward. A fine picture, full of light. [Pendant to 319.] \n\nSigned in full to the right on a rock ; canvas, 27 inches by 21 inches. Engraved by W. Unger. Sales. G. G. Baron Taets van Amerongen, Amsterdam, July 3, 1805, No. 35 (750 florins, Josi). p. de Smeth van Alphen, Amsterdam, August i, 1810, No. 86 (740 florins, Coclers) ; pendant to No. 85. In the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 1910 catalogue, No. 2080; it was there \nin 1835 (Sm., who valued it at £ 350).\"\n\nThis scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael made in this period of Burg Bentheim and these often showed the castle on a high hill, though in reality it is only slightly elevated above the surrounding plain.\n\nLittle is known of Ruisdael's trip to Bentheim. It is speculated that he took a grand tour like many of his contemporaries did, but they were mostly interested in travel to Italy and headed southwards, not eastwards as Ruisdael had done. Sources are unclear about the reason the artist would travel to Bentheim to paint it. Bentheim is a small German town near the Dutch border about 26 kilometers beyond Ootmarsum, a town Ruisdael painted, and adjoins the town of Schüttorf, which Ruisdael sketched from across the river Vechte. In those days, people of Haarlem and Amsterdam were more likely to travel by foot or by trekschuit than by horse and buggy. Ruisdael's paintings also often show people walking along sandy tracks or traveling in boats, but only the cart tracks in his paintings show the traffic from other forms of transport. If he travelled eastwards by boat, then this could explain why he made so many sketches of water mills and sluices. There has been speculation that Ruisdael accompanied an expedition to acquire Bentheimer sandstone for building the new Amsterdam Town Hall, an ambitious project by mayor Nicolaes Tulp that employed many artists, including the Haarlem architect Jacob van Campen as master builder. Bentheimer sandstone was a popular product being used to build canal mansions along the new canals of Amsterdam. In Haarlem, the facade of the house of Pieter Teyler van der Hulst is cladded with Bentheimer sandstone, and though this was probably done later in the 1740s, it shows hows the popularity of this material overshadowed the use of Namur stone from Belgium, the material used earlier in the 17th century for cladding of the Waag, Haarlem, which is a few doors down from Teyler's house. However it is also entirely plausible that Ruisdael was invited to the castle to paint it, but little is known of the art collection in the castle at that time.\n\nRuisdael was even tempted to make a dramatic sweeping version of the castle that was copied almost in mirror image by Haarlem contemporary Nicolaes Berchem, called \"his great friend\" by Ruisdael biographer Arnold Houbraken. It is assumed that the artists travelled together, but no archival evidence beyond dated artworks survive which support this.\n"}
