{"id": "18559170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18559170", "title": "Art Renewal Center", "text": "Art Renewal Center\n\nThe Art Renewal Center (ARC) is a non-profit, educational organization, which hosts an online museum dedicated to realist art. The ARC was founded by New Jersey businessman and art collector Fred Ross.\n\nParticular emphasis is given to nineteenth-century Salon painting. William-Adolphe Bouguereau, who is represented by more than 226 images on the site; Ross says that Bouguereau's work is accessed twice as often as any other artist on the site.\n\nThe Art Renewal Center is devoted to the rehabilitation of late nineteenth-century academic painting. Ross feels that there has been a \"concerted and relentless effort to disparage, denigrate and obliterate the reputations, names and brilliance of the academic artistic masters of the late 19th century.\" The Art Renewal Center is intended as a platform for Ross and his supporters to \"extol the virtues of academic artists and castigate nearly everything associated with modern art.\" The ARC describes itself as offering \"responsible views opposing that of the current art establishment\".\nRoss is a strong admirer of Adolphe Bouguereau's work. In 2002 he spoke to the New York Society of Portrait Artists and described the impression made on him in the Clark Art Institute (Williamstown, Massachusetts) by Bouguereau's painting, \"Nymphs and Satyr\":\nFrozen in place, gawking with my mouth agape, cold chills careening up and down my spine, I was virtually gripped as if by a spell that had been cast. Years of undergraduate courses and another 60 credits post-graduate in art, and I had never heard [Bouguereau's] name. Who was he? Was he important? Anyone who could have done this must surely be deserving of the highest accolades in the art world.\n\nArtist and blogger Mark Vallen stated on his web site that the ARC assertions \"are not incorrect when noting the follies of modern art, but their total rejection of it is beyond the pale and thoroughly reactionary.\" Vallen was critical of Bouguereau: \"Bouguereau's strength was his dedication to the craft of painting, and his technical mastery of oil painting can't be denied. If today's artists knew but a fraction of the painting skills possessed and employed by Bouguereau, they would be better off. Nevertheless, Bouguereau was also imprisoned by his extremely conservative vision of what painting could be—and that was his greatest weakness.\"\n"}

Acting roles in television, film, and theater were relatively few, and many available roles were for narrow, stereotypical characters. Early Asian American actors such as Sessue Hayakawa, Anna May Wong, and Bruce Lee encountered a movie-making culture that wanted to cast them as caricatures. Or like actress Merle Oberon who hid her heritage so she wouldn't have been discriminated by Hollywood's racist laws.\n\nBruce Lee abandoned Hollywood in the early 1970s and achieved worldwide fame in Hong Kong. On another level, frustrated with the limited opportunities given to them, seven Asian American actors formed East West Players (EWP), a Los Angeles-based Asian American theater company, in 1965, to produce their own shows, and the company continues today.\n\nBruce Lee has made a substantial impact with martial arts and entertainment. He claimed to not fit into the established martial arts scene in San Francisco when he arrived in 1959. Lee encountered a diverse group of martial artists within the bay area who held a similar philosophy.\n\nLee signed a two-film contract, eventually bringing his family over to Hong Kong as well. Towards the end of 1972, Lee was a major movie star in Asia.\n\nMore recently, young Asian American comedians and filmmakers have also found an outlet on YouTube and the Internet, allowing them to gain a strong and loyal fanbase. Notable YouTubers include comedians such as Ryan Higa, Kevin Wu, entertainers such as Dan Chan and Christine Gambito; musicians such as MC Jin, Far East Movement, Sam Tsui, David Choi, and Kina Grannis; and the filmmaking group Wong Fu Productions. These entertainers have gained notable followings, mainly with young Asian American students, through solo and collaborative videos, short films and tours.\n\nAdditionally, other Asian American artists have broken out into mainstream audiences beyond the Asian American community. Those include artists such as Bruno Mars, Darren Criss, and The Slants.\n\nChang and Eng Bunker had a stable career in entertainment.\nCheng and Eng Buker were conjoined twins who rose to popularity known as the \"Siamese Twins\" in the 19th century. They were born in 1811 in a village sixty miles from Bangkok. Cheng and Eng were conjoined at the chest at birth, thus starting their career as a human spectacle. They were gawked at in their own country before coming to America at age eighteen. Touring city to city, they were well received, giving performances that featured their unique physiognomy and also highlighted their distinctive wit and innate intelligence. After ten years, at the age of twenty-eight, Chang and Eng retired and decided to settle down in Wilkes County in western North Carolina where they also adopted the surname \"Bunker.\" In North Carolina, they married sisters Sarah Ann and Adelaide yates and began their lives as southern gentlemen by managing their individual households, plantations, and slaves. The former Siamese Twins from the countryside outside of Bangkok became the wealthiest men in the county and the patriarchs of two large families (between the two, there were twenty-one children). When need be, they returned to touring in order to accumulate more funds. In 1873, both Chang and Eng passed away at age sixty-two.\n\nDespite few Asian/Asian-American entertainers in the 19th century, many entertainment platforms attempt to depict accurate occurrences in 19th century Asia, such as Dunhuang Performative Arts company and their performances exhibiting the journey of the Silk Road in \"Dunhuang, My Dreamland.\" The show portrays Daoist priest Wang Yuanlu in accurate garb and performed by an appropriate actor, Chen Yizong. The playwright sets the stage at the Dunhunag Magao Caves which was historically important for travelers along the Silk Road, especially Buddhist monks from India and central Asia while on their journey to Chang'an (now Xi'an). Among meditations, the caves were used to reference the monastery's texts and records.\n\nAnna May Wong was the first actor of Asian descent to be the leading star of an American television series when she starred on the television series \"The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong\".\nGeorge Takei and Pat Morita became famous for supporting roles in \"\" and \"Happy Days\". In 1976, Morita starred on the first American sitcom centered on a person of Asian descent, \"Mr. T and Tina\" and went on to become widely known as the mentor Mr. Miyagi in \"The Karate Kid\" movies of the 1980s. Other Asian Americans from this period include Bruce Lee on \"The Green Hornet\" and Jack Soo of \"Barney Miller\". Also noteworthy was Keye Luke, who portrayed Master Po on the television series \"Kung Fu\", and was the voice of Charlie Chan on the 1972 animated series \"The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan\", which featured a mystery solving Chinese American family.\nMargaret Cho, stand-up comedian and actress, had a leading role in her own comedy series \"All-American Girl\" in the 1990s. Her character was a Korean-American (as is Cho), who struggled with her family and cultural issues in San Francisco. The series included other Asian American actors such as Amy Hill. Despite being groundbreaking in prime-time television, \"All American Girl\" was cancelled after one season due to low ratings. After its run, due to the way it was handled and the pressures that were forced on her to conform to vague mainstream expectations to try to make the series a success, Cho suffered a huge psychotic break and self-disappointment that led to her drug and alcohol addiction. (It would later be revealed that female stars of even successful sitcoms go through similar trials as related by Roseanne Barr in her story for \"New York Magazine\" in 2011.) Cho has since regained popularity and success from her 2000 one-woman show \"I'm the One That I Want\" and through her current involvement on \"Drop Dead Diva\" on Lifetime.\n\nAmy Hill has since been a mainstay of U.S. television for years as a recurring/character actress, some of her most notable roles include, Mrs. DePaulo on \"That's So Raven\", Mama Tohru on \"Jackie Chan Adventures\", Mrs. Hasagawa on \"\", Ah-Mah Jasmine Lee on \"The Life and Times of Juniper Lee\", Judy Harvey on \"Enlightened\", Mah Mah on \"American Dad!\", Dr. Wagerstein on \"UnREAL\", and now Lourdes Chan on \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\".\n\nLucy Liu had a major role on the television series \"Ally McBeal\" from 1998 to 2002 where she was nominated for an Emmy Award.

She became a fashion icon during the silent film era, beginning with her success in the film \"The Toll of the Sea\" (1922), the first color feature to be made in Hollywood. During her career she sought roles that portrayed Chinese and Asian Americans in a positive light, but these films never became famous except for a select few such as the film \"Daughter of Shanghai\" (1937). Frustrated by being stereotyped and typecast during her career in the United States, she moved to Europe, where she appeared in many plays and films, the most notable of which was the British film \"Piccadilly\" (1929). She later returned to the United States in an ironic twist, at a time when American studios were searching Europe for fresh new talent, despite the fact that she is an American. She returned with promises of leading roles, but these did not come about due to racism in the United States. She eventually stopped acting in professional films and turned to stage, cabaret, B movies, and anti-Japanese propaganda films such as \"Bombs Over Burma\" (1943) due to her being an advocacy against the Japanese aggression in China. She was set to make her comeback with the film \"Flower Drum Song\" (1961) but was unable due to failing health. Despite a prolific career Wong's only film to have ever been a truly big success was \"Shanghai Express\" (1932).\nSessue Hayakawa was the first and one of the few Asian American/Asian actors to find stardom in the United States and Europe and was also the first leading Asian male actor in the United States. He became the first male sex symbol of Hollywood long before and the precursor to Rudolph Valentino. His fame rivaled that of Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin. His fame began during the silent film era, leading into sound pictures in his later life. He became a film actor in a somewhat reluctant and accidental manner when the famous producer Thomas Ince saw his theatre play \"The Typhoon\" and wanted to turn it into a silent film and when it was released the film was an instant hit. With rising stardom he was eventually offered film contract by Famous Players-Lasky now Paramount Pictures. His second film with the production company, \"The Cheat\" (1915), was a success and made him a romantic hit with U.S. female audiences. He became a leading man of romance films, considered a heartthrob and a sex symbol; many actresses wanted to work with him in films, in which he was often cast as the exotic male Asian lover that women desired. After years of being typecast as a villain and exotic Asian lover that white women could not have, he decided to start his own production company, where he eventually made 23 films; he produced, starred in, and directed them, and contributed to their design, writing and editing. His films also influenced the way the United States viewed Asians. He personally chose American actress Marin Sais to appear opposite him in his films such as \"The City of Dim Faces\" and \"His Birthright\". Hayakawa's collaboration with Sais ended with the film \"Bonds of Honor\" (1919). In 1919, Hayakawa made what is generally considered one of his best films, \"The Dragon Painter\". After some bad business, he left the United States and for the next 15 years he worked in Europe and Japan where he made many popular films and plays such as the films \"The Great Prince Chan\" and the play \"Samurai\" which he performed for the king and queen of the United Kingdom at that time King George V and Queen Mary and a stage play version of \"The Three Musketeers\". His fame in France came from France's fascination with anything Asian. In the 1930s with the rise of Talkies and growing Anti-Japanese sentiment due to World War II. During the war, he tried to perform in Europe but eventually became trapped by the Germans and for years was not able to work as an actor until Humphrey Bogart tracked him and down and offered him a role in his film \"Tokyo Joe\" (1949) which became a hit and afterwards he did another successful film \"Three Came Home\" (1950). After the war his image in films this time was as the honorable villain which he became typecasted as and from it he starred in what is considered to be his most famous film of his entire career \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957) for which he was nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award.\nMerle Oberon an actress of Old Hollywood starred in many successful films, and was nominated for the Oscar for Best actress for the film \"The Dark Angel\" (1935) and is most renowned for her performance in the film version of \"Wuthering Heights\" (1939).

Haing Ngor won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for \"The Killing Fields\" (1984).\n\nSho Kosugi achieved stardom in the United States and internationally during the 1980s. After thrilling audiences as the third lead and villain in \"Enter the Ninja\" (1981), he was given the solo lead starring role as the hero in the follow-up film \"Revenge of the Ninja\" (1983). Like Bruce Lee did with Kung Fu in the 1970s, Sho Kosugi ignited a worldwide Ninja craze in the 1980s with his films. And similar to the Bruceploitation phenomenon that followed Lee's death, many copy-cat ninja films were made following the worldwide popularity of Sho's early ninja films. A number of films produced in Hong Kong and Taiwan even used Sho's image on their posters and home video covers, despite the fact that Mr. Kosugi was not involved in these productions. Sho's image as a ninja was used and continues to be used on unsanctioned T-shirts, posters, fans, collectibles, and even Video game covers like The Last Ninja. Following his starring role in \"Revenge of the Ninja\", he would go on to be the lead star in 6 more American films: \"\" (1984), \"9 Deaths of the Ninja\" (1985), \"Pray For Death\" (1985), \"Rage of Honor\" (1987), \"Black Eagle\" (1988), and \"Journey of Honor\" (1991) which he also produced and co-wrote.

After 16 years off the silver screen, Sho returned as the lead villain in \"Ninja Assassin\" (2009) produced by Hollywood heavyweights the Wachowskis, Joel Silver and Grant Hill, and directed by James McTeigue: \"If you've ever watched any ninja films from the 1980s, you know that Sho Kosugi is the ninja; he is the man,\" asserts McTeigue.\n\nMako Iwamatsu was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for \"The Sand Pebbles\" (1966).

She also was the first Asian American woman to host \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2000. She also recently had hit releases with the film \"Kung Fu Panda\" (2008) and its sequel \"Kung Fu Panda 2\" (2011).\n\nJohn Cho, a Korean-born American actor, famously portrayed Hikaru Sulu in the \"Star Trek\" reboot, as well as appearing in the first \"American Pie\" series and the \"Harold & Kumar\" series along with Indian American actor Kal Penn. Penn, also starred in \"The Namesake\", one of his favorite books, taught a course and seminar on images of Asian Americans in the media at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nMaking waves in the entertainment industry, Korean-born, US-raised actor Ki Hong Lee rose to international fame as Minho in the film adaptation of James Dashner's book series, \"The Maze Runner\".\n\nMing-Na Wen, Ryan Potter and Jordan Nagai starred in highly impacting voice roles in the animated Disney and Pixar films \"Mulan\" (1998), \"Up\" (2009) and \"Big Hero 6\" (2014).\n\nMaggie Q after achieving fame in Hong Kong has since starred in big budget and big box office films \"\" (2006), \"Live Free or Die Hard\" (2007) and most recently as the character Tori Wu in \"The Divergent Series\" and will have three upcoming films. Daniel Henney also having gained fame overseas in South Korea has since starred in American films \"\" (2009), \"The Last Stand\" (2013), and the animated Oscar-winning Disney film \"Big Hero 6\" (2014).\n\nThe international star Joan Chen (Chong Chen) was featured in numerous films from China, the United States, Australia, and many other countries. She has won numerous awards for her acting and has also directed a film.\n\nSouth-Korean actor and superstar Lee Byung-hun, has already starred in numerous American production including \"Red 2\" (2013), \"\" (2009), \"\" (2013) and \"Terminator Genisys\" (2015). Indian superstar and actress Priyanka Chopra is beginning to work in American cinema and is currently filming the action comedy \"Baywatch\" (2017).\n\n2017 was a landmark year for Asian-American actors in major film projects. Jacob Batalon, a Filipino-American actor, starred as Ned in \"\". Kumail Nanjiani, a Pakistani American actor, starred as the eponymous male lead in \"The Big Sick\", a film which he also co-wrote. Hong Chau received nominations for Best Supporting Actress from the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild for her role of Ngoc Lan Tran in \"Downsizing\".

Although much of Ang Lee's work does not deal specifically with Asian people, themes or settings, Lee has made one film in his native Taiwan (\"Eat Drink Man Woman\") and two films in mainland China (\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" and \"Lust, Caution\"). In addition, his first two features, \"Pushing Hands\" and \"The Wedding Banquet\", both set in the United States, deal primarily with Taiwanese and Chinese American characters and their attempts to navigate between the demands of their ancestral traditions and contemporary American culture. \"Pushing Hands\" deals with an interracial marriage where the man, of Chinese ancestry, has brought his traditional-minded father to live with the family, which is a source of tension with his wife until they learn to appreciate one another's cultures. \"The Wedding Banquet\" is a comedy that deals with a young, prosperous Taiwanese-born gay man who lives and works in New York, and his attempts to conceal his sexual orientation from his visiting parents, who are pushing him to marry.\n\nM. Night Shyamalan has directed a number of movies, including \"Signs\", \"The Village\", \"Unbreakable\", and the Academy Award-nominated \"The Sixth Sense\".\n\nMira Nair has acclaimed movies including \"Salaam Bombay\", \"Monsoon Wedding\" and \"The Namesake\" to her credit.\n\nDirector Justin Lin brought attention to the experiences of Asian Americans through his movie \"Better Luck Tomorrow\", which included an almost exclusively Asian American cast.

But Toilet Paper Is Expensive\", \"Chinese Box\", \"A Thousand Years of Good Prayers\", \"The Princess of Nebraska\", \"The Joy Luck Club\", and \"Eat a Bowl of Tea\". He was very well known in the 90s for directing the hit Independent film \"Smoke\" and he has also had mainstream success with the films \"Anywhere but Here\", \"Maid in Manhattan\", and \"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan\".\n\nGregg Araki is an influential American independent filmmaker of Japanese ancestry, who is especially noted for his often playful, punk-influenced work dealing with young, often gay, members of generation X trying to define themselves in the wake of the AIDS epidemic, rampant consumerism, and childhood trauma. His films such as \"The Doom Generation\", \"The Living End\" and \"Nowhere\" were seen to exemplify the alienation and hedonistic abandon of their times, while his 2004 film \"Mysterious Skin\", featuring Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a dramatic role, was highly acclaimed for a dark and realistic portrait of the effects of child sexual abuse.\n\nSo Yong Kim is a Korean American independent filmmaker who was awarded the Special Jury Prize at Sundance for her debut feature, \"In Between Days\", which was shot in Toronto, but was loosely based on her own experiences growing up in Los Angeles as a newly arrived immigrant who felt alienated from the surrounding world. In the film, the protagonist is a teenage Korean girl transplanted to North America who must take responsibility for her own life as her mother is not around much and her father is estranged from the family. A raw, largely improvised romance shot digitally with first-time actors, \"In Between Days\" received enough attention for Kim to make her next film, the childhood drama \"Treeless Mountain\", in her birth country of South Korea. Her latest and third feature, \"For Ellen\", is set in the United States and stars Paul Dano as a man going through a divorce.\n\nMajor films have been based on Asian American novels, such as Jhumpa Lahiri's \"The Namesake\" (2007) and Amy Tan's \"The Joy Luck Club\".

He received an nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for his efforts.\n\nLin Yutang and his work \"Chinatown Family\" strays from the film representation of Asian Americans and attempts to depict the accurate representation of Asian Americans during the 1950s. Lin's works were considered Orientalist, seeing as they were a polar opposite to the style of most Asian American writers after 1965. Yet, Lin's works are still ignored when studying the history of Asian American genealogy and subjectivity.\n\nThroughout the 1990s there was a growing amount of Asian American queer writings and today the list of contributing writers is long. To name a few: Merle Woo (1941), Russell Leong (1950), Dwight Okita (1958), Norman Wong (1963), Chay Yew (1965), and Justin Chin (1969).\n\nWah Chang was the designer for many of the props on the \"Star Trek\" series as well as \"The Time Machine\", which received an Academy Award for special effects.\n\nJames Wong, a Hong Kong-born writer raised in the US, was a writer, co-executive producer and consulting producer of \"The X-Files\" in its first, second and fourth seasons (1993–1997); co-creator, producer and writer of the TV series \"\" (1995–1996); and writer, consulting producer and co-executive producer of \"Millennium\" in its first and second seasons (1996–1998). Before \"The X-Files\", Wong had worked as a writer on police dramas such as \"21 Jump Street\", \"The Commish\", \"Booker\" and \"Wiseguy\" as well as on the script for the independent crime film \"The Boys Next Door\" (1984), starring Charlie Sheen in his first leading role. Wong later wrote, produced and directed horror and action films such as \"Final Destination\" (2000) and the Jet Li-starring \"The One\" (2001), and he was hired by 20th Century Fox to direct \"Dragonball Evolution\" (2009), although like other producers and crew members on that production, complained of having little creative input as the studio made all the major decisions. As part of the initial production crew on \"The X-Files\", Wong was among the most influential four writer-producers who worked closely with \"X-Files\" creator Chris Carter to define the characters, plots and aesthetics of the new series (the others were Glen Morgan, Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa). Wong was responsible with his longtime writing partner Glen Morgan for introducing a number of elements that defined \"The X-Files\" throughout its run. Wong co-wrote \"Squeeze,\" only the second \"X-Files\" episode ever produced, and the first \"monster of the week\" episode, which would provide a template for two thirds of the future episodes of the series; \"Ice,\" the first episode to focus centrally on the Mulder/Scully relationship as the key to its plot; \"Beyond the Sea,\" the first episode to receive notable critical acclaim beyond the science fiction genre, the first episode with serious character development for Gillian Anderson in her role as Dana Scully, and also Carter's personal favorite episode of the series; \"E.B.E.,\" the first episode to introduce The Lone Gunmen trio of characters, whose popularity resulted in their own short-lived spinoff series (without Wong's participation) in 2001; \"Tooms,\" the first episode to introduce the character of Walter Skinner, Mulder and Scully's boss, who would become a more central character over the remainder of the series, and also the first episode to give a speaking part to the Cigarette Smoking Man, the main nemesis of Mulder and Scully for most of the series' run; \"Little Green Men,\" the first mythology episode to make use of voiceover and flashback; \"Blood,\" the first episode to include a story contribution from Glen Morgan's brother Darin Morgan, who would become the most acclaimed \"X-Files\" writer and the only one to win an Emmy for his writing; \"3,\" the first episode in which Mulder or Scully was involved in a sexual situation; \"One Breath,\" the resolution episode for the abduction plot that was the foundation of the series' long running mythology; \"Die Hand Die Verletzt,\" the first episode in which Kim Manners, who became the series' most prolific director over its nine seasons, was brought on board to direct, being an acquaintance of Morgan and Wong from their work with Manners on previous TV series; and \"Home,\" the first episode to be preceded by a warning from the network that it was intended for mature audiences only due to its disturbing content. James Wong, in his directorial debut, also directed the episode \"Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man,\" for which he received an Emmy nomination, also becoming the first member of the series's regular writing staff (after Chris Carter) to direct an episode, as well as the only person of color to ever direct an X-Files episode. Wong's Emmy nomination for directing \"Musings\" made him the first Asian American to receive an Emmy nomination for directing anything on television; at that time, no Asian American and no person of Chinese descent had yet been nominated for an Oscar for directing a film. Wong was also, along with Chris Carter (nominated a year later) the only director of an \"X-Files\" episode to be Emmy nominated for his work. As part of \"The X-Files\" main production team in 1994–1995, Wong shared the show's first Golden Globe Award win for Best Dramatic Series, and also shared its second win (\"The X-Files\" would become the first series to win a Golden Globe three times) in the 1996–1997 season.\n\nMindy Kaling, a Dartmouth graduate, has been involved from the beginning in the production of the American series of \"The Office\", having originally been the only female writer on a staff of eight; since the show's eighth season she has been an executive producer. She has since created her own show, \"The Mindy Project\" which she produces, writes, and stars in.\n\nLance Fong was the director of photography on recent Hollywood hits \"300\", \"The Watchmen\", \"Super 8\", and \"Suckerpunch\".\n\nMark Yoshikawa was the editor on several of Terrence Malick's films, including \"The New World, The Tree of Life, \"and will be on the forthcoming \"Knight of Cups.\"\n\nCurt Apduhan is a NATAS News/Documentary Cinematography Emmy awarded cinematographer for the Sundance Channel feature documentary \"Amargosa\", about a dancer who performs regularly in an opera house in a California ghost town.\n\nIn 2007, Myx TV became the first Asian American music, entertainment and lifestyle network.\n\nThe 2018 film Crazy Rich Asians, directed by Jon M. Chu, featured several Asian American actors in prominent roles, alongside other actors of Asian descent.\n\nThe musical \"Flower Drum Song\" was based on the 1957 novel, \"The Flower Drum Song,\" by Chinese-American author C. Y. Lee, which in turn was based on the San Francisco nightclub Forbidden City that was popular for military men in transit during World War II. Rodgers and Hammerstein adapted it into a musical produced on Broadway in 1958 and on film in 1961, and both starred a number of Asian American actors. Largely remembered for the hit song \"I Enjoy Being A Girl\", it would not be produced with an all-Asian American cast until a 2002 Broadway revival.\n\nIn 1965, frustrated with the limited opportunities given to them, actors Mako, James Hong, Beulah Quo, Pat Li, and June Kim, together with Guy Lee and Yet Lock, formed East West Players (EWP), a Los Angeles-based Asian American theater company – the first of its kind. They produced their own shows to allow Asian American actors the opportunity to perform a wide range of leading roles. As the need still exists, EWP continues today. Dozens of other Asian American theater companies have since formed in major cities throughout the USA, providing similar outlets elsewhere.\n\nIn 1988, playwright David Henry Hwang's Broadway hit \"M. Butterfly\" won a Tony Award for Best Play, among other awards. Singer and actress Lea Salonga, who broke out in the lead role in the musical \"Miss Saigon\", was also the first Asian to play the roles of Éponine and Fantine in the musical \"Les Misérables\" on Broadway, and is still active on Broadway.\n\nMargaret Cho won the American Comedy Award for Best Female Comedian in 1994. Comedian Byron Yee's show \"Paper Son\" was awarded \"Outstanding Solo Show\" at the New York International Fringe Festival.\n\nTelly Leung started his Broadway career in 2002 as a performer in \"Flower Drum Song\".

Craig originated the role of Marcy Park, the first Korean-American character on Broadway.\n\n\"Disgraced\", a play about Islamophobia, written by Pakistani American Ayad Akhtar won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Actors that have played the lead role include Aasif Mandvi and Hari Dhillon.\n\n\"Allegiance\", which ran on Broadway from October 2015 to February 2016, is set during the Japanese American internment of World War II (with a framing story set in the present day), and was inspired by the personal experiences of George Takei, who stars in the musical along with Lea Salonga.\n\nPhillipa Soo starred as Natasha Rostova in \"Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812\" in the Off-Broadway productions, and as Elizabeth Schuyler in the original Broadway cast of \"Hamilton\", winning a cast Grammy Award for musical theater album.\n\nKimiko Glenn starred as Dawn in the original Broadway cast of \"Waitress\", the musical adaption of the film of the same name.\n\nNotable works of world architecture have been designed by Asian Americans, such as the Louvre Pyramid (I. M. Pei), the World Trade Center (Minoru Yamasaki), and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (Maya Lin). In commercial architecture, Gyo Obata is a founding partner of HOK (formerly Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum), which designed the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. and the Taipei World Trade Center. Fazlur Rahman Khan designed the John Hancock Center and the Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower), both in Chicago.\n\nMany Asian Americans have made their mark in the fashion world. Vera Wang, friend to Anna Wintour, and Anna Sui have been working as highly accomplished and awarded fashion designers for years. Philippines-born Monique Lhuillier's dresses are on the Hollywood red carpet and Vietnamese-American Chloe Dao won \"Project Runway\" in spring 2006. Other designers include Phillip Lim, 2006 CFDA Emerging Talent Award Winner Doo-Ri Chung, and 2005 Winner Derek Lam; all three have been featured in \"Vogue\" magazine several times. At the Fashion Institute of Technology, 23 percent of the nearly 1,200 students now enrolled are either Asian or Asian American.\n\nWith the advent of YouTube, young Asian Americans have become more prominent, gaining large followings through filmmaking, comedy, or music. This includes video bloggers/comedians such as The Fung Brothers, Kevin Wu, Anna Akana, Ryan Higa and the filmmaking group Wong Fu Productions. The latter's growing influence is evident especially in Wong Fu Productions' annual concert series, International Secret Agents (ISA), which often sell out, and in which many popular Asian American guest performers appear, including Far East Movement or Poreotics. Kevin Wu's recent appearance on the 17th season of \"The Amazing Race\" marked another significant venture into mainstream media. These along with other rising Asian American talents have shared and documented their journey in Asian American blogs, including channelAPA.com \"Amped Asia\" magazine, \"Hyphen\" magazine, and \"Mochi\".\n\nRaks Geek, founded by Chinese/Singaporean American Dawn Xiana Moon is a majority Asian-American bellydance and fire performance company best known for their bellydancing Wookiee viral video and other cosplay/nerd-themed dance work. The group's diverse roster features Hmong and Filipino performers as well, and most have performed around the world.\n\nBrothers Jimmy Wong and Freddie Wong also own popular YouTube channels, with the former acting in and the latter producing the web series Video Game High School.\n\nMark Edward Fischbach is another example of a popular Asian American on YouTube. His YouTube channel and name online, Markiplier, is dedicated to gaming videos and comedy. With about 20 million subscribers and his channel reaching about 9 billion total views, Markiplier's internet fame has helped him raise over 3 million dollars for charity. In 2016, Markiplier won the Make-A-Wish Foundation's celebrity of the year award alongside voice actor Tom Kenny and the Dallas Cowboys football team.\n\nAsian American writers have received numerous top awards in fiction and nonfiction writing. Women writers have been particularly prominent for their work of telling a wide range of stories of immigrant experience, changing cultures and aspects of Asian American imagination, spanning continents, eras and points of view. Maxine Hong Kingston won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1976 for her memoir \"The Woman Warrior\". Hisaye Yamamoto received an American Book Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1986.

His best-known works are the CD /record covers for Ice-T and tour apparel for bands such as No Doubt, Stone Temple Pilots, Kurtis Blow, Fishbone and others.\n\nAsian Americans are increasingly enjoying success in mainstream hip hop and R&B such as MC Jin. A few notable examples are multi-racial Amerie, Cassie, Ne-Yo, who is one-quarter Chinese, Filipino-American Nicole Scherzinger who is of Filipino, Hawaiian, and Ukrainian descent apl.de.ap of The Black Eyed Peas, and Jin. There are many more Asian Americans represented in local hip-hop scenes, including rising acts like Baiyu and the Blue Scholars. In 2010 and 2011, half-Filipino singer-songwriter Bruno Mars broke into the Top 10 with his singles \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Grenade\".

In October 2010, Far East Movement became the first Asian American band to break into the Top 10 of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 with their single \"Like a G6\", which eventually reached No. 1.\n\nThere are also major underground hip hop artists who have developed a following, such as the Pakistani American rapper Bohemia who is known as the creator of Punjabi rap music.\n\nThere is a genre of music called Desi hip hop due to its contributions and influences by many nations including the USA by the South Asian diaspora including South Asian Americans especially by pioneers such as Pakistani-American Bohemia himself. Desi hip hop is one of only two music genres to have been either created by Asian Americans or have been contributed to musically by the community (in this case South Asian Americans) to the genre.\n\nAsian American jazz is a musical genre and movement in the United States begun in the 20th century by Asian American jazz musicians that has produced a number of very prominent artists. Along with Desi Hip Hop who has many origins including the USA it is currently one of only two musical genres to have been created by Asian Americans or been influenced by them. Some Asian-American Jazz artists are Toshiko Akiyoshi (piano), Vijay Iyer (piano), Rudresh Mahanthappa (alto saxophone), Jon Jang (piano), Tiger Okoshi (trumpet), Yasushi Nakamura (bass), Connie Han (piano), and Hitomi Oba (tenor saxophone).\n\nIn popular music, Asian Americans are a sizable influence, including pop divas such as part-Filipino Vanessa Hudgens, Utada Hikaru, and Lea Salonga. Folk singer-songwriter and Dawn Xiana Moon was the first to blend traditional Chinese music with Americana, pop, and jazz in the mid-2000s, and Vienna Teng is notable for a folk pop without the Eastern influences.\n\nAsian Americans play in a handful of \"all-American\" bands, including quarter-Indonesian Eddie Van Halen, James Iha of The Smashing Pumpkins, Korean American bassist and a founding member of the progressive metal group Dream Theater John Myoung, Keralan Indian Kim Thayil of Soundgarden, part-Filipino Kirk Hammett of Metallica, Satomi Matsuzaki of Deerhoof, Indian Tony Kanal of No Doubt, half-Japanese Miki Berenyi of Lush, John Famiglietti of HEALTH, Richard On of O.A.R., Joey Santiago of Pixies, Kenny Choi of Daphne Loves Derby, Hoobastank's Doug Robb and former member Derek Kwan, and Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda a Japanese American and Joseph Hahn, a Korean American.

In the 19th century, painters like Whistler and Van Gogh used various Japanese works as models for their artwork. At the same time, many Japanese painters were moving to California to blend their work with what would become new Western Techniques. Asian American art can mostly be traced back to the West Coast with artists also popping up in New York.\n\nPaul Horiuchi was a Japanese-born American painter best known for his abstract collages of torn, hand-colored mulberry paper.

Wong was also involved with the growing New York graffiti art scene of this time and collected pieces from artists like Futura 2000 and Keith Haring.\n\nUnfortunately, the Japanese Internment Camps following WWII put a halt to a lot of Asian American artists. Art that resulted from this time serves as some of the only documentation of the trials and tribulations of the many Japanese Americans who were forced into camps.\n\nRoger Shimomura is a painter and printmaker whose works combine pop culture motifs, racial stereotypes, and evocations of his childhood experiences in the Minidoka internment camp during World War II.\n\nAbstract expressionism exploded onto the scene in the 1950s, drawing inspiration from calligraphy.\n\nIsamu Noguchi was one of the most important American sculptors of the 20th century. Born in Los Angeles to a Japanese poet father and American writer mother, he spent most of his childhood in Japan, and his drew both from traditional Japanese aesthetics and international modernism. He worked many mediums, including clay, wood, and stainless steel, but is particularly associated with stone. In 1935 he began a career-long collaboration with dancer Martha Graham for whom he designed some 20 stage sets. Major works include the Unesco headquarters peace garden in Paris, the Sunken Garden for the Beinecke Library at Yale University, and the Billy Rose Sculpture Garden for the Israeli Museum in Jerusalem.\n\nGeorge Tsutakawa was a Seattle-based painter and sculptor best known for his avant-garde bronze fountain designs.

Implicit and explicit bias towards Asian Americans (AA's) leads to discrimination and thus results in an inaccurate representation and unequal employment in film, television, and society. The yellowface trend is one that is heavily impacting the employment of Asian Americans. As stated in University of San Francisco's Christina Shu Jien Chong's research journal, Yellow Facing was a go-to tactic for casting directors as early as the 1970s . Yellowface is applying makeup on a white actor or actress to make him or her appear more Asian. When a storyline cannot be changed from Asian to White, non-Asians are typically hired and then yellowface. Yellowface is a topic many believe has become obsolete, yet, in recent years, it has become more and more prominent; yet in today's society, in lieu of yellowface, casting directors are now blatantly opting for white actors and actresses over Asian American ones. The 1961 film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" received near-universal condemnation for Mickey Rooney's yellowface portrayal of I. Y. Yunioshi. More recently, in 2009, Justin Chatwin, a white actor, portrayed an anime character, Goku, in Dragonball: Evolution. In 2011, Noah Ringer, also a white actor, portrayed an Eastern Asian monk in \"The Last Airbender\". In 2013, Clifton Collins, Jr., a Mexican-American actor, portrayed a Chinese-American character, Tendo Choi, in \"Pacific Rim\". In 2015, Emma Stone, a white actress, portrayed a local Hawaiian character, Allison Ng, in \"Aloha\". The most recent account of historical yellowface was in Disney on Ice's 2015 Dare to Dream production, in which Li Shang, a Chinese general from Mulan, was cast as a white male who wore a black wig and painted slanted eyes. Other recent films that have whitewashed traditionally Asian characters include \"The Social Network\", \"Star Trek Into Darkness\", \"The Martian\", \"Doctor Strange\", \"Ghost in the Shell\", 21 (2008 film) and \"Death Note\".\n\nAsian American characters and their representation in mainstream media, especially in the film and entertainment industry, are often one-dimensional and seriously lacking in depth. East Asian Americans in the film and media industry are often fetishized and exoticized, perpetuating damaging images of asian women as either the \"dragon lady\" or \"lotus flower\" dichotomy. An example is Lucy Liu’s dragon lady character O-Ren Ishii in \"Kill Bill\", as well as Anna May Wong's character in \"Daughter of the Dragon\". According to author Kent Ono, \"Usually yellow peril discourse constructs and Asian-white dialectic emphasizing the powerful, threatening potential of Asian's and Asian Americans, while simultaneously constructing whites as vulnerable, threatened, or otherwise in danger.\" These limiting and offensive roles offered to Asian Americans further the US's exoticism and fetishism of Asian women, leading to terms such as \"yellow fever\". According to Rosalind S. Chou in her book, \"Asian American Sexual Politics: The Construction of Race, Gender, and Sexuality\", stereotypical portrayals of Asian Americans which lead to phenomenon's such as yellow fever can be particularly damaging to real life interracial relationships where she writes \"it can be difficult to distinguish genuine interest from interest resting on fabricated constructions of an othered person.\" South Asian portrayal in cinema often involve \"Karma Sutra\" type analogies or imagery, an example being white actor Mike Myers and his role as Pitka in the movie \"The Love Guru\".\n\nIn The New York Times magazine in January 1966, the term \"model minority\" was coined by sociologist William Petersen in order to describe Japanese Americans as ethnic minorities who, despite marginalization, have achieved success in the United States. While it was first used to depict Japanese Americans, it has since evolved to characterize Asian Americans in general, specifically East Asians (i.e. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) and the South Asian community.\nHowever, this concept has faced major criticism from the Asian American community. According to Asian Americans Advancing Justice – Los Angeles, \"the misperception that Asian Americans are doing fine on their own has serious policy implications...politicians won't talk about our community's needs if they assume people don't require assistance.\"\nThis stereotype is often portrayed in media, such as television and film. Characters such as George Huang in , Cristina Yang in Grey's Anatomy, and Archie Kao in are all examples of this.\nIn addition, in the second edition of her book, Unraveling the \"Model Minority\" Stereotype: Listening to Asian American Youth, Professor Stacy J. Lee argues that the ostensibly sterling stereotype was constructed to silence the charges of racial inequality and to delegitimize the protests of racial discrimination. Bob H. Suzuki also questions the validity of the stereotype, contending that it is only media hype, more myth than reality. Suzuki further argued that, deceptively flattering and favorable on the surface, the model minority stereotype is inaccurate, overgeneralized, and a liability for Asian Americans. The commendation of Asian Americans as a model minority implicitly denigrates other racial groups as well.\n\n"}

{"id": "2899086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2899086", "title": "Contemporary ballet", "text": "Contemporary ballet\n\nContemporary ballet is a genre of dance that incorporates elements of classical ballet and modern dance. It employs classical ballet technique and in many cases classical pointe technique as well, but allows greater range of movement of the upper body and is not constrained to the rigorously defined body lines and forms found in traditional, classical ballet. Many of its attributes come from the ideas and innovations of 20th-century modern dance, including floor work and turn-in of the legs.\n\nGeorge Balanchine is often considered to have been the first pioneer of contemporary ballet. However, the true origin of contemporary ballet is credited to Russian art producer Serge Diaghilev. Diaghilev wanted to bring an understanding of the arts to the general public. He created a program that combined all forms of the arts (painting, music, theater, and art) to present to the public. When this program had success in Russia, Diaghilev was inspired to bring it to a European audience by creating a new spin on classical ballet. He created Diaghilev's Russian Ballet Company, debuting the first show in 1909. However, Diaghilev was not a choreographer, he entrusted the evolvement of his creation to several well-known choreographers, one of them being George Balanchine. \n\nThe style of dance Balanchine developed, which lies between classical ballet and today's contemporary ballet, is known by today's standards as neoclassical ballet. He used flexed hands (and occasionally feet), turned-in legs, off-centered positions and non-traditional costumes, such as leotards, tunics and \"powder puff\" tutus instead of \"pancake\" tutus, to distance his work from the classical and romantic ballet traditions. Balanchine invited modern dance performers such as Paul Taylor in to dance with his company, the New York City Ballet, and he worked with modern dance choreographer Martha Graham, which expanded his exposure to modern techniques and ideas. During this period, other choreographers such as John Butler and Glen Tetley began to consciously combine ballet and modern techniques in experimentation.\n\nOne dancer who trained with Balanchine and absorbed much of this neoclassical style was Mikhail Baryshnikov. Following Baryshnikov's appointment as artistic director of the American Ballet Theatre in 1980, he worked with various modern choreographers, most notably Twyla Tharp. Tharp choreographed \"Push Comes To Shove\" for ABT and Baryshnikov in 1976; in 1986 she created \"In The Upper Room\" for her own company. Both of these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the use of pointe shoes and classically trained dancers—for their use of contemporary ballet.\n\nTharp also worked with The Joffrey Ballet, founded in 1957 by Robert Joffrey. She choreographed \"Deuce Coupe\" for them in 1973, using pop music and a blend of modern and ballet techniques. The Joffrey Ballet continued to perform numerous contemporary pieces, many choreographed by co-founder Gerald Arpino.\n\nOther notable contemporary choreographers include Jorma Elo, William Forsythe (choreographer), Mark Morris (choreographer), Jiri Kylian, Alonzo King, and Trey McIntyre.\n\nContemporary ballet draws from both modern dance and classical ballet for its training methods and technique. For a dancer to be able to embody various styles the training regimen has become more diverse. In addition to classical technique, which often includes the signature speed and style of George Balanchine for American dancers, dancers study modern as well. In addition, many dancers do various forms of cross training. Pilates and yoga are often included to loosen muscles and align the body. Since the late 1920s, Pilates has been a popular form of cross training to help prevent injury, but increasingly, the Gyrotonic Expansion System is being utilized. With contemporary work, dancers' spines need to be more supple and they need to understand how to be grounded. This is in contrast to classical and neoclassical ballet where the dancers are required to \"pull up\" and the upper body is held. Dancers are required to first obtain classical ballet training in order to build on it with more modern technique in order to be more versatile. Despite formal training, dancers are often affected by ankle injuries, due to the high intensity footwork.\n\nThe costumes and footwear differ from any other style of dance as well. In contemporary ballet, dancers can be asked to wear pointe shoes, regular ballet shoes, or even no shoes at all. The same versatile approach goes for the music, setting, and costumes. Contemporary ballet does not require certain standards to be met. While it has more guidelines that modern dance, it does not conform to the limits of classical ballet. Classical ballet requires tutus, pointe shoes and scenery. Contemporary ballet uses different types of costumes, ranging from traditional to more modern tunic type versions. The music choices may vary as well. In Classical ballet, most often the choreography is done to classical music. In contemporary ballet, the music can range from the traditional classical music to popular music of today.\n\nToday there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers all over the world. Notable companies include Nederlands Dans Theater, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, Complexions Contemporary Ballet, and Alonzo King LINES Ballet. Likewise, many traditionally \"classical\" companies also regularly perform contemporary works. Most classically trained dancers who may identify as professional ballet dancers are in fact required to be very versatile and able to perform work ranging from classical to neoclassical to contemporary ballet to modern dance. They are required to have impeccable ballet technique with a mastery of pointe technique for women, but at the same time, are being asked to be just as comfortable in ballet slippers or bare foot performing the work of modern choreographers such as Paul Taylor (choreographer) or embracing Gaga (dance vocabulary) in the work of Ohad Naharin. It is very common for ballet companies to have an official choreographer in residence to create new work—often contemporary—on the company. As well, many contemporary choreographers are commissioned to go to companies to create new work or a company will pay for the rights to perform already existing work and an official repetiteur will come to stage it. Twyla Tharp, as previously mentioned, is a highly renowned choreographer whose work is widely performed.\n\n"}

Many 20th century authors entered into the debate, often sharing their ideas in their own fiction and non-fiction writings.\n\nThe novel was well-defined by the 19th century. In the 20th century, however, many writers began to rebel against the traditional structures imposed by this form. This reaction against the novel caused some literary theorists to question the relevancy of the novel and even to predict its 'death.'\n\nSome of the earliest proponents of the \"death of the novel\" were José Ortega y Gasset, who wrote his \"Decline of the Novel\" in 1925 and Walter Benjamin in his 1930 review \"Krisis des Romans\" (Crisis of the Novel).\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, contributors to the discussion included Gore Vidal, Roland Barthes, and John Barth. Ronald Sukenick wrote the story \"The Death of the Novel\" in 1969. In 1954, Wolfgang Kayser argued that the death of the narrator would lead to the death of the novel - a view that has since been contested by many people.\n\nMeanwhile, Alain Robbe-Grillet argued that the novel would be likely to atrophy and die as a literary form if it did not advance beyond 19th century structures; this admonition led to his creation of the New Novel or Nouveau roman.\n\nTom Wolfe in the 1970s predicted that the New Journalism would displace the novel. Italo Calvino is considered to have turned round the question \"is the novel dead?\", as \"is it possible to tell stories that are not novels?\"\n\nAs for causes, Robert B. Pippin connects the 'death of the novel' with the rise of nihilism in European culture. Saul Bellow, discussing \"Ravelstein\" which was loosely a portrait of Allan Bloom, commented on a connection to the idea that \"they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about\".\n\nOn the other hand, David Foster Wallace connected the 'death of the novel' with the mortality of the post-war generation of American novelists.\n\nWill Self discussed the idea of the death of the novel, as a microcosm of the wider debate about the death of the book itself, in relation to the transition from a Gutenberg era of printing to the post-Gutenberg era of the information age. He has even questioned the longevity of the bookshelf, let alone the book.\n\nTechnological change is often identified as a major possible cause. Anxieties about the disappearance of the book, as well as the novel, have been common throughout the 20th century. Henry Kannberg sees the post-Gutenberg age as being one where the entire morphology of literature may transform as a result of 'hyper-literacy' and the exponential abundance of texts. He argues that there may be a rebirth of the novel, or the birth of a descendant to it. Similar observations were made by Marcus du Sautoy who argued that technology allows for changes to books and novel-writing that are only just beginning to be explored.\n\nContemporary scholars such as Kathleen Fitzpatrick argue that claims of the novel's death were highly exaggerated, and that such claims often reflect anxiety about changes in the twentieth-century media landscape, as well as more submerged anxieties about social changes within the United States itself.\n\nFor Salman Rushdie, the postwar notion of the 'death of the novel' is one that has tended to exhibit certain First World assumptions based on imperialistic nostalgia.\n\n\n"}

These paintings were sometimes made as pairs with one showing the view by day and the other by moonlight. Wright admitted that he had not observed this scene directly, \"Moon lights & fire lights are but a sort of work with me for I cant with impunity go out at night and study the former, & the latter I have seen but once, and at a time too, when I thought not of painting such effects.\"\n\nDovedale is a very popular dale in Staffordshire and Wright's home county of Derbyshire. Admired in Wright's time, it has been owned by the National Trust since 1924 and made available to the many Peak District visitors. Dovedale is named for the River Dove and it is long.\n\nWright's paintings appear to be from nature, but in a letter of 1787 he said that he had observed moonlight and firelight only once at night and this was some time before he decided to create this series of paintings. However his preparatory sketches show that he was using a mixture of studies and chance. The unusual reversal of light and shade in the trees in the sketch of Dovedale is said to be after using techniques created by the Russian born Alexander Cozens. Wright owned paintings by Cozens who taught his students to paint landscapes. He told them to create blots on paper and then use these as inspiration for the composition.\n\nThere are no known Derbyshire landscapes by Wright that are dateable before 1786. One of the problems is that many of Wright's paintings are dated by consulting Wright's accounts in his notebook. In the case of his English landscapes this has proved challenging. It is known that some of the Dovedale pictures are some of his earliest English landscapes.\nWright frequently repeated a popular subject in his paintings as he did with his Virgil's Tomb pictures and his Blacksmith's Shop paintings. In this case he made five very similar paintings. The version at Oberlin College was painted in 1785 to 1786 and sold to Edward Mundy of Shipley Hall. The college obtained it in 1951. There is a matching painting to this which is a similar view but in daylight. That painting is still in Derbyshire at Parwich Hall which is in a small village close to Dovedale.\nWright also did a daylight view of Dovedale in 1787 which he gave to the industrialist Josiah Wedgwood out of respect for his patronage on the arts. This painting is now in the Wedgwood Museum.\nTwo other paintings of Dovedale were sold to Sir Brooke Boothby bt. of Ashbourne Hall, who had helped Wright when he put on the first one-man exhibition in London. Boothby also purchased two views of nearby Matlock, two paintings of bridges in Rome as well as an unusual 1781 portrait of himself lying by a brook holding a book by Rousseau.\n"}

It illustrates the poem \"Echo and Narcissus\" from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\".\n\nJohn William Waterhouse (1847–1917) was an English painter who, because of his style and themes, has been classified as a Pre-Raphaelite, but is more accurately described as a Neo-Classical painter. He painted over 200 works, mainly in the genres of classical mythology, and of historical or literary subjects. One of his common themes is the \"femme fatale\", the woman who ensnares a man.\n\n\"Echo and Narcissus\" is in the genre of classical mythology. In Ovid's version of the myth, Narcissus was the son of the river god Cephissus and the nymph Liriope. His parents were told that he would live to an old age if he did not look at himself. He rejected all the nymphs and women who fell in love with him. One of these was the nymph Echo, who was so upset by her rejection that she withdrew from life and wasted away until all that was left was a whisper. Her prayers were heard by the goddess Nemesis who caused Narcissus to fall in love with his own reflection. He continued to look at his reflection until he died. A \"narcissus\" flower grew on the spot where he died.\n\nThe painting is in oil on canvas and measures by .

Significantly, Eclecticism hardly ever constituted a specific style in art: it is characterized by the fact that it was not a particular style. In general, the term describes the combination in a single work of a variety of influences—mainly of elements from different historical styles in architecture, painting, and the graphic and decorative arts. In music the term used may be either eclecticism or polystylism.\n\nThe term eclectic was first used by Johann Joachim Winckelmann to characterize the art of the Carracci, who incorporated in their paintings elements from the Renaissance and classical traditions. Indeed, Agostino, Annibale and Lodovico Carracci had tried to combine in their art Michelangelo's line, Titian's color, Correggio's chiaroscuro, and Raphael's symmetry and grace. \n\nIn the 18th century, Sir Joshua Reynolds, head of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, was one of the most influential advocates of eclecticism. In the sixth of his famous academical \"Discourses\" (1774), he wrote that the painter may use the work of the ancients as a \"magazine of common property, always open to the public, whence every man has a right to take what materials he pleases\" .\n\nEarly examples of eclectic architecture were built in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, particularly in the Palazzina Cinese in Palermo..\nEclecticism \"was an important concept in Western architecture during the mid- and late 19th century, and it reappeared in a new guise in the latter part of the 20th century\" .\n\n"}

In 2016 Edinburgh ranked 3rd in the country for Architecture according to the Complete University Guide.\n\nIn 1907, Edinburgh College of Art was established under the control of Scottish Education Department, after approvement of major reorganisation of Edinburgh higher art education. At the time, Edinburgh College of Art was divided into four schools: Drawing and Painting, Design and Crafts, Architecture, and Sculpture. The establishment of the new School of Architecture was initially aimed for the training of architects and artists, which was supported by public subscriptions and foundations. First architecture courses were taught in 1908, in which it experienced numerous changes in teaching staff, structure, syllabus, and its role in the education of architects, in the period from 1908 until 1968. The first Head of the School of Architecture within Edinburgh College of Art was John Watson, appointed in 1908. Meanwhile, The Forbes Chair of Architecture, which was a joint post with Edinburgh College of Art, was established in 1947, in which Raymond Gordon Brown was the holder of the title as well as the Head of School of Architecture within the University of Edinburgh.

{"id": "11491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11491", "title": "Fable", "text": "Fable\n\nFable is a literary genre: a succinct fictional story, in prose or verse, that features animals, legendary creatures, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that are anthropomorphized (given human qualities, such as the ability to speak human language) and that illustrates or leads to a particular moral lesson (a \"moral\"), which may at the end be added explicitly as a pithy maxim or saying.\n\nA fable differs from a parable in that the latter \"excludes\" animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as actors that assume speech or other powers of humankind.\n\nUsage has not always been so clearly distinguished. In the King James Version of the New Testament, \" (\"mythos\"\") was rendered by the translators as \"fable\" in the First Epistle to Timothy, the Second Epistle to Timothy, the Epistle to Titus and the First Epistle of Peter.\n\nA person who writes fables is a fabulist.\n\nThe fable is one of the most enduring forms of folk literature, spread abroad, modern researchers agree, less by literary anthologies than by oral transmission. Fables can be found in the literature of almost every country.\n\nThe varying corpus denoted \"Aesopica\" or \"Aesop's Fables\" includes most of the best-known western fables, which are attributed to the legendary Aesop, supposed to have been a slave in ancient Greece around 550 BCE. When Babrius set down fables from the \"Aesopica\" in verse for a Hellenistic Prince \"Alexander,\" he expressly stated at the head of Book II that this type of \"myth\" that Aesop had introduced to the \"sons of the Hellenes\" had been an invention of \"Syrians\" from the time of \"Ninos\" (personifying Nineveh to Greeks) and Belos (\"ruler\"). Epicharmus of Kos and Phormis are reported as having been among the first to invent comic fables. Many familiar fables of Aesop include \"The Crow and the Pitcher\", \"The Tortoise and the Hare\" and \"The Lion and the Mouse\". In ancient Greek and Roman education, the fable was the first of the \"progymnasmata\"—training exercises in prose composition and public speaking—wherein students would be asked to learn fables, expand upon them, invent their own, and finally use them as persuasive examples in longer forensic or deliberative speeches. The need of instructors to teach, and students to learn, a wide range of fables as material for their declamations resulted in their being gathered together in collections, like those of Aesop.\n\nAfrican oral culture has a rich story-telling tradition. As they have for thousands of years, people of all ages in Africa continue to interact with nature, including plants, animals and earthly structures such as rivers, plains, and mountains. Grandparents enjoy enormous respect in African societies and fill the new role of story-telling during retirement years. Children and, to some extent, adults are mesmerized by good story-tellers when they become animated in their quest to tell a good fable.\n\nJoel Chandler Harris wrote African-American fables in the Southern context of slavery under the name of Uncle Remus. His stories of the animal characters Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and Brer Bear are modern examples of African-American story-telling, this though should not transcend critiques and controversies as to whether or not Uncle Remus was a racist or apologist for slavery. The Disney movie \"Song of the South\" introduced many of the stories to the public and others not familiar with the role that storytelling played in the life of cultures and groups without training in speaking, reading, writing, or the cultures to which they had been relocated to from world practices of capturing Africans and other indigenous populations to provide slave labor to colonized countries.\n\nIndia has a rich tradition of fabulous novels, mostly explainable by the fact that the culture derives traditions and learns qualities from natural elements. Most of the gods are some form of animals with ideal qualities. Also, hundreds of fables were composed in ancient India during the first millennium BCE, often as stories within frame stories. Indian fables have a mixed cast of humans and animals. The dialogues are often longer than in fables of Aesop and often witty as the animals try to outwit one another by trickery and deceit. In Indian fables, man is not superior to the animals. The tales are often comical. The Indian fable adhered to the universally known traditions of the fable. The best examples of the fable in India are the Panchatantra and the Jataka tales. These included Vishnu Sarma's \"Panchatantra\", the \"Hitopadesha\", \"Vikram and The Vampire\", and Syntipas' \"Seven Wise Masters\", which were collections of fables that were later influential throughout the Old World. Ben E. Perry (compiler of the \"Perry Index\" of Aesop's fables) has argued controversially that some of the Buddhist \"Jataka tales\" and some of the fables in the \"Panchatantra\" may have been influenced by similar Greek and Near Eastern ones. Earlier Indian epics such as Vyasa's \"Mahabharata\" and Valmiki's \"Ramayana\" also contained fables within the main story, often as side stories or back-story. The most famous folk stories from the Near East were the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", also known as the \"Arabian Nights\".\n\nFables had a further long tradition through the Middle Ages, and became part of European high literature. During the 17th century, the French fabulist Jean de La Fontaine (1621–1695) saw the soul of the fable in the moral — a rule of behavior. Starting with the Aesopian pattern, La Fontaine set out to satirize the court, the church, the rising bourgeoisie, indeed the entire human scene of his time. La Fontaine's model was subsequently emulated by England's John Gay (1685–1732); Poland's Ignacy Krasicki (1735–1801); Italy's (1739–1812) and (1754–1827); Serbia's Dositej Obradović (1739–1811); Spain's Félix María de Samaniego (1745–1801) and Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa (1750–1791); France's Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian (1755–94); and Russia's Ivan Krylov (1769–1844).\n\nIn modern times, while the fable has been trivialized in children's books, it has also been fully adapted to modern adult literature. Felix Salten's \"Bambi\" (1923) is a \"Bildungsroman\" — a story of a protagonist's coming-of-age — cast in the form of a fable. James Thurber used the ancient fable style in his books \"Fables for Our Time\" (1940) and \"Further Fables for Our Time\" (1956), and in his stories \"The Princess and the Tin Box\" in \"The Beast in Me and Other Animals\" (1948) and \"The Last Clock: A Fable for the Time, Such As It Is, of Man\" in \"Lanterns and Lances\" (1961). Władysław Reymont's \"The Revolt\" (1922), a metaphor for the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, described a revolt by animals that take over their farm in order to introduce \"equality.\" George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" (1945) similarly satirized Stalinist Communism in particular, and totalitarianism in general, in the guise of animal fable.\n\nIn the 21st century, the Neapolitan writer Sabatino Scia is the author of more than two hundred fables that he describes as “western protest fables.” The characters are not only animals, but also things, beings, and elements from nature. Scia’s aim is the same as in the traditional fable, playing the role of revealer of human society. In Latin America, the brothers Juan and Victor Ataucuri Garcia have contributed to the resurgence of the fable. But they do so with a novel idea: use the fable as a means of dissemination of traditional literature of that place. In the book \"\"Fábulas Peruanas\" published in 2003, they have collected myths, legends, beliefs of Andean and Amazonian Peru, to write as fables. The result has been an extraordinary work rich in regional nuances. Here we discover the relationship between man and his origin, with nature, with its history, its customs and beliefs then become norms and values.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Greenstone artefacts may be made of greenschist, chlorastrolite, serpentine, omphacite, chrysoprase, olivine, nephrite, chloromelanite among other green-hued minerals. The term also includes jade and jadeite, although these are perhaps more frequently identified by these latter terms. The greenish hue of these rocks generally derives from the presence of minerals such as chlorite, hornblende, or epidote.\n\nGreenstone minerals were presumably selected for their color rather than their chemical composition. In archaeology therefore, having a loosely applied general term is at least partially influenced by the observation that ancient cultures often used and considered these various green-hued materials as interchangeable. Greenstone objects are often found very considerable distances from the source of the rock, indicating early travel or trading networks. A polished jadeite axe head in the British Museum (4000-2000 BCE) was found in Canterbury, Kent but uses stone from the Alps of Northern Italy, and objects from other parts of the world had travelled comparable distances to their findspots.\n\nAncient China and Mesoamerica have especial reputations for the prevalence and significance of greenstone (particularly jade) usage. Greenstones also figure prominently in the indigenous cultures of southeastern Australia, and among the Māori of New Zealand (who knew greenstone as \"pounamu\"). Neolithic Europe also used greenstone, especially for prestige versions of axe tools, not made for use; comparable jade versions of tools and weapons also appeared in the Olmec and other Pre-Columbian cultures and in early Chinese civilization.\n\n"}
{"id": "48167905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48167905", "title": "Haerlempjes", "text": "Haerlempjes\n\nHaerlempjes refer to a specific genre of landscape painting that includes a view of Haarlem (formerly spelled \"Haerlem\"). It is used most often to refer to Jacob van Ruisdael's panoramic views of the city, but the term is derived from mentions in Haarlem archives as a type of painting included in household inventories. The diminutive suffix \"pje\" would denote a small, cabinet-sized painting, but even the largest landscapes may be referred to as \"Haerlempjes\" today.\nIn his biography of Albert van Ouwater, Karel van Mander claimed that \"It is said from the mouths of the oldest painters, that landscape painting originated in Haarlem\". Van Mander was writing in 1604 for his Haarlem-sponsored Schilder-boeck, and his was one of many initiatives to rebuild the city and glorify its history. After his book was published, the city attracted several landscape painters in the 1620s, including Esaias van de Velde, Jan van Goyen and the Ruisdael brothers Salomon and Isaack.\n\nHaarlem is a bustling city today that makes up part of the Randstad area of the Netherlands, so it helps when looking at these old paintings to orient oneself according to old maps.\n\nHobbyists love to look at older Haarlem cityscapes and pick out features such as steeples and boats. For paintings traditionally called Haerlempjes, such features have been proven to be based more on historical accuracy rather than artist fantasy. Though fantasy cityscapes were popular in the Netherlands throughout the 17th-century, these seem to be more often pastiches of southern harbours or italianate landscapes, rather than places that artists had conceivably visited. Today, for example, it is assumed that Jacob van Ruisdael worked in Bentheim because he painted many accurate views of the castle there. However, he often painted such castle views situated in a fantasy landscape on a mountain top, though the castle is in fact situated in low rolling countryside. In Haarlem, though he painted many \"dunescapes\" of the Kennemerland area, he never turned those dunes into mountains.\nMost travellers visiting Haarlem in the middle of the 17th-century were on their way from The Hague to Amsterdam and saw the city from the Spaarne river, as most intercity travel was by trekschuit or sailing ship. Thus many early cityscapes are taken from the point of view of the river traveller.\n\nThe popularity of such river-based cityscapes were offset by another type of landscape with dunes or windmills that included a Haarlem cityscape on the horizon.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1650s that the production of the panoramic views began that were later copied by others. Perhaps the most famous is Ruisdael's view of Haarlem bleaching fields from the north-east, which is why many assumed that all Haerlempjes were painted from the same perspective, not realizing that the entire area is relatively flat and so they were painted from an imaginary point somewhere up in the air, and not from a mountaintop. There is a high dune in Bloemendaal called \"Het Kopje\" and there used to be a ridge of high dunes in Heemstede that were later slowly removed by sand-barges for use in building foundations for the mansions in the Amsterdam expansion known today as the Canals of Amsterdam. On older maps, the \"Sant-vaert\" is clearly marked where such barges once travelled. That canal still exists today and forms the modern border between Haarlem and Heemstede, and is called the \"Crayenestervaart\".\n\nIn 1997 Pieter Biesboer wrote a short article explaining the viewpoints of some of these paintings based on old maps, most notably the \"Bleaching Fields to the North-Northeast of Haarlem\" in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. This painting, despite its title, does not show Haarlem from the north at all, but shows Haarlem from the south, from an imaginary point somewhere above the old dune ridge near the street known as the \"Blekersvaart\" in Heemstede, probably close to the \"Dorstige Kuil\", an inn favored by artists in the 17th century. The church in the painting clearly shows the curved side of the choir on the right rather than the left. Biesboer noticed also that this painting displays many more trees, which is logical because the park Haarlemmerhout is situated there.\n\nIn the same article a few other paintings are mentioned, including a Ruisdael view of Haarlem bleaching fields in the collection of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, which shows the ruins of Huis ter Kleef, also shown from the same perspective in a painting in the musée Jacquemart-André. He was able to trace the bleachery \"Clercq and Beeck\" situated on the Kleverlaan shown in the right foreground in this painting to one owned by Lucas de Clercq, whose portrait was painted by Frans Hals. This scene of Clercq and Beeck was painted again by Ruisdael with some more detail in the version located in the Mauritshuis.\n\nThe painting from the Mauritshuis is the same view of Beeck and Clercq as the painting in the Rijksmuseum, while the one in the Gemäldegalerie of the same general view seems between those and the one in Montreal:\n\nThe painting from the Philadelphia Museum is the same view from Heemstede as the painting in the Timken Museum of Art:\nThough not all of these panoramic paintings show bleachfields, these bleacheries were often also mentioned on maps, and served as easy points of orientation for those looking down on the landscape from high dunes. Possibly some of these paintings were commissioned by the bleacheries themselves for use in Haarlem shops where goods were sold and exchanged. Lucas de Clercq lived in Haarlem during the winter and on his Clercq and Beeck estate in the summer months. Even Rembrandt made a sketch of bleaching fields, though these were only identified as such a few centuries after the fact.\n\nThe \"Haerlempjes\" seemed to become popular not only in Haarlem, but were sold everywhere, and even various books were produced containing prints of such views of Haarlem by the Roghman family and others.\n\n"}
{"id": "2889403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2889403", "title": "Heroic realism", "text": "Heroic realism\n\nHeroic realism is art used as propaganda. Examples include the Socialist realism style associated with Communist regimes, and sometimes the similar art style associated with Fascism. Its characteristics are realism and the depiction of figures as ideal types or symbols, often with explicit rejection of modernism in art (as \"bourgeois\" or \"degenerate\").\n\nBoth socialist art and Nazi art were explicitly ordered to be heroic, and were in consequence ideal rather than realistic.\n\nHeroic realism designs were used to propagate the revolution in the Soviet Union during Lenin's time. Lenin doubted that the illiterate population would understand what abstract visual images were intended to communicate. He also thought that artists, such as constructivists and productivists, may have had a hidden agenda against the government. Movements such as Cubism were denounced as bourgeois and criticized for its failure to draw on the heritage of art and for rejecting the beautiful on the grounds that it was \"old\", whereas proletarian culture had to draw on what was learned in the prior times. The artists countered such thinking, however, by saying that the advanced art represented the advanced political ideas.\n\nIn literature, Maxim Gorky urged that one obtained realism by extracting the basic idea from reality, but by adding the potential and desirable to it, one added romantism with deep revolutionary potential.\n\nStalin understood the powerful message which could be sent through images to a primarily illiterate population. Once he was in power, posters quickly became the new medium for educating illiterate peasants on daily life—from bathing, to farming, the posters provided visual instruction on almost everything. In 1931-2, the early emphasis on the \"little man\" and the anonymous laboring masses gave way to the \"hero of labor\", derived from the people but set apart by the scale of his deeds. As a consequence, literature filled with \"positive heroes\" that were sometimes tedious.\n\nIn 1934, a new doctrine called Socialist realism came about. This new movement rejected the \"bourgeois influence on art\" and replaced it with appreciation for figurative painting, photography and new typography layouts. Writers were explicitly enjoined to develop \"heroization.\" At the Paris World Fair, Vera Mukhina's \"Worker and Kolkhoz Woman\" exemplified the ideal New Soviet Man, depicting a man and woman in working clothes, with his hammer and her sickle crossed, in a monumental statue with both striding forward.\n\nWhen Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, modern art was condemned as degenerate, and largely prohibited. The Nazis promoted a style of art based on classical models, intended to nurture nationalism. Heroic realism was to inculcate values of sacrifice, duty, and devotion. The heroic man, who was bound to blood and soil, acted rather than thought and sacrificed himself. This particularly favored the heroic death.\n\nNazi theory explicitly rejected \"materialism\", and therefore, despite the realistic treatment of images, \"realism\" was a seldom used term. A painter was to create an ideal picture, for eternity. The images of men, and still more of women, were heavily stereotyped, with physical perfection required for the nude paintings. In painting, peasants were popular images, reflecting a simple life in harmony with nature. \nSculpture's monumental possibilities gave it a better expression of Nazi racial theories. The most common image was of the nude male, expressing the ideal of the Aryan race. Arno Breker's skill at this type made him Hitler's favorite sculptor. Nude females were also common, though they tended to be less monumental. In both cases, the physical form was to show no imperfections. At the Paris Exposition of 1937, Josef Thorak's \"Comradeship\" stood outside the German pavilion, depicting two enormous nude males, clasping hands and standing defiantly side by side, in a pose of defense and racial camaraderie.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1007213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1007213", "title": "Indian classical dance", "text": "Indian classical dance\n\nIndian classical dance, or Shastriya Nritya, is an umbrella term for various performance arts rooted in religious Hindu musical theatre styles, whose theory and practice can be traced to the Sanskrit text \"Natya Shastra\".\n\nThe number of recognized classical dances range from eight to more, depending on the source and scholar. The Sangeet Natak Akademi recognizes eight – Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi, Odissi, Kathakali, Sattriya, Manipuri and Mohiniyattam. Scholars such as Drid Williams add Chhau, Yakshagana and Bhagavata Mela to the list. The Culture Ministry of the Government of India includes Chhau in its classical list. These dances are traditionally regional, all of them include music and recitation in local language or Sanskrit, and they represent a unity of core ideas in a diversity of styles, costumes and expression. Indian classical dance is made from India and classical dance is played by various actors.\n\nThe \"Natya Shastra\" is the foundational treatise for classical dances of India, and this text is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni. Its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE. The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures – all of which are part of Indian classical dances. Dance and performance arts, states this ancient text, are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures.\nWhile the \"Natya Shastra\" is the revered ancient text in the Hindu tradition, there are numerous other ancient and medieval Sanskrit dance-drama related texts that further discuss and expand on the classical repertoire of performance arts, such as the \"Abhinaya Darpana\", \"Abhinaba Bharati\", \"Natya Darpana\", \"Bhava Prakasa\" and many others. The term \"classical\" (Sanskrit: \"Shastriya\") denotes the Natya Shastra-based performing arts.\n\nThe text Natya Shastra describes religious arts as a form as \"margi\", or a \"spiritual traditional path\" that liberates the soul, while the folk entertainment is called \"desi\", or a \"regional popular practice\".\n\nIndian classical dances are traditionally performed as an expressive drama-dance form of religious performance art, related to Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, pan-Hindu Epics and the Vedic literature, or a folksy entertainment that includes story-telling from Sanskrit or regional language plays. As a religious art, they are either performed inside the sanctum of a Hindu temple, or near it. Folksy entertainment may also be performed in temple grounds or any fairground, typically in a rural setting by traveling troupes of artists; alternatively, they have been performed inside the halls of royal courts or public squares during festivals.\n\nThe Natya Shastra mentions four \"Pravrittis\" (traditions, genres) of ancient dance-drama in vogue when it was composed – \"Avanti\" (Ujjain, central), \"Dakshinatya\" (south), \"Panchali\" (north, west) and \"Odra-Magadhi\" (Odisha-Bihar-Bengal, east).\n\nSources differ in their list of Indian classical dance forms. Encyclopædia Britannica mentions six dances. The Sangeet Natak Akademi has given recognition to nine Indian dances. The Indian government's Ministry of Culture includes eleven dance forms. Scholars such as Drid Williams and others include Chhau, Yaksagana and Bhagavata Mela to the eight classical Indian dances in the Sangeet Natak Akademi list.\n\nThe classical dance forms recognised by the Sangeet Natak Akademi and the Ministry of Culture are:\n\nAll major classical Indian dance forms include in repertoire, three categories of performance in the \"Natya Shastra\". These are \"Nritta\", \"Nritya\" and \"Natya\":\n\n\nAll classical dances of India used similar symbolism and rules of gestures in \"abhinaya\" (acting). The roots of \"abhinaya\" are found in the \"Natyashastra\" text which defines drama in verse 6.10 as that which aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor's art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a super sensual inner state of being. A performance art, asserts \"Natyashastra\", connects the artists and the audience through \"abhinaya\" (literally, \"carrying to the spectators\"), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music. Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art to engage every aspect of life, in order to glorify and gift a state of joyful consciousness.\n\nThe communication through symbols is in the form of expressive gestures (mudras or hastas) and pantomime set to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the \"ras\" (sentiment, emotional taste) and \"bhava\" (mood) of the underlying story. In Hindu classical dances, the artist successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2841648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2841648", "title": "Locus amoenus", "text": "Locus amoenus\n\nLocus amoenus (Latin for \"pleasant place\") is a literary topos involving an idealized place of safety or comfort. A \"locus amoenus\" is usually a beautiful, shady lawn or open woodland, or a group of idyllic islands, sometimes with connotations of Eden or Elysium.\n\nErnst Robert Curtius wrote the concept's definitive formulation in his \"European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages\" (1953).\n\nA \"locus amoenus\" will have three basic elements: trees, grass, and water. Often, the garden will be in a remote place and function as a landscape of the mind. It can also be used to highlight the differences between urban and rural life or be a place of refuge from the processes of time and mortality. \n\nIn some works, such gardens also have overtones of the regenerative powers of human sexuality marked out by flowers, springtime, and goddesses of love and fertility.\n\nThe literary use of this type of setting goes back, in Western literature at least, to Homer, and it became a staple of the pastoral works of poets such as Theocritus and Virgil. Horace (\"Ars poetica\", 17) and the commentators on Virgil, such as Servius, recognize that descriptions of \"loci amoeni\" have become a rhetorical commonplace.\n\nIn Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", the function of the \"locus amoenus\" is inverted, to form the \"locus terribilis\". Instead of offering a respite from dangers, it is itself usually the scene of violent encounters.\n\nThe Middle Ages merged the classical \"locus amoenus\" with biblical imagery, as from the Song of Songs.\n\nMatthew of Vendôme provided multiple accounts of how to describe the \"locus amoenus\", while Dante drew on the commonplace for his description of the Earthly Paradise: \"Here spring is endless, here all fruits are.\"\n\nThe \"locus amoenus\" was a popular theme in the works of such Renaissance figures as Ariosto and Tasso.\n\nShakespeare made good use of the \"locus amoenus\" in his long poem \"Venus and Adonis\". The trope also fed into his construction, in many plays, of what Northrop Frye has called the Shakespearean \"green world\" – a space that lies outside of city limits, a liminal space where erotic passions can be freely explored, away from civilization and the social order – such as the Forest of Arden in \"As You Like It\". A mysterious and dark, feminine place, as opposed to the rigid masculine civil structure, the green world can also be found featured in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and \"Titus Andronicus\".\n\nIn the 20th century the \"locus amoenus\" appears in the work of T. S. Eliot, as in the Rose Garden of \"Burnt Norton\" and in J. R. R. Tolkien's Shire and Lothlórien.\n\nThe split-off obverse of the \"locus amoenus\" is the apparently delectable but in fact treacherous garden, often linked to a malign sexuality, as in Circe's palace or the Bower of Bliss in Edmund Spenser's \"Faerie Queene\".\n\n"}
{"id": "4477878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4477878", "title": "Lou Beale", "text": "Lou Beale\n\nLou Beale is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\", played by Anna Wing. She made her first on-screen appearance on 19 February 1985 and departed on 26 July 1988, when the character was killed off. The character is played by Karen Meagher in the 1988 \"EastEnders\" special, \"CivvyStreet\", set during the Second World War. She appeared in 232 episodes.\n\nLou Beale was the first \"EastEnders\" character to be created by series co-creator Tony Holland, taking the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background.\n\nLou is the archetypal East End matriarch throughout \"EastEnders\"' first three years. An intimidating force within the local community, she is the dowager of Albert Square's central family, the Beales and Fowlers. Never afraid to speak her mind, and woe betide anyone who manages to get on her wrong side, Lou has the respect of her friends and family, even if they do find her a bit of a nuisance at times.\n\nBorn in the East End at the outbreak of World War I, Lou lived in Walford all her life. She was born into a large working-class East End family, the youngest of seven siblings, and grew up with a strong sense of community spirit. In the 1930s, she fell in love with a local boy, Albert Beale (Gary Olson), and gave birth to his daughter, Maggie (Olivia Shanley), but had her adopted because she was born out of wedlock. By 1936, Lou and Albert had married and in 1938 moved to 45 Albert Square. They had six more children: Harry (Aaron Mason), Ronnie (Chase Marks), Dora, Kenny (Michael Attwell), and twins Pete (Peter Dean) and Pauline (Wendy Richard). Albert died in 1965, and Lou remained in the same house with Pauline and her husband, Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher). Lou regularly intervened in her family's affairs, especially when she disapproved of Pete's relationship with Kathy Hills (Gillian Taylforth) because he had previously divorced his first wife, Pat (Pam St Clement), and she had banished her son Kenny to New Zealand in the 1960s for having an affair with Pat. Lou then watched her grandchildren Michelle (Susan Tully), Mark (David Scarboro/Todd Carty) and Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) grow up, with Pauline, Pete, Arthur and Kathy looking after her in her old age. In one episode she claims she was one of seven children, one boy and six girls, and on Christmas Day 1987, she states she is from a family of eight, five boys and three girls.\n\nLou's affinity and ties with the area mean that she tends to view Albert Square as her own and thinks that gives her an excuse to intrude into people's business as she sees fit. She is great friends with Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), her lifelong neighbours. She also has a good relationship with the local general practitioner, Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton) and an old Jewish pawnbroker known only as 'Uncle' (Leonard Maguire).\n\nLou has a tempestuous relationship with her children-in-law Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) and Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), blaming Kathy for Pete's first divorce (something Lou regards as unnatural, despite her fervent dislike of Pat), and showing displeasure at Arthur's unemployment; nothing he does is ever good enough for her daughter Pauline. In February 1985, she is furious to discover that Pauline is pregnant for the third time, her family already financially crippled by Arthur's long stint of unemployment. Lou gives Pauline and Arthur the choice of an abortion, having the baby adopted or keeping the baby, but they will not be allowed to live in her house. The family try to bring her round, but she finally is won round when the family organise her a holiday in Clacton-on-Sea. Lou supports her grandson Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) choice to work in catering, which Ian's father Pete does not approve of, wanting Ian to have a more masculine career. Lou is delighted at having another grandson named Martin's (Jon Peyton Price), although she would have preferred him to be named Albert after her late husband. Her 16-year-old granddaughter Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) finds out she is pregnant and Lou, Pauline and Kathy discuss Michelle's options, settling on an abortion, but if Michelle wanted the baby, she could stay with Kathy's sister Stephanie, though Michelle is furious with them deciding for her. Lou collapses in late 1985, prompting Dr Legg to send Lou into hospital for some tests and she is diagnosed with angina. The family have to make changes within the household to accommodate Lou's health problems, such as moving her bedroom downstairs, however, Lou doesn't take well to the changes.\n\nLou has a long-standing feud with Pat, having never forgiven her for having an affair with Kenny. Lou is plagued with mixed feelings when Kenny returns to London in 1988, after banishing him from their lives twenty years before. She has always had a difficult relationship with her son, feeling him to be \"too big for the Square\" and fears that Pat's revelation, that he is the true father of Pete's son Simon (Nick Berry), will tear her beloved family apart. Before his return to New Zealand, Lou manages to make amends with her estranged son, despite Pat's malicious stirring – who later admits to Simon that Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield) is his real father after all.\n\nIn her later years, Lou is plagued with ill-health. In July 1988, she returns from a holiday in her beloved Leigh-on-Sea feeling distinctly unwell. Fearing she is dying, she takes the opportunity to announce to her nearest and dearest exactly what she thinks of them, even managing to make a truce of sorts with nemesis Pat. After gathering her clan of Beales and Fowlers around her, she has a few choice words of wisdom and encouragement for each family member. The next morning, she is discovered dead in her bed by daughter Pauline, having died peacefully in her sleep the previous night. Her friends and family mourn her death affectionately, never quite managing to forget the irreplaceable \"old bag\".\n\nThe youngest of seven siblings, Lou was from a large East End family herself. Only her sister Flo (Linda Robson) came to outlive her. In 1990, Harry Osborne (John Boswall) returns to Albert Square – he had been engaged to Lou's sister, Doris, but she married Morris Miller after Harry was presumed dead in the war. In 1993, Lou's relative Nellie Ellis (Elizabeth Kelly) comes to stay with Pauline and Arthur. In 1997, it is discovered that Lou had given birth to another daughter, also fathered by Albert, who Lou had given up for adoption because she was conceived out of wedlock. Pauline, Ian and Mark travel to Ireland later that year to reunite with their long-lost family member, Maggie. In 2001, Mark names his stepdaughter Louise Mitchell (Rachel Cox) after Lou. In 2015, Ian's grandson Louie Beale is also named after Lou.\n\nThe creators of \"EastEnders\", Tony Holland and Julia Smith, had always intended the programme to be primarily based around a large family \"in old East-end tradition\". By the 1980s, such families were on the decline in the East End. Natives had begun to emigrate out of East London to the wider area around Ilford, Romford, Chelmsford and Eastbourne. However, there were still some that refused to uproot and leave the area that had been home to many generations of their family.\n\nTo construct the focal family, Holland and Smith were helped considerably by Tony Holland's recollections of his own East End background. Lou was the first \"EastEnders\" character to be created. She was based on Holland's aunt Lou Beale, one of four sisters from a large Walthamstow family. Lou was mother to his cousins Peter and Pauline and married to Albert – a family set-up that would eventually be recreated on-screen and would go on to be forever hailed as the first family of \"EastEnders\", the Beales and Fowlers. Peter Batt, who was one of the original scriptwriters of \"EastEnders\", has stated that elements of Lou Beale were based on his mother.\n\nLou's original character outline as written by series creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, \"EastEnders: The Inside Story\":\"A lively 70 year old. Archetypal East-end mother-earth figure. Fat, funny, sometimes loud, often openly sentimental. An obsessive view of family...she can be a stubborn cruel \"old bag\" when she wants to be, sometimes keeping \"atmospheres\" going for months. It was always Lou's house that was used for the big family celebrations. Especially Christmas. Twenty or more people crammed into a tiny house. Five sisters wedged into a minuscule kitchen; drinking gin and orange; wearing funny hats; all wearing aprons; laughing raucously and trying to cook a huge dinner at the same time. Lou's house was also the meeting place for the family Sunday teas. Ham, or tinned salmon salad. Bread and butter. Jelly and tinned cream. And, tea...the changing face of the area (especially the immigrants) is a constant source of fear to her, but then she doesn't go out much. She prefers to be at home, or on a trip down memory lane: day trips to Southend – the Kursal, Rossi's ice-cream and a plate of cockles; one wonderful week's holiday in a caravan in Clacton; fruit picking in Essex; Christmas; weddings; street parties...She has a soft spot for her son, Pete...\" (page 51).\n\nThe actress Anna Wing, who was now 70 years old and had been acting since the late 1930s, auditioned for the role. She was so keen to play the part that she turned up for the audition clutching her birth certificate to prove she was a Hackney greengrocer's daughter and implored the producers to give her the job. When she first read for the part Holland and Smith felt that \"she overacted terribly\", but on the second reading she \"brought the performance down considerably\". There were initial fears over whether an actress of her age would have the stamina to survive \"EastEnders\"' gruelling schedule, but when asked if she'd like to be in a popular soap, Wing replied \"All my life I've been an actress, now I want to be a household name!\"\n\nWing was set to appear in a stage play of \"Adrian Mole\", which would have clashed with the filming of \"EastEnders\". Julia Smith refused to offer her any leeway and informed her that she had to take a gamble — she could either turn down the play, meaning that if she failed to get the part of Lou she would have lost two jobs, or she could give up the possibility of playing Lou and accept the play. Wing decided to turn down the play and she was subsequently given the role of Lou. An early choice in the casting process, Wing had the face, voice and attitude that Tony Holland had imagined for the character. She was told by producers to bring something from her own background to the role.\n\nLou's fierce demeanour made an impact from the opening episode, with one of the popular press in Britain (\"The Sun\" newspaper) running the headline \"Enter the dragon... Lou Beale!\"\n\nLou was a frightening matriarch who domineered over both the Beale and Fowler families and most of her neighbours in Walford as well. The character did have a softer side, most often seen when interacting with her grandchildren. She was depicted as the linchpin of the Walford community and was often first to rally around her neighbours in times of trouble, or instruct various members of her clan to do so in her stead.\n\nShe was a family orientated character, particularly opposed to change and determined to hold on to the ever-diminishing traditions of the East End. Most of her storylines were family based, which included various feuds, most notably with Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement), the ex-wife of her son who showed up in Walford in 1986. Various scandals and hardships were thrown at the character and her family, which she stoically battled through in order to keep the close-knit family that she presided over, together. The character was also used for comedy, most regularly with the other older characters, Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), and she had a tendency to take to her bed and feign sickness if she didn't get her own way. Her relationship with son-in-law Arthur (Bill Treacher) was another on-going sub-plot often used for comical effect — Lou portraying the stereotypical nagging mother-in-law and Arthur being the main protagonist for most of her displeasure, although they did share moments of closeness as well.\n\nHowever, in 1988 Anna Wing began to grow disillusioned with the direction the show was going in. She felt \"EastEnders\" did not fit in with her beliefs as a Quaker, commenting \"We had 31 million viewers and it was shown all over the world, and I suddenly thought 'Should I be in this?'...I had a crisis of conscience.\" After three years playing Lou, Anna Wing asked to be written out. Wing has since revealed that creator Julia Smith was devastated when she decided to leave, commenting \"she said I could have been in it for ever and ever until I popped off for real.\"\n\nThe character was subsequently killed off, dying in her sleep in July 1988 after being frequently ill throughout the year. The character's final episodes were written by Tony Holland and directed by Julia Smith. Lou spent her final day arranging her affairs, seeing various members of her family, passing on advice and giving them presents and at the end of the episode she announced: \"That's you lot sorted. I can go now.\" At the start of episode 359, Lou was found to have died peacefully in her sleep. The episode then jumped a few days later to the day of her funeral — an emotional episode, which featured Pete breaking down at Lou's graveside and ended with him proposing a toast in the Vic to absent friends and that \"bloody old bag.\" The episode was also notable for featuring, for the first time, a train crossing the railway viaduct in Bridge Street — a special-effects shot commissioned especially for the occasion. The train was actually a ten-second illusion, produced by the BBC's electronic workshop. One \"EastEnders\" official commented: \"It cost an arm and a leg, but old Lou was worth it.\"\n\nLou was a central character, who remained at the heart of the series during her time on screen and is still occasionally referred to by long-running characters in a nostalgic nod back to the show's early history. There remains, however, a certain level of uncertainty and conflicting information regarding the character's background, in particular the number of offspring she supposedly produced.\n\nWhen \"EastEnders\" began in 1985, Pauline (Wendy Richard) and Pete (Peter Dean) were the only two of Lou's offspring to feature on screen. Through character dialogue in July 1985, the audience were told of the existence of four other children: Keith, Paul, Shirley and Norma — who had moved away to Billericay, Romford and Eastbourne before the series began. As the series progressed, these were apparently forgotten in favour of other children and were not mentioned again.\n\nCirca 1986, viewers were made aware of another child, Kenny, who had moved away to New Zealand before 1985. In addition, the character of Lou Beale also featured heavily within a series of spin-off \"EastEnders\" novels by Hugh Miller, set prior to 1985 and published in 1986. Within the novelisations readers were introduced to further characters from Lou's history: sons Harry and Ronnie, a daughter Dora and siblings Elsie, Liz, Queenie and Terence. Kenny also appeared in the books. In the \"EastEnders\" novels, Harry, Dora and Ronnie moved away from home when they were in their twenties and lost contact with their mother. The Beales' fruit and veg stall on Bridge Street market was passed to Ronnie after his father's death, and again passed to Pete when Ronnie moved away from Walford.\n\nIn February 1988 Kenny actually appeared in \"EastEnders\" for a brief stint and in December 1988 he was also seen as a young child in \"CivvyStreet\". Harry and Ronnie also appeared in the spin-off episode, but did not feature within the television serial itself.\n\nIn 1997 another of Lou's children was introduced: Maggie Flaherty (Olivia Shanley), her eldest child, who was given up for adoption as she was born out of wedlock. Other than the already established Pete, Pauline and Kenny, Maggie remains the only sibling to appear in the on-screen serial. In 2000 an \"EastEnders\" book was published entitled \"EastEnders Who's Who\". The book pertained to the existence of Ronnie and yet another child, Maureen, who had both died. Harry and Dora were not mentioned in the book and neither Maureen nor Dora has been mentioned or seen on-screen, either in the serial itself or in \"CivvyStreet\", however Pauline recounted the story of Arthur proposing to her on her unnamed sister’s wedding day on multiple occasions while she was in the show.\n\n"}

{"id": "2399872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2399872", "title": "Music licensing", "text": "Music licensing\n\nMusic licensing is the licensed use of copyrighted music. Music licensing is intended to ensure that the owners of copyrights on musical works are compensated for certain uses of their work. A purchaser has limited rights to use the work without a separate agreement.\n\nThe following words and phrases appear in discussion of music licensing:\n\nRights organizations sample radio and television broadcasts, offer blanket licenses to broadcasters, and investigate complaints to detect and prevent unauthorized performances.\n\nIn the US, ASCAP and BMI hire field agents to monitor public performances. The field agents may act as agents for the organization, negotiating a fee for a blanket license, but individuals may negotiate directly with the organization. The fee may be presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, but in case of disagreement, the fee may be appealed to the Federal District Court in the Southern District of New York.\n\n\nBroadcasting, in the context of music licensing, means the playback of recorded or live music for groups of people beyond what might be normally expected in a social setting. Legal claims are filed frequently against bookstores, bars, and live music venues that broadcast music without first obtaining a performance license.\n\nThe music broadcast in grocery stores and elevators is a service purchased from one of many organizations that offer it (the largest is Muzak). Part of the fee paid for the service is used to cover licensing costs. Except in very narrowly defined circumstances, noted below under the Section 110 \"small business exception,\" a business, restaurant, or store that plays radio broadcasts or shows TV programs in the premises does not pay a licensing fee.\n\nRadio stations pay fees to licensing bodies for nonexclusive rights to broadcast music. Radio stations and businesses typically pay a flat rate once a year, called a blanket license, which can vary based on the size of the audience, value of the advertising revenues, and amount and nature of music usage. As part of the license contract a radio station may conduct periodic audits of the music being played, with the audit results submitted to the licensing body.\n\nLicensing issues are encountered when television shows or films using copyrighted music are released on DVD format.\n\nWhen a song is cleared for usage on a TV show, historically to save money, the clearance typically applies only to television airings of the show in question. Thus, when the show is considered for DVD distribution to the home video market, the rights to the song must be renegotiated in order for the song in question to be included on the DVD. Most producers/production companies now include the rights for DVDs or \"all media now known or hereafter devised,\" which assures production companies of the right to re-release without incurring additional licensing fees.\n\nIf the process of clearing the rights to the song is prohibitively expensive for the home video distributor, or clearance is refused by the copyright holders of the original song, the affected song is either replaced with a similar one, or the footage containing the copyrighted song is edited out. In a few cases, television shows, with extensive use of copyrighted music whose cost of \"after-market\" licensing is high, are withheld from release on DVD; notable examples include \"The Wonder Years\", \"WKRP in Cincinnati\", \"Third Watch\" (beyond its first two seasons), and \"Cold Case\", some of which were eventually released after long delays. Sony Entertainment cancelled the planned October 2007 DVD release of \"Dark Skies\" for that reason, but it was eventually released on January 18, 2011 through Shout! Factory.\n\nWith certain exceptions, live performances must be licensed. In the US, the owner of a bar, cafe, or restaurant who wants to have live music usually will obtain a blanket license from ASCAP or BMI to play musical selections which they control. If a license is obtained from one company but not the other, only the music from that company may be performed. The Association for Concert Bands (ACB) offers a blanket license to community bands that covers both ASCAP and BMI lists. At the end of the year, the band completes a spreadsheet showing how often each song was played during the year, which the ACB submits to the rights organizations.\n\nPurchasing a copy of the sheet music for a copyrighted work does not give the purchaser the right to perform the music. A separate performance license must be obtained. Someone who listens to a piece of music and learns to play it must obtain a performance license before performing it in public in a commercial setting. A new arrangement for a copyrighted work is a derivative work.\n\nPermission of the rights holder is required before the work may be published, copied, or performed in public. (There now may be two copyrights, one on the original work and a second copyright on the \"new\" material contributed by the arranger.) An arrangement of a traditional song or piece of music will be protected by copyright even if the original piece is in the public domain. Every new arrangement receives a copyright. There are some exceptions to the requirement for a performance license. One set of exceptions come under the Fair use doctrine. Another set of exceptions are situations covered under Section 110 of the copyright statute.\n\nThe fair use exemption is an ill-defined, fact-based doctrine, decided by courts on a case-by-case basis. It has very limited applicability in the area of music performance and makes a weak defense in an infringement case. The use of a copyrighted work \"for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.\" There is no way in which the public, unlicensed performance of an entire piece of music can be brought under the protection of Section 107. In spite of folk wisdom to the contrary, there is no \"three second rule\" for copying or sampling recorded music. There is no rule that \"four notes\" can be copied without penalty. Instances under the fair use exception might include criticism or comment. Criticism need not be negative: if a jazz soloist quotes a phrase from a well-known solo by another player, it might be viewed as an homage. Music sampling has been aggressively pursued by copyright holders as a form of \"free riding\" but might be interpreted as a transformative use.\n\nSection 110 sets out eleven situations in which performance of a work, including broadcast, \"are not infringements of copyright\" The major exemptions are outlined in paragraphs 1 to 5. Paragraphs 1 and 2 cover face-to-face instruction, or \"distance learning,\" in non-profit educational settings. Paragraph 3 applies to performance or display in religious settings as part of a worship service. Paragraph 4 applies to non-dramatic literary or musical works (but not plays or video) performed by non-profit groups such as a community band or orchestra. Paragraph 5 is the \"small business\" exemption.\n\nA performance license need not be obtained if the work is performed or displayed \"by instructors or pupils in the course of face-to-face teaching activities of a nonprofit educational institution.\"\n\nA film shown as part of a fundraiser, or a film series might not qualify as \"face-to-face teaching activities.\" Instruction given to corporate or government employees would not qualify as a \"nonprofit educational institution.\"\n\nParagraph 2 creates a similar exemption for distance learning. A work may be performed or displayed through transmission to students enrolled in a course, or to government employees as part of their duties, without requiring a performance license. The exemption does not apply to works produced and sold for online distance learning. The performance or display must be made under the direction of the instructor and directly related to, and in aid of, what is being taught: it cannot be used as a pretext for transmission of other works. Nondramatic literary or musical works may be performed in their entirety. For other works, such as display of a film or painting, the performance must be \"reasonable and limited.\" The exemption applies only to distance learning that is part of scheduled classes. Works that are simply posted by an instructor would not be protected. The educational institution must meet certain additional conditions. It must provide information to faculty, students, and relevant staff members describing US copyright law and promoting compliance. For digital transmissions, the institution must take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized retention or further distribution of copies of the work such as not interfering with any technological means the copyright owner may have used to prevent copying.\n\nParagraph 3 creates an exemption for performance of nondramatic literary works, musical works, or dramatico-musical works of a religious nature, or display of a work, as part of religious services at a place of worship or religious assembly.\n\nSection 110 (4) creates an exemption for non-profit groups for performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work (but not a play or an opera) if four conditions are met:\n\nParagraph 5 is the \"small business exemption,\" which allows bars, cafes, and restaurants to play the radio or show television programming as \"background\" in their business. It does not authorize playing recorded music such as using a CD player, or live musical performances. The exemption covers reception of a public transmission on a single receiving apparatus of a kind commonly used in the home if no direct charge is made and the performance is not further transmitted to the public. Very specific limitations are outlined in the statute, such as number of loudspeakers permitted and square footage of the establishment.\n\nA governmental body, or a nonprofit agricultural or horticultural organization, may perform nondramatic musical works in the course of an annual agricultural or horticultural fair without obtaining a performance license.\n\nA public vending establishment may perform nondramatic musical works to promote the sale of copies of the work if there is no admission charge. The performance may not be transmitted beyond the immediate area the sale occurs.\n\nA nondramatic literary work may be performed or transmitted to blind persons or other handicapped persons who are unable to read normal printed material, or to deaf or other handicapped persons who are unable to hear the aural signals accompanying a transmission of visual signals if the performance is made without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage and the transmission is made through the facilities of a governmental body, a non-commercial educational broadcast station, a \"subcarrier\" of an FM broadcast station or a cable system.\n\nA single performance of a dramatic literary work may be transmitted specifically for the blind or other handicapped persons if the work was published at least 10 years before the date of the performance, there is no direct or indirect commercial advantage, and the transmission is made through an FM radio subcarrier as defined in paragraph 8.\n\nThe performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work in the course of a social function organized and promoted by a nonprofit veterans’ organization or a nonprofit fraternal organization is exempt. Social functions of college or university sororities or fraternities are not included under the exemption unless the social function is held solely to raise funds for a specific charitable purpose.\n\nParagraph 11 permits muting or skipping limited portions of the audio or video portions of a motion picture which is transmitted to a household for private viewing. Creating or providing a computer program which facilitates muting or skipping is also permitted, provided no alteration is made in the content, and provided no fixed copy of the altered version is created.\n\nThe song \"Happy Birthday to You\" is one of the best known songs in the world and generated over $2 million in royalties each year for its purported copyright owners even though the copyright has now been ruled invalid. In September 2015, a judge ruled that the copyright was invalid, and on February 8, 2016, Warner/Chappell Music agreed to settle a class action lawsuit brought to challenge these fees. After mediation, Warner will pay more than $14 million to the \"thousands of people and entities\" who had paid licensing fees to use the song since 1949, plus $4.6 million to attorneys for the plaintiffs.\n\nIn 1995, The American Society of Composers(ASCAP) ordered The American Camping Association to pay royalties for campfire songs sung at any of their 2300 camps. Girl Scout camps were included in the request, but only a small number of Girl Scout camps actually paid the $250 agreed upon yearly fee. The \"New York Times\" reported, \"Among the 256 Girl Scout camps on its list, 16 did.\" In March 1996, ASCAP sent letters to the Girl Scouts to pay copy right fees for campfire songs written or published by ASCAP sung in \"public performance.\" ASCAP expected to be paid license fees for any of the 4 million songs included list sung publicly.\n\nThe songs on this list include \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" and \"This Land is your land.\"\n\nIn August 1996, The \"Wall Street Journal\" published a frontpage article, \"Ascap Cautions the Girl Scouts: Don't Sing 'God Bless America,'\" describing the scene at Diablo Day Camp in Lafayette, California, as a troupe of Girl Scouts danced to the \"Macarena\" in silence for fear of copyright infringement. A public relations situation for ASCAP occurred, as the video performance of Girl Scouts silently dancing made its way onto mainstream news.\n\nASCAP confronted the Girl Scouts because of the Copyright Act of 1909, which established that any song used in public performance would be able to receive royalties. The \"Wall Street Journal\" describes the law as this: \"The law defines a public performance as 'where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered.'\"\n\nASCAP quickly sent a press statement claiming that it never intended on receiving royalties and \"has never brought nor threatened to bring suit against the Girl Scouts.\" ASCAP promised to reimburse any Girl Scout camp for the royalty fees that they may have paid. It was also reported that \"in 1940 Irving Berlin had donated all future royalties from \"God Bless America\" to the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.\" \n\nBy September 1996, Girl Scout executives in New York said they believed \"this unfortunate situation is resolved.\"\n\n\n"}

Enterprise investigates a derelict starship, meanwhile Deanna has strange dreams\n\nThe \"Enterprise\" is searching a binary star system in an effort to find the \"USS Brattain\", a Federation science vessel which went missing a month previous. The crew locates the ship but the \"Brattain\" is derelict, and all the crew are dead save one: the ship's Betazoid science adviser, Andrus Hagan, who is discovered hiding in a room just off the bridge. Hagan has somehow survived, but he has been shaken by the experience and is in a profound catatonic state. Counselor Deanna Troi tries to use her telepathy to contact Hagan. Meanwhile, Geordi La Forge and Data set to work repairing the \"Brattain\" but discover that although everything is in working order, the ship still fails to move. Dr. Beverly Crusher determines that all of the \"Brattain\"s crew died at each other's hands. That night onward, Troi has trouble sleeping, encountering the same dream in which she levitates and drifts in the direction of a mysterious voice repeating, \"Eyes in the dark, one moon circles\". Troi starts to believe Hagan was influenced by the same dream.\n\nFour days later, with the investigation stalled, Captain Picard decides that the time has come to move on, but the crew find the ship also stalled like the \"Brattain\". Data discovers that both ships are trapped in a spatial phenomenon known as a \"Tyken's Rift\", and they can only escape through the force of a tremendous explosion. However, as they work at determining how to create this explosion, the crew starts becoming irritable and experiences hallucinations. Dr. Crusher realizes that everyone, but Troi, has failed to achieve R.E.M. sleep since entering the rift, leading to their current state. As violence begins to erupt around the ship, Picard assigns Data, who does not sleep or dream and is therefore unaffected, as acting Captain.\n\nData eventually attempts to use a pulse from the deflector aimed at the center of the rift to create the explosion, but this fails to produce any effect. As Data looks for other solutions with Troi, Troi gets an idea that her dreams of \"eyes in the dark, one moon circling\" is a description of a hydrogen atom. Data and Troi work out that there must be another ship from a psychic race trapped on the other side of the rift who is aware of their presence but looking for hydrogen to create an explosion. Troi goes to sleep to contact the other species through the dream, while Data vents hydrogen into the rift. An explosion soon occurs, and both the \"Enterprise\" and the alien ship are freed. As the crew recovers, Data returns the ship to Picard, but not before ordering everyone to get some sleep.\n\nThe episode was intended as a vehicle for Marina Sirtis, however she disliked it due to her fear of heights and the requirement that she be strapped into a flying harness.\n\nThe model used for the USS \"Brattain\" is the same as was used for the USS \"Reliant\" in \"\". The ship is occasionally referred to as the USS \"Brittain\" due to a spelling error on the exterior of the model.\n\nTechRepublic placed the episode in its list of \"The five worst Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes ever\".\n\nZack Handlen of The A.V. Club noted that the episode \"...lacked that mild twist at the end to make it memorable\" but also that \"This kind of episode is really the meat-and-potatoes of this sort of show, so it's impressive to realize that TNG has gotten to the point where delivering the expected is no longer entirely satisfactory\". According to James Hunt of Den of Geek \"It’s not completely incompetent, but it’s hard to imagine anyone loving this episode\".\n\nJonathan Frakes referred to the episode as \"a yawner\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22262087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22262087", "title": "Panamanian literature", "text": "Panamanian literature\n\nPanamanian literature comprises the whole of literary works written in Panama. The first literature relating to Panama can be dated to 1535, with a modern literary movement appearing from the mid-19th century onwards\n\nPanamanian historian and essayist Rodrigo Miró (1912-1996) cites Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés as being the author of the first Panamanian literary work, the story of a character named \"Andrea de la Roca\", which was published as part of the \"Historia General y Natural de Las Indias\" (1535). \n\nThe first literature from Panamanian born authors comes from the 17th century with the title of \"Llanto de Panamá a la muerte de don Enrique Enríquez\" (Crying from Panama at the Death of Don Enrique Enríquez). Although this anthology was formed during the Colony, most of the poems in it were written by authors born in Panama. \n\nA modern literary movement appeared in Panama from the mid-19th century onwards.\n\nRodrigo Miró in his \"Itinerario de la Poesía en Panamá\" (Poetry Itinerary in Panama) talks about various Spanish authors: Mateo Rosas de Oquendo, author of an autobiographic romance; Juan de Miramontes y Zuázola, author of \"Armas Antárticas\" (Antarctic Weapons); Juan de Páramo y Cepeda, author of \"Alteraciones del Dariel\" (Dariel Alterations); and others. Also, in this period arose the author of \"La Política del Mundo\" (World Politics), Víctor de la Guardia y Ayala. \"La Política del Mundo\" is a \"stage play\" that was performed for the first time in 1809. The importance of Víctor de la Guardia y Ayala is that he was born in Panama, contrary to others that came from Spain and, for this reason, for a while he was considered the \"first Panamanian poet\".\n\nHowever, the discovery of some manuscripts which come from the 17th century caused the revision of this idea, because the first reference from this period which indicates a written production by Panamanian authors (in other words, born in Panama) dates from 1638 and it is an anthology called \"Llanto de Panamá a la muerte de don Enrique Enríquez\" (Crying from Panama at the Death of Don Enrique Enríquez). This anthology groups works written for the death of Enrique Enríquez, governor of Panama. It was edited for the first time in Madrid (1642) and its author was Mateo Ribera (Panamanian); also he wrote many poems in this work. Although most of \"Llanto de Panamá\"´s poems were written by Panamanians, it has many works written by Spanish authors.\n\nThis discovery was accomplished by the Spanish diplomat Antonio Serrano de Haro, who also studied these manuscripts. A new version of this anthology was published at 1984 in a combined job between the Universidad de Panamá and the \"Instituto de Cultura Hispánica\". This discovery confirms, in fact, that the first Panamanian literary manifestations (found until now) come from the 17th century.\n\nPanama was not isolated from revolutionary movements which were seeking the independence of colonies from Spain. The drive for independence was accomplished with the Independence of Panama from Spain on November 28, 1821. As in other colonies, Panamanian Romanticism was related to, and influenced by, libertarian and nationalist notions. Much of the literature of the period was produced by amateur authors; professional authors remained few.\n\nAmong the first romantic Panamanian poets were Manuel María Ayala (1785–1824) and Tomás Miró Rubini (1800–1881), followed by José María Alemán (1830–1887), Gil Colunje (1831–1899), Tomás Martín Feuillet (1832–1899), José Dolores Urriola (1834–1883), Amelia Denis de Icaza (1836–1911), Manuel José Pérez (1837–1895), Jeronimo de la Ossa (1847–1907), Federico Escobar (1861–1912) and Rodolfo Caicedo (1868–1905).\n\nRomantic poetry, tinged with notions of nationalism, would be the main theme in Panamanian poetic works until the mid-20th century when avant-garde poetry arrived in Panama.\n\nIn 1903, Panama separated from Colombia; this time saw the peak of modernism in Hispanic literature. The first modernist was Darío Herrera (1870–1914), friend and follower of Rubén Darío, whom he met in Buenos Aires. Another important poet was León Antonio Soto (1874–1902), who died at a young age when tortured by the police for having championed the cause of Panama.\n\nTwo literary magazines focused mainly on the dissemination of the modernist movement: \"El Heraldo del Istmo\" (1904–1906), directed by Guillermo Andreve (1879–1940), and \"Nuevos Ritos\" (1907), founded by Ricardo Miró (1883–1940). Ricardo Miró is perhaps the most prominent poet of Panamanian modernism. His poem \"Patria\" (1909) is also famous.\n\nAt this time, Gaspar Octavio Hernández (1893–1918), author of \"Melodías del pasado\" (1915) and \"La copa de amatista\" (1923), was also active. Other notable poets of the same generation were María Olimpia de Obaldía (1891–1985) and Demetrio Korsi (1899–1957).\n\nSince 1930, coinciding with the \"Communal Action\" (\"Acción Comunal\") youth revolution, a new generation of poets, grouped around the magazine \"Antena\", distanced itself from modernist rhetoric, instead approaching the avant-garde. The main reference for this transformation was Rogelio Sinán (Taboga, 1902 – Panamá, 1994), an author who had traveled in Europe and visited the surrealists in Paris. \"Onda\" (1929) shows the influence of pure poetry; other major works by Sinan include \"Incendios\" (1944) and \"Semana Santa en la niebla\" (1949), in which dreamlike elements show his surrealist affiliation.\n\nSurrealism is also evident in the work of Ricardo J. Bermúdez (1914), whose most famous work is \"Laurel de cenizas\" (1951). The work of Demetrio Herrera Sevillano (1902–1950) is also a part of this avant-garde movement; his work was greatly influenced by \"ultraísmo\".\n\nAnother poet of this era, who was also a short-story writer and journalist, was Mario Augusto Rodríguez (1917). In 1957, he published his poetry collection \"Canto de amor para la Patría novia\", a poetic history of the Panamanian nation.\n\nOther major poets of this era include Stella Sierra, Roque Javier Laurenza, Ofelia Hooper, Tobías Díaz Blaitry (1919–2006), Tristán Solarte (1934), José de Jesús Martínez, Diana Morán (1932), Alvaro Menéndez Franco (1932), Luis Carlos Jiménez Varela, José Guillermo Ross-Zanet (1930), José Franco (1931), and Elsie Alvarado de Ricord (1928–2005).\n\nMajor poets of the next generation included Benjamín Ramón (1939), Bertalicia Peralta (1939), Ramón Oviero (1939–2008), Moravia Ochoa López (1941), Dimas Lidio Pitty (1941-2015), Roberto Fernández Iglesias (1941), Eric Arce (1942), Enrique Jaramillo Levi (1944), Jarl Ricardo Babot (1945), Giovanna Benedetti (1950), Manuel Orestes Nieto (1951), Moisés Pascual (1955), Consuelo Tomás (1957), Héctor M. Collado (1960), and Pablo Menacho (1960).\n\nAt the end of the 20th century emerged a new generation of poets, who began to publish after 1990. Major poets of this era include Javier Romero Hernández (Chorrera, 1983), Sofía Santim (Panamá, 1982), Javier Alvarado (Santiago de Veraguas, 1982), Salvador Medina Barahona (Mariabé de Pedasí, 1973), Eyra Harbar Gomez (Bocas del Toro, 1972), Porfirio Salazar (1970), Katia Chiari (Panamá, 1969), and Alexander Zanches (David, Chiriquí, 1968).\n\nThe short story in Panama can be said to have begun formally in 1903, when Darío Herrera (1870–1914) published the first book of stories by a Panamanian author, Horas Lejanas, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Since this time, the short story has been the most important literary genre in Panama.\n\nNearly all modernist and postmodernist poets in Panama published stories during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Of these, Salomón Ponce Aguilera (1868–1945), Guillermo Andreve, Gaspar Octavio Hernández (1883–1940), and Ricardo Miró (1883–1940) stand out as poets whose short stories, often scattered and unpublished, were picked up and commented on by writer Mario Augusto Rodríguez in 1956. Other important authors of this period include José María Núñez (1894–1990), Moisés Castillo (1899–1974), and Gil Blas Tejeira (1901–1975).\n\nOne notable author of the next generation was Rogelio Sinán (1902-1994), author of the novel \"Plenilunio\" and the collections of stories \"A la orilla de las estatuas maduras\" (1946), \"La boina roja y cinco cuentos\" (1954), \"Cuentos de Rogelio Sinán\" (1971), and \"El candelabro de los malos ofidios\" (1982). Other authors of this generation included Lucas Bárcenas (1906–1992), César Candanedo (1906–1993), Renato Ozores (1910–2001), Alfredo Cantón (1910-1967), Ricardo Bermúdez (1914–2000), Mario Augusto Rodríguez (Santiago de Veraguas, 1917) (author of \"Campo Adentro\" (1947), \"Luna en Veraguas\" (1948), and \"Los ultrajados\" (1994)), José María Sánchez (1918–1973), Ramón H. Jurado (1922–1978), Joaquín Beleño (1921), Carlos Francisco Changmarín (1922), Jorge Turner (1922), Tristán Solarte (1924) and José Guillermo Ros-Zanet (1930). In this generation, authors cultivated nationalistic themes, either from the point of view of the cities at each end of the Panama Canal and their relation to the Canal Zone, or from rural point of view from the interior of the country.\n\nThe next generation is that of authors born since 1932. Many of these authors are still producing literary works. Major authors of this generation include Ernesto Endara (1932), Álvaro Menéndez Franco (1932), Enrique Chuez (1934), Justo Arroyo (1936), Rosa María Britton (1936), Victoria Jiménez Vélez (1937), Pedro Rivera (1939), Benajamín Ramón (1939), Beatríz Valdés (1940), Gloria Guardia (1940), Dimas Lidio Pitty (1941), Moravia Ochoa López (1941), Mireya Hernández (1942–2006), Enrique Jaramillo Levi (1944), Isabel Herrera de Taylor (1944), Raúl Leis (1947), Giovanna Benedetti (1949), Lupita Quirós Athanasiadis (1950), Rey Barría (1951), Ramón Fonseca Mora (1952), Herastro Reyes (1952–2005), Claudio de Castro (1957), Consuelo Tomás (1957), Yolanda Hackshaw (1958), Allen Patiño (1959), Rafael Alexis Álvarez (1959), Ariel Barría Alvarado (1959), Héctor Collado (1960), Gonzalo Menéndez González (1960), David Robinson Orobio (1960), Erika Harris (1963), and Rogelio Guerra Ávila (1963), Javier Stanziola (1971). This generation is notable for its abandonment of \"criollismo\" as a narrative theme in favor of universal themes, and in some cases, emphasizing dream and fantasy.\n\nPublishing for the first time in the 1990s, the newest generation of Panamanian storytellers has emerged. Among these writers are Carlos Fong (1967), Carlos Oriel Wynter Melo (1971), José Luis Rodríguez Pittí (1971), Melanie Taylor (1972), Lili Mendoza (1974), Lilian Guevara (1974), Roberto Pérez-Franco (1976), Gloria Melania Rodríguez (1981), and Annabel Miguelena (1984).\nThis generation is characterized by the use of short fiction, poetic and imaginative language, and human themes, in which the individual stands out above a chaotic, typically urban environment.\n\n"}

{"id": "43742178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43742178", "title": "Piper Chapman", "text": "Piper Chapman\n\nPiper Elizabeth Chapman is a fictional character (played by Taylor Schilling) and the protagonist of the Netflix series \"Orange Is the New Black\". She is based on Piper Kerman, author of the non-fiction book \"\", upon which the series is based. Schilling was nominated for awards in both comedy and drama categories for this role.\n\nA Boston-bred Smith College grad, Piper Kerman got involved in a relationship with an international drug smuggler, Catherine Cleary Wolters. Chapman's girlfriend in the series, Alex Vause, is based on Wolters, whom Kerman met circa 1991 in Northampton, Massachusetts. Eventually, 24-year-old Kerman flew a suitcase of money from the United States to Belgium for a West African drug lord and was named five years later as part of the drug ring. As part of her plea bargain, she declared that she made three overseas trips on behalf of the drug ring. After breaking up with Wolters, Kerman met Larry Smith and got engaged before being charged by the feds in 1998 and striking a deal. She spent 13 months in a Danbury, Connecticut women's prison, FCI Danbury. Kerman actually had a six-year delay between being sentenced to prison and entering prison in 2004. The show is based on Kerman's 2010 book \"\" about her year in a minimum security federal women's prison. Chapman's fiance, Larry Bloom, is based on Smith, Kerman's real life boyfriend and eventual husband.\n\nSeries creator Jenji Kohan had initially considered casting Katie Holmes in the role, but decided against it as Holmes had too many commitments. Ultimately Kohan cast Taylor Schilling.\n\nChapman is a 31-year-old White Anglo-Saxon Protestant who is sentenced to 15 months in prison for carrying a bag of drug-money ($50,000) to Belgium for her girlfriend, Alex Vause. Prior to prison, Chapman owned an artisanal bath soap business in Brooklyn. She comes from a wealthy family, and was a debutante as a teenager. She is originally from Connecticut. Chapman is bisexual, and in college was in a relationship with Alex Vause (Laura Prepon), a drug smuggler. 10 years prior to the series' beginning, she carried drug money from Colombia to Belgium with Vause. Eventually, Chapman grew disenchanted with Vause's lifestyle and broke up with her. She then began dating Larry Bloom (Jason Biggs), to whom she got engaged.\n\nPiper is one of very few emphatically atheist inmates on the show. She responds to a request that she baptise herself by saying that she cannot pretend to believe in a god, saying that while it might make her happier if she believed in a religion, she \"needs it to be true\", and instead looks to science to explain the world. In another episode, when confronted on the subject again, she clarifies that \"I've always thought agnostic was a sort of cop-out... If I had to label it I'd say that I'm a secular humanist.\"\n\nIn 2018, Schilling stated that while Walter White of \"Breaking Bad\" was written with having a rationale for each action, \"Piper’s behavior oftentimes feels groundless\" and \"the audience can’t quite grab onto Piper’s behavior. It seems like it’s coming out of nowhere.\"\n\nChapman is sentenced to 15 months in Litchfield Prison for Criminal conspiracy and Money laundering; Vause had been arrested and named Chapman as an accomplice in order to reduce her own sentence. On her first day, Chapman gets felt up by guard George \"Pornstache\" Mendez (Pablo Schreiber) and unintentionally offends prison matriarch Red (Kate Mulgrew), who runs the prison cafeteria. Red starves Chapman to make an example of her, and the other inmates are too intimidated to help except for Crazy Eyes (Uzo Aduba). Nonetheless, Chapman resists Crazy Eyes' subsequent advances, and makes amends with Red by making her lotion to help her back. She befriends Nicky Nichols (Natasha Lyonne), who becomes her confidante and protector. She also discovers Vause is sentenced to the same prison.\n\nChapman is assigned to the prison electrical workshop and accidentally steals a screwdriver. Her cellmate Miss Claudette (Michelle Hurst) helps her evade the guards' searches. In order to ingratiate herself with the other inmates, Chapman offers to review their appeal letters.\n\nAlthough Bloom learns that Vause was the informant who gave Chapman up, he does not share this information with her. Chapman then rekindles her relationship with Vause. Meanwhile, Bloom, an aspiring writer, publishes a story about Chapman's incarceration that paints unflattering portraits of her fellow inmates and the prison staff. The article earns Chapman the ire of both the guards and the other prisoners, and puts a severe strain on her already fading relationship with Bloom.\n\nChapman is elected to the prison council, but finds that the only change she is able to make is to get the track reopened for Janae Watson (Vicky Jeudy) who was put in solitary confinement during the screwdriver incident. Chapman makes an enemy of Tiffany \"Pennsatucky\" Doggett (Taryn Manning), who wanted her spot on the council. Doggett tells inmate counselor Sam Healy (Michael J. Harney) about Chapman and Vause's relationship; Healy punishes her by putting her in solitary confinement and telling Bloom about the affair. Bloom gets back at Chapman by doing an interview on NPR that casts Litchfield in a harsh light, which makes her even more unpopular. During an angry phone call, Bloom reveals that Vause informed on her. Vause asks Chapman to choose between her and Bloom. Chapman chooses Bloom, but Vause breaks them up and spurns Chapman. When Doggett attacks Chapman with a shiv, Chapman finally snaps and beats her to a pulp.\n\nAfter spending a month in solitary confinement, Chapman is flown to Chicago to serve as a witness against the drug kingpin who had been Vause's boss. There, she spends time in a maximum security prison with dangerous inmates who menace her daily. Also in episode 1, \"Thirsty Bird\", we see Chapman as a young girl (Clare Foley) in a flashback, discovering that her father is cheating on her mother. Vause persuades Chapman to commit perjury in order to keep them safe from the drug lord, but ultimately cuts a deal to testify against her former boss in return for early release; she then leaves Chapman to suffer the consequences of her perjured testimony alone. In episode 3, \"Hugs Can Be Deceiving\", we find out that Crazy Eyes had run outside and knocked Chapman unconscious after she had beaten up Doggett at the end of season 1. In episode 6, \"You Also Have a Pizza\", Chapman starts a prison newsletter, and makes a deal with a reporter to investigate the financial goings on at the prison. She eventually uncovers evidence that assistant warden Natalie Figueroa (Alysia Reiner) has been embezzling from the prison. To keep her quiet, Figueroa arranges for Chapman to be transferred to a facility in Virginia. However, when Chapman gives prison administrator Joe Caputo (Nick Sandow) the evidence implicating Figueroa, he cancels the transfer and gives the warden the incriminating information, resulting in Figueroa's resignation.\n\nChapman gets a furlough to go to her grandmother's funeral. At home in New York City, she realizes that Larry has lost interest in her, and soon learns that he has fallen in love with her best friend, Polly Harper (Maria Dizzia). Chapman is furious at first, but eventually agrees to give them her blessing in return for either of them telling Vause's parole officer that Vause is going to break parole, which will land her back in Litchfield prison\n\nChapman begins a business selling used panties to people outside of Litchfield, enlisting her brother Cal as her middleman. Chapman begins a romantic relationship with an Australian prisoner, Stella. After Stella steals Chapman's money, she plants contraband in Stella's bunk and orchestrates her being sent to the maximum security unit in retaliation the day before Stella's release date.\n\nChapman continues her panty business but finds herself in competition with a group of Dominicans led by Maria Ruiz. When Chapman aligns herself with a gang of white supremacists and plants contraband in Maria's bunk, Maria retaliates by kidnapping her and having her branded with a swastika.\n\nAccording to Todd VanDerWerff of Vox Media's Vox.com Chapman was a character with \"tricky contradictions and likability issues\". In reviewing season 1, Matthew Wolfson \"Slant Magazine\" describes Chapman as \"a familiar vessel through which to comprehend prison's unfamiliar terrain\". Over the course of the first season, the show becomes less focused on Chapman, according to James Poniewozik of \"Time\". \"The Boston Globe\" describes Chapman's assimilation into prison as a display of \"Martha Stewart-like efforts to survive\". At the time of the Golden Globe Award nomination, \"Entertainment Weekly\" described Chapman in prison as a woman who was \"totally out of her element\" and said that the role was dichotomous with demands to \"vacillate between being sympathy-worthy and trying fans’ patience with Chapman’s entitlement\". Tom Meltzer of \"The Guardian\" wrote \"Chapman's romantic and rebellious re-awakening drives the show, but it is the ensemble that kept us coming back for more\".\n\nBy season 2, Piper remained a main character of an ensemble cast but not the central character according to IGN's Matt Fowler. Liz Raftery of \"TV Guide\" says \"There's a lot going on in Season 2 of Netflix's Orange Is the New Black, and very little of it has to do with Piper Chapman\". Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" considered that the show's ensemble focus has turned Piper into \"dead weight\" and \"nobody would argue that an early parole for her would hurt the show\". As he reviewed season 2, \"The Huffington Post\" Canada entertainment editor Chris Jancelewicz, opined that \"Schilling's deadpan expressions and snap comedic timing help us empathize and grow to love her\" as her character became more understandable. Alicia Lutes of \"MTV\" wrote that as of Season 2 the show is about Piper understanding herself and her capabilities better \"even if those abilities put her further in the muck\" and not about her possible reformation.\n\nSarene Leeds of \"The Wall Street Journal\" stated that in Season 3 Piper changed from being \"a gangsta wannabe into a dangerous villain that is not to be crossed\" after planting contraband in girlfriend Stella's bed to get her sent to the maximum security unit in retaliation for Stella stealing from her; Leeds argued that the change \"is a necessary plot device to keep things interesting\" even though she did not like the new version of Piper. Drew Millard of \"Vice\" wrote that Season 3 Piper went \"completely off the deep end\" and changed \"into the most unlikable version of herself\", making her \"deadweight on a show that was at first strictly about her.\" Kerman stated that even though she still found the series to be entertaining, she could no longer relate to Piper Chapman. Sadie Gennis of \"TV Guide\" also suggested removing Chapman from the show.\n\nSchilling has been nominated for awards in both comedy and drama categories: Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards and Best Actress – Television Series Drama at the 71st Golden Globe Awards and won Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy at the 18th Satellite Awards for her season 1 performance. Her season 2 performance earned a 72nd Golden Globe Awards nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy, and a 19th Satellite Awards nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. Her season 3 performance won Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy at the 20th Satellite Awards.\n\n\n"}

Each Rajputana kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana. Miniatures in manuscripts or single sheets to be kept in albums were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but many paintings were done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelis, particularly, the havelis of Shekhawati, the forts and palaces built by Shekhawat Rajputs.\n\nThe colours were extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones. Gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colours was a lengthy process, sometimes taking 2 weeks. Brushes used were very fine.\n\nWhile there exist a plethora of themes in Rajput paintings, a common motif found throughout Rajput works is the purposeful manipulation of space. In particular, the inclusion of fuller spaces is meant to emphasize the lack of boundaries and inseparability of characters and landscapes. In this way, the individuality of physical characters is almost rejected, allowing both the depicted backgrounds and human figures to be equally expressive.\n\nOutside of a purely artistic standpoint, Rajput paintings were often politically charged and commented on social values of the time. Mewar's rulers wanted these painting to portray their ambitions and establish their legacy. Therefore, paintings were often indicative of a ruler's legacy or their changes made to better society.\n\nBoth of these factors clearly distinguish Rajput paintings from Mughal works. While, from a chronological standpoint, both of these cultures clashed with one another, Rajput paintings only superficially adopted Mughal fashion and cultural standards. Elements, such as distinct portraiture, utilized by popular Mughal artists (Govardhan, Hashim, etc.) are not found in Rajput works. Likewise, Rajput techniques are not predominantly seen in Mughal paintings. \"\"\n\nIn the late 16th Century, Rajput art schools began to develop distinctive styles, combining indigenous as well as foreign influences such as Persian, Mughal, Chinese and European. Rajasthani painting consists of four principal schools that have within them several artistic styles and substyles that can be traced to the various princely states that patronised these artists. The four principal schools are:\n\nThe Kangra and Kullu schools of art are also part of Rajput painting. Nainsukh is a famous artist of Pahari painting, working for Rajput princes who then ruled that far north.\n\nEconomic prosperity of commercial community and revival of “Vaisnavism” and the growth of Bhakti Cult were the major factors that contributed greatly to the development of Rajasthani paintings. In the beginning this style was greatly influenced by religious followers like Ramanuja, Meerabai, Tulsidas, Sri Chaitanya, Kabir and Ramanand.\n\nAll of Rajputana was affected by the attack of the Mughals but Mewar did not come under their control till the last. This was the reason that Rajasthani school flourished first in Mewar, (the purest form and later on in), Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bundi, Kota- Kalam, Kishangarh, Bikaner and other places of Rajasthan.\n\n\n094414229X.\n\n\n"}

It is located at 150 West 17th Street between the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) and Seventh Avenue in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.\nThe museum originated from a private collection of Himalayan art which Donald and Shelley Rubin had been assembling since 1974. In 1998, the Rubins paid $22 million for the building that had been occupied by Barneys New York, a designer fashion department store that had filed for bankruptcy. The building was remodeled as a museum by preservation architects Beyer Blinder Belle. The original six-story spiral staircase was left intact to become the center of the of exhibition space.\n\nThe museum opened on October 2, 2004, and displays more than 1,000 objects including paintings, sculpture, and textiles, as well as ritual objects from the 2nd to the 20th centuries. The new facade on 17th Street and the five floors of galleries were influenced by Tibetan art, and were conceived by New York-based museum architects Celia Imrey and Tim Culbert. Its graphic identity was conceived by graphic designer Milton Glaser.\n\nBesides exhibitions based on the museum's permanent collection, it also serves as a venue for national and international traveling exhibitions. The museum is affiliated with the Himalayan Art website to advance the study of Himalayan arts and culture.\n\nThe museum's exhibitions and programs are supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York State Music Fund, the New York State Council on the Arts, the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, other corporate and foundation donors, and a roster of corporate and individual members.\n\nIn 2011, the museum announced that founders Donald and Shelley Rubin would give a five-year, $25 million gift to support operations, exhibitions, and programs. Donald Rubin also planned to step down as chief executive, although the couple were to continue to lead the museum's board.\n\nThe 70,000-square-foot museum occupies what was formerly a portion of the Barneys department store in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. It was acquired in 1998 and renovated extensively from 2000-2004. The renovation and new design elements were the results of a collaboration headed by the architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle and including Atelier Imrey Culbert (associate museum designers) and Milton Glaser Incorporated. Many of the architectural details within the building were retained, most notably Andree Putman's steel-and-marble staircase that spirals through the six-story gallery tower. In addition to gallery space for featured exhibitions, the museum includes space for contemporary and historical photography, an art-making studio, a theater for multimedia events and performances, a café, and a gift shop. In September 2011, the museum opened a new 5,000 square-foot Education Center adjacent to the main museum building. The new space provides greatly expanded spaces to better facilitate lifelong learning and serve more visitors in deeper, more substantial ways. The Education Center was designed by Lee H. Skolnick Architecture + Design Partnership.\n\nAmong the museum's inaugural exhibitions were \"Methods of Transcendance\" and \"Portraits of Transmission\" (both October 2004-January 2005) and \"The Demonic Divine in Himalayan Art\" (October 2004-March 2006). In 2006, a three-part exhibition called \"Holy Madness\" spotlighted siddhas with \"Portraits of Tantric Siddhas,\" \"Mahasiddhas at Gyantse,\" and \"Mahasiddhas at Alchi.\" Not limited in its focus to Buddhist and Hindu religious objects, \"I See No Stranger: Early Sikh Art and Devotion\" (September 2006-January 2007), \"Bon: The Magic Word\" (November 2007-February 2008), and \"Victorious Ones: Jain Images of Perfection\" (September 2009-February 2010) exhibited works related to each of those faiths. June thru August of 2008, the museum held an exhibit entitled \"Buddha in Paradise\" which was made up of \"40 works, from the 13th to the early 20th century, of painting, sculpture, and ritual texts\" from the museums collection.\n\nIn 2010, the \"Gateway to Himalayan Art\" exhibition opened on the museum's second floor. Presenting the fundamentals of Himalayan art, it explains the symbolism, iconography, and ritual implements in the artworks as well as the materials from which they are made. The exhibit was to remain on view until 2014, with yearly rotations of specific objects. A two-year exhibit on the third floor, \"Masterworks: Jewels of the Collection\" (March 2011-January 2013), highlights the stylistic diversity of the museum's holdings and the connections between Himalayan and neighboring artistic traditions.\n\nThe Rubin Museum offers an array of on- and off-site educational programs, as well as public programs such as talks and discussions; film screenings; live music, dance, poetry and other performances; and art demonstrations. The museum continues to refine a museum-wide access program in order to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities and special needs, language challenges, and at-risk and underserved segments of the population. A visit to the Rubin Museum is enhanced by the presence of guides in the galleries, American Sign Language tours, verbal imaging and touch tours, and a wheelchair-accessible facility. Assistive listening devices and wheelchairs are also provided.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

It was probably inspired by the San Cassiano Altarpiece by Antonello da Messina (1475-1476), and absorbed and further developed that work's innovations. Yet, as the dating of Bellini's painting is uncertain, such dependency cannot be proved.\nThe work is among Bellini's most famous, a claim made as early as \"De Urbe Sito\", a description of Venice by Marco Antonio Sabellico (1487-1491).\nThe depiction of Saints Sebastian and Job indicates that the painting might be created in connection with the plague probably that of 1987. The dating of the work is disputed, ranging from the early 1470s to the late 1480s. Jacopo Sansovino wrote in 1581 that the work for San Giobbe was Bellini's first using oil painting, which would imply an earlier date, nearer to Antonello's altarpiece. Yet, many scholars have disputed such claim.\n\nThe altarpiece remained in the church of San Giobbe until 1814-1818.\n\nThe work can be read as an example of Holy Conversation: Mary sits on a tall marble throne, holding the Child; at her feet are three musician angels, while at the side are, in symmetrical positions, six saints. They are, on the left, Sts. Francis, John the Baptist and Job; on the right, Sts. Dominic, Sebastian and Louis of Toulouse.

It opened on September 21, 1896 and is the oldest surviving theater in Central Ohio and one of the oldest in the state of Ohio. The Southern Theatre is currently owned and operated as a home for live concerts, plays and opera by CAPA (the Columbus Association for the Performing Arts). CAPA also manages several other venues in Columbus including the Ohio, the Palace, and the Lincoln Theatres.\n\nBetween 1889 and 1893 a series of fires destroyed five downtown Columbus theaters. As a result, a group of businessmen decided to develop a new hotel and theater with modern construction and safety features on the southern edge of downtown. The building was called \"The Great Southern Fireproof Hotel and Opera House\", and was designed by the local architectural firm of Dauben, Krumm, and Riebel. Construction began in 1894. Both the theater and the hotel were constructed of \"fireproof\" tile, brick, iron, steel, and concrete.\n\nThe theater's auditorium design was progressive for its day and was reminiscent of Louis H. Sullivan's 1891 Schiller Theatre in Chicago. From the proscenium opening, a series of concentric arches dotted with incandescent electric lights radiate into the house, resulting in superior lighting and excellent acoustics. Built to be self-sufficient, the theater, one of the first commercial buildings in Columbus to use electricity, generated its own power. Additionally, the building had three wells in the basement, from which it produced its own water supply. The theatre currently seats 933 and is an intimate \"jewel box\" type theater with two balconies.\n\nIn 1982, the Southern Theatre and its associated hotel were added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Great Southern Theatre originally hosted theatrical touring productions. Sarah Bernhardt was just one of the famous performers to play the theater in its first two decades. In the 1910s and 1920s the theater, now called the Southern, featured first run silent films and live vaudeville. From the 1930s on, the Southern was a popular home for second-run double features. In the 1970s the theater briefly returned to first run fare as the Towne Cinema, showing black exploitation movies. Throughout the 1970s the Southern also hosted a weekly live Country Music Jamboree, sponsored by local radio station WMNI.\n\nThe theater closed in 1979 and in 1986 was acquired by CAPA. After sitting empty for nearly two decades, the Southern was completely restored by CAPA in 1997-98 during an extensive 14-month rebuilding process. The newly restored Southern Theatre reopened on September 26, 1998.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4801957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4801957", "title": "The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)", "text": "The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)\n\nThe Last Judgment () is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance painter Michelangelo covering the whole altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. It is a depiction of the Second Coming of Christ and the final and eternal judgment by God of all humanity. The souls of humans rise and descend to their fates, as judged by Christ who is surrounded by prominent saints. Altogether there are over 300 figures, with nearly all the males and angels originally shown as nudes; many were later partly covered up by painted draperies, of which some remain after recent cleaning and restoration. \n\nThe work took over four years to complete between 1536 and 1541 (preparation of the altar wall began in 1535). Michelangelo began working on it twenty-five years after having finished the Sistine Chapel ceiling, and was nearly 67 at its completion. Michelangelo originally accepted the commission from Pope Clement VII, but it was completed under Pope Paul III, whose stronger reforming views probably affected the final treatment.\n\nIn the lower part of the fresco, Michelangelo followed tradition in showing the saved ascending at the left and the damned descending at the right. In the upper part, the inhabitants of Heaven are joined by the newly saved. The fresco is more monochromatic than the ceiling frescoes and is dominated by the tones of flesh and sky. The cleaning and restoration of the fresco, however, revealed a greater chromatic range than previously apparent. Orange, green, yellow, and blue are scattered throughout, animating and unifying the complex scene.\n\nThe reception of the painting was mixed from the start, with much praise but also criticism on both religious and artistic grounds. Both the amount of nudity and the muscular style of the bodies has been one area of contention, and the overall composition another.\n\nWhere traditional compositions generally contrast an ordered, harmonious heavenly world above with the tumultuous events taking place in the earthly zone below, in Michelangelo's conception the arrangement and posing of the figures across the entire painting give an impression of agitation and excitement, and even in the upper parts there is \"a profound disturbance, tension and commotion\" in the figures. Sidney J. Freedberg interprets their \"complex responses\" as \"those of giant powers here made powerless, bound by racking spiritual anxiety\", as their role of intercessors with the deity had come to an end, and perhaps they regret some of the verdicts. There is an impression that all the groups of figures are circling the central figure of Christ in a huge rotary movement.\n\nAt the centre of the work is Christ, shown as the individual verdicts of the Last Judgement are pronounced; he looks down towards the damned. He is beardless, and \"compounded from antique conceptions of Hercules, Apollo, and Jupiter Fulminator\", probably, in particular, the Belvedere Apollo, brought to the Vatican by Pope Julius II. However, there are parallels for his pose in earlier \"Last Judgments\", especially one in the Camposanto of Pisa, which Michelangelo would have known; here the raised hand is part of a gesture of \"ostentatio vulnerum\" (\"display of the wounds\"), where the resurrected Christ reveals the wounds of his Crucifixion, which can be seen on Michelangelo's figure.\n\nTo the left of Christ is his mother, Virgin Mary, who turns her head to look down towards the Saved, though her pose also suggests resignation. It appears that the moment has passed for her to exercise her traditional role of pleading on behalf of souls; with John the Baptist this Deesis is a regular motif in earlier compositions. Preparatory drawings show her standing and facing Christ with arms outstretched, in a more traditional intercessory posture.\n\nSurrounding Christ are large numbers of figures, the saints and other saved souls. On a similar scale to Christ are John the Baptist on the left, and on the right Saint Peter, holding the keys of Heaven and perhaps offering them back to Christ, as they will no longer be needed. Several of the main saints appear to be showing Christ their attributes, the evidence of the martyrdom. This used to be interpreted as the saints calling for the damnation of those who had not served the cause of Christ, but other interpretations have become more common, including that the saints are themselves not certain of their own verdicts, and try at the last moment to remind Christ of their sufferings.\n\nOther prominent saints include Saint Bartholomew below Peter, holding the attribute of his martyrdom, his own skin. The face on this is usually recognized as being a self-portrait of Michelangelo. Many others, even of the larger saints, are difficult to identify. Ascanio Condivi, Michelangelo's tame authorized biographer, says that all of the Twelve Apostles are shown around Christ, \"but he does not attempt to name them and would probably have had a difficult time doing so\".\n\nThe movements of the souls reflect the traditional pattern. They arise from their graves at bottom left, and some continue upwards, helped in several cases by angels in the air (mostly without wings) or others on clouds, pulling them up. Others, the damned, apparently pass over to the right, though none are quite shown doing so; there is a zone in the lower middle that is empty of souls. A boat rowed by an aggressive Charon, who ferried souls to the Underworld in classical mythology (and Dante), brings souls to land beside the entrance to Hell; his threatening them with his oar is a direct borrowing from Dante. Satan, the traditional Christian devil is not shown, but another classical figure, Minos, supervises the admission of the Damned into Hell; this was his role in Dante's \"Inferno\". He is generally agreed to have been given the features of Biagio da Cesena, a critic of Michelangelo in the Papal court.\n\nIn the centre above Charon is a group of angels on clouds, seven blowing trumpets (as in the Book of Revelation), other holding books that record the names of the Saved and Damned. To their right is a larger figure of a soul who has just realized that he is damned, and appears paralyzed with horror. Two devils are pulling him downwards. To the right of this devils pull down other souls; some are being pushed down by angels above them.\n\nThe Last Judgment was a traditional subject for large church frescos, but it was unusual to place it at the east end, over the altar. The traditional position was on the west wall, over the main doors at the back of a church, so that the congregation took this reminder of their options away with them on leaving. It might be either painted on the interior, as for example by Giotto at the Arena Chapel, or in a sculpted tympanum on the exterior. However, a number of late medieval panel paintings, mostly altarpieces, were based on the subject with similar compositions, although adapted to a horizontal picture space. These include the \"Beaune Altarpiece\" by Rogier van der Weyden, and ones by artists such as Fra Angelico, Hans Memling and Hieronymus Bosch. Many aspects of Michelangelo's composition reflect the well-established traditional Western depiction, but with a fresh and original approach.\n\nMost traditional versions had a figure of \"Christ in Majesty\" in about the same position as Michelangelo's, and even larger than his, with a greater disproportion in scale to the other figures. As here, compositions contained large numbers of figures, divided between angels and saints around Christ at the top, and the souls being judged below. Typically there is a strong contrast between the ordered ranks of figures in the top part, and chaotic and frenzied activity below, especially on the right side that leads to Hell. The flow of souls usually began at the bottom (viewer's) left, as here, as resurrected souls rise from their graves and move towards judgement. Some pass judgement and continue upwards or to the left, to join the company in heaven, while others pass over to the right and then downwards towards Hell in the bottom right corner (compositions had difficulty incorporating Purgatory visually). The damned souls may be shown naked, as a mark of their humiliation as devils carry them off, and sometimes the newly-resurrected souls too, but angels and those in Heaven are fully dressed, their clothing a main clue to the identity of groups and individuals.\n\nThe project was a long time in gestation. It was probably first proposed in 1533, but was not then attractive to Michelangelo. A number of letters and other sources describe the original subject as a \"Resurrection\", but it seems most likely that this was always meant in the sense of the General Resurrection of the Dead, followed in Christian eschatology by the Last Judgment, rather than the Resurrection of Jesus. Other scholars believe there was indeed a substitution of the more sombre final subject, reflecting the emerging mood of the Counter-Reformation, and an increase in the area of the wall to be covered. A number of Michelangelo's drawings from the early 1530s develop a \"Resurrection of Jesus\".\n\nVasari, alone among contemporary sources, says that originally Michelangelo was intended to paint the other end wall with a Fall of the Rebel Angels to match. By April 1535 the preparation of the wall was begun, but it was over a year before painting began. Michelangelo stipulated the filling-in of two narrow windows, the removal of three cornices, and building the surface increasingly forward as it rises, to give a single uninterrupted wall surface slightly leaning out, by about 11 inches over the height of the fresco.\n\nThe preparation of the wall led to the end of more than twenty years of friendship between Michelangelo and Sebastiano del Piombo, who tried to persuade the Pope and Michelangelo to do the painting in his preferred technique of oil on plaster, and managed to get the smooth plaster finish needed for this applied. It is possible that around this stage the idea was floated that Sebastiano would do the actual painting, to Michelangelo's designs, as they had collaborated nearly 20 years earlier. After, according to Vasari, some months of passivity, Michelangelo furiously insisted that it should be in fresco, and had the wall re-plastered in the rough \"arriccio\" needed as a base for fresco. It was on this occasion that he famously said that oil painting was \"an art for women and for leisurely and idle people like Fra Sebastiano\".\n\nThe new fresco required, unlike his Sistine Chapel ceiling, considerable destruction of existing art. There was an altarpiece of the Assumption of Mary by Pietro Perugino above the altar, for which a drawing survives in the Albertina, flanked by tapestries to designs by Raphael; these, of course, could just be used elsewhere. Above this zone, there were two paintings from the 15th-century cycles of Moses and Christ which still occupy the middle zone of the side walls. These were probably Perugino's \"Finding of Moses\" and the \"Adoration of the Kings\", beginning both cycles. Above them were the first of the series of standing popes in niches, including Saint Peter himself, probably as well as a Saint Paul and a central figure of Christ. Finally, the project required the destruction of two lunettes with the first two \"Ancestors of Christ\" from Michelangelo's own ceiling scheme. However, some of these works may have already been damaged by an accident in April 1525, when the altar curtains went on fire; the damage done to the wall is unclear.\nThe structure of the chapel, built in a great hurry in the 1470s, had given trouble from the start, with frequent cracks appearing. At Christmas in 1525 a Swiss Guard was killed when entering the chapel with the pope when the stone lintel to the doorway split and fell on him. The site is on sandy soil, draining a large area, and the preceding \"Great Chapel\" had had similar problems.\n\nThe new scheme for the altar wall and other changes necessitated by structural problems led to a loss of symmetry and \"continuity of window-rhythms and cornices\", as well as some of the most important parts of the previous iconographical schemes. As shown by drawings, the initial conception for the \"Last Judgement\" was to leave the existing altarpiece and work round it, stopping the composition below the frescos of Moses and Christ.\n\nThe Sistine Chapel was dedicated to the \"Assumption of the Virgin\", which had been the subject of Perugino's altarpiece. Once it was decided to remove this, it appears that a tapestry of the \"Coronation of the Virgin\", a subject often linked to the \"Assumption\", was commissioned, which was hung above the altar for important liturgical occasions in the 18th century, and perhaps from the 1540s until then. The tapestry has a vertical format (it is ), and is still in the Vatican Museums. A print of 1582 shows the chapel in use, with a large cloth of roughly this shape hanging behind the altar, and a canopy over it. The cloth is shown as plain, but the artist also omits the paintings below the ceiling, and may well not have been present himself, but working from prints and descriptions.\n\n\"The Last Judgment\" became controversial as soon as it was seen, with disputes between critics in the Catholic Counter-Reformation and supporters of the genius of the artist and the style of the painting. Michelangelo was accused of being insensitive to proper decorum, in respect of nudity and other aspects of the work, and of pursuing artistic effect over following the scriptural description of the event.\n\nOn a preview visit with Paul III, before the work was complete, the pope's Master of Ceremonies Biagio da Cesena is reported by Vasari as saying that: \"it was most disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures, exposing themselves so shamefully, and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather for the public baths and taverns\". Michelangelo immediately worked Cesena's face from memory into the scene as Minos, judge of the underworld (far bottom-right corner of the painting) with donkey ears (i.e. indicating foolishness), while his nudity is covered by a coiled snake. It is said that when Cesena complained to the Pope, the pontiff joked that his jurisdiction did not extend to Hell, so the portrait would have to remain. Pope Paul III himself was attacked by some for commissioning and protecting the work, and came under pressure to alter if not entirely remove the \"Last Judgement\", which continued under his successors.\n\nThe mixing of figures from pagan mythology into depictions of Christian subject matter was objected to. As well as the figures of Charon and Minos, and wingless angels, the very classicized Christ was objected to. Beardless Christs had in fact only finally disappeared from Christian art some four centuries earlier, but Michelangelo's figure was unmistakenly Apollonian.\n\nFurther objections related to failures to follow the scriptural references. The angels blowing trumpets are all in one group, whereas in the Book of Revelation they are sent to \"the four corners of the earth\". Christ is not seated on a throne, contrary to Scripture. Such draperies as Michelangelo painted are often shown as blown by wind, but it was claimed that all weather would cease on the Day of Judgement. The resurrected souls are in mixed condition, some skeletons but most appearing with their flesh intact. All these objections were eventually collected in a book, the \"Due Dialogi\" published just after Michelangelo's death in 1564, by the Dominican theologian Giovanni Andrea Gilio (da Fabriano), who had become one of several theologians policing art during and after the Council of Trent. As well as theological objections, Gilio objected to artistic devices like foreshortening that puzzled or distracted untrained viewers.\n\nTwo decades after the fresco was completed, the final session of the Council of Trent in 1563 finally enacted a form of words that reflected the Counter-Reformation attitudes to art that had been growing in strength in the Church for some decades. The Council's decree (drafted at the last minute and generally very short and inexplicit) reads in part : \n\nThere was an explicit decree that: \"The pictures in the Apostolic Chapel should be covered over, and those in other churches should be destroyed, if they display anything that is obscene or clearly false\".\n\nThe defences by Vasari and others of the painting evidently made some impact on clerical thinking. In 1573, when Paolo Veronese was summoned before the Venetian Inquisition to justify his inclusion of \"buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs, and other such absurdities\" in what was then called a painting of the Last Supper (later renamed as \"The Feast in the House of Levi\"), he tried to implicate Michelangelo in a comparable breach of decorum, but was promptly rebuffed by the inquisitors, as the transcript records:\nSome action to meet the criticism and enact the decision of the council had become inevitable, and the genitalia in the fresco were painted over with drapery by the Mannerist painter Daniele da Volterra, probably mostly after Michelangelo died in 1564. Daniele was \"a sincere and fervent admirer of Michelangelo\" who kept his changes to a minimum, and had to be ordered to go back and add more, and for his trouble got the nickname \"Il Braghettone\", meaning \"the breeches maker\". He also chiseled away and entirely repainted the larger part of Saint Catherine and the entire figure of Saint Blaise behind her. This was done because in the original version Blaise had appeared to look at Catherine's naked behind, and because to some observers the position of their bodies suggested sexual intercourse. The repainted version shows Blaise looking away from Saint Catherine, upward towards Christ.\n\nHis work, beginning in the upper parts of the wall, was interrupted when Pope Pius IV died in December 1565 and the chapel needed to be free of scaffolding for the funeral and conclave to elect the next pope. El Greco had made a helpful offer to repaint the entire wall with a fresco that was \"modest and decent, and no less well painted than the other\". Further campaigns of overpainting, often \"less discreet or respectful\", followed in later reigns, and \"the threat of total destruction ... re-surfaced in the pontificates of Pius V, Gregory XIII, and probably again of Clement VIII\". According to Anthony Blunt, \"rumours were current in 1936 that Pius XI intended to continue the work\". In total, nearly 40 figures had drapery added, apart from the two repainted. These additions were in \"dry\" fresco, which made them easier to remove in the most recent restoration (1990–94), when about 15 were removed, from those added after 1600. It was decided to leave 16th-century changes.\n\nAt a relatively early date, probably in the 16th century, a strip of about 18 inches was lost across the whole width of the bottom of the fresco, as the altar and its backing was modified.\n\nAs well as the criticism on moral and religious grounds, there was from the start considerable criticism based on purely aesthetic considerations, which had hardly been seen at all in initial reactions to Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling. Two key figures in the first wave of criticism were Pietro Aretino and his friend Lodovico Dolce, a prolific Venetian humanist. Aretino had made considerable efforts to become as close to Michelangelo as he was to Titian, but had always been rebuffed; \"in 1545 his patience gave way, and he wrote to Michelangelo that letter on the \"Last Judgement\" which is now famous as an example of insincere prudishness\", a letter written with a view to publication. Aretino had not in fact seen the finished painting, and based his criticisms on one of the prints that had been quickly brought to market. He \"purports to represent the simple folk\" in this new wider audience. However, it appears that at least the print-buying public preferred the uncensored version of the paintings, as most prints showed this well into the 17th century.\n\nVasari responded to this and other criticisms in the 1st edition of his \"Life of Michelangelo\" in 1550. Dolce followed up in 1557 with a published dialogue, \"L'Aretino\", almost certainly a collaborative effort with his friend. Many of the arguments of the theologian critics are repeated, but now in the name of decorum rather than religion, emphasizing that the particular and very prominent location of the fresco made the amount of nudity unacceptable; a convenient argument for Aretino, some of whose projects were frankly pornographic, but intended for private audiences. Dolce also complains that Michelangelo's female figures are hard to distinguish from males, and his figures show \"anatomical exhibitionism\"; criticisms many have echoed.\n\nOn these points, a long-lasting rhetorical comparison of Michelangelo and Raphael developed, in which even supporters such as Vasari participated. Raphael is held up as the exemplar of all the grace and decorum found lacking in Michelangelo, whose outstanding quality was called by Vasari his \"terribiltà\", the awesome, sublime or (the literal meaning) terror-inducing quality of his art. Vasari came to partly share this view by the time of the expanded 2nd edition of his \"Lives\", published in 1568, though he explicitly defended the fresco on several points raised by the attackers (without mentioning them), such as the decorum of the fresco, and \"amazing diversity of the figures\", and asserted it was \"directly inspired by God\", and a credit to the Pope and his \"future renown\".\n\nIn many respects, modern art historians discuss the same aspects of the work as 16th-century writers: the general grouping of the figures, and rendering of space and movement, the distinctive depiction of anatomy, the nudity and use of colour, and sometimes the theological implications of the fresco. However, Bernadine Barnes points out that no 16th-century critic echoes in the slightest the view of Anthony Blunt that: \"This fresco is the work of a man shaken out of his secure position, no longer at ease with the world, and unable to face it directly. Michelangelo does not now deal directly with the visible beauty of the physical world\". At the time, continues Barnes, \"it was censured as the work of an arrogant man, and it was justified as a work that made celestial figures more beautiful than natural\". Many other modern critics take similar lines to Blunt, like him emphasizing Michelangelo's \"tendency away from the material and towards the things of the spirit\" in his last decades.\n\nIn theology, the Second Coming of Christ ended space and time. Despite this, \"Michelangelo’s curious representation of space\", where \"the characters inhabit individual spaces that cannot be combined consistently\", is often commented on.\n\nQuite apart from the question of decorum, the rendering of anatomy has been often discussed. Writing of \"energy\" in the nude figure, Kenneth Clark has:\n\nThe twist into depth, the struggle to escape from the here and now of the picture plane, which had always distinguished Michelangelo from the Greeks, became the dominating rhythm of his later works. That colossal nightmare, the Last Judgement, is made up of such struggles. It is the most overpowering accumulation in all art of bodies in violent movement\"\n\nOf the figure of Christ, Clark says: \"Michelangelo has not tried to resist that strange compulsion which made him thicken a torso until it is almost square..\".\n\nS.J. Freedberg commented that \"The vast repertory of anatomies that Michelangelo conceived for the \"Last Judgement\" seems often to have been determined more by the requirements of art than by compelling needs of meaning ... meant not just to entertain but to overpower us with their effects. Often, too, the figures assume attitudes of which a major sense is one of ornament...\" He notes that the two frescos in the Cappella Paolina, Michelangelo's last paintings, begun in November 1542, almost immediately after the \"Last Judgement\", show from the start a major change in style, away from grace and aesthetic effect to an exclusive concern with illustrating the narrative, with no regard for beauty.\n\nEarly appreciations of the fresco had especially mentioned the colours, especially in small details, but over the centuries the build-up of dirt on the surface had largely hidden these. The built-out wall led to extra deposition of soot from candles on the altar. In 1953 (admittedly in November) Bernard Berenson put in his diary: \"The ceiling looks dark, gloomy. The \"Last Judgment\" even more so... how difficult to make up our minds that these Sistine frescoes are nowadays scarcely enjoyable in the original and much more so in photographs\".\n\nThe fresco was restored along with the Sistine vault between 1980 and 1994 under the supervision of Fabrizio Mancinelli, the curator of post-classical collections of the Vatican Museums and Gianluigi Colalucci, head restorer at the Vatican laboratory. During the course of the restoration, about half of the censorship of the \"Fig-Leaf Campaign\" was removed. Numerous pieces of buried details, caught under the smoke and grime of scores of years were revealed after the restoration. It was discovered that the fresco of Biagio de Cesena as Minos with donkey ears was being bitten in the genitalia by a coiled snake.\n\nMost writers agree that Michelangelo depicted his own face in the flayed skin of St. Bartholomew (see above). Edgar Wind saw this as \"a prayer for redemption, that through the ugliness of the outward man might be thrown off, and the inward man resurrected pure\", in a Neoplatonist mood, one that Aretino detected and objected to. One of Michelangelo's poems had used the metaphor of a snake shedding its old skin for his hope for a new life after his death.\n\nThe bearded figure of St. Bartholomew holding the skin was sometimes thought to have the features of Aretino, but open conflict between Michelangelo and Aretino did not occur until 1545, several years after the fresco's completion.\n\n\n\n"}

In the 1970s attendance decreased, and there were several attempts to find new uses for the building, culminating in 1989 in the construction of a short-lived amusement park, that resulted in the demolition of most of the theatre, except for the facade, entrance and foyer. The latter were restored during a 2004 reconstruction that converted the building into an arts centre, La Gaîté Lyrique, completed in November 2010.\n\nJacques Offenbach was the director of the Théâtre de la Gaîté from 1873 to 1874. His opéra-bouffe-féerie \"Le roi Carotte\" was first performed here in 1872 and his \"opéra-féerie\" \"Le voyage dans la lune\" in 1875. The opera \"Le timbre d'argent\" by Camille Saint-Saëns was premiered here in 1877, at which time the theatre was briefly known as the Théâtre National Lyrique.\n\n\nSerge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes danced at the theatre in 1921, 1923, and 1925. The 1921 performances included the ballerina Lydia Lopokova in the title role of Igor Stravinsky's \"The Firebird\", and the company gave premieres of Prokofiev's \"Chout\" (17 May 1921) and Stravinsky's \"Les noces\" (13 June 1923).\n\nBeginning on 15 November 1932 Franz Lehár's \"The Land of Smiles\" was first performed in France. It was given in a French adaptation by André Mauprey and Jean Marietti with the title \"Le pays du sourire\". The Dutch tenor Willy Thunis, who did not speak a word of French, sang Sou-Chong. The production received its 1,000th performance on 17 April 1939.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the theatre was looted during the occupation. The large chandelier installed by Offenbach disappeared, as well the Emperor's golden coach, which had been stored in the service quarters.\n\nAfter the war Henri Montjoye (né Barbero) took over the theatre, and after his death in 1950, his widow, the soprano Germaine Roger, became the theatre's director.\nNumerous successes were put on. The 2-act operetta \"Andalousie\" by Albert Willemetz and with music by had a 12-month run that began on 25 October 1947.\nThe 2-act \"Colorado\" by Claude Dufresne, billed as an \"opérette à grand spectacle\" with music by Jacques-Henry Rys and lyrics by , starred the bass Armand Mestral (who alternated with Michel Dens) in the role of Jim Bullit, the tenor Lou Pizzara as Ricardo Diaz, the soprano Claude Chenard as Katharina Sanders, and Maurice Baquet as the little saloon pianist. The show opened on 16 December 1950 and ran for 11 months. It was revived at the theatre beginning on 12 February 1959 with Mestral and Baquet reprising their roles and Bernard Alvi as Ricardo and Andrée Grandjean as Katharina. It later went on tour and received provincial productions up into the 1990s.\n\"Visa pour l'amour\", a vehicle for two of Paris's biggest musical comedy stars, the tenor Luis Mariano and the comedian Annie Cordy, was a 2-act \"opérette gaie\" with music by Lopez and a book by Vincy. It premiered in December 1961 and received around 600 performances.\n\nIn the 1970s the \"Carré Silvia-Monfort\" presented contemporary theatre, and some singers and a circus school, the Cirque Gruss, who offered their spectacles in the facing square, based themselves here for a time, and converted the attic of the theatre into stables for elephants.\n\nIn the early 1980s the dome of the main auditorium was threatening to collapse and was reinforced with concrete. In 1989 much of the theatre was demolished and transformed into an amusement park, , by Jean Chalopin. The main auditorium, originally holding 1800, and the orchestra pit, apparently large enough for 60 musicians, were among the parts of the building lost at this time. The venture was a failure and closed in 1991. Manuelle Gautrand, the architect who was in charge of the later restoration of the surviving parts of the theatre as well as the reconstruction and modernization of the demolished interior spaces, described the scene as follows: \"The historical foyer and the lobby had been stripped of their original style and had been redecorated with vulgar colors and statues\", and the amusement park itself was \"an incredible accumulation of monumental sets, combining pieced together dragons, rockets from the 80s, the world of Barbie, treasure hunts among the Incas…. A sort of 'low tech Disneyland' in the centre of Paris\".\n\nIn December 2003 restoration work began, and in December 2010 La Gaîté Lyrique was re-opened as a digital arts and modern music centre.\n\n\n"}

It was built in 1889 by architect Édouard-Jean Niermans and then taken over by two brothers, Émile Isola and Vincent Isola, in 1892 to become the Théâtre Isola. They managed the theatre until 1897.\n\nBerthez Armand was an early director and the actress-dancer Gaby Deslys (1881-1920) appeared there. The actress, singer and film star Arletty made her debut there in October 1919 and performed there regularly for ten years, especially in operettas. It was also the venue of the 1941 musical comedy \"Une femme par jour\", (with music by Georges Van Parys and text by Pierre Véber and Jean Boyer). Serge Gainsbourg inaugurated a series of popular concerts at the theatre in 1963, including an appearance by the singer Barbara.\n\nThe theatre finally in 1970 and was taken over by the perfume company Fragonard which has preserved the building as a perfume museum, the Théâtre-Musée des Capucines.\n\n\n\n"}

The song was released as the lead single from their sixth studio album of the same name in 1977. The music was written by Ralf Hütter, and the lyrics by Hütter and Emil Schult. The track is ostensibly about the Trans Europ Express rail system, with technology and transport both being common themes in Kraftwerk's oeuvre.\n\nThe track has since found further influence, both in hip-hop by its interpolation by Afrika Bambaata (via Arthur Baker) on \"Planet Rock\", which has been sampled and remixed by many different artists such as Paul Oakenfold for \"Swordfish\"'s soundtrack, and by modern experimental bands such as the electroclash bands of the early 2000s.\n\n\"Trans-Europe Express\" was released as a single in 1977, and charted in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, where it peaked at number 67. \"Trans-Europe Express\" as a single did not chart in the UK although reached number one in France.\n\nAllmusic described the musical elements of the suite as having a haunting theme with \"deadpan chanting of the title phrase\" which is \"slowly layered over that rhythmic base in much the same way that the earlier \"Autobahn\" was constructed\". The song's lyrics reference the album \"Station to Station\" and meeting with musicians Iggy Pop and David Bowie. Hütter and Schneider had previously met up with Bowie in Germany and were flattered with the attention they received from him. Ralf Hütter was interested in Bowie's work as he had been working with Iggy Pop, who was the former lead singer of the Stooges; one of Hütter's favorite groups.\n\nThe song was also recorded and released in a German language version under the title \"Trans Europa Express\" both as a single in edited form and on the German language version of the album of the same name. The lyrics are a literal translation of the English language version although it is not known which came first.\n\nA new version of \"Trans Europe Express\" was included on the 1991 album The Mix. This version is considerably shorter than the original and omits the verse about David Bowie and Iggy Pop. It also segues directly into the tracks \"Abzug\" and \"Metal on Metal\", although the fusion with the former makes \"Trans Europe Express\" closer to the original in duration. A German language version of the track was also included on the German release of \"The Mix\".\n\nThe track has often featured in Kraftwerk's live sets and a live version of the \"Trans Europe Express / Abzug / Metal on Metal\" suite recorded at Riga Olimpiska Hall in 2004 is included on the group's live album Minimum-Maximum.\n\n"}

It is generally a touring exhibition held in various places in Western Norway. Artists associated with the region are eligible to take part.\nThe Western Norway Exhibition has been an important venue for artists from the region ever since it started in 1922. The exhibition is a cooperative effort between the Kube Art Museum in Ålesund, the Kabuso Art Gallery in Øystese, the Sunnfjord Art Association in Førde, the Haugesund Art Gallery, and the Stavanger Art Association. Financial support is provided by the counties of Rogaland, Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane, and Møre og Romsdal, as well as the Arts Council of Norway.\n\nIn addition to the Western Norway Exhibition, there are four other annual regional art exhibitions: the Eastern Norway Exhibition (\"Østlandsutstillingen\"), the Southern Norway Exhibition (\"Sørlandsutstillingen\"), the Central Norway Exhibition (\"Den midtnorske kunstutstilling\"), and the Northern Norway Exhibition (\"Den Nord-Norske Kunstutstilling\"). The exhibitions vary in how they are organized.\n\nThe Western Norway Exhibition was held for the first time in 1922. The initiative for it came from Axel Revold and the art historian Einar Lexow or, according to a 1975 newspaper article, from the artistic milieu in Stavanger, in which artists in the town met regularly at Harry Landås's apartment, where the discussion at one point turned to the Autumn Exhibition and Olav Ansgar Larsen suggested setting up their own exhibition for Western Norway. After the idea developed further, Larsen got in touch with Nils Krantz in Bergen, and the idea then became a reality.\n\nIn 1926, painters from Trøndelag were invited to participate, but this only occurred once. The exhibition has been held annually since 1928, with participants coming from the four counties of Western Norway.\n\nThe point of departure for the exhibition in 2011 was the short story \"Rom for sten og hjort\" (Space for Rock and Deer) by Tormod Haugland. The artistic coordinators were Karolin Tampere and Johanne Nordby Wernø.\n\nThe theme of the exhibition in 2012 was motion, and the exhibition was curated by Annemari Skeide.\n\n"}
