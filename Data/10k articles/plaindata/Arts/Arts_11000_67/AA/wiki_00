Originally painted at the Church of Santa María d’Àneu (La Guingueta d’Àneu, Lleida)\n\nThe church of Santa María d'Àneu is located in the upper valley of the Noguera Pallaresa, Pyrenees mountain region. The building once belonged to a Benedictine Monastery, it is divided into a nave and aisles by six pairs of piers, taking the shape of a cross. The east end concludes in three semicircular apses, the central apse was decorated with frescoes.\n\nSanta Maria in Àneu was the most important church in the Àneu Valley and belonged to the cathedral chapter of Urgell. From the stylistic circle of Pedret, of Lombardic influence, the decoration of the apse reveals the existence of an elaborate iconographic and theological programme setting off the prophetic hopes of the Old Testament—that is, hope in the coming of a Messiah who was to redeem humanity—against fulfillment of the prophecies—that is, the coming of the Messiah announced by the prophets. Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya dates the original work at the end of 11th century – beginning of 12th century. However, there is speculation that the paintings were completed at the beginning of the 13th century at the time when Romanesque styles were breaking down and Gothic Art was coming of age.\n\nThe iconography of the painting is suggestive of the Old Testament through the presence of the prophets in reverential attitudes. In the vault portion of the apse, the Epiphany or Adoration of the Magi is represented, with Mary, Jesus, and the three eastern kings baring gifts. Wheels of fire from Jehovah’s chariot are depicted in the lower register, conforming to Ezekiel’s vision. To the right and left are the archangels Michael and Gabriel holding banners and scrolls with the inscription PETICIVS and POSTVLATIVS. Bordering the central window of the lower zones are two six-winged seraphim, in their hands they hold live coals with tongs which they place in the mouths of two crouching figures. In the left lower zone, there are two tonsured (meaning scalp has been shaved) figures who might be Saints Benedict and Bernard or one of them might be a portrait of a local deacon on account of the realism in the face of the figure. The theory that these figures are patrons of the church is strengthened by the discovery of similar figures in related frescoes at the monastery of Saint Peter of Berga. The third archangel, Raphael, does not appear with the others in the semidome but in the lower section.\n\nAt the bottom is the announcement, the biblical prophecy, represented by means of combined images of the visions of Isaiah and Ezequiel. In keeping with the first, two magnificent seraphim with three pairs of wings each purify the mouth of the\nprophets with glowing embers which they are holding with tongs. Next to them are the prophets, represented with their hands together in an attitude of reverence.\n\nAt the same time, the seraphim intone the Trisagion, or song of praise to the Lord, represented by the letters SCS, SCS, SCS, which mean ‘holy, holy, holy’. From this moment, the word of the prophets will be the word of God. Beneath the central\nwindow are the wheels of fire of Yahweh’s chariot, described in Ezequiel’s vision, which symbolise the presence of the Lord. On the vault was the Virgin and Child, representing the accomplishment of the prophecies, in the scene from Epiphany,\nwith two archangels, Michael and Gabriel, patrons of sinners, in a representation very similar to that in the apse from Santa Maria in Cap d'Aran (The Cloisters, New York). A third archangel, Raphael, is represented on the right of the semicylinder,\nperhaps as the introducer of the two donor clergymen who appear on the left of the apse.\n\nThe frescoes are attributed to the Circle of the Master of Pedret. The Master of Pedret was the first significant painter of the Catalon Romanesque period and is named for the wall paintings at the church of San Quirze de Pedret in Berga. The Apse at Aneu represents the end of a tradition, during this time the painter might have felt himself at liberty to relax old rules and abandon strict division into zones, therefore filling the bottom section not with lines of Apostles, but with less rigid elements of the prophetic vision.\n\nThe Àneu frescos make a complete break with the normal Catalan artistic scheme. The lower zone is unique and unrelated to the upper portion of the apse. The Byzantine influence appears to be strong in the style of the frescos, the seraphim have been noted to resemble those in the crypt at the cathedral of Anagni, near Rome. In addition there are touches of pure realism, this is seen in the details such as the unshaven face of the figure at the left of the lower register and the thin and deeply wrinkled face of Magus. The painting could represent direct borrowings from Byzantium or importations from Byzantine Art via Lombardy, Italy. This influence is shown in the costume of the Wise Men (or Maji) which is representative of the eastern court. Other features linking the artwork to Italy are the decorative border, simulated drapery (they have waves and circular medallions), and the geometrical border is similar to the one in the Roman church of San Carlo in Prugiasco (Switzerland).\n\n\n"}

Most probably, Athanaric's Wall has reused the old Roman \"limes\" called Limes Transalutanus.\n\nHistorian Theodore Mommsen wrote that Romans built a defensive wall from the Danube delta to Tyras. He wrote:\n\nThe structure is made of earthen walls and palisades, with an elevation of only three meters (which is mostly eroded away).\n\nIt stretches from Romania Buciumeni-Tiganesti-Tapu to Stoicani and after that it enters Moldova. In southern Moldova, it stretches another 126 km from the village of Vadul lui Isac in the Cahul District by the Prut River, and then goes into Ukraine ending at Lake Sasyk by Tatarbunar.\n\nSome historians think that the southern Trajan Wall reached the city of Tyras, when was annexed by emperor Nero. Indeed, a Roman bronze coin was found during excavations that discovered evidences of the original construction in the first century\n\nIn the 19th century the coat of arms of the Cahul \"uyezd\" of Bessarabia, Russian Empire, incorporated the image of \"Trajan's Wall\".\n\nSome academics such as Dorel Bondoc think that the wall was built by the Romans, because it required a great deal of knowledge and a workforce that barbarians like Athanaric did not have.\n\nBondoc wrote that \"[The Wall's] huge size means the need of considerable material and human resources, a condition that could be met only by the Roman Empire ... the period of time when it was built stretched from Constantine the Great to Valentinian I and Valens\".\nSome scholars, like Vasile Nedelciuc, argue that the turf Wall was built initially by the Romans during Nero rule from the Prut river to Tyras, even because it has a ditch facing north. He argues that later it was enlarged by Athanaric, but only until Sasyk lagoon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24298967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24298967", "title": "Australian design law", "text": "Australian design law\n\nThe Commonwealth of Australia's \"Designs Act 2003\" replaced the \"Designs Act 1906\". The legislation assists in the protection of the overall appearance of a product resulting from one or more visual features of the product. Although there are some overlaps, the Designs Act is not applicable when defending the functional innovations of a product. In common law, \"Firmagroup Australia Pty Ltd v Byrne & Davidson Doors\" (1987) 180 CLR 483, supports this. Firmagroup Australia Pty registered a design for a ‘combination handle and lock for shutter doors’. The innovative product was copied by Byrne & Davidson, and Firmagroup sued for infringement on design. The High Court held that the ‘combination handle and lock for shutter doors’ was ‘an idea of shape or configuration’, which is ‘conveyed by those features’, was ‘too general to attract statutory protection’. The Court then restricted the monopoly to the specific, individual appearance. Further, it added that ‘No design should be so construed as to give to its proprietor a monopoly in a method or principle of construction.’ The defendant proved to distinguish his product adequately, and thus did not infringe on Firmagroup’s design.\n\nUnder the legislation, a design, in relation to a product, means the overall appearance of the product resulting from one or more visual features of the product. Further, the design is only a design, for the purposes of the Designs Act, when it is used in relation to the registered product. This illustrates that the registration of the design does not protect the business against the same design being used on other products; the pattern itself cannot be registered. In addition, the act covers both, two-dimensional designs (such as a logo on a cup), and three-dimensional designs (such as the shape of the cup). Furthermore, Dixon J, in \"Macrae Knitting Mills Ltd v Lowes Ltd\" (1936) 55 CLR 725, confirms that ‘The Act is concerned with shape and configuration, not function’. The Act, stipulates that a visual feature may, but need not, serve a functional purpose. However, if the design’s every visual feature serves a functional purpose, then common law states that the design is not registrable.\n\nFurthermore, the Designs Act states that should an innovation be both, a visual feature, and serve a functional purpose, there is nothing to stop the design being registered.\n\nIn common law, \"British Franco Electric Pty Ltd v Dowling Plastics Pty Ltd\" [1981] NSWLR 448, reinforces the view the courts take on the distinction between a function and a design. In the case, both companies entered into a business selling and manufacturing furniture castors. Dowling Plastics developed the castor, and British Franco registered the design. Soon after the joint venture broke up, Dowling Plastics continued the production of the castors. However, British Franco claimed that Dowling Plastics were infringing on British Franco’s registered design. Dowling put forth an argument questioning the validity of the registration of the design, as the only novel feature of the castor served a functional purpose, and when the castor is assembled, the design would not be seen. The court held in favour of Dowling, however, they were not persuaded by the business’s argument, ruling that the functional purpose of the article is irrelevant, when the design does not satisfy other requirements for registration.\n\nThe act outlines, that a product is a thing that is manufactured or handmade. Further, even if a component part of a product is made separately from the product itself, for the purposes of the Designs Act, it is still a product. Even a kit made for assembly of a particular product, is that product.\n\nWhen the issue came to designs that vary in their dimensions (such as roof guttering), the items are still considered products, as long as following conditions apply:\n\nOne of the deep-seated aspects of the Designs Act is the distinction between the idea of a product, and the design relating to that product. Thus, the designs act will not grant a monopoly to a business attempting to register a fundamental or essential form of a product.\nThis is supported by common law, in \"Dalgety Australia Operations Ltd v Seeley Nominees Pty Ltd\" (1985) 5 IPR 97, when the High Court held that the Designs Act does not give a monopoly to the trading of the article to which it is applied. For example, without a design, a chair would still be a chair, a fork would still be a fork, etc.… Bollen, J, further clarified that \na design\nturns a chair into something more than a mere chair. It becomes a chair with a conception or suggestion about shape or configuration beyond the fundamental form of a chair\nThus, the case established that a fundamental form cannot be registered as a design.\n\nThe Designs Act also caters for components and spare parts of a product. The Act provides a monopoly for a component part of a product, which it deems to be a product for the purposes of the act.\nHowever, The Designs Act does not provide clarity when the issue is regarding a fundamental nature of components and spare parts. It is deep-seated in legislation and common law, that if a product is a fundamental form or shape of a product, then the product cannot be registrable. Although the spare part is purely manufactured for the purpose of attaching to its larger counterpart, it is not clear if that is seen, by legislation and common law, as being dictated by a functional purpose. Further, in most cases, the designer of the spare part also had a number of potential shapes to choose from, thus the spare part cannot be the fundamental form, thus rendering the product registrable.\n\nThe design is registrable if it fits the following characteristics:\n\nAfter registration, the owner of the registered design owns a renewable monopoly for 5 years, and has the exclusive rights to :\n\nA person infringes a registered design if, during the term of registration of the design, and without the licence or authority of the registered owner of the design, the person:\n\nIn subsection (a), the section mentions a design that is identical to, or substantially similar in overall impression. While the test for the design being identical is uncomplicated, to determine whether the design is substantially similar in overall impression and how it is substantially similar, the act refers to s19. The section stipulates that the court pay more attention to the similarities rather than the differences, must have regard for prior art base, and contextualize a certain part of the design that is similar, in relation to the whole design. The court must then apply the standard of a person who is familiar with the product to which the design relates, or products similar to the product to which the design relates.\nThe Act does not require any party to establish that the registered design was copied, the mere registration of the design, protects against independent creation.\n\nIf the defendant is repairing a complex product that has at least two replaceable component parts, permitting disassembly and re-assembly, then they may claim a defence under s72 of the Act, on the condition that the repair is for the purpose of restoring the complex products’ overall appearance. Further, the onus of proof is on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant knew, or ought reasonably to have known that the use of authorisation was not for the permitted purpose.\n\n"}
{"id": "13707411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13707411", "title": "Barnenez", "text": "Barnenez\n\nThe Cairn of Barnenez (also: Barnenez Tumulus, Barnenez Mound etc.; in Breton \"Karn Barnenez\"; in French: \"Cairn de Barnenez\" or \"Tumulus de Barnenez\") is a Neolithic monument located near Plouezoc'h, on the Kernéléhen peninsula in northern Finistère, Brittany (France). It dates to the early Neolithic, about 4800 BC; it is considered one of the earliest megalithic monuments in Europe, as well as one of the oldest man-made structures in the world,\nalong with the Tumulus of Bougon and Locmariaquer megaliths, also located in Great West France. It is also remarkable for the presence of megalithic art.\n\nRadiocarbon dates indicate that the first phase of the monument was erected between 4850 and 4250 BC, and the second phase between 4450 and 4000 BC.\n\nPottery found in and around the monument indicates that it underwent a period of reuse in the Bronze Age, in the 3rd millennium BC.\n\nThe cairn was first mapped in 1807, in the context of the Napoleonic cadaster. Its first scientific recognition took place in the context of an academic congress in Morlaix in 1850, when it was classified as a tumulus.\n\nPrivately owned until the 1950s, the cairn was used as a quarry for paving stones. This activity, which threatened to destroy the monument, was only halted after the discovery of several of its chambers in the 1950s. The local community then took control of the site.\n\nThe cairn was restored between 1954 and 1968. At the same time, vegetation was removed from the mound and systematic excavation took place in and around the monument.\n\nToday, the Barnenez cairn is 72 m long, up to 25 m wide and over 8 m high. It is built of 13,000 to 14,000 tons of stone. It contains 11 chambers entered by separate passages. The mound has steep facades and a stepped profile. Several internal walls either represent earlier facades or served the stability of the structure. The cairn consists of relatively small blocks of stone, with only the chambers being truly megalithic in character.\nThe monument overlooks the Bay of Morlaix, probably a fertile coastal plain at the time of its erection.\nThe monument is the result of at least two phases of building.\n\nIn a first phase, a slightly trapezoidal mound of 32 m by 9 to 13 m was erected. It contained 5 chambers and was surrounded by a double kerb. The first phase favoured the use of dolerite.\n\nIn a second phase, an extension with six further chambers was added in the west. At the same time, Cairn 1 was enveloped in a wider and taller structure; its passages had to be extended. More granite was used in this phase.\n\nThe 11 chambers of the Barnenez cairn are of the type known as \"Dolmen à couloir\" in French archaeological terminology. The term translates roughly as \"passage grave\". They are built of large slabs of slate and granite. Originally, all the chambers were entirely enclosed by the mound. The fact that several of them are partially exposed now is the result of modern quarrying.\n\nEach of the 11 chambers is reached from the southeast via a long narrow passage (7–12 m long). They are arranged parallel to each other. Shapes and construction techniques differ slightly.\nIn nine cases, narrow passages lead to corbelled chambers. Normally, the corbel vault rests on orthostats, in one chamber it actually sits on the ground, forming a true \"tholos\". The passages have slab-built or dry stone walls and are covered with slabs. One of the chambers has a dry-stone vaulted ante-chamber.\n\nOne cubic metre of the Barnenez cairn contains 1,500 kg of stone. It is estimated that the quarrying, fashioning, transport and construction of such an amount represents about four work days for a single worker (assuming a 10-hour day). The original monument, Cairn 1, had a volume of about 2,000 cubic metres; it is built of 1,000 tons of granite and 3,000 tons of dolerite. It would thus have required 15,000 to 20,000 working days; in other words, it would have taken 200 workers three months to erect Cairn 1 alone. In its final form, the Barnenez mound is nearly three times as big as the first phase.\n\nEngraved symbols occur in several of the chambers and passages. They depict bows, axes, wave symbols or snakes and a repeated U-shaped sign. One of the carved slabs is in secondary use was originally part of a different structure, an interesting parallel to the situation in several other such monuments, including Gavrinis. \nThe symbols on the engraved blocks resemble those found in other megalithic monuments in Brittany; in broader terms they belong to the cultural phenomenon described as megalithic art. One of the recurring symbols is sometimes interpreted as an anthropomorphic depiction (the so-called \"Dolmen Goddess\").\n\nOnly Cairn 2, namely chambers A, C and D, contained Neolithic finds at the time of excavation. They included pottery, polished stone axes (of dolerite), flint blades and arrowheads.\n\nPottery shards found outside the monument indicate that it was reused in the Bronze Age (3rd millennium BC). A copper dagger and a barbed arrowhead are of Chalcolithic date.\n\nSimilar, possibly contemporary, monuments are known at 22 other locations in France and on Jersey. Breton examples are Larcuste-Colpo, Le Bono, Petit Mont, Ty-Floc´h, Gavrinis, Île Carn, Ploudalmézeau and Guennoc (I´ile Gaignoc – sometimes spelt Guénioc) off the shore at Landéda. Those located on islands are generally better preserved. Chamber 3 B at Guennoc contains a small standing stone near the entrance.\n\nAn exhibition in the modern entrance building explains the results of scientific excavation and displays some objects from the site.\n\n\n\n"}

It highlights the Black Canadian experience and to promote awareness about the complexities of contemporary Black youth experience in Ontario.\n\nThe book consists of a foreword by the President of the Ontario Black History Society, Rosemary Sadlier, OOnt and work by various youth on issues of identity, belonging, and Canadian Black History.\n\nThe anthology was created in partnership with the Office of the Provincial Advocate of Children and Youth in Ontario a commission of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario which puts youth at its centre and uses rights to improve the lives and conditions of youth in systems of care in Ontario. The anthology was started in January 2012 and was published by General Store Publishing House in July 2012.\n\nThe title \"Basodee\" comes from the Trinidadian creole word of the same name meaning \"half-conscious\" and \"disoriented.\" The term was chosen as the title of the book to express the confusion and identity crisis of Black Canadian youth.\n\nThe book consists of photography, essays, short stories and poetry by 13 youth expressing what it is to be young, Black and Canadian. Many are immigrants to the country or first-generation Canadians. Some have had experience with the mental health or criminal justice system and some are in care. Each shares their personal stories and views on what it means to be Black and Canadian today.\n\n\"Basodee\" makes its debut at a time when concern about escalating gun violence in the City of Toronto such as the shooting at the Toronto Eaton Centre on June 2, 2012 and in Scarborough on July 16, 2012 has resulted in statements by Toronto Mayor Rob Ford that he wishes to force individuals convicted of a gun charge out of the city and more money from the province during a 'gun summit' for \"anti-crime\" initiatives such as the Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy (TAVIS) which places increased police presence in priority neighbourhoods.\n\nIn response to the July 16 shooting, the Toronto Star published a cartoon by Michael de Adder cartoon depicting a little black girl's alleged \"expected\" injuries before the age of two -\"boo boo from highchair, mark from tricycle, and head laceration from a medium-caliber bullet.\" After numerous complaints the Star apologized for the cartoon's insensitivity to the complex issues at play in gun violence. It is media sanctioned expressions of negative stereotypes like these that \"Basodee\" tries to fight, using the voices of many of the youth these stereotypes and top-down solutions attempt to silence.\n\nWhen many expressions of a voice other than the mainstream Canadian voice are being squelched and co-opted, such as \"Sway Magazine\" or Caribana due to economic considerations and a clear climate of devaluation of diversity, the Basodee collective comes together to bring true diversity back to the Canadian cultural milieu and show youth commitment to celebrations such as Black History Month, which are often seen as outdated and unnecessary in a post-racial \"multicultural\" society such as Toronto. Michael de Adder and Rob Ford's comments and many of the pieces in \"Basodee\", however, prove that Toronto is very much a race conscious city and is no where near embracing multiculturalism as many have been publicly threatened by the chief city official with exile.\n\nSome of the major themes in \"Basodee\" include identity, struggle and belonging. The book argues that part of the \"basodeeness\" of Black youth stems from \"mis-education\" about their history. The term \"mis-education\" is borrowed from Carter G. Woodson's book The Mis-Education of the Negro. \"Basodee\" contains essays outlining the history of discrimination in the Canadian education system against Blacks and the present struggle for solutions to this ongoing discrimination such as the establishment of the Africentric Alternative School.\n\nThe book also contains an essay tracing a history of Canadian human rights abuses against Blacks extending into the present day. \"Basodee\" argues that this history which is seldom spoken about form a major part of Black youth's basodeness. When many Black youth feel that dropping out of school and turning to a life of crime are the only way to protect themselves from discrimination and secure against mainstream attempts to erode their identity.\n\nGiven this real struggle of Black youth to safeguard their identity, the main thesis of \"Basodee\" is that Black youth in Canada have not been given a place of belonging in Canadian society, despite being here for generations and even since the time of slavery. Thus, the book presents examples from its contributors of how to find that identity – such as remembering where you came from, the struggles you have gone through, and undergoing negrescence.\n\nThe collective hopes that \"Basodee\" will one day become a resource to Black youth struggling to find themselves in the midst of media stereotypes, threats of exile, and stigmatization. In partnering with the Office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, the collective hopes to get the book in the hands of youth in the system who need the ideas it explores the most – Crown wards, youth in detention centres, and youth in care. The collective is currently looking for more organizations that work with Black youth as part of their mandate to share the book and also partner with in the future.\n\nBlack Canadians\n\n"}

After being retired for four years, Flatley announced he was going to tour with a new show. In the summer of 2004 Flatley started the rehearsals of a new show in the SFX Theatre in Dublin, Ireland.

Brock's wife, a \"half caste\" Chinese Eurasian named \"Lucky Legs\" (Angie Dickinson) who resorts to smuggling to feed her five-year-old son (Warren Hsieh) she had with Brock. Brock abandoned her and the baby when he was born with Asian features, feeling a \"half breed\" would not be welcome in America; an attitude towards miscegenation prevalent at the time. Lucky is recruited by the French high command to use her expert knowledge of the area and her friendship with the communist Major Cham (Lee Van Cleef) to get a demolition squad of Legionnaires led by Brock to a vital hidden Viet Minh ammunition dump on the border with Red China. In return for her services, Lucky is promised by the French that they will arrange for her son's emigration to America.\n\nThe raid is filled with animosity between the former lovers, booby traps, and enemy patrols. On arrival at the ammunition dump hidden in a mountain, Lucky discovers the commanding officer is her former friend Major Cham, who wants to take her and her son to a new life in Moscow. Cham is a high flyer corporate executive (in the manner of Fuller's gangsters in \"Underworld USA\") marked for great things in the world of international communism. The sabotage mission is successful but at great cost; Lucky dies blowing up the dump. Brock reconciles with his child and is last seen walking along holding his hand in preparation for returning to America, as Goldie reprises the title song.\n\nFuller selected singer Cole after being impressed with his face on a record album cover. Though Darryl F. Zanuck said Cole received more money in a few weeks than the entire budget of the film, Fuller arranged to meet Cole. Cole and his wife were interested in Goldie as an opposite to the racist Brock and agreed to work at a minimum salary. \"China Gate\" was the last score Victor Young composed; the film was finished by his friend Max Steiner. Harold Adamson wrote lyrics to Young's beautiful theme for the film. Though originally not intending to sing in the film, Cole sang \"China Gate\" as he walked through a bombed out village followed by Brock's little son, making it a memorable tune and a fitting tribute to Young.\n\nAn actual Eurasian actress playing a love interest opposite a white European star was a rarity in Hollywood at the time. Dickinson proves attractive to Brock, and to mainstream audiences of the time. Her character is allowed to express Fuller's view on race relations and is respected both by the French military and by a local priest whose life she had saved. (The character takes a role similar to Fuller's prostitute protagonists in \"Pickup on South Street\" and \"The Naked Kiss\"). The dangerous patrol allows for a gradual change of heart for Brock.\n\nBefore \"China Gate\" was to be released, Fuller received a call from the French Consul-General in Los Angeles, Romain Gary, inviting him to lunch. Gary said the film's prologue was too harsh towards France and asked Fuller to change it. Fuller refused, but the two became firm friends with similar interests. The film was never released in France.\n\nMany years later, Fuller filmed a story of Gary's, \"White Dog\" (1982), that Fuller and Curtis Hanson adapted for the screen.\n\n\"China Gate\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc by Mongrel Media on March 26, 2013.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1979078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1979078", "title": "Color model", "text": "Color model\n\nA color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers, typically as three or four values or color components. When this model is associated with a precise description of how the components are to be interpreted (viewing conditions, etc.), the resulting set of colors is called \"color space.\" This section describes ways in which human color vision can be modeled.\n\nOne can picture this space as a region in three-dimensional Euclidean space if one identifies the \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\" axes with the stimuli for the long-wavelength (\"L\"), medium-wavelength (\"M\"), and short-wavelength (\"S\") light receptors. The origin, (\"S\",\"M\",\"L\") = (0,0,0), corresponds to black. White has no definite position in this diagram; rather it is defined according to the color temperature or white balance as desired or as available from ambient lighting. The human color space is a horse-shoe-shaped cone such as shown here (see also CIE chromaticity diagram below), extending from the origin to, in principle, infinity. In practice, the human color receptors will be saturated or even be damaged at extremely high light intensities, but such behavior is not part of the CIE color space and neither is the changing color perception at low light levels (see: Kruithof curve). \nThe most saturated colors are located at the outer rim of the region, with brighter colors farther removed from the origin. As far as the responses of the receptors in the eye are concerned, there is no such thing as \"brown\" or \"gray\" light. The latter color names refer to orange and white light respectively, with an intensity that is lower than the light from surrounding areas. One can observe this by watching the screen of an overhead projector during a meeting: one sees black lettering on a white background, even though the \"black\" has in fact not become darker than the white screen on which it is projected before the projector was turned on. The \"black\" areas have not actually become darker but appear \"black\" relative to the higher intensity \"white\" projected onto the screen around it. See also color constancy.\n\nThe human tristimulus space has the property that additive mixing of colors corresponds to the adding of vectors in this space. This makes it easy to, for example, describe the possible colors (gamut) that can be constructed from the red, green, and blue primaries in a computer display.\n\nOne of the first mathematically defined color spaces is the CIE XYZ color space (also known as CIE 1931 color space), created by the International Commission on Illumination in 1931. These data were measured for human observers and a 2-degree field of view. In 1964, supplemental data for a 10-degree field of view were published.\n\nNote that the tabulated sensitivity curves have a certain amount of arbitrariness in them. The shapes of the individual X, Y and Z sensitivity curves can be measured with a reasonable accuracy. However, the overall luminosity function (which in fact is a weighted sum of these three curves) is subjective, since it involves asking a test person whether two light sources have the same brightness, even if they are in completely different colors. Along the same lines, the relative magnitudes of the X, Y, and Z curves are arbitrarily chosen to produce equal areas under the curves. One could as well define a valid color space with an X sensitivity curve that has twice the amplitude. This new color space would have a different shape. The sensitivity curves in the CIE 1931 and 1964 xyz color space are scaled to have equal areas under the curves.\n\nSometimes XYZ colors are represented by the luminance, Y, and chromaticity coordinates \"x\" and \"y\", defined by:\n\nMathematically, \"x\" and \"y\" are projective coordinates and the colors of the chromaticity diagram occupy a region of the real projective plane. Because the CIE sensitivity curves have equal areas under the curves, light with a flat energy spectrum corresponds to the point (\"x\",\"y\") = (0.333,0.333).\n\nThe values for \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" are obtained by integrating the product of the spectrum of a light beam and the published color-matching functions.\n\nMedia that transmit light (such as television) use additive color mixing with primary colors of red, green, and blue, each of which stimulates one of the three types of the eye's color receptors with as little stimulation as possible of the other two. This is called \"RGB\" color space. Mixtures of light of these primary colors cover a large part of the human color space and thus produce a large part of human color experiences. This is why color television sets or color computer monitors need only produce mixtures of red, green and blue light. See Additive color.\n\nOther primary colors could in principle be used, but with red, green and blue the largest portion of the human color space can be captured. Unfortunately there is no exact consensus as to what loci in the chromaticity diagram the red, green, and blue colors should have, so the same RGB values can give rise to slightly different colors on different screens.\n\nIt is possible to achieve a large range of colors seen by humans by combining cyan, magenta, and yellow transparent dyes/inks on a white substrate. These are the \"subtractive\" primary colors. Often a fourth ink, black, is added to improve reproduction of some dark colors. This is called the \"CMY\" or \"CMYK\" color space.\n\nThe cyan ink absorbs red light but transmits green and blue, the magenta ink absorbs green light but transmits red and blue, and the yellow ink absorbs blue light but transmits red and green. The white substrate reflects the transmitted light back to the viewer. Because in practice the CMY inks suitable for printing also reflect a little bit of color, making a deep and neutral black impossible, the K (black ink) component, usually printed last, is needed to compensate for their deficiencies. Use of a separate black ink is also economically driven when a lot of black content is expected, e.g. in text media, to reduce simultaneous use of the three colored inks. The dyes used in traditional color photographic prints and slides are much more perfectly transparent, so a K component is normally not needed or used in those media.\nA number of color models exist in which colors are fit into conic, cylindrical or spherical shapes, with neutrals running from black to white in a central axis, and hues corresponding to angles around that axis. Arrangements of this type date back to the 18th century, and continue to be developed in the most modern and scientific models.\n\nDifferent color theorists have each designed unique color solids. Many are in the shape of a sphere, whereas others are warped three-dimensional ellipsoid figures—these variations being designed to express some aspect of the relationship of the colors more clearly. The color spheres conceived by Phillip Otto Runge and Johannes Itten are typical examples and prototypes for many other color solid schematics. The models of Runge and Itten are basically identical, and form the basis for the description below.\n\nPure, saturated hues of equal brightness are located around the equator at the periphery of the color sphere. As in the color wheel, contrasting (or complementary) hues are located opposite each other. Moving toward the center of the color sphere on the equatorial plane, colors become less and less saturated, until all colors meet at the central axis as a neutral gray. Moving vertically in the color sphere, colors become lighter (toward the top) and darker (toward the bottom). At the upper pole, all hues meet in white; at the bottom pole, all hues meet in black. \n\nThe vertical axis of the color sphere, then, is gray all along its length, varying from black at the bottom to white at the top. All pure (saturated) hues are located on the surface of the sphere, varying from light to dark down the color sphere. All impure (unsaturated hues, created by mixing contrasting colors) comprise the sphere's interior, likewise varying in brightness from top to bottom.\n\nHSL and HSV are both cylindrical geometries, with hue, their angular dimension, starting at the red primary at 0°, passing through the green primary at 120° and the blue primary at 240°, and then wrapping back to red at 360°. In each geometry, the central vertical axis comprises the \"neutral\", \"achromatic\", or \"gray\" colors, ranging from black at lightness 0 or value 0, the bottom, to white at lightness 1 or value 1, the top.\n\nMost televisions, computer displays, and projectors produce colors by combining red, green, and blue light in varying intensities—the so-called RGB additive primary colors. However, the relationship between the constituent amounts of red, green, and blue light and the resulting color is unintuitive, especially for inexperienced users, and for users familiar with subtractive color mixing of paints or traditional artists’ models based on tints and shades.\n\nIn an attempt to accommodate more traditional and intuitive color mixing models, computer graphics pioneers at PARC and NYIT developed the HSV model in the mid-1970s, formally described by Alvy Ray Smith in the August 1978 issue of \"Computer Graphics\". In the same issue, Joblove and Greenberg described the HSL model—whose dimensions they labeled \"hue\", \"relative chroma\", and \"intensity\"—and compared it to HSV. Their model was based more upon how colors are organized and conceptualized in human vision in terms of other color-making attributes, such as hue, lightness, and chroma; as well as upon traditional color mixing methods—e.g., in painting—that involve mixing brightly colored pigments with black or white to achieve lighter, darker, or less colorful colors.\n\nThe following year, 1979, at SIGGRAPH, Tektronix introduced graphics terminals using HSL for color designation, and the Computer Graphics Standards Committee recommended it in their annual status report. These models were useful not only because they were more intuitive than raw RGB values, but also because the conversions to and from RGB were extremely fast to compute: they could run in real time on the hardware of the 1970s. Consequently, these models and similar ones have become ubiquitous throughout image editing and graphics software since then.\n\nAnother influential older cylindrical color model is the early-20th-century Munsell color system. Albert Munsell began with a spherical arrangement in his 1905 book \"A Color Notation\", but he wished to properly separate color-making attributes into separate dimensions, which he called \"hue\", \"value\", and \"chroma\", and after taking careful measurements of perceptual responses, he realized that no symmetrical shape would do, so he reorganized his system into a lumpy blob.\n\nMunsell’s system became extremely popular, the de facto reference for American color standards—used not only for specifying the color of paints and crayons, but also, e.g., electrical wire, beer, and soil color—because it was organized based on perceptual measurements, specified colors via an easily learned and systematic triple of numbers, because the color chips sold in the \"Munsell Book of Color\" covered a wide gamut and remained stable over time (rather than fading), and because it was effectively marketed by Munsell’s Company. In the 1940s, the Optical Society of America made extensive measurements, and adjusted the arrangement of Munsell colors, issuing a set of \"renotations\". The trouble with the Munsell system for computer graphics applications is that its colors are not specified via any set of simple equations, but only via its foundational measurements: effectively a lookup table. Converting from requires interpolating between that table’s entries, and is extremely computationally expensive in comparison with converting from or which only requires a few simple arithmetic operations.\n\nIn densitometry, a model quite similar to the hue defined above is used for describing colors of CMYK process inks. In 1953, Frank Preucil developed two geometric arrangements of hue, the \"Preucil hue circle\" and the \"Preucil hue hexagon\", analogous to our \"H\" and \"H\", respectively, but defined relative to idealized cyan, yellow, and magenta ink colors. The \"Preucil \"hue error\"\" of an ink indicates the difference in the \"hue circle\" between its color and the hue of the corresponding idealized ink color. The \"grayness\" of an ink is , where \"m\" and \"M\" are the minimum and maximum among the amounts of idealized cyan, magenta, and yellow in a density measurement.\n\nThe Swedish Natural Color System (NCS), widely used in Europe, takes a similar approach to the Ostwald bicone at right. Because it attempts to fit color into a familiarly shaped solid based on \"phenomenological\" instead of photometric or psychological characteristics, it suffers from some of the same disadvantages as HSL and HSV: in particular, its lightness dimension differs from perceived lightness, because it forces colorful yellow, red, green, and blue into a plane.\n\nThe International Commission on Illumination (CIE) developed the XYZ model for describing the colors of light spectra in 1931, but its goal was to match human visual metamerism, rather than to be perceptually uniform, geometrically. In the 1960s and 70s, attempts were made to transform XYZ colors into a more relevant geometry, influenced by the Munsell system. These efforts culminated in the 1976 CIELUV and CIELAB models. The dimensions of these models— and , respectively—are cartesian, based on the opponent process theory of color, but both are also often described using polar coordinates— and , respectively—where \"L\"* is lightness, \"C\"* is chroma, and \"h\"* is hue angle. Officially, both CIELAB and CIELUV were created for their color difference metrics ∆\"E\"* and ∆\"E\"*, particularly for use defining color tolerances, but both have become widely used as color order systems and color appearance models, including in computer graphics and computer vision. For example, gamut mapping in ICC color management is usually performed in CIELAB space, and Adobe Photoshop includes a CIELAB mode for editing images. CIELAB and CIELUV geometries are much more perceptually relevant than many others such as RGB, HSL, HSV, YUV/YIQ/YCbCr or XYZ, but are not perceptually perfect, and in particular have trouble adapting to unusual lighting conditions.\n\nThe HCL color space seems to be synonymous with CIELCH.\n\nThe CIE’s most recent model, CIECAM02 (CAM stands for \"color appearance model\"), is more theoretically sophisticated and computationally complex than earlier models. Its aims are to fix several of the problems with models such as CIELAB and CIELUV, and to explain not only responses in carefully controlled experimental environments, but also to model the color appearance of real-world scenes. Its dimensions \"J\" (lightness), \"C\" (chroma), and \"h\" (hue) define a polar-coordinate geometry.\n\nThere are various types of color systems that classify color and analyse their effects. The American Munsell color system devised by Albert H. Munsell is a famous classification that organises various colors into a color solid based on hue, saturation and value. Other important color systems include the Swedish Natural Color System (NCS), the Optical Society of America's Uniform Color Space (OSA-UCS), and the Hungarian Coloroid system developed by Antal Nemcsics from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Of those, the NCS is based on the opponent-process color model, while the Munsell, the OSA-UCS and the Coloroid attempt to model color uniformity. The American Pantone and the German RAL commercial color-matching systems differ from the previous ones in that their color spaces are not based on an underlying color model.\n\nWe also use \"color model\" to indicate a model or mechanism of color vision for explaining how color signals are processed from visual cones to ganglion cells. For simplicity, we call these models color mechanism models. The classical color mechanism models are Young–Helmholtz's trichromatic model and Hering's opponent-process model. Though these two theories were initially thought to be at odds, it later came to be understood that the mechanisms responsible for color opponency receive signals from the three types of cones and process them at a more complex level.\n\nVertebrate animals were primitively tetrachromatic. They possessed four types of cones—long, mid, short wavelength cones, and ultraviolet sensitive cones. Today, fish, amphibians, reptiles and birds are all tetrachromatic. Placental mammals lost both the mid and short wavelength cones. Thus, most mammals do not have complex color vision—they are dichromatic but they are sensitive to ultraviolet light, though they cannot see its colors. Human trichromatic color vision is a recent evolutionary novelty that first evolved in the common ancestor of the Old World Primates. Our trichromatic color vision evolved by duplication of the long wavelength sensitive opsin, found on the X chromosome. One of these copies evolved to be sensitive to green light and constitutes our mid wavelength opsin. At the same time, our short wavelength opsin evolved from the ultraviolet opsin of our vertebrate and mammalian ancestors.\n\nHuman red-green color blindness occurs because the two copies of the red and green opsin genes remain in close proximity on the X chromosome. Because of frequent recombination during meiosis, these gene pairs can get easily rearranged, creating versions of the genes that do not have distinct spectral sensitivities.\n\n\n\n"}

Aquinas wrote the treatise in 1263 while he was papal theologian and conventual lector in the Dominican \"studium\" at Orvieto after his first regency as professor of theology at the University of Paris which ended in 1259 and before he took up his duties in 1265 reforming the Dominican \"studium\" at Santa Sabina, the forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\", in Rome.\n\nThe title of the treatise was not given by Aquinas himself, and it contains nothing that is directed against the doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox Church, but only, in the view of theologian Yves Congar, a defence of Catholic doctrine against Eastern misunderstandings.\n\nThe 72 chapters of the work are each of the length of a paragraph in a modern book. In it Aquinas presents the teaching of the Greek Church Fathers as in harmony with that of the Latin Church. The book is arranged in two parts, the first of 32 chapters and the second of 40, each part preceded by a prologue, and the work as a whole concluded with an epilogue. All the first part and 31 of the 40 chapters of the second concern pneumatology (doctrine on the Holy Spirit). Of the final 9 chapters, 7 deal with the position of the Roman Pontiff, and the last two with the use of leavened bread in the Eucharist and with purgatory. In all of these Aquinas quoted expressions by Fathers of the Greek Church in support of the teaching propounded by the Latin Church.\n\nAquinas died on his way to participate in the 1274 Second Council of Lyons, to which he had been invited, but this treatise, which he had written eleven years before and not for the use of this Council, was influential at the Council.\n\nThe 1968 Leonine edition is available in Latin at the Corpus Thomisticum website.\n\nA complete English translation is given at the website of the Dominican Province of St Joseph.\n\nA different English translation, but only of the first ten chapters, is found at the website of Ecclesia Triumphans Catholic Apologetics.\n\nThe titles of the first ten chapters given in the latter translation indicate something of the contents of the short work:\n\nIn his treatise, Aquinas \"demonstrated that there was a theological harmony between the Greek Church Fathers and the Latin Church\". He pointed out that one source of misunderstandings between Greeks and Latins was the difficulty of finding appropriate words in each language` with which to translate technical theological terms used in the other:\n\nThe apologetic impact of the work is limited, due to the fact that Thomas uses a collection of texts compilled by Nicholas of Crotone which contains doubtful attributions and personal glosses of the compiller that bent the text in direction of the Latin theology. According to Jean-Pierre Torell, \"on four specific questions concerning the procession \"a filio\", the primacy of the pope, the Eucharistic celebration with unleavened bread, and purgatory, Thomas is clearly forced to rely more on the texts that are closer to Latin theology, when these are in fact glosses foreign to the Fathers.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "11159737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11159737", "title": "Dimidiation", "text": "Dimidiation\n\nIn heraldry, dimidiation is a method of marshalling (heraldically combining) two coats of arms.\n\nFor a time, dimidiation preceded the method known as impalement. Whereas impalement involves placing the whole of both coats of arms side by side in the same shield, dimidiation involves placing the dexter half of one coat of arms alongside the sinister half of the other. In the case of marriage, the dexter half of the husband's arms would be placed alongside the sinister half of the wife's arms.\n\nThe practice fell out of use because the result was not always aesthetically pleasing (sometimes creating strange hybrids, as seen in the examples at right), and also because in some cases, it would result in a shield that confusingly looked like one coat of arms rather than a combination of two. For instance, a bend combined with a bend sinister might result in a combination that simply looked like a chevron, thus hiding the fact that two coats of arms had been combined.\n\nIn order to avoid these drawbacks, it became customary to use more than half of each coat of arms when combining them through dimidiation. Once this practice had begun, the logical progression was to include the whole of both coats of arms in the new shield, so that in effect, impalement replaced dimidiation as a method of combining coats of arms.\n\nA general rule which carries over from dimidiation to impalement is that if a coat of arms with a bordure (or tressure, orle, etc.) is impaled, the bordure should not continue down the line of impalement.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21650967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21650967", "title": "Four harmonious animals", "text": "Four harmonious animals\n\nThe four harmonious animals, four harmonious friends or four harmonious brothers \n( or ) is a figure in Jātaka tales and other Buddhist mythology, and can often be found as subject in Bhutanese and Tibetan art. It is perhaps the most common theme in Bhutanese folk art, featuring on many temple murals, \"stupas\", and as a decorative pattern on many daily utensils. It is the best-known national folktale of Bhutan and is popular in Tibet and Mongolia: it is widely referred to in these cultures.\n\nA popular scene often found as wall paintings in Tibetan religious buildings represents an elephant standing under a fruit tree carrying a monkey, a hare and a bird (usually a partridge, but sometimes a grouse, and in Bhutan a hornbill) on top of each other. The scene refers to a legend which tells that four animals were trying to find out who was the oldest. The elephant said that the tree was already fully grown when he was young, the monkey that the tree was small when he was young, the hare that he saw the tree as a sapling when he was young and the bird claimed that he had excreted the seed from which the tree grew. So the bird was recognized by the other animals as the oldest, and the four animals lived together in co-dependence and cooperation, helping each other to enjoy the fruits of the tree. After the story is finished, it is revealed the partridge was the Buddha in a previous life. The story was meant as an illustration of cooperation and respect for seniority, and was told by the Buddha after some of his students had failed to pay due respect to the senior disciple Śāriputra. Sometimes the tale also describes the animals upholding the five precepts and teaching them to others. One of the oldest extant forms of the story is the Pali version, called the \"Tittira Jataka\".\n\nCommunal harmony and respect for seniority are the main moral of the story. Such respect stands in contrast with a pecking-order according to strength, size and power: it is which is most respected, not the elephant. Although the Buddha did sometimes downplay the value respecting older people merely for their age, in this story he illustrates that a senior person should nonetheless be respected for their experience, because, as Tachibana points out, \"the maturity of age is generally the sign of much experience\". However, the story led to the establishment of several rules of conduct with regard to respect for seniority in the context of the monastic life, in which the as a monk ('; ') is measured, rather than . Buddhist monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu explains the relation between respect for seniority and harmony, drawing from the story: \"A hierarchy based on seniority, however, is both objective and, in the long run, less oppressive: One's place in the hierarchy is not a measure of one's worth. Such a hierarchy also discourages the pride and competition that would come if bhikkhus could fight their way up the hierarchy by outdoing the measurable merit of others.\"\n\nThe four animals represent the different habitats of the animal world—the sky, the trees, the ground, and underground. The partridge assumes the role of the most senior animal: in pre-modern India, the partridge was highly regarded for its intelligence and understanding of language. The excreting of the seed of the tree is relevant, because some Indian trees are believed to only sprout when the seed is excreted by a bird, thus further amplifying the concept of cooperation and mutual dependence. The image of the animals standing on each other’s shoulders, on the back of a patient elephant, also portrays social and environmental harmony: the bird finds a seed and plants it, then the rabbit waters it, and the monkey fertilizes it. Once the seed sprouts and begins to grow, the elephant protects it. After some time, the small plant grows into a big, beautiful tree full of healthy fruit. By working together and using their individual talents, the four friends are able to reach and enjoy the fruit.\n\nThe primary source for the Buddhist legend of the four harmonious brothers is the \"Vinayavastu\" (), which forms the first section of the Kangyur, the canon of Tibetan Buddhism. In canons of other Buddhist traditions, such as in the Pali Canon of Theravāda Buddhism, and in the texts of the Mahāsāṃghika, Mūla-Sarvāstivāda and Sarvāstivāda orders, almost the same \"Jātaka\" tale is found in the \"Vinaya\" and \"Jātaka\" collections. The Dharmaguptaka and Mahīśāsaka orders did not consider the story part of the \"Jātaka\", however, and only included it in their \"Vinayas\". Bhikkhu Analayo believes that originally the story was not considered a previous life of the Buddha, but only a didactic parable taught by the Buddha.\n\nOld Irish scholar Eleanor Hull has pointed out that the story may reveal a custom of the ancient world to determine the date based on the life spans of different animals. Stories dealing with the question which animal lives the longest are found throughout the world. Asiatic versions of the story usually feature three animals, as indeed, the Pali and Chinese versions of the \"Jātaka\" do. As for the fourth animal not present in the Pali version, the hare—it was included in later versions.\n\nA similar story was made famous when the Brothers Grimm included it in their collection of folk tales, as the \"Town Musicians of Bremen\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2458694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2458694", "title": "Gongbi", "text": "Gongbi\n\nGongbi () is a careful realist technique in Chinese painting, the opposite of the interpretive and freely expressive \"xieyi\" (寫意 'sketching thoughts') style.\n\nThe name is from the Chinese \"gong jin\" meaning 'tidy' (meticulous brush craftsmanship). The \"gongbi\" technique uses highly detailed brushstrokes that delimits details very precisely and without independent or expressive variation. It is often highly colored and usually depicts figural or narrative subjects. One of the better known Gongbi works is the Song Dynasty Scroll, 17 feet long and includes intricate details that most don’t pick up. It is one of many popular tourist attractions in China today, as it is updated regularly to try and show what modern China looks like compared to when it was created during the Song Dynasty. \n\nThe term related to \"gongbi\", \"jiehua\" (or \"boundary painting\"), refers to the accurate depiction of architectural forms aided by the ruler.\n\nThe \"gongbi\" style had its beginnings approximately 2000 years ago during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) when Han's political stability and its prosperity favored the advancement of the arts. These paintings peaked out between the Tang and Song dynasties (7th to 13th centuries) when these refined paintings were endorsed and collected by the royal families of China. To perfect this style the \"gongbi\" artists must totally commit themselves to these techniques. Only the wealthy could afford such artists. This style of art was accomplished in secret in royal palaces and private homes. Gongbi is one of the oldest Chinese painting techniques that feature narratives or high authority figures in them.\n\nWhen using brushes to paint gongbi, there are specific types for contouring and colouring. There are four types of brushes for contouring; Hong Mao (red hairs), are used to draw thick strokes mainly for landscape and background visuals. Yi Wen is used for longer lines to paint clothing, for example. Ye Jing brushes are used to contour flowers and bedsheets. Xie Zhua is the finest contour brush used to paint strokes of dragonflies and specific detail in the painting. There are three sizes of brushes used to colour the surface of the painting: Da Bai Yun (large white cloud), Zhong Bai Yun (average white cloud) and Xiao Bai Yun (small white cloud). Rough drafts are usually drawn on rice paper. If there is only one draft, a special type of paper called Xuan paper is used. The soft paper is able to absorb water well, best used for Chinese painting and calligraphy. Silk can also be used, which is sized as well.\n\n\"Gongbi\" requires drawing with fine lines first to represent the exaggerated likenesses of the objects, and then adds washes of ink and color layer by layer, so as to approach the perfection of exquisiteness and fine art. The practice of Gongbi is specifically on rice paper when sketching out the design and layout of the drawing. Typically, pencil is used before beginning the second draft with the tipped brushes. The variation and detail in strokes are important especially when layering each wash of ink on top of each other. There are upward and downward strokes used that emphasize detailed pictures such as facial features and insects. After hundreds of years, a technique was developed for all gongbi artists as a system. Lines are used first to contour the figure and determine the fine outlines of the painting. Modest colors are added to the painting that add onto a sense of nature; flamboyant colors are used when the content of the painting has accentuated lines.\n\nListed chronologically:\n"}
{"id": "33646727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33646727", "title": "Hilya", "text": "Hilya\n\nThe term hilya (Arabic حلية (plural: \"ḥilan\", \"ḥulan\"), (plural: \"hilyeler\") denotes both a visual form in Ottoman art and a religious genre of Ottoman Turkish literature, each dealing with the physical description of Muhammad. Hilya literally means \"ornament\".\n\nThey originate with the discipline of \"shama'il\", the study of Muhammad's appearance and character, based on hadith accounts, most notably Tirmidhi's \"al-Shama'il al-Muhamadiyyah wa al-Khasa'il al-Mustafawiyyah\" (\"The Sublime Characteristics of Muhammad\").\n\nIn Ottoman-era folk Islam, there was a belief that reading and possessing Muhammad's description protects the person from trouble in this world and the next, it became customary to carry such descriptions, rendered in fine calligraphy and illuminated, as amulets. In 17th-century Ottoman Turkey, \"hilyes\" developed into an art form with a standard layout, often framed and used as a wall decoration.\nLater \"hilyes\" were also written for the first four Caliphs, the companions of Muhammad, Muhammad's grandchildren (Hasan and Hussein) and Islamic saints (walis).\n\n\"Hilye\", both as the literary genre and as the graphic art form, originates from \"shama'il\", the study of Muhammad's appearance and character. The best source on this subject is considered to be Imam Tirmidhi's \"al-Shama'il al-Muhamadiyyah wa al-Khasa'il al-Mustafawiyyah\" (\"The Sublime Characteristics of Muhammad\"). The acceptance and influence of this work has led to the use of the term \"shama'il\" (appearance) to mean Muhammad's fine morals and unique physical beauty. As they contained hadiths describing Muhammad's spirit and physique, \"shama-il\" have been the source of \"hilye\". The best known and accepted of these hadith are attributed to his son-in-law and cousin Ali. \nThe sources of \"hilye\" have been the six main hadith books along with other hadith sources, attributed to people such as Aisha, `Abd Allah ibn `Abbas, Abu Hurairah, Hasan ibn Ali. While \"shama'il\" lists the physical and spiritual characteristics of Muhammad in detail, in \"hilye\" these are written about in a literary style.\n\nAmong other descriptive \"Shama'il\" text are the \"Dala'il al-Nubuwwah\" of Al-Bayhaqi, \"Tarih-i Isfahan\" of Abu Naeem Isfahani, \"Al-Wafa bi Fadha'il al-Mustafa\" of Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi and \"Al-Shifa\" of Qadi Ayyad are the main shemaa-il and hilya books.\n\nAlthough many \"hilyes\" exist in Turkish literature, Persian literature does not have many examples of the \"shama'il\" and \"hilye\" genre. Abu Naeem Isfahani wrote a work titled \"Hilyetü'l-Evliya\", but it is not about Muhammad. For this reason, the \"hilye\" is considered one of Turkey's national literary genres. Turkish literature has also some early works that may have inspired the appearance of the \"hilye\" as a literary genre. The \"Vesiletü'n-necat\" of Süleyman Çelebi (1351-1422 ), and the \"Muhammeddiye\" of Yazıcıoğlu Mehmed, referred to Muhammad's characteristics.\n\nA 255-verse long \"Risale-i Resul\" about the attributes of Muhammad, written by a writer with the penname of Şerifi, was presented to Shahzade Bayezid, one of the sons of Suleiman the Magnificent, at an unknown date that was presumably before the Shahzade's death in 1562. This is believed to be the earliest \"hilye\" in verse form in Turkish literature. However, the \"Hilye-i Şerif\" by Mehmet Hakani (d. 1606–07) is considered the finest example of the genre (see section below). The first \"hilye\" written in prose form is \"Hilye-i Celile ve Şemail-i 'Aliye\" by Hoca Sadeddin Efendi.\n\nAlthough the \"hilye\" tradition started with descriptions of Muhammad, later \"hilyes\" were written about the first four Caliphs, the companions of Muhammad, Muhammad's grandchildren (Hasan and Hussein) and Islamic saints (walis) such as Mevlana. The second most important \"hilye\", after Hakani's, is considered to be Cevri İbrahim Çelebi's \"hilye\", \"Hilye-i Çihar-Yar-ı Güzin\" (1630), about the physical appearance of the first four caliphs. Another important \"hilye\" writer is Nesati Ahmed Dede (d. 1674), whose 184-verse long poem is about the physical characteristics of 14 prophets and Adam. Other notable \"hilyes\" are Dursunzâde Bakayi's \"Hilye'tûl-Enbiya ve Çeyar-ı Güzîn\" (hilye of the prophet and his four caliphs), Nahifi's (d. 1738) prose \"hilye\" \"Nüzhet-ûl-Ahyar fi Tercüment-iş-Şemîl-i\" and Arif Süleyman Bey's (1761) \"Nazire-î Hakânî\".\n\n\"Hilyes\" can be written as standalone prose or poems (often in the masnavi form). They can also be part of two other forms of Turkish Islamic literature, a Mevlid (account of Muhammad's life) or a \"Mir'aj-name\" (accounts of Muhammad's Night Journey).\n\nWhile writers developed \"hilye\" as a literary genre, calligraphers and illuminators developed it into a decorative art form. Because of their supposed protective effect, a practice developed in Ottoman Turkey of the 17th century of carrying Muhammad's description on one's person. Similarly, because of the belief that a house with a \"hilye\" will not see poverty, trouble, fear or the devil, such texts came to be displayed prominently in a house. The term of hilye was used for the art form for presenting these texts. Thus, the \"hilye\", as a vehicle for Muhammad's presence after his death, was believed to have a talismanic effect, capable of protecting a house, a child, a traveller, or a person in difficulty. In addition, the purpose of the \"hilye\" is to help visualize Muhammad as a mediator between the sacred and human worlds, to connect with him by using the viewing of the \"hilye\" as an opportunity to send a traditional blessing upon him, and to establish an intimacy with him.\n\nThe pocket \"hilyes\" were written on a piece of paper, small enough to fit in a breast pocket after being folded in three. The folding lines were reinforced with cloth or leather. Other pocket \"hilyes\" were made of wood. \"Hilyes\" to be displayed on a wall were prepared on paper mounted on wooden panels, although in the 19th century, thick paper sheets became another medium. The top part of \"hilyes\" that were laid on wooded panels were carved and cut out in the form of a crown. The crown part would be richly illuminated and miniatures of Medina, the tomb of Muhammad or the Kabaa would be placed there, together or separately.\n\nOttoman Turks have commissioned scribes to write \"hilyes\" in fine calligraphy and had them decorated with illuminators. Serving as a textual portraits of the prophets, \"hilye\" panels have decorated homes for centuries. These calligraphic panels were often framed and came to be used as wall decorations in houses, mosques and shrines, fulfilling an equivalent role to that played by images of Jesus in the Christian tradition. As symbolic art, they provided an aesthetically pleasing reminder of Muhammad's presence without involving the type of \"graven image\" unacceptable to most Muslims' sensitivities. Although not common, some \"hilyes\" show the influence of Orthodox Christian icon-making because they are made like triptychs with foldable side panels.\n\nThe first recorded instance of Hilye-i Sherif panels is generally believed to have been prepared by the notable scribe Hâfiz Osman (1642–1698). He was one of earliest scribes known to make such works, although it has been suggested that another famous scribe, Ahmed Karahisarî (1468–1556), may have created one \"hilye\" panel about a century before. Hafız Osman was known to have experimented with pocket \"hilyes\" in his youth, one of these dates from 1668. Its text was written in very small \"naskh\" script and has dimensions of 22x14 cm. It consisted of a description of Mohammad in Arabic, and below that its Turkish translation, written in diagonal, to create a triangular block of text.\n\nA characteristic feature of the texts shown at the centre of \"hilyes\" is their praise for the beauty of Muhammad's physical appearance and character. While containing a verbal description of what Muhammad looked like, a \"hilye\" leaves picturing Muhammad's appearance to the reader's imagination, in line with the mainly aniconic nature of Islamic art.\n\nThe standard layout for the Ottoman \"hilye\" panel is generally attributed to Hâfiz Osman. This layout is generally considered to be the best and has come to be the classical form. It contains the following elements:\n\n\nThe remainder of the space is taken up with decorative Ottoman illumination, of the type usual for the period, often with a border framing the whole in a contrasting design to the main central field that is the background of the text sections. The \"verse\" and \"corners\" normally use a larger \"thuluth\" script, while the \"head\" section with the \"bismallah\" is written in \"muhaqqaq\". Unlike the literary genre of \"hilye\", the text on calligraphic \"hilyes\" is generally in prose form.\n\nThe names in Turkish of the central structural elements of the \"hilye\" are, from top to bottom, \"başmakam\" (head station), \"göbek\" (belly), \"kuşak\" (belt) and \"etek\" (skirt). This anthropomorphic naming makes it clear that the \"hilye\" represents a human body, whose purpose is \"to recall semantically the Prophet's presence via a graphic construct\". It has been suggested that Hafiz Osman's \"hilye\" design might have been inspired by the celebrated Hilye-i Şerif, which in turn was based on the possibly spurious hadith according to which Muhammad has said \"... Whoever sees my hilye after me is as though he has seen me... \". If so, a \"hilye\" might have been meant to be \"not read\" but seen and contemplated, because it is really an image made of plain text.\n\nThe standard Hilye-i Şerif composition has been followed by calligraphers since its creation in the late 17th century. Some examples from the 19th century and two made by Hafiz Osman can be seen below.\n\nHowever, deviations from the standard model do occur and many innovative designs have been produced as well.\n\nThere are several reasons given for the popularity of graphic \"hilyes\". Islam prohibits the depiction of graphic representations of people that may lead to idols. For this reason, Islamic art developed in the forms of calligraphy, miniatures and other non-figurative arts. In miniatures, Muhammad's face was either veiled or blanked. Because of the prohibition on drawing the face of Muhammad, the need to represent Muhammad was satisfied by writing his name and characteristics.\n\nMany authors have commented that another reason is the affection that Muslims feel for Muhammad, which leads them to read about his physical and moral beauty. The (apocryphal) hadith that those who memorize his \"hilye\" and keep it close to their heart will see Muhammad in their dreams would have been another reason. Muslim people's love for Muhammad is considered to be one of the reasons for the display of \"hilye\" panels at a prominent place in their homes (see Graphic art form section below).\n\nHakani has said in his poem that a house with a \"hilye\" will be protected from trouble. Another motivation would have been the hadith given by Hakani in the Hilye-i Şerif, which states that those who read and memorize Muhammad's \"hilye\" will attain great rewards in this and the other world, will see Muhammad in their dreams, will be protected from many disasters, and will receive Muhammad's esteem.\n\nIn the \"sebeb-i te'lîf\" ve \"hâtime\" section of the \"hilye\", the writer gives the reasons to write the \"hilye\". Hakani wrote that his reason was to be worthy of Muhammad's holy intercession (\"shefaat\") on doomsday and to receive a prayer from willing readers. Other \"hilye\" writers express, usually at the end of the \"hilye\", their desire to be commended to the esteem of Muhammad, the other prophets, or the four caliphs. One \"hilye\" writer, Hakim, wrote that he wishes that people will remember Muhammad as they look at his \"hilye\".\n\nHakani's Hilye-i Şerif has been an object of affection to many Turkish people. His poem has been copied on paper as well as on wooden panels by many calligraphers and has been read with the accompaniment of music in Mawlid ceremonies.\n\nAs an art form, \"hilye\" has mostly been restricted to Ottoman lands. A small number of instances of \"hilye\" panels were made in Iran, and they reflect a Shiite adaptation of the form: there is a Persian translation below the Arabic text and the names of the Twelve Imams are listed. In the 19th century, some Iranian \"hilyes\" combined the traditional \"hilye\" format with the Iranian tradition of pictorial representation of Muhammad and Ali.\n\nThere are contemporary exponents of the art outside this region, such as the Pakistani calligrapher Rasheed Butt and the American calligrapher Mohamed Zakariya.\n\nIn Turkey, giving a \"hilye\" panel as a marriage gift for the happiness of the union and safety of the home has been a tradition that is disappearing. Covering such panels with sheer curtains was part of the religious folklore in Istanbul households.\n\nSince Osman's time, every Turkish calligrapher has been expected to produce at least one \"hilye\", using the three \"muhaqqaq\", \"thuluth\" and \"naskh\" scripts. It is a common tradition for masters of calligraphy to obtain their diploma of competency (\"icazetname\") after completing a \"hilye\" panel as their final assignment.\n\nThe art of \"hilye\" flourishes in Turkey. Contemporary artists continue to create \"hilyes\" in the classical form as well as to innovate. Modern \"hilyes\" maintain the essence of a \"hilye\", even while the appearance of the elements of the \"hilye\" is customized or calligraphy is used to create abstract or figurative works. Contemporary \"hilyes\" are exhibited in major exhibitions in Turkey as well as outside the country.\n\nAccording to the Süleymaniye Vakfı, a Salafi influenced religious foundation in Turkey that publishes religious opinions (fatwa), \"hilye\" panels are works of art, but hanging them in the home has no religious value. That is, they provide no merit to those who hang them or carry them on their persons, and those who do not possess them have no deficit.\n\n\"Hilye-i Şerif\" (\"The Noble Description\", 1598–1599) by Mehmet Hakani, consisting of 712 verses, lists Muhammad's features as reported by Ali (see quotation in the Origins section above), then comments on each of them in 12-20 verses. Although some have found it to be of not great poetic merit, it was popular due to its subject matter. The poem is significant for having established the genre of \"hilye\". Later \"hilye\" writers such as Cevri, Nesati and Nafihi have praised Hakani and stated that they were following in his footsteps. The poem contains several themes detailed below that underscore the importance of reading and writing about the attributes of Muhammad.\n\nIn his \"hilye\", Hakani mentions the following hadith, which he attributes to Ali: A short time before Muhammad's death, when his crying daughter Fatima said to him: \"Ya Rasul-Allah, I will not be able to see your face any more!\" Muhammad commanded, \"Ya Ali, write down my appearance, for seeing my qualities is like seeing myself.\" The origin of this hadith is not known. Although probably apocryphal, it has had a fundamental effect on the development of the \"hilye\" genre. This hadith has been repeated by most other \"hilye\" writers.\n\nHakani states another hadith, also attributed to Ali. This hadith of unknown origin is said to have been in circulation since the 9th century but is not found in the reliable hadith collections. Repeated in other \"hilyes\" after Hakani's, this hadith has been influential in the establishment of the genre.:\n\nHakani's \"hilye\" includes a story about a poor man coming to the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid and presenting him a piece of paper on which Muhammad's \"hilye\" is written. Al-Rashid is so delighted to see this that he regales the dervish and rewards him with sacs of jewelry. At night, he sees Muhammad in his dream. Muhammad says to him \"you received and honored this poor man, so I will make you happy. God gave me the good news that whoever looks at my \"hilye\" and gets delight from it, presses it to his chest and protects it like his life, will be protected from hellfires on Doomsday; he will not suffer in this world nor in the other. You will be worthy of the sight of my face, and even more, of my holy lights.\"\n\nIt has become customary for other \"hilye\" authors that followed Hakani to mention in the introduction of their \"hilye\" (called \"havas-i hilye\") the hadith that seeing Muhammad in one's dream is the same as seeing him. The Harun Al-Rashid story has also been mentioned frequently by other authors as well. These elements from Hakani's \"hilye\" have established the belief that reading and writing \"hilyes\" protects the person from all trouble, in this world as well as the next.\n\nBehiery, Valerie, \"Hilya\", in Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture: An Encyclopedia of the Prophet of God (2 vols.), Edited by C.

She is best known as the writer and director of the 2013 Disney animated feature \"Frozen\", for which she earned an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Lee is the first female director of a Walt Disney Animation Studios feature film and the first female director of a feature film that earned more than $1 billion in gross box office revenue.\n\nLee was born in October 22, 1971 to Linda Lee and Saverio Rebecchi, who were living in Barrington at the time; after their divorce, Lee and her older sister, Amy, lived with their mother in East Providence, Rhode Island. Both Lee and her older sister graduated from East Providence High School and the University of New Hampshire. Lee earned a bachelor's degree in English in 1992 and went to New York City, where she worked as a graphic artist in publishing; she designed audiobooks for Random House. As an adult, she began using her mother's maiden name, Lee, in a professional capacity and in January 1995, legally changed her last name from Rebecchi to Lee.\n\nAfter the loss of her boyfriend at age 20, Lee became closer to her sister Amy. At around 30 years old, she entered Columbia University School of the Arts and earned a Master of Fine Arts in film. There she met Phil Johnston, her future writing partner on \"Wreck-It Ralph\". Lee graduated from Columbia in 2005 and stayed in New York City, where she developed a background in live-action film, working as assistant director on and producer of the short film in 2004, \"A Thousand Words\".\n\nIn March 2011, Johnston called Lee to ask her to join him at Disney Animation in Burbank to help him write \"Wreck-It Ralph\". What was supposed to be a temporary eight-week writing gig eventually turned into a much longer commitment. First, she was asked to stay on until \"Ralph\" was finished. She then became involved with \"Frozen\", initially as screenwriter and later as co-director with Chris Buck. When Lee was brought on board, she helped transition the film from an action-adventure to \"more musical, with more comedy.\" She worked closely with the songwriters (Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez) in the writing of the script. \"Frozen\" gave her the opportunity to celebrate \"wild and wonderful\" girls like her childhood self, and her daughter, Agatha. It was also the highest-earning film with a female director in terms of domestic earnings, until surpassed by Warner Bros.' \"Wonder Woman\".\n\nOn May 17, 2014, Lee delivered the commencement address to the class of 2014 at her alma mater, the University of New Hampshire. She revealed that she had struggled with self-doubt while growing up, and then in April of her junior year of college, her boyfriend was killed in a boating accident, after which she felt \"no doubt, only grief ... and for a brief moment ... [knew] better than to waste a second doubting.\" Years later, that memory would help her overcome her initial doubt over whether she was good enough to apply to Columbia. At Columbia, Johnston recognized she was talented but insecure, and one day asked her to \"promise ... that you'll leave it out of your work, just know that you're good enough and move on.\" She concluded: \"If I learned one thing it is that self-doubt is one of the most destructive forces. It makes you defensive instead of open, reactive instead of active. Self-doubt is consuming and cruel and my hope today is that we can all collectively agree to ban it ... Please know, from here on out, you are enough and dare I say, more than enough.\" UNH then awarded her the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.\n\nIn September 2014, it was announced that Lee and Buck would co-direct a short film featuring the \"Frozen\" characters called \"Frozen Fever\". It was released in March 2015. Lee was one of several Disney writers and directors who received credit for \"Creative Leadership\" on the 2014 film \"Big Hero 6\" and the 2016 film \"Moana\", and received screen credit as one of the writers who developed the story for the 2016 film \"Zootopia\".\n\nIn August 2014, \"Variety\" reported that Lee's next project after \"Frozen\" would be an adaptation of Madeleine L'Engle's 1962 novel \"A Wrinkle in Time\". After the news broke, Lee tweeted: \"Been in love with the book for over 30 years. Writing this script means the world to me.\" Catherine Hand, the executive producer of the 2003 television film version, and Jim Whitaker produced for Disney, and Ava DuVernay directed the film, based on Lee's script. \"A Wrinkle in Time\" was released in March 2018, but Lee's removal of all Christian references from the story caused a backlash and boycott from several Christian groups, including the online film reviewing site MovieGuide. The film received mixed reviews from the critics, and despite grossing $100 million domestically, ended its run as a box-office bomb.\n\nOn March 12, 2015, Disney announced that Lee and Buck would co-direct a full length sequel to \"Frozen\".\n\nLee married Robert Joseph Monn on May 30, 1999, at the Rhode Island Country Club (they later divorced). They have a daughter Agatha Lee Monn (born in 2003), who sings the middle verse of the song \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\" in \"Frozen\".

A spin-off sequel, \"This Is 40\", was released in 2012.\n\nAlison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is a career-minded woman who has just been given an on-air role with E! and is living in the pool house with her sister Debbie's (Leslie Mann) family. Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is laid-back and sardonic. He lives off funds received in compensation for an injury and sporadically works on a celebrity porn website with his roommates (Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel and Martin Starr), in between smoking marijuana or going off with them at theme parks such as Knott's Berry Farm. While celebrating her promotion, Alison meets Ben at a local nightclub. After a night of drinking, they end up having sex. Due to a misunderstanding, they don't use protection: Alison uses the phrase \"Just do it already\" to encourage Ben to put the condom on, but he misinterprets this to mean to dispense with using one. The following morning, they quickly learn over breakfast that they have little in common and go their separate ways, which leaves Ben visibly upset.\n\nEight weeks later, Alison experiences morning sickness during an interview with James Franco and realizes she could be pregnant. She contacts Ben for the first time since their one-night stand to tell him. Although insensitive at first, Ben says he will be there to support Alison. While he is still unsure about being a parent, his father (Harold Ramis) is excited. Alison's mother (Joanna Kerns) tries to persuade her daughter to have an abortion, but Alison decides to keep the child. Later, Alison and Ben decide to give a relationship a chance. The couple's efforts include Ben making an awkward marriage proposal with an empty ring box, promising to get her one someday. Alison thinks it's too early to think about marriage, because she is more concerned with hiding the pregnancy from her bosses, believing that they will fire her if they ever found out. After a somewhat promising beginning, tensions surface in the relationship.\n\nAlison is increasingly worried about Ben's lack of responsibility and commitment, and has doubts about the longevity of their relationship. These thoughts are due to her sister's unhappy marriage. Debbie's husband, Pete (Paul Rudd), works as a talent scout for rock bands, but he leaves at odd hours in the night, which makes her suspect he is having an affair. Upon investigating, she learns that he is actually part of a fantasy baseball draft, and that he has been doing other activities such as going to the movies on his own, which he explains he participates in to be free from Debbie's controlling manner. This results in their separation, and when Ben expresses amusement at Pete's deception, it leads to a heated argument with Alison as they drive to her doctor. Angered, she ejects him from her car and abandons him in the middle of a busy street. He tracks her down to her appointment and they both start another argument, leading to their own breakup. Ben and Pete decide to go on a road trip to Las Vegas.\n\nUnder the heavy influence of psychedelic mushrooms, they realize their loss and decide to take responsibility for their relationships. Simultaneously, Debbie drags a timid Alison out partying with her, but they are refused admission to a nightclub by its apologetic bouncer (Craig Robinson) on account of Debbie's age and Alison's pregnancy, leading to Debbie's tearful laments about her life and her desire to have Pete back. They reconcile at their daughter's birthday party, but when Ben tries to work things out with Alison, she doesn't want to get back together. Alison's boss finds out about her pregnancy, and sees an opportunity to boost ratings with female viewers by having Alison interview pregnant celebrities. After a talk with his father, Ben decides to take responsibility and goes to great effort to change his ways, including moving out of his friends' house, getting an office job as a web designer, and creating a baby's room in his new apartment.\n\nHe also starts reading the pregnancy books that he had purchased early on. When Alison goes into labor and is unable to contact her doctor, she calls Ben, as Debbie and Pete are at Legoland. Ben discovers that the gynecologist they had been seeing (Loudon Wainwright) is out of town, at \na Bar Mitzvah, despite having assured them that he never took vacations. Ben calls him and leaves a furious voicemail, threatening murder. During labor, Alison apologizes for doubting Ben's commitment and admits that she never thought the man who got her pregnant would be the right one for her. When Debbie and Pete arrive at the hospital, Ben adamantly refuses to allow her to be at Alison's side, insisting that it's his place. Debbie is both furious and impressed that Ben took charge of the situation and begins to change her formerly negative opinion about him. The couple welcomes a baby girl (a boy in the alternate ending) and settle down happily together in a new apartment in Los Angeles.\n\nSeveral of the major cast members return from previous Judd Apatow projects: Seth Rogen, Martin Starr, Jason Segel, and James Franco all starred in the short-lived, cult television series \"Freaks and Geeks\" which Apatow produced. From the Apatow-created \"Undeclared\" (which also featured Rogen, Segel and Starr) there are Jay Baruchel and Loudon Wainwright III. Paul Feig, who co-created \"Freaks and Geeks\", starred in the Apatow-written movie \"Heavyweights\" and directed the Apatow-produced \"Bridesmaids\" also makes a brief cameo as the Fantasy Baseball Guy. Steve Carell, who makes a cameo appearance as himself, played the main role in Apatow's \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" which also starred Rogen and Rudd, as well as appearing in the Apatow-produced \"Anchorman\". Finally, Leslie Mann, who also appeared in \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\", is married to Apatow and their two daughters play her children in the movie.\n\nAnne Hathaway was originally cast in the role of Alison in the film, but dropped out due to creative reasons that Apatow attributed to Hathaway's disagreement with plans to use real footage of a woman giving birth. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Kate Bosworth auditioned for the part after Hathaway dropped out, but ended up losing out to Katherine Heigl.\n\nThe closing credits roll over cast members' baby photos. The image of Joanna Kerns as a young mother was previously famous from its use in opening credits of \"Growing Pains\"’ first few seasons.\n\nBennett Miller, the director of \"Capote\", appears in a mockumentary DVD feature called \"Directing the Director\", in which he is allegedly hired by the studio to supervise Apatow's work, but only interferes with it, eventually leading the two into a fist fight.\n\nThe film opened at #2 at the U.S. box office, grossing $30,690,990 in its opening weekend, behind \"\"s second weekend. The film grossed $148,768,917 domestically and $70,307,601 in foreign territories, totalling $219,076,518. The film also spent eight weeks in the box office top ten, the longest streak amongst May–June openers in 2007. A company that specializes in tracking responses to advertising spanning multiple types of media attributed the film's unexpected financial success to the use of radio and television ads in combination.\n\n\"Knocked Up\" received critical acclaim upon its release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 90%, based on 247 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Knocked Up\" is a hilarious, poignant and refreshing look at the rigors of courtship and child-rearing, with a sometimes raunchy, yet savvy script that is ably acted and directed.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 85 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" praised the film's humor despite its plot inconsistencies, noting that, \"probably because the central story doesn't quite gel, it's the loony, incidental throwaway moments that really make an impression.\" Chris Kaltenbach of \"The Baltimore Sun\" acknowledged the comic value of the film in spite of its shortcomings, saying, \"Yes, the story line meanders and too many scenes drone on; \"Knocked Up\" is in serious need of a good editor. But the laughs are plentiful, and it's the rare movie these days where one doesn't feel guilty about finding the whole thing funny.\"\n\nIn another such review, \"Variety\" magazine, while calling the film predictable, said that \"Knocked Up\" was \"explosively funny.\" On the television show \"Ebert & Roeper\", Richard Roeper and guest critic David Edelstein gave \"Knocked Up\" a \"two big thumbs up\" rating, with Roeper calling it \"likeable and real,\" noting that although \"at times things drag a little bit... still \"Knocked Up\" earns its sentimental moments.\"\n\nA more critical review in \"Time\" magazine noted that, although a typical Hollywood-style comedic farce, the unexpected short-term success of the film may be more attributable to a sociological phenomenon rather than the quality or uniqueness of the film \"per se\", positing that the movie's shock value, sexual humor and historically taboo themes may have created a brief nationwide discussion in which movie-goers would see the film \"so they can join the debate, if only to say it wasn't that good.\"\n\nCanadian author Rebecca Eckler wrote in \"Maclean's\" magazine about the similarities between the movie and her book, \"Knocked Up: Confessions of a Hip Mother-to-Be\", which was released in the U.S. in March 2005. She pursued legal action against Apatow and Universal Pictures on the basis of copyright infringement. In a public statement, Apatow said, \"Anyone who reads the book and sees the movie will instantly know that they are two very different stories about a common experience.\"\n\nAnother Canadian author, Patricia Pearson, also publicly claimed similarities between the film and her novel, \"Playing House\". She declined to sue and declared Eckler's lawsuit to be frivolous.\n\nMike White (longtime associate of Judd Apatow and screenwriter for \"School of Rock\", \"Freaks and Geeks\", \"Orange County\", and \"Nacho Libre\") is said to have been \"disenchanted\" by Apatow's later films, \"objecting to the treatment of women and gay men in Apatow's recent movies\", saying of \"Knocked Up\", \"At some point it starts feeling like comedy of the bullies, rather than the bullied.\"\n\nIn early reviews, both \"Slate\" Dana Stevens and the \"Los Angeles Times\" Carina Chocano wrote articles claiming the film propagated sexist attitudes, a topic which was the primary focus of a \"Slate\" magazine podcast in which \"New York\" editor Emily Nussbaum said: \"Alison [Heigl's character] made basically zero sense. She was just a completely inconsistent character... she was this pleasant, blandly hot, peculiarly tolerant, yet oddly \"blank\" nice girl. She seemed to have no actual needs or desires of her own...\" A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" explicitly compared \"Knocked Up\" to \"Juno\", calling the latter a \"feminist, girl-powered rejoinder and complement to \"Knocked Up.\"\"\n\nIn a later \"Vanity Fair\" interview, lead actress Katherine Heigl admitted that though she enjoyed working with Apatow and Rogen, she had a hard time enjoying the film itself, calling it \"a little sexist\" and claiming that the film \"paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys.\"\n\nIn response, Apatow did not deny the validity of her accusations, saying, \"I'm just shocked she [Heigl] used the word \"shrew\". I mean, what is this, the 1600s?\" Apatow has also claimed that the movie is supposed to be about how males are typically insensitive with females.\n\nHeigl's comments spurred widespread reaction in the media, including a \"The Huffington Post\" article in which she was labeled \"an assertive, impatient go-getter who quickly tired of waiting for her boyfriend to propose\". Heigl clarified her initial comments to \"People\" magazine, stating that, \"My motive was to encourage other women like myself to not take that element of the movie too seriously and to remember that it's a broad comedy,\" adding that, \"Although I stand behind my opinion, I'm disheartened that it has become the focus of my experience with the movie.\"\n\nMeghan O'Rourke of \"Slate\" called Heigl's comments unsurprising, noting \"\"Knocked Up\" was, as David Denby put it in \"The New Yorker\", the culminating artifact in what had become 'the dominant romantic-comedy trend of the past several years—the slovenly hipster and the female straight arrow. \"The Guardian\" noted that Heigl's comments \"provoked quite a backlash, and Heigl was described as ungrateful and a traitor\". In the wake of mounting accusations of sexism, director Judd Apatow discussed ways he might develop more authentic female characters.\n\nIn July 2009, while promoting their film \"Funny People\" Apatow and Rogen appeared on \"The Howard Stern Show\" and defended the work in \"Knocked Up\", disagreeing with the position Heigl had stated. Rogen pointed to Heigl's work in the film \"The Ugly Truth\" to illustrate his point. Rogen said: \"I hear there's a scene where she's wearing underwear with a vibrator in it, so I'd have to see if that is uplifting for women.\" Apatow remarked on Heigl's criticisms, stating that he had expected an apology from Heigl. \"You would think at some point I'd get a call saying she was sorry, that she was tired, and then the call never comes.\"\n\nIn August 2016, Rogen again spoke to Howard Stern about how he had felt hurt and somewhat betrayed back then by Heigl's comments. He went on to talk about what a great rapport they'd had on set while working together, and that at the time he had even envisioned making many more movies with her. Though Rogen wishes she would have apologized to him personally as opposed to publicly, he affirmed that he still really liked her, and that he never would have wanted the incident to hurt her career.\n\nHeigl responded by saying that Rogen had \"handled that so beautifully,\" and that she felt nothing but \"love and respect\" for him. \"It was so long ago at this point, I just wish him so much goodness, and I felt that from him, too,\" she said.\n\nThe film made the top-ten list of the jury for the 2007 AFI Awards as well as the top-ten lists of several well-known critics, with the AFI jury calling it the \"funniest, freshest comedy of this generation\" and a film that \"stretches the boundaries of romantic comedies.\" John Newman, respected film critic for the Boston Bubble, called the film \"a better, raunchy, modern version of \"Some Like it Hot\".\"\n\nEarly on the film was deemed the best reviewed wide release of 2007 by the Rotten Tomatoes' website.\n\nThe film appeared on many critics' top-ten lists of the best films of 2007.\n\nOn December 16, 2007, the film was chosen by the American Film Institute as one of the ten best movies of the year. It was one of the two pregnancy comedies on the list (\"Juno\" being the other). \"E! News\" praised the film's success, saying that, \"The unplanned pregnancy comedy, shut out of the Golden Globes and passed over by the L.A. and New York critics, was one of 10 films selected Sunday for the American Film Institute's year-end honors.\"\n\nAwards:\n\n\"Strange Weirdos: Music From and Inspired by the Film Knocked Up\", an original soundtrack album, was composed for the film by folk singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III and Joe Henry. However, the movie's lead song \"Daughter\" was written by Peter Blegvad.\n\nIn addition to Wainwright's tracks, there were approximately 40 songs featured in the motion picture that were not included on the official soundtrack on Concord Records.\n\nSome of the songs featured in \"Knocked Up\" are:\n\nSeveral separate Region 1 DVD versions were released on September 25, 2007. The theatrical R-rated version (128 minutes), an \"Unrated and Unprotected\" version (133 minutes) (separate fullscreen and widescreen editions available), a two-disc \"Extended and Unrated\" collector's edition, and an HD DVD \"Unrated and Unprotected\" version. On November 7, 2008, \"Knocked Up\" was released on Blu-ray following the discontinuation of HD DVD, along with other Apatow comedies \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" and \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\".\n\n\"Variety\" reported in January 2011 that Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann would reprise their \"Knocked Up\" roles for a new film written and directed by Apatow, titled \"This Is 40\". Apatow had stated that it would not be not a sequel or prequel to \"Knocked Up\", but a spin-off, focusing on Pete and Debbie, the couple played by Rudd and Mann. The film was shot in the summer of 2011, and was released on December 21, 2012.\n\n"}

{"id": "92016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92016", "title": "Persepolis", "text": "Persepolis\n\nPersepolis (, ) was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire (). It is situated northeast of the city of Shiraz in Fars Province, Iran. The earliest remains of Persepolis date back to 515 BCE. It exemplifies the Achaemenid style of architecture. UNESCO declared the ruins of Persepolis a World Heritage Site in 1979.\n\nThe English word \"\" is derived from Greek \"Persépolis\" (), a compound of \"Pérsēs\" () and \"pólis\" (), meaning \"the Persian city\" or \"the city of the Persians\". To the ancient Persians, the city was known as \"Pārsa\" (), which is also the word for the region of Persia.\n\nAn inscription left by Sasanian prince Shapur Sakanshah, the son of Hormizd II, refers to the site as , meaning \"Hundred Pillars\". Because medieval Persians attributed the site to Jamshid, an Iranian mythological king, it has been referred to as \"Takht-e-Jamshid\" (, ; ), literally meaning \"Throne of Jamshid\". Another name given to the site in the medieval period was , literally meaning \"Forty Minarets\".\n\nPersepolis is near the small river Pulvar, which flows into the Kur River.\n\nThe site includes a 125,000 square meter terrace, partly artificially constructed and partly cut out of a mountain, with its east side leaning on Rahmat Mountain. The other three sides are formed by retaining walls, which vary in height with the slope of the ground. Rising from on the west side was a double stair. From there, it gently slopes to the top. To create the level terrace, depressions were filled with soil and heavy rocks, which were joined together with metal clips.\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that the earliest remains of Persepolis date back to 515 BC. André Godard, the French archaeologist who excavated Persepolis in the early 1930s, believed that it was Cyrus the Great who chose the site of Persepolis, but that it was Darius I who built the terrace and the palaces. Inscriptions on these buildings support the belief that they were constructed by Darius. \n\nWith Darius I, the scepter passed to a new branch of the royal house. Persepolis probably became the capital of Persia proper during his reign. However, the city's location in a remote and mountainous region made it an inconvenient residence for the rulers of the empire. The country's true capitals were Susa, Babylon and Ecbatana. This may be why the Greeks were not acquainted with the city until Alexander the Great took and plundered it.\n\nDarius I's construction of Persepolis were carried out parallel to those of the Palace of Susa. According to Gene R. Garthwaite, the Susa Palace served as Darius' model for Persepolis. Darius I ordered the construction of the Apadana and the Council Hall (\"Tripylon\" or the \"Triple Gate\"), as well as the main imperial Treasury and its surroundings. These were completed during the reign of his son, Xerxes I. Further construction of the buildings on the terrace continued until the downfall of the Achaemenid Empire. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the Greek historian Ctesias mentioned that Darius I's grave was in a cliff face that could be reached with an apparatus of ropes.\n\nAround 519 BC, construction of a broad stairway was begun. The stairway was initially planned to be the main entrance to the terrace above the ground. The dual stairway, known as the Persepolitan Stairway, was built symmetrically on the western side of the Great Wall. The 111 steps measured wide, with treads of and rises of . Originally, the steps were believed to have been constructed to allow for nobles and royalty to ascend by horseback. New theories, however, suggest that the shallow risers allowed visiting dignitaries to maintain a regal appearance while ascending. The top of the stairways led to a small yard in the north-eastern side of the terrace, opposite the Gate of All Nations.\n\nGrey limestone was the main building material used at Persepolis. After natural rock had been leveled and the depressions filled in, the terrace was prepared. Major tunnels for sewage were dug underground through the rock. A large elevated water storage tank was carved at the eastern foot of the mountain. Professor Olmstead suggested the cistern was constructed at the same time that construction of the towers began.\n\nThe uneven plan of the terrace, including the foundation, acted like a castle, whose angled walls enabled its defenders to target any section of the external front. Diodorus Siculus writes that Persepolis had three walls with ramparts, which all had towers to provide a protected space for the defense personnel. The first wall was tall, the second, and the third wall, which covered all four sides, was in height, though no presence of the wall exists in modern times.\n\nThe function of Persepolis remains rather unclear. It was not one of the largest cities in Persia, let alone the rest of the empire, but appears to have been a grand ceremonial complex, that was only occupied seasonally; it is still not entirely clear where the king's private quarters actually were. Until recent challenges, most archaeologists held that it was especially used for celebrating Nowruz, the Persian New Year, held at the spring equinox, and still an important annual festivity in modern Iran. The Iranian nobility and the tributary parts of the empire came to present gifts to the king, as represented in the stairway reliefs.\n\nAfter invading Achaemenid Persia in 330 BC, Alexander the Great sent the main force of his army to Persepolis by the Royal Road. He stormed the \"Persian Gates\", a pass through modern-day Zagros Mountains. There Ariobarzanes of Persis successfully ambushed Alexander the Great's army, inflicting heavy casualties. After being held off for 30 days, Alexander the Great outflanked and destroyed the defenders. Ariobarzanes himself was killed either during the battle or during the retreat to Persepolis. Some sources indicate that the Persians were betrayed by a captured tribal chief who showed the Macedonians an alternate path that allowed them to outflank Ariobarzanes in a reversal of Thermopylae. After several months, Alexander allowed his troops to loot Persepolis.\nAround that time, a fire burned \"the palaces\" or \"the palace\". Scholars agree that this event, described in historic sources, occurred at the ruins that have been now re-identified as Persepolis. From Stolze's investigations, it appears that at least one of these, the castle built by Xerxes I, bears traces of having been destroyed by fire. The locality described by Diodorus Siculus after Cleitarchus corresponds in important particulars with the historic Persepolis, for example, in being supported by the mountain on the east.\n\nIt is believed that the fire which destroyed Persepolis started from Hadish Palace, which was the living quarters of Xerxes I, and spread to the rest of the city. It is not clear if the fire was an accident or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the second Persian invasion of Greece. Many historians argue that, while Alexander's army celebrated with a symposium, they decided to take revenge against the Persians. If that is so, then the destruction of Persepolis could be both an accident and a case of revenge.\n\nThe \"Book of Arda Wiraz\", a Zoroastrian work composed in the 3rd or 4th century, describes Persepolis' archives as containing \"all the Avesta and Zend, written upon prepared cow-skins, and with gold ink\", which were destroyed. Indeed, in his \"Chronology of the Ancient Nations\", the native Iranian writer Biruni indicates unavailability of certain native Iranian historiographical sources in the post-Achaemenid era, especially during the Parthian Empire. He adds: \"[Alexander] burned the whole of Persepolis as revenge to the Persians, because it seems the Persian King Xerxes had burnt the Greek City of Athens around 150 years ago. People say that, even at the present time, the traces of fire are visible in some places.\"\n\nParadoxically, the event that caused the destruction of these texts may have resulted in the preservation of the Persepolis Administrative Archives, which might otherwise have been lost over time to natural and man-made events. According to archaeological evidence, the partial burning of Persepolis did not affect what are now referred to as the \"Persepolis Fortification Archive\" tablets, but rather may have caused the eventual collapse of the upper part of the northern fortification wall that preserved the tablets until their recovery by the Oriental Institute's archaeologists.\n\nIn 316 BC, Persepolis was still the capital of Persia as a province of the great Macedonian Empire (see Diod. xix, 21 seq., 46; probably after Hieronymus of Cardia, who was living about 326). The city must have gradually declined in the course of time. The lower city at the foot of the imperial city might have survived for a longer time; but the ruins of the Achaemenids remained as a witness to its ancient glory. It is probable that the principal town of the country, or at least of the district, was always in this neighborhood.\n\nAbout 200 BC, the city of Estakhr, five kilometers north of Persepolis, was the seat of the local governors. From there, the foundations of the second great Persian Empire were laid, and there Estakhr acquired special importance as the center of priestly wisdom and orthodoxy. The Sasanian kings have covered the face of the rocks in this neighborhood, and in part even the Achaemenid ruins, with their sculptures and inscriptions. They must themselves have been built largely there, although never on the same scale of magnificence as their ancient predecessors. The Romans knew as little about Estakhr as the Greeks had known about Persepolis, despite the fact that the Sasanians maintained relations for four hundred years, friendly or hostile, with the empire.\n\nAt the time of the Muslim invasion of Persia, Estakhr offered a desperate resistance. It was still a place of considerable importance in the first century of Islam, although its greatness was speedily eclipsed by the new metropolis of Shiraz. In the 10th century, Estakhr dwindled to insignificance, as seen from the descriptions of Estakhri, a native (c. 950), and of Al-Muqaddasi (c. 985). During the following centuries, Estakhr gradually declined, until it ceased to exist as a city.\n\nOdoric of Pordenone passed through Persepolis on his way to China in 1320. In 1474, Giosafat Barbaro visited the ruins of Persepolis, which he incorrectly thought were of Jewish origin. António de Gouveia from Portugal wrote about cuneiform inscriptions following his visit in 1602. His first written report on Persia, the \"Jornada\", was published in 1606.\n\nIn 1618, García de Silva Figueroa, King Philip III of Spain's ambassador to the court of Abbas I, the Safavid monarch, was the first Western traveler to correctly identify the ruins of Persepolis as the location of Persepolis.\n\nPietro Della Valle visited Persepolis in 1621, and noticed that only 25 of the 72 original columns were still standing, due to either vandalism or natural processes. The Dutch traveler Cornelis de Bruijn visited Persepolis in 1704.\n\nThe fruitful region was covered with villages until its frightful devastation in the 18th century; and even now it is, comparatively speaking, well cultivated. The Castle of Estakhr played a conspicuous part as a strong fortress, several times, during the Muslim period. It was the middlemost and the highest of the three steep crags which rise from the valley of the Kur, at some distance to the west or northwest of the necropolis of Naqsh-e Rustam.\n\nFrench voyagers Eugène Flandin and Pascal Coste are among the first to provide not only a literary review of the structure of Persepolis, but also to create some of the best and earliest visual depictions of its structure. In their publications in Paris, in 1881 and 1882, titled \"Voyages en Perse de MM. Eugene Flanin peintre et Pascal Coste architecte\", the authors provided some 350 ground breaking illustrations of Persepolis. French influence and interest in Persia's archaeological findings would not end until the time of Reza Shah, when such distinguished figures as André Godard helped create Iran's first heritage museum.\n\nThroughout the 1800s and early 1900s, a variety of amateur digging occurred at the site, in some cases on a large scale.\n\nThe first scientific excavations at Persepolis were carried out by Ernst Herzfeld and Erich Schmidt representing the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. They conducted excavations for eight seasons, beginning in 1930, and included other nearby sites.\nHerzfeld believed that the reasons behind the construction of Persepolis were the need for a majestic atmosphere, a symbol for the empire, and to celebrate special events, especially the \"Nowruz\". For historical reasons, Persepolis was built where the Achaemenid dynasty was founded, although it was not the center of the empire at that time.\n\nExcavations of plaque fragments hint at a scene with a contest between Herakles and Apollo, dubbed \"A Greek painting at Persepolis\".\n\nPersepolitan architecture is noted for its use of the Persian column, which was probably based on earlier wooden columns. Architects resorted to stone only when the largest cedars of Lebanon or teak trees of India did not fulfill the required sizes. Column bases and capitals were made of stone, even on wooden shafts, but the existence of wooden capitals is probable.\n\nThe buildings at Persepolis include three general groupings: military quarters, the treasury, and the reception halls and occasional houses for the King. Noted structures include the Great Stairway, the Gate of All Nations, the Apadana, the Hall of a Hundred Columns, the Tripylon Hall and the Tachara, the Hadish Palace, the Palace of Artaxerxes III, the Imperial Treasury, the Royal Stables, and the Chariot House.\n\nRuins of a number of colossal buildings exist on the terrace. All are constructed of dark-grey marble. Fifteen of their pillars stand intact. Three more pillars have been re-erected since 1970. Several of the buildings were never finished. F. Stolze has shown that some of the mason's rubbish remains.\n\nSince the time of Pietro Della Valle, it has been beyond dispute that these ruins represent the Persepolis captured and partly destroyed by Alexander the Great.\n\nBehind the compound at Persepolis, there are three sepulchers hewn out of the rock in the hillside. The facades, one of which is incomplete, are richly decorated with reliefs. About 13 km NNE, on the opposite side of the Pulvar River, rises a perpendicular wall of rock, in which four similar tombs are cut at a considerable height from the bottom of the valley. Modern-day Iranians call this place \"Naqsh-e Rustam\" (\"Rustam Relief\"), from the Sasanian reliefs beneath the opening, which they take to be a representation of the mythical hero Rostam. It may be inferred from the sculptures that the occupants of these seven tombs were kings. An inscription on one of the tombs declares it to be that of Darius I, concerning whom Ctesias relates that his grave was in the face of a rock, and could only be reached by the use of ropes. Ctesias mentions further, with regard to a number of Persian kings, either that their remains were brought \"to the Persians,\" or that they died there.\n\nThe Gate of All Nations, referring to subjects of the empire, consisted of a grand hall that was a square of approximately in length, with four columns and its entrance on the Western Wall. There were two more doors, one to the south which opened to the Apadana yard and the other opened onto a long road to the east. Pivoting devices found on the inner corners of all the doors indicate that they were two-leafed doors, probably made of wood and covered with sheets of ornate metal.\n\nA pair of lamassus, bulls with the heads of bearded men, stand by the western threshold. Another pair, with wings and a \"Persian Head\" (\"Gopät-Shäh\"), stands by the eastern entrance, to reflect the power of the empire.\n\nThe name of Xerxes I was written in three languages and carved on the entrances, informing everyone that he ordered it to be built.\n\nDarius I built the greatest palace at Persepolis on the western side of platform. This palace was called the \"Apadana\". The King of Kings used it for official audiences. The work began in 518 BC, and his son, Xerxes I, completed it 30 years later. The palace had a grand hall in the shape of a square, each side long with seventy-two columns, thirteen of which still stand on the enormous platform. Each column is high with a square Taurus (bull) and plinth. The columns carried the weight of the vast and heavy ceiling. The tops of the columns were made from animal sculptures such as two-headed lions, eagles, human beings and cows (cows were symbols of fertility and abundance in ancient Iran). The columns were joined to each other with the help of oak and cedar beams, which were brought from Lebanon. The walls were covered with a layer of mud and stucco to a depth of 5 cm, which was used for bonding, and then covered with the greenish stucco which is found throughout the palaces.\n\nFoundation tablets of gold and silver were found in two deposition boxes in the foundations of the Palace. They contained an inscription by Darius in Old Persian cuneiform, which describes the extent of his Empire in broad geographical terms, and is known as the DPh inscription: \n\nAt the western, northern and eastern sides of the palace, there were three rectangular porticos each of which had twelve columns in two rows of six. At the south of the grand hall, a series of rooms were built for storage. Two grand Persepolitan stairways were built, symmetrical to each other and connected to the stone foundations. To protect the roof from erosion, vertical drains were built through the brick walls. In the four corners of Apadana, facing outwards, four towers were built.\n\nThe walls were tiled and decorated with pictures of lions, bulls, and flowers. Darius ordered his name and the details of his empire to be written in gold and silver on plates, which were placed in covered stone boxes in the foundations under the Four Corners of the palace. Two Persepolitan style symmetrical stairways were built on the northern and eastern sides of Apadana to compensate for a difference in level. Two other stairways stood in the middle of the building. The external front views of the palace were embossed with carvings of the Immortals, the Kings' elite guards. The northern stairway was completed during the reign of Darius I, but the other stairway was completed much later.\n\nThe reliefs on the staircases allow one to observe the people from across the empire in their traditional dress, and even the king himself, \"down to the smallest detail\".\n\nThe Apadana hoard is a hoard of coins that were discovered under the stone boxes containing the foundation tablets of the Apadana Palace in Persepolis. The coins were discovered in excavations in 1933 by Erich Schmidt, in two deposits, each deposit under the two deposition boxes that were found. The deposition of this hoard is dated to circa 515 BCE. The coins consisted in eight gold lightweight Croeseids, a tetradrachm of Abdera, a stater of Aegina and three double-sigloi from Cyprus. The Croeseids were found in very fresh condition, confirming that they had been recently minted under Achaemenid rule. The deposit did not have any Darics and Sigloi, which also suggests strongly that these coins typical of Achaemenid coinage only started to be minted later, after the foundation of the Apadana Palace.\n\nNext to the Apadana, second largest building of the Terrace and the final edifices, is the Throne Hall or the Imperial Army's \"Hall of Honor\" (also called the \"Hundred-Columns Palace\"). This 70x70 square meter hall was started by Xerxes I and completed by his son Artaxerxes I by the end of the fifth century BC. Its eight stone doorways are decorated on the south and north with reliefs of throne scenes and on the east and west with scenes depicting the king in combat with monsters. Two colossal stone bulls flank the northern portico. The head of one of the bulls now resides in the Oriental Institute in Chicago.\n\nAt the beginning of the reign of Xerxes I, the Throne Hall was used mainly for receptions for military commanders and representatives of all the subject nations of the empire. Later, the Throne Hall served as an imperial museum.\n\nOther palaces included the Tachara, which was built under Darius I, and the Imperial treasury, which was started by Darius I in 510 BC and finished by Xerxes I in 480 BC. The Hadish Palace of Xerxes I occupies the highest level of terrace and stands on the living rock. The Council Hall, the Tryplion Hall, the Palaces of D, G, H, storerooms, stables and quarters, the unfinished gateway and a few miscellaneous structures at Persepolis are located near the south-east corner of the terrace, at the foot of the mountain.\n\nIt is commonly accepted that Cyrus the Great was buried in Pasargadae, which is mentioned by Ctesias as his own city. If it is true that the body of Cambyses II was brought home \"to the Persians,\" his burying place must be somewhere beside that of his father. Ctesias assumes that it was the custom for a king to prepare his own tomb during his lifetime. Hence, the kings buried at Naghsh-e Rostam are probably Darius I, Xerxes I, Artaxerxes I and Darius II. Xerxes II, who reigned for a very short time, could scarcely have obtained so splendid a monument, and still less could the usurper Sogdianus. The two completed graves behind the compound at Persepolis would then belong to Artaxerxes II and Artaxerxes III. The unfinished tomb, a kilometer away from the city, is debated to who it belongs. It is perhaps that of Artaxerxes IV, who reigned at the longest two years, or, if not his, then that of Darius III (Codomannus), who is one of those whose bodies are said to have been brought \"to the Persians.\" Since Alexander the Great is said to have buried Darius III at Persepolis, then it is likely the unfinished tomb is his.\n\nAnother small group of ruins in the same style is found at the village of Haji Abad, on the Pulvar River, a good hour's walk above Persepolis. These formed a single building, which was still intact 900 years ago, and was used as the mosque of the then-existing city of Estakhr.\n\nThe relevant passages from ancient scholars on the subject are set out below:\n\nThere is, however, one formidable difficulty. Diodorus Siculus says that the rock at the back of the palace containing the royal sepulchers is so steep that the bodies could be raised to their last resting-place only by mechanical appliances. This is not true of the graves behind the compound, to which, as F. Stolze expressly observes, one can easily ride up. On the other hand, it is strictly true of the graves at Naqsh-e Rustam. Stolze accordingly started the theory that the royal castle of Persepolis stood close by Naqsh-e Rustam, and has sunk in course of time to shapeless heaps of earth, under which the remains may be concealed.\n\nIn 1971, Persepolis was the main staging ground for the \"2,500 Year Celebration of the Persian Empire\" under the reign of the Pahlavi dynasty. It included delegations from foreign nations in an attempt to advance the Iranian culture and history.\n\nConstruction of the Sivand Dam, named after the nearby town of Sivand, began on 19 September 2006. Despite 10 years of planning, Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization was not aware of the broad areas of flooding during much of this time, and there is growing concern about the effects the dam will have on the surrounding areas of Persepolis.\n\nMany archaeologists worry that the dam's placement between the ruins of Pasargadae and Persepolis will flood both. Engineers involved with the construction deny this claim, stating that it is impossible, because both sites sit well above the planned waterline. Of the two sites, Pasargadae is considered the more threatened.\n\nArchaeologists are also concerned that an increase in humidity caused by the lake will speed Pasargadae's gradual destruction. However, experts from the Ministry of Energy believe this would be negated by controlling the water level of the dam reservoir.\n\nA number of bas-reliefs from Persepolis are kept at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England. There is also a collection from Persepolis at the British Museum. The Persepolis bull at the Oriental Institute is one of the university's most prized treasures, but it is only one of several objects from Persepolis on display at the University of Chicago. New York City's Metropolitan Museum houses objects from Persepolis, as does the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology of the University of Pennsylvania. The Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon and the Louvre of Paris hold objects from Persepolis as well.\n\n\n\n"}

The abstract piece integrates in itself the fundamental concepts inside the artist’s labor. The dialogue between matter and space; the creation of sites; the organic nature of forms; and a strong ethical content are all notions that conform Chillida’s body of work. The three asymmetrical steel plates that compose the sculpture are linked to each other through a complex riveting system, which delimitates in its interior a place for human encounters. The artist plays with the scale and invites us to enter the interior space of the work. Once inside, its undulant forms appear to acquire movement, raising up in search of the light.\n"}

Viswanath and produced by Edida Nageswara Rao, starring Kamal Haasan, Jaya Prada, Sarath Babu, S. P. Sailaja and Chakri Toleti. Upon release, the film received positive reviews and became a box office hit. The film has received two National Film Awards, three Filmfare Awards South and the Nandi Award for Best Feature Film (Bronze). The film is listed among CNN-IBN's list of 100 greatest Indian films of all time.\n\nThe film was dubbed into Tamil and Malayalam and released as \"Salangai Oli\" and \"Sagara Sangamam\" respectively. Kamal Haasan had lent his voice for all three versions. The film was screened at the International Film Festival of India in 1984, retrospective in 2011 and \"Celebrating Dance in Indian cinema\" section in 2014. The film was dubbed into Russian, and was screened at the Moscow International Film Festival, Asia Pacific Film Festival and AISFM Film Festival. \"Salangai Oli\" was released on the same day as \"Sagara Sangamam\".\n\nBalakrishna (Kamal Haasan) is an economically disadvantaged but multi-talented dancer, adept at the Indian classical dances of Kuchipudi, Bharatanatyam, Kathak, etc. Fondly called Balu, his simple and very honest soul does not permit him to attain professional success in the commercial world that requires a certain level of moral laxness. Madhavi (Jaya Prada), a wealthy young woman and a dance patron, notices his talent and acts as his benefactress, helping him secure an opportunity to participate in a high-level classical dance festival.\n\nBalu's aging mother passes away from the afflictions of poverty two days before the performance. Balu, who was very attached to her, is emotionally devastated and fails to participate in the dance festival. Madhavi nevertheless, gives him support and encouragement and sets him on the mend. Balu gradually develops a fondness for Madhavi as their relationship grows. He hides his love for her, but eventually picks up the courage to express it. Balu discovers that, while Madhavi shares his feelings, she is a married woman separated from her husband. The husband later returns to unite Madhavi and Balu, but Balu decides to sacrifice his love showing respect for the institution of marriage.\n\nThe years pass, and Balu, a disappointed man, has become an inconsolable alcoholic and a newspaper journalist/art critic. Meanwhile, Madhavi's husband dies, and she hears about Balu's condition. In a bid to revive his will to live and his passion for his art, she tends to his medical needs through his friend Raghu (Sarath Babu) and solicits Balu to be the dance master for her daughter, Sailaja (SP Sailaja).\n\nThe film ends with Sailaja's stage performance with Balu watching her in a wheelchair, his health having completely deteriorated dies. Raghu is seen taking him away quietly, without interrupting the performance. Madhavi follows him with an umbrella covering Balu from the rain.\n\n\n\nKamal and R. C. Sakthi wanted to make a film on a subject, about a dancer who was an alcoholic, which they named \"Anupallavi\", when K. Viswanath approached him with a similar subject, Kamal felt he had to do the film. On the sets of the film, Gopi Krishna, one of the choreographers, insisted that Kamal should train for at least a month. Kamal was one of the top stars of the time, doing multiple shifts, and had to find the time. Kamal said it was the \"greatest sacrifice from my side\". Playback singer S. P. Sailaja was recruited to play a prominent role, thereby making her debut as an actress and it also remains her only film she had acted in so far. K. Viswanath who is related to Sailaja, decided that she would fit perfectly in the role of Kamal Haasan's pupil, after seeing the photos. Sailaja recalled: \"I was reluctant as I was trained only in Bharatanatyam, but in the film I had to perform other dance forms like Kathak too. While shooting my introductory song \"Om Namah Shivaya\" at Ravindra Bharathi, I became nervous on the stage and refused to act\". Chakri Toleti did the role of a photographer boy in the film. Thotta Tharani said that the budget was drastically cut for the song in which Kamal dances on the well.\n\nThe film score and soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraja. The lyrics for theTelugu version were written by Veturi, while Vairamuthu has written the lyrics for the Tamil version. The song \"Vedam Anuvanavuna\" is based on Hamsanandi Raga. The song \"Om Nama Sivaya\" is based on Hindolam Raga. The song \"Naada Vinodam\" is based on Sriranjini Raga. The song \"Balakanakamaya\" is based on a Thyagaraja kirtana and was composed on Atana Raga. The song \"Thakita Thadimi\" is based on Shanmughapriya Raga. Both \"Mounamelanoyi Ee Marapurani Reyi\" and \"Vevela Gopemmala\" are based on Mohana raga.\n"}
{"id": "1239220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1239220", "title": "Sauwastika", "text": "Sauwastika\n\nThe term sauwastika (or \"sauvastika\") (as a character: 卍) is sometimes used to distinguish the left-facing from the right-facing swastika symbol, a meaning which developed in 19th century scholarship.\n\nThe left-facing variant is favoured in Bön and Gurung Dharma; it is called \"yungdrung\" in Bon and \"Gurung Yantra\" in Gurung Dharma. Both the right-facing and left-facing variants are employed in Hinduism and Buddhism; however, the \"left-facing\" is more commonly used in Buddhism than Hinduism and the right-facing is more commonly used in Hinduism than Buddhism.\n\nIn Buddhism the left-facing sauwastika is imprinted on the chest, feet, palms of Buddha and also the first of the 65 auspicious symbols on the footprint of the Buddha. In Hinduism the left-facing sauwastika is associated with esoteric tantric practices and often stands for Goddess Kali.\n\nSanskrit \"sauvastika\" is the adjective derived from \"svastika\" through the standard process of vṛddhi of the vowel \"u\" in the initial syllable. (\"Svastika\" is the transformation of \"su asti\" + \"ka\" through sandhi. Vrddhi applies to the original form before sandhi.) It is attested as an adjective meaning \"benedictive, salutatory\". The connection to a \"reversed\" \"svastika\" is probably first made by Eugène Burnouf in 1852, and taken up by Schliemann in \"Ilios\" (1880), based on a letter from Max Müller, who is in turn quoting Burnouf. The term \"sauwastika\" is used in the sense of \"backwards swastika\" by Eugène Goblet d'Alviella (1894): \"In India it [the \"gammadion\"] bears the name of \"swastika\", when its arms are bent towards the right, and \"sauwastika\" when they are turned in the other direction.\"\n\nThe term has been misspelled as \"suavastika\", a term attributed to Max Müller by Wilson (1896).\nWilson finds that \"The 'suavastika' which Max Müller names and believes was applied to the swastika sign, with the ends bent to the left ... seems not to be reported with that meaning by any other author except Burnouf.\"\n\nEugene Burnouf, the first Western expert on Buddhism, stated in his book \"Lotus de la bonne loi\" (1852) that the \"sauvastika\" was a Buddhist variant of the \"svastika\".\n\nWhen Heinrich Schliemann discovered swastika motifs in Troy, he wrote to the Indologist Max Müller, who, quoting Burnouf, confirmed this distinction, adding that \"the \"svastika\" was originally a symbol of the sun, perhaps of the vernal sun as opposed to the autumnal sun, the \"sauvastika\", and, therefore, a natural symbol of light, life, health, peace and wealth.\" The letter was published in Schliemann's book \"Ilios\" (1880):\nThe term \"sauvastika\" thus cannot be confirmed as authentic and is probably due to Burnouf (1852). Notions that sauwastikas are considered \"evil\" or inauspicious versions of the auspicious swastika in Indian religions have even less substance, since even Burnouf counts the svastika and the sauvastika equally among the \"sixty-five auspicious signs\".\n\nD'Alviella (1894) voices doubts about the distinction:\nAlthough the more common form is the right-facing swastika, the symbol is used in both orientations for the sake of balance in Hinduism. Buddhists almost always use the left-facing swastika.\n\nThe sauwastika was a favorite symbol of the last Russian Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. She put this sign everywhere for good luck. In particular, she drew it with a pencil on the wall, at the window opening, and on the wallpaper above the bed of her son Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich in Ipatiev House, where the murdered Emperor's family spent the last days of their lives.\n\n\n"}

It's like Reformation theatre when people were buying oranges to throw at the actors – why shouldn’t they have fun.\"\n\nReviews for the musical have been mainly positive.\n\n\n"}

Ṭus, 17 February 1201/d. Baghdad, 25 June 1274), honored as polymath and vizier, whose significant works in literary, theological and scientific disciplines later earned him the title of Moʿallem-al-ṯāleṯ, i.e., the third teacher, following Aristotle and Farabi.\n\n\"Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat\" is the last book written by Avicenna and the most prominent. The book is on logic,natural philosophy and theology and metaphysics.Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat could be considered as generally as a later works and therefore an expression of Avicenna's mature thought. Ibn sina advice that book to his disciples as a kind of work book. In this book ibn Sina try to offer suggestion by which he call for his disciples to establish in the right way the conclusions and/or the premises to reach conclusions. In other words, Avicenna doesn't intend to develop fully articulated arguments in Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat. This makes it very abstract and demanding text for any reader, a text is not easy to understand.\n\nSharh \"Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat\" or commentary of \"Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat\" is a collection of books written by Nasir ad-Dìn al-Tùsì for detailing and defending of Avicenna's work in front of fakhr Razi. \naccording to Hosein Nasr, the influence of Fakhr al din Razi and his technical discussions of later Islamic philosophy was not recogonzed until now. Razi had important attack against peripatetic philosophy. This attack manifested on detailed in the book of sharh al Isharat which is written in the criticism of Avicenna's Al Isharat. Nasir Al Din to which book has written the responses that resuscitated Avicennian philosophy. In the fourteenth century this central debate was carried further by Qubal-Din al-Razy in his al-Muhakamهt (Trials), in which he sought to judge between the commentaries of Fakhr al-Din al-Razy and TUsi.\nthis collection until day counted as the most commentary on the book of admonitions and remarks and later men of wisdom had explain and develop it.Avicenna’s Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat was well known in philosophical circles, and numerous commentaries, glosses, and summaries had been written on it. One of the earliest commentaries was perhaps Shahrastani’s (d. 445/1153) polemical I'tiqadat 'alkalam al-isarat, to which 'Umar ibn Sahlan as-Sawi (d. ca. 549/1145) eventually wrote a reply.25 Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi (d. 606/1209) then wrote his famous ”sarh˙ al-I“isharat and an abridged version of its essential theses, titled Lubab al-I“isharat.Sa'd ibn Oasan ibn Hibat Allah (Mu˙ammad) Ibn Kammuna al-Isra'ili (d. 676/1277) wrote a sarh˙ al-I“isharat. Nasir ad-Din a†-ˇusi (672/1274) wrote a ” sarh˙ al-I\"isharat, as well as hall mus\"kilat al-I\"isharat. Although a number of these scholars knew Persian, these works were all written in Arabic, and no Persian medieval translation of al-I\"isharat has been recorded by Brockelmann. Tūsī wrote supercommentaries on Rāzī’s commentary. Their supercommentaries sought to demonstrate a critical distance from Rāzī’s Shar h, rather than a critical distance from Avicenna’s Ishārāt.Somewhat less aggressively,Tūsī levels accusations at Rāzī that Rāzī had earlier leveled at Masʿūdī: of offering criticisms presumptuously, of not yet havingworked hard enough to understand Avicenna’s theories and arguments fully and thereby present them fairly. In the preface to his Hall Mushkilāt al-Ishārāt, after praising Avicenna extravagantly and singling out the Ishārāt as an expression of Avicenna’s ideas referred to by Tusi.\n\nthis seminal works on Peripatetic philosophy established him beyond doubt as the greatest Avicennan philosopher after the master himself. This category of the works include his rebuttals to the criticisms of Ibn Sina by al-Shahrastan’s al-Muƒari‘ah and Raz’s earlier critical commentary upon Ibn Sina’s Al-isharat wa al-tanbihat. Known\nalso as Sharh al-isharat, this work, which is a major philosophical masterpiece in both form and content, resuscitated Ibn Sina’s teachings once and for all in the East. Devoted to expounding the teachings of the master in this work refrained from expressing any views of his own except when it came to God’s knowledge of the world,where Nasir Al Din accepted the views of Suhraward, which he also knew well. The work became so famous that it in turn became the subject of many later commentaries, the most famous by Qutb al-Din al-Raz.\n"}

SND) denotes:\n\nThe Slovak National Theater is the second oldest Slovak professional theater. It has 3 ensembles (drama, opera and ballet). It was founded in 1920 after the creation of Czechoslovakia as a cooperative and became a state-run company in 1945. Between 1920 and 1945, there was also a musical ensemble. The Slovak National Theater has represented Slovak culture on its numerous tours abroad.\n\nIt was created and, in the 1920s, also run by Czech artists (e.g. Oskar Nedbal, director during 1923-1930). The first performance was the Czech opera \"Hubička\" by Bedřich Smetana on March 1, 1920. The ensembles were Slovakized only gradually. In 1932, the drama ensemble split into the \"SNT Slovak Drama Company\" led by Janko Borodáč, and into the \"SNT Czech Drama Company\", led by V. Šulc. The Czech Drama Company ceased to operate when it was forced to leave Slovakia in 1938. Since then, the drama ensemble has performed in Slovak only, but in the opera ensemble there were Czech artists even after 1945. In recent years, operas have been presented in their original languages.\n\nInitially, all 3 ensembles were active at the old Slovak National Theater building. From 1955 to early 2007, the drama company performed at the \"P. O. Hviezdoslav Theater\" and from 1962 to (?)2006 also at a chamber theater called \"Malá scéna SND\" (SNT Small Stage). Since 2007, the ensembles perform only at the old Slovak National Theater building and the new Slovak National Theater building opened in April, 2007.\n\nThe drama company was shaped by the directors Janko Borodáč, F. Hoffman, J. Jamnický, J.Budský, T. Rakovský, K. I. Zachary, P. Haspra, M. Pietor and the current one – Dušan Jamrich.\n\nThe opera ensemble was led by conductors such as Oskar Nedbal, K. Nedbal, J. Vincourek and T. Frešo, and directors including V. Šulc and M. Wasserbauer. The opera became known abroad under the leadership of Czech conductor Oskar Nedbal, who also introduced the first Slovak operas of Jozef Levoslav Bella and V. Figuš Bystrý, and under K. Nedbal, who improved the drama programme. A great boom occurred after World War II. The SNT witnessed the rise of modern Slovak opera by Eugen Suchoň, Ján Cikker, Alexander Moyzes, Tibor Andrašovan, T. Frešo, and many others. Many singers from the SNT are famous abroad, e.g. Edita Grúberová, Lucia Popp, Peter Dvorský, R. Petrák, S. Kopčák, M. Hajóssyová, E. Jenisová, J. Galla, Jozef Kundlák, and many others.\n\nThe ballet ensemble has grown from a small group in 1920 to a huge ensemble today.\n\nThis theater's names were earlier: City Theater (-)\nLocated by the Hviezdoslav Square, the Neo-Renaissance building was built in 1885–1886 during the time of Austria-Hungary, based on a design by the Viennese architects Fellner & Helmer, who designed theater buildings in 10 European countries. It was opened as the \"City Theater\" on September 22, 1886 with the opera \"Bánk bán\" of Ferenc Erkel, which is one of the most important Hungarian operas. As a sign of this event's importance, Kálmán Tisza Hungarian Prime Minister and his whole government, Mór Jókai took part in this ceremony. The gala performance was conducted by Ferenc Erkel himself. The original building was designed for 1000 spectators and was illuminated using 800 gas lamps, while the auditorium had a lustre with 64 lights. The interior was decorated, with frescos of by Pressburg/Pozsony native painter Kornél Spányik and by paintings by Munich artist Leo Lüttgendorf-Leinburg, among others. The City Theater was hired by German and Hungarian professional theater companies, but beginning in 1919 (at the creation of Czechoslovakia), it was used by Czech and later also Slovak ensembles (see above). In 1920 it became the \"Slovak National Theater\".\n\nThe new building was constructed on the site of a previous Classic style theater built in 1776, the first permanent theater building in today's Slovakia, which was demolished in 1884.\n\nPressburg native sculptor Viktor Oskar Tilgner crafted the famous Ganymede's Fountain in 1888, now located immediately in front of the theater.\n\nThe building has housed Slovak National Theater ensembles since 1920, but today only the opera and ballet ensembles are resident. It was restored between 1969 and 1972, when a new modern technical building was added behind the old building. It features a unique lustre (a special ball) with 2532 bulbs enabling the creation of millions of combinations of light pictures based on a selected programme.\n\nThe design of the new building was begun in the early 1980s, and construction started in 1986. Due to a lack of funds, the building was under construction (with long interruptions) for 21 years, which increased the planned costs from 874 million to almost 5 billion Slovak crowns (although this figure is exaggerated by the relatively high inflation of the 1990s). \nThe building was finally opened on April 14, 2007 and it houses all three ensembles of the Slovak National Theater, although the ensembles continue to use the old building in the Old Town in parallel. The building is designed to hold 1700 spectators at a time in its three sections.\n\n\n"}

The third section also displays a winged figure, armed with a spear and presumed to be an archangel, or Luke the Evangelist. (See External link for photo of carved figure.)\n\nAccording to Kendrick, this dense interlacing is distinctly Mercian in character. It shows similarities to the densely carved Wolverhampton Pillar, and the fine interlacing to be seen on the Brunswick Casket and the Witham Pins. On the other hand, Hill sees a stylistic connection with the Bewcastle Cross in Cumbria, and Byzantine influences.\n\nThe cross is now mounted on a nineteenth-century plinth, and is topped by cap and modern ball in place of the original cross-head which was lost in the eighteenth century.\n\nThe date of the cross in unclear. English Heritage describe it as eleventh-century in one of two listings, but in its other listing they suggest that high crosses of this type are likely to be eighth, ninth or tenth century.\n\nRev. A.D. Hill suggested (in 1906) a date between 680 and 780 AD, from the ornamentation style and circumstances of the times. This is the date range quoted on the information panel displayed at the site.\n\nPevsner says that the date may be as late as c.1050.\n\nThe original position of the cross in unknown, but it is likely to have been nearby.\n\nThe first records of the monument date from the eighteenth century. \nBefore 1760, the cross was lying on its side in the churchyard, around which time the cross-head was removed. With the head, the cross would have been around 3.5m high. In 1760, the cross was re-erected at the junction of Church Street and Church Lane, immediately south east of the churchyard. In 1820, it was installed on a new base at the same location, and topped with a stone cap and ball (\"pictured\"). In 1916, the top ball was damaged in a storm. In 1928, the cross together with the 1820 plinth and cap was moved from the street location to the churchyard, where it now stands. In 2000, a new stone ball replaced the one damaged in 1916.\n\nThe cross may be the origin of the name 'Stapleford' which means a crossing near a post.\n\n"}

The archive is jointly administered by the Abraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Central Zionist Archives of the World Zionist Organization (WZO).\n\nThe archive was established in the late 1960s by Professor Moshe Davis and other historians of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The archive was originally called the Avraham Rad Jewish Film Archive for a number of years. In 1973, the WZO designated the archive as the official depository for its films. Since 1988, the archive has been named after the Jewish-American filmmaker Steven Spielberg, whose foundation partially finances archive activities. In 1996, the archive moved to its present premises at the university's faculty of humanities on Mount Scopus.\n\nThe archive holds approximately 16,000 titles: about 4,500 films, over 9,000 videos on various formats and roughly 600 DVDs are cataloged. The collection deals with a variety of Jewish subjects: Jewish history, the establishment of the State of Israel, immigration, Jewish communities in the Diaspora and the relationships between them and Israelis. The films come from diverse sources: primarily the WZO and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem but also other public bodies, such as the Jewish National Fund and private sources that either donate or deposit their films – mainly documentary filmmakers and their families. In addition, the archive possesses a number of collections deposited by various kibbutzim. The Steven Spielberg Archive holds the copyright for the films produced by its founding institutions – i.e., the WZO and the Hebrew University – and is authorized to sell user rights to broadcasting and production companies and all other interested parties. The films are kept in temperature controlled vaults, facilitating their preservation, as much as possible, in optimal conditions. Movies can be watched on 16 mm and 35 mm viewing tables, and on video players in U-Matic, Betacam, VHS, DVCAM, Mini DV, Super VHS and Betamax.\n\nViewers will receive a tangible and extensive picture of the development of the Jewish nation and the State of Israel during the 20th century until the present. The varied and rich collection contains several definitive moments in the history of the State and the Jewish people in the Diaspora: for example the \"First Film of Palestine\" depicts life during Ottoman rule in 1911; the film \"Five Cities\" in which five central Jewish communities were filmed in Poland, provides a concrete and chilling testament to the vibrant Jewish life existing there a few months before the Holocaust; the film \"The Day Came\" which describes the establishment of the State on 14 May 1948, includes the famous scene of the Declaration of Independence by David Ben-Gurion; there is also film of the Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Chaim Herzog, furiously tearing up the General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism.\n\nViewers can also see the establishment of different communities, both before and after the establishment of the State. Hadassah Organization presents the nascent medical profession in Israel. Films produced by the Hebrew University throughout the years, show not only the development of the University but also the changing face of Jerusalem. The film \"Edge of the West\" brings images of the Jews of Morocco, including poignant scenes of residents of an entire small Jewish village leaving on their way to Israel. In addition, influential Jewish figures, such as Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, Albert Einstein and Chaim Weizmann, among others, can be seen. The archive holds original copies of the Eichmann Trial, given by the American company that filmed the trial. The Israel State Archives granted the archive the right to distribute this material, after the original video reels were transferred to digital cassettes.\n\n\n\n"}

It is notable as (a) the first occasion on which Māori art had been exhibited by Māori (b) the first occasion on which Māori art was shown internationally as art. In retrospect it is seen as a milestone in the Māori Renaissance.\n\nIn the colonial period many Māori objects, including art, domestic objects and human remains (particularly Mokomokai) were widely collected by explorers, missionaries and scientists and were lost to the communities which had created them; largely they were lost to large European collection institutions such as the London Science Museum the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford. This alienation meant that Māori regarded many Pākeha (Western) cultural institutions with considerable skepticism and overcoming this skepticism to allow objects to be borrowed for exhibition made \"Te Maori\" a milestone.\n\nThe project was driven by Secretary for Maori Affairs, Kara Puketapu, under the auspices of the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council with funding from Mobil.\n\nThe exhibition started at the Met in New York on 10 September 1984, Saint Louis Art Museum (February–May 1985), the M.

It came to epitomise the culture of heroic imperialism in late Victorian Britain and in British popular culture up to the mid-twentieth century .\n\nThe painting depicts the young, wide-eyed Walter Raleigh and his brother sitting on the beach by the Devonshire coast. He is listening to a story of life on the seas, told by an experienced sailor who points out to the sea.\n\nThe painting was influenced by an essay written by James Anthony Froude on \"England's Forgotten Worthies\", which described the lives of Elizabethan seafarers. It was also probably influenced by a contemporaneous biography of Raleigh, which imagined his experiences listening to old sailors as a boy. Millais travelled to Budleigh Salterton to paint the location.\n\nMillais's sons Everett and George modelled for the boys. The sailor was a professional model. Millais' friend and biographer, the critic Marion Spielmann, stated that he was intended to be Genoese. He also argues that the sailor is pointing south towards the \"Spanish main\".\n\nThe painting has been parodied many times in political cartoons.\n\nIn 1928 David Low published a cartoon showing the Earl of Birkenhead (Secretary of State for India), Stanley Baldwin (Prime Minister) and Winston Churchill (Chancellor of the Exchequer) listening to \"Tales of the Dominions\" from a diminutive sailor (Leo Amery, Colonial Secretary – who was a very short man).\n\nIn 1993 the \"Sunday Telegraph\" ran \"The Boyhood of Hurd and Major\". The then Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who had recently pushed the Maastricht Treaty through Parliament against the wishes of many Conservatives, were shown as small boys in Elizabethan costume, listening as an old sailor (Sir Edward Heath) gestured towards the coast labelled \"Europe\" visible on the other side of the water. Former Prime Minister Heath – whose hobby had been yachting – had taken Britain into the EEC (as it was then called) during his premiership, and had grown up in Kent where the coast of France is visible on a clear day. At the time Heath was Father of the House of Commons and enjoying something of an Indian Summer after the ousting of his political nemesis, the eurosceptic Margaret Thatcher, as Prime Minister in 1990.\n\nIn 1999 the \"Daily Telegraph\" published a Garland cartoon, showing the then Conservative leader William Hague as a small boy (this was common in satire at the time, as Hague had first attained national fame as a teenager in the 1970s), while two old sailors – former Foreign Secretary David Owen and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey – gestured inland and away from a ship labelled \"Euro\". The two elder statesmen described themselves as pro-European but opposed to British membership of the Single Currency.\n\nThe picture has also appeared in recent explorations of postcolonialism, most notably Salman Rushdie's novel \"Midnight's Children\", in which the narrator Saleem Sinai partly misremembers and transforms the meaning of the painting, a copy of which hung on his bedroom wall when he was a child.\n\nElements of the picture appear on the cover of the Talk Talk album \"It's My Life\".\n\nThe painting is also reproduced in part on the cover of the 1982 single \"Almost With You/Life Speeds Up\" by The Church.\n"}
{"id": "782056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=782056", "title": "The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter", "text": "The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\n\nThe tale is also known as , after its protagonist. It primarily details the life of a mysterious girl called Kaguya, who was discovered as a baby inside the stalk of a glowing bamboo plant.\n\nOne day, while walking in the bamboo forest, an old, childless bamboo cutter called came across a mysterious, shining stalk of bamboo. After cutting it open, he found inside it an infant the size of his thumb. He rejoiced to find such a beautiful girl and took her home. He and his wife raised her as their own child and named her Kaguya-hime (かぐや姫 accurately, Nayotake no Kaguya-hime, \"Shining princess of the supple bamboo\"). Thereafter, Taketori no Okina found that whenever he cut down a stalk of bamboo, inside would be a small nugget of gold. Soon he became rich. Kaguya-hime grew from a small baby into a woman of ordinary size and extraordinary beauty. At first, Taketori no Okina tried to keep her away from outsiders, but over time the news of her beauty spread.\n\nEventually, five princes came to Taketori no Okina's residence to ask for the beautiful Kaguya-hime's hand in marriage. The princes eventually persuaded Taketori no Okina to tell a reluctant Kaguya-hime to choose from among them. Kaguya-hime concocted impossible tasks for the princes, agreeing to marry the one who managed to bring her his specified item. That night, Taketori no Okina told the five princes what each must bring. The first was told to bring her the stone begging bowl of the Buddha Shakyamuni from India, the second a jeweled branch from the mythical island of Hōrai, the third the legendary robe of the fire-rat of China, the fourth a colored jewel from a dragon's neck, and the final prince a cowry shell born of swallows.\n\nRealizing that it was an impossible task, the first prince returned with an expensive stone bowl, hoping that Kaguya-hime would believe it to be real, but after noticing that the bowl did not glow with holy light, Kaguya-hime saw through his deception. Likewise, two other princes attempted to deceive her with fakes, but also failed. The fourth gave up after encountering a storm, while the final prince lost his life (severely injured in some versions) in his attempt.\n\nAfter this, the Emperor of Japan, Mikado, came to see the strangely beautiful Kaguya-hime and, upon falling in love, asked her to marry him. Although he was not subjected to the impossible trials that had thwarted the princes, Kaguya-hime rejected his request for marriage as well, telling him that she was not of his country and thus could not go to the palace with him. She stayed in contact with the Emperor, but continued to rebuff his requests and marriage proposals.\n\nThat summer, whenever Kaguya-hime saw the full moon, her eyes filled with tears. Though her adoptive parents worried greatly and questioned her, she was unable to tell them what was wrong. Her behaviour became increasingly erratic until she revealed that she was not of this world and must return to her people on the Moon. In some versions of this tale, it is said that she was sent to the Earth, where she would inevitably form material attachment, as a temporary punishment for some crime, while in others, she was sent to Earth for her own safety during a celestial war. The gold that Taketori no Okina had been finding had in fact been a stipend from the people of the Moon, sent down to pay for Kaguya-hime's upkeep.\nAs the day of her return approached, the Emperor sent many guards around her house to protect her from the Moon people, but when an embassy of \"Heavenly Beings\" arrived at the door of Taketori no Okina's house, the guards were blinded by a strange light. Kaguya-hime announced that, though she loved her many friends on Earth, she must return with the Moon people to her true home. She wrote sad notes of apology to her parents and to the Emperor, then gave her parents her own robe as a memento. She then took a little of the elixir of life, attached it to her letter to the Emperor, and gave it to a guard officer. As she handed it to him, her feather robe was placed on her shoulders, and all of her sadness and compassion for the people of the Earth were apparently forgotten. The heavenly entourage took Kaguya-hime back to \"Tsuki no Miyako\" (月の都; lit. \"the Capital of the Moon\"), leaving her earthly foster parents in tears.\nThe parents became very sad and were soon put to bed sick. The officer returned to the Emperor with the items Kaguya-hime had given him as her last mortal act, and reported what had happened. The Emperor read her letter and was overcome with sadness. He asked his servants, \"Which mountain is the closest place to Heaven?\", to which one replied the Great Mountain of Suruga Province. The Emperor ordered his men to take the letter to the summit of the mountain and burn it, in the hope that his message would reach the distant princess. The men were also commanded to burn the elixir of immortality since the Emperor did not wish to live forever without being able to see her. The legend has it that the word \"immortality\", 不死 (\"fushi\"), became the name of the mountain, Mount Fuji. It is also said that the kanji for the mountain, 富士山 (literally \"Mountain Abounding with Warriors\"), are derived from the Emperor's army ascending the slopes of the mountain to carry out his order. It is said that the smoke from the burning still rises to this day. (In the past, Mount Fuji was much more volcanically active and therefore produced more smoke.)\n\nElements of the tale were drawn from earlier stories. The protagonist Taketori no Okina, given by name, appears in the earlier poetry collection \"Man'yōshū\" (c. 759; poem# 3791). In it, he meets a group of women to whom he recites a poem. This indicates that there previously existed an image or tale revolving around a bamboo cutter and celestial or mystical women.\n\nA similar retelling of the tale appears in the c. 12th century Konjaku Monogatarishū (volume 31, chapter 33), although their relation is under debate.\n\nIn 1957, \"Jinyu Fenghuang\" (金玉鳳凰), a Chinese book of Tibetan tales, was published.\nIn early 1970s, Japanese literary researchers became aware that \"Banzhu Guniang\" (班竹姑娘), one of the tales in the book, had certain similarities with \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\". Initially, many researchers thought that \"Banzhu Guniang\" must be related to \"Tale of Bamboo Cutter\", although some were skeptical.\n\nIn 1980s, studies showed that the relationship is not as simple as initially thought. Okutsu provides extensive review of the research, and notes that the book \"Jinyu Fenghuang\" was intended to be for children, and as such, the editor took some liberties in adapting the tales. No other compilation of Tibetan tales contains the story.\n\nA Tibet-born person wrote that he did not know the story. A researcher went to Sichuan and found that, apart from those who had already read \"Jinyu Fenghuang\", local researchers in Chengdu did not know the story.

{"id": "29960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29960", "title": "Trade secret", "text": "Trade secret\n\nA trade secret is a formula, practice, process, design, instrument, pattern, commercial method, or compilation of information not generally known or reasonably ascertainable by others by which a business can obtain an economic advantage over competitors or customers. In some jurisdictions, such secrets are referred to as \"confidential information\".\n\nThe precise language by which a trade secret is defined varies by jurisdiction, as do the particular types of information that are subject to trade secret protection. Three factors are common to all such definitions: \n\nA trade secret is information that\n\n\nIn international law, these three factors define a trade secret under article 39 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, commonly referred to as the TRIPS Agreement.\n\nSimilarly, in the United States Economic Espionage Act of 1996, \"A trade secret, as defined under (3)(A),(B) (1996), has three parts: (1) information; (2) reasonable measures taken to protect the information; and (3) which derives independent economic value from not being publicly known.\"\n\nTrade secrets are an important, but invisible component of a company's intellectual property (IP). Their contribution to a company's value, measured as its market capitalization, can be major. Being invisible, that contribution is hard to measure. Patents are a visible contribution, but delayed, and unsuitable for internal innovations. Having an internal scoreboard provides insight into the cost of risks of employees leaving to serve or start competing ventures.\n\nIn contrast to registered intellectual property, trade secrets are, by definition, not disclosed to the world at large. Instead, owners of trade secrets seek to protect trade secret information from competitors by instituting special procedures for handling it, as well as technological and legal security measures. Legal protections include non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), and work-for-hire and non-compete clauses. In other words, in exchange for an opportunity to be employed by the holder of secrets, an employee may sign agreements to not reveal their prospective employer's proprietary information, to surrender or assign to their employer ownership rights to intellectual work and work-products produced during the course (or as a condition) of employment, and to not work for a competitor for a given period of time (sometimes within a given geographic region). Violation of the agreement generally carries the possibility of heavy financial penalties which operate as a disincentive to reveal trade secrets. However, proving a breach of an NDA by a former stakeholder who is legally working for a competitor or prevailing in a lawsuit for breaching a non-compete clause can be very difficult. A holder of a trade secret may also require similar agreements from other parties he or she deals with, such as vendors, licensees, and board members.\n\nAs a company can protect its confidential information through NDA, work-for-hire, and non-compete contracts with its stakeholders (within the constraints of employment law, including only restraint that is reasonable in geographic- and time-scope), these protective contractual measures effectively create a perpetual monopoly on secret information that does not expire as would a patent or copyright. The lack of formal protection associated with registered intellectual property rights, however, means that a third party not bound by a signed agreement is not prevented from independently duplicating and using the secret information once it is discovered, such as through reverse engineering.\n\nTherefore, trade secrets such as secret formulae are often protected by restricting the key information to a few trusted individuals. Famous examples of products protected by trade secrets are Chartreuse liqueur and Coca-Cola.\n\nBecause protection of trade secrets can, in principle, extend indefinitely, it therefore may provide an advantage over patent protection and other registered intellectual property rights, which last only for a specific duration. The Coca-Cola company, for example, has no patent for the formula of Coca-Cola and has been effective in protecting it for many more years than the 20 years of protection that a patent would have provided. In fact, Coca-Cola refused to reveal its trade secret under at least two judges' orders.\n\nCompanies often try to discover one another's trade secrets through lawful methods of reverse engineering or employee poaching on one hand, and potentially unlawful methods including industrial espionage on the other. Acts of industrial espionage are generally illegal in their own right under the relevant governing laws, and penalties can be harsh. The importance of that illegality to trade secret law is: if a trade secret is acquired by improper means (a somewhat wider concept than \"illegal means\" but inclusive of such means), then the secret is generally deemed to have been \"misappropriated\". Thus, if a trade secret has been acquired via industrial espionage, its acquirer will probably be subject to legal liability for having acquired it improperly. (The holder of the trade secret is nevertheless obliged to protect against such espionage to some degree in order to safeguard the secret. Under most trade secret regimes, a trade secret is not deemed to exist unless its purported holder takes reasonable steps to maintain its secrecy.)\n\nCommentators starting with A. Arthur Schiller assert that trade secrets were protected under Roman law by a claim known as \"actio servi corrupti\", interpreted as an \"action for making a slave worse\" (or an action for corrupting a servant). The Roman law is described as follows:\n\n[T]he Roman owner of a mark or firm name was legally protected against unfair usage by a competitor through the \"actio servi corrupti\" ... which the Roman jurists used to grant commercial relief under the guise of private law actions. \"If, as the writer believes [writes Schiller], various private cases of action were available in satisfying commercial needs, the state was acting in exactly the same fashion as it does at the present day.\"\n\nThe suggestion that trade secret law has its roots in Roman law was introduced in 1929 in a \"Columbia Law Review\" article called \"Trade Secrets and the Roman Law: The \"Actio Servi Corrupti\"\", which has been reproduced in Schiller's, \"An American Experience in Roman Law\" 1 (1971). See \"Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded\", at 19. However, the University of Georgia Law School professor Alan Watson argued in \"Trade Secrets and Roman Law: The Myth Exploded \"that the \"actio servi corrupti\" was not used to protect trade secrets p. 19. Rather, he explained:\n\nSchiller is sadly mistaken as to what was going on. ... The \"actio servi corrupti\" presumably or possibly could be used to protect trade secrets and other similar commercial interests. That was not its purpose and was, at most, an incidental spin-off. But there is not the slightest evidence that the action was ever so used. In this regard the \"actio servi corrupti\" is not unique.\n\nExactly the same can be said of many private law actions including those for theft, damage to property, deposit, and production of property. All of these could, I suppose, be used to protect trade secrets, etc., but there is no evidence they were. It is bizarre to see any degree the Roman actio servi corrupti as the counterpart of modern law for the protection of trade secrets and other such commercial interests.\n\nTrade secret law as we know it today made its first appearance in England in 1817 in \"Newbery v. James\", and in the United States in 1837 in \"Vickery v. Welch\". While those cases involved the first known common law causes of action based on a modern concept of trade secret laws, neither involved injunctive relief; rather, they involved damages only. In England, the first case involving injunctive relief came in 1820 in \"Yovatt v Winyard\", while in the United States, it took until the 1866 case \"Taylor v. Blanchard\".\n\nTrade secrets law continued to evolve throughout the United States as a hodgepodge of state laws. In 1939, the American Law Institute issued the Restatement of Torts, containing a summary of trade secret laws across states, which served as the primary resource until the latter part of the century. As of 2013, however, only four states—Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Texas—still rely on the Restatement as their primary source of guidance (other than their body of state case law). It has also been recently theorized that the doctrine of trade secrets should protect competitively valuable, personal information of company executives, in a concept known as \"executive trade secrets\".\n\nIn Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right.\n\nThe Court of Appeal of England and Wales in the case of \"Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v. Campbell Engineering Ltd\" held that the action for breach of confidence is based on a principle of preserving \"good faith\".\n\nThe test for a cause of action for breach of confidence in the common law world is set out in the case of \"Coco v. A.N. Clark (Engineers) Ltd\":\n\n\nThe \"quality of confidence\" highlights that trade secrets are a legal concept. With sufficient effort or through illegal acts (such as breaking and entering), competitors can usually obtain trade secrets. However, so long as the owner of the trade secret can prove that reasonable efforts have been made to keep the information confidential, the information remains a trade secret and generally remains legally protected. Conversely, trade secret owners who cannot evidence reasonable efforts at protecting confidential information risk losing the trade secret, even if the information is obtained by competitors illegally. It is for this reason that trade secret owners shred documents and do not simply recycle them.\n\nA successful plaintiff is entitled to various forms of judicial relief, including:\n\n\nHong Kong does not follow the traditional commonwealth approach, instead recognizing trade secrets where a judgment of the High Court indicates that confidential information may be a property right.\n\nThe EU adopted a Directive on the Protection of Trade Secrets on 27 May 2016. The goal of the directive is to harmonize the definition of trade secrets in accordance with existing international standards, and the means of obtaining protection of trade secrets within the EU.\n\nWithin the U.S., trade secrets generally encompass a company's proprietary information that is not generally known to its competitors, and which provides the company with a competitive advantage.\n\nAlthough trade secrets law evolved under state common law, prior to 1974, the question of whether patent law preempted state trade secrets law had been unanswered. In 1974, the United States Supreme Court issued the landmark decision, \"Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.,\" which resolved the question in favor of allowing the states to freely develop their own trade secret laws.\n\nIn 1979 several U.S. states adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which was further amended in 1985, with approximately 47 states having adopted some variation of it as the basis for trade secret law. Another significant development is the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) of 1996 (), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. \n\nThis law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity.\nThe statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.\nThe EEA was extended in 2016 to allow companies to file civil suits in federal court.\n\nOn May 11, 2016, President Obama signed the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA), 18 U.S.C.§§1839 et seq., which for the first time created a federal cause of action for misappropriating trade secrets. The DTSA provides for both a private right of action for damages and injunction and a civil action for injunction brought by the Attorney General. \n\nThe statute followed state laws on liability in significant part, defining trade secrets in the same way as the Uniform Trade Secrets Act as,\n\nHowever, the law contains several important differences from prior law.\nThe DTSA also clarifies that a United States resident (including a company) can be liable for misappropriation that takes place outside the United States, and any person can be liable as long as an act in furtherance of the misappropriation takes place in the United States, 18 U.S.C. §1837. The DTSA provides the courts with broad injunctive powers. 18 U.S.C. §1836(b)(3).\n\nThe DTSA does not preempt or supplant state laws, but provides an additional cause of action. Because states vary significantly in their approach to the \"inevitable disclosure\" doctrine, its use has limited, if any, application under the DTSA, 18 U.S.C.§1836(b)(3)(A).\n\nIn the United States, trade secrets are not protected by law in the same manner as patents or trademarks. Specifically, trademarks and patents are protected under federal statutes, the Lanham Act and Patent Act, respectively. In contrast, trade secrets are protected under state laws, and most states have enacted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), except for Massachusetts, New York, and North Carolina. One of the differences between patents and trademarks, on the one hand, and trade secrets, on the other, is that a trade secret is protected only when the secret is \n\nNations have different trademark policies. Assuming the mark in question meets certain other standards of protectibility, trademarks are generally protected from infringement on the grounds that other uses might confuse consumers as to the origin or nature of the goods once the mark has been associated with a particular supplier. Similar considerations apply to service marks and trade dress.\n\nBy definition, a trademark enjoys no protection (\"qua\" trademark) until and unless it is \"disclosed\" to consumers, for only then are consumers able to associate it with a supplier or source in the requisite manner. (That a company plans to \"use\" a certain trademark might itself be protectible as a trade secret, however, until the mark is actually made public.)\n\nTo acquire a trademark rights under U.S. law, one must simply use the mark \"in commerce\". It is possible to register a trademark in the United States, both at the federal and state levels. Registration of trademarks confers some advantages, including stronger protection in certain respects, but registration is not required in order to get protection. Registration may be required in order to file a lawsuit for trademark infringement.\n\nTo acquire a patent, full information about the method or product has to be supplied to the patent office and upon publication or issuance, will then be available to all. After expiration of the patent, competitors can copy the method or product legally. The temporary monopoly on the subject matter of the patent is regarded as a tradeoff for thus disclosing the information to the public.\n\nOne popular misconception held by many is that trade secret protection is incompatible with patent protection. It is typically said that if one applies for a patent one can no longer maintain a trade secret on the invention, but this is an oversimplification. In order to obtain a patent, the inventor must disclose the invention, so that others will be able to both make and use the invention. Also, to obtain a patent in the United States, any preferences must likewise be disclosed. What is typically not appreciated though is that the critical time for satisfying this disclosure requirement is at the time the application is filed. In many if not most situations, improvements will be made to an invention even after filing of the patent application, and additional information will be learned. None of this additional information must be disclosed and can instead be kept as a secret. Virtually all patent licenses include clauses that require the inventor to disclose any trade secrets they have. Frequently it is this information not disclosed in the patent that is the most commercially viable. Thus, patent licensors should take steps to continue to maintain trade secrets as secrets, otherwise they will be lost. Accordingly, before disclosing any secrets not already protected by an issued patent the licensor will use a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nCompared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are that a trade secret is not limited in time (it \"continues indefinitely as long as the secret is not revealed to the public\", whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention), a trade secret does not imply any registration costs, has an immediate effect, does not require compliance with any formalities, and does not imply any disclosure of the invention to the public. The disadvantages of trade secrets include that \"others may be able to legally discover the secret and be thereafter entitled to use it\", \"others may obtain patent protection for legally discovered secrets\", and a trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent.\n\nTrade secret regulations that mask the composition of chemical agents in consumer products have been criticized for allowing the trade secret holders to hide the presence of potentially harmful and toxic substances. It has been argued that the public is being denied a clear picture of such products' safety, whereas competitors are well positioned to analyze its chemical composition. In 2004, the National Environmental Trust tested 40 common consumer products; in more than half of them they found toxic substances not listed on the product label.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1853097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853097", "title": "Well-made play", "text": "Well-made play\n\nThe well-made play (, pronounced ) is a dramatic genre from nineteenth-century theatre first codified by French dramatist Eugène Scribe. Dramatists Victorien Sardou, Alexandre Dumas, fils, and Emile Augier wrote within the genre, each putting a distinct spin on the style. The well-made play was a popular form of entertainment. By the mid-19th century, however, it had already entered into common use as a derogatory term. Henrik Ibsen and the other realistic dramatists of the later 19th century (August Strindberg, Gerhart Hauptmann, Émile Zola, Anton Chekhov) built upon its technique of careful construction and preparation of effects in the genre problem play. \"Through their example\", Marvin Carlson explains, \"the well-made play became and still remains the traditional model of play construction.\"\nIn the English language, that tradition found its early 20th-century codification in Britain in the form of William Archer's \"Play-Making: A Manual of Craftmanship\" (1912), and in the United States with George Pierce Baker's \"Dramatic Technique\" (1919).\n\nThe form has a strong Neoclassical flavour, involving a tight plot and a climax that takes place close to the end of the play. The well-made play retains the shape of Aristotle's ideal Greek-tragedy model outlined in his \"Poetics\".\n\nThe well-made play can be broken down into a specific set of criteria. First, the story depends upon a key piece of information kept from some characters, but known to others (and to the audience). Most of the story takes place before the action of the play begins, making the beginning of the play a late point of attack. Exposition during act one explains actions that precede the opening scene, and generates the audience's sympathy for the hero (or heroes) over their rival (or rivals). The plot moves forward in a chain of actions that use minor reversals of fortune to create suspense. The pace builds towards a climactic obligatory scene, in which the hero triumphs. This scene contains a climactic reversal of fortune, or peripeteia. A dénouement follows, in which all remaining plot points are unraveled and resolved.\n\nA recurrent device that the well-made play employs is the use of letters or papers falling into unintended hands, in order to bring about plot twists and climaxes. The letters bring about an unexpected and climactic reversal of fortune, in which it is often revealed that someone is not who they pretend to be. Mistaken or mysterious identity as a basis for plot complications is referred to as \"qui pro quo\".\n\nEugene Scribe contributed over 300 plays and opera libretti to the dramatic literature canon. Thirty-five of these works are considered well-made-plays.\n\nHistory of French Neoclassic form lays a critical foundation for Scribe, who draws upon devices determined by the French Academy to create his dramatic structure. French Neoclassicism conceives of Verisimilitude, or the appearance of a plausible truth, as the aesthetic goal of a play. In 1638, the French Academy codified a system by which dramatists could achieve Verisimilitude in a verdict on the Le Cid debate. The monarchy enforced the standards of French Neoclassicism with a system of censorship under which funding and practice permits were issued to a limited number of theater companies. This system underwent small modifications, but remained essentially the same up until the French Revolution. Until then, restrictive laws inhibited the growth of new practices with the exception of those advocated by a few intrepid dramatists such as Voltaire, Diderot, and Beaumarchais. After the French Revolution, adherence to the form became an artistic choice instead of a political necessity.\n\nAlthough Scribe drew heavily upon Neoclassic devices, he used them in original ways that would not have been acceptable without new popular forms, such as those developed at the Boulevard theatres. In order to work around the formal monopoly of the Comédie Française in the middle of the 18th century, theater troupes experimenting with new dramatic forms sprang up along the Boulevard du Temple. Their aim was to escape the censors, and please the public. Popular reception of the boulevard theatres' explorations helped to crack the edifice of Neoclassic form. After the French Revolution, French theater opened to the influence of practices that had meanwhile developed in other places around Europe.\n\nScribe's development of a form that could be used repeatedly to turn out new material suited the demands of a growing middle class theater audience.\n\nScribe's influence on theater, according to Marvin J. Carlson, \"cannot be overestimated\". Carlson observes that, unlike other influential theater thinkers, Scribe did not write prefaces or manifestos declaiming his ideas. Scribe influenced theater, instead, with craftsmanship. He honed a dramatic form into a reliable mould that could be applied not only to different content, but to different content from a variety of playwrights. Carlson identifies a single instance of Scribe's critical commentary from a speech Scribe gave to the Académie française in 1836. Scribe expressed his view of what draws the audiences to theater:\n\n\"not for instruction or improvement, but for diversion and distraction, and that which diverts them [audience] most is not truth, but fiction. To see again what you have before your eyes daily will not please you, but that which is not available to you in every day life - the extraordinary and the romantic.\"\n\nAlthough Scribe advocated for a theater of amusement over didacticism, other writers, beginning with Alexandre Dumas, fils, adopted Scribe's structure to create didactic plays. In a letter to a critic, Dumas \"fils\" states,\"... if I can find some means to force people to discuss the problem, and the lawmaker to revise the law, I shall have done more than my duty as a writer, I shall have done my duty as a man.\". Dumas' thesis plays are plays written in the well-made style that take clear moral positions on social issues of the day. Emile Augier also used Scribe's formula to write plays addressing contemporary social issues, although he declares his moral position less strongly.\n\nBy the late 19th century, the well-made play had fallen out of critical favor. Shaw was among those who held the form in low regard, \"Why the devil should a man write like Scribe when he can write like Shakespeare or Moliere, Aristophanes or Euripides? Who was Scribe that he should dictate to me or anyone else how a play should be written?\" In reference to the form's tendency to favor amusing plot twists over complexly drawn characters, Shaw referred to the genre as Sardoodledom after Victorien Sardou, who also wrote in the well-made style.\n\nThe opening to the preface to \"Three Plays by Brieux\" offers another example of Shavian disdain for the well-made plays. Shaw identifies the process of creating them as an industry, and their creators as “literary mechanics” instead of artists. To convey how vulgar he finds a widely used playwrighting formula, Shaw interprets the aphorism \"Art for art's sake,\" as \"Success for money's sake.\"\n\nIn an essay published in PMLA in 1951, \"Pygmalion: Bernard Shaw’s Dramatic Theory and Practice\", Milton Crane reasons that Shaw’s disparagement of the classic well-made formula, and his desire to pry Ibsen’s work away from association with the works of Scribe and Sardou, serve a specific agenda. Crane argues that Shaw aims to prevent his own use of the well-made formula from linking his plays with work considered out of fashion. Shaw’s theory of the problem play and discussion ideas align his plays with Ibsen’s, and distinguishes them from stale plays of the past. Crane observes that Shaw, by his own admission, learned dramatic structure from contemporary popular theatre which was then dominated by the well-made formula. Crane goes on to argue how that formula is present in \"Pygmalion\", \"Man and Superman\", and \"The Doctor’s Dilemma\".\n\nShaw discusses the notion of the problem play in an essay of the same title published in 1895. He defines a problem play as one that puts a person or people in conflict with an institution, confronting a contemporary social question. He cites the \"Woman question\" as a contemporary example. Ibsen's engagement with the \"Woman question\" in \"A Doll's House\" and \"Ghosts\" qualifies those works as problem plays. Shaw distinguishes between the problem play and literature with conflicts reflecting a more universal view of the human condition. Works whose fundamental conflict does not pit human against institution, he argues, are more apt to remain relevant through generations. He cites \"Hamlet\", \"Faust\", and \"Les Misérables\" as examples of stories whose conflicts involve more eternal human questions. Shaw observes that the immediacy of the institutional question addressed in a problem play will render the play \"flat as ditchwater\" once society progresses and the issue is resolved. Although Ibsen was hailed by feminists, he did not regard himself as an advocate for any particular group.\n\nIbsen's aim, according to Raymond Williams, was to express tragedies in the human condition. Ibsen qualifies a human tragedy as the state \"[when a person] stands in a tight place; he cannot go forwards or backwards.” Williams also cites the specific characteristic that distinguishes his and Ibsen's modern drama from the preceding well-made formula. The well-made formula, Shaw observes, can be divided into three sections: Exposition, Situation, Unraveling. The plays of Ibsen and Shaw, Shaw himself asserts, do not end with a classic unraveling. Their work can be divided as: Exposition, Situation, Discussion.\n\nOscar Wilde's \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" exaggerates many of the conventions of the well-made play, such as the missing papers conceit (the hero, as an infant, was confused with the manuscript of a novel) and a final revelation (which, in this play, occurs about thirty seconds before the final curtain).\n\nHenrik Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\" follows most of the conceits of the well-made play, but transcends the genre when, after incriminating papers are recovered, Nora rejects the expected return to normality. Several of Ibsen's subsequent plays build on the general construction principles of the well-made play. \"The Wild Duck\" (1884) can be seen as a deliberate, meta-theatrical deconstruction of the Scribean formula. Ibsen sought a compromise between Naturalism and the well-made play which was fraught with difficulties since life does not fall easily into either form.\n\nAlthough George Bernard Shaw scorned the \"well-made play\", he accepted the form, and even thrived by it, for it concentrated his skills on the conversation among characters, his greatest asset as a dramatist. Other classic twists on the well-made play can be seen in his use of the General's coat and the hidden photograph in \"Arms and the Man\".\n\nAlso, J. B. Priestley's 1946 \"An Inspector Calls\" may in some ways be considered a \"well-made play\" in that its action happens before the play starts, and in the case of the older Birlings no moral change takes place. The similarity between Priestley's play and this rather conservative genre might strike some readers/audiences as surprising because Priestley was a socialist. However, his play, like Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\" transcends this genre by providing another plunge into chaos after the return to normality. He replaced the dramatic full stop with a question mark by revealing in the last scene that the 'inspector' who has exposed the complicity of a prosperous industrial family in the murder or suicide of a working-class girl, is not an inspector at all (perhaps a practical joker, an emanation of the world to come, or a manifestation of the world to come), and the curtain falls on the news that a real girl has died and a real inspector is on the way.\n\nThe techniques of well-made plays also lend themselves to comedies of situation, often farce. In \"The Quintessence of Ibsenism\", Bernard Shaw proposed that Ibsen converted this formula for use in \"serious\" plays by substituting discussion for the plausible dénouement or conclusion. Thus, plays become open-ended, as if there were life for the protagonists beyond the last act curtain.\n\n\n"}

Studying and working with various electronic musicians and technicians at the city's Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, she oversaw the development of the Moog synthesizer, then a relatively new and unknown keyboard instrument designed by Robert Moog.\n\nCarlos came to prominence with \"Switched-On Bach\" (1968), an album of music by Johann Sebastian Bach performed on a Moog synthesizer which helped popularize its use in the 1970s and won her three Grammy Awards. Its commercial success led to several more keyboard albums from Carlos of varying genres including further synthesized classical music adaptations and experimental and ambient music. She composed the score to two Stanley Kubrick films, \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971) and \"The Shining\" (1980), and also \"Tron\" (1982) for Walt Disney Productions.\n\nIn 1979, Carlos was one of the first public figures to disclose having undergone gender reassignment surgery.\n\nCarlos was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, the first of two children born to working-class parents. Her mother played the piano and sang and had an uncle who played the trombone and another who played the trumpet and drums. She began piano lessons at six years of age, and wrote her first composition, \"A Trio for Clarinet, Accordion, and Piano\", at ten. Carlos attended St. Raphael Academy, a Catholic high school in Pawtucket. In 1953, at fourteen, Carlos won a scholarship for a home-built computer at the Westinghouse Science Fair, a research-based science competition for high-school students. From 1958 to 1962, Carlos studied at Brown University and graduated with a degree in music and physics, during which she taught lessons in electronic music at informal sessions.\n\nIn 1965, Carlos graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in music composition, during which she scored several films for students and a film maker for UNICEF, and assisted Leonard Bernstein to present an evening of electronic music at the Philharmonic Hall. Carlos studied with Vladimir Ussachevsky and Otto Luening, two pioneers of electronic music in the 1960s; the four were based in the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in New York City, the first of its kind in the United States. After Ussachevsky suggested to Carlos that she work in a recording studio to support herself, Carlos began working as a recording and mastering engineer at Gotham Recording Studios in New York City; she worked in this position until 1968. She called it \"a really lovely occupation\" and found it a useful learning experience.\n\nDuring her time at Columbia, Carlos met Robert Moog at the annual Audio Engineering Society show, which began a partnership; Carlos gave advice and technical assistance in the development of the Moog synthesizer, Moog's new electronic keyboard instrument, convincing Moog to add a touch-sensitive device for greater musical dynamics, among other improvements. By 1966, Carlos owned a small Moog synthesizer, which she used to record sound effects and jingles for television commercials, which earned her \"anywhere from $100 to $1000\". In 1967, Carlos befriended Rachel Elkind, a former singer who had a musical theatre background and worked as a secretary for Goddard Lieberson, then-president of Columbia Records. The two shared a home, studio, and business premises in a brownstone building in the West Side of Manhattan in New York City.\n\nCarlos wrote several compositions as a student. Two were recorded and released on \"By Request\" (1975), titled \"Dialogues for Piano and Two Loudspeakers\" (1963) and \"Episodes for Piano and Electronic Sound\" (1964). Others include \"Variations for Flute and Electronic Sounds\" (1964), \"Episodes for Piano and Tape\" (1964), \"Pomposities for Narrator and Tape\" (1965), and \"Noah\" (1965), an opera blending electronics with an orchestra. Her first commercial release was \"Moog 900 Series – Electronic Music Systems\", an introduction to the technical aspects of the Moog synthesizer released in 1967. Part of her compensation for making the recording was in Moog equipment.\n\nCarlos began her music career with \"Switched-On Bach\", an album formed of several pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach performed on a Moog modular synthesizer. The idea came about around 1967, when Carlos asked Elkind to listen to some compositions written by Carlos and musicologist Benjamin Folkman ten years prior at the Electronic Music Center, one of them being Bach's Two-Part Invention in F major, which Elkind took a liking to. Plans for an album of several Bach compositions developed from there, leading to a recording contract with Columbia Masterworks through Elkind's contacts, a deal that lasted until 1986. The label had launched an album sales campaign named \"Bach to Rock\", though it had no album of Bach's works in a contemporary context in its catalogue. With a $2,500 advance, Columbia granted Carlos and Elkind artistic freedom to produce and release the album. Carlos performs with additional synthesizers played by Folkman and Elkind as producer. Recording was a dragged out and time-consuming process as the instrument could only be played one note at a time.\n\nReleased in October 1968, \"Switched-On Bach\" became an unexpected commercial and critical success and helped to draw attention to the synthesizer as a genuine musical instrument. \"Newsweek\" dedicated a full page to Carlos with the caption \"Plugging into the Steinway of the future\". It peaked at No. 10 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart and was No. 1 on its Classical Albums chart from January 1969 to January 1972. It is the second classical album to sell over one million copies and was certified Gold in 1969 and Platinum in 1986 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Carlos performed selections from the album on stage with a synthesizer with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, the first of only two live performances since her days as a student (the other being with the Kurzweil Baroque Ensemble for 'Bach at the Beacon' in 1997). In 1970, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Classical Album, Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (With or Without Orchestra), and Best Engineered Classical Recording. Carlos released a follow-up, \"The Well-Tempered Synthesizer\", with synthesized pieces from multiple composers. Released in November 1969, the album reached No. 199 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and received two Grammy nominations. The success of both albums allowed Carlos to move into Elkind's more spacious New York City home in 1971.\n\nAfter the release of \"Switched-On Bach\", Carlos was invited to compose the soundtrack of two science fiction films, \"Marooned\" (1969), directed by John Sturges, and \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971) by Stanley Kubrick. When the directors of \"Marooned\" changed their minds about including a soundtrack, Carlos chose to work with Kubrick, as she and Elkind were fans of his previous films, adding: \"We finally wound up talking with someone who had a close connection to Stanley Kubrick's lawyer. We suddenly got an invitation to fly to London.\" Before Carlos knew about the offer, she read the book and began writing a piece based on it named \"Timesteps\". A soundtrack containing only the film cuts of the score was released as \"Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange\" in 1972, combining synthesized and classical music by Henry Purcell, Beethoven and Gioacchino Rossini with an early use of a vocoder. The album peaked the \"Billboard\" 200 chart at No. 146. Later that year, Carlos released an album of music not included in the final score titled \"Walter Carlos' Clockwork Orange\". Carlos later described the project as \"a lot of fun ... a pleasurable venture\".\n\nCarlos experimented with ambient music on her third studio album \"Sonic Seasonings\", released as a double album in 1972, with one long track dedicated to each of the four seasons. Recorded as early as 1970 and finished in mid-1971, before the \"A Clockwork Orange\" project was complete, Carlos wished to produce music that did not require \"lengthy concentrated listening\", but more than a collection of ambient noises to portray an environment. It combined field recordings of animals and nature with synthesized sounds, occasionally employing melodies, to create soundscapes. It reached No. 168 in the \"Billboard\" 200 and influenced other artists who went on to pursue the ambient and new-age genres in later years.\n\nBy 1973, Columbia/CBS Records had received a considerable number of requests for Carlos to produce another album of synthesized classical music. She agreed to the request, opting to produce a sequel to \"Switched-On Bach\", which began with her and Elkind seeking compositions that were most suitable for the synthesizer; the two picked selections from Suite No. 2 in B minor, Two-Part Inventions in A minor and major, Suite from Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach, and Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in D major. The latter features a Yamaha E-5 Electone organ for certain passages, as a reliable polyphonic keyboard had not been developed. The result, \"Switched-On Bach II\", was released in 1973 and sold over 70,000 copies in the US during the first five weeks of its release.\n\nFollowing \"Switched-On Bach II\", Carlos changed musical directions once more. In 1971, she and Elkind asked Columbia Records to attach a pre-paid business reply card in each new pressing of her albums, which resulted in a considerable amount of suggestions from the public regarding the subject of her future releases. The ideas received were divided; some asked for more classical adaptations, while others wanted more of Carlos' original compositions. Carlos decided, \"If I was going to spend months for mere minutes of music, I certainly wasn't going to be pigeonholed into only retreading existing music\", and so began a process of \"re-directing new ideas, reworking old ones\". By mid-1974, Carlos and Elkind had selected tracks of varying styles to record on the Moog synthesizer, which Carlos found liberating, as it demonstrated the flexibility of the instrument. Released as \"By Request\" in 1975, the album includes pieces from Bach, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, two of Carlos' compositions from the 1960s, and renditions of \"Eleanor Rigby\" by The Beatles and \"What's New Pussycat?\", originally sung by Tom Jones. The final track, a \"witty and serious\" set of variations based on themes by Edward Elgar, was replaced with tracks from \"The Well-Tempered Synthesizer\" on UK pressings after members of Elgar's estate refused to have his music presented in a less than serious light, which \"devastated\" Carlos. \"By Request\" was followed by \"Switched-On Brandenburgs\", a double album containing all six of Bach's \"Brandenburg Concertos\" played on a synthesizer, in 1979.\n\nCarlos reunited with Kubrick to compose the score for his psychological horror film \"The Shining\" (1980). Before filming began, Carlos and Elkind read the book, as per Kubrick's suggestion, for musical inspiration. Carlos recorded a considerable amount of music, but Kubrick ended up using existing music by several avant-garde composers he had used as guide tracks in the final version. \"The Shining (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\", released in 1980 on Warner Bros. Records, features two tracks credited to Carlos and Elkind: the main title theme and \"Rocky Mountains\", the former a reinterpretation of the \"Dies Irae\" section of \"Symphonie fantastique\" by Hector Berlioz. Some of Carlos' music had some legal issues regarding its release, but much of it was made available in 2005 as part of her two-volume compilation album \"Rediscovering Lost Scores\".\n\nWith work on \"The Shining\" complete, Elkind ended her long-time collaboration with Carlos when she moved to France with her husband in 1980. Carlos remained in New York City, sharing a converted loft in Greenwich Village with her new business partner Annemarie Franklin, which housed her new, remodelled studio, which was enclosed in a Faraday cage to shield the equipment from white noise and outside interference from radio and television signals.\n\nCarlos' first project with Franklin began around 1980, when The Walt Disney Company asked her to record the soundtrack to its science fiction feature \"Tron\" (1982). Carlos agreed, but was not interested in composing solely with electronic music, as she wished to incorporate an orchestra with her musical ideas. She recalled their demands were \"tightly specified ... there wasn't a lot of elbow room, and that made it fun\". The score incorporated Carlos' analog and digital synthesizers with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the UCLA Chorus, and the Royal Albert Hall Organ. \"Tron: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" was released in 1982 and reached No. 135 on the \"Billboard\" 200. Carlos intended to release her scores on her own album, but Columbia/CBS showed a lack of interest in the prospect.\n\nThree studio albums from Carlos were released in the 1980s. The first was \"Digital Moonscapes\" in 1984, Carlos' first to only feature digital synthesizers. She wrote the album's tracks for orchestra \"or orchestra replica\", inspired by various astronomical subjects, which used some leftover material from her score to \"Tron\". Soon after, Carlos secured a deal with Audion Records, a smaller label, as she wished to \"get away from that kind of big, monolithic government-like aspect that [she] had dealt with for so many years\". In 1986, Audion released \"Beauty in the Beast\", which saw Carlos experiment with just intonation, Balinese scales, and four new scales she devised for the album: Harmonic, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. The album features the first instance of a 35-note octave. Carlos considers the album as the most important of her career. She followed the album with \"Secrets of Synthesis\" in 1987, her final album for CBS/Columbia, featuring several introductions and demonstrations of synthesized music from Carlos with audio examples from her previous albums.\n\nIn 1988, CBS Records asked Carlos to collaborate with comical musician \"Weird Al\" Yankovic to release a parody of \"Peter and the Wolf\" by Sergei Prokofiev. Carlos agreed to the project, as she felt it presented a chance \"to let your sense of humor out of the cage\". Yankovic adapted and narrated its story, while Carlos rearranged the music with a \"MIDI orchestra\", her first venture using the digital interface. The album's second side also contains a humorous adaptation of \"The Carnival of the Animals\" by Camille Saint-Saëns titled \"The Carnival of the Animals–Part II\", with Yankovic providing funny poems for each of the featured animals in the style of poet Ogden Nash, who did similar for the original. Released in October 1988, \"Peter and the Wolf/Carnival of the Animals–Part II\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Album for Children in 1989.\n\nTo mark the 25th anniversary of \"Switched-On Bach\", Carlos re-recorded the album with her set of digital instruments and recording techniques. Released in 1992 on Telarc Records, \"Switched-On Bach 2000\" took roughly one and a half years to produce; Carlos estimated around 3,000 hours were invested in the project, which involved using several digital audio workstation software packages, including SoundTools and ProTools. A Moog synthesizer is only used once on the record; the rest is performed on 13 modern synthesizers. The album also marked her first venture into mixing in Dolby Surround sound.\n\nCarlos wrote the soundtrack to the British film \"Brand New World\" (1998), also known as \"Woundings\", directed by Roberta Hanley and based on a play by Jeff Noon. Carlos explained the style of her music: \"I was given fairly large carte blanche to do some horrific things and also some inside-psyche mood paintings, and that's what the film became\".\n\nIn 1998, Carlos released her most recent studio album, \"Tales from Heaven and Hell\", for the East Side Digital label.\n\nBeginning in 1998, Carlos digitally remastered her studio albums, culminating in the \"Switched-On Box Set\" released in 1999 featuring her four synthesized classical albums.\n\nIn 2005, the two-volume set \"Rediscovering Lost Scores\" was released, featuring previously out-of-print material, including the unreleased soundtrack to \"Woundings\" and music recorded for \"A Clockwork Orange\", \"The Shining\" and \"Tron\" that was not used in the films.\n\nCarlos became aware of her gender dysphoria at an early age, recalling: \"I was about five or six... I remember being convinced I was a little girl, much preferring long hair and girls' clothes, and not knowing why my parents didn't see it clearly\". While in college, she went on a date with a girl and felt \"so jealous of her I was beside myself\". When she moved to New York City in the 1960s, she learned about transgender issues for the first time and received counselling from sexologist Harry Benjamin. In early 1968, Carlos began hormone replacement treatments, which altered her appearance. Prior to a live performance of excerpts from \"Switched-On Bach\" with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, Carlos felt unhappy to appear in public. She cried in her hotel room and left wearing fake sideburns, a man's wig, and drew facial hair on her face with an eyebrow pencil to disguise herself as a man. Carlos did the same thing when she met Kubrick and for an appearance on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" in 1970. The commercial success of \"Switched-On Bach\" allowed Carlos to undergo sex reassignment surgery in May 1972, but she continued to release albums as \"Walter Carlos\" throughout the 1970s.\n\nCarlos kept her story secret until she agreed to a series of interviews with Arthur Bell between December 1978 and January 1979 for the May 1979 issue of \"Playboy\" magazine. She chose \"Playboy\", as it has \"always been concerned with liberation, and [I was] anxious to liberate myself\". In 1985, Carlos spoke about the reaction to her transition: \"The public turned out to be amazingly tolerant or, if you wish, indifferent ... There had never been any need of this charade to have taken place. It had proven a monstrous waste of years of my life.\"\n\nIn 1998, Carlos sued the songwriter/artist Momus for $22 million for his song \"Walter Carlos\" (from the album \"The Little Red Songbook\", released that year), which postulated that the post–sexual reassignment surgery Wendy could travel back in time to marry her pre-surgery self, Walter. The case was settled out of court, with Momus agreeing to remove the song from subsequent editions of the CD and owing $30,000 in legal fees.\n\n\"Switched-On Bach\" was the winner of three 1969 Grammy Awards:\n\nIn 2005, Carlos was the recipient of the SEAMUS Lifetime Achievement Award \"in recognition of lifetime achievement and contribution to the art and craft of electro-acoustic music\" by the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States.\n\nCarlos contributed a review of the then-available synthesizers to the June 1971 edition of the \"Whole Earth Catalog\", contrasting the Moog, Buchla and Tonus (aka ARP) systems. She was dismissive of smaller systems like the EMS Putney and the Minimoog as \"toys\" and \"cash-ins\".\n\nCarlos is also an accomplished solar eclipse photographer. Her work has been published online by NASA and has appeared on the cover of \"Sky & Telescope\". She has developed various techniques for the extension of dynamic range in eclipse photography by the use of digital composites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
