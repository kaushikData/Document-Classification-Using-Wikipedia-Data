The names given are typical, but usage varies; the same tale type number may be referred to by its central motif or by one of the variant folktales of that type, which can also vary, especially when used in different countries and cultures. The tale type does not have to be accurate for every folktale. For example, \"The Cat as Helper\" (545B) also includes tales where a fox helps the hero. Closely related folktales are often grouped within a type. For example, tale types 400–424 all feature brides or wives as the primary protagonist, for instance \"The Quest for a Lost Bride\" (400) or the \"Animal Bride\" (402). Subtypes within a tale type are designated by the addition of a letter to the AT number, for instance: the \"Persecuted Heroine\" (510) has subtypes 510A, \"Cinderella\", and 510B, \"Catskin\" .\n\nAntti Aarne was a student of Julius Krohn and his son Kaarle Krohn. Aarne developed their historic-geographic method of comparative folkloristics, and developed the initial version of what became the Aarne–Thompson tale type index for classifying folktales, first published in 1910.\n\nThe American folklorist Stith Thompson translated Aarne's motif-based classification system in 1928, enlarging its scope. With Thompson's second revisions to Aarne's catalogue in 1961, he created the \"AT number system\" (also referred to as \"AaTh system\"), which is often used today, more commonly in its updated \"ATU number\" form. According to D. L. Ashliman, \"The Aarne–Thompson system catalogues some 2500 basic plots from which, for countless generations, European and Near Eastern storytellers have built their tales\".\n\nThe AT-number system was updated and expanded in 2004 with the publication of \"The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography\" by Hans-Jörg Uther. Uther noted that many of the earlier descriptions were cursory and often imprecise, that many \"irregular types\" are in fact old and widespread, and that \"emphasis on oral tradition\" often obscured \"older, written versions of the tale types\". To remedy these shortcomings Uther developed the Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification (ATU) system and included more tales from eastern and southern Europe as well as \"smaller narrative forms\" in this expanded listing.\n\nThe Aarne–Thompson \"Motif-Index of Folk-Literature\" organizes thousands of motifs into a similar system. Entries are first organized by an umbrella topic (for example, category S is \"Unnatural Cruelty\"). Entries are then divided into more specific subcategories. For example, entry S50 \"Cruel relatives-in-law\", under which is the more specific entry S51.1 \"Cruel mother-in-law plans death of daughter-in-law\".\n\nIn his essay \"The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique\", Alan Dundes explains that the Aarne–Thompson indexes are some of the \"most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis\".\n\nThe tale type index was criticized by Vladimir Propp of the Formalist school of the 1920s for ignoring the of the motifs by which they are classified. Furthermore, Propp contended that using a \"macro-level\" analysis means that the stories that share motifs might not be classified together, while stories with wide divergences may be grouped under one tale type because the index must select some features as salient. He also observed that while the distinction between animal tales and tales of the fantastic was basically correct—no one would classify Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf an animal tale because of the wolf—it did raise questions because animal tales often contained fantastic elements, and tales of the fantastic often contained animals; indeed a tale could shift categories if a peasant deceived a bear rather than a devil.\n\nIn describing the motivation for his work, Uther presents several criticisms of the original index. He points out that Thompson's focus on oral tradition sometimes neglects older versions of stories, even when written records exist, that the distribution of stories is uneven (with Eastern and Southern European as well as many other regions' folktale types being under-represented), and that some included folktale types have dubious importance. Similarly, Thompson had noted that the tale type index might well be called \"The Types of the Folk-Tales of Europe, West Asia, and the Lands Settled by these Peoples\". However, Alan Dundes notes that in spite of the flaws of tale type indexes (e. g., typos, redundancies, censorship, etc.; p. 198), \"they represent the keystones for the comparative method in folkloristics, a method which despite postmodern naysayers ... continues to be the hallmark of international folkloristics\" (p. 200).\n\nA quantitative study, published by folklorist Sara Graça da Silva and anthropologist Jamshid J. Tehrani in 2016, tried to evaluate the time of emergence for the \"Tales of Magic\" (ATU 300–ATU 749), based on a phylogenetic model. They found four of them to belong to the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) stratum of magic tales, namely:\n\n\nTen more magic tales were found to be current throughout the Western branch of the Indo-European languages, comprising the main European language families derived from PIE (i. e. Balto-Slavic, Germanic and Italo-Celtic):\n\n\n\n"}

Aristotle, in \"The Poetics\", saw the role of the actor somewhat differently, suggesting that by witnessing \"pity and fear\" (in his view the essence of tragedy) on stage, an audience could experience a catharsis of the emotions associated with real tragic events, without having to experience them as first-hand participants.\n\nSince then, the 'stand-off' between those who have seen art as having a direct impact on morality, and those who have asserted its independence, has persisted. Tolstoy was ambivalent about the role of the artist (despite being one himself). In \"What is Art?\" he castigated now-canonical artists such as Shakespeare, Goethe and Wagner for failing to express the 'simple truths' about morality (as he saw them), opting instead to show off their poetic cleverness. He saw their work as morally reprehensible, effectively a wasting of their talents through their failure to communicate moral truth to the masses.\n\nSince the late nineteenth century and beyond, with the development of 'the Arts' as a cultural concept, the debate about art and morality has intensified, with the ever more challenging activities of artists becoming targets for those who see art as an influence for bad or good, and it has been a mainstay of many art critics' negative reviews. John Ruskin accused Whistler of \"flinging a pot of paint in the face of the audience\", and several of the ballets of Diaghilev scandalised audiences with their explicit (at the time) sexual themes.\n\nWhistler and Ruskin eventually went face-to-face in the courtroom. But in 1961, one of the most famous legal clashes between art and morality occurred when Penguin Books were taken to court over their publication of D. H. Lawrence's novel \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\". Similarly, in 1977 the Christian morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse successfully sued a magazine, \"Gay News\", under blasphemous libel laws. \n\nIn popular culture, pornography (if seen in aesthetic terms) is used as an example of the objectification of women, and violent films have been cited as the influence for so-called \"copycat\" acts in reality. An example of this was the Hungerford Massacre, where a gunman was alleged by the tabloid press to have been influenced by the \"Rambo\" series of films starring Sylvester Stallone.\n\nIn September 2001, shortly after the World Trade Center Attack, the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen said of the atrocity that it was \"Lucifer's greatest work of art.\" (However, Stockhausen's comments were taken out of context and misunderstood.) The responses were immediate and extreme, fuelled once again by the tabloid press. Some have found, here and elsewhere, art in the service of morality to be politically dangerous.\n\nIn purely philosophical terms, the precise nature of art's links with morality have been long been questioned. Some have found no link between the aesthetic and the moral (i.e. being morally reprehensible does not deny an artwork its art status; it does not cease having aesthetic value no matter how depraved some might see it being), whereas others, who have not gone down the explicitly Platonist route, have argued that the relationship is one akin to supervenience. Here, it is argued that an essential component of the production of art, the human factor, can only be made sensible if taken along with the perceived moral codes which govern humanity.\n"}

{"id": "3574096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3574096", "title": "Community arts", "text": "Community arts\n\nCommunity arts, also sometimes known as \"dialogical art\", \"community-engaged\" or \"community-based art,\" refers to artistic activity based in a community setting. Works from this genre can be of any media and is characterized by interaction or dialogue with the community. Often professional artists collaborate with people who may not otherwise normally actively engage in the arts. The term was defined in the late-1960s and spawned a movement which grew in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Australia. In Scandinavia, the term \"community art\" means more often contemporary art project.\n\nOften community art is based in economically deprived areas, with a community-oriented, grassroots approach. Members of a local community will come together to express concerns or issues through an artistic process, sometimes this may involve professional artists or actors. These communal artistic processes act as a catalyst to trigger events or changes within a community or even at a national or international level.\n\nIn English-speaking countries, community art is often seen as the work of community arts centre. Visual arts (fine art, video, new media art), music, and theater are common mediums in community art centers. Many arts companies in the UK do some community-based work, which typically involves developing participation by non-professional members of local communities.\n\nThe term \"community art\" refers also to the field of community, neighbourhood and public art practice with roots in social justice and popular and informal education methods. In the art world, community art signifies a particular art making practice, emphasizing community involvement and collaboration. Community art is most often art for social change and involves some empowerment of the community members who come together to create artwork/s with artists. This is a growing national, international, regional and local field. Recently community arts and sustainability work or environmental action have begun to interface, including urban revitalization projects creating artwork at a neighbourhood level.\n\nModels of community-engaged arts can vary with three forms of collaborative practices emerging from among the sets of common practices. In the artist-driven model, artists are seen as the catalysts for social change through the social commentary addressed in their works. A muralist whose work elicits and sustains political dialogue would be a practitioner of this model. In the second model, artists engage with community groups to facilitate specialized forms of art creation, often with the goal of presenting the work in a public forum to promote awareness and to further discourse within a larger community. In the process-driven or dialogic model, artists may engage with a group in order to facilitate an artistic process that addresses particular concerns specific to the group. The use of an artistic process (such as dance or social circus) for problem-solving, therapeutic, group-empowerment or strategic planning purposes may result in artistic works that are not intended for public presentation. In the second and third models, the individuals who collaborate on the artistic creation may not define themselves as artists but are considered practitioners of an art-making process that produces social change.\n\nDue to its roots in social justice and collaborative, community-based nature, art for social change may be considered a form of cultural democracy. Often, the processes (or the works produced by these processes) intend to create or promote spaces for participatory public dialogue.\n\nIn Canada, the field of community-engaged arts has recently seen broader use of art for social change practices by non-arts change organizations. The resultant partnerships have enabled these collaborative communities to address systemic issues in health, education, as well as empowerment for indigenous, immigrant, LGBT and youth communities. A similar social innovation trend has appeared where business development associations have engaged with artists/artistic organizations to co-produce cultural festivals or events that address social concerns.\n\nAs the field diversifies and practices are adopted by various organizations from multiple disciplines, ethics and safety have become a concern to practitioners. As a result, opportunities for cross-disciplinary training in art for social change practices have grown within the related field of arts education.\n\nA community can be seen in many ways, it can refer to different kind of groups. There are also virtual communities or online communities. Internet art has many different forms, but often there is some kind of community that is created for a project or it is an effect of an art project.\n\nCommunity theatre includes theatre made by, with, and for a community—it may refer to theatre that is made almost by a community with no outside help, or to a collaboration between community members and professional theatre artists, or to performance made entirely by professionals that is addressed to a particular community. Community theatres range in size from small groups led by single individuals that perform in borrowed spaces to large permanent companies with well-equipped facilities of their own. Many community theatres are successful, non-profit businesses with a large active membership and, often, a full-time professional staff. Community theatre is often devised and may draw on popular theatrical forms, such as carnival, circus, and parades, as well as performance modes from commercial theatre. Community theatre is understood to contribute to the social capital of a community, insofar as it develops the skills, community spirit, and artistic sensibilities of those who participate, whether as producers or audience-members.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2284563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2284563", "title": "Conditioned taste aversion", "text": "Conditioned taste aversion\n\nConditioned taste aversion occurs when an animal associates the taste of a certain food with symptoms caused by a toxic, spoiled, or poisonous substance. Generally, taste aversion is developed after ingestion of food that causes nausea, sickness, or vomiting. The ability to develop a taste aversion is considered an adaptive trait or survival mechanism that trains the body to avoid poisonous substances (e.g., poisonous berries) before they can cause harm. The association reduces the probability of consuming the same substance (or something that tastes similar) in the future, thus avoiding further poisoning. It is an example of classical or \"Pavlovian\" conditioning.\n\nStudies on conditioned taste aversion which involved irradiating rats were conducted in the 1950s by Dr. John Garcia, leading to it sometimes being called the Garcia effect.\n\nConditioned taste aversion sometimes occurs when sickness was merely coincidental and not related to the substance that caused the sickness. For example, a person who becomes very sick after consuming vodka-and-orange-juice cocktails may then become averse to the taste of orange juice, even though the sickness was caused by the over-consumption of alcohol. Under these circumstances, conditioned taste aversion is sometimes known as the \"Sauce-Bearnaise Syndrome\", a term coined by Seligman and Hager.\n\nWhile studying the effects of radiation on various behaviors in the mid to late 1950s, Dr. John Garcia noticed that rats developed an aversion to substances consumed prior to being irradiated. To examine this, Garcia put together a study in which three groups of rats were given sweetened water followed by either no radiation, mild radiation, or strong radiation. When rats were subsequently given a choice between sweetened water and regular tap water, rats who had been exposed to radiation drank much less sweetened water than those who had not. Specifically, the total consumption of sweetened water for the no-radiation, mild radiation and strong radiation rats was 80%, 40% and 10%, respectively.\n\nThis finding ran contrary to much of the learning literature of the time in that the aversion could occur after just a single trial and over a long delay. Garcia proposed that the sweetened water became regarded negatively because of the nausea inducing effects of the radiation, and so began the study of conditioned taste aversion.\n\nMany scientists were skeptical of Garcia's findings because it did not follow the basic principles of classical conditioning. However, Garcia replicated his results multiple times. He demonstrated that the particular stimulus used in classical conditioning does matter. An internal stimulus produced an internal response while an external stimulus produced an external response; but an external stimulus would not produce an internal response and vice versa.\n\nTaste aversion does not require cognitive awareness to develop—that is, the subject does not have to consciously recognize a connection between the perceived cause (the taste) and effect (the negative feeling). In fact, the subject may \"hope\" to enjoy the substance, but the body handles it reflexively. Conditioned taste aversion illustrates the argument that in classical conditioning, a response is elicited.\n\nAlso, taste aversion generally only requires one trial. The experiments of Ivan Pavlov required several pairings of the neutral stimulus (e.g., a ringing bell) with the unconditioned stimulus (i.e., meat powder) before the neutral stimulus elicited a response. With taste aversion, after one association between sickness and a certain food, the food may thereafter elicit the response. In addition, lab experiments generally require very brief (less than a second) intervals between a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus. With taste aversion, however, the hotdog a person eats at lunch may be associated with the vomiting that person has in the evening.\n\nIf the flavor has been encountered before the subject becomes ill, the effect will not be as strong or will not be present. This quality is called latent inhibition. Conditioned taste aversion is often used in laboratories to study gustation and learning in rats.\n\nAversions can also be developed to odors as well as to tastes.\n\nCommon vampire bats (\"Desmodus rotundus\") do not learn taste aversions despite being closely related to other species of bats that do. The diet of common vampire bats only consists of vertebrate blood and therefore it is hypothesized that the development of a taste aversion to their only food source would not be advantageous for these animals.\n\nTaste aversion is fairly common in humans. When humans eat bad food (e.g., spoiled meat) and get sick, they may find that food aversive until extinction occurs, if ever. Also, as in nature, a food does not have to \"cause\" the sickness for it to become aversive. A human who eats sushi for the first time and who happens to come down with an unrelated stomach virus may still develop a taste aversion to sushi. Even something as obvious as riding a roller coaster (causing nausea) after eating the sushi will influence the development of taste aversion to sushi. Humans might also develop aversions to certain types of alcohol because of vomiting during intoxication.\n\nTaste aversion is a common problem with chemotherapy patients, who become nauseated because of the drug therapy but associate the nausea with consumption of food.\n\nTaste aversion has been demonstrated in a wide variety of both captive and free-ranging predators. In these studies, animals that consume a bait laced with an undetectable dose of an aversion agent avoid both baits and live prey with the same taste and scent as the baits. When predators detect the aversion agent in the baits, they quickly form aversions to the baits, but discriminate between these and different-tasting live prey.\n\nStimulus generalization is another learning phenomenon that can be illustrated by conditioned taste aversion. This phenomenon demonstrates that we tend to develop aversions even to types of food that resemble the foods which cause us illness. For example, if one eats an orange and gets sick, one might also avoid eating tangerines and clementines because they look similar to oranges, and might lead one to think that they are also dangerous.\n\nStimulus generalization operates in most facets of animal and human life far beyond food tastes and aversion. Trauma and negative reinforcement of all kinds create aversion of other negative reaction to generalizations from the adverse event or events. And like taste aversion, the generalization may or not be conscious. Stimulus generalization is a factor in most \"superstitious behavior\", racism and prejudice of all kinds.\n\nAlthough the terms \"taste avoidance\" and \"taste aversion\" are often used interchangeably, studies with rats indicate they are not necessarily synonymous. \"Aversion\" is defined as \"a strong dislike or disinclination\" and \"avoidance\" is defined as \"stopping oneself from doing\". The difference is that in avoidance, the organism is controlling its behavioural responses. Taste avoidance and taste aversion can at times go hand in hand, but they cannot be looked at or be defined the same way.\n\nStudies on rats to determine how they react to different tasting liquids and injections indicate this difference. Scientists measured the facial and somatic reactions of rats after exposure to a flavored solution (sucrose or salt) which do not induce abnormal feelings. However, immediately after the rat ingests the solution, the rat is injected with a drug that induces nausea. The rat subsequently expresses a disgust reaction towards the solution, seen by mouth gaping. This is a Pavlovian conditioned response as the rat is associating the disgust with the solution that it drank immediately before the injection. The rat experiences taste \"aversion\". This is similar to when a human, for example, eats a steak that is perfectly safe and edible and coincidentally contracts a stomach bug and starts vomiting within a few hours of eating the steak. Although the human may know that the vomiting was due to a virus and not from eating the steak, the conditioned response in the brain associates the steak with vomiting due to the timing and the human may avoid steak because he has developed a learned taste aversion to the steak.\n\nWhen examining taste avoidance, however, the rat may avoid a food yet still enjoy it and choose it over others. In further tests, the rats were tested with another sucrose solution but this time it was paired with a drug that gave positive, euphoric effects, such as amphetamine, cocaine, and morphine. The rats showed positive reactions to the drugs. However, rats react to any change in physiological state as a sign of danger and avoided approaching these solutions. When one of these euphoric solutions was placed next to another solution that had a learned taste aversion, the rat would choose the substance that it had a taste avoidance towards. Scientists theorize that in terms of evolution, because rats are unable to vomit and immediately purge toxins, rats have developed a strong \"first line of defense\", which is their sense of taste and smell. This further shows the importance of taste and the correlation between taste and any change in physiological state, whether it be good or bad. Because rats rely upon taste and pairing it with a reaction rather than relying on later responses that involve the gastrointestinal tract, taste avoidance is just as prevalent as taste aversion, though the two don't necessarily go hand in hand.\n\n"}

Upon graduation, she was employed by the city's highways department, where she became a radio dispatcher.\n\nRehm married John Rehm, her second husband, in 1959; he was working at the State Department, she was working as a secretary. John Rehm died June 23, 2014 after he stopped eating and drinking to end his suffering from Parkinson's disease. After his death, Rehm became a staunch advocate for medical aid in dying, arguing that no one should suffer needlessly in the way that her husband did.\nShe has two adult children, David and Jennifer.On October 14, 2017 Diane Rehm and John Hagedorn were married at the Washington National Cathedral. \n\nRehm has spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological condition that affects the quality of her voice.\n\nRehm began her radio career in 1973 as a volunteer for WAMU's \"The Home Show.\" In 1979, she took over as the host of WAMU's morning talk show, \"Kaleidoscope\", which was renamed \"The Diane Rehm Show\" in 1984.\n\nRehm has interviewed many political and cultural figures, including John McCain, Barack Obama, Madeleine Albright. She has said that her most touching interview was with Fred Rogers of the PBS program \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\", conducted just before his death. Rehm has described her interviews with Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton to have been \"amazing experiences.\"\n\nShe has written three autobiographical books. The first, \"Finding My Voice\", dealt with her traditional upbringing in a Christian Arab household, her brief first marriage and divorce, her 50-year marriage to John Rehm, raising her children, the first 20 years of her radio career, and her battles with depression, osteoporosis, and spasmodic dysphonia. Together with John Rehm she co-wrote \"Toward Commitment: A Dialogue about Marriage\", which was published in 2002.\n\nHer memoir, \"On My Own\", was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 2016.\n\nThe final broadcast of \"The Diane Rehm Show\" was aired on December 23, 2016.\n\nIn 2005, a private study funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting reported that Rehm booked 22 liberal guests for every 5 conservative guests. The study was criticized as a politicized attempt to, in Rehm's word, \"scare\" journalists with the accusation of liberal bias. One criticism of the study concerned its criteria of what constituted \"liberal\" – a category which included seemingly moderate Republicans such as Senator Chuck Hagel and former Representative Bob Barr. The study was commissioned by Kenneth Tomlinson, whose appointment to the chairmanship of the CPB by George W. Bush had been criticized by liberals as politically motivated. Tomlinson hired Indiana consultant Frederick W. Mann, a conservative thinker previously associated with the Young America's Foundation, which has described itself as \"the principal outreach organization of the Conservative Movement\".\n\nA report on the study by the CPB's Inspector General, Kenneth Konz, criticized Tomlinson's methods; the report led to Tomlinson's immediate resignation in November 2005. According to the \"Washington Post\", Rehm personally \"called Mann's findings 'unprofessional and simplistic.' [and] added 'I've been booking shows for 25 years. I don't think they have any idea what it takes to achieve the professionalism and expertise and the right people to express a variety of points of view. . . . What [Kenneth Tomlinson]'s doing, I think, is trying to scare public broadcasters.' \"\n\nRehm has been featured in three political movie documentaries: \"Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains\", \"I.O.U.S.A.\", and Dinesh D'Souza's \"\" which used her quote, \"And then you've got the cover of \"Forbes\" magazine, a cover story by Dinesh D'Souza. I think nothing has turned my stomach so much in recent years as reading that piece.\"\n\nOn June 10, 2015, Rehm interviewed 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, and stated that Sanders had dual citizenship with Israel; this was not true. Sanders denied that he holds dual citizenship, but Rehm repeated her assertion of the senator's dual citizenship as a fact. Rehm's statements were criticized by David Harsanyi in \"The Federalist\" for being an anti-Semitic smear. Sophia Tesfaye of \"Salon\" pointed out that Rehm apparently fell for an antisemitic canard and did not successfully fact-check her information before she conducted her interview with Sanders. In \"The Times of Israel\", Gedalyah Reback stated that the interview was controversial because Rehm seemed to have accused a Jewish U.S. presidential candidate of maintaining secret Israeli citizenship.\n\nRehm apologized for her exchange with Sanders in a statement released later that day. \"On today's show I made a mistake. Rather than asking if Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders whether he had dual U.S./Israeli citizenship, as I had read in a comment on Facebook, I stated it as fact. I want to apologize as well to all our listeners for having made an erroneous statement. I am sorry for the mistake. However, I am glad to play a role in putting this rumor to rest.\" Journalist Josh Marshall called her apology \"a total crock.\" Law professor David Bernstein found it strange that both Rehm and her producer fell for what he felt was an obvious anti-Semitic hoax. He speculated that frequently-heard strange accusations about Jewish supporters of Israel may have played a role. Elizabeth Jepsen, NPR's ombudsman, took issue with both Rehm's interview and apology: \"Far from putting anything to rest, Rehm has now taken a falsehood from the fringes of the Internet and moved it into the mainstream conversation.\"\n\nFollowing the 2014 death of her husband—who was unable to get physician assisted suicide drugs due to their illegality in Maryland—Rehm became an advocate for right to die. NPR's ombudsman deemed that her related fundraising for Compassion & Choices violated the NPR ethical standards, and she agreed to stop attending fundraising dinners.\n\nA partial list of Rehm's honors and awards:\n\n"}

In most substances which are not dichromatic, only the brightness and saturation of the colour depend on their concentration and layer thickness.\nExamples of dichromatic substances are pumpkin seed oil, bromophenol blue, and resazurin.\nWhen the layer of pumpkin seed oil is less than 0.7 mm thick, the oil appears bright green, and in layer thicker than this, it appears bright red.\n\nThe phenomenon is related to both the physical chemistry properties of the substance and the physiological response of the human visual system to colour. This combined physicochemical–physiological basis was first explained in 2007.\n\nDichromatic properties can be explained by the Beer-Lambert law and by the excitation characteristics of the three types of cone photoreceptors in the human retina. Dichromatism is potentially observable in any substance that has an absorption spectrum with one wide but shallow local minimum and one narrow but deep local minimum. The apparent width of the deep minimum may also be limited by the end of the visible range of human eye; in this case, the true full width may not necessarily be narrow. As the thickness of the substance increases, the perceived hue changes from that defined by the position of the wide-but-shallow minimum (in thin layers) to the hue of the deep-but-narrow minimum (in thick layers).\n\nThe absorbance spectrum of pumpkin seed oil has the wide-but-shallow minimum in the green region of the spectrum and deep local minimum in the red region. In thin layers, the absorption at any specific green wavelength is not as low as it is for the red minimum, but a broader band of greenish wavelengths are transmitted, and hence the overall appearance is green. The effect is enhanced by the greater sensitivity to green of the photoreceptors in the human eye, and the narrowing of the red transmittance band by the long-wavelength limit of cone photoreceptor sensitivity.\nAccording to the Beer-Lambert law, when viewing through the coloured substance (and thus ignoring reflection), the proportion of light transmitted at a given wavelength, \"T\", decreases exponentially with thickness \"t\", T = e, where \"a\" is the absorbance at that wavelength. Let \"G\" = e be the green transmittance and \"R\" = e be the red transmittance. The ratio of the two transmitted intensities is then (\"G\"/\"R\") = e. If the red absorbance is less than the green, then as the thickness \"t\" increases, so does the ratio of red to green transmitted light, which causes the apparent hue of the colour to switch from green to red.\n\nThe extent of dichromatism of material can be quantified by the Kreft's dichromaticity index (DI). It is defined as the difference in hue angle (Δh) between the colour of the sample at the dilution, where the chroma (colour saturation) is maximal and the colour of four times more diluted (or thinner) and four times more concentrated (or thicker) sample. The two hue angle differences are called dichromaticity index towards lighter (Kreft's DI) and\ndichromaticity index towards darker (Kreft's DI) respectively. Kreft's dichromaticity index DI and DI for pumpkin oil, which is one of the most dichromatic substances, are −9 and −44, respectively. This means that pumpkin oil changes its colour from green-yellow to orange-red (for 44 degrees in Lab colour space) when the thickness of the observed layer is increased from cca 0.5 mm to 2 mm; and it changes slightly towards green (for 9 degrees) if its thickness is reduced for 4-fold.\n\nA record by William Herschel (1738–1822), shows he observed dichromatism with a solution of ferrous sulphate and tincture of nutgall in 1801 when working on an early solar telescope, but he did not recognise the effect.\n"}
{"id": "42615540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42615540", "title": "Dutch Interiors", "text": "Dutch Interiors\n\nThe Dutch interiors are a series of three paintings painted by Joan Miró in 1928, each inspired by Dutch Golden Age paintings of Dutch interiors. \"Dutch Interior I\" is a reinterpretation of the \"Lute Player\" by Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh, \"Dutch Interior II\" is a reinterpretation of \"Children Teaching a Cat to Dance\" by Jan Steen, and \"Dutch Interior III\" is a reinterpretation of the \"Young woman at her toilet\", also by Steen. They belong to a Mirós' period called \"assassination of painting\".\nIn the Spring of 1928, during a trip to Belgium and Holland, Miró was impressed by the Dutch masters of the 17th-century. After buying colorful postcards of some paintings he began his \"reinterpretations\". The colors are the hues of the original paintings, but the intensity of the color is purely Miró. Thus, a green-gray gradient wall of Martensz Sorgh becomes a green apple in Miró.\n\nThis painting presents a scene where the lute player stands in the centre. A woman besides him looks at the partiture, near a table. Under the table, a cat and a dog are playing. These domestic components contrast with the landscape of Amsterdam which is seen through a window.\n\nIt includes the same degree of detail shown in \"The Farm\", with nowaday objects as the basket of the house. The huge size of the main elements, as the lute, corresponds to its importance in the scene and not to its real size or the proportions of the original picture. This ability to break the model by distorting the images (mainly sizes and shapes of the objects) is a key characteristic of Miró's style. It doesn't go never very far away from the Flemish model. As Miró reported \"I had the postcard pinned up on my easel while I painted\"\n\nThe colours belong to the same hue as in the original painting but with a greater intensity. They are pure and flat colours, not mixed ones, with special attention to green, white and brown.\n\nIn this painting there are some repeated elements, like the dog and the cat, who dance with a group of children. The subject is not a description or a realistic work, but the music and the sound. Two red eyes are watching the scene and they foresse the fantasy touch of the third one, so the three paintings can be seen as a progressive series. Blue and brown are the main colours of the interior, while the cat serves as the spinning force of the whole composition.\n\nIt shows the aim of Miró to perform what it was called antipainting, influenced by Dada and Marcel Duchamp. When he takes a famous painting and transforms it, he is recognizing his debt with the model while he destroys it. At the same time Miró is questioning his own previous work.\n\nThe third painting of the series differs from the other two because, despite of being inspired by a domestic scene of a Flemish model, it changes the subject: the main character is a woman who isn't taking a bath but giving birth to a goat. This woman is impaled by a nail to the floor and is framed by a black line, one of the typical colours of Miró. The cruelty of the scene is softened by the stylization of the details, although the red of the blood makes it harder, attracting the attention of the viewer.\n\n"}

The documents can then be used to \"prove\" that the fictional events happened. A common propaganda tool, false documentation is often used by management groups and totalitarian governments for four basic reasons:\n\nPerhaps the best illustration of false documentation is Nazi Germany, where the authorities falsified documents for all four reasons.\n\nThere are three basic methods for falsifying documentation. One way, of course, is to create an entirely fictional event and write it down. The other is to misrepresent an actual incident by embellishment or exaggeration so that the blame for the incident is misplaced. The third is to refuse to document an actual event, thereby exonerating the instigators for lack of proof.\n\nThe practice of false documentation rests on the fallacy, promoted by management organizations and governments, that whatever has been written down is unquestionably true. In business, it rests on a further bias: the tendency of management to believe managers rather than to collect and objectively judge evidence. As folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand points out, when a story or a claim appears in print, it gains an air of authority. Many people are skeptical of spoken rumors, but few doubt the veracity of stories appearing in the news media.\n\nA related fallacy is, of course, that whatever has \"not\" been documented must not have happened. Although absence of evidence is evidence of absence, whether any given event happened is entirely independent of whether it was documented.\n\nIn George Orwell's novel \"1984\", the Ministry of Truth has an entire department devoted to altering past editions of newspapers in the belief that changing documentation will change the public's perception of history. One of the novel's greatest ironies is that the Ministry of Truth deals exclusively in lies.\n\n"}
{"id": "1739903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1739903", "title": "Final girl", "text": "Final girl\n\nThe final girl is a trope in horror films (particularly slasher films). It refers to the last girl or woman alive to confront the killer, ostensibly the one left to tell the story. The final girl has been observed in many films, including \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\", \"Halloween\", \"Alien\", \"Friday the 13th\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", and \"Scream\". The term was coined by Carol J. Clover in her book \"Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film\" (1992). Clover suggested that in these films, the viewer began by sharing the perspective of the killer, but experienced a shift in identification to the final girl partway through the film. \n\nThe original meaning of \"final girl\", as described by Clover in 1992, is quite narrow. Clover studied slasher films from the 1970s and 1980s (which is considered the golden era of the genre) and defined the final girl as a female who is the sole survivor of the group of people (usually youths) who are chased by a villain, and who gets a final confrontation with the villain (whether she kills him herself or she is saved at the last minute by someone else - i.e. a police officer), and who has such a 'privilege' because of her implied moral superiority (i.e. she is the only one who refuses sex, drugs and other such behaviors, unlike her other friends). \n\nHowever, the term \"final girl\" is often used, especially in recent years, in a much broader sense, applied also outside the slasher genre, and to females who are not morally pure, or even who survive together with other survivors, provided the other survivors are not the main focus of the struggle. The stereotypical virginal girl contrasted with her girlfriends' promiscuity is largely out of use today. Furthermore, slasher films have declined in popularity in recent decades, being replaced with science fiction horror in the 1990s, and supernatural horror in the 21st century. In fact, it has been argued that the most common female character trope of the 21st century horror is the Dysfunctional Mother female character.\n\nA common plot line in many horror films is one in which a series of victims is killed one-by-one by a killer amid increasing terror, culminating in a climax in which the last surviving member of the group, usually female, either vanquishes the killer or escapes. \n\nThe final girl trope has evolved throughout the years, from early final girls most often being damsels in distress, often saved by a strong male (such as a police officer or a heroic stranger), to more modern final girls who are more likely to survive due to their own abilities. Lila Crane, from \"Psycho\", is an example of a female survivor (according to Clover's definition not a final girl due to lack of moral purity) who is saved by a male (also named Sam Loomis) at the film's ending, and Laurie Strode from \"Halloween\" is a final girl saved by someone else. \n\nOn this basis, Tony Williams argues that, whilst 1980s horror film heroines were more progressive than those of earlier decades, the gender change is done conservatively, and the final-girl convention cannot be regarded as a progressive one \"without more thorough investigation\". Furthermore, in many slashers, the final girl's victory is often ambiguous or only apparent. The fact that she is still alive at the end of the movie does not make her a victorious heroine. In many of these movies, the end is ambiguous, where the killer/entity is or might be still alive, leaving the viewers uncertain about the future of the final girl (a notable example is Jess Bradford in \"Black Christmas\" (1974). Tony Williams also gives several examples of final girls in the heroines of the \"Friday the 13th\" series such as Chris Higgins from \"Part III\". He notes that she does not conclude the film wholly victorious. Chris is catatonic at the end of the film. Williams also observes that \"\" does not have a final girl, despite Trish Jarvis surviving at the end. Williams also notes that final girls often survive, but in the sequel they are either killed or institutionalized. A notable example is Alice Hardy who survives \"Friday the 13th\" (1980) only to be killed in the beginning of \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" (1981). Derek Soles argues that the tragic destiny of such final girls represents an expression of patriarchal society where capable, independent women must by be contained or destroyed. In more recent films, this has started to change, with the final girl no longer being always doomed, a notable example being the \"Scream\" series.\n\nAccording to Clover, the final girl in many movies shares common characteristics: she is typically sexually unavailable or virginal, and avoids the vices of the victims like illegal drug use. She sometimes has a unisex name such as Avery, Chris, or Sidney. Occasionally the final girl will have a shared history with the killer. The final girl is the \"investigating consciousness\" of the film, moving the narrative forward and, as such, she exhibits intelligence, curiosity, and vigilance. Another trope of slashers (particularly in the 1980s) is \"death by sex\", where sex scenes are shortly followed by violence, with the participants being murdered in gruesome ways. More recent horror movies challenge more of these tropes. Buffy Summers in \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", in the words of Jes Battis, \"subverts\" the final girl trope of B-grade horror films. Jason Middleton observes that although Buffy fulfills the monster-killing role of the final girl, she is the opposite of Clover's description of a final girl in many ways. Buffy is a cheerleader, a \"beautiful blond\" with a feminine first name, and \"gets to have sex with boys and \"still\" kill the monster\". Sidney Prescott in \"Scream\" also survives despite having sex.\n\nOne of the basic premises of Clover's theory is that audience identification is unstable and fluid across gender lines, particularly in the case of the slasher film. During the final girl's confrontation with the killer, Clover argues, she becomes masculinized through \"phallic appropriation\" by taking up a weapon, such as a knife or chainsaw, against the killer. The phenomenon of the male audience having to identify with a young female character in an ostensibly male-oriented genre, usually associated with sadistic voyeurism, raises interesting questions about the nature of slasher films and their relationship with feminism. Clover argues that for a film to be successful, it is necessary for this surviving character to be female because she must experience abject terror, and many viewers would reject a film that showed abject terror on the part of a male. The terror has a purpose, in that the female, if she survives, is 'purged' of undesirable characteristics, such as relentless pursuit of personal pleasure. Certain films, like \"The Witch\" (2015), can be said to subvert traditional expectations of a final girl.\n\nWhile the 1972 version of the character has been viewed as more of a victim, the 2009 incarnation of the character has been observed to follow the \"final girl\" archetype. In \"Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study\", Alexandra Heller-Nicholas notes that that 2009 version of the character manifests traits of the trope, stating:\n\nAn early example of a \"final girl\" can be found in the film \"Black Christmas\" (1974), where Jess Bradford, played by Olivia Hussey, is a well-developed character who refuses to back down against a series of more or less lethal male antagonists. Jess is technically not a final girl according to the narrow definition, due to lack of chastity, but being a sole survivor of an early major influential slasher she is often analyzed together with final girls.\n\nSally Hardesty from \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1974), created by Tobe Hooper and portrayed by Marilyn Burns, has been regarded as one of the earliest examples of the final girl trope.\n\nAccording to Clover, Laurie Strode (from \"Halloween\", \"Halloween II\", \", , and Halloween 2018)\" is another example of a final girl. Tony Williams notes that Clover's image of supposedly progressive final girls are never entirely victorious at the culmination of a film nor do they manage to eschew the male order of things as Clover argues. He holds up Strode as an example of this. She is rescued by a male character, Dr. Samuel Loomis, in the ending of \"Halloween\".\n\nBefore the release of \"Alien 3\", Clover identified Ellen Ripley from the \"Alien\" franchise as a final girl. Elizabeth Ezra continues this analysis for \"Alien Resurrection\", arguing that by definition both Ripley and Annalee Call must be final girls, and that Call is the \"next generation of Clover's Final Girl\". In Ezra's view, Call exhibits traits that fit Clover's definition of a final girl, namely that she is boyish, having a short masculine-style haircut, and that she is characterized by (in Clover's words) \"smartness, gravity, competence in mechanical and other practical matters, and sexual reluctance\" being a ship's mechanic who rejects the sexual advances made by male characters on the ship. However, Ezra notes that Call fits the description imperfectly as she is a gynoid, not a human being.\n\nChristine Cornea disputes the idea that Ripley \"is\" a final girl, contrasting Clover's analysis of the character with that of Barbara Creed, who presents Ripley as \"the reassuring face of womanhood\". Cornea does not accept either Clover's or Creed's views on Ripley. While she accepts Clover's general thesis of the final girl convention, she argues that Ripley does not follow the conventions of the slasher film, as \"Alien\" follows the different conventions of the science fiction film genre. In particular, there is not the foregrounding in \"Alien\", as there is in the slasher film genre, of the character's sexual purity and abstinence relative to the other characters (who would be, in accordance with the final girl convention, killed by the film's monster \"because\" of this). The science fiction genre that \"Alien\" inhabits, according to Cornea, simply lacks this kind of sexual theme in the first place, as it has no place in such \"traditional\" science fiction formats.\n\nThe character Ginny Field (from \"Friday the 13th Part 2\") has often been viewed as an example of the trope. In \"The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film\", Barry Keith Grant stated that, \"Ginny temporarily adopts Mrs. Voorhees's authoritarian role to survive. Although circumstances necessitate this, she clearly uses her enemy's strategy to become a phallic mother herself. This posture really questions the positive image of the Final Girl.\" He then called her \"not victorious\" when she called out for her boyfriend at the end of the film saying that it was done in a \"non-independent manner\". John Kenneth Muir references Ginny in \"Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1\", saying \"Amy Steel is introduced as Ginny, our final girl and heroine, and the only person who seems to have an inkling of the nearby danger. She's more resourceful than Alice and nearly upstages even Laurie Strode during the film's tense finale, wherein she brazenly dresses up as Jason's dead mother and starts barking orders at the confused serial killer.\" In \"Blood Money: A History of the First Teen Slasher Film Cycle\", Richard Nowell said \"The shift in characterization of the female leads was also trumpeted during Ginny's self-confident entrance (Amy Steel) in \"Friday the 13th Part II\". Where the makers of its predecessor introduced Alice as she prepared cabins while dressed in denim jeans and a shapeless lumberjack shirt, the sequel's conventionally attractive lead is established immediately as combining masculine traits with feminine attributes. Ginny exits a battered VW bug in a flowing fuchsia skirt and a low-cut t-shirt.\" Ginny's adoption of the monster's own strategy, in \"Part II\", brings into question whether the final girl image is in fact a wholly positive one.\n\nSarah Connor was a timid young woman for the most part in the first film, \"The Terminator\". She learned of the Terminator from Kyle Reese, and that he had come for her. By the end of the film, when it was down to her versus the Terminator, she had become a tough-as-nails heroine, and defeated the Terminator by luring it into a hydraulic press, where she crushed it. By the second film, she had become a hardened warrior, in danger of losing her humanity.\n\nThe character Nancy Thompson (from \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"\"), has often been regarded as one of the most influential horror movie heroines. In his book \"Horror films of the 1980s\", John Kenneth Muir references Nancy Thompson, stating the following:\n\nKearney points to the character of Sidney Prescott in the \"Scream\" franchise. One of the final girl stereotypes was that the final girl is supposed to be a virgin, but the \"Scream\" films challenged that by allowing Prescott to survive until the end – even after having sex.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Thus free music is either in the public domain or licensed under a free license by the artist or copyright holder themselves, often as a method of promotion. It does \"not\" mean that there should be no fee involved. The word free refers to freedom (as in free software), not to price.\n\nThe Free Music Philosophy generally encourages creators to free music using whatever language or methods they wish. A Free Music Public License (FMPL) is available for those who prefer a formal approach.\nSome free music is licensed under licenses that are intended for software (like the GPL) or other writings (the GFDL). But there are also licenses especially for music and other works of art, such as EFF's Open Audio License, LinuxTag's Open Music License, the Free Art license and some of the Creative Commons Licences.\n\nBefore the advent of copyright law in the early 18th century and its subsequent application to music compositions first, all music was \"free\" according to the definitions used in free software or free music, since there were no copyright restrictions. In practice however, music reproduction was generally restricted to live performances and the legalities of playing other people's music was unclear in most jurisdictions. Copyright laws changed this gradually so much so that in the late 20th century, copying a few words of a musical composition or a few seconds of a sound recording, the two forms of music copyright, could be considered criminal infringement.\n\nIn response, the concept of free music was codified in the Free Music Philosophy by Ram Samudrala in early 1994. It was based on the idea of \"Free Software\" by Richard Stallman and coincided with nascent open art and open information movements. Up to this point, few modern musicians distributed their recordings and compositions in an unrestricted manner, and there was no concrete rationale as to why they did it, or should do it. \n\nThe Free Music Philosophy used a three pronged approach to voluntarily encourage the spread of unrestricted copying, based on the fact that copies of recordings and compositions could be made and distributed with complete accuracy and ease via the Internet. First, since music by its very nature is organic in its growth, the ethical basis of limiting its distribution using copyright laws was questioned. That is, an existential responsibility was fomented upon music creators who were drawing upon the creations of countless others in an unrestricted manner to create their own. Second, it was observed that the basis of copyright law, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts\", had been perverted by the music industry to maximise profit over creativity resulting in a huge burden on society (the control of copying) simply to ensure its profits. Third, as copying became rampant, it was argued that musicians would have no choice but to move to a different economic model that exploited the spread of information to make a living, instead of trying to control it with limited government enforced monopolies.\n\nThe Free Music Philosophy was reported on by diverse media outlets including \"Billboard\", \"Forbes\", \"Levi's Original Music Magazine\", \"The Free Radical\", \"Wired\" and \"The New York Times\". Along with free software and Linux (a free operating system), copyleft licenses, the explosion of the Web and rise of P2P, the cementing of mp3 as a compression standard for recordings, and despite the efforts of the music industry, free music became largely the reality in the early 21st century. Organisations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Creative Commons with free information champions like Lawrence Lessig were devising numerous licenses that offered different flavours of copyright and copyleft. The question was no longer why and how music should be free, but rather how creativity would flourish while musicians developed models to generate revenue in the Internet era.\n\n\n\n"}

The building was designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, chosen for the commission by the school's director, Francis Newbery, who oversaw a period of expansion and fast-growing reputation. The first half of the building was completed in 1899 and the second half in 1909.\n\nThe School's campus has grown since that time and in 2009 an international architectural competition was held to find an architect-led design team who would develop the Campus Masterplan and design the Phase 1 building. The competition was won by New York-based Steven Holl Architects working with Glasgow-based JM Architects. The Reid Building was completed in 2014 and sits opposite the now destroyed Mackintosh Building on a site previously occupied by the Foulis, Assembly and Newbery Tower Buildings.\n\nThe school has produced most of Scotland's leading contemporary artists including, since 2005, 30 per cent of Turner Prize nominees and four recent Turner Prize winners: Simon Starling in 2005, Richard Wright in 2009, Martin Boyce in 2011 and Duncan Campbell in 2014. The School of Architecture is highly rated by the architecture profession and the School of Design has been described by Design Week as \"leaders in design education\".\n\nThe School is organised into five academic schools, the Mackintosh School of Architecture (named after Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who is also the GSA's most revered alumnus), the School of Design, the School of Fine Art, the School of Simulation and Visualisation (formerly the Digital Design Studio), specialising in digital and virtual technologies was launched in October 2016. The Innovation School was launched in September 2017. GSA also has a long-established portfolio of non-degree art and design classes for children and adults delivered through GSA Open Studio.\n\nDisciplines include fine-art photography (founded by Thomas Joshua Cooper in 1982); painting and printmaking, sculpture and environmental art, product design, product-design engineering, textile design, fashion design, silversmithing and jewellery design, interior design, communication design, interaction design, and architecture.\n\nThe original Mackintosh building was severely damaged by fire on 23 May 2014. An initial fire service estimate was that 90 per cent of the building and 70 per cent of its contents had been saved. The fire, which began in the basement, quickly spread upwards and, although it was brought under control quite quickly, significant damage was done to the historic studios and stairways. The renowned Mackintosh library was destroyed; the archive was water damaged, but was able to be air and freeze dried. There were no reported casualties.\n\nThe fire broke out as students were preparing for their Degree Show. Eyewitnesses said that the fire appeared to have started when a projector exploded in the basement of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building just before 12:30 pm. Investigators later determined that the cause was not a faulty projector, but \"a canister of expanding foam\" used in close proximity to a hot projector, causing flammable gases to ignite. According to \"The Scotsman\" newspaper, the use of aerosol cans is against school policy. The report from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service found that the design of the building contributed greatly to the spread of the fire: \"the number of timber lined walls and voids, and original ventilation ducts running both vertically and horizontally throughout the building\" as well as \"a vertical service void\", which \"ran the entire height of the building … [and] allowed flames, hot gases, and smoke to travel\". Fire and smoke dampers, which are intended to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through ducts, had not been retrofitted. In addition, an intended \"fire suppression system\" for the building had not been completed. A school staff member was on hand when the blaze first ignited, but was unable to contain the fast-spreading flames.\n\nA careful restoration process began soon after the fire; work on restoring and recreating the Mackintosh design, including the famous library interior, started in 2016. The restoration was performed with historical accuracy, including the use of original wood species such as longleaf pine and tulipwood.\n\nA large fire broke out in the Mackintosh Building on 15 June 2018, causing extensive damage. Emergency services received the first call at 11:19 pm BST, and 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were dispatched to the fire. No casualties were reported. Alan Dunlop, visiting professor of architecture at Robert Gordon University who studied at the Mackintosh School of Architecture, was contacted by the press immediately after the fire and stated: \"I can’t see any restoration possible for the building itself. It looks totally destroyed.\" This point of view was not supported by the early external building surveys, which appeared to indicate that much of the exterior had survived, though extensively damaged. Drone footage enabled a clearer assessment of the extent of the interior damage, and a programme of partial dismantling was established to stabilise the portions of the facade at risk of collapse, notably the south elevation. A Glasgow City Council spokesperson said: \"There is a consensus emerging that the intention of the building control people, HES (Historic Environment Scotland) people and the art school is to save the building... Right now, people are operating on the understanding it will be saveable.\" It was also noted by Roger Billcliffe that “It has been voted Britain’s most important building several times over, and we have all of the information needed to recreate every detail, following extensive laser surveys after the first fire.\" \n\nThe first opportunity for the school administration to visit the site happened on 19 June 2018. Muriel Gray, Chair of the Board of Governors, stated: \"This was the first opportunity for the expert team to see the building and begin what will be a long and complex process of determining the future of the Mack, but we remain optimistic. There is a huge desire to see Mackintosh’s masterpiece rise again, one which we all share. We have incredibly detailed information on the building collated over the last 4 years, and have worked with teams of talented craftspeople who were doing a tremendous job on the restoration.\" In a subsequent statement to the BBC, Professor Tom Inns, director of the school, affirmed that \"This building is not beyond saving. It will be saved in some form.\" He continued to support his firm belief that the building should continue in its function as a working art school, rather than a museum.\n\nAt the time of the fire, sprinklers had yet to be installed in the building. Components for the fire suppression system had been delivered the day before, but were weeks away from assembly and testing. Building control officers have expressed concerns that the end walls may collapse. The building remains cordoned off and affected residents have been offered accommodation by Glasgow City Council.\n\nOn 28 June 2018 it was announced that work is being planned to take down parts of the building that are in danger of collapse. Compensation for local residents and businesses will be made available by the Scottish Government.\n\nOn 29 June 2018, Glasgow School of Art terminated its £25 million restoration contract with Kier following the Mackintosh Building fire.\n\nThe school currently has two separate campuses: the School of Fine Art, Digital Culture, and MFA programmes are in the vicinity of the Mackintosh building. The School of Design – Textiles, Jewellery & Silversmithing, Product Design Engineering, Product Design, Communication Design and Interior Design – the Centre for Advanced Textiles, Design Innovation Studio and the Where the Monkey Sleeps cafe have recently moved back to the Garnethill Campus with the occupation of the new Reid Building.\n\nThe Institute of Design Innovation (InDI), a research centre of the School of Design is based in Forres and the school has a Representative Office in Beijing, PRC. The GSA has a specialist research and postgraduate centre, Digital Design Studio (DDS), based on the southside of Glasgow in a new facility at Pacific Quay by the River Clyde in a building called The Hub.\n\nThe Mackintosh Building was the heart of the campus and continued to be a functioning part of the school until the first major fire on 23 May 2014. The building housed the Fine Art Painting department, first year studios and administrative staff. It houses the Mackintosh gallery which held many different exhibitions throughout the year. The Mackintosh Gallery (also known as the Mackintosh Museum) was the only part of the Mackintosh building open to the general public; all other areas of the school were only viewable by guided tour. An exception to this rule was the Degree Show where all the studios within the Mackintosh building were opened to allow people to view the graduating year's final artworks. Since the fire of May 2014 the School of Fine Art has been temporarily housed in a campus at the Tontine Building, Merchant City, Glasgow while the Mackintosh Building underwent restoration and the newly acquired Stow Building is refurbished.\n\nThe Richmond Building houses the Fine Art Photography department. The Mackintosh School of Architecture and the school's library and learning resources are situated in The Bourdon Building. The Barnes Building on West Graham Street is the base for the Sculpture and Environmental Art, International Foundation and Interaction Design programmes.\n\nAn international architectural competition was launched in March 2009 to find the design team to prepare a campus masterplan and detailed design of the first new building phase. The winner of the competition was Steven Holl Architects, working in partnership with Glasgow’s JM Architects and Arup Engineering. Work commenced in 2011 and continued until 2013. The building was structurally complete in 2013.\nThe new building has been named the Reid Building after the last Director: Dame Seona Reid, and won Building of the Year at the 2014 Architect's Journal awards – the AJ100 Awards in May 2014, and the Award for Arts or Entertainment Structures at the IStructE's 2014 Structural Awards.\n\nSince September 2012, the GSA has delivered years 3 and 4 of its Bachelor of Arts (Hons) Programmes in Communication Design and Interior Design in Singapore, in partnership with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), based at the Temasek Polytechnic Campus in Tampines.\nThe programmes enable Diploma students from the Singapore Polytechnics to progress from a Diploma to a BA (Hons) degree. \nStudents studying in Singapore benefit from the same programme of study and award as in the home institution, along with resources and equipment according to the GSA specifications.\n\nThe GSA has been ranked in the top 10 of specialist educational institutions in \"The Guardian\" University Guide, ranking it the top specialist visual arts institution in the UK. Its degrees are validated by the University of Glasgow. Of its 1,900 students, almost 20 per cent are international, 20 per cent from the rest of the UK and approximately 20 per cent are postgraduate. The GSA is placed 10th in the 2015 QS World Rankings for Art and Design and 2nd in the nationally ranking 2016 Complete University Guide league table for Art and Design. HESA statistics show the GSA to have one of the lowest student drop-out rates in the UK.\n\nIn 2002 the funding councils published figures which placed Glasgow School of Art as having the second-lowest number of students from a working-class background out of a list of UK higher education institutions. With 7 per cent of its students coming from social classes IIIm, IV and V (skilled manual, semi-skilled or un-skilled workers), the figures put it above Oxford and Cambridge in terms of exclusivity. Glasgow School of art disputed the figures, explaining that the majority of its applicants did not come through the UCAS system on which the statistics were based so the numbers involved were very small. This was reinforced by HEFCE, which said the figures should be treated with care.\n\nIn March 2016, the Commission on Widening Access (CoWA) found the percentage of Scottish-domiciled full-time first degree entrants from SIMD 20 (20 per cent most deprived areas of Scotland) at the GSA was 22.2 per cent. This is the second highest in Scotland, according to CoWA's report, with only University of the West of Scotland having more.\n\nThe Glasgow School of Art is host to a number of high-profile research projects, funded primarily through the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and the Economic and Social Research Council, although other UK research councils have funded projects in the past.\n\nAt the last Research Assessment Exercise in 2014, the GSA had the largest art and design research community in Scotland and with 23 per cent of research evaluated as world leading. The GSA has a number of research centres including the Digital Design Studio, Mackintosh Environmental Architectural Research Unit, Institute of Design Innovation, Centre for Advanced Textiles and the Glasgow Urban Lab\n\nResearch professors include Professor Thomas Joshua Cooper, Professor Alastair Macdonald, Professor Tim Sharpe, Professor Irene McAra-McWilliam , Professor Ken Neil, Professor Johnny Rodger, Professor Christopher Platt, Professor Steve Love, Professor Paul Chapman and Professor Brian Evans.\n\nThe school runs an annual public programme of exhibitions and events. The Reid Gallery has a curated programme that works with contemporary artists, designers and architects; and GSA staff and students, and makes connections to the heritage and architecture of the Glasgow School of Art and its collections.\n\n\n\n"}

Its chronology is still a matter for debate, but it could span from the fourth up to the first millennium BC, overlapping, at its start, with Levantine Art and surviving marginally in some isolated regions during much later stages.\n\nIts main characteristic, and that which gives it its name, is the schematic, that is, a figurative style in which only the basic fragments of each figure are represented (eliminating all the rest); what's more, the representation is so basic that the graphic elements are converted into mere outlines, but without losing the minimal identifying features. In fact, the schematic phenomenon is considered somewhat more precise and problematic, and it is integrated in a wide movement which affects almost all of Europe and the Mediterranean.\n\nIt could be said that the schematic phenomenon has global dimensions, although each region, including the Hispanic, has its own, differentiating aspects.\n\nSchematics in art is a concept linked to realism (a figurative representation more or less faithful to nature, with concrete details which allow the easy identification of the figures), stylization (also figurative, but which accentuates certain details considered arbitrarily important, repeating and distorting them until they lose their real shapes), and abstraction (representations completely unconnected with reality which are associated with a philosophical symbolism and which, although they may unconsciously contain some real elements, such a link is not possible to prove).\n\nEven if one only takes the peninsular ambit into account, schematic art lacks uniformity, it spans quite a wide chronology and its geography is too wide, which makes its study difficult and makes it almost impossible to establish cultural phases or regions.\n\n"}

It starred \"All That\" cast members Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell. 62 episodes and a made-for-TV movie were produced over four seasons from 1996 to 2000. The first two seasons were filmed at Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida, and the remaining two were filmed at the Nick on Sunset theater in Hollywood.\n\n\"Kenan & Kel\" received critical acclaim, with praise of the performance of the title characters. It won the \"Favorite TV Show\" award at the 1998 Kids Choice Awards, and Thompson and Mitchell were ranked No. 40 and No. 39, respectively, on VH1's 100 Greatest Kid Stars. Reruns of the show are currently shown on TeenNick, as part of their programming block \"NickSplat,\" as well as MTV2, a sister channel of TeenNick under Viacom.\n\nThe show was set in Chicago, Illinois, and centered on the antics of two mischievous teenagers, Kenan Rockmore (Kenan Thompson) and Kel Kimble (Kel Mitchell). Kenan is a high school student with a job at a local grocery store, while Kel is his clumsy, orange soda-loving best friend.\n\nEpisodes of the series always open and closed with Kenan and Kel breaking the fourth wall by interacting with the studio audience, standing in front of a red curtain that is placed in front of the main set while they are still in character. A frequent running gag of the openings is Kel never knowing what the night's episode would be about and Kenan refusing to tell him. The closings would frequently feature Kenan coming up with a new scheme, often asking Kel to get various assorted items and meet him somewhere. Frazzled, Kel would exclaim his catchphrase, \"Aww, here it goes!\"\n\nAnother catchphrase commonly heard throughout the series is \"WHYYYYYYY!?!?\", usually screamed by Kenan after Kel does something stupid.\n\nThe theme song, entitled \"Aw, Here It Goes\", is performed by rapper Coolio. He is featured in the opening credits of the show along with Kenan and Kel. The lyrics describe the show and reference other famous duos such as Siegfried & Roy, Abbott & Costello, Penn & Teller, and former Los Angeles Lakers teammates Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, as well as Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys.\n\nThe series was created by Kim Bass (who also co-created the teen sitcom \"Sister, Sister\"). It was reminiscent of the classic comedic duo stylings of Laurel and Hardy, Martin and Lewis or Abbott and Costello (who were actually mentioned in the theme song), with Kenan being the straight man and Kel his comedic foil.\n\nThe show was taped in front of a live-studio audience and ran from August 17, 1996 to July 15, 2000, totaling 62 episodes. One full-length TV movie was created, entitled \"Two Heads Are Better Than None\", which aired on July 15, 2000, thus ending the series serving as its finale. The Kenan & Kel characters also made a special guest appearance on the \"Cousin Skeeter\" two-part episode, \"Hoo, I'm Wild Wild West\".\n\nReruns of the series briefly aired on \"Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids\" in 1999. After the series finished its run, reruns continued to air on Nickelodeon from January 21, 2001 to February 15, 2004.\n\nThe series reran on The N (later known as TeenNick) from October 13, 2007, to August 2, 2009. It then returned to the channel from July 25, 2011, to February 3, 2013, and again from March 4, 2013, to May 31, 2014, as part of its \"The '90s Are All That\" programming block (later called The Splat and now called NickSplat), which continues to air sporadic reruns.\n\nThe only DVD releases of Kenan and Kel that are currently available are the Best of Seasons 1 & 2 DVD and Best of Season 3 & 4 DVD. They are DVD-R Releases manufactured on demand though Amazon.com. Individual seasons are not available. The Best of Seasons 1 & 2 DVD is missing 3 Episodes (\"In the Line of Kenan\", \"Baggin' Saggin Kel\", and \"\"Safe and Sorry\"; all from season 1) to complete the set, but Season 2 is complete.

{"id": "15806523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15806523", "title": "Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum", "text": "Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum\n\nThe Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum is a permanent exhibition of 27 carved Pictish stones in the centre of the village of Meigle in eastern Scotland. It lies on the A94 road running from Coupar Angus to Forfar. The museum occupies the former parish school, built 1844. The collection of stones implies that an important church was located nearby, or perhaps a monastery. There is an early historical record of the work of Thana, son of Dudabrach, who was at Meigle (recorded as \"Migdele\") in the middle of the 9th century during the reign of King Pherath. Thana was likely to have been a monk serving as a scribe in a local monastery that could have been founded in the 8th century. The stones contained in the museum were all found near Meigle, mostly in the neighbouring churchyard or used in the construction of the old church. The present church building dates to about 1870, the previous building having been destroyed in a fire on 28 March 1869. The stones are Christian monuments to the dead of the Pictish warrior aristocracy, who are depicted on the stones bearing their weapons or hunting.\n\nThe museum building was originally the village schoolhouse. The building was purchased by the local laird Sir George Kinloch towards the end of the 19th century in order to protect the symbol stones. In 1936 the museum passed into the ownership of the State, it was renovated after the Second World War and reopened to the public in 1949.\n\nAbout one third of the stones in the museum are Class II in nature (stones with symbols carved in relief and usually bearing a Christian cross). Most of the stones date to the 9th or 10th century AD and were intended as tombstones. The stones are carved from the local sandstone, which is suitable for fine sculpture. Some stylistic elements of the stones show the influence of Northumbria. The Pictish stones at Meigle have a distinct local style that includes an emphasis on aggressive biting beasts, the decorating of crosses with a diagonal key pattern and the usage of rounded heads on cross-slabs.\n\nThe sandstone used to sculpt the monuments is old red sandstone, a relatively soft stone that lends itself to detailed carving but is susceptible to erosion. The monuments are likely to have been worked with iron tools such as chisels, punches and hammers, together with hammerstones and wooden mallets. The sculpted designs may have been copied from painted vellum pattern books.\n\nAccording to the local records, eight stones were lost before the close of the 19th century, including Meigle 10. Some of the surviving stones are parts of larger monuments and it is probable that other fragments are buried in Meigle churchyard or have been used in the construction of walls. Before being moved into the museum, Meigle 1 and Meigle 2 stood on either side of the northern entrance to the churchyard, in front of a grass-covered mound called Vanora's Grave. Some of the stones appear to have been trimmed and placed near the Grave in the 16th and 17th centuries in order to decorate it.\n\nMeigle 1 is a cross-slab. The stone was originally used as a standing stone two millennia before it was sculpted by the Picts, it has cup and ring marks low down on the back of the stone. The cross is Greek in style, with full circles at each of the four andles between the shaft and the arms. The inside of the cross is decorated with interlace patterns, the cross-point being decorated with spirals. The cross shaft itself is flanked by images of mythical beasts. It has an uncoordinated jumble of symbols arranged around a hunting scene on the other side. Among these are images of a winged figure that perhaps represents a Persian deity and of a kneeling camel, as well as a Pictish Beast, salmon, a serpent and Z-rod, a mirror, a comb, a dog's head, animals and horsemen. This stone originally stood on the west side of the northern entrance to the churchyard, opposite Meigle 2. Meigle 1 may be the oldest stone at Meigle, possibly carved in the late 8th century.\n\nMeigle 2 stands nearly high. It has a cross on one side and depicts Daniel in the lions' den on the other. The form of the head of the cross is possibly based on that of a jewelled metal cross and is unique. The projecting boss at the centre of the cross has eight smaller bosses around it that probably symbolise the eight days of Passion Week running from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday inclusive. The shaft of the cross contains three pairs of sculpted animals facing each other, with interlaced tails and tongues, while other beasts fill the space between the cross and the outer border of the monument. The monument is the work of a master sculptor with the figures being cut in deep relief and arranged in an orderly fashion. Meigle 2 has projecting tenons on its top and sides and was probably intended to slot into a screen or wall. Local folklore holds that the representation of Daniel in the lions' den depicts King Arthur's wife Guinevere, known locally as Vanora. She was abducted by King Mordred and condemned by Arthur to be torn apart by wild beasts. The monument was said to mark her grave. Meigle 2 was originally located on the east side of the northern entrance to the churchyard, opposite Meigle 1, and in front of a mound identified in local folklore as Vanora's Grave. Apart from the scene representing Daniel, the back of the monument also contains various other sections. These include a mounted huntsman with two hounds at the top, with an angel hovering above the dogs. Below this there is a procession of four horsemen, with three leading the fourth, who is distinguished by a large saddlecloth. The next row down is the Biblical Daniel scene, below this is a centaur holding an axe in each hand and branches trailing behind him. The lowest section depicts a beast grasping an ox, a club-wielding human figure is positioned behind the aggressor. The stone has lost some detail due to erosion, although this is concentrated at the lower part of the cross itself and suggests that some form of human activity regularly caused abrasion of that portion - the opposite side being less worn.\nMeigle 3 dates to the 9th century AD. One side has a cross, with a part of a Pictish double-disc symbol to the left, below the arm. On the other is inscribed a mounted warrior wearing a sword below his cape, the scabbard tipped with a chape. The warrior is seated on a striped saddle cloth and carries a spear in his right hand. Meigle 3 is a low gravestone and the warrior may be a portrait of the deceased person. The stone was cut shorter at least twice in antiquity, its original height may have been .\n\nMeigle 4 is a fragmented cross-slab with the central portion missing, the surviving fragments are masterpieces of sculpture. Animals are carved on either side of the top of the cross, with their heads curving up to bite two animals forming the frame of the design. There is an animal below the left arm of the cross with elaborate entwined tail and horns. Opposite this, below the right arm of the cross, is the upper portion of a person struggling against an animal. The inside of the cross is filled with interlace patterns. The reverse of the monument has tightly packed figures and symbols. A mounted horseman occupies the top of the stone, with two interlaced serpents behind. Under the horse's hooves is another entwined serpent, a Pictish Beast and another animal, with another horseman behind. A crescent with V rod symbol occupies the lowest portion of the stone.\n\nMeigle 5 has a cross carved in high relief on one side. The base of this Greek-style cross sports the unusual decoration of two animal heads. Each quarter of the background contains a single beast. Meigle 5 is a small monument and was carved as an upright headstone for a grave. The back of the stone depicts a lone horseman with a decorated saddle-cloth. On one edge of the monument are inscribed two symbols; the so-called Pictish Beast and a mirror.\n\nMeigle 6 is the central fragment of a cross-slab. The surviving shaft of the cross is decorated with a diagonal key pattern. The back of the stone has,from top to bottom, a horse and rider, a double disc symbol, a crescent and a dog wearing a collar.\nMeigle 7 is the top portion of a rounded cross-slab. The cross is decorated with a diagonal key pattern. The back of the monument has a double disc and Z-rod and a comb.\n\nMeigle 8 is a small fragment measuring across. It has an eroded cross on one side and the upper portion of two animals on the reverse, facing each other with forelegs in the opposing beast's mouth. A symbol above them may represent a tool.\n\nMeigle 9 is a recumbent tombstone. It has a shallow slot in the top and sculpted panels on both long sides. One of the panels depicts a griffin, an interlace pattern, an elongated animal wrapped into a knot and two animals facing each other. The other panel is composed of an animal, a sitting person with his limbs entwined with the legs of a bird, another animal, some spiral patterns and a final section that is badly eroded.\n\nMeigle 10 is now lost. It was a carved rectangular panel depicting a horse pulling a carriage bearing a driver and two passengers, the monument also showed a crouching archer and several beasts. The sculpture probably formed a part of a low church screen, possibly separating the chancel and the nave. The stone had been moved inside the old church for protection and was destroyed in the fire of 1869.\nMeigle 11 is another recumbent monument and is the largest of the recumbent stones from Meigle. The long sides of the stone have deeply recessed panels with wide borders that once were decorated but are badly worn. The top of the monument is undecorated and has a wide slot at one end. One side of the stone has the sculpted images of three mounted riders accompanied by a dog, behind them is a humanoid figure with an animal's head and gripping two entwined serpents. The other side of the monument is decorated with two intertwined animals followed by a dog and a bear, one above the other, and an unidentified object. To the right of these is a panel of twelve bosses encircled by serpents. At the extreme right is a wheel of seven bosses set within a frame formed of two upright animals with entwined tails and gripping the extremities of a human figure in their mouths.\nMeigle 12 is one of the last monuments from Meigle. It is a recumbent gravestone sculpted with a lozenge pattern along the upper surface and with a fish monster and an animal on one side. The other side has a dog biting the leg of a deer and two bulls charging each other. Both ends of the monument are damaged.\n\nMeigle 13 was a piece of a broken cross-slab, now lost.\n\nMeigle 14 is a fragment of a cross-slab. Another fragment of the same monument was built into the old church and was destroyed in the fire. The surviving fragment of cross is filled with interlace and a diagonal key pattern. The reverse side shows a robed cleric carrying a book and a part of a second similar figure, the lost section had the rest of this second figure and a third figure almost identical to the first, facing in the opposite direction.\n\nMeigle 15 is a fragment from the shaft of a small cross-slab. The shaft of the cross is filled with an interlace pattern, on the left are two fighting beasts, on the right side is another animal biting its own back.\n\nMeigle 16 through to Meigle 19 were all fragments of cross-slabs and are now lost.\n\nMeigle 20 is a fragment from the centre of a cross-slab. The shaft is filled with interlace and the fragment also has the carved image of a rider.\n\nMeigle 21 is a portion of a cross slab. It was tall and narrow, the head of the cross being filled with a diagonal key pattern while the circle of the head was formed by sculpted ropework. The shaft of the cross is decorated with an interwoven pattern.\nMeigle 22 is a piece of an architectural frieze bearing a sculpture of what has been identified as either the Pictish form of the Celtic god Cernunnos or else a siren, cross-legged with the entwined legs terminating in fish-tails. The figure is flanked by two animals with prominent claws.\n\nMeigle 23 is a small tombstone with a ringed cross on one side between two seated figures and with two pairs of animals decorating the back. The upper pair of animals have their heads apparently joined together, the lower pair are entwined and each bites the other's tail.\n\nMeigle 24 is one of the lost monuments. It was a small cross-slab.\n\nMeigle 25 is a hogback tombstone dating to the late 10th century. The sides of the monument are decorated with carved rooftiles and the ridge of the recumbent stone is sculpted with a fishtailed beast. The stone tapers at one end, and the sides of the monument together with this tapering end are sculpted with concave-sided roof-tiles. The stone demonstrates stylistic affinities with early hogback stones from the Glasgow area. The ridge of the stone is carved with an elongated beast with its head at the higher end of the monument, the beast has the tail of a fish at the tapering end if the stone. The creature's head is similar to the heads of animals on Meigle 1 and Meigle 5.\nMeigle 26 is an exceptionally fine recumbent gravestone. It has a socket at one end to hold a vertical cross or stone. The top of the stone has three coiled snakes wrapped around each other at one end, with a design consisting of twelve bosses in the middle and two sea-horses facing each other at the lower end. The left and right borders are marked with interlace patterns that end in birds' heads at one end, at the other end animal jaws open to frame a hollow slot. The sides of the monument are also decorated; one has a hunting scene and a griffin. The opposite side has depictions of a corpse being consumed by two beasts, four interlaced naked human figures and a further two beasts. The end of the stone is carved with a manticore and a human figure.\n\nMeigle 27 is a piece from a cross slab and depicts a figure sitting in a chair, with his servant sat on the floor behind him.\n\nMeigle 28 is the bottom piece of a broken cross slab, it has a horizontal base panel filled with a spiral pattern, and two vertical panels filled with a diagonal key pattern.\n\nMeigle 29 is a fragment depicting two clerics, one of whom appears to be sitting on a chair. The more complete of the two figures has two shoulder brooches holding the folds of his clothing.\n\nMeigle 30 is a fragment carved with a coiled beast.\n\nMeigle 31 is the upper portion of a cross slab, with interlace pattern flanking the head of the cross.\n\nMeigle 32 is a fragment from a cross slab, containing the left arm of the cross and part of a panel containing spiral patterns.\n\nMeigle 33 is a fragment of sculpture with a circular pattern. It is of later date than the rest of the stones in the museum.\n\nMeigle 34 is a carved fragment with a scroll engraved on it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50391754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50391754", "title": "Presentation miniature", "text": "Presentation miniature\n\nA presentation miniature or dedication miniature is a miniature painting often found in illuminated manuscripts, in which the patron or donor is presented with a book, normally to be interpreted as the book containing the miniature itself. The miniature is thus symbolic, and presumably represents an event in the future. Usually it is found at the start of the volume, as a frontispiece before the main text, but may also be placed at the end, as in the Vivian Bible, or at the start of a particular text in a collection.\n\nIn earlier manuscripts the recipient of the book may be a dead saint, the founder of a monastery or monastic order, for example, and the person handing over the book the abbot, or sometimes the scribe of the book. The genre is an extension of other forms of dedication portraits, for example wall-paintings or mosaics in churches showing the person who commissioned the church holding a model of it. Ultimately they stretch back to scenes where classical rulers receive tribute, or those where a procession of Early Christian martyrs carry their crowns to present Christ. The miniatures are often found in luxury books presented to the emperor or another major figure, which usually followed significant donations of land to the monastery concerned.\n\nIn the early period the manuscripts concerned are normally religious books, especially liturgical ones. The texts are old, and the \"offering\" represented is the creation of an expensive illuminated manuscript. In the late Middle Ages works, often secular ones, are generally presented by their author or translator, though lavish copies of older texts may also still receive presentation miniatures. In these first cases the \"offering\" is usually the text itself, and the patron had presumably often paid for his own luxury copy himself, though some translators and even authors were also scribes. Now the text dedication to the patron, at this period often long and flowery, came to form part of the work itself, and at least the text was repeated in further copies. Such author's dedications, now far shorter, have remained part of the printed book. Sometimes presentation miniatures were also repeated in subsequent copies.\n\nMichelle Brown distinguishes between presentation miniatures, where the actual book containing the miniature passed between the parties shown, and dedication miniatures in subsequent copies made for other people.\n\nRoyal presentation miniatures are especially a feature of Late Carolingian and Ottonian art, providing a series of portraits of the Ottonian emperors, mostly not actually shown with the book, and a precedent for later rulers. In a continuation and intensification of late Carolingian trends, many miniatures contain miniatures depicting the donors of the manuscripts to a church, including bishops, abbots and abbesses, and also the emperor.\n\nIn some cases successive miniatures show a kind of relay: in the Hornbach Sacramentary the scribe presents the book to his abbot, who presents it to St Pirmin, founder of Hornbach Abbey, who presents it to St Peter, who presents it to Christ, altogether taking up eight pages (with the facing illuminated tablets) to stress the unity and importance of the \"command structure\" binding church and state, on earth and in heaven. The Egbert Psalter also has four pages of presentation scenes, with two each spread across a full opening, the left with a bowing offeror in near profile, the right with the enthroned receiver. Egbert, Archbishop of Trier receives the book in the first pair, then presents it to Saint Peter in the second.\n\nA large proportion of the portraits that survive of monastic scribes, who may also have been the artists for the miniatures, come from presentation miniatures, more typically showing presentations to either saints or other clergy who had commissioned books. Such scenes continue to appear in the Romanesque period.\n\nThe earliest surviving portrait of a reigning English king (coins excepted) and the earliest English presentation miniature shows Æthelstan presenting Saint Cuthbert with the copy of Bede's \"Life of Saint Cuthbert\" containing it, probably in 934. This was presented by Æthelstan to the saint's shrine in Chester-le-Street; southern-based medieval English kings were always careful to pay due respect to Cuthbert, the great saint of the North.\n\nIn the High Middle Ages presentation miniatures in luxury copies of the main liturgical and devotional books, showing the book being presented, tended to be replaced by miniatures of the owner or donor at prayer, sometimes using a book which can be taken as the volume containing the miniature. These often include the object of the prayer, Christ, the Virgin Mary, or a saint. Sometimes the owner is shown being \"presented\" to Christ or the Virgin by his patron saint, as though at court, but these are not generally called \"presentation miniatures\".\n\nThe form did not die out, however. The earliest surviving copy of the \"Grandes Chroniques de France\" was presented by the monks of Saint-Denis, who had compiled the text, to Philip III in about 1274, with two presentation scenes, though neither act as frontispieces.\n\nAs book culture increased in the Late Middle Ages, authors still relied on gifts from patrons to reward their efforts, and it is in this context that the dedication miniature revived. Very often the miniature was in the personal copy made by the patron for his library. The author or translator kneels, holding out his book, and the patron is often surrounded by a group of courtiers, advertising his generosity in encouraging literature. The public and ceremonial presentation of gifts from, but mostly to, the monarch or lord was a great feature of medieval court life, concentrated on the New Year. A high proportion of the surviving portraits of late medieval scholars and artists, and a significant proportion of those of the patrons, come from these miniatures, many of which show individualized features and were probably by artists who had had good opportunity to observe their subjects.\n\nThe French royal family, including their Burgundian cousins, led the fashion, which spread to England and elsewhere. Extensively illuminated books were also presented to royalty as diplomatic gifts, or by ambitious courtiers to the monarch, and these might include presentation miniatures. Sometimes the presentation miniature might be the only one in a book; such was the case with Louis de Gruuthuse's copy of Boccaccios \"De mulieribus claris\" translated into French (BnF, Ms Fr. 133, f 2r).\n\nKing Charles V of France (r. 1338–1380), one of the first great bibliophile medieval monarchs, had a large library and especially encouraged and commissioned translations of books into French, which were very often given a presentation miniature. He continues to be shown in dedication miniatures a century after his death. Louis de Gruuthuse's copy of about 1470 of the \"Pseudo-Seneca\"'s \"De remediis fortuitorum\" translated into French for Charles V has a miniature showing the king receiving the text, but with de Gruuthuse standing to the side (BnF, Ms. fr. 1090, fol. 1). The copy made about 1475 for Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy had a different image. This is a double presentation where firstly Seneca himself hands the text to the translator, who bends a knee to receive it, and then down a passageway in the background the translator kneels to present it to two male figures.\n\nAs here, dedication miniatures for old texts sometimes go well back in history, sometimes giving historic figures the features of contemporary ones. Guillebert de Lannoy (1386–1462), a leading Burgundian nobleman, diplomat and traveller, wrote around 1440 \"L'Instruction de josne prince\" (\"Advice for a Young Prince\"), which he dressed up with a fictional origin in the court of Norway \"long, long ago\", followed by a rediscovery of the manuscript text. The dedication miniature in Charles the Bold's copy illustrates the Norwegian story, but using up-to-date Burgundian costume and, it seems, the faces of the ducal family. Another variation was to show the patron visiting the author, or even the illuminator, as they worked, an indication in the rise in status of those producing manuscripts.\n\nThe form survived the arrival of printed books, though they became much rarer. When Edward IV of England's brother in law, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers had William Caxton print his own translation of the \"Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers\" in 1477, the book he presented to Edward was a special manuscript copied from the printed edition, with a presentation miniature, implying \"that a printed book might not yet have been regarded as sufficiently distinguished for a formal gift of this kind\". Some printed books continued the form in woodcut, with printers such as Antoine Vérard in Paris joining the types of presenters depicted. \n\n"}

After a number of celebrities were spotted wearing the product, interest increased, and the company has since sold over 2 million bracelets. Pura Vida partners with a number of charities, producing bracelets in those charities' colors and donating a portion of those bracelets' sale prices back towards the partner charities.\n\n\"Pura Vida\" means \"pure life\" in Spanish. Pura Vida Bracelets is a retailer that sells bracelets that are hand-made in Costa Rica. The company, which is based in La Jolla, California, was founded by Griffin Thall and Paul Goodman in 2010. Thall and Goodman traveled to Costa Rica together on vacation after graduating from San Diego State University, where they met a pair of bracelet makers and purchased 400 bracelets for $100 to bring back to the United States. The pair sold their original stock at small stores in the Malibu, California, area. After a number of celebrities – including reality television personality Lauren Conrad, soccer player David Beckham, and musicians Rihanna and Skrillex – were seen with the bracelets, Pura Vida saw an increase in web traffic and sales. By late 2013, Pura Vida had grown to a dozen US-based staff and 50 Costa Rica-based staff. By the end of 2015, the number of Costa Rica-based employees had doubled to over 100. As of March 2015, Pura Vida moved 125,000 bracelets a month through 3,400 physical retail outlets and through their website. As of February 2015, over two million bracelets have been sold. Pura vida means \"pure life\" in Spanish; in Costa Rica it is said frequently and has many meanings. In an interview, Thall and Goodman called the term \"the slogan of Costa Rica, just like the word 'aloha' from Hawaii\".\n\nPura Vida also creates bracelets for charitable organizations, as a cause marketing fundraiser; bracelets are produced in a charitable organization's colors, and a portion of the sale of those bracelets goes to that charitable organization. As of November 2015, over $600,000 has been donated to charitable organizations; over 175 charities have been the beneficiaries of this program.

{"id": "93791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93791", "title": "Roseanne Barr", "text": "Roseanne Barr\n\nRoseanne Cherrie Barr (born November 3, 1952) is an American actress, comedian, writer, and television producer. Barr began her career in stand-up comedy at clubs before gaining critical and popular acclaim in the television sitcom \"Roseanne\" (1988–1997; 2018). She won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her work on the show.\n\nBarr was born into a Jewish family living in Salt Lake City, Utah. She became a standup comedian in 1980. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she began to emerge as a celebrity through her role in \"Roseanne\" and other public performances. Barr sparked controversy when performing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at a nationally aired baseball game on July 25, 1990. After singing the anthem in what many perceived to be a deliberately disrespectful manner, Barr grabbed her crotch and spat. This performance was met with condemnation from baseball fans and sportswriters, and was called \"disgraceful\" by then-President George H. W. Bush.\n\nBarr has been active and outspoken on political issues. She won nearly 70,000 votes for president in the general election of 2012, as the presidential nominee of the Peace and Freedom Party. After Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president in 2015, Kelly Weill of \"The Daily Beast\" wrote that Barr \"veered right\" in her politics. After \"Roseanne\" was revived, Trump called her to congratulate her on her show's ratings and thank her for her support. She has frequently defended her support of Trump, and has been criticized for her extensive use of personal attacks, conspiracy theories, and fake news.\n\"Roseanne\" was revived in 2018 on ABC. A ratings success, the revival was initially renewed for an additional season, but was then abruptly canceled on May 29, due to Barr making a controversial tweet, which many called \"racist\" and she later called a \"bad joke\".\n\nRoseanne Barr was born on November 3, 1952, in Salt Lake City, Utah, to a Jewish family. She is the oldest of four children born to Helen (née Davis), a bookkeeper and cashier, and Jerome Hershel \"Jerry\" Barr, who worked as a salesman. Her father's family were Jewish emigrants from Russia, and her maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Austria-Hungary and Lithuania. Her paternal grandfather changed his surname from \"Borisofsky\" to \"Barr\" upon entering the United States.\n\nHer Jewish upbringing was influenced by her devoutly Orthodox Jewish maternal grandmother. Barr's parents kept their Jewish heritage secret from their neighbors and were partially involved in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Barr has stated, \"Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning I was a Jew; Sunday afternoon, Tuesday afternoon, and Wednesday afternoon we were Mormons.\"\n\nWhen Barr was three years old, she got Bell's palsy on the left side of her face. Barr said, \"[so] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened. Then my mother got a Mormon preacher, he prayed, and I was miraculously cured\". Years later, Barr learned that Bell's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon preacher came \"exactly at the right time\".\n\nAt six years old, Barr discovered her first public stage by lecturing at LDS churches around Utah and was elected president of a Mormon youth group.\n\nAt 16, Barr was hit by a car; the incident left her with a traumatic brain injury. Her behavior changed so radically that she was institutionalized for eight months at Utah State Hospital. While institutionalized she had a baby, which she put up for adoption.\n\nIn 1970, when Barr was 18 years old, she moved out by informing her parents she was going to visit a friend in Colorado for two weeks, but never returned.\n\nWhile in Colorado, Barr did stand-up gigs in clubs in Denver and other Colorado towns. She later tried out at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles and went on to appear on \"The Tonight Show\" in 1985.\n\nIn 1986, she performed on a Rodney Dangerfield special and on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" and the following year had her own HBO special called \"The Roseanne Barr Show\", which earned her an American Comedy Award for the funniest female performer in a television special.\n\nBarr was offered the role of Peg Bundy in \"Married... with Children\" but turned it down. In her routine she popularized the phrase, \"domestic goddess\", to refer to a homemaker or housewife. The success of her act led to her own series on ABC, called \"Roseanne\".\n\nIn 1987, \"The Cosby Show\" executive producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner wanted to bring a \"no-perks family comedy\" to television. They hired \"Cosby\" writer Matt Williams to write a script about factory workers and signed Barr to play Roseanne Conner.\n\nThe show premiered on October 18, 1988, and was watched by 21.4 million households, making it the highest-rated debut of that season.\n\nBarr became outraged when she watched the first episode of \"Roseanne\" and noticed that in the credits, Williams was listed as creator. She told Tanner Stransky of \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"We built the show around my actual life and my kids. The 'domestic goddess', the whole thing\". In the same interview, Werner said, \"I don't think Roseanne, to this day, understands that this is something legislated by the Writers Guild, and it's part of what every show has to deal with. They're the final arbiters.\"\n\nDuring the first season, Barr sought more creative control over the show, opposing Williams' authority. Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set. She threatened to quit the show if Williams did not leave. ABC let Williams go after the thirteenth episode. Barr gave Amy Sherman-Palladino and Joss Whedon their first writing jobs on \"Roseanne\".\n\n\"Roseanne\" ran for nine seasons from 1988 to 1997. Barr won an Emmy, a Golden Globe, a Kids Choice Award, and three American Comedy Awards for her part in the show. Barr had crafted a \"fierce working-class domestic goddess\" persona in the eight years preceding her sitcom and wanted to do a realistic show about a strong mother \"who was not a victim of patriarchal consumerism\".\n\nFor the final two seasons, Barr earned $40 million, making her the second-highest-paid woman in show business at the time, after Oprah Winfrey.\n\nBarbara Ehrenreich called Barr a working-class spokesperson representing \"the hopeless underclass of the female sex: polyester-clad, overweight occupants of the slow track; fast-food waitresses, factory workers, housewives, members of the invisible pink-collar army; the despised, the jilted, the underpaid\", but a master of \"the kind of class-militant populism that the Democrats, most of them anyway, never seem to get right\". Barr refuses to use the term \"blue collar\" because it masks the issue of class.\n\nDuring \"Roseanne\"s final season, Barr was in negotiations between Carsey-Werner Productions and ABC executives to continue playing Roseanne Conner in a spin-off. After failed discussions with ABC as well as CBS and Fox, Carsey-Werner and Barr agreed not to continue the negotiations.\n\nShe released her autobiography in 1989, titled \"Roseanne—My Life As a Woman\". That same year, she made her film debut in \"She-Devil\", playing a scorned housewife, Ruth. Film critic Roger Ebert gave her a positive review saying, \"Barr could have made an easy, predictable and dumb comedy at any point in the last couple of years. Instead, she took her chances with an ambitious project – a real movie. It pays off, in that Barr demonstrates that there is a core of reality inside her TV persona, a core of identifiable human feelings like jealousy and pride, and they provide a sound foundation for her comic acting\".\n\nIn 1991, she voiced the baby Julie in \"Look Who's Talking Too\". She was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress.\n\nShe appeared three times on \"Saturday Night Live\" from 1991 to 1994, co-hosting with then-husband Tom Arnold in 1992.\n\nIn 1994, she released a second book, \"My Lives\". That same year, Barr became the first female comedian to host the MTV Video Music Awards on her own. She remained the only one to have done so until comedian Chelsea Handler hosted in 2010. In 1997, she made guest appearances on \"3rd Rock from the Sun\" and \"The Nanny\".\n\nIn 1998, she portrayed the Wicked Witch of the West in a production of \"The Wizard of Oz\" at Madison Square Garden. That same year, Barr hosted her own talk show, \"The Roseanne Show\", which ran for two years before it was canceled in 2000.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, she took on the dual role of hosting a cooking show called \"Domestic Goddess\" and starring in a reality show called \"The Real Roseanne Show\" about hosting a cooking show. Although 13 episodes were in production, a hysterectomy brought a premature end to both projects.\n\nIn 2004, she voiced Maggie, one of the main characters in the animated film \"Home on the Range\".\n\nIn 2005, she returned to stand-up comedy with a world tour.\n\nIn February 2006, Barr performed her first-ever live dates in Europe as part of the Leicester Comedy Festival in Leicester, England. The shows took place at De Montfort Hall. She released her first children's DVD, \"Rockin' with Roseanne: Calling All Kids\", that month.\n\nBarr's return to the stage culminated in an HBO Comedy Special \"Roseanne Barr: Blonde N Bitchin\"', which aired November 2006, on HBO. Two nights earlier, Barr had returned to primetime network TV with a guest spot on NBC's \"My Name Is Earl\", playing a crazy trailer park manager.\n\nIn April 2007, Barr hosted season three of \"The Search for the Funniest Mom in America\" on Nick at Nite.\nIn March 2008, she headlined an act at the Sahara Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2010, she hosted a politically themed radio show on KPFK.\n\nSince 2008, she and partner Johnny Argent have hosted a weekly radio show on Sundays, on KCAA in the Los Angeles area, called \"The Roseanne and Johnny Show\".\n\nOn March 23, 2009, it was announced that Barr would be returning to primetime with a new sitcom, wherein she would once again play the matriarch. Jim Vallely of \"Arrested Development\" had been tapped to pen the series. She later stated on her website that the project had been canceled.\n\nOn April 15, 2009, Barr made an appearance on Bravo's 2nd Annual A-List Awards in the opening scenes. She played Kathy Griffin's fairy godmother, granting her wish to be on the A-List for one night only.\n\nIn February 2010, Barr headlined the inaugural Traverse City Comedy Arts Festival in a project of the Traverse City Film Festival, founded by filmmaker Michael Moore. Moore developed the comedy fest with comedian Jeff Garlin.\n\nIn 2010, Barr appeared in Jordan Brady's documentary about stand-up comedy, \"I Am Comic\".\n\nIn January 2011, Barr released her third book, \"Roseannearchy: Dispatches from the Nut Farm\".\n\nIn 2011, she appeared in a Super Bowl XLV commercial for Snickers along with comedian Richard Lewis. It was the most popular ad, based on the number of TiVo users rewinding and watching it over.\n\nOn July 13, 2011, \"Roseanne's Nuts\", a reality show featuring Barr, boyfriend Johnny Argent, and son Jake as they run a macadamia nut and livestock farm in Big Island, Hawaii was premiered on Lifetime but, was canceled in September of that year.\n\nIn August 2011, it was reported that Barr was working on a new sitcom with 20th Century Fox Television titled \"Downwardly Mobile\". Eric Gilliland was attached as co-creator, writer and executive producer; Gilliland was also a writer on \"Roseanne\". In October 2011, NBC picked up the show but later dropped ir. A pilot was filmed but initially ended up being shelved by the network. Barr called her progressive politics the sole reason behind the pilot's rejection. She said she was notified that the show would not be picked up due to its being labeled \"too polarizing\" by network executives.\n\nBarr was roasted by Comedy Central in August 2012. After stating that he would not, Barr's former spouse Tom Arnold appeared on the roast.\n\nIn the summer of 2014 Barr joined Keenen Ivory Wayans and Russell Peters as a judge on \"Last Comic Standing\" on NBC.\n\nOn November 28, 2014, Barr's series, \"Momsters: When Moms Go Bad\" debuted on the Investigation Discovery cable network, a network that she says she's a \"little obsessed with\". Barr hosts the show as herself.\n\nOn April 28, 2017, it was reported that Barr, along with most of the original cast, were shopping an eight-episode revival of \"Roseanne\", with its original cast and Barr serving as producer, to various networks and Netflix. On May 16, 2017, ABC picked up the revival for mid-season 2018.\n\nOn March 27, 2018, the revived, 10th season of \"Roseanne\" premiered on ABC to high ratings. On March 30, 2018, ABC renewed the series for an 11th season, with thirteen episodes. On May 29, 2018, the series was canceled by ABC in the aftermath of a tweet widely considered to be racist. She and Tom Werner later came to an agreement on relinquishing her producer's stake in a spin-off titled \"The Conners\", which ABC ordered for the fall season soon after.\n\nIn 1970, when she was 17, Barr had a child, Brandi Ann Brown, whom she placed for adoption; they were later reunited. On February 4, 1974, Barr married Bill Pentland, a motel clerk she met while in Colorado. They had three children: Jessica, Jennifer, and Jake. Pentland and Barr divorced on January 16, 1990.\nFour days later, on January 20, 1990, Barr married fellow comedian Tom Arnold and became known as Roseanne Arnold during the marriage. Barr had met Arnold in 1983 in Minneapolis, where he opened for her stand-up comedy act. In 1988, Barr brought Arnold onto her sitcom, \"Roseanne\", as a writer.\n\nBarr has a lesbian sister, Geraldine Barr, and a gay brother, Ben Barr, both of whom inspired her to introduce gay characters into her sitcom. Barr has stated she supports gay marriage. Geraldine was also Barr's manager while performing in comedy clubs and at the start of her sitcom. Geraldine claimed Arnold tried to dominate Barr \"for his own reasons\".\n\nAfter being fired by Roseanne, Geraldine filed a $70.3 million breach of contract lawsuit in Superior Court of Los Angeles County on December 18, 1991. She said Barr promised her half the earnings from the \"Roseanne\" show for helping invent the \"domestic goddess\" character in 1981, serving as \"writer, organizer, accountant, bookkeeper and confidante\". Since it was six months past the statute of limitations, the suit was thrown out.\n\nIn a 1991 interview with \"People\", Barr described herself as an incest survivor, accusing both of her parents of physical and sexual abuse, claims which they and Geraldine publicly denied. Melvin Belli, her parents' lawyer, said they had passed a lie detector test \"with flying colors\". Barr was part of an incest recovery group, something she said her parents knew about but for which they were \"in denial\".\n\nOn February 14, 2011, Barr and Geraldine appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" where Barr admitted the word \"incest\" could have been the wrong word to use and should have waited until her therapy was over before revealing the \"darkest time\" in her life. She told Oprah Winfrey, \"I was in a very unhappy relationship and I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs ... to deal with the fact that I had some mental illness ... I totally lost touch with reality ... (and) I didn't know what the truth was ... I just wanted to drop a bomb on my family\". She added that not everything was \"made up\", saying, \"Nobody accuses their parents of abusing them without justification\". Geraldine said they did not speak for twelve years, but had reconciled.\n\nBarr filed for divorce from Tom Arnold on April 18, 1994 in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, citing irreconcilable differences. Their efforts to have children were unsuccessful.\n\nOn February 14, 1995, Barr married Ben Thomas, her one-time personal security guard, at Caesars Tahoe with a reception at Planet Hollywood. In November 1994, she became pregnant through in-vitro fertilization and they had a son named Buck. The couple stayed together until 2002.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Barr had multiple cosmetic surgeries performed, such as a breast reduction, tummy tuck, and a nose job. During the late 1990s she had gastric bypass surgery.\n\nIn 2002, Barr met Johnny Argent online after running a writing competition on her blog and began dating him in 2003, after a year of phone conversations. They live on a macadamia nut farm located on the Big Island of Hawaii. Barr purchased the property in 2007 for $1.78 million. Barr has studied Kabbalah at the Kabbalah Centre and frequently comments on the discipline.\n\nIn 2015, Barr revealed she had been diagnosed with both macular degeneration and glaucoma, and thus was gradually losing her eyesight and expected to eventually go blind; she was consuming medical marijuana to decrease her intraocular pressure that is a feature of these diseases. Barr later revealed that she was misdiagnosed and that her vision problem is really due to a mole resting behind her eye, which can be corrected through surgery.\n\nIn November 2018, Barr was said to have had a heart attack, but she later went on social media and said she was not suffering from any medical issues.\n\nOn July 25, 1990, Barr performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" off-key before a baseball game between the San Diego Padres and Cincinnati Reds at Jack Murphy Stadium. She later said she was singing as loudly as possible to hear herself over the public-address system, so her rendition of the song sounded \"screechy\". Following her rendition, she mimicked the often-seen actions of players by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. Barr later said that the Padres had suggested she \"bring humor to the song\", but many criticized the episode, including President George H. W. Bush, who called her rendition \"disgraceful\". Barr revisited this incident during her \"Comedy Central Roast\" in 2012, wherein she once again belted out the last few bars of the national anthem, without screeching.\n\nBarr elicited criticism in July 2009 when she posed as Adolf Hitler in a feature for the satirical Jewish publication \"Heeb\" magazine, called \"That Oven Feelin. The Nazi theme was reportedly her suggestion, and featured her with a Hitler mustache and swastika arm-band, holding a tray of burnt gingerbread man cookies the article referred to as \"burnt Jew cookies\". The magazine's publisher, Josh Neuman, said the photos were taken for satire and were not done for shock value. Barr, who is Jewish, said she was \"making fun of Hitler, not his victims\". Fox News TV host Bill O'Reilly was highly critical of her for \"mocking the Holocaust\" and \"Extra\"'s Mario Lopez stated \"Come on, Roseanne. Hitler jokes are never funny.\" The revival of her show in March 2018 caused the photos to resurface on social media and renewed mentions of the incident in the Jewish magazine \"The Forward\" and the \"Los Angeles Times\", among others.\n\nIn 2014, the parents of George Zimmerman, the man known for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin in a fight, filed a lawsuit against Barr for tweeting their home address and phone number in 2012. Zimmerman's parents allege that Barr sought to \"cause a lynch mob to descend\" on their home. In August 2015, summary judgment was granted in favor of Barr.\n\nIn late March 2018, Barr tweeted about a conspiracy theory involving David Hogg, a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. The conspiracy theory falsely claims Hogg gave a Nazi salute at a March for Our Lives rally on March 24. Barr later deleted her tweet.\n\nOn May 29, 2018, Barr responded to a thread on Twitter about Valerie Jarrett, a senior advisor to former President Obama. It read \"muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj\" . The tweet was widely criticized as being racist about Jarrett (\"vj\"). Barr was initially defensive, but later posted an apology \"for making a bad joke about [Jarrett's] politics and her looks.\" She disputed allegations of racism, saying she believed Jarrett was Saudi (or white). Barr also said she made the tweet, which she called wrong and indefensible, at 2:00 am while on Ambien, a sedative. Sanofi, which manufactures Ambien, responded by tweeting that \"racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication\", though noted Ambien had been linked to reduced inhibitions. Later that day, ABC canceled \"Roseanne\" and removed the show's content from the network website. The cancellation announcement from ABC president Channing Dungey, the first African-American woman to head the network, called Barr's remark \"abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.\" Within three weeks, the television show was revived as spinoff \"The Conners\", with mostly the same cast and crew, minus Barr. In a later interview with Sean Hannity, Barr said that her tweet was intended to be a political statement rather than racial one.\n\nOn August 5, 2011, Barr appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" and announced her candidacy for president in the 2012 presidential election, running on the self-created \"Green Tea Party\" ticket. Her candidacy called attention to economics, personal health and meditation.\n\nShe also stated she would run for Prime Minister of Israel. In an interview with \"The Jewish Daily Forward\" she invoked tikkun olam in her support of bringing women into politics and religion.\n\nOn September 19, she appeared at the Occupy Wall Street protests and spoke in support of the protestors. \"She stated any 'guilty' Wall Street bankers should be forced to give up any income over $100 million, and if they are unable to live on that, be sent to re-education camps, and if that doesn't help be beheaded\".\n\nBarr filed with the Federal Election Commission as a Green Party presidential candidate in January 2012. She formally announced her candidacy for the party's presidential nomination on February 2. On July 14, she came in second, losing the nomination to Jill Stein. Stein chose Cheri Honkala as her running-mate after campaign manager Ben Manski said Barr was shortlisted for the job.\n\nBarr was given a prime speaking role at the Green Party National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland, but decided to instead send a surrogate (Farheen Hakeem) to speak on her behalf. Barr's surrogate reportedly chided the party for not respecting Barr's candidacy. A shouting match in a hallway reportedly ensued.\n\nBarr repeatedly criticized Jill Stein after losing the Green Party nomination, and caused controversy by using alleged transphobic words in statements about Stein on Twitter.\n\nShortly after losing the Green Party nomination, Barr announced that she would run on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket with activist Cindy Sheehan as her running mate. On August 4, 2012, Barr won the presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party.\n\nBarr's running mate, Cindy Sheehan, immediately had disagreements with Barr, from Barr's views on policy, to Barr's desire to only campaign online, and Barr's treatment of Green Party nominee Jill Stein, leading Sheehan to request that her name be taken off the Peace and Freedom Party ticket. Sheehan was told it was too late to have her name removed, so she instead announced that she was would be leaving the campaign.\n\nBarr appeared on the ballot in California,\nColorado, and Florida. She did not appear on the ballot in her home state of Hawaii, which did not allow write-in votes. She ended up voting for President Obama. She received 67,326 votes nationwide, placing sixth overall with 0.05% of the popular vote; Stein, who appeared on the ballot of thirty-six states and the District of Columbia, placed far ahead of her in fourth place with 0.36% of the popular vote and 469,627 votes.\n\nBarr was followed by a film crew throughout her entire campaign, with documentarian Eric Weinrib directing, leading to questions about the sincerity of her campaign. Over 300 hours were filmed and were released as a film called \"Roseanne for President!\". Despite questions of her sincerity regarding her campaign, Barr and her family have insisted her desire to run for president was \"very real.\"\n\n\nBarr voiced her support for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in a June 2016 \"The Hollywood Reporter\" interview. \"I think we would be so lucky if Trump won. Because then it wouldn't be Hillary.\"\n\nA July CNN story reported she did not endorse Trump as she only supports herself for president—\"I will be writing myself in in every election from now until I win.\"\n\n\n\nRoseanne Barr has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on the north side of the 6700 block of Hollywood Blvd.\n\n\n"}

With a bell-shaped floorplan and four rows of boxes, it followed the new style of theatres then in vogue. It was intended to host both theatre productions and concerts, and scientific discourses and conventions. Bibiena also provided the monochrome frescoes in the interior. The theatre is now considered to be his most important work.\n\nIt was opened officially on 3 December 1769. A few weeks later, on 16 January 1770, thirteen-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played a concert here, with resounding success. His father, Leopold Mozart, wrote about the theatre: \"In all my life, I have never seen anything more beautiful of its kind\".\n\nIn 1773, Giuseppe Piermarini, who constructed the neighbouring palazzo for the Accademia Virgiliana, designed and built the façade of the theatre.\n\nStill used for its original purposes, it now can also be visited by tourists as one of Mantua's museums.

The painting was completed in 1914 in Italy. It is an example of the Metaphysical art style. The painting measures 81.5 by 65 centimeters and is now housed at Moderna museet, Stockholm. The subject of \"The Child’s Brain\" is a nude young man, seen from the waist up, who is standing in back of a table with his eyes closed.\n\nThe painting depicts a nude young man with a mix of both masculine and feminine features (the feminine being especially prominent in the lack of body hair or defined musculature, the long eyelashes and the finely groomed eyebrows) standing behind a table which blocks our view of him below the waist. On the table is a yellow book with a red bookmark, that has been interpreted as an allegorical representation of male/female intercourse. The man's right arm is hidden from view by a Greek column, connecting this painting to the art of the ancient Greeks, a common theme among de Chirico's work. The man himself is likely a younger version of the figure of Dionysos who appears in later works by de Chirico, such as \"The Phantom\".\n\nThe common interpretation of the painting is that the figure represents de Chirico's father, with the book on the table representing the artists' parent's lovemaking, perhaps witnessed at some point by the young artist.\n\nIn \"The Child’s Brain\", the man depicted has his pelvic area covered by a book. This can be interpreted as the man being faced with the terror of castration which can be found in the psychological work of Sigmund Freud. De Chirico was in tune with Freud's studies, reflecting a fascination with psychosexual stages, particularly the phallic stage. It is at this time that the male child develops an obsession with his genitals, that leads to the realization of gender difference and a fear of castration.\n\n"}

Pastries include biscuits, cakes, custards, puddings, pies and tarts. Confectionery includes candying and conserving flowers, fruits, and roots, as well as jellies, marmalades and decorative \"sugar-works\". Drinks include the making of beer, cider, mead, perry and English wines, as well as cordials. The book ends with a list of suggested bills of fare for every month of the year.\n\nThe book is prefaced with a four-page Introduction \"To All Good Housewives\", beginning \"Worthy Dames, Were it not for the sake of Custom, which has made it as unfashionable for a Book to come abroad without an Introduction, as for a Man to appear at Church without a Neckcloth, or a Lady without a Hoop-petticoat, I should not have troubled you with this.\" The introduction ends with \"Your humble Servant, The Compiler\". There follows \"Some Divertisements in Cookery, us'd at Festival-Times, as Twelfth-Day, &c.\"\n\nThe main text is laid out as a dictionary from Al to Zest.

Cooking conditions are similarly mentioned only in passing, as \"over a gentle Fire\". For example:\n\n\nNott's recipe for hot chocolate is said to be delicious. The bibliographer William Carew Hazlitt, in his 1902 \"Old Cookery Books\", considered Nott well-read and intelligent as he drew his recipes from many sources at home and abroad, including \"to dress mutton the Turkish way\".\n\nNott's \"Queen's Pottage\" is recreated at \"The Gilbert Scott\" restaurant, though \"The Telegraph\" notes that the chef, Marcus Wareing, omits the original cockscombs. Nott's Salmagundy is likewise reworked by Heston Blumenthal in his \"Dinner\" restaurant.\n\n\"The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets\" notes that the \"ubiquitous\" crème brûlée appeared in the \"Dictionary\", but that Elizabeth David had traced Nott's version to François Massialot's recipe in his 1691 \"Cuisinier royal et bourgeois\", rendered as \"Burnt Cream\" in the English translation of his book, \"The Court and Country Cook\" of 1702.

He is also known for his interactive art installations.\n\nTimothy Binkley studied mathematics at University of Colorado at Boulder, earning a B.A. (1965) and an M.A. (1966). His PhD in philosophy, from University of Texas at Austin (1970), explored Ludwig Wittgenstein's use of language.\n\nBinkley has lectured and taught at several colleges and universities in the United States, most notably at School of Visual Arts where he initiated the MFA Computer Art program, the first of its kind in the country. In 1992, he founded the New York Digital Salon, an international exhibition of computer art.\n\nHe has exhibited his interactive art in the United States, Europe, South America, and Asia.\n\nBinkley postulates that twentieth-century art is a strongly self-critical discipline, which creates ideas free of traditional piece-specifying conventions including aesthetic parameters and qualities. The artwork is a piece, and a piece isn't necessarily an aesthetic object—or an object at all. Binkley states that anything that can be thought about or referred to can be labeled an artwork by an artist.\n\nBinkley argues that the computer is neither a medium nor a tool, since both media and tools have inherent characteristics that can be explored through an artist's gestures or physical events for mark-making. Instead, the computer is a chameleon-like or even promiscuous assistant, whose services can be applied to any number of tasks and whose capabilities can be defined endlessly from application to application. Binkley refers to the computer as a non-specific technology and an incorporeal metamedium. Yet the computer contains phenomena not found in other media: namely, a conceptual space where symbolic content can be modified using mathematical abstractions. The notion of an “original” and its consequent value are considered irrelevant, obsolete, or inapplicable to computer art.\n\nBinkley's philosophy extends beyond art and aesthetics to culture itself, whose foundations he believes we are overhauling through our involvement with computers.\n\n\n\n\nBinkley is married to artist and author Sonya Shannon and has a daughter Shelley Binkley, M.D., from a previous marriage to Sue Binkley Tatem.\n"}

The convention is intended to protect \"all traces of human existence having a cultural, historical or archaeological character\" which have been under water for over 100 years. This extends to the protection of shipwrecks, sunken cities, prehistoric art work, treasures that may be looted, sacrificial and burial sites, and old ports that cover the oceans' floors. The preservation of underwater cultural heritage is significant as it allows for the retelling of numerous historical events. As part of its duty to conduct scientific research and provide continuous education on the importance of underwater cultural heritage, UNESCO strives to maintain these sites for the enjoyment of current and future generations. The convention may provide a customary framework to help raise awareness and seek to combat the illegal looting and pirating occurring in waters worldwide. As an international body, member states of the convention agree to work towards the preservation of sunken cultural property within their jurisdiction and the high seas.\n\nAs an international body, UNESCO continues to work towards the preservation of cultural goods worldwide. Similar to cultural property, only physical goods that are bestowed to future generations may fall into the protection of cultural heritage. It is thus a form of inheritance that allows current and future generations to learn about significant historical events. Particular to the concept of heritage, international agreements exist under the Council of Europe such as the 1885 Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage of Europe and the European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. These bodies create broad legal protections around cultural heritage antiquities and sites that are specific to communities worldwide. The 1954 Hague Convention was truly the first international convention that attempted to discuss the protection of cultural heritage. In defining property that is considered 'important' and 'valuable' for the good of the people, the issue of protecting cultural property became noticeable to international parties. It was only in the 1972 UNESCO Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, that the term 'cultural heritage' was employed to define the cultural objects to be protected at an international level However, due to its expansive definition, the concept of cultural heritage was further revised in the 1992 European Convention on the Protection of Archaeological Heritage. They serve to assert the universal value of protecting cultural objects that make up the history and identity of nations.\n\nAlong with the 100-year limitation period, the 2001 UNESCO Convention included the phrase 'cultural, historical or archaeological character' as the qualifying concepts that define underwater cultural heritage. Because many objects of cultural heritage lose their significance when taken out of water, this convention seeks to ensure the preservation of sunken sites.\n\nThe official text of the convention sets out the obligations of the states parties in regards to the protection of underwater cultural heritage, defined in Article 1 as:\n\n\"all traces of human existence having a cultural, historical or archaeological character which have been partially or totally under water, periodically or continuously, for at least 100 years\"\n\nArticles 1–4 define the convention and its objectives, as well as its relation to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the law of salvage.\n\nArticles 5–12 define varying levels of obligations and procedures within the four maritime zones (Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, Exclusive Economic Zone, International Waters) defined by UNCLOS.\n\nArticles 13–21 define further obligations, such as seizing illicitly recovered underwater cultural heritage, cooperating with other states parties, and providing training in underwater archaeology.\n\nArticles 22–35 clarify a number of points relevant to the functional aspects of the convention, such as the creation of statutory bodies, the settlement of disputes between states parties, and modes of ratification.\n\nIn addition to the official text of the convention, an annex of 36 rules governs the practical aspects of activities directed at underwater cultural heritage. States parties are required to ensure that these rules are applied within their territorial sea and contiguous zone, and also that they are adhered to by all nationals and flag vessels.\n\nRules 1–8 define general principles. Key among these are the complete prohibition of the commercial exploitation of underwater cultural heritage and the principle that \"in situ\" preservation should always be considered as a first option. The rules also cover aspects such as project design, conservation, documentation, and reporting.\n\nSituated between admiralty/private maritime law, the law of the sea, and cultural heritage law, the legal framework of underwater cultural heritage law is robust. Admiralty law is a branch entrenched within private international law relating to the control of maritime practices between private entities. Activities that fall under the protection of admiralty law include marine operations, marine salvaging, shipping and receiving. Subject to the common law jurisdiction and handled within domestic court systems, the body of admiralty law seeks to protect the rights and interests of private parties, with respect to practices at sea. On a broader level, this law seeks to fulfill public policy objectives including the safety of life and property, while ensuring the protection of the global marine environments.\n\nThe public international law body of the law of the sea was established to manage inter-state relations regarding practices in international waters. This complex body of law has grown to develop its own principles, particular methods of enforcement and Tribunals. Its primary objective is to create a supportive legal framework to determine the rights and duties of states with respect to their use of the ocean.\n\nIn 1982, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was developed to govern the deep-sea beds vis-à-vis increasing commercial exploitation of sunken objects. In light of the emergence of newly independent states, a need was created for an international legal body that would help protect underwater cultural goods, in waters used by many parties worldwide. Resulting from the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) between 1973 and 1982, the Convention has created many new regulations applicable to nation states. Once signed, the Convention had established two maritime zones with governing international regulations, affixed the maximum depth-level at sea at twelve miles, created specific regimes for international and archipelagic states, and introduced three new international institutions.\n\nThe 2001 UN Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage is a product of international agreement on the adequate conduct of member states at sea. Its legal framework stems from two distinct sections of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), including article 149 and 303.\n\nArticle 149 of the LOSC provides that:\n\" All objects of an archaeological and historical nature found in the\nArea shall be preserved or disposed of for the benefit of mankind\nas a whole, particular regard being paid to the preferential rights\nof the State or country of origin, or the State of cultural origin, or\nthe State of historical and archaeological origin.\" \n\nArticle 303 of the LOSC states that:\n\"1. States have the duty to protect objects of an archaeological and\nhistorical nature found at sea and shall cooperate for this purpose.\n\n2. In order to control traffic on such objects, the coastal State\nmay, in applying article 33, presume that their removal from the\nseabed in the zone referred to in that article without its approval\nwould result in an infringement within its territory or territorial\nsea of the laws and regulations referred to in that article.\n\n3. Nothing in this article affects the rights of identifiable owners,\nthe law of salvage or other rules of admiralty, or laws or practices\nwith respect to cultural heritage.\n\n4. This article is without prejudice to other international\nagreements and rules of international law regarding the protection\nof objects of an archaeological and historical nature.\" \n\nTo ensure that member states abide by the regulations stipulated within the Convention, they are to further adopt the following;\n\n1 Each Party is to adopt domestic legislation that prohibits nationals and vessels from engaging in activities that would purposely interfere with the protection of underwater cultural heritage\n\n2 Each Party is to require that all nationals and vessels report any new discoveries to UNESCO and fellow member states that are considered to be a part of underwater cultural heritage located in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the Continental shelf and Area\n\n3 Each Party is to take appropriate measures to prevent the dealing of objects considered to be underwater cultural heritage. This includes the illicit sale or exportation, as well as trade or seizing of the object found in their territory.\n\nA recorded 22 earthquakes between 320 and 1303 AD on the coast of Pharos in Egypt shook the city of Alexandria, which was home to Pharos Lighthouse. The effects of these earthquakes, and several more in the centuries that followed suggest that the large monument may have fallen into the sea, leaving massive blocks of stone awaiting the exploration mission led by archaeologist Jean-Yves Empereur in 1994. While many components of the old lighthouse are on display at the Kom el-Dikka museum in Alexandria, archaeologists suggest that around 500 pieces remain on the sea floor. Today, the Alexandria Lighthouse is among one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. \nOn July 19, 1545, the British Fleet known as the \"Mary Rose\" sunk to the bottom of the Portsmouth Harbour, in the United Kingdom. While its failures still remain a mystery, is estimated that at least 500 men were trapped in the ship, and only 35 of these escaped to safety In 1982, sixty million people watched as the vessel was lifted out of its resting place, with its 19,000 discovered objects still intact. Due to the preservation of this monument of underwater cultural heritage in the \"Mary Rose\" museum, the public can continue to enjoy the vessel and all of her artifacts.\n\nOff the coast of Sweden in 1628, the pride of the Swedish Navy, the \"Vasa\" sunk deep beneath the frigid waters of the Baltic Sea. Under the orders of King Gustavus II Adolphus, the immense vessel was built to support Swedish military campaigns during the Thirty Years' War, yet was toppled by swift winds at sea. The Vasa remained peacefully underwater until a team of archaeologists raised the wreck in 1961. Fortunately, the wreck and all of its belongings were salvaged, despite its lengthily time spent on the ocean floor. Today, the Swedish \"Vasa\" museum in Stockholm is an emblem of cultural heritage, dedicated to educating public citizens worldwide.\n\nIn 1985, two scientists discovered the \"RMS\" Titanic in the northern waters of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada Within the wreck, 1,800 artifacts were found, deeming the discovery a very important contribution to the field of Underwater Cultural Heritage The \"Titanic\" has raised significant questions surrounding the remaining passengers, the value of the wreck and the items lost therein, as well as the impact of the accident The discovery of the ship, and other sunken wrecks, may have also raised questions about the legal framework of the UN Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage.\n\nAs early as the sixth century BC, as Rome gained control over the Greek colonies of Italy and aligned itself with the western states, it developed a fleet that would allow the state to become the most powerful naval entity. Due to the lawless waters along the eastern coasts of Italy, this area was prevalent in pirating. Modern scholars refer to this area as being \"inhabited by wild, uncivilized tribes, who were active marauders of the land and sea, and were constantly reinforced from the interior\". While many dispute the accounts of these events, the marauding nature of pirates may continue to remain true today. Although naval warfare has decreased in popularity, modern pirates are now turning to alternatives to attain their desired treasures.\n\nToday, it is estimated that three million undiscovered shipwrecks and ruins continue to lie at the bottom of the oceans. With the introduction and growing popularity of scuba-diving since the 1940s, the accessibility of such underwater cultural heritage sites are becoming easier to modern pirates in search of new treasure. Studies have already shown that as of 1974, all known shipwrecks off the coasts of Turkey have been exploited by underwater pirates. Additionally, Israeli archaeologists estimate that at least 60 per cent of cultural objects that once lay in wrecks and sites have now disappeared without any trace. Due to the sheer mass of the world's oceans and the inability to monitor all activity that takes place therein, pirates and underwater thieves continue to pose a significant threat to the preservation of cultural heritage and cultural property.\n\nIn 2006, the UNESCO convention was ratified by an additional state, Portugal, needing international protection for the looting of its underwater cultural heritage sites. At least six international treasure hunting organizations had established themselves off the coasts of Portugal to reap the benefits of the nation's coastline after new legislation had allowed for the sale of artifacts collected underwater during archaeological excavations in 1993. Due to this, physical goods may have been looted without proper care, damaging the cultural property that was left behind. Not only did Portugal face a loss of cultural goods, but also possible facts about its historical events. \n\nAbstaining from signing the 2001 UN Convention, the United States has stipulated that the term \"all traces of human existence\" is too broad, legally and as a mechanism tool for the protection of underwater cultural heritage for the preservation of future generations. A problem that may arise with the 100-year period is that the beginning of this period is not clearly identified in the Convention, nor in the LOSC \n\nA criticism of the LOSC Articles is that they are considered ambiguous and obscure in nature. Article 149 fails to specify the manner in which objects of an archaeological nature are to be preserved of and disposed, as well as which mechanisms should be instituted in their conservation so as to benefit all current and future generations \n\nWith the discovery of the Spanish galleon San José by the Colombian Government, and in an effort to claim the galleon with all its cargo, the Spanish Government tried to use the convention as a measure to stop Colombia from salvaging the ship. Article 13 recognises sovereign immunity over sunken warships, but Colombia is not a participating member of the convention. Separately, Colombia has called the galleon part of its submerged patrimony so it is constitutionally bound to protect and preserve the warship.\n\nAs of May 2018, the treaty has 60 states parties.\n\n\n"}

The Gallo-Roman ruins covered by a glass museum was constructed to protect a historical monument of France.\n\nIn 1959, a few metres from the Vesunna Tower, the remains of a \"domus\" (wealthy urban town house) were discovered. During a project for the construction of rental housing on the site of municipal nurseries, archaeologists carried out surveys which brought to light Gallo-Roman walls adorned with painted plaster, preserved to a height of one meter high. What followed was a series of excavations:\n\n\nUpon discovery, the site was named the \"villa des Bouquets\", after the name of the street that ran parallel to it. It is today called the \"Vesunna domus\".\n\nThere soon appeared the need to ensure a good conservation of the site. The idea of a museum building is old. The first projects had been studied even before the end of the excavations. The decision was finally taken in 1992 by the municipal council of Périgueux. An architectural drawing competition took place in 1993. The museum is a project of Jean Nouvel, an architect born in Fumel, France and a winner of the Pritzker Prize in 2008. The main constraint that weighed on the project by Jean Nouvel was the impact of the future museum on a site that since 1963 had been classified as a historical monument. In response to this need, while ensuring maximum view ability to future visitors, Jean Nouvel has created a project whose philosophy can be summed up in two words: protect and reveal the site:\n\n\nFor the visitor who arrives in the garden of Vésone, the Museum is barely visible between the trees. The glass walls allow the site to be visible from the outside, the building looks like an open window on the past.\n\nThe Vesunna Museum opened its doors to the public on 12 July 2003.\n\nDuring 12 to 14 July 2013, the Vesunna Museum celebrated its ten years with events such as a free concert, a giant picnic in the park of Vésone, a film projection and a reconstruction of a Roman camp at the weekend.\n\nIn 2013, the museum and its amenities were labelled disability friendly for a period of five years.\n\nThe permanent exhibition comprises the discoveries made on the territory of the Petrucores people (Gauls) with a territory equivalent to that of the current Dordogne department. Blocks of limestone from the rampart of the fourth century AD are hung along the \"thick wall\". The collection is divided into two parts: on the mezzanines traces of public life in the city of the Petrocores and objects of daily life on the \"domus\".\n\n\nThe visit is conducted around the \"domus\"' central garden, where you can see a magnificent fresco representing rich marine fauna on a background of red Bordeaux, dating from the middle of the second century AD.\n\nOn the first floor, a room is used for temporary exhibitions. Until November 4, 2012, it was devoted to Jean-Claude Golvin. Discover the presentations from ancient cities from the work of the architect-archaeologist.\n\n"}
{"id": "34035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34035", "title": "Web design", "text": "Web design\n\nWeb design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.\n\nAlthough web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design. However, web design can also be seen from a technological standpoint. It has become a large part of people’s everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, background, and music.\n\nIn 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the World Wide Web. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode browser. In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould. The W3C was created in October 1994 to \"lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability.\" This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.\n\nIn 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique. The HTML markup for tables was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little attention was paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table structures or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing. CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout. This allowed HTML code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved web accessibility, see tableless web design.\n\nIn 1996, Flash (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to ActionScript, and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, animated GIFs and JavaScript. However, because Flash required a plug-in, many web developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to gif animations (if they didn't forego using motion graphics altogether) and JavaScript for widgets. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.\n\nDuring 1998 Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an open source licence, enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software. However, they decided to start from the beginning, which guided the development of the open source browser and soon expanded to a complete application platform. The Web Standards Project was formed and promoted browser compliance with HTML and CSS standards by creating Acid1, Acid2, and Acid3 tests. 2000 was a big year for Microsoft. Internet Explorer was released for Mac; this was significant as it was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, raising the bar in terms of standards compliance. It was also the first browser to fully support the PNG image format. During this time Netscape was sold to AOL and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the browser wars.\n\nSince the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated into peoples lives. As this has happened the technology of the web has also moved on. There have also been significant changes in the way people use and access the web, and this has changed how sites are designed.\n\nSince the end of the browsers wars new browsers have been released. Many of these are open source meaning that they tend to have faster development and are more supportive of new standards. The new options are considered by many to be better than Microsoft's Internet Explorer.\n\nThe W3C has released new standards for HTML (HTML5) and CSS (CSS3), as well as new JavaScript API's, each as a new but individual standard. While the term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new version of HTML and \"some\" of the JavaScript API's, it has become common to use it to refer to the entire suite of new standards (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).\n\nWeb designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are involved in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind them remain the same. Web designers use both vector and raster graphics editors to create web-formatted imagery or design prototypes. Technologies used to create websites include W3C standards like HTML and CSS, which can be hand-coded or generated by WYSIWYG editing software. Other tools web designers might use include mark up validators and other testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web accessibility guidelines.\n\nMarketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market. This can be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the trends of its audience. Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing, meaning, for example, that (B2B) business-to-business website design considerations might differ greatly from a consumer targeted website such as a retail or entertainment website. Careful consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics or overall design of a site do not clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of web navigation, especially on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or business the site is representing to make sure they are portrayed favourably.\n\nUser understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how the website works. This is part of the user experience design. User experience is related to layout, clear instructions and labeling on a website. How well a user understands how they can interact on a site may also depend on the interactive design of the site. If a user perceives the usefulness of the website, they are more likely to continue using it. Users who are skilled and well versed with website use may find a more distinctive, yet less intuitive or less user-friendly website interface useful nonetheless. However, users with less experience are less likely to see the advantages or usefulness of a less intuitive website interface. This drives the trend for a more universal user experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of user skill. Much of the user experience design and interactive design are considered in the user interface design.\n\nAdvanced interactive functions may require plug-ins if not advanced coding language skills. Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design. If the plug-in doesn't come pre-installed with most browsers, there's a risk that the user will have neither the know how or the patience to install a plug-in just to access the content. If the function requires advanced coding language skills, it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the function will add to the user experience. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that doesn't work reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt. It depends on the target audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.\n\nPart of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the page layout. For example, a designer may consider whether the site's page layout should remain consistent on different pages when designing the layout. Page pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning objects in the layout design. The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same set width to match the current most popular browser window, at the current most popular screen resolution, on the current most popular monitor size. Most pages are also center-aligned for concerns of aesthetics on larger screens.\n\nFluid layouts increased in popularity around 2000 as an alternative to HTML-table-based layouts and grid-based design in both page layout design principle and in coding technique, but were very slow to be adopted. This was due to considerations of screen reading devices and varying windows sizes which designers have no control over. Accordingly, a design may be broken down into units (sidebars, content blocks, embedded advertising areas, navigation areas) that are sent to the browser and which will be fitted into the display window by the browser, as best it can. As the browser does recognize the details of the reader's screen (window size, font size relative to window etc.) the browser can make user-specific layout adjustments to fluid layouts, but not fixed-width layouts. Although such a display may often change the relative position of major content units, sidebars may be displaced below body text rather than to the side of it. This is a more flexible display than a hard-coded grid-based layout that doesn't fit the device window. In particular, the relative position of content blocks may change while leaving the content within the block unaffected. This also minimizes the user's need to horizontally scroll the page.\n\nResponsive Web Design is a newer approach, based on CSS3, and a deeper level of per-device specification within the page's stylesheet through an enhanced use of the CSS codice_1 rule. In March 2018 Google announced they would be rolling out mobile-first indexing.Sites using responsive design are well placed to ensure they meet this new approach.\n\nWeb designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of typefaces or type styles. Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which designers mainly use in order to avoid complications.\n\nFont downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in web typography, as well as the usage of font downloading.\n\nMost site layouts incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also avoid center-aligned text.\n\nThe page layout and user interface may also be affected by the use of motion graphics. The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the target market for the website. Motion graphics may be expected or at least better received with an entertainment-oriented website. However, a website target audience with a more serious or formal interest (such as business, community, or government) might find animations unnecessary and distracting if only for entertainment or decoration purposes. This doesn't mean that more serious content couldn't be enhanced with animated or video presentations that is relevant to the content. In either case, motion graphic design may make the difference between more effective visuals or distracting visuals.\n\nMotion graphics that are not initiated by the site visitor can produce accessibility issues. The World Wide Web consortium accessibility standards require that site visitors be able to disable the animations.\n\nWebsite designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards. This is usually done via a description specifying what the element is doing. Failure to conform to standards may not make a website unusable or error prone, but standards can relate to the correct layout of pages for readability as well making sure coded elements are closed appropriately. This includes errors in code, more organized layout for code, and making sure IDs and classes are identified properly. Poorly-coded pages are sometimes colloquially called tag soup. Validating via W3C can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration is made, which is used to highlight errors in code. The system identifies the errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards. This information can then be corrected by the user.\n\nThere are two ways websites are generated: statically or dynamically.\n\nA static website stores a unique file for every page of a static website. Each time that page is requested, the same content is returned. This content is created once, during the design of the website. It is usually manually authored, although some sites use an automated creation process, similar to a dynamic website, whose results are stored long-term as completed pages. These automatically-created static sites became more popular around 2015, with generators such as Jekyll and Adobe Muse.\n\nThe benefits of a static website are that they were simpler to host, as their server only needed to serve static content, not execute server-side scripts. This required less server administration and had less chance of exposing security holes. They could also serve pages more quickly, on low-cost server hardware. These advantage became less important as cheap web hosting expanded to also offer dynamic features, and virtual servers offered high performance for short intervals at low cost.\n\nAlmost all websites have some static content, as supporting assets such as images and stylesheets are usually static, even on a website with highly dynamic pages.\n\nDynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate webpages. They typically extract their content from one or more back-end databases: some are database queries across a relational database to query a catalogue or to summarise numeric information, others may use a document database such as MongoDB or NoSQL to store larger units of content, such as blog posts or wiki articles.\n\nIn the design process, dynamic pages are often mocked-up or wireframed using static pages. The skillset needed to develop dynamic web pages is much broader than for a static pages, involving server-side and database coding as well as client-side interface design. Even medium-sized dynamic projects are thus almost always a team effort.\n\nWhen dynamic web pages first developed, they were typically coded directly in languages such as Perl, PHP or ASP. Some of these, notably PHP and ASP, used a 'template' approach where a server-side page resembled the structure of the completed client-side page and data was inserted into places defined by 'tags'. This was a quicker means of development than coding in a purely procedural coding language such as Perl.\n\nBoth of these approaches have now been supplanted for many websites by higher-level application-focused tools such as content management systems. These build on top of general purpose coding platforms and assume that a website exists to offer content according to one of several well recognised models, such as a time-sequenced blog, a thematic magazine or news site, a wiki or a user forum. These tools make the implementation of such a site very easy, and a purely organisational and design-based task, without requiring any coding.\n\nEditing the content itself (as well as the template page) can be done both by means of the site itself, and with the use of third-party software. The ability to edit all pages is provided only to a specific category of users (for example, administrators, or registered users). In some cases, anonymous users are allowed to edit certain web content, which is less frequent (for example, on forums - adding messages). An example of a site with an anonymous change is Wikipedia.\n\nUsability experts, including Jakob Nielsen and Kyle Soucy, have often emphasised homepage design for website success and asserted that the homepage is the most important page on a website. However practitioners into the 2000s were starting to find that a growing number of website traffic was bypassing the homepage, going directly to internal content pages through search engines, e-newsletters and RSS feeds. Leading many practitioners to argue that homepages are less important than most people think. Jared Spool argued in 2007 that a site's homepage was actually the least important page on a website.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, carousels (also called 'sliders' and 'rotating banners') have become an extremely popular design element on homepages, often used to showcase featured or recent content in a confined space. Many practitioners argue that carousels are an ineffective design element and hurt a website's search engine optimisation and usability.\n\nThere are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, who often work closely together on a website. The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page. Web designers will also have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another. Particularly in smaller organizations one person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full web page, while larger organizations may have a web designer responsible for the visual aspect alone.\nFurther jobs which may become involved in the creation of a website include: \n\n"}

Certain critics have observed this narrative in an array of genres of films in American cinema, wherein a white protagonist is portrayed as a messianic figure who often learns something about him or herself in the course of rescuing characters of color.\n\nThe narrative trope of the white savior is one way the mass communications medium of cinema represents the sociology of race and ethnic relations, by presenting abstract concepts—such as morality—as innate characteristics, racial and cultural, of white people, rather than as characteristics innate to people of color. The white savior usually is a man who is out of place within his own society, until he assumes the burden of racial leadership to rescue non-white foreigners and minorities from their plights. As such, white savior stories \"are essentially grandiose, exhibitionistic, and narcissistic\" fantasies of psychological compensation.\n\nIn \"The Whiteness of Oscar Night\" (2015), Matthew Hughey describes the narrative structure of the subgenre:\n\nA White Savior film is often based on some supposedly true story. Second, it features a nonwhite group or person who experiences conflict and struggle with others that is particularly dangerous or threatening to their life and livelihood. Third, a White person (the savior) enters the milieu and through their sacrifices, as a teacher, mentor, lawyer, military hero, aspiring writer, or wannabe Native American warrior, is able to physically save—or at least morally redeem—the person or community of folks of color, by the film's end. Examples of this genre include films like \"Glory\" (1989), \"Dangerous Minds\" (1996), \"Amistad\" (1997), \"Finding Forrester\" (2000), \"The Last Samurai\" (2003), \"Half Nelson\" (2006), \"Freedom Writers\" (2007), \"Gran Torino\" (2008), \"Avatar\" (2009), \"The Blind Side\" (2009), \"The Help\" (2011), and the list goes on.\n\nFollowing the release of cinematic adaptations of the play \"A Raisin in the Sun\" (1959), by Lorraine Hansberry, and the novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" (1960), by Harper Lee, the films of the blaxploitation genre of the 1970s reflected continued discontent over the social and racial inequality of non-white people in the United States and functioned as counterbalance to the trope of the white savior. Then in the 1980s, continued cultural hypersegregation led to the common misbelief, by many American white people, that the nation had reached a post-racial state of social relations, which resulted in a backlash against the racial and ethnic diversity of the cinema of the previous decades, on screen during the 1960s and the 1970s; thus, the popular cinema of the 1990s and the early 2000s featured the white savior narrative. That reappearance of the white-savior narrative occurred because the majority of white people in the United States had little substantive social interaction with people of different races and ethnic groups.\n\nThe white-savior teacher story, such as \"Up the Down Staircase\" (1967), \"Dangerous Minds\" (1995), and \"Freedom Writers\" (2007), \"features a group of lower-class, urban, non-whites (generally black and Latino/a) who struggle through the social order in general, or the educational system specifically. Yet, through the sacrifices of a white teacher they are transformed, saved, and redeemed by the film's end.\" As an inspirational tale of the human spirit, the storyline of the white-savior-teacher is not racist, in itself, but is culturally problematic for being racialist, because it is a variant of the white-savior narrative that factually misrepresents the cultural and societal reality that there exist minority-group teachers who have been successfully educating (racial, ethnic, cultural) minority-group students in their communities, without the saving stewardship of white people.\n\nThe white savior's principled opposition to chattel slavery and to Jim Crow laws makes him advocate for the humanity of slaves and defender of the rights of black people unable to independently stand within an institutionally racist society, in films such as \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" (1962), \"Conrack\" (1974), and \"Amistad\" (1997). Despite ostensibly being stories (fictional and true) about the racist oppression of black people, usually in the Southern United States (American South), the white-savior narrative relegates characters of color to the story's background, as the passive object(s) of the dramatic action, and in the foreground places the white man who militates to save him, and them, from the depredations of racist white folk, respectively: a false accusation of inter-racial rape, truncated schooling, and chattel slavery.\n\nThe list shows films that have been associated with the cinematic trope.\n\n\n"}

He wrote a considerable number of novels, biographies, histories, essays (especially about the dangers of alcohol and the plight of the poor) and popular fantasy stories, mostly in the 1860s and 1870s. Some of these have been reprinted in recent decades and are still available today. He is best remembered, however, as the father of dramatist W. S. Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan.\n\nGilbert was born at Bishopstoke, Hampshire, the eldest son of William (1780–1812), a grocer in Commercial Row, Blackfriars, London, and his wife Sarah \"née\" Mathers (1782–1810). Both his parents died of tuberculosis by the time William was seven years old, and thereafter, he and his younger siblings, Joseph and Jane, were raised in London by their mother's sister and her husband, Mary \"nee\" Mathers (b. 1778) and John Samuel Schwenck (d. 1865), a childless and financially comfortable couple. Gilbert's father had also left the children legacies that would be invested by their uncle until the youngest had reached age 21, so Gilbert's would not be due to him until age 26. With the three young Gilbert children, the Schwencks soon moved from Lambeth to a larger house in Clapham, where they raised the children with affection.\n\nGilbert served the East India Company as a midshipman from 1818 (age 14) to 1821 but was unhappy with the conditions, and so he quit the service. He then spent several years in Italy, returning to England about 1825. There he studied at Guy's Hospital and served as an assistant surgeon in the navy, and then he entered the Royal College of Surgeons in 1830. At this time, he received his an annuity from his father's estate, giving him financial independence, and also published a volume of his poetry. He first married Mary Ann Skelton in 1832, who died two years later at around age 20. By this time, he had privately published another book, but after the death of his wife, he published no more for many years. He married Anne Mary Bye Morris (1811–1888), age 24, on 14 February 1836. She was the daughter of Thomas Morris (1760–1849), an apothecary, and Christiana \"nee\" Sutherland (1777–1845). The couple's famous son, W. S. Gilbert, was born on 18 November 1836 at the Morris's house in Southampton Street. The Gilberts then moved to Hammersmith, near Anne's sister Harriet and her family.\n\nIn 1838, Gilbert took his wife and toddler on a long trip to Italy, where he had lived as a young man. There, their daughter Jane Morris Gilbert (1838–1906) was born. In 1841, Gilbert's brother and sister, Joseph and Jane, both died of tuberculosis. Gilbert received some property owned by his sister and became a potential co-guardian to Joseph's two young sons, together with the Schwencks. In 1843, his daughter Mary Florence (1843–1911) was born. In early 1845, Gilbert decided to take custody of his two young nephews from their mother, Catherine, who had begun a relationship with an officer of the East India Company. She brought a custody lawsuit and her children were returned to her. Amidst considerable publicity critical of Gilbert and the Schwencks, Gilbert fled with his young family to Boulogne, France, where his daughter, Anne Maude (1845–1932), was born. The family lived there for two years and returned to London in 1847, moving to Brompton.\n\nGilbert and Anne \"led an increasingly quarrelsome life\" in London.\n\nGilbert began his writing career around 1857. He was concerned, throughout his life, with the welfare of the poor and served as honorary secretary of the Society of the Relief of Distress. His interest in the poor is evident in his writing, and one of his recurring themes was that poverty and alcohol, not genealogy, was the major cause of crime and the main factor in one's later fortunes. This theme would also be seen in his son's writing. One of the elder Gilbert's first pieces was a pamphlet entitled, \"On the Present System of Rating for the Relief of the Poor in the Metropolis\" (1857). In 1858, anonymously, Gilbert published \"Dives and Lazarus, or the adventures of an obscure medical man in a low neighbourhood.\" The book was a fictional account focusing on what Gilbert saw as the increasing disparity in the lives of the rich and the poor. A similar theme pervades another early Gilbert novel, \"The Weaver's Family\" (1860). This theme continued to concern Gilbert throughout his career including in \"Contrasts; dedicated to the ratepayers of London\" (1873) and in one of his fiercest attacks on social abuses, \"The City; An Inquiry into the Corporation, its livery companies, and the administration of their charities and endowments\" (1877), describing how 50,000 working-class people were evicted from their dwellings to make room for the Metropolitan Railway. In an age of male chauvinism, Gilbert also wrote several articles about discrimination against women.\n\nIn 1859, Gilbert published a novel, \"Margaret Meadows, A Tale for the Pharisees\". This was made into a play called \"Mary Warner\" by Tom Taylor in 1869, who was forced to pay Gilbert a settlement for plagiarising his novel. Gilbert's most successful early novel was \"Shirley Hall Asylum: Or the Memoirs of a Monomaniac\" (1863), which told the stories of inmates of a lunatic asylum from the point of view of an escapee driven mad by trying to solve the problem of perpetual motion. Gilbert's first novel published under his own name was \"Christmas Tale: The Rosary, a Legend of Wilton Abbey\" (1863). The story purports to be the written confession of one Alicia Longspée, who had been Lady Abbess of the Benedictine Convent at Wilton in the 15th century. Gilbert's next novel, \"De Profundis, a tale of the social deposits\" (1864) is the story of a foundling rescued by a Scottish Fusilier Guardsman stationed in London. The foundling grows up to marry the guardsman's daughter. Another 1864 book was \"The Goldsworthy Family, or the country attorney\", about an unethical lawyer.\n\nGilbert's 1865 book, \"The Magic Mirror\" (about a mirror that grants wishes), containing stories with a moral was illustrated by his multi-talented son. Gilbert also wrote histories and articles and stories for numerous periodicals (often anonymously), including \"Cornhill, Temple Bar, St. Paul's, the Quiver, The Contemporary Review, The Sunday Magazine, Good Things, Good Words, Strahan's Boy's and Girl's (sic) Annual\" and \"The Fortnightly Review\".\n\nAmong Gilbert's best-known, and most popular, works were his \"Innominato\" tales of the supernatural, published in various magazines, including \"Argosy\", and finally collected in \"The Wizard of the Mountain\" (1867). One of the best-known is \"The Last Lords of Gardonal\" (1867). These stories concerned the adventures of an enigmatic wizard and astrologer called the Innominato (in English, \"Nameless\"), in 14th century Italy, who tried to use his powers to help people.\n\nIn 1868, Gilbert wrote \"The Doctor of Beauweir, an autobiography\", told from the point of view of a South Wales medic. \"King George's Middy\" (1869), also illustrated by W. S. Gilbert, relates the adventures of a Leicestershire squire's son who becomes a midshipman and is marooned of the coast of Africa. Another 1869 novel was Sir Thomas Branston. Later that year, Gilbert produced his most famous biography, \"Lucrezia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara: a biography: Illustrated by rare and unpublished documents\". In this work, Gilbert concluded, after extensive research, that there was no evidence of the acts of gross immorality of which Borgia was accused, including murder. This was followed in 1870 by \"The Inquisitor, or the Struggle in Ferrara\", about the life of Renée of France, Duchess of Ferrara, set in 1554.\n\nIn 1871, the novel \"Martha\" was followed by \"The Landlord of the \"Sun\"\", again describing a descent into degradation, this time involving a villainous seducer, an illegitimate child and drunkenness, and, in 1873, by \"Clara Levesque.\" Another theme that was seen in Gilbert's writings was his dislike of established religion and the Roman Catholic Church in particular. Two works on this theme included \"Facta non Verba: a comparison between the good works performed by the ladies in Roman Catholic communities in England and the unfettered efforts of their Protestant sisters\" (1874) and \"Disestablishment from a Church point of view\" (1875).\n\nGilbert had a mercurial temper and was difficult to live with, imposing arbitrary restrictions on his wife and daughters. After many years of strained relations with his wife, Gilbert left home and separated from her in 1876 after forty years of marriage. He left his wife and daughters substantial incomes and the family home, assuming that he would be able to earn a good living from his writing. However, he soon became seriously ill and appeared to be dying, and his doctors advised him not to write. His wife did not assist in his care and did not, ultimately, allow him to return home. Her son appealed to her on his father's behalf, but she would not change her mind. W. S. Gilbert apparently never contacted his mother again. Instead, Gilbert went to live with Jane, his only married daughter, and her husband in The Close at Salisbury, where he resided for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1877, Gilbert published \"Them Boots\", another description of characters from the lowest class of society, as well as \"The City\". Pursuing another favourite theme, the dangers of drink, Gilbert also published in 1877 \"Nothing but the Truth, an unvarnished picture of the effects of intemperance\", and example of his many writings about the dangers of alcohol. 1879 saw the publication of \"Mrs. Dubosq's Bible\", about a French Huguenot group in Spitalfields in the 18th century, and the possession of a 1650 Geneva Bible by a poor person. In 1880, \"Memoirs of a Cynic\" was a protest against cruelty and hypocrisy. This was followed in 1881 by \"Modern Wonders of the World, or the new Sinbad\", a series of 10 stories told to London children by Hassan, the son of an Egyptian slave dealer. His last book, published in 1882, \"Legion, or the modern demoniac\", returns to Gilbert's campaign against drink, which, he illustrated, leads to \"crime, profligacy, suicide, homicide, brutality, cruelty, pauperism, idiocy and insanity.\"\n\nGilbert died at the age of 86 and was buried in The Close at Salisbury. Direct descendants of the Gilbert family still live in Cornwall, England.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Today it is held in the Museo Lázaro Galdiano, Madrid.\n\nIt was purchased in 1798 along with five other paintings related to witchcraft by the Duke and Duchess of Osuna. The acquisition of the witchcraft paintings is attributed to the duchess rather than her husband, but it is not known whether they were commissioned or bought after completion.\nIn the twentieth century the painting was purchased by the financier José Lázaro Galdiano and donated to the Spanish state on his death.\n\"Witches' Sabbath\" shows the devil in the form of a garlanded goat, surrounded by a coven of disfigured, young and aging witches in a moonlit barren landscape. The goat possesses large horns and is crowned by a wreath of oak leaves. An old witch holds an infant in her hands. The devil seems to be acting as priest at an initiation ceremony for the child, though popular superstition at the time believed the devil often fed on children and human fetuses. The skeletons of two infants can be seen; one discarded to the left, the other held by a crone in the centre foreground.\n\nTypical of the imagery of witchcraft, many of the symbols used are inverted. The goat extends his left rather than right hoof towards the child, while the quarter moon faces out of the canvas at the top left corner. In the middle high-ground, a number of bats can be seen flying overhead, their flocking motion echoing the curve of the crescent moon.\n\nGoya used the imagery of covens of witches in a number of works, most notably in one of his \"Black Paintings\", \"Witches' Sabbath or The Great He-Goat\" (1821–1823).\n\nInterest in the supernatural was a feature of Romanticism, and is to be found for example in Weber's opera \"Der Freischütz\". However, in a Spanish context, Goya's paintings have been seen as a protest against those who upheld and enforced the values of the Spanish Inquisition, which had been active in Witch hunting during the seventeenth-century Basque witch trials. The later \"Witches Sabbath\" was painted as a bitter struggle raged between liberals and those in favour of a church and a royalist-lead state, which culminated in the so-called Ominous Decade (1823-1833).\nBoth paintings can be seen as an attack on the superstitious beliefs rife in Spain during a period when tales of midnight gatherings of witches and the appearance of the devil were commonplace among the rural populace.\nThey reflect the artist's disdain for the popular tendency towards superstition and the church-led return to medieval fears. Goya's depictions of such scenes mocked what he saw as medieval fears exploited by the established order for political and capital gain.\n\n"}
{"id": "56377831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56377831", "title": "Xianzi (monk)", "text": "Xianzi (monk)\n\nXianzi (), or Kensu in Japanese, also known as the Shrimp Eater, was a semi-historical Chan/Zen monk, considered to be one of the “scattered sages,” who were deviant or otherwise unusual figures within the Chan tradition. Infamous for his iconoclastic breaking of the taboo on eating meat set forth in the Vinaya Code of monastic rules, the Shrimp Eater appears in several traditional Zen paintings as both a comedic figure that underscores the Zen tradition of humor, as well as an eccentric, enlightened individual.\n\nMost information on Xianzi comes from the \"Transmission of the Lamp\", a collection of hagiographies (1004-1007 C.E.) intended to highlight the “anti-textualism and iconoclasm of the Chan monks”. Included within this collection of hagiographies are many nontraditional Chan Buddhist figures, such as Xianzi, who never became patriarchs or abbots on their own, but whose stories were still considered vital for the transmission of Chan teachings. Additional information on Xianzi comes from the poems and inscriptions that monks wrote on paintings of him. One such inscription on a painting of Xianzi by the Japanese painter Josetsu reads:\nedit.Since there is very little hard information on Xianzi other than what is written in the \"Transmission of the Lamp\", inscriptions such as these are important in understanding the context in which he was discussed, the role that he played in Zen teaching, as well as in filling in some of the basic details of his life story.\n\nIt is recorded in the Jing-de Era Record that Xianzi lived in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and was a pupil to Dongshan Liangjie 洞山良價, the founder of the Caodong 曹洞, or Sōtō, school of Chan Buddhism. Though he was known to never have taken students of his own or teach the dharma (Sengai), Xianzi was renowned for his eccentricities. Specifically, he was known to catch and eat shrimp, clams, and prawns from nearby lakes and streams, despite the Buddhist prohibition against consuming meat. Paradoxically, Xianzi was said to have attained enlightenment a moment after he had caught a shrimp and was preparing himself to consume it. For this reason, he was understood to be an enlightened individual and carrier of the transmission, rather than a degenerate monk and rule breaker.\n\nIn addition to his eccentricities regarding the consumption of meat, Xianzi was known as a wanderer, never living in or belonging to an official monastery despite his lineage ties to the founder of one of Chinese preeminent schools of Chan Buddhism. Instead, he preferred to mingle with laypeople, spending most of his days catching his dinner. He did not wear the elaborate robes of a more traditional Chinese monk, instead wearing the same ragged robe during both summer and winter. At night, he slept beneath the paper offerings at the White Horse Temple, much as a homeless would in the modern day. Some have even speculated that he was crazy, although some secondary sources suggest that he was just feigning madness.\n\nThe Vinaya was the set of rules and principles that governed many Buddhist monastic communities. Among these rules were prohibitions against having sexual intercourse, regulations on begging, and an iron-clad ban on eating meat. Monks who broke these rules were said to have committed “pārājika,” or the eight misbehaviors and were declared “asaṃvāsa,” which means outside of the Buddhist religious community. Those deemed outside of the Buddhist religious community were not excommunicated per se, but rather were seen as deviants who were not representative of the tradition that they espoused. As someone who routinely ate fish, Xianzi would have certainly been considered asaṃvāsa under the Vinaya Code. The very paintings of Xianzi violate the Vinaya Code to a certain degree, because scholarship shows that originally, the code prohibited humor and laughter, believing it to be counterproductive to a monk’s serious undertakings.\n\nOther parts of the Vinaya Code insist on humility and poverty. The expensive, elaborate robes of high society were frowned on, and monks were supposed to wear the cast-off rags of society. Additionally, in the late 8th century, the Chan master Bozhang recognized the changing dynamics of monastic life, and created the Bozhang qinggui 百丈淸規, which were additional rules for monastic life. These new rules reformed the ways that monks obtained their food, mandating that monks devote part of their time not just to begging for alms, but instead providing some sort of labor, causing monks to work for their food. Many farms were set up alongside monasteries as a result. Although Xianzi did break some basic Vinaya rules, he also upheld others. His dress is simple and although his consumption of meat may have been blasphemous, he did fulfill the responsibility laid out in the Bozhang qinggui of laboring for his food.\n\nHumor is thought to be one of the defining elements of Chan/Zen teaching, and that humor is almost certainly reflected in the case of Xianzi. Some argue that Chan/Zen masters used humor as a means of conveying its essential wordless transmission. In a similar way that Mahākāśyapa wordlessly received the transmission of the dharma through Śākyamuni Buddha’s flower sermon, so too will those who look upon a humorous Chan/Zen painting wordlessly receive the transmission, provided that they get the joke. Understanding humor requires rigor and training, because humor without full-mindedness is grotesque and meaningless, while full-mindedness without awareness of its limitations is empty. In this way, it is argued that Chan/Zen humor is used to replicate the experience of no-mind that Chan/Zen teachings are based on.\n\nZen humor, as in the case of Xianzi, is typically irreverent and iconoclastic. The paradox of Xianzi is that even though he shamelessly breaks monastic rules by eating meat, that is the way in which he achieved enlightenment. An inscription on a painting of Xianzi by the Chinese monk-painter Muqi Fachang 牧溪法常 (ca. 1210-ca. 1279) alludes to this, reading:\n.This kind of irreverence for Buddhist teachings and traditions is repeated in other figures such as the ebullient Budai/Hotei 布袋, known literally as the laughing monk. It is speculated that the reason for Chan/Zen’s strong use of humor is that although Chan/Zen Buddhism held itself as being unique for having received the true transmission in an unbroken lineage from Shakyamuni Buddha, in everyday life there were few things that separated Chan/Zen monks from those of other sects. They frequently lived in the same monasteries, abided by the same rules, and read the same sutras. Humor was used to differentiate Chan/Zen from the rest, because it made fun of the very precepts that all of the other schools adhered to so rigorously. By asserting its iconoclastic side, Chan/Zen teachings professed their true knowledge and possession of the transmission.\n\nXianzi is one of several traditional Chan/Zen figures known as the “scattered sages,” many of which are depicted with in the same humorous, iconoclastic light. Examples of other Scattered Sages include the laughing monk Budai/Hotei, Tanka 丹霞 the icon burner, the Four Sleepers (Hanshan 寒山, Shide 拾得, Fenggan 豐干, and Fenggan’s tiger,) and Zhimeng 智猛.\n\nZhimeng in particular bears similarities to Xianzi, because he was a figure famous for eating pig’s heads as his favorite treat, much in the same way that Xianzi favored eating shrimp. As a result of their similarities, it was not uncommon for hanging scrolls of Xianzi and Zhimeng to be exhibited together. The artist Josetsu (1405-1496,) for instance, painted the two individually, but their paintings are strikingly similar and are displayed together.\n\nSome scholars theorize that many of the Scattered Sages actually predate Chan/Zen Buddhism and exist outside of its religious context. They were absorbed into the Chan/Zen pantheon as a means of co-opting traditional Chinese culture, enhancing Chan/Zen’s cultural appeal and diverting local customs into a Buddhist framework. However, the evidence for this in the case of Xianzi is limited and no hard conclusions can be drawn.\n\nAlthough his name can be translated as “Master Clam” and in his biography he is said to have eaten both shrimp and clams, Xianzi is always painted holding a shrimp in his hand and never a clam. Additionally, he is frequently painted with his fishing net in one hand to show that he caught his prey himself. His beard is always painted with blurry grey brushstrokes, and although his robes are always relatively simple and never decorated or elaborate, sometimes they more closely resemble the traditional robes of monk, rather than those of a peasant. His humble lifestyle is never drawn into question and his poverty is always made clear. Lastly, all known paintings of Xianzi show him eating shrimp – details of his life outside of his shrimp-eating habit are sometimes alluded to in the inscriptions and poems written at the top of the painting, but they are never explicitly shown.\n\nMuch of Xianzi’s iconography remains the same from painting to painting, but there seem to be three general categories of depicting him; in one, Xianzi holds the shrimp above his head with his mouth open as if to eat it, while in the second he holds it in front of his face at eye level, intently examining it. In the former category, Xianzi is also frequently smiling and standing more informally, while in the latter category his posture is more restrained. Although when Xianzi is painted looking at the shrimp with his mouth closed he can either be wearing the robes of a monk or the simpler, more ragged robes of the destitute, he is never painted both with his mouth open to eat the shrimp and the robes of a monk. In those paintings, his dress is not representative of the monastic tradition. The third way in which Xianzi is painted shows him actually fishing, with one shrimp already in his hand to show what exactly he is doing. He is intent on his work and pursues no other activities.\n\nLike many paintings done of the “scattered sages,” all paintings of Xianzi are done in the style of apparition painting. They are monochromatic ink paintings, frequently executed on hanging scrolls. The reason for the dominance of this particular style is that even though most paintings of Xianzi and other Scattered Sages were done by monk painters, it is understood that the audience they were trying to appeal to was the Chinese literati and scholastic community of Song Dynasty China, which preferred the apparition painting style. These paintings were frequently given as gifts to members of the scholar elite, and so they naturally reflected the tastes of their recipients.\n\n"}
