Before the rebellion, the theatre was controlled by the managers Theophilus Cibber, John Ellys, and John Highmore. When Theophilus lost his share and was denied a bid to run the theatre, he, along with other actors, attempted to take over the theatre by controlling the lease. When the shareholders found out, they refused to admit the actors to the building and the theatre was closed for several months. The fight spilled over to the contemporary newspapers, which generally sided with the managers.\n\nThe Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a new company of actors, though they were less experienced and talented than the old crew. The majority of old actors moved to the Little Theatre, Haymarket, though a few remained loyal. Henry Fielding sided with the managers and produced several plays to aid the Theatre Royal, though this caused a backlash when the rebelling actors finally won the dispute. By the end of 1733, the rebellious actors managed to seize legal control of the theatre's property and Highmore, the sole manager of the Theatre Royal at the time, lost all legal abilities to stop them. By February 1734, he sold his shares to Charles Fleetwood who then made an agreement with the actors that secured their return.\n\nThe Theatre Royal, Drury Lane was run by the holders of one of the two official licenses, or letters patent, established by Charles II in 1660. It was operated by Christopher Rich from 1693 until 1714. He was replaced after his death by three actors, Colley Cibber, Thomas Doggett, and Robert Wilks. After Doggett died, Barton Booth took over his share. In 1730, a notice in the \"Daily Journal\" stated that a patent would be issued to Booth, Cibber, and Wilks authorising the official government license to run the Theatre Royal. After bureaucratic delays, the official patent was given to the three managers only in 1732 that was to last for 21 years. On 13 July 1732, Booth, in poor health, decided to sell half of his share to Highmore, a fellow actor and a socialite. On 27 September, Wilks died and his share was inherited by his widow, who then authorised Ellys, a painter, to serve in her place. In reaction to the changing partners, Colley Cibber rented his share to his son Theophilus, an actor.\n\nThe new management group had two members, Highmore and Ellys, who were incompetent and Theophilus Cibber was known to be both arrogant and volatile. By the end of 1732, there were problems with the management of the theatre, which resulted in the failure of Charles Johnson's \"Caelia: or, The Perjured Lover\" on 4 December. The 8 March 1733 \"Grub-Street Journal\" seized on the event and used the failure to criticise the theatre's management: \"how insufficient the present managers of Drury-lane playhouse are to discharge their trust, as directors of our public entertainments.\" The newspaper was not the only group concerned and many plays were soon cancelled.\n\nMatters were complicated by mass illnesses spreading across London; the epidemic, probably flu, reduced the number of actors able to work and many plays were cancelled. Even Henry Fielding's play \"The Miser\", which was to open early January, was postponed because of the poor health of its cast members, including Theophilus. \"The Miser\" was eventually staged in mid February and was successful, but another of his plays, \"Deborah: or, a Wife for You All\", lasted only one night on 6 April 1733. Regardless of the problems plaguing the season, it was positive for Fielding while it lasted, with six of his plays being produced on stage along with Thomas Arne's \"The Opera of Operas\", Fielding's \"Tom Thumb\" set to music.\n\nHighmore and Ellys, both gentlemen and not actors, insisted on actively participating in every day-to-day decisions regarding scheduling, choice of plays, expenses, actors' behaviour. Their management style clashed with Theophilus, when he recovered and returned in February. They denied his play \"The Harlot's Progress\" instead putting a play by Ellys. The fighting between the managers coincided with poor attendance from both the epidemic in London and other theatres attracting audiences with popular operatic performances. Theophilus's play \"The Mock-Officer\" failed, which caused Highmore and Ellys to turn further against him. However, his 31 March 1733 \"The Harlot's Progress\", based on William Hogarth's painting of the same name, proved to be very successful and embarrassed the two other managers.\n\nWhile Theophilus Cibber was disputing with Highmore and Ellys, Aaron Hill became interested in partnering at the Theatre Royal. Hill was earlier a partner at the theatre until he was removed during a previous actor riot that took place in June 1710. On 22 March 1733, Hill, in a letter to Benjamin Victor, a dramatist who had arranged the sale of Booth's shares to Highmore, criticised the fact that he was kept from buying into the theatre's management and attacked Theophilus. He offered 900 pounds for three years for Booth's shares and 1800 pounds for Mary Wilks's shares. Negotiations continued until May when they were dropped. Hester Booth, widow of Barton Booth, sold her remaining shares to Henry Giffard, the manager of Goodman's Fields Theatre, just few days after her husband died on 10 May.\n\nBy this time, many of the partners, including Wilks, Ellys, and Colley Cibber, no longer wanted to be a part of the theatre and sought to sell their shares. When Colley sought to rent out his share to his son for 300 pounds a year, Highmore approached Colley in order to buy. News of Colley's selling of the shares to Highmore first appeared in the \"Daily Post\" of 27 March 1733. The sale price was around 3000 guineas and 3500 pounds. Theophilus was upset that his father sold the share to Highmore instead of continuing to rent it out to himself. The share, as Theophilus believed, was his \"Birthright\".\n\nTheophilus first tried to work with Highmore and asked to run the operations of the theatre. However, he was turned down, which provoked him to stir the actors into a rebellion. Many of the actors were upset about the management changes and theatre's operations. Highmore did not have experience in theatre, refused to listen to actors' ideas, and cut their salaries in half. Theophilus was known as a successful manager and a good actor. The rebellious actors' plan was to take over the lease and then deny the use of the building to the shareholders, who did not own the complex that they set their stage in. The actors would then use their control over the building to negotiate renting of the patent so they could control how the theatre was run.\n\nWhen the actors tried to rent the building, the remaining shareholders found out about it. They responded by refusing admittance to the actors. The building was shut down and no plays were performed. According to the \"Daily Post\" of 29 May 1733:\nThe actors petitioned Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, the Lord Chamberlain, and requested that he settle the dispute, but he refused to involve himself in the matter. By early June, the actors had control of the theatre through the lease, but the management refused to leave. The actors tried to file for the management to be legally removed from the property, but the court system was slow to respond.\n\nThe management continued to cause problems for various actors, including Benjamin Griffin. Griffin was fired from the theatre on 4 June 1733. He responded in the \"Daily Post\" on 11 June 1733 with a history of the events since he first started in 1721 until his removal. He accused the management of bad treatment and wrote:\nI could give the Publick a great many Instances of the \"Gentlemen's\" Mismanagement and of Injuries done to the Company this Season in their Direction. But when I affirm that they have no Experience, no Knowledge, no Capacity, \"For Gathering together, Forming, Entertaining, Governing, Privileging, and Keeping a Company of Comedians\" ... more than the being able to purchase the \"Patent\" [...] it is a Truth that if any one does not now believe, I am positive that they will in a very little Time be thoroughly convinced of.\n\nMany of the local newspapers were quick to respond to the rebellion. An article in \"The Craftsman\" dated 2 June 1733 described the actors as \"malecontent Players\" who were busy in mutiny. On 7 June, the \"Grub-Street Journal\" stated, in an article by Musaeus, that Theophilus was selfish. Another article in the \"Grub-Street Journal\", by Philo Dramaticus, attacked the management for not understanding how theatres are supposed to work. The managers were the first to state their defence and argued that everything they did was correct and that the actors had no reason to complain, especially over the treatment that they received.\n\nThe actors responded later in June with \"A Letter from Theophilus Cibber, , To John Highmore, Esq\". Within the response, Theophilus Cibber emphasised the inability of the management to effectively run the theatre, claimed that they were acting like tyrants, and alleged that they unjustly refused the offer by the actors to rent out the patent. This did not calm the dispute; instead, the \"Grub-Street Journal\" of 14 June 1733 printed parts of John Vanbrugh's \"Aesop\", a play that criticised the actor rebellion that took place in 1695. On 26 June, the \"Grub-Street Journal\" in an article by Musaeus claimed that many of the problems that the actors complained about were caused by previous managers, who were also actors, and not by the current management that was composed of outsiders. Additionally, Musaeus claimed that actors in general were unfit to run the theatre.\n\nA pamphlet titled \"An Impartial State of the Present Dispute Between the Patent and Players\" was published during the late summer that attacked the actors. It claimed that \"all Men of Sense and Integrity seem to be entirely convinced that the \"Patentees\" of the \"Theatre-Royal\" in \"Drury-Lane\", have had great Injustice done them by the late Attempt of Part of their own Company to defraud them of their Property\". The actors responded in an article published in the \"Daily Journal\" of 26 September. Also during the summer, Edward Phillips produced \"The Stage-Mutineers\", a play that started on 27 July and ran for twelve nights. The play made fun of actors, writers, and the management as a whole. Even though it was attacked in the \"Grub-Street Journal\" of 9 August, theatre historian Robert Hume described the play as \"harmless stuff\". Regardless, Fielding was personally mocked as Crambo, one of the characters within the play, and was offended by the portrayal.\n\nThe Theatre Royal reopened on 24 September 1733 with a new company of actors. The majority of the rebellious actors joined the Little Theatre in Haymarket and started producing plays on 26 September. Although the Theatre Royal had replacement actors of a lesser talent and a few loyal experienced members, Henry Fielding joined the management's side of the dispute. Of the 15 loyal actors that stayed with the Theatre Royal, only a few, including Kitty Clive, Christiana Horton, William Mullart, and Charles Stoppelaer, were of note. Reportedly, Highmore was losing 50–60 pounds a week. Victor, in his account of the time, wrote:\nIn this maimed Condition the Business of Course went lamely on; for a very middling Company of Players could be expected to bring but thin losing Audiences, especially while Party prevailed, and those very Plays were acted much better in the \"Haymarket\". The unavoidable and melancholy Consequence of this Proceeding was, that there was a Ballance every \"Saturday\" Morning in the Office against the Manager, of Fifty or Sixty Pounds; and his Pride, as well as his Honour, were too nearly concerned not to prudence the Deficiency every Week with the utmost Exactness.\nIn such conditions, Giffard sold his shares and turned over full control of the theatre to Highmore. Hill was brought in to work with the actors at Drury Lane by Autumn 1733, but the theatre was still declining by the end of the year.\nIn order to aid the theatre, Fielding revised his \"The Author's Farce\" and \"The Intriguing Chambermaid\". Fielding's \"The Miser\" was also put on 27 October 1733 with the King, the Queen, and many noble families in attendance. After this, Fielding produced \"The Universal Gallant: or, The Different Husbands\", which didn't run until February 1735. 20th-century theatre scholar Charles Woods believed that Fielding joined with the management of the Theatre Royal because they were \"people whose legitimate investments were being jeopardized\". Fielding later attacked Theophilus in a revised version of his \"The Author's Farce\" which ran on 15 January 1734. This caused a backlash upon him after the rebelling actors finally won in the dispute, and it was harder for him to stage plays.\n\nTheophilus, through his father, applied to the Lord Chamberlain during the summer asking to have a new license issued, but he was refused. Following this, he applied to Charles Lee, the Master of the Revels, and received a license to perform theatrical shows in return for payment even though the license had no legal authority. This brought about criticism against Lee in the \"Daily Post\" dated 29 September 1733 over issuing the licence and called it just a ploy by the actors. On 30 October, the management of the Theatre Royal sent a letter to veteran actor John Mills and other rebels threatening further legal action regarding their unlicensed theatre. After Theophilus responded with a claim that he was acting within the law, the management and John Rich, manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, demanded the courts to shut down the unlicensed theatres. A 5 November hearing set a date for a trial, but the case fell apart before it was ever heard over the technical wording of a law that conflicted with the original request by the licensed theatre managers.\n\nA trial, in which the rebellious actors sued the management at the King's Bench over the management's occupation of the building that the actors controlled the lease, was held on 12 November. The judgment under Chief Justice Philip Yorke was in favour of the actors, and they were to be granted control of the theatre building in March 1734. Highmore, in response, asked for a charge against John Harper, one of the rebellious actors, for being a vagrant, and Harper was sent to Bridewell Palace prison. This provoked a negative reaction by the public, and the action was attacked in the \"Daily Post\" of 16 November. Eventually, a writ of \"habeas corpus\" was issued on 20 November and he was released without a case tried against him. Having no other recourse, Highmore began to negotiate the sale of the theatre license. Charles Fleetwood purchased both Highmore and Wilks's portions of the license on 24 January 1734. On 2 February, the \"Daily Courant\" announced that Fleetwood asked for the rebellious actors to return. An agreement was reached for higher wages and promotion of Theophilus to a deputy manager of the theatre. The actors took control of the Theatre Royal on 8 March 1734, marking the end of the rebellion.\n\n"}

She made her name on the stage in her native city, Liverpool, and later became a star of the London theatre, both in burlesque and comic plays.\n\nGoodall was born in Liverpool. By 1865, she was a star at the city's Theatre Royal, Williamson Square. In February 1865 she was granted a benefit performance in which she acted and sang. Works played on that occasion included Dion Boucicault's burletta \"A Lover by Proxy\". She also starred in productions in other Liverpool theatres at about this time. The author and journalist William Henry Rideing reminisced in 1912 about his boyhood in Liverpool, where he remembered Goodall as the reigning soubrette: \"Then the orchestra would tune up and Miss Goodall, smiling and bowing, would open the most beautiful mouth in the world ... It bowled me over.\"\n\nShe made her London debut in April 1865 at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in J P Wooler's \"The Winning Hazard\", attracting favourable reviews from \"The Era\", London's leading theatre journal, and \"The Daily News.\" In July of the same year, also at the Prince of Wales's, she made a success as a comic Lancastrian housemaid in a new farce, \"The Mudborough Election.\" In December 1865 she was cast in pantomime in \"King Chess\" at the New Surrey Theatre.\n\nOver the next two years she continued to establish herself as a leading West End player in comic plays and burlesques. In 1866 she was cast as one of two \"squabbling schoolgirls intent on marriage\" in H. J. Byron's \"One Hundred Thousand Pounds\". Her subsequent performances in this period included Byron's classical burlesque, \"Pandora's Box\", \"Magic Toys\" at the Prince of Wales's with Marie Wilton, \"La Vivandière\" by W. S. Gilbert and the farces, \"Mr and Mrs White\" and \"The Rendezvous\". In pantomime she was \"a very dashing and prepossessing Princess Eglantine\" in a version of \"Valentine and Orson\" for the 1867 Christmas season, and she successfully took a \"travesti\" (male) role in Boucicault's \"The Flying Scud\" at the Holborn Theatre, playing Lord Woodbie, followed by another trousers role, the valet Max, in Gilbert's burlesque, \"The Merry Zingara\", a parody of \"The Bohemian Girl\".\n\nIn 1868 she joined the company of the Strand Theatre in the burlesque \"The Field of the Cloth of Gold\" and appeared with the company mainly in London but also on tour during the next four years. In 1870 she appeared as \"a spirited St Patrick\" in F. C. Burnand's \"Sir George and a Dragon\", in which her dancing was \"a marvellous tour de force – perhaps more vigorous than graceful, but her Irish jig is decidedly one of the most attractive features in the burlesque.\" During her time with the Strand company the repertoire mixed burlesques and straight plays, including comedies such as \"Up in the World\", by Arthur Sketchley, in which she appeared in 1871 as a riotous page-boy.\n\nShe was evidently not only a practitioner of the theatre but also a teacher. In November 1868, \"The Era\" reported, \"Miss Ada Arnold, a pupil of Miss Bella Goodall, made a successful debut at the Holborn Theatre on Saturday last in the burlesque of Lucrezia Borgia.\"\n\nShe died at Pentonville Road and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

Recognition of bitter taste and aversion to it are thought to protect the organism against the ingestion of poisonous food compounds, which are often bitter. Bitter taste receptors are expressed not only in the mouth but also in extraoral tissues. BitterDB database, available at http://bitterdb.agri.huji.ac.il/bitterdb/, includes over 670 compounds that were reported to taste bitter to humans. The compounds can be searched by name, chemical structure, similarity to other bitter compounds, association with a particular human bitter taste receptor, and so on. The database also contains information on mutations in bitter taste receptors that were shown to influence receptor activation by bitter compounds.\n\nBitterDB currently contains more than 670 compounds that were cited in the literature as bitter. For each compound, the database offers information regarding its molecular properties, references for the compound’s bitterness, including additional information about the bitterness category of the compound (e.g. a ‘bitter-sweet’ or ‘slightly bitter’ annotation), different compound identifiers (smiles, CAS registry number, IUPAC systematic name), an indication whether the compound is derived from a natural source or is synthetic, a link to the compound’s PubChem entry and different file formats for downloading (sdf, image, smiles).\nOver 200 bitter compounds have been experimentally linked to their corresponding human bitter taste receptors. For those compounds, BitterDB provides additional information, including links to the publications indicating these ligand–receptor interactions, the effective concentration for receptor activation and/or the EC50 value and links to the associated bitter taste receptors entries in the BitterDB.\n\nBitter compounds can be queried and browsed in different ways. For example, 'advanced search' option allows user to retrieve compounds that fit different criteria, such as a combination of specific physical properties or a combination of associated human bitter taste receptors.\nIn addition to the querying options the user can browse through a sort-able table with all the BitterDB compounds.\n\nIn addition, BitterDB contains data about the 25 known human bitter taste receptors. Several properties are displayed for each receptor. The bitter taste receptors can be searched using different criteria: name, known ligands and UniProt accession number. Using a table that presents all the bitter taste receptors and some information about them, the user can browse and also sort by various options, such as the number of bitter ligands associated with the receptor.\n\nBitterDB offers two additional features: a local BLAST service to determine the local similarity between a query sequence and the different human bitter taste receptors, and a global alignment of the 25 human bitter taste receptors. The alignment was generated using ClustalW2, and displays the secondary structure of each receptor, as predicted by the TOPCONS server.\n\nBitterDB offers an ‘upload’ option, by which the users are encouraged to submit information about bitter compounds. These data will be reviewed by the authors and uploaded to the database accordingly. The users can join the mailing list in order to receive database updates.\n\n\n"}

The founders, Washington Cucurto, Javier Barilaro, and Fernanda Laguna started Eloísa Cartonera in Buenos Aires in response to the 2001 economic crisis during which the Argentine peso plummeted to one third of its value. The tough economic conditions led to an increase in the number of cartoneros, people who make their living collecting and selling salvaged materials to recycling plants.\n\nCartonera books are made from cardboard bought from cartoneros at three to five times the price set by recycling plants. The cardboard is then used to create covers for short books of prose or poetry. Each book cover is hand painted and sold on the streets at the cost of production in order to increase access to literature. This method of publication has provided the opportunity for unknown authors to be published, as well as for renowned authors to reach a more diverse audience. Beyond selling affordable books, the cartoneras promote literacy and the democratization of literature through workshops and book fairs which bring the greater public in contact with literature. The cartonera publishers also involve the community in the process of book creation and distribution through a cooperative learning experience which pushes aside educational and socioeconomic divides among participants. The books are generally published in small editions of 100 or fewer; however, popular texts are kept in print or printed through neighboring cartoneras.\n\nAlthough the cartoneras publish books in print form, information about the publishing houses themselves is often available electronically through their webpages, blogs, and wikis, or through online newspaper stories, interviews, and journal articles. While digital mediums are often used to write about cartonera, the books themselves are art-objects steeped in the smells and smudges of tempera paint and rough scissor-cut edges. Some cartonera books are now being preserved, most notably through the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Cartonera Publishers library collection and database, but the majority of the editions continue to circulate (as they are intended to do) and will disintegrate within ten years due to acid in the cardboard. As with other digitized databases and guides, the list below includes some of the presently known cartoneras, a number which is always shifting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The original version was one of dozens of works displayed as large outdoor posters in Jerusalem in 2001.\n\nVariations of this artwork have been used as bumper stickers and elements in rock concerts.\n\n, a Polish graphic designer based in Warsaw, had his original work chosen by a jury to be one of several dozen images to be displayed as x outdoor posters as part of a touring exhibit sponsored by the Museum on the Seam in Jerusalem. The exhibit opened to the public in Jerusalem in 2001.\n\nHis original image consisted of the word COEXIST in all capital letters, with the C replaced by an oversized Muslim Crescent, the X replaced by an oversized Star of David, and the T replaced by an oversized Latin Cross.\n\nDuring the international 2005–2006 Vertigo Tour of the Irish rock band U2, the original version of the image played a key role. Shortly after playing \"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\", the group would play politically-themed songs. During the opening portion of \"Love and Peace or Else\", Bono wore a white headband bearing a handwritten version of the word. In some venues, including Mexico City, the word was displayed on large electronic signs.\n\nThe image and variations of it are used as automobile bumper stickers.\n\nThe bumper stickers first began to emerge in the United States in the early 2000s in partial response to the military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan which began after the events of September 11, 2001. The stickers signify the capability or desire of humans to live together in peace.\n\nOne common version of the bumper sticker spells \"COEXIST\" using an Islamic crescent moon for the \"C\", a peace sign for the \"O\", a combination of the male symbol and female symbol for the \"E\", a Star of David for the \"X\", a pentagram for the dot of the \"I\", a yin-yang symbol for the \"S\", and a Christian cross for the \"T\". This version, designed by Jerry Jaspar, is perhaps the most common version of the bumper sticker.\n\nThe prevalence of the COEXIST bumper stickers has been noted in the Bay Area region centered on San Francisco. Users of the bumper stickers are often not practicing adherents of religion. This has led to one academic, Mark Coppenger, of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary to criticize the use of the symbol by atheists and to also question the ability of the bumper sticker to affect a wider audience.\n\nIn 2005, Młodożeniec and U2 were unaware of each other. They were also unaware that a company in Indiana already filed for a trademark in the United States in 2003. At the time, as there was no official U2 merchandise carrying this image, U2 fans created their own. The Indiana company filed suit against companies like Cafepress in May 2005 in an effort to stop unauthorized merchandise sales. Młodożeniec's attorneys maintained that he owned the copyright to the image. Separately, The Museum on the Seam, which sponsored the competition in which the original image first appeared in public, claimed legal rights to the image.\n\nThe following table shows the individual characters of the more well-known versions, either as Unicode characters, icons, or descriptions.\n\n\nThe popularity of the bumper stickers has spawned several anti-Muslim responses, including one with the image of the crescent altered with the addition of explosives.\n\nThere are several anti-religious parodies, spelling out words such as 'Toxic', 'Fiction' and 'Contradict'.\n\nOther parodies include a Communist hammer and sickle for the \"E\" and a swastika for the \"X\", indicating the dangers inherent in all ideologies.\n\n\n"}

Through her interactions with Buffy and her friends, she comes to accept the existence of supernatural forces and helps Buffy fight against them. In the television series \"Angel\", Cordelia joins Angel, a heroic vampire with a soul, in forming a detective agency dedicated to stopping supernatural forces and helping the helpless. After Cordelia acquires the ability to see visions of those in need, she becomes a more compassionate and heroic character. In the middle of the third season, she becomes a love interest of the protagonist Angel. In the fourth season of \"Angel\", she appears to take on a villainous role before it is revealed that she is possessed by a malevolent deity; this storyline eventually leads to her death and subsequent exit from the series. The character makes further canonical appearances in the comic books \"Buffy Season Eight\" and \"\", in a dream flashback and as a spirit guide.\n\nCreated as a foil for \"Buffy\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s titular heroine, Cordelia was initially characterized as \"shallow\", \"vain\" and \"self-centered\", and was used in the series to create conflict for the other characters. The character went through changes as she gradually redeemed herself throughout the course of \"Buffy\" and \"Angel\", and has received attention in academic texts related to gender studies and social status.\n\nCordelia Chase first appears in the premiere episode of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", titled \"Welcome to the Hellmouth\". Introduced as a potential friend for Sunnydale High's newest student, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Cordelia reveals her true colors by cruelly mocking Willow (Alyson Hannigan), whom Buffy befriends instead. Ignorant of the supernatural, Cordelia shows up regularly throughout the first season of \"Buffy\" to insult and ridicule the other characters. She plays a larger role in the episode \"Out of Mind, Out of Sight\", in which she falls victim to a social outcast who wants revenge on popular students for ignoring her so much that she turned invisible. In the season finale, Cordelia helps Buffy and her friends battle vampires, finally coming to terms with the existence of supernatural forces. In season two, Cordelia becomes a more active ally to the \"Scooby Gang\" and begins a romantic relationship with Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon). In \"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\", dating someone of Xander's social status causes Cordelia's ostracism from her popular peers and she reluctantly breaks up with him. However, when Xander performs a love spell to pay her back for hurting him, Cordelia realises how much he cares about her and takes him back, rejecting her superficial friends in the process. In season three's \"Lovers Walk\", Cordelia is heartbroken to see Xander kissing Willow and ends their relationship. By the season three episode \"The Wish\", Cordelia slips back into her antagonistic persona from the first season, disassociating herself from the Scooby Gang altogether. In the episode \"The Prom\", she reveals that her house and her family's entire wealth has just been seized for tax fraud and both of her parents (never named or seen on-camera) are now in prison. Cordelia later attempts an unsuccessful relationship with Wesley (Alexis Denisof) and makes peace with Xander at the prom. In the season three finale, she rallies alongside Buffy and her friends at graduation against the demonic Mayor of Sunnydale (Harry Groener), where Cordelia slays her first vampire.\n\nAfter three seasons on \"Buffy\", Cordelia left the series to move over to star in \"Angel\", a spin-off series focusing on Buffy's vampire ex-lover Angel (David Boreanaz). The first season of \"Angel\" sees Cordelia move to Los Angeles, in the hopes of escaping her new-found poverty by becoming an actress. After Angel saves her life in the series pilot, Cordelia helps him found the supernatural detective agency Angel Investigations, working in an administrative position. She also becomes close to half-demon co-worker Doyle (Glenn Quinn), but their budding romance is ended by his death nine episodes into the series. Before dying in the episode \"Hero\", Doyle passes his ability to see people in distress over to Cordelia when he kisses her. Although she initially views the visions as a curse, in the season one finale, a demon causes Cordelia's visions to overwhelm her—causing her to experience worldwide pain—and upon her recovery she vows to help those in need. In season two's \"Reunion\", Cordelia and the other staff at Angel Investigations are fired by Angel, who is becoming increasingly obsessed with bringing down the evil law firm Wolfram & Hart. Cordelia joins Wesley and Charles Gunn (J. August Richards) in re-forming the agency on their own. Angel and Cordelia eventually reconcile in the episode \"Epiphany\". As her acting career continues to flounder, Cordelia is sucked into and made princess of a medieval hell dimension called Pylea in the season two episode \"Over the Rainbow\". When presented with the opportunity to pass her visions over to a champion named the Groosalugg (Mark Lutz), Cordelia refuses and returns to L.A. with her friends in the season two finale.\n\nIn season three's \"Birthday\", Cordelia learns from the demon Skip (David Denman) that her visions are slowly killing her because human beings are not strong enough to control them. To save her life, Cordelia accepts Skip's offer to alter history so that she never met Angel in L.A., instead landing her big break as an actress. However, even in this alternate timeline, Cordelia feels compelled to help others and eventually crosses paths with Angel again, who received the visions in her place and is now insane. Unable to let her friend suffer, Cordelia has Skip return the timeline to normal, and agrees to become half-demon, with new powers, in order to harbor the visions safely. This season also sees Angel become a father, with Cordelia stepping in to mother the infant Connor until he is kidnapped into a hell dimension in the episode \"Sleep Tight\", only to emerge as a disturbed teenager (Vincent Kartheiser) in \"The Price\". In the episode \"Waiting in the Wings\", Angel realizes he has romantic feelings for Cordelia, but is prevented from voicing them by the return of Groosalugg. Cordelia dates Groosalugg for the remainder of the season, but Groo notices she loves Angel instead and decides to leave. In the season finale, Cordelia arranges to meet Angel to confess her feelings, but is prevented from doing so by Skip, who informs her that she has become a higher being. Cordelia accepts her duty, and leaves Earth for another dimension. In season four, Cordelia feels trapped in her position as a higher being, and so in the episode \"The House Always Wins\" she returns to Earth in an amnesiac state. In \"Spin the Bottle\", her memories are returned via a spell, along with a vision of a mysterious Beast (Vladimir Kulich). Afterward, she admits to Angel the feelings she once had for him. As L.A. succumbs to the apocalypse in season four's \"Apocalypse, Nowish\", Cordelia begins to behave out-of-character; she seduces Connor, murders Lilah (Stephanie Romanov) in the episode \"Calvary\", commands the Beast in \"Salvage\", and magically battles former friend Willow to keep Angel from his soul in the episode \"Orpheus\". In season four's \"Players\", the team realize that the now pregnant Cordelia is possessed, so Cordelia takes the unstable Connor on the run with her so they may give birth to their supernatural offspring, Jasmine (Gina Torres). In \"Inside Out\", Skip explains that Jasmine is his master, and a higher being who possessed Cordelia before her returning to Earth, manipulating events to be born in a new body of her own.\n\nCordelia falls into a post-natal coma for the remainder of season four. Following an eleven-episode absence, Cordelia returns to \"Angel\" in season five, in the 100th episode \"You're Welcome\". Having apparently awoken from her coma, Cordelia reunites with Angel Investigations, who she discovers have taken over Wolfram & Hart since their defeat of Jasmine. She chastises Angel for accepting W&H's \"deal with the devil\", and reminds him of his true mission and higher calling. Together, they face and defeat their old enemy Lindsey McDonald (Christian Kane), who had been impersonating Doyle in an attempt to destroy Angel. In the episode's closing moments, Cordelia reiterates to Angel that she loves him and kisses him, shortly before he receives a phone call reporting that Cordelia died that morning in the hospital. When Angel turns around, Cordelia is gone. It is later revealed that this encounter—the Powers That Be repaying their debt to Cordelia—allowed Cordelia to pass one last vision over to Angel, giving him the knowledge he needs to bring down the Circle of the Black Thorn.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2004, Joss Whedon and Jeph Loeb developed a 4-minute pilot episode for \"Buffy the Animated Series\", which was set during the show's first season. Had the series been picked up by a network, it would have featured Cordelia (voiced by Charisma Carpenter) in more high-school adventures. Following a 2008 leak of the pilot to YouTube, Loeb expressed some hope that the series may be resurrected in some form.\n\nCordelia also appears in comic books and novels based on the \"Buffy\" and \"Angel\" television series. \"The Cordelia Collection, Vol. 1\" by Nancy Krulik is a novelization of the \"Buffy\" episodes \"Out of Mind, Out of Sight\", \"Some Assembly Required\" and \"Homecoming\". These episodes tell specific incidents in which Cordelia becomes targeted: by a scorned classmate, to become a zombie's bride and by hunters in a case of mistaken identity. She appears in numerous \"Angel\" novels as a member of Angel Investigations, but some feature Cordelia more prominently; in \"Not Forgotten\" she uncovers exploitation of child immigrants, while in \"Haunted\" she appears as a contestant on a supernatural-themed reality television show when she has a vision about another applicant. Cordelia appears in the majority of \"Angel\" comics, published by Dark Horse Comics during 2000–2002 and set between episodes of the television series. She appears less frequently in those by IDW Publishing between 2005 and 2011, mainly in stories set in and after the fifth season. Cordelia typically plays a minimal role in the Dark Horse \"Angel\" comics. However, issue seventeen was a \"Cordelia Special\", in which demonic items are stashed in Cordelia's apartment. In the \"Dark Horse Presents\" story \"Lovely dark and deep\", Cordelia lands a role as the star of a demonic movie. Cordelia appears in the IDW Publishing comic mini-series \"Angel: The Curse\", set after season five, in flashback scenes. She subsequently reappears in the mini-series \"Angel: Old Friends\", which sees Angel battle evil clones of his friends. Cordelia claims to be the genuine article, having returned from the dead, but Angel is unconvinced and kills her; his suspicions prove correct when her body immediately disintegrates like the other clones.\n\n\"\", a canonical comic book continuation of the television series plotted by Joss Whedon and written by Brian Lynch, features the characters of \"Angel\" and all of Los Angeles condemned to Hell after the events of the series finale \"Not Fade Away\". Cordelia does not appear until the twelfth issue, in which she acts as a guide to Angel in his dying moments; it is revealed she serves in some capacity as a higher power now. The character departs in issue thirteen. Cordelia also appears in a dream sequence within the twentieth issue of \"Buffy\"s canonical continuation, \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight\", titled \"After These Messages... We'll Be Right Back!\". Buffy dreams of when she was in her first year at Sunnydale High; Cordelia's physical appearance is based on the art style of Loeb and Whedon's unproduced \"Buffy\" animated series.\n\nCordelia was originally intended to serve as a dramatic foil to the series' main character Buffy Summers. Adapting the concept of the movie into a television series, Whedon decided to reinvent the character of Buffy. The shallow cheerleader of the 1992 \"Buffy\" film, as played by Kristy Swanson, had grown more mature and open-minded. Buffy now identified with the social outcasts, such as Willow and Xander. As a result, Cordelia Chase was created to embody the traits of that shallower Buffy. Despite portraying a shallow, valley girl stock character, actress Charisma Carpenter felt that Cordelia in early seasons was not \"one-dimensional\", nor was she \"as superficial as people thought\". At the same time, Carpenter was critical of her frequent role as the damsel in distress. \"Angel\" co-creator and executive producer David Greenwalt describes Cordelia in her \"Buffy\" years as \"a somewhat shallow, somewhat vain, somewhat self-centered but [a] lively and honest character who spoke her mind\". Indeed, even not when superhuman, she showed a lot of hardiness.\n\nCharisma Carpenter had originally planned to read for the role of Buffy, but was late for her audition and instead tried out for Cordelia. Carpenter, who had dressed casually for the role of Buffy—who she believed \"could really be herself\"—felt unprepared to read for Cordelia because she \"was definitely a character to dress for\". Although she had only fifteen minutes to prepare for the character, the producers were \"really responsive\" to Carpenter's audition, and she left feeling confident she had got the part. After Carpenter's audition, actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had been offered the role of Cordelia before Carpenter, was asked to come back and audition for the part of Buffy. Bianca Lawson originally won the role of Cordelia Chase, but turned it down due to other contractual obligations. Lawson would later be cast as vampire slayer Kendra in the show's second season. Carpenter, proud of her own character's growth across the two series, did not envy Gellar for winning the role of Buffy over her.\n\nCordelia's representation of an assertive modern woman and her character arc in \"Buffy\" has been commented on in several academic texts, particularly in gender studies, such as \"Praising Cordelia: Aggression and Adaptation Among Adolescent Girls\", or \"\". In the latter, Dr. Lorna Jowett of the University of Northampton describes Cordelia's initial place in the series where \"At first glance, Cordelia seems to have the 'normal life' Buffy often longs for. She is a familiar character from the teen drama: popular, a cheerleader, the center of cliques (power as status). Furthermore, Cordelia's exceptionalism is based on 'real' material privilege rather than supernatural power. She represents in more exaggerated form the unnamed white middle-class heterosexual qualities (read privilege) of the other characters (to the point that it becomes visible).\" Elizabeth Rambo notes how Cordelia's status is highlighted by her nickname, \"Queen C\", and Harmony's remark to her, \"Cordy, you reign.\" Cordelia functions recognizably as the typical female victim of horror, often screaming and running away, and this makes her a perfect contrast for other female characters.\"\n\n\"Praising Cordelia\" argues that both Buffy and Cordelia are representations of assertive and competitive young women, who \"represent two kinds of aggressive adolescent girls\". The article focuses on the competitive relationship between the characters. Buffy's initial friendship with Cordelia is compromised once Cordelia sees the attractive, socially competent Buffy as a threat to her. Even after Cordelia joins the Scooby Gang and becomes Buffy's friend, theirs is not a friendship of \"mutual support, warmth and intimacy\" but rather one of \"mutual antipathy\". The authors opine that Cordelia, unlike Buffy, is a \"representation of the archetypal 'feminine type'\", one who conforms to the \"pervasive stereotypes of femininity while, at the same time, dominating the other girls in the school\" and commanding the attention of the boys. Describing her character arc in \"Buffy\", Mary Alice Money views Cordelia as one of many transformed or redeemed \"Buffy\" characters, one who \"reveals a previously unexpected vulnerability that nullifies some of their less attractive traits.\" Jowett argues that Cordelia's assimilation within the main group is due largely to her relationship with main character Xander, and she is rendered sympathetic to the audience once they witness her rebuff the peer pressure from her old friends. She is further endeared to the viewer when Xander betrays her, because the scenes showing her pain are shown only to the viewer. After Cordelia is cheated on by Xander with Willow she chooses not to go back to him, and instead retains her autonomy.\n\nOthers such as Susanne Kord and Elisabeth Krimer note how Cordelia is also a subversive representation of feminine stereotypes, describing \"Although superficially, Cordelia conforms to the stereotype of the insensitive bitch\", what she actually does is \"offers her viewers the clandestine pleasures of female self-assertion\". One of Cordelia's strongest traits, her honesty, is also highlighted in \"Earshot\", where Buffy temporarily develops telepathic powers and can hear the thoughts of her friends, who avoid her to hide these thoughts. For Cordelia however, \"her thought processes and actual utterances are completely identical\" and because of this she embodies an \"antithesis of female self-sacrifice\" in these years but also \"the opposite of the kind of hypocrisy that is typically attributed to women\". Writer Jennifer Crusie interprets this as Cordelia's \"lack of depth\" becoming \"her strength\". She does not mean to argue that Cordelia is stupid however, pointing out \"Cordy's solipsism could easily be mistaken for stupidity, but it comes coupled with a keen intelligence and a fixity of purpose that makes her almost invincible.\" Jowett feels Cordelia's confidence is based in her wealth. Despite becoming more sympathetic as the series progressed, \"bitchiness enhances Cordelia's comic appeal\", as it offers viewers an opportunity to relish its honest truth-telling.\n\nIn early seasons of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", Cordelia was often used both as comic relief and occasionally for the damsel in distress plot device, which would require series' heroine Buffy to save her. Any concerns that she was simply one-dimensional were alleviated for the actress when writers developed the character through her relationships with Xander and later Wesley, which led Carpenter to become more convinced of her potential. In an article about the psychology of characters in \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", Steven C. Schlozman writes about how \"Cordelia is wealthy and, at first glance, superficial, appearing to care most about her own popularity. However, as the show progresses, we learn that her mother suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome and her father was prosecuted for income tax evasion. She is a reluctant participant, baffled at her own loyal feelings and bewildered at her attraction to the unpopular Xander.\" He goes on to describe how Cordelia, and \"all the characters of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" are particularly compelling for their depictions of important adolescent themes.\"\nDiscussing Cordelia's relationship with Xander, Carpenter says, \"A lot of Cordy's conflict, and a lot of who she is, comes out around Xander. Because she is in love with him in spite of herself, or in spite of him. I have my best moments with [Nicholas Brendon].\" However, her character's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; \"I wasn't sure how I felt about it, because I didn't want to lose my edge. I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is.\" Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, \"That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [try] not to lose her edge, her honesty.\" Carpenter claims that Cordelia's \"rough edges\" made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character. Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers let her do in her final \"Buffy\" appearance, \"Graduation Day, Part Two\".\n\nOver the course of her appearances in \"Angel\", Cordelia would develop enormously as a character. Describing this evolution, Carpenter comments, \"When I first started playing Cordelia, she wasn't nice. She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility. She's a team player, which was not the case in the beginning.\" Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing The road Cordelia has travelled, the journey she has taken up to now has been such a joy to play as an actress, because there have been so many chances to do so many different emotions. Heroic, vulnerable, just angry, possessed, funny – I get to be all those different things rolled into one. Getting this role, in hindsight... God I made a good decision, or they did. Cultural critic Jennifer Crusie points out how Cordelia was initially perfect for the transition to \"selfish, superficial Los Angeles\", which turned out to be her \"trial by fire\".\n\nExecutive producer David Greenwalt was very keen to acquire the character of Cordelia for the spin-off series, commenting, \"I desperately wanted her to come to \"Angel\" because Angel being dark and broody, we need a big bright smile.\" At the same time, Whedon felt her presence was sorely missed in the fourth season of \"Buffy\" where \"All of our characters got to the point where they were loving and hugging, and it was sort of like, where's Cordelia?\", leading him to introduce Spike (James Marsters) to the cast to accommodate her absence. Kelly A. Manners describes Cordelia as a \"rich gal whose family ended up losing everything to the IRS. So in episode one of \"Angel\", Cordelia showed up in LA trying to start a career as an actress because her family was in jail, actually.\" Crusie states that in mourning for Doyle Cordelia also begins \"finding within herself a new level of humanity\".\n\nGreenwalt discusses how Cordelia \"is sort of forced to become a deeper character\" when she starts to receive the visions of the suffering and helpless, \"She's sort of living with one foot in the world of 'I want to be an actress' and with another foot in the world of 'I want to save and help people, and I have a deeper purpose and mission.'\" Greenwalt felt that this development allowed Cordelia to develop from a \"vainglorious high schooler to someone who's almost like a superhero\"; this also provided Carpenter with the opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress. From the tenth episode, \"Parting Gifts\", Cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in the series while the introduction of Wesley also contributes some added comic relief to the series. It is from this episode Cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns the death of Doyle, whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him. The first-season finale saw Cordelia's visions inflict all the suffering of the human world upon her, and to effectively act this, Carpenter's acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation. The scene took over eight hours to film, and Carpenter was relieved when it was over. The experience saw Cordelia further resolve to help those in need, stating \"I saw the world and there's so much pain. We have to help them.\" Carpenter explains, \"Through the suffering of the world, and through her own experiences, she discovers what's important in life.\"\n\nCarpenter pleaded to the producers to let her cut her hair in the second season of \"Angel\", but they were dissatisfied with the darker tone and cut which created a \"dark edge of Cordelia\" which wasn't as \"warm and effervescent as she usually is\", so for the third season they wanted her to \"go shorter and blonder\". \"Angel\"'s third season demonstrates Cordelia's development into a fully-fledged heroine. The episode \"Birthday\" saw her being offered the chance to live a life where she never met Angel, but her inner desire to help others sees her sacrifice this life and her humanity to become a half-demon who can better withstand the visions she carries. In \"Billy\", Cordelia begins to train alongside Angel to become a better fighter and learns quickly. Carpenter began to train extensively with the show's stunt co-ordinators both to learn how to fight and to handle weaponry. In the episode \"Waiting in the Wings\", both Angel and Lorne remark on what a fine woman Cordelia has finally become, with Cordelia noting she is more like a superhero than she ever expected to be growing up in Sunnydale. Also in this episode, she and Angel both realize they have fallen for one another, but their love goes unconsummated. Critically, Jennifer Crusie considers Cordelia's ascension to the heavens at the end of season three to be the \"point that the Mutant Enemy Productions writers evidently lost their minds\". She goes on to describe how Cordelia's compliance with Skip seems entirely out of character. Jes Battis also argues that a paradox is created when \"the character who embraces her privilege (Cordelia) gets to become a higher being and exit \"Angel\", and as an overwhelmingly positive force\" where later Fred (Amy Acker), \"the character who is conflicted about her privilege\" in season five \"ends up being possessed by a millennia-old demon\".\n\n\"Angel\" season four played with audience's expectations of the now heroic Cordelia by revealing her to be the season's Big Bad; it was later established that Cordelia had been possessed by a manipulative deity called Jasmine. The storyline was controversial with fans, and Carpenter has admitted hating how a possessed Cordelia seduced Angel's teenage son. Carpenter has said, \"I'm in denial about that whole storyline. It was creepy.\" She tried to keep a positive attitude about the situation, though; director Terrence O'Hara commented that he thought Carpenter had \"a lot of fun\" playing a manipulative Cordelia in the episode \"Orpheus\" because she enjoyed coming up with Cordelia's new \"schizophrenic madwoman\" characterization. David Boreanaz was also unsettled by the incestuous pairing. At a 2004 convention he admitted that the season four storyline \"freaked him out.\" The episode \"Inside Out\" saw the height of this inversion of Cordelia's character, where she is seen urging Connor to murder an innocent girl in order to expedite the birth of the child they conceived together. In an effort to stop Connor, the Powers That Be send the spirit of Connor's mother Darla (Julie Benz) to convince him not to go through with it. The episode sees Carpenter dressed in black, while Benz appears in heavenly white as she becomes the voice of reason and morality. Steven S. DeKnight, who wrote and directed the episode, felt this was a brilliant role-reversal for both actresses as Carpenter is accustomed to playing the benevolent Cordelia where Darla is normally seen as a sinister vampire. Much of season four's storyline had to be adjusted due to Carpenter's real-life pregnancy; after Cordelia gives birth to Jasmine in the episode \"Inside Out\" she is left in a coma for the remainder of the fourth season. Crusie discusses what she felt were the flaws in the execution of the fourth season, It's that she betrays the man she trusts above all others and who trusts her absolutely; it's that she seduces a boy she once diapered; it's that she dresses like a drag queen and talks like a \"Dynasty\" reject. It's that she's not Cordy, and what might have been fun to watch had we been let into the secret before the Beastmaster seduced Connor becomes the extended rape and death of a much-beloved character.\n\nMatt Hills and Rebecca Williams also discuss the treatment of Cordelia (and Darla) in \"\"Angel\"'s Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'\", from \"\" by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters as part of a pattern of highly gendered \"elaborated abjection\" seen in \"Angel\". They also see Cordelia's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern: \"More so than other characters in [\"Buffy\"] and \"Angel\", Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally\" and recounts the demon impregnation in \"Expecting\", and similarly in \"Epiphany\", where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in \"Through the Looking Glass\". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her \"status as a violated and devalued character\"; Cordelia states, \"If you ever figure out how to get us out of here, I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with his spawn!\" They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in \"Inside Out\", to what Barbara Creed called the 'monstrous womb' in her book \"The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis\". Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to \"'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation\". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the \"real\" Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, \"and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma\". Further illustrating the comparisons, \"Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew.\" Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.\n\nFor \"Angel\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fifth season, as with \"Buffy\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fourth, Spike steps in to replace Cordelia as a source of comedic dialogue within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, \"it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not\". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in \"Angel\"'s fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the \"mission statement\" of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was \"there at the beginning\"—ask of Angel, \"Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and how do you feel about that?\" The return to the show's \"original concerns\" is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel \"You forgot who you are,\" bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since \"we couldn't get Sarah\" the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, \"This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic.\" In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because \"the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon,\" says Fury.\n\nFor her role as Cordelia Chase, as she appeared in the television series \"Angel\", Charisma Carpenter has been nominated four times by the Saturn Awards. Carpenter earned back-to-back nominations in 2000 and 2001 for Best Genre TV Supporting Actress and Best Actress on Television, respectively. The actress did not receive any nominations in 2002, but again obtained two back-to-back nominations in 2003 and 2004 for Best Actress in a Television Series and Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series, respectively.\n\n"}

He was born in Sladaja near Despotovac (Serbia) in 1947.He began doing sculpture in 1968. He died in Sladaja, near Despotovac (Serbia) in 2011.\n\nHis preoccupation with existential problems of farmers, highlanders, miners is visible in the structures of extraordinary expressive force, achieved by a specific manner of procession, more with forceful cuts in the wood by an axe than by a sculptor’s chisel. Led by a strong instinct and robust character, he processed the wood rustically, transmitting his raw energy into a wooden mass, emphasizing a predominant force of a man – highlander, who seizes from the nature in his fight for survival. In his sculptures with multiplied figures, central figures or events are rare. While doing sculpture Aleksić liberates a thought, not a tale, hence the intensity of expression is most pronounced in the mere procedure of cutting, quick and capricious, in order to make his idea visible as soon as possible. With deeper, abrupt, unexpected incision in wood he creates dynamic light effects in which the dance of light and shadow provides an additional dynamics to the whole work. He is an artist of action and instinct without pictorial deliberation. Therefore, his idea is raw, uncultivated, but direct, suggestive, sometimes schematically given but intensive and complete. From whole mass of monumental logs, heads and busts emerge, rarely whole human and animal figures and vegetation. In sculptural treatment, Dragutin Aleksić’s work has a touch of art brut, or more precisely, is on the borderline between naïve art and art brut.\n\nHe had his first exhibition in 1970 and he participated in individual and group shows in the country and abroad. The greatest collection of his sculptures is at Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art (MNMA), Jagodina, Serbia. He received many domestic and international awards for his work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "60125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60125", "title": "Engraving", "text": "Engraving\n\nEngraving is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it with a burin. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or glass are engraved, or may provide an intaglio printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called \"engravings\". Engraving is one of the oldest and most important techniques in printmaking. Wood engraving is a form of relief printing and is not covered in this article.\n\nEngraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper in artistic printmaking, in mapmaking, and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by various photographic processes in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by etching and other techniques.\n\n\"Engraving\" is also loosely but incorrectly used for any old black and white print; it requires a degree of expertise to distinguish engravings from prints using other techniques such as etching in particular, but also mezzotint and other techniques. Many old master prints also combine techniques on the same plate, further confusing matters. Line engraving and steel engraving cover use for reproductive prints, illustrations in books and magazines, and similar uses, mostly in the 19th century, and often not actually using engraving.\n\nTraditional engraving, by burin or with the use of machines, continues to be practised by goldsmiths, glass engravers, gunsmiths and others, while modern industrial techniques such as photoengraving and laser engraving have many important applications. Engraved gems were an important art in the ancient world, revived at the Renaissance, although the term traditionally covers relief as well as intaglio carvings, and is essentially a branch of sculpture rather than engraving, as drills were the usual tools.\n\nOther terms often used for printed engravings are copper engraving, copper-plate engraving or \"line engraving\". Steel engraving is the same technique, on steel or steel-faced plates, and was mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and reproductive prints, letterheads and similar uses from about 1790 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less popular, except for banknotes and other forms of security printing. Especially in the past, \"engraving\" was often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching or mezzotint. \"Hand engraving\" is a term sometimes used for engraving objects other than printing plates, to inscribe or decorate jewellery, firearms, trophies, knives and other fine metal goods. Traditional engravings in printmaking are also \"hand engraved\", using just the same techniques to make the lines in the plate.\n\nEach graver is different and has its own use. Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a burin, or graver, to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate. However, modern hand engraving artists use burins or gravers to cut a variety of metals such as silver, nickel, steel, brass, gold, titanium, and more, in applications from weaponry to jewellery to motorcycles to found objects. Modern professional engravers can engrave with a resolution of up to 40 lines per mm in high grade work creating game scenes and scrollwork. Dies used in mass production of molded parts are sometimes hand engraved to add special touches or certain information such as part numbers.\n\nIn addition to hand engraving, there are engraving machines that require less human finesse and are not directly controlled by hand. They are usually used for lettering, using a pantographic system. There are versions for the insides of rings and also the outsides of larger pieces. Such machines are commonly used for inscriptions on rings, lockets and presentation pieces.\n\nGravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do fill work on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for fill work on letters, as well as \"wriggle\" cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called bright-cut engraving), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. Square or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 degrees, depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulets and burnishers are used for texturing effects. Burnishing tools can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.\n\nMusical instrument engraving on American-made brass instruments flourished in the 1920s and utilizes a specialized engraving technique where a flat graver is \"walked\" across the surface of the instrument to make zig-zag lines and patterns. The method for \"walking\" the graver may also be referred to as \"wriggle\" or \"wiggle\" cuts. This technique is necessary due to the thinness of metal used to make musical instruments versus firearms or jewelry. Wriggle cuts are commonly found on silver Western jewelry and other Western metal work.\n\nTool geometry is extremely important for accuracy in hand engraving. When sharpened for most applications, a graver has a \"face\", which is the top of the graver, and a \"heel\", which is the bottom of the graver; not all tools or application require a heel. These two surfaces meet to form a point that cuts the metal. The geometry and length of the heel helps to guide the graver smoothly as it cuts the surface of the metal. When the tool's point breaks or chips, even on a microscopic level, the graver can become hard to control and produces unexpected results. Modern innovations have brought about new types of carbide that resist chipping and breakage, which hold a very sharp point longer between resharpening than traditional metal tools.\n\nSharpening a graver or burin requires either a sharpening stone or wheel. Harder carbide and steel gravers require diamond-grade sharpening wheels; these gravers can be polished to a mirror finish using a ceramic or cast iron lap, which is essential in creating bright cuts. Several low-speed, reversible sharpening system made specifically for hand engravers are available that reduce sharpening time. Fixtures that secure the tool in place at certain angles and geometries are also available to take the guesswork from sharpening to produce accurate points. Very few master engravers exist today who rely solely on \"feel\" and muscle memory to sharpen tools. These master engravers typically worked for many years as an apprentice, most often learning techniques decades before modern machinery was available for hand engravers. These engravers typically trained in such countries as Italy and Belgium, where hand engraving has a rich and long heritage of masters.\n\nDesign or artwork is generally prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers are able to draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior to engraving. The work to be engraved may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with inkjet or laser printouts, or stippled. Engraving artists may rely on hand drawing skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.\n\nOriginally, handpieces varied little in design as the common use was to push with the handle placed firmly in the center of the palm. With modern pneumatic engraving systems, handpieces are designed and created in a variety of shapes and power ranges. Handpieces are made using various methods and materials. Knobs may be handmade from wood, molded and engineered from plastic, or machine-made from brass, steel, or other metals. The most widely known hand engraving tool maker, GRS Tools in Kansas is an American-owned and operated company that manufacture handpieces as well as many other tools for various applications in metal engraving.\n\nThe actual engraving is traditionally done by a combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional \"hand push\" process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the \"hand push\" effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.\n\nHand engraving artists today employ a combination of hand push, pneumatic, rotary, or hammer and chisel methods. Hand push is still commonly used by modern hand engraving artists who create \"bulino\" style work, which is highly detailed and delicate, fine work; a great majority, if not all, traditional printmakers today rely solely upon hand push methods. Pneumatic systems greatly reduce the effort required for removing large amounts of metal, such as in deep relief engraving or Western bright cut techniques.\n\nFinishing the work is often necessary when working in metal that may rust or where a colored finish is desirable, such as a firearm. A variety of spray lacquers and finishing techniques exist to seal and protect the work from exposure to the elements and time. Finishing also may include lightly sanding the surface to remove small chips of metal called \"burrs\" that are very sharp and unsightly. Some engravers prefer high contrast to the work or design, using black paints or inks to darken removed (and lower) areas of exposed metal. The excess paint or ink is wiped away and allowed to dry before lacquering or sealing, which may or may not be desired by the artist.\n\nBecause of the high level of microscopic detail that can be achieved by a master engraver, counterfeiting of engraved designs is well-nigh impossible, and modern banknotes are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other security-sensitive papers. The engraving is so fine that a normal printer cannot recreate the detail of hand engraved images, nor can it be scanned. In the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, more than one hand engraver will work on the same plate, making it nearly impossible for one person to duplicate all the engraving on a particular banknote or document.\n\nThe modern discipline of hand engraving, as it is called in a metalworking context, survives largely in a few specialized fields. The highest levels of the art are found on firearms and other metal weaponry, jewellery, and musical instruments.\n\nIn most commercial markets today, hand engraving has been replaced with milling using CNC engraving or milling machines. Still, there are certain applications where use of hand engraving tools cannot be replaced.\n\nIn some instances, images or designs can be transferred to metal surfaces via mechanical process. One such process is roll stamping or roller-die engraving. In this process, a hardened image die is pressed against the destination surface using extreme pressure to impart the image. In the 1800s pistol cylinders were often decorated via this process to impart a continuous scene around its surface.\n\nEngraving machines such as the K500 (packaging) or K6 (publication) by Hell Gravure Systems use a diamond stylus to cut cells. Each cell creates one printing dot later in the process. A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8.000 cells per second to an accuracy of .1 µm and below. They are fully computer-controlled and the whole process of cylinder-making is fully automated.\n\nIt is now common place for retail stores (mostly jewellery, silverware or award stores) to have a small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail engraving machines tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator and the ability to do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the software will translate into digital signals telling the engraver machine what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time consuming.\n\nRetail engravers mainly use two different processes. The first and most common 'Diamond Drag' pushes the diamond cutter through the surface of the material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is 'Spindle Cutter'. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as it pushes it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond drag. It is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.\n\nWith state-of-the-art machinery it is easy to have a simple, single item complete in under ten minutes.\nThe engraving process with diamonds is state-of-the-art since the 1960s.\n\nToday laser engraving machines are in development but still mechanical cutting has proven its strength in economical terms and quality. More than 4,000 engravers make approx. 8 Mio printing cylinders worldwide per year.\n\n\"For the printing process, see intaglio (printmaking). For the Western art history of engraved prints, see old master print and line engraving\"\n\nThe first evidence for humans engraving patterns is a chiselled shell, dating back between 540,000 and 430,000 years, from Trinil, in Java, Indonesia, where the first Homo erectus was discovered. Hatched banding upon ostrich eggshells used as water containers found in South Africa in the Diepkloof Rock Shelter and dated to the Middle Stone Age around 60,000 BC are the next documented case of human engraving. Engraving on bone and ivory is an important technique for the Art of the Upper Paleolithic, and larger engraved petroglyphs on rocks are found from many prehistoric periods and cultures around the world.\n\nIn antiquity, the only engraving on metal that could be carried out is the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C. The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by chasing or sometimes a combination of lost-wax casting and chasing. Engraved gem is a term for any carved or engraved semi-precious stone; this was an important small-scale art form in the ancient world, and remained popular until the 19th century.\n\nHowever the use of glass engraving, usually using a wheel, to cut decorative scenes or figures into glass vessels, in imitation of hardstone carvings, appears as early as the first century AD, continuing into the fourth century CE at urban centers such as Cologne and Rome, and appears to have ceased sometime in the fifth century. Decoration was first based on Greek mythology, before hunting and circus scenes became popular, as well as imagery drawn from the Old and New Testament. It appears to have been used to mimic the appearance of precious metal wares during the same period, including the application of gold leaf, and could be cut free-hand or with lathes. As many as twenty separate stylistic workshops have been identified, and it seems likely that the engraver and vessel producer were separate craftsmen.\n\nIn the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as old master prints, in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as Martin Schongauer, Albrecht Dürer, and Lucas van Leiden.\nThereafter engraving tended to lose ground to etching, which was a much easier technique for the artist to learn. But many prints combined the two techniques: although Rembrandt's prints are generally all called etchings for convenience, many of them have some burin or drypoint work, and some have nothing else. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial illustration.\n\nBefore the advent of photography, engraving was used to reproduce other forms of art, for example paintings. Engravings continued to be common in newspapers and many books into the early 20th century, as they were cheaper to use in printing than photographic images.\n\nMany classic postage stamps were engraved, although the practice is now mostly confined to particular countries, or used when a more \"elegant\" design is desired and a limited color range is acceptable.\nModifying the relief designs on coins is a craft dating back to the 18th century and today modified coins are known colloquially as hobo nickels. In the United States, especially during the Great Depression, coin engraving on the large-faced Indian Head nickel became a way to help make ends meet. The craft continues today, and with modern equipment often produces stunning miniuture sculptural artworks and floral scrollwork.\n\nDuring the mid-20th century, a renaissance in hand-engraving began to take place. With the inventions of pneumatic hand-engraving systems that aided hand-engravers, the art and techniques of hand-engraving became more accessible. \n\nThe first music printed from engraved plates dates from 1446 and most printed music was produced through engraving from roughly 1700–1860. From 1860–1990 most printed music was produced through a combination of engraved master plates reproduced through offset lithography.\n\nThe first comprehensive account is given by Mme Delusse in her article \"Gravure en lettres, en géographie et en musique\" in Diderot's Encyclopedia. The technique involved a five-pointed raster to score staff lines, various punches in the shapes of notes and standard musical symbols, and various burins and scorers for lines and slurs. For correction, the plate was held on a bench by callipers, hit with a dot punch on the opposite side, and burnished to remove any signs of the defective work. The process involved intensive pre-planning of the layout, and many manuscript scores with engraver's planning marks survive from the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nBy 1837 pewter had replaced copper as a medium, and Berthiaud gives an account with an entire chapter devoted to music (\"Novel manuel complet de l'imprimeur en taille douce\", 1837). Printing from such plates required a separate inking to be carried out cold, and the printing press used less pressure. Generally, four pages of music were engraved on a single plate. Because music engraving houses trained engravers through years of apprenticeship, very little is known about the practice. Fewer than one dozen sets of tools survive in libraries and museums. By 1900 music engravers were established in several hundred cities in the world, but the art of storing plates was usually concentrated with publishers. Extensive bombing of Leipzig in 1944, the home of most German engraving and printing firms, destroyed roughly half the world's engraved music plates.\n\nExamples of contemporary uses for engraving include creating text on jewellery, such as pendants or on the inside of engagement- and wedding rings to include text such as the name of the partner, or adding a winner's name to a sports trophy. Another application of modern engraving is found in the printing industry. There, every day thousands of pages are mechanically engraved onto rotogravure cylinders, typically a steel base with a copper layer of about 0.1 mm in which the image is transferred. After engraving the image is protected with an approximately 6 µm chrome layer. Using this process the image will survive for over a million copies in high speed printing presses. Engraving machines such as GUN BOW (one of the leading engraving brands) are the best examples of hand engraving tools, although this type of machine is typically not used for fine hand engraving.\nSome schools throughout the world are renowned for their teaching of engraving, like the École Estienne in Paris.\n\nIn traditional engraving, which is a purely linear medium, the impression of half-tones was created by making many very thin parallel lines, a technique called hatching. When two sets of parallel-line \"hatchings\" intersected each other for higher density, the resulting pattern was known as \"cross-hatching\". Patterns of dots were also used in a technique called stippling, first used around 1505 by Giulio Campagnola. Claude Mellan was one of many 17th-century engravers with a very well-developed technique of using parallel lines of varying thickness (known as the \"swelling line\") to give subtle effects of tone (as was Goltzius) – see picture below. One famous example is his \"Sudarium of Saint Veronica\" (1649), an engraving of the face of Jesus made from a single spiraling line that starts at the tip of Jesus's nose.\n\nThe earliest allusion to engraving in the Bible may be the reference to Judah's seal ring (Ge 38:18), followed by (Ex 39.30). Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points. (Jer 17:1).\n\nEach of the two onyx stones on the shoulder-pieces of the high priest’s ephod was engraved with the names of six different tribes of Israel, and each of the 12 precious stones that adorned his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes. The holy sign of dedication, the shining gold plate on the high priest's turban, was engraved with the words: \"Holiness belongs to Adonai.\" Bezalel, along with Oholiab, was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train others.—Ex 35:30–35; 28:9–12; 39:6–14, 30.\n\nPrints:\n\nOf gems:\n\nOf guns:\n\nOf coins:\n\nOf postage stamps:\n\nOf pins:\n\n\n"}

In 2010, it was designed and made into a scale model by Julijonas Urbonas, a PhD candidate at the Royal College of Art in London. Urbonas, who has worked at an amusement park, stated that the goal of his concept roller coaster is to take lives \"with elegance and euphoria\". As for practical applications of his design, Urbonas mentioned \"euthanasia\" or \"execution\". John Allen, who served as president of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company, inspired Urbonas with his description of the \"ultimate\" roller coaster as one that \"sends out 24 people and they all come back dead\".\n\nThe concept design of the layout begins with a steep-angled lift to the (0.317 mile) top, which would take two minutes for the 24-passenger train to reach. Any passengers that wished to get off could then do so. From there, a drop would take the train to , close to its terminal velocity, before flattening out and speeding into the first of its seven slightly clothoid inversions. Each inversion would have a smaller diameter than the one before in order to maintain the lethal 10 g to passengers while the train loses speed. After a sharp right-hand turn the train would enter a straight, where unloading of corpses and loading of new passengers could take place.\n\nThe Euthanasia Coaster would kill its passengers through prolonged cerebral hypoxia, or insufficient supply of oxygen to the brain. The ride's seven inversions would inflict 10 g on its passengers for 60 seconds – causing g-force related symptoms starting with gray out through tunnel vision to black out and eventually g-LOC (g-force induced loss of consciousness). Subsequent inversions would serve as insurance against unintentional survival of particularly robust passengers.\n\nUrbonas's concept drew media attention when shown as part of the HUMAN+ display at the Science Gallery in Dublin from April through June 2011. The display, designated as its 2011 'flagship exhibition' by the Science Gallery, aims to show the future of humans and technology. Within this theme, the Euthanasia Coaster highlights the issues that come with life extension. The item was also displayed at HUMAN+ exhibit at Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona in 2015.\n\nIn 2013, Norwegian rock group Major Parkinson released \"Euthanasia Roller Coaster\", a digital single with lyrics alluding to Urbonas's Euthanasia Coaster.\n\nLavie Tidhar's short story \"Vladimir Chong Chooses to Die\" incorporates Urbonas's Euthanasia Coaster into the ending.\n\nGlenn Paton’s short film \"H Positive\" explores the motivations of a wealthy man who, upon discovering that he is dying, commissions an architect to build a Euthanasia Coaster identical to Urbonas's design. Although Urbonas is not mentioned during the film, the end credits affirm that the film was based on Urbonas's project.\n\n"}

The term was introduced by Franz Seiwert in 1929 using the phrase \"gegenständlichen constructive\", and this was subsequently taken up by Gerd Arntz and then by art historians more generally. It is closely related to the development of the Isotype. As Seiwert wrote \"From the expressionist-cubist art-form abstract constructivism was developed, which in turn led into Figurative Constructivism\".\n\nIn October 1929 Seiwert, Heinrich Hoerle and Walter Stern produced the first issue of \"A bis Z\", subtitled \"organ of the progressive artists group\".

The society publishes a journal, the \"Folk Art Messenger\" three times a year, and holds an annual conference that includes a symposium with speakers as well as visits to folk art museums and private art collections. Members of the organization include artists, collectors, academics, and curators, as well as libraries and other arts organizations.\n\nAnn and William Oppenhimer are considered the founders of the Folk Art Society of America and currently serve as the Executive Director and CFO respectively. Previously William served as the Chairman of the Executive Committee and Ann was the president of the organization. Before devoting her time to the Folk Art Society, Ann served on the art history faculty at the University of Richmond. As a member of the faculty she curated an exhibition of work from the acclaimed folk artist Howard Finster. The Oppenhimer's also have a significant folk art collection of their own, and their personal and professional interest served as a launch pad for activities of the society itself. Due to their initiative the society has, since its founding, produced its publication and held a conference every year. The regular publication of this magazine, as well as the maintenance of an updated website has led Ann Oppenhimer and the Folk Art Society to win numerous awards from the Virginia Professional Communicators.\n\nIn 2017, the Folk Art Society of America celebrates its 30th conference. The conferences are open to all who register. They include a symposium, a benefit art auction, studio tours, home tours, and museum visits. Local museums usually plan an exhibition to coincide with the occurrence of the Society's conference. At the conference the Society grants its annual Awards of Distinction, which are given to artists and scholars of folk art. A scholarship to attend the conference is given to a graduate student of folk art. In honor of one of the pioneers of folk art collecting, Herbert Hemphill Jr., a work of folk art is gifted to a museum or university, typically in the area the conference is being held. There is an annual auction that occurs at the conference to which members and folk artists submit artwork. Past locations of the conference include, Richmond 1988, Waverly (Va.) 1989, Washington 1990, Chicago 1991, Los Angeles 1992, New Orleans 1993, Santa Fe 1994, Atlanta 1995, Birmingham 1996, Milwaukee 1997, Houston 1998, Lexington/Morehead 1999, San Diego 2000, Richmond 2001, Savannah 2002, St. Louis 2003, Oakland 2004, Chicago 2005, Phoenix 2006, Louisville 2007, Washington 2008, St. Petersburg, Fla. 2009, Santa Fe 2010, Richmond 2011, Atlanta 2012, Raleigh 2013, Columbus 2014, Memphis 2015, and in 2016 St. Petersburg, Florida. In October 2017 the conference will be held in Santa Fe, the third time in this city.\n\nThe \"Folk Art Messenger\" is a journal that includes a variety of articles from writers on topics important to the folk art and self-taught art world including articles about folk artists, auctions, exhibitions, fairs, collectors and book reviews, as well as artists' obituaries. The magazine is known for its inclusive approach, focusing on the artists' struggles and successes, rather than hotly debated issues like what to call this type of art. Originally, the first \"Messenger\" was a black-and-white, 6-page fold out, but began to be published in color in 1997 with the 38th issue. Currently, the 40-page magazine carries no advertising and is the only American publication of its type published three time a year. The European counterpart to the \"Messenger,\" titled \"Raw Vision\", was first published in 1989. While the Folk Art Messenger focuses mainly on American artists, the two have much in common and previously referenced each other.\n\nA folk art environment is a large-scale work of art created by a folk or self-taught artist. These works are identified and recorded by Saving and Preserving Arts and Cultural Environments, a non profit arts organization. The Folk Art Society has awarded 12 plaques of recognition to various folk art environments. The plaque from FASA identifies the site as worthy of preservation and protection. Recipients of this plaque include the Watts Towers, Howard Finster's Paradise Garden, the Miles B. Carpenter Museum, and Grandma Prisbrey's Bottle Village.\n\nBottle Village, located in Simi Valley, Calif. was created by folk artist Tressa Prisbrey beginning in 1956. Following her death in 1988, the future of the village was uncertain. Many residents of the area found the site to be garish and wanted it demolished, however recognition from the Folk Art Society of America as well as the state's historic landmark program prevented its destruction after it was damaged in the Simi Valley earthquake in 1994.\n\nThe Folk Art Society was founded in Richmond, Va and held its first conference in the city as well. Although the organization strives to span the nation and now holds conferences throughout the US, the headquarters remain in Richmond since the founding except for a brief interlude. In 2014, the Society became a part of Longwood University, renamed the Folk Art Society of America at Longwood Center for the Visual Arts or FASA@LCVA. The FASA office and archives were moved to Farmville, Va for two years as a part of this transition. However this relationship was later discontinued and the Society returned to Richmond in March 2016. Currently the Society is in the process of turning its archives over to the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, Va., and will be working with Lee Shepard, the Vice President for Collections, in order to create a permanent archive that will be digitized and available for scholarly research.\n"}
{"id": "13676128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13676128", "title": "Folly Theatre", "text": "Folly Theatre\n\nThe Folly Theatre was a London theatre of the late 19th century, in William IV Street, near Charing Cross, in the City of Westminster. It was converted from the house of a religious order, and became a small theatre, with a capacity of 900 seated and standing. The theatre specialised in presenting music hall, burlesque and opera bouffe. The Beefsteak Club had quarters above the theatre.\n\nAs a stock company, under the direction first of Alexander Henderson and Lydia Thompson and then of John Lawrence Toole, the theatre was significant for beginning the professional careers of many Victorian era actors, writers and actor-managers. The theatre was demolished in 1895, possibly due to disturbance caused to the neighbouring Charing Cross Hospital.\n\nThe building opened as the \"Lowther Rooms\" in 1840. It was the residence of the \"Fathers of the London Oratory of St. Philip Neri\" from 1848–56 and was used for lectures. Here, in 1850, John Henry Newman delivered his \"Lectures on Anglican Difficulties\", after his conversion to Catholicism. On the departure of the religious order, which moved to the \"Brompton Oratory\", the hall became \"Woodin's Polygraphic Hall\" in 1855, where William S. Woodin gave monologue entertainments.\n\nIn 1869, the building was converted to a small Music hall and playhouse called the \"Royal Charing Cross Theatre\" and, in 1872 was renamed the Charing Cross Theatre and was advertised as the Theatre Royal, Charing Cross, in 1874-75. The theatre opened on 19 June 1869 with W. S. Gilbert's burlesque of \"Norma\", called \"The Pretty Druidess\", on the bill, and in 1870 it held Gilbert and Frederic Clay's \"The Gentleman in Black\". In 1872, it hosted J. S. Clarke's revival of Sheridan's \"The Rivals\", featuring Mrs Stirling in the role that was to make her famous as \"Mrs Malaprop\". The name \"Charing Cross Music Hall\" was also adopted in the late 1880s by the brothers Carlo and Giovanni Gatti for their \"Gatti's-Under-the-Arches Music hall\". This became the Hungerford Music Hall in 1883, later returning to the former name.\n\nAfter some rebuilding, by architect Thomas Verity, the theatre was renamed \"The Folly Theatre\" in 1876, when it was bought by Alexander Henderson, and it became a burlesque house, with his wife, Lydia Thompson, in the lead roles. The first piece was a successful burlesque of \"Blue Beard\". In 1877, \"Up the River, or the Strict Kew-Tea\", by H. B. Farnie and Robert Reece played at the theatre as did a Farnie and Reece adaptation of Offenbach called \"The Creole\".\n\nIn 1878, the theatre had a tremendous success with Violet Cameron in Robert Planquette's \"Les cloches de Corneville\", adapted by Farnie and Reece, which (after transferring to the Globe Theatre and returning to the Folly), held the record for long runs in musical theatre for a decade. Florence St. John got her start in the piece on tour and then in the theatre. Farnie and Reece's burlesque \"Stars and Garters\" then played. Reece's successful burlesque, \"Carmen; or Sold for a Song\", and Sydney Grundy's \"After Long Years\" both played at the theatre in 1879. T. W. Roberton's \"Dublin Bay\" played here in 1880. The theatre was described in \"Dickens Dictionary of London\" (1879) as \"A little bandbox of a place, very prettily fitted up, and with a decided speciality for burlesque and opera bouffe\".\nOn 7 November 1879, John Lawrence Toole (1830-1906) took over the management, with a stock company. Presentations included farces, burlesques and travesties of popular plays, beginning with H. J. Byron's \"A Fool and His Money\". Toole's only son, Frank, died on 7 December 1879 following an earlier football injury from which he never fully recovered. Toole was both a noted comedian and a friend of Charles Dickens. He spent much of the next few years touring, but also produced plays at the theatre, including Arthur Wing Pinero's \"Hester's Mystery\" (1880) and Byron's \"Upper Crust and Auntie\" (1880), Dion Boucicault's play, \"Dot\", starring Toole, was produced here in 1881.\n\nIn 1882, after further rebuilding, Toole re-opened the theatre as Toole's Theatre, becoming the first actor to have a West End theatre named after him. Noted actress Florence Farr (1860-1917) began her professional career with an apprenticeship at Toole's theatre, débuting with a juvenile role in Byron's \"Uncle Dick's Darling\", in 1882. In 1883, \"Stage Dora; or, Who Killed Cock Robin\", a burlesque by F. C. Burnand of Sardou's \"Fédora\", premiered at Toole's, starring Toole. Burnand's \"Paw Claudian\" (1884) was a burlesque of the 1883 costume (Byzantine) drama 'Claudian' by Henry Herman and W. G. Wills. \"Mr. Guffin’s Elopement\" and \"The Great Tay-Kin\", two shows with words by Arthur Law and music by George Grossmith, starring Toole, played at the theatre in 1885. The last play by John Maddison Morton to be produced in his lifetime, a three-act farcical comedy called \"Going It\", played at Toole's in 1885 and kept the house in a continual roar of laughter. Pinero's \"Girls and Boys\" played here in 1885, as did \"Billee Taylor\" in 1886 and \"The Butler\", by Herman Charles Merivale, starring Toole, also in 1886. \"Pepita\", an operetta by Charles Lecocq, premiered at the theatre in 1888. \"The Don\", by Merivale, also starred Toole in 1888.\n\n\"The Bungalow\", by Fred Horner, played at the theatre in 1890. \"Ibsen's Ghost\", a one-act parody on \"Ghosts\", starring Irene Vanbrugh and Toole, was J. M. Barrie's first London play, running for just 27 performances at Toole's Theatre from 30 May 1891. In 1892, Toole directed the première of Barrie's first hit play, \"Walker, London\", which ran for 497 performances.\n\nToole retired in 1893, due to increasing ill health, brought on by the deaths within a few years of his family. His last piece was \"Thoroughbred\" by Ralph Lumley, and upon his retirement Rutland Barrington replaced him in the role. The theatre was taken over by Violet Melnotte, who had made her début at the Folly Theatre in October 1876 as \"Fezz\" in \"Bluebeard\" with Lydia Thompson's Company. She had many interests and at the same time was building the Duke of York's Theatre, with her husband Frank Wyatt.\n\nThe lease expired in 1895 and plans were drawn up by C. J. Phipps to rebuild the theatre, but they were opposed, apparently because the noise at the theatre disturbed patients at the Charing Cross Hospital. The theatre was demolished in 1896 and the site used to extend Charing Cross Hospital. The site is now a part of the Charing Cross Police Station.\n"}
{"id": "37168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37168", "title": "Friday the 13th", "text": "Friday the 13th\n\nFriday the 13th is considered an unlucky day in Western superstition. It occurs when the 13th day of the month in the Gregorian calendar falls on a Friday, which happens at least once every year but can occur up to three times in the same year,for example in 2015, on 13 Feb, 13 March and 13 October. In 2017, it occurred twice, on 13 January and 13 October. In 2018, it also occurred twice, on 13 April and 13 July. There will be two Friday the 13ths every year until 2020; 2021 and 2022 will have just one occurrence each.\n\nA Friday the 13th occurs during any month that begins on a Sunday.\n\nThe fear of the number 13 has been given a scientific name: \"triskaidekaphobia\"; and on analogy to this the fear of Friday the 13th is called \"paraskevidekatriaphobia\", from the Greek words \"Paraskeví\" (Παρασκευή, meaning \"Friday\"), and \"dekatreís\" (δεκατρείς, meaning \"thirteen\").\n\nThe superstition surrounding this day may have arisen in the Middle Ages, \"originating from the story of Jesus' last supper and crucifixion\" in which there were 13 individuals present in the Upper Room on the 13th of Nisan Maundy Thursday, the night before his death on Good Friday. While there is evidence of both Friday and the number 13 being considered unlucky, there is no record of the two items being referred to as especially unlucky in conjunction before the 19th century.\n\nAn early documented reference in English occurs in Henry Sutherland Edwards' 1869 biography of Gioachino Rossini, who died on a Friday 13th:\nHe [Rossini] was surrounded to the last by admiring friends; and if it be true that, like so many Italians, he regarded Fridays as an unlucky day and thirteen as an unlucky number, it is remarkable that on Friday 13th of November he passed away.\nIt is possible that the publication in 1907 of Thomas W. Lawson's popular novel \"Friday, the Thirteenth\", contributed to disseminating the superstition. In the novel, an unscrupulous broker takes advantage of the superstition to create a Wall Street panic on a Friday the 13th.\n\nA suggested origin of the superstition—Friday, 13 October 1307, the date Philip IV of France arrested hundreds of the Knights Templar—may not have been formulated until the 20th century. It is mentioned in the 1955 Maurice Druon historical novel \"The Iron King\" (\"Le Roi de fer\"), John J. Robinson's 1989 work \"Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry\", Dan Brown's 2003 novel \"The Da Vinci Code\" and Steve Berry's \"The Templar Legacy\" (2006).\n\nIn Spanish-speaking countries, instead of Friday, Tuesday the 13th (\"martes trece\") is considered a day of bad luck.\n\nThe Greeks also consider Tuesday (and especially the 13th) an unlucky day. Tuesday is considered dominated by the influence of Ares, the god of war (\"Mars\" in Roman mythology). The fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade occurred on Tuesday, April 13, 1204, and the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans happened on Tuesday, 29 May 1453, events that strengthen the superstition about Tuesday. In addition, in Greek the name of the day is Triti (\"Τρίτη\") meaning the third (day of the week), adding weight to the superstition, since bad luck is said to \"come in threes\".\n\nTuesday the 13th occurs in a month that begins on a Thursday.\n\nIn Italian popular culture, Friday the 17th (and not the 13th) is considered a day of bad luck. The origin of this belief could be traced in the writing of number 17, in Roman numerals: XVII. By shuffling the digits of the number one can easily get the word VIXI (\"I have lived\", implying death in the present), an omen of bad luck. In fact, in Italy, 13 is generally considered a lucky number. However, due to Americanization, young people consider Friday the 13th unlucky as well.\n\nThe 2000 parody film \"Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth\" was released in Italy with the title \"Shriek – Hai impegni per venerdì 17?\" (\"Shriek – Do You Have Something to Do on Friday the 17th?\").\n\nFriday the 17th occurs on a month starting on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute in Asheville, North Carolina, an estimated 17 to 21 million people in the United States are affected by a fear of this day, making it the most feared day and date in history. Some people are so paralyzed by fear that they avoid their normal routines in doing business, taking flights or even getting out of bed. \"It's been estimated that [US]$800 or $900 million is lost in business on this day\". Despite this, representatives for both Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines (the latter now merged into United Airlines) have stated that their airlines do not suffer from any noticeable drop in travel on those Fridays.\n\nIn Finland, a consortium of governmental and nongovernmental organizations led by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health promotes the National Accident Day (\"kansallinen tapaturmapäivä\") to raise awareness about automotive safety, which always falls on a Friday the 13th. The event is coordinated by the Finnish Red Cross and has been held since 1995.\n\nA study in the \"British Medical Journal\", published in 1993, attracted some attention from popular science-literature, as it concluded that \"'the risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident \"may\" be increased by as much as 52 percent' on the 13th\"; however, the authors clearly state that \"the numbers of admissions from accidents are too small to allow meaningful analysis\". Subsequent studies have disproved any correlation between Friday the 13th and the rate of accidents.\n\nOn the contrary, the Dutch Centre for Insurance Statistics on 12 June 2008 stated that \"fewer accidents and reports of fire and theft occur when the 13th of the month falls on a Friday than on other Fridays, because people are preventatively more careful or just stay home. Statistically speaking, driving is slightly safer on Friday the 13th, at least in the Netherlands; in the last two years, Dutch insurers received reports of an average 7,800 traffic accidents each Friday; but the average figure when the 13th fell on a Friday was just 7,500.\"\n\nIn years which begin on the same day of the week and are of the same type (that is, whether they are a common year or leap year), Friday the 13th occurs in the same months.\n\nThis sequence, given here for 1900–2099, follows a 28-year cycle from 1 March 1900 to 28 February 2100. The months with a Friday the 13th are determined by the Dominical letter (G, F, GF, etc.) of the year. Any month that starts on a Sunday contains a Friday the 13th, and there is at least one Friday the 13th in every calendar year. There can be as many as three Friday the 13ths in a single calendar year; either in February, March and November in a common year starting on Thursday (such as 2009, 2015 or 2026) (D), or January, April and July in a leap year starting on Sunday (such as 2012) (AG).\n\nThe longest period that occurs without a Friday the 13th is 14 months, either from July to September the following year being a common year starting on Tuesday (F) (e.g. 2001/02, 2012/13 and 2018/19), or from August to October the following year being a leap year starting on Saturday (BA) (e.g. 1999/2000 and 2027/28).\n\nThe shortest period that occurs with a Friday the 13th is just one month, from February to March in a common year starting on Thursday (D) (e.g. 2009, 2015 and 2026).\n\nEach Gregorian 400-year cycle contains 146,097 days (with 97 leap days) or exactly 20,871 weeks. Therefore, each cycle contains the same pattern of days of the week and thus the same pattern of Fridays that are on the 13th. The 13th day of the month is slightly more likely to be a Friday than any other day of the week. On average, there is a Friday the 13th once every 212.35 days, whereas Thursday the 13th occurs only once every 213.59 days.\n\nIn the 2010s there were three Friday the 13ths in 2012 and 2015, and two in 2013, 2017 and 2018. There will also be two in 2019 and 2020. In the 2020s, there will be three F13's in 2026, and two in 2020, 2023, 2024, and 2029. The rest of years have at least one F13 if there are fewer than two or three in the 2010s and 2020s. Assuming nothing is changed with the calendar there are never more than three F13s in a year. There is a 28-year cycle that repeats when there is a F13 in February, March and November, and the current start of that pattern was in 2009. Although there is at least one F13 per calendar year, it can be as long as 14 months between two F13s. For the details see the table below.\n\nIn Finland one F13 is chosen as National Accident Day to raise awareness about automotive safety, this is possible because there is at least one F13 each year.\nThe table is for the Gregorian calendar and Jan/Feb for leap years.\n\n\n"}

The painting was completed in 1892 as an informal commission for the Musée du Luxembourg. Renoir painted three other variations of this composition in oil and two sketches, one in oil and one in pastel. Known by the artist as repetitions, they were executed to fulfill commissions from dealers and collectors. The work is on public display at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris.\n\nRenoir depicts two young girls at a piano in a bourgeois home, one in a white dress with blue sash seated playing and one in a pink dress standing. Renoir completed three additional versions of this composition in oil for collectors; the Luxembourg version is now housed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, the Robert Lehman Collection version is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, while the Caillebotte version and one other are in private collections. An oil sketch of the composition is on display at the Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris and a pastel sketch is in a private collection. The painting in the Musée d'Orsay is 116 cm high and 90 cm wide. The version at the Met is 111.8 x 86.4 cm. The oil sketch at the Musée de l'Orangerie is 116.0 x 81.0 cm.\n\nPissarro and Monet routinely painted series of variations on a single theme, but their works were intended to be shown together to chronicle the effects of light and atmosphere, while Renoir’s repetitions were independent essays in composition. In particular, details and poses changed subtly, and the sketches eliminate most of the background elements.\n\nRenoir explored a similar composition with his earlier 1888 work \"The Daughters of Catulle Mendès\", now in the Annenberg Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\n"}

The volume is considered a masterpiece of Romanesque book illumination of the 12th century.\n\nThe gospel book was made for the duke on commission at the Benedictine Helmarshausen Abbey. As for its date, the church in Brunswick was built in 1173, and the altar of the Virgin Mary was dedicated in 1188. The creation of the gospel book was formerly placed by most authorities at about 1175 (\"early dating\") but today the balance of opinion puts it at about 1188 (\"late dating\").\n\nThe manuscript, containing 266 pages with the text of the four gospels, 50 of them full page illustrations, was sold by auction on 6 December 1983 at Sotheby's in London for £8,140,000. The purchase price was raised, in the context of a German national initiative for the preservation of national treasures, by the German government, the \"Bundesländer\" of Lower Saxony and Bavaria, the Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz and private donors (largely from Brunswick). It was the most expensive book in the world until 1994, when Bill Gates bought the Codex Leicester, a manuscript by Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nThe gospel book, preserved completely intact, with 50 full page miniatures, is kept in the Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenbüttel, and for security reasons is displayed only once every two years.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12460", "title": "Green", "text": "Green\n\nGreen is the color between blue and yellow on the visible spectrum. It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495570 nm. In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage. Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald, which is colored green by its chromium content.\nDuring post-classical and early modern Europe, green was the color commonly associated with wealth, merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was reserved for the nobility. For this reason, the costume of the \"Mona Lisa\" by Leonardo da Vinci and the benches in the British House of Commons are green while those in the House of Lords are red. It also has a long historical tradition as the color of Ireland and of Gaelic culture. It is the historic color of Islam, representing the lush vegetation of Paradise. It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries.\nIn surveys made in American, European, and Islamic countries, green is the color most commonly associated with nature, life, health, youth, spring, hope and envy. In the European Union and the United States, green is also sometimes associated with toxicity and poor health, but in China and most of Asia, its associations are very positive, as the symbol of fertility and happiness. Because of its association with nature, it is the color of the environmental movement. Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the Green movement, some naming themselves Green parties. This has led to similar campaigns in advertising, as companies have sold green, or environmentally friendly, products. Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission; a green light means go ahead, a green card permits permanent residence in the United States.\n\nThe word \"green\" comes from the Middle English and Old English word \"grene\", which, like the German word \"grün\", has the same root as the words \"grass\" and \"grow\". It is from a Common Germanic \"*gronja-\", which is also reflected in Old Norse \"grænn\", Old High German \"gruoni\" (but unattested in East Germanic), ultimately from a PIE root \"*\" \"to grow\", and root-cognate with \"grass\" and \"to grow\".\nThe first recorded use of the word as a color term in Old English dates to ca. AD 700.\n\nLatin with \"viridis\" also has a genuine and widely used term for \"green\". Related to \"virere\" \"to grow\" and \"ver\" \"spring\", it gave rise to words in several Romance languages, French \"vert\", Italian \"verde\" (and English \"vert\", \"verdure\" etc.). Likewise the Slavic languages with \"zelenъ\". Ancient Greek also had a term for yellowish, pale green – χλωρός, \"chloros\" (cf. the color of chlorine), cognate with χλοερός \"verdant\" and χλόη \"the green of new growth\".\n\nThus, the languages mentioned above (Germanic, Romance, Slavic, Greek) have old terms for \"green\" which are derived from words for fresh, sprouting vegetation.\nHowever, comparative linguistics makes clear that these terms were coined independently, over the past few millennia, and there is no identifiable single Proto-Indo-European or word for \"green\". For example, the Slavic \"zelenъ\" is cognate with Sanskrit \"hari\" \"yellow, ochre, golden\".\nThe Turkic languages also have \"jašɨl\" \"green\" or \"yellowish green\", compared to a Mongolian word for \"meadow\".\n\nIn some languages, including old Chinese, Thai, old Japanese, and Vietnamese, the same word can mean either blue or green. The Chinese character 青 (pronounced \"qīng\" in Mandarin, \"ao\" in Japanese, and \"thanh\" in Sino-Vietnamese) has a meaning that covers both blue and green; blue and green are traditionally considered shades of \"青\". In more contemporary terms, they are 藍 (\"lán\", in Mandarin) and 綠 (\"lǜ\", in Mandarin) respectively. Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green, 緑 (\"midori\", which is derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb \"midoru\" \"to be in leaf, to flourish\" in reference to trees) and グリーン (\"guriin\", which is derived from the English word \"green\"). However, in Japan, although the traffic lights have the same colors as other countries have, the green light is described using the same word as for blue, \"aoi\", because green is considered a shade of aoi; similarly, green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples, green \"shiso\" (as opposed to red apples and red shiso) will be described with the word \"aoi\". Vietnamese uses a single word for both blue and green, \"xanh\", with variants such as \"xanh da trời\" (azure, lit. \"sky blue\"), \"lam\" (blue), and \"lục\" (green; also \"xanh lá cây\", lit. \"leaf green\").\n\n\"Green\" in modern European languages corresponds to about 520–570 nm, but many historical and non-European languages make other choices, e.g. using a term for the range of ca. 450–530 nm (\"blue/green\") and another for ca. 530–590 nm (\"green/yellow\"). In the comparative study of color terms in the world's languages, green is only found as a separate category in languages with the fully developed range of six colors (white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue), or more rarely in systems with five colors (white, red, yellow, green, and black/blue). (See distinction of green from blue) These languages have introduced supplementary vocabulary to denote \"green\", but these terms are recognizable as recent adoptions that are not in origin color terms (much like the English adjective orange being in origin not a color term but the name of a fruit). Thus, the Thai word เขียว \"kheīyw\", besides meaning \"green\", also means \"rank\" and \"smelly\" and holds other unpleasant associations.\n\nThe Celtic languages had a term for \"blue/green/grey\", Proto-Celtic \"*glasto-\", which gave rise to Old Irish \"glas\" \"green, grey\" and to Welsh \"glas\" \"blue\". This word is cognate with the Ancient Greek γλαυκός \"bluish green\", contrasting with χλωρός \"yellowish green\" discussed above.\n\nIn modern Japanese, the term for green is 緑, while the old term for \"blue/green\", now means \"blue\". But in certain contexts, green is still conventionally referred to as 青, as in and , reflecting the absence of blue-green distinction in old Japanese (more accurately, the traditional Japanese color terminology grouped some shades of green with blue, and others with yellow tones).\n\nThe Persian language is traditionally lacking a black/blue/green distinction. The Persian word سبز \"sabz\" can mean \"green\", \"black\", or \"dark\". Thus, Persian erotic poetry, dark-skinned women are addressed as \"sabz-eh\", as in phrases like سبز گندم گون \"sabz-eh-gandom-gun\" (literally \"\"dark\" wheat colored\") or سبز مليح \"sabz-eh-malih\" (\"a \"dark\" beauty\"). Similarly, in Sudanese Arabic, dark-skinned people are described as أخضر \"akhḍar\", the term which in Standard Arabic stands unambiguously for \"green\".\n\nIn optics, the perception of green is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 495570nm. The sensitivity of the dark-adapted human eye is greatest at about 507nm, a blue-green color, while the light-adapted eye is most sensitive about 555nm, a yellow-green; these are the peak locations of the rod and cone (scotopic and photopic, respectively) luminosity functions.\n\nThe perception of greenness (in opposition to redness forming one of the opponent mechanisms in human color vision) is evoked by light which triggers the medium-wavelength \"M\" cone cells in the eye more than the long-wavelength \"L\" cones. Light which triggers this greenness response more than the yellowness or blueness of the other color opponent mechanism is called green. A green light source typically has a spectral power distribution dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 487570 nm.\n\nHuman eyes have color receptors known as cone cells, of which there are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, which can cause color blindness, including the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green, known as deuteranopia or redgreen color blindness. Green is restful to the eye. Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue.\n\nIn the subtractive color system, used in painting and color printing, green is created by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model, used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors. On the HSV color wheel, also known as the , the complement of green is magenta; that is, a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light (one of the purples). On a traditional color wheel, based on subtractive color, the complementary color to green is considered to be red.\n\nIn additive color devices such as computer displays and televisions, one of the primary light sources is typically a narrow-spectrum yellowish-green of dominant wavelength ~550nm; this \"green\" primary is combined with an orangish-red \"red\" primary and a purplish-blue \"blue\" primary to produce any color in betweenthe RGB color model. A unique green (green appearing neither yellowish nor bluish) is produced on such a device by mixing light from the green primary with some light from the blue primary.\n\nLasers emitting in the green part of the spectrum are widely available to the general public in a wide range of output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared laser diode at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064 nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm (\"green\"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501 nm to 543 nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium–neon laser (543nm), the Argon-ion laser (514nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521nm and 531nm), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control.\n\nAs of mid-2011, direct green laser diodes at 510nm and 500nm have become generally available, although the price remains relatively prohibitive for widespread public use. The efficiency of these lasers (peak 3%) compared to that of DPSS green lasers (peak 35%) may also be limiting adoption of the diodes to niche uses.\n\nMany minerals provide pigments which have been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries. Pigments, in this case, are minerals which reflect the color green, rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities. The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all. Among the more notable green minerals, however is the emerald, which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Chromium(III) oxide (CrO), is called chrome green, also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment. For many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors, the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Copper is the source of the green color in malachite pigments, chemically known as basic copper(II) carbonate.\n\nVerdigris is made by placing a plate or blade of copper, brass or bronze, slightly warmed, into a vat of fermenting wine, leaving it there for several weeks, and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal. The process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by Pliny. It was used by the Romans in the murals of Pompeii, and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century AD. It produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate, but it had drawbacks; it was unstable, it could not resist dampness, it did not mix well with other colors, it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact., and it was toxic. Leonardo da Vinci, in his treatise on painting, warned artists not to use it. It was widely used in miniature paintings in Europe and Persia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its use largely ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green. Viridian, also called chrome green, is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate, was patented in 1859. It became popular with painters, since, unlike other synthetic greens, it was stable and not toxic. Vincent van Gogh used it, along with Prussian blue, to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting Cafe terrace at night.\n\nGreen earth is a natural pigment used since the time of the Roman Empire. It is composed of clay colored by iron oxide, magnesium, aluminum silicate, or potassium. Large deposits were found in the South of France near Nice, and in Italy around Verona, on Cyprus, and in Bohemia. The clay was crushed, washed to remove impurities, then powdered. It was sometimes called Green of Verona.\n\nMixtures of oxidized cobalt and zinc were also used to create green paints as early as the 18th century.\n\nCobalt green, sometimes known as Rinman's green or zinc green, is a translucent green pigment made by heating a mixture of cobalt (II) oxide and zinc oxide. Sven Rinman, a Swedish chemist, discovered this compound in 1780.\nGreen chrome oxide was a new synthetic green created by a chemist named Pannetier in Paris in about 1835. Emerald green was a synthetic deep green made in the 19th century by hydrating chrome oxide. It was also known as Guignet green.\n\nThere is no natural source for green food colorings which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Chlorophyll, the E numbers E140 and E141, is the most common green chemical found in nature, and only allowed in certain medicines and cosmetic materials. Quinoline Yellow (E104) is a commonly used coloring in the United Kingdom but is banned in Australia, Japan, Norway and the United States. Green S (E142) is prohibited in many countries, for it is known to cause hyperactivity, asthma, urticaria, and insomnia.\n\nTo create green sparks, fireworks use barium salts, such as barium chlorate, barium nitrate crystals, or barium chloride, also used for green fireplace logs. Copper salts typically burn blue, but cupric chloride (also known as \"campfire blue\") can also produce green flames. Green pyrotechnic flares can use a mix ratio 75:25 of boron and potassium nitrate. Smoke can be turned green by a mixture: solvent yellow 33, solvent green 3, lactose, magnesium carbonate plus sodium carbonate added to potassium chlorate.\n\nGreen is common in nature, as many plants are green because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll, which is involved in photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light (red) and short wavelengths of light (blue) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye, so light reflected by plants is enriched in green. Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis. Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin. The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.\nAnimals typically use the color green as camouflage, blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment. Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and ceruloplasmin, a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.\n\nThe green huntsman spider is green due to the presence of bilin pigments in the spider's hemolymph (circulatory system fluids) and tissue fluids. It hunts insects in green vegetation, where it is well camouflaged.\n\nThere is no green pigment in green eyes; like the color of blue eyes, it is an optical illusion; its appearance is caused by the combination of an amber or light brown pigmentation of the stroma, given by a low or moderate concentration of melanin, with the blue tone imparted by the Rayleigh scattering of the reflected light. Green eyes are most common in Northern and Central Europe. They can also be found in Southern Europe, West Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia. In Iceland, 89% of women and 87% of men have either blue or green eye color. A study of Icelandic and Dutch adults found green eyes to be much more prevalent in women than in men. Among European Americans, green eyes are most common among those of recent Celtic and Germanic ancestry, about 16%.\n\nNeolithic cave paintings do not have traces of green pigments, but neolithic peoples in northern Europe did make a green dye for clothing, made from the leaves of the birch tree. It was of very poor quality, more brown than green. Ceramics from ancient Mesopotamia show people wearing vivid green costumes, but it is not known how the colors were produced.\n\nIn Ancient Egypt, green was the symbol of regeneration and rebirth, and of the crops made possible by the annual flooding of the Nile. For painting on the walls of tombs or on papyrus, Egyptian artists used finely ground malachite, mined in the west Sinai and the eastern desert; a paintbox with malachite pigment was found inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun. They also used less expensive green earth pigment, or mixed yellow ochre and blue azurite. To dye fabrics green, they first colored them yellow with dye made from saffron and then soaked them in blue dye from the roots of the woad plant.\n\nFor the ancient Egyptians, green had very positive associations. The hieroglyph for green represented a growing papyrus sprout, showing the close connection between green, vegetation, vigor and growth. In wall paintings, the ruler of the underworld, Osiris, was typically portrayed with a green face, because green was the symbol of good health and rebirth. Palettes of green facial makeup, made with malachite, were found in tombs. It was worn by both the living and the dead, particularly around the eyes, to protect them from evil. Tombs also often contained small green amulets in the shape of scarab beetles made of malachite, which would protect and give vigor to the deceased. It also symbolized the sea, which was called the \"Very Green.\"\n\nIn Ancient Greece, green and blue were sometimes considered the same color, and the same word sometimes described the color of the sea and the color of trees. The philosopher Democritus described two different greens: \"cloron\", or pale green, and \"prasinon\", or leek green. Aristotle considered that green was located midway between black, symbolizing the earth, and white, symbolizing water. However, green was not counted among the four classic colors of Greek painting – red, yellow, black and white – and is rarely found in Greek art.\n\nThe Romans had a greater appreciation for the color green; it was the color of Venus, the goddess of gardens, vegetables and vineyards. The Romans made a fine green earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Lyon, Vaison-la-Romaine, and other Roman cities. They also used the pigment verdigris, made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine. By the second century AD, the Romans were using green in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green.\n\nIn the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the color of clothing showed a person's social rank and profession. Red could only be worn by the nobility, brown and gray by peasants, and green by merchants, bankers and the gentry and their families. The Mona Lisa wears green in her portrait, as does the bride in the Arnolfini portrait by Jan van Eyck.\n\nUnfortunately for those who wanted or were required to wear green, there were no good vegetal green dyes which resisted washing and sunlight. Green dyes were made out of the fern, plantain, buckthorn berries, the juice of nettles and of leeks, the digitalis plant, the broom plant, the leaves of the fraxinus, or ash tree, and the bark of the alder tree, but they rapidly faded or changed color. Only in the 16th century was a good green dye produced, by first dyeing the cloth blue with woad, and then yellow with \"Reseda luteola\", also known as yellow-weed.\n\nThe pigments available to painters were more varied; monks in monasteries used verdigris, made by soaking copper in fermenting wine, to color medieval manuscripts. They also used finely-ground malachite, which made a luminous green. They used green earth colors for backgrounds.\n\nDuring the early Renaissance, painters such as Duccio di Buoninsegna learned to paint faces first with a green undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces a more realistic hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of the faces look green.\n\nThe 18th and 19th century brought the discovery and production of synthetic green pigments and dyes, which rapidly replaced the earlier mineral and vegetable pigments and dyes. These new dyes were more stable and brilliant than the vegetable dyes, but some contained high levels of arsenic, and were eventually banned.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th century, green was associated with the romantic movement in literature and art. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau celebrated the virtues of nature, The German poet and philosopher Goethe declared that green was the most restful color, suitable for decorating bedrooms. Painters such as John Constable and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot depicted the lush green of rural landscapes and forests. Green was contrasted to the smoky grays and blacks of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe second half of the 19th century saw the use of green in art to create specific emotions, not just to imitate nature. One of the first to make color the central element of his picture was the American artist James McNeil Whistler, who created a series of paintings called \"symphonies\" or \"noctures\" of color, including \"Symphony in gray and green; The Ocean\" between 1866 and 1872.\n\nThe late nineteenth century also brought the systematic study of color theory, and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other. These studies were avidly followed by artists such as Vincent van Gogh. Describing his painting, The \"Night Cafe\", to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: \"I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens.\"\n\nIn the 1980s green became a political symbol, the color of the Green Party in Germany and in many other European countries. It symbolized the environmental movement, and also a new politics of the left which rejected traditional socialism and communism. (See \"Politics\" section below.)\n\nGreen can communicate safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as the colors of international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 in front of the Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.\n\nGreen is the color most commonly associated in Europe and the U.S. with nature, vivacity and life.\nIt is the color of many environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace, and of the Green Parties in Europe. Many cities have designated a garden or park as a green space, and use green trash bins and containers. A green cross is commonly used to designate pharmacies in Europe.\n\nIn China, green is associated with the east, with sunrise, and with life and growth. In Thailand, the color green is considered auspicious for those born on a Wednesday day (light green for those born at night).\n\nGreen is the color most commonly associated in the U.S. and Europe with springtime, freshness, and hope. Green is often used to symbolize rebirth and renewal and immortality. In Ancient Egypt; the god Osiris, king of the underworld, was depicted as green-skinned. Green as the color of hope is connected with the color of springtime; hope represents the faith that things will improve after a period of difficulty, like the renewal of flowers and plants after the winter season.\n\nGreen the color most commonly associated in Europe and the U.S. with youth. It also often is used to describe anyone young, inexperienced, probably by the analogy to immature and unripe fruit. Examples include green cheese, a term for a fresh, unaged cheese, and greenhorn, an inexperienced person.\n\nSurveys also show that green is the color most associated with the calm, the agreeable, and tolerance. Red is associated with heat, blue with cold, and green with an agreeable temperature. Red is associated with dry, blue with wet, and green, in the middle, with dampness. Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, is the color of neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons. Blue and green together symbolize harmony and balance.\n\nGreen is often associated with jealousy and envy. The expression \"green-eyed monster\" was first used by William Shakespeare in Othello: \"it is the green-eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on.\" Shakespeare also used it in the Merchant of Venice, speaking of \"green-eyed jealousy.\"\n\nGreen today is not commonly associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It was the color of the serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.\n\nIn Persian and Sudanese poetry, dark-skinned women, called \"green\" women, were considered erotic. The Chinese term for cuckold is \"to wear a green hat.\" This was because in ancient China, prostitutes were called \"the family of the green lantern\" and a prostitute's family would wear a green headscarf.\n\nIn Victorian England, the color green was associated with homosexuality.\n\nIn legends, folk tales and films, fairies, dragons, monsters, and the devil are often shown as green.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the devil was usually shown as either red, black or green. Dragons were usually green, because they had the heads, claws and tails of reptiles.\n\nModern Chinese dragons are also often green, but unlike European dragons, they are benevolent; Chinese dragons traditionally symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, hurricane, and floods. The dragon is also a symbol of power, strength, and good luck. The Emperor of China usually used the dragon as a symbol of his imperial power and strength. The dragon dance is a popular feature of Chinese festivals.\n\nIn Irish folklore and English folklore, the color was sometimes was associated with witchcraft, and with faeries and spirits. The type of Irish fairy known as a leprechaun is commonly portrayed wearing a green suit, though before the 20th century he was usually described as wearing a red suit.\n\nIn theater and film, green was often connected with monsters and the inhuman. The earliest films of Frankenstein were in black and white, but in the poster for the 1935 version \"The Bride of Frankenstein\", the monster had a green face. Actor Bela Lugosi wore green-hued makeup for the role of Dracula in the 1927–1928 Broadway stage production.\n\nLike other common colors, green has several completely opposite associations. While it is the color most associated by Europeans and Americans with good health, it is also the color most often associated with toxicity and poison. There was a solid foundation for this association; in the nineteenth century several popular paints and pigments, notably verdigris, vert de Schweinfurt and vert de Paris, were highly toxic, containing copper or arsenic. The intoxicating drink absinthe was known as \"the green fairy\".\n\nA green tinge in the skin is sometimes associated with nausea and sickness. The expression 'green at the gills' means appearing sick. The color, when combined with gold, is sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In some Far East cultures the color green is used as a symbol of sickness or nausea.\n\nGreen in Europe and the United States is sometimes associated with status and prosperity. From the Middle Ages to the 19th century it was often worn by bankers, merchants country gentlemen and others who were wealthy but not members of the nobility. The benches in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, where the landed gentry sat, are colored green.\n\nIn the United States green was connected with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle the pictures on the front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.\n\nOne of the more notable uses of this meaning is found in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". The Emerald City in this story is a place where everyone wears tinted glasses that make everything appear green. According to the populist interpretation of the story, the city’s color is used by the author, L. Frank Baum, to illustrate the financial system of America in his day, as he lived in a time when America was debating the use of paper money versus gold.\n\n\nGreen is one of the three colors (along with red and black, or red and gold) of Pan-Africanism. Several African countries thus use the color on their flags, including Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Togo, Guinea, Benin, and Zimbabwe. The Pan-African colors are borrowed from the Ethiopian flag, one of the oldest independent African countries. Green on some African flags represents the natural richness of Africa.\n\nMany flags of the Islamic world are green, as the color is considered sacred in Islam (see below). The flag of Hamas, as well as the flag of Iran, is green, symbolizing their Islamist ideology. The 1977 flag of Libya consisted of a simple green field with no other characteristics. It was the only national flag in the world with just one color and no design, insignia, or other details. Some countries used green in their flags to represent their country's lush vegetation, as in the flag of Jamaica, and hope in the future, as in the flags of Portugal and Nigeria. The green cedar of Lebanon tree on the Flag of Lebanon officially represents steadiness and tolerance.\nGreen is a symbol of Ireland, which is often referred to as the \"Emerald Isle\". The color is particularly identified with the republican and nationalist traditions in modern times. It is used this way on the flag of the Republic of Ireland, in balance with white and the Protestant orange. Green is a strong trend in the Irish holiday St. Patrick's Day.\n\nThe first recorded green party was a political faction in Constantinople during the 6th century Byzantine Empire. which took its name from a popular chariot racing team. They were bitter opponents of the blue faction, which supported Emperor Justinian I and which had its own chariot racing team. In 532 AD rioting between the factions began after one race, which led to the massacre of green supporters and the destruction of much of the center of Constantinople. (See Nika Riots).\n\nGreen was the traditional color of Irish nationalism, beginning in the 17th century. The green harp flag, with a traditional gaelic harp, became the symbol of the movement. It was the banner of the Society of United Irishmen, which organized the Irish Rebellion of 1798, calling for Irish independence. The uprising was suppressed with great bloodshed by the British army. When Ireland achieved independence in 1922, green was incorporated into the national flag.\n\nIn the 1970s green became the color of the third biggest Swiss Federal Council political party, the Swiss People's Party SVP. The ideology is Swiss nationalism, national conservatism, right-wing populism, economic liberalism, agrarianism, isolationism, euroscepticism. The SVP was founded on September 22, 1971 and has 90,000 members.\n\nIn the 1980s green became the color of a number of new European political parties organized around an agenda of environmentalism. Green was chosen for its association with nature, health, and growth. The largest green party in Europe is Alliance '90/The Greens (German: Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) in Germany, which was formed in 1993 from the merger of the German Green Party, founded in West Germany in 1980, and Alliance 90, founded during the Revolution of 1989–1990 in East Germany. In the 2009 federal elections, the party won 11% of the votes and 68 out of 622 seats in the Bundestag.\n\nGreen parties in Europe have programs based on ecology, grassroots democracy, nonviolence, and social justice. Green parties are found in over one hundred countries, and most are members of the Global Green Network.\n\nGreenpeace is a non-governmental environmental organization which emerged from the anti-nuclear and peace movements in the 1970s. Its ship, the Rainbow Warrior, frequently tried to interfere with nuclear tests and whaling operations. The movement now has branches in forty countries.\n\nThe Australian Greens party was founded in 1992. In the 2010 federal election, the party received 13% of the vote (more than 1.6 million votes) in the Senate, a first for any Australian minor party.\n\nGreen is the color associated with Puerto Rico's Independence Party, the smallest of that country's three major political parties, which advocates Puerto Rican independence from the United States.\n\nGreen is the traditional color of Islam. According to tradition, the robe and banner of Muhammad were green, and according to the Koran (XVIII, 31 and LXXVI, 21) those fortunate enough to live in paradise wear green silk robes. Muhammad is quoted in a hadith as saying that \"water, greenery, and a beautiful face\" were three universally good things.\n\nAl-Khidr (\"The Green One\"), was an important Qur'anic figure who was said to have met and traveled with Moses. He was given that name because of his role as a diplomat and negotiator. Green was also considered to be the median color between light and obscurity.\n\nRoman Catholic and more traditional Protestant clergy wear green vestments at liturgical celebrations during Ordinary Time. In the Eastern Catholic Church, green is the color of Pentecost. Green is one of the Christmas colors as well, possibly dating back to pre-Christian times, when evergreens were worshiped for their ability to maintain their color through the winter season. Romans used green holly and evergreen as decorations for their winter solstice celebration called Saturnalia, which eventually evolved into a Christmas celebration. In Ireland and Scotland especially, green is used to represent Catholics, while orange is used to represent Protestantism. This is shown on the national flag of Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Joe\" series were later established non-canon (they set on Earth-91274). Some of the crossover series featuring both Hasbro and Marvel characters were \"The X-Men and the Micronauts\" (guest starring the X-Men) and \"New Avengers/Transformers\" (guest starring the New Avengers). Despite the licensing rights reverting to Hasbro, indirect references to \"Rom\" and \"Micronauts\" have occurred since.\n\nOn 2004, Dreamwave Productions published \"Transformers/G.I.

{"id": "3924629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3924629", "title": "Hologram trademark", "text": "Hologram trademark\n\nA hologram trademark is a non-conventional trademark where a hologram is used to perform the trademark function of uniquely identifying the commercial origin of products or services.\n\nIn recent times holograms have been increasingly used as trade marks in the marketplace. However, it has traditionally been difficult to protect holograms as trademarks through registration, as a hologram was not considered to be a 'trademark'. This issue was addressed by the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which broadened the legal definition of trademark to encompass \"any sign...capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings\" (article 15(1)).\n\nDespite the recognition which must be accorded to holograms trademarks in most countries in other fields of the art, the \"graphical representation\" of such marks sometimes constitutes a problem for trademark owners seeking to protect their marks, and different countries have different methods for dealing with this issue.\n\nIn Canada, hologram trademarks are generally not acceptable if they cannot be represented graphically or if they are regarded as more than one mark, see first external link.\n\nIn the European Union, Article 4 of \"Council Regulation (EC) No. 40-94\" of 20 December 1993 (\"signs of which a Community Trade Mark may consist\") relevantly states that any CTM may consist of \"any signs capable of being represented graphically...provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings\". In Sieckmann v German Patent Office (case C-273/00) the EcJ states that graphical representation, preferably means by images, lines or characters, and that the representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.\n\nThis definition generally encompasses only very simply structured holograms, and therefore an applicant for a CTM may use one photograph or some views to graphically represent their trade mark, see first external link.\n\nIn the United States, the trademark manual for examination requires under 1202.14 that a hologram used in varying forms does not function as a mark in the absence of evidence that consumers would perceive it as a trademark. See In re Upper Deck Co., 59 USPQ2d 1688 (TTAB 2001), where the Board held that a hologram used on trading cards in varying shapes, sizes, and positions did not function as a mark, because the record showed that other companies used holograms on trading cards and other products as anti-counterfeiting devices, and there was no evidence that the public would perceive applicant's hologram as an indicator of source. The Board noted that \"the common use of holograms for non-trademark purposes means that consumers would be less likely to perceive applicant's uses of holograms as trademarks.\" 59 USPQ2d at 1693. \nTherefore, in the absence of evidence of consumer recognition as a mark, the examining attorney should refuse registration on the ground that the hologram does not function as a mark, under §§1, 2 and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1052 and 1127. Generally, if a hologram has two or more views, the examining attorney should also refuse registration under §§1 and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051 and 1127, on the ground that the application seeks registration of more than one mark. In re Upper Deck, supra. See TMEP §807.01. \nProvided the applicant can demonstrate that the use of a hologram or moving image both serves as a mark and is not functional, an application for such a mark may be made to either register. That being said, Examining Attorneys are instructed to refuse an application for registration of a hologram if the applicant does not provide evidence of consumer recognition of the hologram as a mark. the applicant seeking registration of a hologram must submit a drawing of the mark that captures the dimensions thereof. Further, Examiners are instructed to refuse registration of any holograms that show two different images on the grounds that the application is seeking protection for two separate marks. Further, the application must include detailed written description of the mark. During publication the drawing pages for these marks are published and thereafter the drawing page is incorporated into the registration certificate which is made available at the USPTO as well as the USPTO website, see first external link.\n\n"}

A kommos occurs \"when the tension of the play rises to a climax of grief or horror or joy\". Examples include the final section (lines 908-1077) of Aeschylus' \"The Persians\" (472 BCE) in which Xerxes laments the defeat of his Persian army, the final appearance of Antigone in Sophocles' \"Antigone\" (c.442 BCE), the interaction between the chorus and Oedipus when he returns having blinded himself in Sophocles' \"Oedipus Rex\" (c.429 BCE), and the exchange between Orestes, Electra and the chorus immediately after Clytemnestra's murder in Euripides' \"Electra\" (c.410 BCE).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "444267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=444267", "title": "Legally Blonde", "text": "Legally Blonde\n\nLegally Blonde is a 2001 American comedy film based on Amanda Brown's novel of the same name. It was directed by Robert Luketic, scripted by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, and stars Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, Matthew Davis, Victor Garber, and Jennifer Coolidge. The film tells the story of Elle Woods, a sorority girl who attempts to win back her ex-boyfriend by getting a Juris Doctor degree. The title is a pun on the term \"legally blind\".\n\nThe film was released on July 13, 2001, and received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the critics' consensus states \"though the material is predictable and formulaic, Reese Witherspoon's funny, nuanced performance makes this movie better than it would have been otherwise\". It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture: Musical or Comedy and ranked 29th on Bravo's 2007 list of \"100 Funniest Movies\". Witherspoon received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and the 2002 MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance.\n\nThe box office success led to a 2003 sequel, \"\", and a 2009 direct-to-DVD spin-off, \"Legally Blondes\". Additionally, \"Legally Blonde: The Musical\" premiered on January 23, 2007, in San Francisco and opened in New York City at the Palace Theatre on Broadway on April 29, 2007, starring Laura Bell Bundy.\n\nAs of June 2018, Witherspoon has been in discussions with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce a third instalment in the \"Legally Blonde\" film series. In addition to reprising her role as Elle Woods, Witherspoon is bringing back both Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith to pen the film's script. MGM later confirmed in a Twitter post that \"Legally Blonde 3\" is set to be released on February 14, 2020.\n\nElle Woods, an attractive, wealthy and popular fashion merchandising student and president of her Delta Nu sorority, is crushed when her boyfriend Warner Huntington III breaks up with her over a romantic dinner rather than proposing to her, as she was expecting. He argues that he needs a more serious woman in order to fulfill his political aspirations, which include attending Harvard Law. Encouraged by her sorority sisters, Elle decides to also enroll in Harvard Law in order to win Warner back. After much effort, Elle manages to gain admission but soon discovers that the personalities and atmosphere in Harvard are very different from hers and she is thrown out of class during her first day by the strict Professor Stromwell and a classmate named Vivian for not having prepared for the lecture. Elle is later horrified to discover that Vivian is Warner's fiancée.\n\nNone of Elle's classmates take her seriously and she is friendless at the university aside from Emmett, an associate at Harvard who gives her advice on handling each of her professors, and a beautician named Paulette who encourages her to try to win over Warner. Elle repeatedly tries to fit in with the others but is repeatedly rebuffed. Vivian even goes so far as to lie to Elle about a party invitation, falsely telling her that it was a costume party, humiliating her in front of her classmates. She is also ridiculed by Warner after informing him of her intent to apply for a prestigious internship with Professor Callahan, as Warner tells her that she is not smart enough and is wasting her time. This motivates Elle to prove herself, as she begins to study law seriously and even manages to use her knowledge to help Paulette reclaim her dog from an ex-boyfriend.\n\nAfter several months of dramatic improvement, Elle, along with Warner, Vivian and another student Enid Wexler, is given an internship at Callahan's law office, where they will be working on a murder case, defending a prominent fitness instructor named Brooke Windham, who refuses to produce an alibi for the murder. Recognizing her as a personal role model and former Delta Nu member, Elle manages to discover the alibi but keeps it secret due to a personal promise with Brooke, which impresses Vivian and leads to the two women beginning to bond after it was revealed that she was keeping the alibi confidential and that Warner blatantly said to sell out her friend for benefits; during their alone time, Vivian revealing to Elle that Warner only got into Harvard via a call from his father (a distinguished alumni) to the school board, because he was on the waiting list.\n\nDuring the trial Elle manages to find holes in the prosecution's case such as proving that the prosecution's main witness was lying/perjuring about having an affair with Brooke, pointing out that he is gay. Seemingly impressed, Callahan invites Elle to his office later that evening, where he makes a sexual pass at her. Vivian witnesses the pass but not Elle angrily spurning his advances and angrily accuses Elle of using her looks to get ahead. Elle considers leaving Harvard and goes to Paulette's salon to let her know, but is encouraged by Professor Stromwell, who happened to be at the salon.\n\nWhen the trial resumes, Emmett explains to Brooke how Callahan's behavior caused Elle to quit her internship, leaving Vivian to regret her actions towards Elle. Brooke then decides to fire Callahan and replace him with Elle, who is able to defend her due to Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court rule 3.03, which allows Elle to legally appear on a defendant's behalf under Emmett's supervision, as he is a licensed attorney. Although nervous, Elle manages to catch Brooke's step-daughter Chutney in a lie during cross-examination, as she claimed that she could not have heard the gun shot because she was washing her hair after getting a perm earlier that day. Elle then points out that freshly permed hair cannot be washed within a 24-hour period without deactivating the perming chemical ammonium thioglycolate, which Chutney should know as she had received over 30 perm treatments during her life. Upset, Chutney accidentally reveals that she hated Brooke for being the same age as her. She confesses that she intended to shoot Brooke but accidentally shot and killed her father by mistake, thinking it was Brooke who had entered the house. Chutney is then arrested for murder, with all charges against Brooke dismissed. After the trial, Warner unsuccessfully tries to persuade Elle to take him back, only for her to mock him by stating that he is not serious enough for her.\n\nThe story ends with Elle graduating from Harvard two years later and giving the graduation speech. Vivian broke off her engagement to Warner and is now Elle's best friend, while Warner graduates with no honors, no job offers and no girlfriend. Paulette ends up marrying a UPS guy she had been infatuated with throughout the film and is expecting a baby, to be named Elle. Emmett has started his own firm and he and Elle have been dating since the trial, with him planning to propose to her later that night.\n\n\nThe film is based upon the book of the same name by Amanda Brown, who built the story upon her real life experiences as a blonde attending Stanford Law School, while being obsessed with fashion and beauty, reading \"Elle\" magazine, and frequently clashing with the personalities of her fellow peers.\n\nBrown said that when she first arrived to Stanford Law, she discovered she had made a big mistake. \"I was in my first week of law school, in 1993, and I saw this flyer for \"The Women of Stanford Law,\" so I was like, \"I'll go and meet some nice girls. Whatever.\"\n\nI went to the meeting, and these were not women. These were really angry people. The woman who was leading it spent three years at Stanford trying to change the name \"semester\" to \"ovester.\" I started laughing and I realized everyone in the room took it very seriously. So I didn't make any friends there.\n\nBrown wrote letters to her parents about these experiences, which she adapted into a manuscript and sent to an agent, who was initially drawn to it because it was the only manuscript written on pink paper.\n\nProducer Marc Platt was intrigued by the character of Elle Woods when an unpublished novel manuscript was delivered to him. \"What I loved about this story is that it's hilarious, it's sexy and, at the same time, it's empowering,\" says Platt. \"The world looks at Elle and sees someone who is blonde and beautiful but nothing more. Elle, on the other hand, doesn't judge herself or anybody else. She thinks the world's great, she's great, everyone's great and nothing can change that. She's truly an irrepressible modern heroine.\"\n\nScreenwriters Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith spent two days on Stanford's campus in the spring of 2000 doing research for their screenplay based on Brown's novel.\n\nBoth USC and Stanford refused to allow the producers to use their college names in the film. \"[The producers of the film] asked if they could set the film at USC, but the images of her as an undergraduate and being in a sorority ... we felt there was too much stereotyping going on,\" says Elijah May, campus filming coordinator at USC. The production settled on having Elle go to a fictional college called CULA.\n\nAlthough the film is primarily set at Harvard University, campus scenes were filmed at the University of Southern California, University of California, Los Angeles, California Institute of Technology, and Rose City High School in Pasadena, California. The graduation scene was filmed at Dulwich College in London, England, since Witherspoon was in that city filming \"The Importance of Being Earnest\". Harvard University appears in the film briefly in certain aerial shots.\n\nWitherspoon researched the character by studying sorority girls on their campuses and associated hot spots. She went to dinner with them and joked she was conducting an \"anthropological study.\"\n\n\"I could have gone into this and been really ditsy and played what I would have thought this character was, and I would have missed a whole other side of her,\" Witherspoon added. \"But by going down to Beverly Hills, hanging out in Neiman Marcus, eating in their cafe and seeing how these women walk and speak, I got into the reality of the character. I saw how polite these women are, and I saw how much they value their female friendships and how important it is to support each other.\"\n\nThe film's costume designer Sophie De Rakoff bonded with Witherspoon over Dolly Parton. De Rakoff said that Elle's iconic pink suit in the film \"was all organic and intuitive. I designed costumes for Elle Woods that moved the story forward and fitted the moment. Reese and I actually went to visit a sorority house in the early prep, and it was just obvious that pink should be her signature color.\"\n\nThe \"bend and snap\" scene — where Elle explains to Paulette how to get her crush's attention — almost didn't make it into the movie.\n\"[Producer] Marc [Platt] wanted a B plot for Paulette (Jennifer Coolidge),\" co-writer Karen McCullah told \"Entertainment Weekly\". \"At first we were like, 'Should the store be robbed?'\" Co-writer Kirsten Smith observed, \"I think we spent a week or two trying to figure out what the B plot and this big set piece should be. There were crime plots. We were pitching scene after scene and it all felt very tonally weird.\"\n\nLater, while brainstorming at a bar in Los Angeles, McCullah came up with a solution: \"What if Elle shows [Paulette] a move so she can get the UPS guy?\" In the spur of the moment, Smith invented a move, standing up and demonstrating what would become the bend and snap. Smith explains, \"It was a spontaneous invention. It was a completely drunken moment in a bar.\" Director Robert Luketic later adapted the \"bend and snap\" move into a dance number for the film.\n\n\"... It was a fully choreographed number by Toni Basil, and she was awesome,\" Witherspoon recalls. \"She did the whole dance.\"\n\n\"I remember just reading it and thinking it was the most hysterical thing ever,\" she added. \"That is still the most asked request I get from people. Even this past year, when I have been giving speeches or talking about whatever, they always ask me, 'Will you do the bend and snap?' I have a feeling I will be doing the bend and snap until I am 95.\"\n\n\"Legally Blonde\" was released on July 13, 2001 in North America. Its opening weekend gross of $20 million made it a sleeper hit for the struggling MGM studio, and it went on to gross $96.5 million in North America and $45.2 million elsewhere, for a worldwide total of $141.7 million. The film was released in the United Kingdom on October 26, 2001, and opened on #2, behind \"American Pie 2\".\n\nThe film was a critical success. Based on 130 reviews, collected by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 69% of the critics gave \"Legally Blonde\" positive ratings, ranking the film as \"fresh\". Most reviews praised Reese Witherspoon's lead performance, although some denigrated the overall film. Metacritic reported that the film had an average score of 59, based on 31 reviews. At the 2001 Golden Globe Awards ceremony, the film was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Picture – Musical or Comedy. The same year, Witherspoon was also nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Actress – Musical or Comedy.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nA soundtrack album was released in 2001 on A&M Records, including the songs:\n\nIn February 2007, a musical adaptation premiered on Broadway to mixed reviews, starring Laura Bell Bundy as Elle, Christian Borle as Emmett, Orfeh as Paulette, Nikki Snelson as Brooke, Richard H. Blake as Warner, Kate Shindle as Vivienne, and Michael Rupert as Callahan. Other cast members included Andy Karl, Leslie Kritzer, Annaleigh Ashford, DeQuina Moore, and Natalie Joy Johnson. The show, Bundy, Borle, and Orfeh were all nominated for Tony Awards. Later, the Broadway show was the focus of an MTV reality-TV series called \"\", in which the winner would take over the role of Elle on Broadway. Bailey Hanks from Anderson, South Carolina, won the competition.\n\n\"Legally Blonde\" had a successful run at the Savoy Theatre in London's West End, starring Sheridan Smith, Susan McFadden, and Carley Stenson as Elle, and Duncan James, Richard Fleeshman, Simon Thomas, and Ben Freeman as Warner. During the three-year run, the cast also included Alex Gaumond, Denise Van Outen, and Lee Mead.\n\n"}

His father died from tuberculosis when he was young.\n\nKenton left school aged 14 and started work in a paper factory. There he first encountered anti-semitism, which led him to join the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1929. He took part in the CPGB's disruption of the British Union of Fascists' rally at Olympia in June 1934 and resistance to the BUF in the Battle of Cable Street in October 1936.\n\nEarly in 1937 Kenton left Stepney and rode his Douglas motorcycle to Albacete, where he join the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. His first wife Lillian, an Austrian nurse who fled Nazi Germany in 1933, shortly followed him. When he arrived at the International Brigades headquarters in Albacete, he applied to join the International Brigade's Medical Unit. It was from there that he spent nearly two years in action as medical courier on his motorcycle distributing medical supplies to hospitals across the country, and as an ambulance driver on the front lines. He returned to Britain late in 1938 on an 'Aid for Spain' mission to raise money for a new ambulance. By the time he had completed his tour, the International Brigades had been disbanded.\n\nAfter the International Brigades were withdrawn from Spain, Kenton was hugely depressed. One of his missions was to repatriate to the Spanish authorities the Basque refugees given asylum in the United Kingdom. It was \"the first time I saw the fascist police in their three-cornered hats. All the children were in tears and all of them were hanging on to me as we checked each one and handed them over.\"\nKenton then joined the Merchant Navy and in the first part of the Second World War served on an Antarctic whaler, the \"Southern Princess\". He and Lillian were divorced and in 1941 Kenton married his second wife Raffa Ephgrave. He was wounded in The Blitz, spent two years in hospital and then took a factory job. After the Lidice massacre in Czechoslovakia in 1942, Kenton joined the British \"Lidice Shall Live\" organisation. He was an active member for many years and in the 1990s served as its Chairman.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Kenton joined the Homes for Heroes campaign, which helped homeless ex-servicemen and their families to squat in unoccupied properties. He joined the \"Financial Times\" as a proofreader, and continued to work there until he was in his 70s.\n\nKenton remained a devout communist, working tirelessly on trade union organisation, unemployed marches and party activities until 1968 when the Prague Spring was suppressed by the Soviet Union. He then joined the Labour Party and remained a member for the rest of his life.\n\nFrom 1980 Kenton produced commemorative pottery for the trade union movement and for radical causes. His work was commissioned by Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, Tobacco Workers' Union, Society of Graphical and Allied Trades, Trades Union Congress, areas of the National Union of Mineworkers, the People's March for Jobs, the International Brigade, Greater London Council Peace Year, National Council for Civil Liberties, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the Greenham Common women's campaign.\n\nKenton had two children and two granddaughters.\n\nOn 26 May 2009 it was announced that seven British pensioners were to be awarded Spanish passports at the Spanish Embassy in London on 9 June 2009. Kenton, then aged 101, was the eldest of them.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "59113262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59113262", "title": "Michal Cole", "text": "Michal Cole\n\nMichal Cole is a British-Israeli artist born in Haifa, Israel in 1974 to parents who emigrated from Morocco. She works primarily with the mediums of photography, video, tapestry, sculpture, watercolour and uses money in her works.\n\nAfter completing her service in the Israeli Defence Forces, Michal left Israel in the mid 1990s and travelled to Paris to take foundational art courses, while being homeless for a period of time. She settled in London in 1997, where she pursued her Bachelor of Arts in Fine Art from Central Saint Martin’s College of Art & Design. While attending university she created a number of works in which she used fragments of real money. A group of bankers were interested in buying many of her works and ended up becoming inappropriately sexual in their language with her. After they gave her their ties after believing she was flirting with them, she used them as inspiration and materials for her 2017 Venice Biennale Pavilion of Humanity exhibition \"Top Gun.\" Cole later completed her Master of Art in Fine Art from Chelsea College of Arts at the University of the Arts London in 2013.\n\nIn Michal Cole’s textile pieces \"Inferno\", 2013 and \"Clamare\", 2013, Cole referenced famous art pieces such as Sandro Botticelli's \"Mappa dell’Inferno\" and Edvard Munch's \"The Scream\" with lavish colours and cheerful compositions through textiles. She attempted to bring religious figurative paintings back to life through the more contemporary medium of tapestry that more accurately depicted current views and beliefs as a reflection of society.\n\nExhibited at the 2017 Venice Biennale, Michal Cole created a work titled \"Top Gun\" in the Pavilion of Humanity, which was made of tens of thousands of used men’s ties including those of men she knew and men who had either harassed her or her friends. The ties were strenuously tied together to cover the floor, walls, a fireplace, a sofa, a pipe, a mounted moose on the wall and a rifle which all encompass a traditionally masculine styled living room. Ties were specifically chosen as they represent a piece of clothing typically worn by men for historically masculine activities such as boardroom and workplace life, witnessing business deals, hiring employees, and winding down at a pub. Cole’s intention of the subject was to comment on the oppression of women that is more apparent under Donald Trump’s government than ever before; including issues such as the gender pay gap, sexual harassment and a predominantly male political office. The piece similarly spoke to personal inequalities that were apparent in Cole’s life, such as her being a victim of sexual abuse, serving mandatory time in the military where hundreds of cases of sexual assault are disregarded, and her grandmother being a child bride.\n\nMichal Cole’s use of textiles has been exhibited in pieces such as \"After Caravaggio\" and \"Roses\" in a process where she replicated famous paintings and destroyed them before the paint had dried. The pieces were later transformed in to fabric textiles, which involved mapping out and recreating the paintings with materials such as Tibetan highland wool, Bikaner wool, Chinese silk and nettle.\n\nMichal Cole exhibited a site-specific video installation at Ex Bazzi Gallery at the 2015 Venice Biennale’s Pavilion of Humanity titled \"Mute-Ululation.\" This work addresses Cole’s identity as a resident of England who is of Sephardi ethnicity. For this installation, Michal travelled to Morocco and Israel and filmed women’s mouths while performing the traditional celebratory ululation: a long, repetitive, high-pitched vocal sound that involves the rapid movement of the tongue side to side in the mouth. On three walls in a darkened room, the videos of these women assemble frame-by-frame until there are hundreds of mouths simultaneously performing the ululation at a loud volume. This work was used to showcase a unifying bond amongst women that transcends geographical borders, religions and ideologies, while empowering these women and showcasing their poetic happiness and expression. It similarly is a piece in which Cole grapples with her own identity as having significant elements of her life that are tied in Middle-Eastern and Moroccan culture while having adopted aspects of Western culture due to living in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter numerous visits to Istanbul, Michal Cole met Ekin Onat, a Turkish Muslim artist who addresses female and political issues of contemporary Turkey. The two staged their joint project \"Objection\" in the Pavilion of Humanity at the 2017 Venice Biennale. The project revolved around the notion of the home, based on their independent yet complementary artistic interpretations.\n\nThe exhibition, which featured a number of rooms in an artificial home included Cole’s textile room \"Top Gun and\" raised the question of the role of arts and culture in times of crisis, political upheaval and change while uniformly making an argument of compassion and non-violent protest. Both women transformed the Venetian villa “to give an artistic home to women’s rights and free speech.”\n\nThrough the numerous rooms in the home, both artists contemplate with political oppression and the power of speech, which is shown in Cole’s \"Domestic Godless,\" a video installation in the kitchen which showcased different videos coming from screens inside cups, bowls and teapots, in which the subject is shown to be screaming. The videos are meant to be representative of a time in Cole’s life where she was left ‘howling like an injured dog’ and addresses the role of women across all planes of human existence. Specifically it showcases how inner frustrations at unrealistic pressures are universally placed upon women, such as being beautiful, smart, maternal, and sexual. In the traditionally feminized location of the kitchen, the screams and female outrage can be heard coming from the videos, giving the voice to the woman, where she would have traditionally taken on a role of servitude.\n\nThe upper floor of the home held collaborative works by the two artists titled \"The Journey Between Human Being\" and \"Being Human.\" Voices could be heard coming from behind a locked door and when the listener approached the keyhole in an attempt to get the clearest sound, the voices became increasingly overlapped making it apparent that different languages were being spoken between the women. The themes of speaking and silence continued in the master bedroom, where \"Absent Presence\" is a life-like model of the artist sitting with their backs facing one-another on the bed.\n\nApart from showcasing work twice at the Venice Biennale, in 2015 and 2017, as well as exhibiting in Sotheby’s Michal Cole has exhibited her work worldwide to much acclaim. She is the winner of the My Art Space Scope Miami competition, the 2011 Signature Art Awards, the Saatchi Gallery’s Showdown competition award in London.\n\nAfter visiting London as a teenager, Cole built a group titled the \"Heavy Metalists\" in Tel Aviv which took over nightclubs and formed a mini revolution of anarchy and mayhem. The intention of the group was to challenge existing local beliefs, views, fashion and musical tastes by communicating new ideas of freedom, specifically artistic freedom, atheism and passion for challenging conformity. The group, led by Cole until the age of 18, grew in popularity and was featured in mainstream media. After running away to Paris when she was 17 in an attempt to avoid recruitment, Cole was recruited at age 18 to the Israeli Defense Forces to serve mandatory military service.\n\nMichal Cole’s parents are Moroccan Jews who trace their roots back to the Jews of Spain who migrated to Morocco after the Spanish Inquisition. Her parents left Morocco in the early 1950s, being deported by sea to Israel where they were placed in refugee camps and suffered poverty and racial discrimination as a new minority in Israel. Much of Cole’s work involves the notions of displacement and exile – both internal and external. Due to the merging of her Moroccan-Israeli ethnicity and adopted Western cultural aspects, she explores the collisions of tradition and modernity while similarly delving in to the roles of women and the absurdity of global inequality in her work.\n\nMichal Cole uses her artworks as a form of celebration and examination of the human condition while inviting the viewer to contemplate the beauty, joy, and humour of life set against the uncontrollable social, economic, political and religious injustices and hypocrisies that inevitably affect us. She is specifically fascinated by moments of transition – economical transitions, religious shifts, the collapse of beliefs and infrastructures and loss of faith. Cole attempts to envision the possibility of order born from chaos and mayhem, creativity out of destruction and inspiration derived from man’s fallibility and stupidity.\n\nThe artist Cole is most inspired by is Caravaggio due to his rebelliousness and insanity, and the eroticism, drama and violence of his work. She spent a summer touring Italy in search of his original artworks.\n"}

{"id": "20429006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20429006", "title": "Norwegian art", "text": "Norwegian art\n\nFor much of its history Norwegian art is usually considered as part of the wider Nordic art of Scandinavia. It has, especially since about 1100, been strongly influenced by wider trends in European art. After World War II, the influence of the United States strengthened substantially. Due to generous art subsidies, contemporary Norwegian art has a high production per capita.\n\nThough usually not especially a major centre for art production or exporter of art, Norway has been relatively successful in keeping its art; in particular, the relatively mild nature of the Norwegian Reformation, and the lack of subsequent extensive rebuilding and redecoration of churches, has meant that with other Scandinavian countries, Norway has unusually rich survivals of medieval church paintings and fittings. One period when Nordic art exerted a strong influence over the rest of northern Europe was in Viking art, and there are many survivals, both in stone monuments left untouched around the countryside, and objects excavated in modern times.\n\nThe Reformation and the loss of a permanent royal court after the Kalmar Union of 1397 greatly disrupted Norwegian artistic traditions, and left the existing body of painters and sculptors without large markets. The requirements of the small aristocratic class were mainly for portraits, usually by imported artists, and it was not until the 19th century that significant numbers of Norwegians were trained in contemporary styles. \n\nNorwegian art came into its own in the 19th century, especially with the early landscape painters. Until that time, the art scene in Norway had been dominated by imports from Germany and Holland and by the influence of Danish rule. Initially with landscape painting, later with Impressionism and Realism. Though for the rest of the world Edvard Munch (1863–1944) is certainly Norway's great artistic figure, there have been many other significant figures.\n\nJohan Christian Dahl (1788–1857) is often said to be the \"father of Norwegian landscape painting\". After a period in Copenhagen, he joined the Dresden school to which he made an important contribution. He eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time.\n\nAnother important early contributor was Johannes Flintoe (1787–1870), a Danish-Norwegian painter, known for his Norwegian landscapes and paintings of folk costumes. He taught at the School of Drawing (\"Tegneskolen\") in Christiania from 1819 to 1851 where his students included budding romanticists such as Hans Gude and Johan F. Eckersberg.\n\nAdolph Tidemand (1814–1876) studied in Copenhagen, in Italy and finally in Düsseldorf where he settled. He often returned to Norway where he painted the old Norwegian farm culture. His best known painting is \"The bridal procession in Hardanger\" (together with Hans Gude, 1848) and \"Haugianerne\" (\"Haugeans\") painted in 1852.\n\nNorway’s new-found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as Kitty Kielland, 1843–1914, an early female painter who studied under Gude and Harriet Backer, 1845–1932, another pioneer among female artists, influenced by impressionism.\n\nFrits Thaulow, 1847–1906, an impressionist, was initially a student of Hans Gude. He was later influenced by the art scene in Paris where he developed impressionist talents. Returning to Norway in 1880, he became one of the leading figures on the Norwegian art scene, together with Christian Krohg and Erik Werenskiold.\n\nChristian Krohg, 1852–1925, a realist painter, was also influenced by the Paris scene. He is remembered for his paintings of prostitutes which caused something of a scandal.\n\nThorolf Holmboe (1866–1935) studied under Hans Gude in Berlin between 1886 and 1887 and Fernand Cormon in Paris between 1889 and 1891. He was inspired by many different styles at different points in his career, including Naturalism, Neo-romanticism, Realism and Impressionism.\n\nNikolai Astrup (1880–1928) grew up in Jølster in the west of Norway. After studying art in Oslo and spending some time in Paris and in Germany, he returned to Jølster where he specialised in painting expressionist landscapes with clear, strong colors. He is considered to be one of the greatest Norwegian artists from the early 20th century.\n\nLars Hertervig (1830–1902) from Tysvær in south-western Norway painted semi-fantastical works inspired by the coastal landscape in Ryfylke. Hertervig completed a number of works on paper using aquarelles and often making the paper base himself from scrapes of discarded pieces of paper. The art museum under the main museum, Stavanger Museum, in Stavanger, Rogaland (previously Rogaland Museum of Fine Art) has the most significant collection of works by Hertervig in Norway. \n\nHarald Sohlberg, (1869–1935), a neo-romanticist, is remembered for his paintings of Røros, and the Norwegian \"national painting\" \"Winter's Night in Rondane\".\n\nNorway's most famous artist is certainly Edvard Munch (1863–1944), a symbolist/expressionist who became world-famous for \"The Scream\", one of the most recognizable paintings in all art. It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man.\n\nOther noteworthy 19th century painters are: August Cappelen, Peder Balke, Peter Nicolai Arbo, Eilif Peterssen, Gustav Wentzel, Oscar Wergeland, Erik Werenskiold, Asta Nørregaard, Amaldus Nielsen, Oda Krohg, Fritz Thaulow, Carl Sundt-Hansen, Christian Skredsvig, Gunnar Berg, Halfdan Egedius, Theodor Kittelsen, Harald Sohlberg.\n\nNoteworthy artists from 20th century Norwegian art are: Harald Sohlberg, Reidar Aulie, Per Krohg, Arne Ekeland, Kai Fjell, Jacob Weidemann, Håkon Bleken, Jens Johannessen, Ludvig Karsten, Henrik Sørensen, Kjartan Slettemark, Anna-Eva Bergman, Anders Kjær, Svein Johansen, Svein Bolling, Bjørn Carlsen, Bjørn Ransve, Kåre Tveter, Frans Widerberg, Odd Nerdrum, Ida Lorentzen, Knut Rose, Ørnulf Opdahl, Håvard Vikhagen, Leonard Rickhard, Håkon Gullvåg, Kira Wager, Halvard Storm, Lars Elling, Vibeke Barbel Slyngstad.\n\n19th-century sculptors include Stephan Sinding, Gunnar Utsond, Brynjulf Bergslien and Mathias Skeibrok.\n\n20th-century sculptors include Gustav Vigeland, Nils Aas, Arnold Haukeland, Bård Breivik, Anne Grimdalen, Kristofer Leirdal, Per Palle Storm, Nina Sundbye, Dyre Vaa and Wilhelm Rasmussen. \n\nIn textile art Hannah Ryggen (1894–1970) holds a unique position.

The term is not formally established in either philosophy or linguistics. According to Irish linguist Raymond Hickey, phonaesthetics is concerned with \"the possible connection between sound sequences and meaning\" particularly through sound symbolism, and according to British linguist David Crystal, it is \"a term sometimes used in linguistics to refer to the study of the aesthetic properties of sound\". According to Crystal: \n\nThe application of said aesthetic properties of sound, phonaesthetics, and their meaning in media has yet to be studied extensively. That being said, the study of sound aesthetics is a burgeoning field waiting to be studied by phonaestheticians everywhere.\n\nSound has many qualitative aspects, some of which are subjectively regarded as euphony and cacophony.\n\nEuphony is the effect of sounds being pleasant, rhythmical, or harmonious. An example of euphony is the poem \"Some Sweet Day\".\n\nCacophony is the effect of sounds being harsh and often discordant. These sounds are often meaningless and jumbled together.\nA discordant series of harsh, unpleasant sounds helps to convey disorder.

Jake asks his best friend, Davis McDonald (Alec Baldwin) before the wedding if he thinks he will be happy, to which his friend says, \"Yeah, you'll be happy. You just won't know it.\"\n\nAfter their wedding, Jake and Kristy head off for New Mexico, where Jake works towards gaining a Master's Degree, but leaves before finishing. They return to Chicago where Jake is hired as an advertising copywriter. Jake says he wants to be a writer, which amuses his boss. Kristy is hired as a research analyst, and they are able to buy a house in the suburbs.\n\nJake's best friend suddenly visits after not seeing him for two years. Davis tells them that his father has died, and Jake and Kristy are supportive, allowing him to stay the night. Things take a turn for the worse when Davis makes a pass at Kristy, by trying to get her bathrobe open and proclaiming his feelings, but Kristy turns him down, telling him that she is in love with Jake. Meanwhile, Jake begins fantasizing about having an affair with a mysterious young French model.\n\nJake and Kristy continue to adjust to their new lives until Kristy decides to stop taking contraceptives without telling Jake, until after several months, she informs him that he has been unable to impregnate her. Jake feels pressure from society and from his wife to have a child. The couple begins a fertility program, which eventually succeed. They tell their parents, and while all are overjoyed, Kristy's mother casually informs them that she had a difficult birth with Kristy and nearly died. During a traumatic labor, Jake realizes that his lack of satisfaction was due to his selfishness and immaturity.\n\nThe last scene of the film reveals that Jake's voiceover was the new father reading his novel entitled \"She's Having a Baby\" to his wife and son.\n\n\nThe film was shot in Winnetka, IL and Evanston, IL from September 1986 to December 1986. However, several scenes were shot directly in the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois. Most of John Hughes's films either take place in Chicago, in the suburbs of Chicago, or are about people going to or coming from Chicago.\n\nThe She's Having a Baby soundtrack album was released in 1988 on I.R.S. Records label and produced by Dave Wakeling.\n\nThe song during the birth sequence is \"This Woman's Work\" by Kate Bush and is featured on her 1989 album \"The Sensual World\". John Hughes is thanked in the album's liner notes.\n\nThe song playing during the trailer is \"Music for a Found Harmonium\" by the Penguin Cafe Orchestra.\nThe song played during the street party is \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)\" by Marvin Gaye.\n\n\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews from critics and has 38% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes based on 39 reviews. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave \"She's Having a Baby\" a mixed 2 stars out of 4. He wrote that the film \"begins with the simplest and most moving of stories and interrupts it with an amazing assortment of gimmicks,\" being salvaged only by strong performances from Bacon and McGovern.\n\nIn \"\" director Kevin Smith cites \"She's Having a Baby\" as his favorite John Hughes movie. He also cites it as a template for \"Jersey Girl\", joking that both movies were financially unsuccessful.\n\n"}

They describe their style as \"neo-Chinese chic\", where the aesthetics of Chinese clothing and handicraft are combined with Western styles, using design features drawn from Chinese culture such as mandarin collars and Chinese patterns. In 2010 \"Forbes\" magazine ranked Wang as one of the 25 most influential Chinese in global fashion.\n\nWang Chen Tsai-Hsia was born in 1951 in Changhua, Taiwan. She was not formally educated in the industry, learning her trade by working at her uncle's factory.\n\nIn 1978, she and her husband, Wang Yuan-hong (王元宏), a businessman in the textile trade, founded the Shiatzy International Company Limited in 1978. For over 30 years Wang worked to establish her name in the local market and build up an extensive client list. The company is one of the few homegrown designer labels in Taiwan with an international clientele including the President of Taiwan Ma Ying-jeou, Taiwanese celebrities including Dee Shu, Patty Hou, Wang Leehom and Aska Yang; local politicians such as Jason Hu, businesswomen such as Pansy Ho and Shaw-Lan Wang; and British celebrities such as Elizabeth Hurley and Victoria Beckham. The Taiwan market is the company's major source of revenue. In Taiwan, Shiatzy Chen fashion shows, rather than showing upcoming collections, present the current season to their VIP clients, who purchase the clothes for their own use, rather than commercial buyers looking to buy upcoming styles.\n\nWhile predominantly a womenswear company, in 1987 the company added a menswear line. While not bespoke menswear, the range includes off-the-peg changpaos intended for weddings and traditional engagement parties. A popular line is their quilted, often reversible, winter jackets, available in a wide range of styles, fabrics, patterns and color combinations. In about 2007 they expanded their catalogue with accessories (sold in all stores) and a line of furniture available from their three flagship stores in Taipei, Shanghai and Paris.\n\nIn June 2010, Shiatzy Chen and the tea culture brand Cha Cha Thé (采采食茶文化) opened an exclusive sales area in the super upscale Galeries Lafayette department store in Paris, along with a tea lounge in Taipei, where customers could come for tea, and purchase tea-wares and other gifts.\n\nIn 1990 Shiatzy Chen set up a studio in Paris to stay on top of fashion trends and to learn more about Western dressmaking techniques. This studio also serves as a training center for Taiwanese dressmakers and designers. They opened a flagship store in Paris in 2001.\n\nThe label has been listed on the London-based \"Financial Times\" pick of what is hot in 2004. It was also deemed the most popular fashion brand in Taiwan by \"The Wall Street Journal Asia\".\n\nIn 2003 the company entered the Chinese market, opening a third flagship store in Shanghai, on The Bund in October 2005; with further stores in Hong Kong and Beijing. Restoration on the building began in late 2001. The interior was designed by Indonesian designer Jaya Ibrahim. The company aimed to have 50 stores in mainland China by 2010 in addition to their 48 outlets in Taiwan, 23 directly managed stores and 25 department store counters.\n\nIn 2007 they opened a second factory, measuring 6000 square meters, in Shanghai alongside the existing one in Taipei. This new factory was designed by German architect Johannes Hartfuss to accommodate a workforce of more than 1,000 employees, including dressmakers and embroiderers, producing tens of thousands of clothing items annually based on over 400 styles created by its designers.\n\nOn 5 October 2008 Shiatzy Chen debuted at Paris Fashion Week, making Wang just the second Taiwanese design house (after YufengShawn, 馭風騷, in 2005) to have officially shown there. They presented their show at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts on the Left Bank in central Paris, and have shown there in subsequent years, including an Anna Wintour inspired collection for Fall-Winter 2010-11. On 9 November 2009, the company became a member of the Chambre syndicale du prêt-à-porter des couturiers et des créateurs de mode. \n\nIn 2010, they held a record-breaking exhibition of 100 flower-themed dresses at the Taipei International Flora Exposition, presented on the longest catwalk seen in the Taiwan fashion business.\n\nIn 2011 the company reported sales of about US$60 million.\n\n\n\n"}

She notes that a total number of victims is unknown but that the high number often given is nine million deaths, over a period of 300 or more years. Otherwise, scholarly \"high\" estimates range around 100,000, with estimates around 60,000 more common.\nThe nine million figure, according to modern scholarship, originates with a 1784 article by Gottfried Christian Voigt.\n\nAccording to William Donohue and Robert Eady of the Catholic Civil Rights League, the movie is inaccurate in other respects, \"e.g.\", placing Trier in France instead of Germany, and dating a stone cross there that is recorded to have been erected in 958 AD to 1132 AD without further explanation. The cross is shown as a \"symbol of a new religious cult that was sweeping across Europe,\" despite Christian presence since 286. Eady, a member of the League in Canada, has cited the film in a complaint to broadcast regulators, in particular mentioning offense at the movie's quote: \"it took the Church two hundred years of terror and death to transform the image of paganism into devil worship, and folk culture into heresy.\" Eady describes the documentary as propaganda intended to represent the Christian Church as \"a wicked, patriarchal, misogynist institution\".\nJack Kapica adds \"Women have genuine grievances with the Church. \"The Burning Times\", however, is not going to help their cause.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "92642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92642", "title": "The Defiant Ones", "text": "The Defiant Ones\n\nThe Defiant Ones is a 1958 crime film which tells the story of two escaped prisoners, one white and one black, who are shackled together and who must co-operate in order to survive. It stars Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier.\n\nThe film was adapted by Harold Jacob Smith from the story by Nedrick Young, originally credited as Nathan E. Douglas. It was directed by Stanley Kramer.\n\nThe film was highly regarded at the time of its release; it won Academy Awards for Cinematography (Black-and-White) and Original Screenplay and was nominated for seven others, including Best Picture and Best Actor for both Poitier and Curtis. Poitier won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nThe film starts with a truck driving at night. It swerves to miss another truck and crashes through a barrier. The rescuers clear up the debris and cover the people killed... mainly prisoners in the back. It is revealed that two are missing: a black man shackled to a white man, because \"the warden had a sense of humor.\" They are told not to look too hard as \"they will probably kill each other in the first five miles.\" Nevertheless, a large posse and many bloodhounds are dispatched the next morning to find them.\n\nThe setting is in the American South, the men are the black Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier) and the white John \"Joker\" Jackson (Curtis). Despite their mutual hatred, they are forced to cooperate, as they are chained together. At first their cooperation is motivated by self-preservation but gradually, they begin to respect and like each other.\n\nCullen and Joker flee through difficult terrain and weather, with a brief stop at a turpentine camp where they attempt to break into a general store, in hopes of obtaining food and tools to break the chain that holds them together. Instead, however, they are captured by the inhabitants, who form a lynch mob; they are saved only by the interference of \"Big\" Sam (Chaney), a man who is appalled by his neighbors' bloodthirst. Sam persuades the onlookers to lock the convicts up and turn them in the next morning, but that night, he secretly releases them, after revealing to them that he is also a former chain-gang prisoner.\n\nFinally, they run into a young boy named Billy. They make him take them to his home and his mother (Williams), whose husband has abandoned his family. The escapees are finally able to break their chains. When they spend the night there, the lonely woman is attracted to Joker and wants to run off with him. She advises Cullen to go through the swamp to reach the railroad tracks, while she and Joker drive off in her car. The men agree to split up. However, after Cullen leaves, the woman reveals that she had lied—she sent Cullen into the dangerous swamp to die to eliminate any chance he would be captured and perhaps reveal where Joker had gone. Furious, Joker runs after his friend; as he leaves, Billy shoots him.\n\nWounded, Joker catches up to Cullen and warns him about the swamp. As the posse led by humane Sheriff Max Muller (Bikel) gets close, the escapees can hear the dogs on their trail. They also hear a train whistle and run toward it. Cullen hops the train and tries to lift Joker aboard, but is unable to do so. Both men tumble to the ground. Too exhausted to run, they realize all they can do is wait for their pursuers. The sheriff finds Cullen singing defiantly and Joker lying in his arms.\n\n\nRobert Mitchum, a veteran of a Southern chain gang, turned down the role of Jackson because blacks and whites would never be chained together in the segregated South. The story was corrupted into the claim, repeated by Curtis and others, that Mitchum refused to work with a black man. Kramer wrote that Poitier was initially unsure of Curtis' casting but became supportive. Curtis, however, denied this; he stated that he had contractual rights to approve who would play Cullen. However, despite Curtis' many later claims and stories, Kramer had originally cast Poitier and Marlon Brando as the two leads when a previous contractual obligation prevented Poitier from being able to accept the role. Kramer wanted Poitier for the role so badly that he delayed the film's production, which led to Brando having to decline because the delay caused shooting to overlap with another obligation he had. Curtis was cast afterwards. Curtis did request Poitier's name appear with his above the movie title marking a first for Poitier in his career.\n\nCarl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer, of the \"Our Gang\" comedies, has a small role. It was his last before his death.\n\nThe film made a profit of $1 million.\n\nWhen the film was first released, Bosley Crowther, film critic for \"The New York Times\", lauded the production and the acting in the film, writing, \"A remarkably apt and dramatic visualization of a social idea—the idea of men of different races brought together to face misfortune in a bond of brotherhood—is achieved by producer Stanley Kramer in his new film, \"The Defiant Ones\"... Between the two principal performers there isn't much room for a choice. Mr. Poitier stands out as the Negro convict and Mr. Curtis is surprisingly good. Both men are intensely dynamic. Mr. Poitier shows a deep and powerful strain of underlying compassion...In the ranks of the pursuers, Theodore Bikel is most impressive as a sheriff with a streak of mercy and justice, which he has to fight to maintain against a brutish state policeman, played by Charles McGraw.\"\n\n\"Variety\" magazine likewise praised the acting and discussed the film's major theme, writing, \"The theme of \"The Defiant Ones\" is that what keeps men apart is their lack of knowledge of one another. With that knowledge comes respect, and with respect comradeship and even love. This thesis is exercised in terms of a colored and a white man, both convicts chained together as they make their break for freedom from a Southern prison gang. The performances by Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier are virtually flawless. Poitier captures all of the moody violence of the convict, serving time because he assaulted a white man who had insulted him. It is a cunning, totally intelligent portrayal that rings powerfully true...Curtis delivers a true surprise performance. He starts off as a sneering, brutal character, willing to fight it out to-the-death with his equally stubborn companion. When, in the end, he sacrifices a dash for freedom to save Poitier, by saving him from the swamp, he has managed the transition with such skill that sympathy is completely with him.\"\n\n\n\nThe basis of \"The Defiant Ones\" was revisited several times in popular media:\n\n\n\n"}

The film was awarded the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, and Annette Bening was awarded the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film also received four Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture, at the 83rd Academy Awards.\n\nNic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) are a married same-sex couple living in the Los Angeles area. Nic is a lesbian obstetrician, and Jules is a bisexual housewife who is starting up a landscape design business. Each has given birth to a child using the same sperm donor.\n\nThe younger child Laser (Josh Hutcherson) wants to find his biological father, but has to be 18 to do so. He implores his 18-year-old sister, Joni (Mia Wasikowska), to contact the sperm bank which identifies Paul (Mark Ruffalo) as the donor. The three meet. Joni is impressed by his bohemian lifestyle, and Paul becomes enthusiastic about being in their lives. Joni swears her brother to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers. However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner. When Jules reveals she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to transform his back garden. Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea.\n\nWhile working for Paul, Jules likes that he appreciates her work in contrast to Nic who, Jules feels, never supported her career. Jules impulsively kisses Paul one afternoon, and they end up in bed together, beginning an affair.\n\nJules and the kids start spending more time with Paul. Nic believes Paul undermines her authority over the children by, for example, giving Joni a ride on his motorcycle—which Nic has forbidden—and by suggesting she give Joni more freedom. After a heated argument with Jules, Nic suggests they all have dinner at Paul's house to ease the tension. Nic relaxes and for the first time connects with Paul. However, Nic discovers traces of Jules's hair in Paul's bathroom and bedroom. When they return home, Nic confronts Jules. At first, Jules denies it but then admits to the affair. Nic is devastated, but Jules assures she is not in love with Paul and has not turned straight; she just wanted to be appreciated. Joni and Laser have overheard the arguments and are also upset at Jules. The household becomes tense and Jules is forced to sleep on the couch. Paul thinks he has fallen in love with Jules and suggests she leave Nic, bring the kids, and come live with him. Jules declines, disgusted with Paul's lack of understanding about their relationship. The children are angry at both of them.\n\nThe night before Joni leaves home to go to college, Paul turns up at the house. Nic angrily confronts him and tells him that if he wants a family, he should make one of his own. Rejected, Paul watches Laser from outside the window, trying to get his attention, but Laser ignores him. Later that night, Jules tearfully admits her errors to her family and begs their forgiveness. The next morning, the family takes Joni off to college. While Nic and Jules together hug Joni to say goodbye, they also affectionately touch each other. During the ride home, Laser tells his mothers that they should not break up because they are too old. Jules and Nic giggle, and the film ends with them smiling at each other and holding hands.\n\n\nLisa Cholodenko and Blumberg began outlining the script in late 2004, based in part on some aspects of her life. The project was helped to get off the ground by the caliber of actors who agreed to join, first Julianne Moore, followed by Mark Ruffalo and Annette Bening. Cholodenko stated, \"People really admired what Stuart [Blumberg] and I got on the page but there was a fear factor regarding how the film was going to make money, as the subject matter is tricky.\" The film nearly got the green-light in 2006, but Cholodenko postponed the project after she became pregnant by way of an anonymous sperm donor. After giving birth, she resumed work on the film and won financing from three major investors, including the French distributor UGC.\n\nPrincipal photography was completed in 23 days in Los Angeles in July 2009. The film was made for approximately $4 million. The filmmakers rushed to finish the post-production in time for the Sundance Film Festival, where it was admitted after the deadline for competitive entries. On January 25, 2010 the film had its premiere, becoming one of the festival's breakout hits. A few days later, Focus Features acquired the distribution rights for $4.8 million. At the 60th Berlinale the film won a Teddy Award. The film closed the 2010 Sydney Film Festival and opened the Los Angeles Film Festival.\n\nOpening in limited release at seven theaters, \"The Kids Are All Right\" grossed $491,971 in its first weekend. At $70,282 per theater, the film scored the highest average gross in 2010 as of mid-July 2010. It expanded to 38 theaters on July 16, then 201 on July 23, and finally 847 on July 30. , the film grossed a total of $34,705,850 worldwide.\n\nThe film was released to wide acclaim from critics, with Bening receiving widespread praise for her performance. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 93% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 211 reviews. The site's consensus is that \"Worthwhile as both a well-acted ensemble piece and as a smart, warm statement on family values, \"The Kids Are All Right\" is remarkable.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 1–100 reviews from film critics, has a rating score of 86 based on 39 reviews, with the film in the \"universal acclaim\" category. Roger Ebert gave the film 3½ stars out of 4 and wrote, \"\"The Kids Are All Right” centers on a lesbian marriage, but is not about one. It's a film about marriage itself, an institution with challenges that are universal. Just imagine: You're expected to live much, if not all, of your married life with another adult. We're not raised for this.\" The film appeared on 39 critics' top ten movie lists for the year 2010. Anthony Quinn of \"The Independent\" and Elizabeth Weitzman of the \"Daily News\" both listed it as the best film of the year, while four other critics picked it as the second best movie of the year.\n\nAnnette Bening won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.

That was an unsettled period for the author and this is thought to be reflected in the story's dark subject matter. It also marks \"the first time that J. R. R.

Known as a source (among others) for Túrin Turambar, \"The Story of Kullervo\" was the centre of Tolkien's efforts in 1914, as he was \"trying to turn one of the stories [of the \"Kalevala\"] — which is really a very great story and most tragic – into a short story\" (\"Letters\", October 1914, #1).\n\n\"The Story of Kullervo\" was edited by Verlyn Flieger, published in 2010 in \"Tolkien Studies\", and republished in book form in August 2015 by HarperCollins.\n\n"}

The painting shows development from Miró's earlier works, such as \"The Farm\", and is considered to be one of his first Surrealist works, created around the same time as the more abstracted \"Catalan Landscape (The Hunter)\".\n\nThe painting measures . It is dominated by muted tones of yellow and brown. The image is divided into three areas by two horizontal lines, perhaps representing the sky, sea and earth; a diagonal line seems to put the top right corner of the painting in the dark of night, while the rest is in the light of day. The painting is littered with a confused mixture of forms, many with aspects of humans, animals, and plants. The various animal forms are derived from Catalan ceramics, including a lizard wearing a conical hat. A tree to the right of centre has a large eye in its green crown and a human ear on its brown trunk. Hanging from the tree is a shape covered with more eyes, possibly a pinecone, or perhaps a leaf or a spider; at the base of the tree is a folded newspaper with the French word \"jour\" (day).

There are fertility-related side-effects to tucking, such as a reduced sperm count. Some types of clothing, such as gaffs and bloxers are purposefully designed to inadvertently conceal the male crotch bulge.\n\nOne method of tucking involves pulling the penis backwards in between the legs while simultaneously pushing the testicles up into the inguinal canal. In order to secure this position in place, some trans women may use especially tight undergarments and a leotard that has a strap. Another practice is the flattening or binding by using tape to fasten the genitalia along the perineum and if possible in between the buttocks. There are also improvised or home-made contrivances whereby an elastic waistband is cut off from an existing garment and then a pouch placed along the middle to then be pulled up.\n\nSome male cross-dressers and pre- and non-op transgender women use purpose-made panty-like garments, often called gaffs, that serve to hide the genitalia and provide a feminine flat and smooth crotch area.\n\nThe practice of tucking is also observed among cisgender men for reasons other than appearing female, done in different manners. Some men do it because they feel embarrassment, while others do it to hide an erection, to desexualize themselves out of a sense of prudishness or phallophobia or because the bulge is prominent at an inappropriate moment. Methods of tucking include placing the penis behind the waistband sometimes colloquially referred to as \"uptuck\" while some men may wear purposefully designed compressing underwear. Variations of tucking may be used by macrophallic men when they perceive their crotch bulge to have an obscene appearance. There are some types of boxer shorts and boxer briefs that are designed to conceal the male crotch bulge, such as bloxers.\n"}

Endlessly fascinated by accounts of religion, belief, myth, legend and fairytales... I'm one of those pathetic non-believers philosopher Alain de Botton bangs on about. The sad, godless orphans who can't pass a church or temple without entering to light a candle or offer a flower.\"\n\nIn an essay in \"Destroying The Joint: Why Women Have To Change The World\" edited by Jane Caro, Harmer wrote that her two children have been confirmed into the Catholic Church.\n\nHarmer is married to Brendan and has two children. \nShe is a co-founder, of the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles's Angels, the women supporters' group for the local Rugby League club.\n\n"}

{"id": "33974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33974", "title": "Will Eisner", "text": "Will Eisner\n\nWilliam Erwin Eisner (March 6, 1917 – January 3, 2005) was an American cartoonist, writer, and entrepreneur. He was one of the earliest cartoonists to work in the American comic book industry, and his series \"The Spirit\" (1940–1952) was noted for its experiments in content and form. In 1978, he popularized the term \"graphic novel\" with the publication of his book \"A Contract with God\". He was an early contributor to formal comics studies with his book \"Comics and Sequential Art\" (1985). The Eisner Award was named in his honor, and is given to recognize achievements each year in the comics medium; he was one of the three inaugural inductees to the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame.\n\nEisner's father Shmuel \"Samuel\" Eisner was born March 6, 1886, in Kolomyia, Austria-Hungary, and was one of eleven children. He aspired to be an artist, and as a teenager painted murals for rich patrons and Catholic churches in Vienna. To avoid conscription in the army, he moved to New York before the outbreak of World War I. There he found getting work difficult as his English skills were poor. He made what living he could painting backdrops for vaudeville and the Jewish theater.\n\nEisner's mother, Fannie Ingber, was born to Jewish parents from Romania April 25, 1891, on a ship bound for the US. Her mother died on her tenth birthday, and was quickly followed by her father. An older stepsister thereafter raised her and kept her so busy with chores that she had little time for socializing or schooling; she did what she could later in life to keep knowledge of her illiteracy from her children.\n\nFamily introduced Shmuel and Fannie, who were distant relatives. They had three children: son Will Erwin, born on his father's birthday in 1917; son Julian, born February 3, 1921; and daughter Rhoda, born November 2, 1929.\n\nEisner was born in Brooklyn, New York City. He grew up poor, and the family moved frequently. Young Eisner often got into physical confrontations when subjected to antisemitism from his schoolmates. His family were not orthodox followers of Judaism; Eisner himself, while he prided his cultural background, turned against the religion when his family was denied entry to a synagogue over lack of money for admission.\n\nYoung Eisner was tall and of sturdy build, but lacked athletic skills. He was a voracious consumer of pulp magazines and film, including avant-garde films such as those by Man Ray. To his mother's disappointment, Eisner had his father's interest in art, and his father encouraged him by buying him art supplies.\n\nEisner's mother frequently berated his father for not providing the family a better income, as he went from one job to another. Without success he also tried his hand at such ventures as a furniture retailer and a coat factory. The family situation was especially dire following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 that marked the beginning of the Great Depression. In 1930, the situation was so desperate that Eisner's mother demanded that he, at thirteen, find some way to contribute to the family's income. He entered working life selling newspapers on street corners, a competitive job where the toughest boys fought for the best locations.\n\nEisner attended DeWitt Clinton High School. With influences that included the early 20th-century commercial artist J. C. Leyendecker, he drew for the school newspaper (\"The Clintonian\"), the literary magazine (\"The Magpie\") and the yearbook, and did stage design, leading him to consider doing that kind of work for theater. Upon graduation, he studied under Canadian artist George Brandt Bridgman (1864–1943) for a year at the Art Students League of New York. Contacts made there led to a position as an advertising writer-cartoonist for the \"New York American\" newspaper. Eisner also drew $10-a-page illustrations for pulp magazines, including \"Western Sheriffs and Outlaws\".\n\nIn 1936, high-school friend and fellow cartoonist Bob Kane, of future Batman fame, suggested that the 19-year-old Eisner try selling cartoons to the new comic book \"Wow, What A Magazine!\" \"Comic books\" at the time were tabloid-sized collections of comic strip reprints in color. By 1935, they had begun to include occasional new comic strip-like material. \"Wow\" editor Jerry Iger bought an Eisner adventure strip called \"Captain Scott Dalton\", an H. Rider Haggard-styled hero who traveled the world after rare artifacts. Eisner subsequently wrote and drew the pirate strip \"The Flame\" and the secret agent strip \"Harry Karry\" for \"Wow\" as well.\n\nEisner said that on one occasion a man who Eisner described as \"a Mob type straight out of Damon Runyon, complete with pinkie ring, broken nose, black shirt, and white tie, who claimed to have \"exclusive distribution rights for all Brooklyn\" asked Eisner to draw Tijuana bibles for $3 a page. Eisner said that he declined the offer; he described the decision as \"one of the most difficult moral decisions of my life\".\n\n\"Wow\" lasted four issues (cover-dated July–September and November 1936). After it ended, Eisner and Iger worked together producing and selling original comics material, anticipating that the well of available reprints would soon run dry, though their accounts of how their partnership was founded differ. One of the first such comic-book \"packagers\", their partnership was an immediate success, and the two soon had a stable of comics creators supplying work to Fox Comics, Fiction House, Quality Comics (for whom Eisner co-created such characters as Doll Man and Blackhawk), and others.\nTurning a profit of $1.50 a page, Eisner claimed that he \"got very rich before I was 22,\" later detailing that in Depression-era 1939 alone, he and Iger \"had split $25,000 between us\", a considerable amount for the time.\n\nAmong the studio's products was a self-syndicated Sunday comic strip, \"Hawks of the Sea\", that initially reprinted Eisner's old strip \"Wow, What A Magazine!\" feature \"The Flame\" and then continued it with new material. Eisner's original work even crossed the Atlantic, with Eisner drawing the new cover of the October 16, 1937 issue of Boardman Books' comic-strip reprint tabloid \"Okay Comics Weekly.\"\n\nIn 1939, Eisner was commissioned to create Wonder Man for Victor Fox, an accountant who had previously worked at DC Comics and was becoming a comic book publisher himself. Following Fox's instructions to create a Superman-type character, and using the pen name Willis, Eisner wrote and drew the first issue of \"Wonder Comics.\" Eisner said in interviews throughout his later life that he had protested the derivative nature of the character and story, and that when subpoenaed after National Periodical Publications, the company that would evolve into DC Comics, sued Fox, alleging Wonder Man was an illegal copy of Superman, Eisner testified that this was so, undermining Fox's case; Eisner even depicts himself doing so in his semi-autobiographical graphic novel \"The Dreamer\". However, a transcript of the proceeding, uncovered by comics historian Ken Quattro in 2010, indicates Eisner in fact supported Fox and claimed Wonder Man as an original Eisner creation.\n\nIn \"late '39, just before Christmas time,\" Eisner recalled in 1979, Quality Comics publisher Everett M. \"Busy\" Arnold \"came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom,\" In a 2004 interview, he elaborated on that meeting:\nEisner negotiated an agreement with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright \"The Spirit,\" but, \"Written down in the contract I had with 'Busy' Arnold — and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership — Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to 'Busy' Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership\". This would include the eventual backup features \"Mr. Mystic\" and \"Lady Luck\".\n\nSelling his share of their firm to Iger, who would continue to package comics as the S. M. Iger Studio and as Phoenix Features through 1955, for $20,000, Eisner left to create \"The Spirit.\" \"They gave me an adult audience\", Eisner said in 1997, \"and I wanted to write better things than superheroes. Comic books were a ghetto. I sold my part of the enterprise to my associate and then began The Spirit. They wanted an heroic character, a costumed character. They asked me if he'd have a costume. And I put a mask on him and said, 'Yes, he has a costume!'\"\n\n\"The Spirit\", an initially eight- and later seven-page urban-crimefighter series, ran with the initial backup features \"Mr. Mystic\" and \"Lady Luck\" in a 16-page Sunday supplement (colloquially called \"The Spirit Section\") that was eventually distributed in 20 newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies. It premiered June 2, 1940, and continued through 1952. Eisner has cited the Spirit story \"Gerhard Shnobble\" as a particular favorite, as it was one of his first attempts at injecting his personal point of view into the series.\n\nEisner was drafted into the U.S. Army in \"late '41, early '42\" and then \"had about another half-year which the government gave me to clean up my affairs before going off\" to fight in World War II. He was assigned to the camp newspaper at Aberdeen Proving Ground, where \"there was also a big training program there, so I got involved in the use of comics for training. ... I finally became a warrant officer, which involved taking a test – that way you didn't have to go through Officer Candidate School.\"\n\nEn route to Washington, D.C., he stopped at the Holabird Ordnance Depot in Baltimore, Maryland, where a mimeographed publication titled \"Army Motors\" was put together. \"Together with the people there ... I helped develop its format. I began doing cartoons – and we began fashioning a magazine that had the ability to talk to the G.I.s in their language. So I began to use comics as a teaching tool, and when I got to Washington, they assigned me to the business of teaching – or selling – preventive maintenance.\"\n\nEisner then created the educational comic strip and titular character \"Joe Dope\" for \"Army Motors\", and spent four years working in The Pentagon editing the ordnance magazine \"Firepower\" and doing \"all the general illustrations – that is, cartoons\" for \"Army Motors\". He continued to work on that and its 1950 successor magazine, \"PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly\" until 1971. Eisner also illustrated an official Army pamphlet in 1968 and 1969 called \"The M16A1 Rifle\" specifically for troops in Vietnam to help minimize the M-16 rifle's notorious early reliability problems with proper maintenance. Eisner's style helped to popularize these officially-distributed works in order to better educate soldiers on equipment maintenance.\n\nWhile Eisner's later graphic novels were entirely his own work, he had a studio working under his supervision on \"The Spirit\". In particular, letterer Abe Kanegson came up with the distinctive lettering style which Eisner himself would later imitate in his book-length works, and Kanegson would often rewrite Eisner's dialogue.\n\nEisner's most trusted assistant on \"The Spirit,\" however, was Jules Feiffer, later a renowned cartoonist, playwright and screenwriter in his own right. Eisner later said of their working methods \"You should hear me and Jules Feiffer going at it in a room. 'No, you designed the splash page for this one, then you wrote the ending — I came up with the idea for the story, and you did it up to this point, then I did the next page and this sequence here and...' And I'll be swearing up and down that 'he' wrote the ending on that one. We never agree\".\n\nSo trusted were Eisner's assistants that Eisner allowed them to \"ghost\" \"The Spirit\" from the time that he was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1942 until his return to civilian life in 1945. The primary wartime artists were the uncredited Lou Fine and Jack Cole, with future \"Kid Colt, Outlaw\" artist Jack Keller drawing backgrounds. Ghost writers included Manly Wade Wellman and William Woolfolk. The wartime ghosted stories have been reprinted in DC Comics' hardcover collections \"The Spirit Archives\" Vols. 5 to 11 (2001–2003), spanning July 1942 – December 1944.\n\nOn Eisner's return from service and resumption of his role in the studio, he created the bulk of the \"Spirit\" stories on which his reputation was solidified. The post-war years also saw him attempt to launch the comic-strip/comic-book series \"Baseball,\" \"John Law,\" \"Kewpies,\" and \"Nubbin the Shoeshine Boy;\" none succeeded, but some material was recycled into \"The Spirit\".\n\n\"The Spirit\" ceased publishing in 1952. During the 1960s and 1970s, various publishers reprinted the adventures often with covers by Eisner and with a few new stories from him.\n\nDuring his World War II military service, Eisner had introduced the use of comics for training personnel in the publication \"Army Motors\", for which he created the cautionary bumbling soldier Joe Dope, who illustrated various methods of preventive maintenance of various military equipment and weapons. In 1948, while continuing to do \"The Spirit\" and seeing television and other post-war trends eat at the readership base of newspapers, he formed the American Visuals Corporation in order to produce instructional materials for the government, related agencies, and businesses.\n\nOne of his longest-running jobs was \"PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly,\" a digest sized magazine with comic book elements that he started for the Army in 1951 and continued to work on until the 1970s with Klaus Nordling, Mike Ploog, and other artists. In addition, Eisner produced other military publications such as the graphic manual in 1969, \"The M-16A1 Rifle: Operation and Preventative Maintenance\", which was distributed along with cleaning kits to address serious reliability concerns with the M16 Rifle during the Vietnam War.\n\nOther clients of his Connecticut-based company included RCA Records, the Baltimore Colts NFL football team, and New York Telephone.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Eisner turned his attention to longer storytelling forms. \"A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories\" (Baronet Books, October 1978) is an early example of an American graphic novel, combining thematically linked short stories into a single square-bound volume. Eisner continued with a string of graphic novels that tell the history of New York's immigrant communities, particularly Jews, including \"The Building\", \"A Life Force\", \"Dropsie Avenue\" and \"To the Heart of the Storm\". He continued producing new books into his seventies and eighties, at an average rate of nearly one a year. Each of these books was done twice — once as a rough version to show editor Dave Schreiner, then as a second, finished version incorporating suggested changes.\n\nSome of his last work was the retelling in sequential art of novels and myths, including \"Moby-Dick\". In 2002, at the age of 85, he published \"Sundiata\", based on the part-historical, part-mythical stories of a West African king, \"The Lion of Mali\". \"Fagin the Jew\" is an account of the life of Dickens' character Fagin, in which Eisner tries to get past the stereotyped portrait of Fagin in \"Oliver Twist\".\n\nHis last graphic novel, \"The Plot: The Secret Story of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", an account of the making, and refutation, of the anti-semitic hoax \"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\", was completed shortly before his death and published in 2005.\n\nIn 2008, Will Eisner's \"The Spirit: A Pop-Up Graphic Novel\" was published, with Bruce Foster as paper engineer.\n\nIn his later years especially, Eisner was a frequent lecturer about the craft and uses of sequential art. He taught at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, where he published \"Will Eisner's Gallery\", a collection of work by his students and wrote two books based on these lectures, \"Comics and Sequential Art\" and \"Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative\", which are widely used by students of cartooning. In 2002, Eisner participated in the Will Eisner Symposium of the 2002 University of Florida Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels.\n\nEisner died January 3, 2005, in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, of complications from a quadruple bypass surgery performed December 22, 2004. DC Comics held a memorial service in Manhattan's Lower East Side, a neighborhood Eisner often visited in his work, at the Angel Orensanz Foundation on Norfolk Street.\n\nEisner was survived by his wife, Ann Weingarten Eisner, and their son, John. In the introduction to the 2001 reissue of \"A Contract with God\", Eisner revealed that the inspiration for the title story grew out of the 1970 death of his leukemia-stricken teenaged daughter, Alice, next to whom he is buried. Until then, only Eisner's closest friends were aware of his daughter's life and death.\n\nEisner has been recognized for his work with the National Cartoonists Society Comic Book Award for 1967, 1968, 1969, 1987 and 1988, as well as its Story Comic Book Award in 1979, and its Reuben Award in 1998.\n\nHe was inducted into the Academy of Comic Book Arts Hall of Fame in 1971, and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1987. The following year, the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards were established in his honor.\n\nin 1975, he received the second Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême.\n\nWith Jack Kirby, Robert Crumb, Harvey Kurtzman, Gary Panter, and Chris Ware, Eisner was among the artists honored in the exhibition \"Masters of American Comics\" at the Jewish Museum in New York City, from September 16, 2006 to January 28, 2007.\n\nOn the 94th anniversary of Eisner's birth, in 2011, Google used an image featuring the Spirit as its logo.\n\nIn 2015, Eisner was posthumously elected to the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame.\n\nComics by Will Eisner are archived in the James Branch Cabell Library of Virginia Commonwealth University.\nVCU's James Branch Cabell Library has served as the repository for the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards since 2005. Each year following Comic-Con, nominated and award-winning titles are donated to the library's Special Collections and Archives and made available to researchers and visitors. Approximately 1,000 comic books, graphic novels, archival editions, scholarly titles, and journals are included in the VCU library's expansive Comic Arts Collection.\n\nIn honor of Eisner’s centennial in 2017, Denis Kitchen and John Lind co-curated the largest retrospective exhibitions of Will Eisner’s original artwork, shown simultaneously at The Society of Illustrators in New York City and Le Musée de la Bande Dessinée in Angoulême, France. Both exhibitions were titled \"Will Eisner Centennial Celebration\" and collectively over 400 original pieces were included. A catalogue of the same name was released by Dark Horse Books and nominated for multiple Eisner Awards in 2018.\n\n\n\n"}
