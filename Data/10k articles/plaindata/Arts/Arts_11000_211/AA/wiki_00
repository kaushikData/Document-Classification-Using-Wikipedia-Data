Waistlines rose through the period for both men and women. Other notable fashions included full, slashed sleeves and tall or broad hats with brims. For men, hose disappeared in favour of breeches.\nThe silhouette, which was essentially close to the body with tight sleeves and a low, pointed waist to around 1615, gradually softened and broadened. Sleeves became very full, and in the 1620s and 1630s were often paned or slashed to show the voluminous sleeves of the shirt or chemise beneath.\n\nSpanish fashions remained very conservative. The ruff lingered longest in Spain and the Netherlands, but disappeared first for men and later for women in France and England.\n\nThe social tensions leading to the English Civil War were reflected in English fashion, with the elaborate French styles popular at the courts of James I and his son Charles I contrasting with the sober styles in sadd colours favoured by Puritans and exported to the early settlements of New England (see below).\n\nIn the early decades of the century, a trend among poets and artists to adopt a fashionable pose of melancholia is reflected in fashion, where the characteristic touches are dark colours, open collars, unbuttoned robes or doublets, and a generally disheveled appearance, accompanied in portraits by world-weary poses and sad expressions.\n\nFigured silks with elaborate pomegranate or artichoke patterns are still seen in this period, especially in Spain, but a lighter style of scrolling floral motifs, woven or embroidered, was popular, especially in England.\n\nThe great flowering of needlelace occurred in this period. Geometric reticella deriving from cutwork was elaborated into true needlelace or \"punto in aria\" (called in England \"point lace\"), which also reflected the popular scrolling floral designs.\n\nIn England, embroidered linen silk jackets fastened with ribbon ties were fashionable for both men and women from c. 1600–1620, as was reticella tinted with yellow starch. Overgowns with split sleeves (often trimmed with horizontal rows of braid) were worn by both men and women.\n\nFrom the 1620s, surface ornament fell out of fashion in favour of solid-colour satins, and functional ribbon bows or points became elaborate masses of rosettes and looped trim.\n\nIn England from the 1630s, under the influence of literature and especially court masques, Anthony van Dyck and his followers created a fashion for having one's portrait painted in exotic, historical or pastoral dress, or in simplified contemporary fashion with various scarves, cloaks, mantles, and jewels added to evoke a classic or romantic mood, and also to prevent the portrait appearing dated within a few years. These paintings are the progenitors of the fashion of the later 17th century for having one's portrait painted in \"undress\", and do not necessarily reflect clothing as it was actually worn.\n\nIn the early years of the new century, fashionable bodices had high necklines or extremely low, rounded necklines, and short wings at the shoulders. Separate closed cartwheel ruffs were sometimes worn, with the standing collar, supported by a small wire frame or \"supportasse\" used for more casual wear and becoming more common later. Long sleeves were worn with deep cuffs to match the ruff. The cartwheel ruff disappeared in fashionable England by 1613.\n\nBy the mid-1620s, styles were relaxing. Ruffs were discarded in favor of wired collars which were called \"rebatos\" in continental Europe and, later, wide, flat collars. By the 1630s and 1640s, collars were accompanied by kerchiefs similar to the linen kerchiefs worn by middle-class women in the previous century; often the collar and kerchief were trimmed with matching lace.\n\nBodices were long-waisted at the beginning of the century, but waistlines rose steadily to the mid-1630s before beginning to drop again. In the second decade of the 17th century, short tabs developed attached to the bottom of the bodice covering the \"bum-roll\" which supported the skirts. These tabs grew longer during the 1620s and were worn with a stomacher which filled the gap between the two front edges of the bodice. By 1640, the long tabs had almost disappeared and a longer, smoother figure became fashionable: The waist returned to normal height at the back and sides with a low point at the front.\n\nThe long, tight sleeves of the early 17th century grew shorter, fuller, and looser. A common style of the 1620s and 1630s was the virago sleeve, a full, slashed sleeve gathered into two puffs by a ribbon or other trim above the elbow.\n\nIn France and England, lightweight bright or pastel-coloured satins replaced dark, heavy fabrics. As in other periods, painters tended to avoid the difficulty of painting striped fabrics; it is clear from inventories that these were common.\nShort strings of pearls were fashionable.\n\nUnfitted gowns (called \"nightgowns\" in England) with long hanging sleeves, short open sleeves, or no sleeves at all were worn over the bodice and skirt and tied with a ribbon sash at the waist. In England of the 1610s and 1620s, a loose nightgown was often worn over an embroidered jacket called a \"waistcoat\" and a contrasting embroidered petticoat, without a farthingale. Black gowns were worn for the most formal occasions; they fell out of fashion in England in the 1630s in favour of gowns to match the bodice and petticoat, but remained an important item of clothing on the Continent.\n\nAt least in the Netherlands the open-fronted overgown or \"vlieger\" was strictly reserved for married women. Before marriage the \"bouwen\", \"a dress with a fitted bodice and a skirt that was closed all round\" was worn instead; it was known in England as a \"Dutch\" or \"round gown\".\n\nSkirts might be open in front to reveal an underskirt or petticoat until about 1630, or closed all around; closed skirts were sometimes carried or worn looped up to reveal a petticoat.\n\nCorsets were shorter to suit the new bodices, and might have a very stiff \"busk\" in the center front extending to the depth of the stomacher. Skirts were held in the proper shape by a padded roll or \"French farthingale\" holding the skirts out in a rounded shape at the waist, falling in soft folds to the floor. The drum or wheel farthingale was worn at the English court until the death of Anne of Denmark in 1619.\n\nTo about 1613, hair was worn feathered high over the forehead. Married women wore their hair in a linen coif or cap, often with lace trim. Tall hats like those worn by men were adopted for outdoor wear.\n\nIn a characteristic style of 1625–1650, hair was worn in loose waves to the shoulders on the sides, with the rest of the hair gathered or braided into a high bun at the back of the head. A short fringe or bangs might be worn with this style. Very fashionable married women abandoned the linen cap and wore their hair uncovered or with a hat.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinen shirts had deep cuffs. Shirt sleeves became fuller throughout the period. To the 1620s, a collar wired to stick out horizontally, called a \"whisk\", was popular. Other styles included an unstarched ruff-like collar and, later, a rectangular \"falling band\" lying on the shoulders. Pointed Van Dyke beards, named after the painter Anthony van Dyck, were fashionable, and men often grew a large, wide moustache, as well.\nDoublets were pointed and fitted close to the body, with tight sleeves, to about 1615. Gradually waistlines rose and sleeves became fuller, and both body and upper sleeves might be slashed to show the shirt beneath. By 1640, doublets were full and unfitted, and might be open at the front below the high waist to show the shirt.\n\nSleeveless leather jerkins were worn by soldiers and are seen in portraits, but otherwise the jerkin rapidly fell out of fashion for indoor wear.\n\nG\n\"Paned\" or \"pansied\" \"trunk hose\" or \"round hose\", padded hose with strips of fabric (\"panes\") over a full inner layer or lining, were worn early in the period, over \"cannions\", fitted hose that\nended above the knee. Trunk hose were longer than in the previous period, and were pear-shaped, with less fullness at the waist and more at mid-thigh.\n\n\"Slops\" or \"galligaskins\", loose hose reaching just below the knee, replaced all other styles of hose by the 1620s, and were now generally called breeches. Breeches might be fastened up the outer leg with buttons or buckles over a full lining.\n\nFrom 1600 to c. 1630, hose or breeches were fastened to doublets by means of ties or \"points\", short laces or ribbons pulled through matching sets of worked eyelets. Points were tied in bows at the waist and became more elaborate until they disappeared with the very short waisted doublets of the late 1630s. Decorated metal tips on points were called aiguillettes or aiglets, and those of the wealthy were made of precious metals set with pearls and other gemstones.\n\nSpanish breeches, rather stiff ungathered breeches, were also popular throughout the era.\n\nGowns were worn early in the period, but fell out of fashion in the 1620s.\n\nShort cloaks or capes, usually hip-length, often with sleeves, were worn by fashionable men, usually slung artistically over the left shoulder, even indoors; a fashion of the 1630s matched the cape fabric to the breeches and its lining to the doublet. Long cloaks were worn for inclement weather.\n\nEarly in the period, hair was worn collar-length and brushed back from the forehead; very fashionable men wore a single long strand of hair called a lovelock over one shoulder. Hairstyles grew longer through the period, and long curls were fashionable by the late 1630s and 1640s, pointing toward the ascendance of the wig in the 1660s.\n\nPointed beards and wide mustaches were fashionable.\n\nTo about 1620, the fashionable hat was the capotain, with a tall conical crown rounded at the top and a narrow brim. By the 1630s, the crown was shorter and the brim was wider, often worn \"cocked\" or pinned up on one side and decorated with a mass of ostrich plumes.\n\nClose-fitting caps called coifs or \"biggins\" were worn only by young children and old men under their hats or alone indoors.\n\n\n\nFlat shoes were worn to around 1610, when a low heel became popular. The ribbon tie over the instep that had appeared on late sixteenth century shoes grew into elaborate lace or ribbon rosettes called \"shoe roses\" that were worn by the most fashionable men and women.\n\nBackless slippers called \"pantofles\" were worn indoors.\n\nBy the 1620s, heeled boots became popular for indoor as well as outdoor wear.\nThe boots themselves were usually turned down below the knee; boot tops became wider until the \"bucket-top\" boot associated with \"The Three Musketeers\" appeared in the 1630s. Spurs straps featured decorative butterfly-shaped \"spur leathers\" over the instep.\n\nWooden clogs or pattens were worn outdoors over shoes and boots to keep the high heels from sinking into soft dirt.\n\nStockings had elaborate \"clocks\" or embroidery at the ankles early in the period. \"Boothose\" of stout linen were worn under boots to protect fine knitted stockings; these could be trimmed with lace.\n\nToddler boys wore gowns or skirts and doublets until they were \"breeched\".\n\nIn Protestant and Catholic countries, attempts were made to simplify and reform the extravagances of dress. Louis XIII of France issued sumptuary laws in 1629 and 1633 that prohibited lace, gold trim and lavish embroidery for all but the highest nobility and restricting puffs, slashes and bunches of ribbon. The effects of this reform effort are depicted in a series of popular engravings by Abraham Bosse.\n\nPuritans advocated a conservative form of fashionable attire, characterized by sadd colors and modest cuts. Gowns with low necklines were filled in with high-necked smocks and wide collars. Married women covered their hair with a linen cap, over which they might wear a tall black hat. Men and women avoided bright colours, shiny fabrics and over-ornamentation.\n\nContrary to popular belief, most Puritans and Calvinists did not wear black for everyday, especially in England, Scotland and colonial America. Black dye was expensive, faded quickly and black clothing was reserved for the most formal occasions (including having one's portrait painted), for elders in a community and for those of higher rank. Richer puritans, like their Dutch Calvinist contemporaries, probably did wear it often but in silk, often patterned. Typical colours for most were brown, murrey (mulberry, a brownish-maroon), dull greens and tawny colours. Wool and linen were preferred over silks and satins, though Puritan women of rank wore modest amounts of lace and embroidery as appropriate to their station, believing that the various ranks of society were divinely ordained and should be reflected even in the most modest dress. William Perkins wrote \"...that apparel is necessary for Scholar, the Tradesman, the Countryman, the Gentleman; which serveth not only to defend their bodies from cold, but which belongs also to the place, degree, calling, and condition of them all\" (\"Cases of Conscience\", 1616).\n\nSome Puritans rejected the long, curled hair as effeminate and favoured a shorter fashion which led to the nickname Roundheads for adherents of the English Parliamentary party but the taste for lavish or simple dress cut across both parties in the English Civil War.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2147563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2147563", "title": "A Prairie Home Companion (film)", "text": "A Prairie Home Companion (film)\n\nA Prairie Home Companion is a 2006 American ensemble comedy film directed by Robert Altman and is his final film. The film is a fictional representation of behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running public radio show of the same name. The film received mostly positive reviews and was a moderate box office success on its small budget.\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast including Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Tommy Lee Jones, Woody Harrelson, Lily Tomlin, Garrison Keillor, Virginia Madsen, John C. Reilly, and Lindsay Lohan.\n\nA long-running live radio show is in danger of being canceled by new owners of the company that holds both radio station \"WLT\" and the theater where the show is broadcast. The film takes place on the night of the show's last performance. The show has two visitors: an angel calling herself Asphodel (Virginia Madsen) comes to comfort the people who work on the show and to escort one of them to the afterlife, while \"the Axeman\" (Tommy Lee Jones), a representative of the new owners, arrives to judge whether the show should be canceled. He makes it clear that the show is not what he considers modern popular programming, and though he too is escorted by the angel, the show is shut down anyway. In an epilogue at the end of the film the former cast members are reunited at Mickey's Diner. Their conversation pauses as they are joined by Asphodel.\n\nTo receive insurance for the shoot, Robert Altman had to hire Paul Thomas Anderson as a \"backup\" director to observe filming at all times and be prepared to take over for Altman in case of his incapacity. Using the working title \"The Last Show\", principal photography for the film began on June 29, 2005, at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota (the usual venue for the radio show). Filming ended on July 28, 2005.\nBecause the Fitzgerald is a rather small building, other stage theaters in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region had been considered as stand-ins, but in the end, the necessary film equipment was crammed into the structure. The lack of space led to the basement also being used for some sets. Set design had to make the show more visually interesting, and fake dressing rooms were used in the film. The movie's production designer noted that Keillor's actual dressing room is \"about the size of a very, very small bathroom.\" \n\nMickey's Diner, a downtown St. Paul landmark, is also featured in the film.\n\nOn November 1, 2005, the \"Star Tribune\" reported that an early screening in New York City for film distributors resulted in a heavy bidding war. Picturehouse bought the rights, and company president Bob Berney, \"aiming to capitalize on the name recognition of the 31-year-old radio program, recommended that the title revert to \"A Prairie Home Companion\". 'At the screening, Garrison said that to broaden the film's appeal, they were thinking about changing the name to \"Savage Love\", so we may have an argument there,' Berney said.\"\n\n\"A Prairie Home Companion\" opened the 2006 South by Southwest film festival on March 10, then premiered in St. Paul, on May 3, 2006, at the Fitzgerald Theater, which had projection and sound equipment brought in for that purpose. The film's stars arrived in ten horse-drawn carriages. Brian Williams of \"NBC Nightly News\" anchored his newscast from neighboring Minneapolis, Minnesota, that night so that he would be able to attend.\n\nCritics' general reaction to the film was favorable, and it garnered an 82% fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars, saying, \"What a lovely film this is, so gentle and whimsical, so simple and profound\", and later added the film to his \"Great Movies\" list.\n\nMichael Medved (himself a radio host) gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, \"The entertainment value stands somewhere between thin and nonexistent\" and \"[it may be] the worst movie ever made that pooled the talents of four (count ‘em – four!) Oscar winners\".\n\nDesson Thomson from \"The Washington Post\" fell in between, saying in a review headlined \"Honey, You Could Ask for More\" (a reference to the theme song of the radio show and film) that while the movie had its strengths, it was weaker than it should have been.\n\nMeryl Streep won the Best Supporting Actress Award from the National Society of Film Critics for her role; Altman was also posthumously nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Director.\n\nThe film had a successful limited release in the United States and grossed $20,338,609 domestically and $25,978,442 worldwide.\n\nNew Line released a soundtrack album featuring a mixture of old time music classics and contemporary songs written by Keillor.\n\nA Prairie Home Companion is the soundtrack the 2006 film \"A Prairie Home Companion\".

{"id": "34149316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34149316", "title": "Adoration of the Shepherds (Le Nain)", "text": "Adoration of the Shepherds (Le Nain)\n\nThe Adoration of the Shepherds by the Le Nain Brothers is in the National Gallery in London. The painting dates from about 1640, and is relatively unusual as a religious subject or history painting in their \"oeuvre\"; they are best known for genre painting, especially groups of peasants. As with most of the works of Antoine (c 1600–1648), Louis (c. 1603?–1648) and Mathieu (1607–1677) Le Nain, it is not possible to establish which brother, or combination of brothers, painted it. This painting is unsigned, but when they signed their works, from 1641 to 1648, it was simply as \"Lenain\".\n\nThe painting is in oil on canvas and in good condition, with minor losses; it measures . The \"Adoration of the Shepherds\" is a very common subject in the Nativity of Jesus in art, and the composition is an arrangement of the conventional components, including the Holy Family, the ox and ass or donkey, angels, and three shepherds, two old and one young. One shepherd and an angel are glancing out to the viewer's left, and it has been suggested that they have seen the approach of the Biblical Magi, which may have been the subject of a matching painting. There are \"pentimenti\" showing what appears to have been the original composition: on the wall above the lefthand angel dim traces of a head of the Virgin can be seen, slightly bowed to the left matching Joseph just to her right. On the donkey the trace of a curved rein can be seen, starting where the white chest meets the foreleg; the whole animal may originally have been lower. Michael Levey describes the treatment of the scene as \"partly 'realistic' and humbly rustic and partly idealized\", and the National Gallery detect the influence of Orazio Gentileschi, who had worked in Paris, in the figures of Mary and Joseph, and the ass.\n\nDates in the 1630s have been suggested, and also that the painting is by Mathieu, or Louis. Elements of the architectural setting have been compared to those in a painting by Laurent de La Hyre in the Hermitage Museum dated 1638, \"Mercury confiding Bacchus to the Nymphs\" (in reverse), and the ass is very similar to that in \"The Milkmaid's Family\", also in the Hermitage, a Le Nain painting thought to date to 1641. There is an \"Adoration\" attributed to the brothers, and at least in a similar style, in the National Gallery of Ireland, which shares some aspects of the composition. Another, more realist, \"Adoration of the Shepherds\" in the Louvre was long attributed to the Le Nains, but is now given to Jean Michelin and dated 1659.\n\nAs with most Le Nain paintings, the original commissioner is not known, nor whether it was intended for a church or other religious institution, or a domestic setting. It first appears in England in the 1770s. Possibly it was the painting of the subject sold at Christie's 7 February 1771, as by Le Nain (lot 21), realizing the good price of £42, and/or that sold on 20 March 1773, again at Christie's, this time for only £14 4s 6d (lot 85, as \"Le Naine\"). It was certainly at Blenheim Palace by 1777, now attributed to Luca Giordano, in the collection of George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough. It remained in the Marlborough collection until the epic sales in the 1880s of the 8th Duke, when it was once again sold at Christie's on 7 August 1886 (lot 652, £52 10s), bought by a dealer. It was later bought by Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk and is recorded as hanging in the \"Prince's Bedroom\" at Arundel Castle in 1902, still as a Giordano. In 1962 it was sold by the 16th Duke to the National Gallery, as a Le Nain. It is catalogued as NG 6331, and hangs in Room 18.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29429251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29429251", "title": "Arbit Blatas", "text": "Arbit Blatas\n\nArbit Blatas (1908–1999), born Nicolai Arbitblatas, was an artist and sculptor of Lithuanian–Jewish descent.\n\nBorn in Kovno (then in the Russian Empire) on 19 November 1908, Arbit Blatas was a precocious talent who began exhibiting in his native country at the age of 15. He left for Paris and, at the age of 21, became the youngest member of the School of Paris. When Blatas was 24, the Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume in Paris first acquired some of his paintings; he had already become a colleague and friend of many of the great figures of the Paris art world, such as Vlaminck, Soutine, Picasso, Utrillo, Braque, Zadkine, Léger and Derain. He was to paint and sculpt them all, as well as Bonnard, Vuillard, Matisse, Dufy, Van Dongen, Cocteau, Marquet and many others. His 30 portraits in oil and bronzes are considered a unique document of the painters and sculptors of that dynamic period in 20th-century French painting..\n\nIn the 1930s, Blatas exhibited in London and New York, as well as in his adoptive home of Paris. Fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe in 1941 for the United States, Blatas became an American citizen. After the war, Blatas divided his life between New York and France; in 1947, he was elected a life member of the Salon d'Automne, in the latter country. His life-size bronze of his colleague and friend Chaim Soutine, created in 1967, was highly admired by André Malraux. In 1987, the City of Paris installed the statue in Montparnasse and conferred on Blatas the Médaille de Vermeil. A life-size statue of another close friend and colleague, Jacques Lipchitz, now stands in the garden of the Hotel de Ville. In 1978, Arbit Blatas was named Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur by the French Government for his contribution to French art as an outstanding member of the School of Paris, and in 1994 was promoted to the rank of Officier de la Légion d'Honneur.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the Holocaust – a theme that had hitherto lain dormant for the artist – burst forth in Blatas' work and remained a major theme for the rest of his life. His personal connection to the Holocaust was profound—his parents were deported from Lithuania in 1941 and his mother died in the Stutthof concentration camp while his father managed to survive the Dachau concentration camp. After the war, Blatas returned to France to bring his father back with him to the United States.\n\nBlatas memorialized the Holocaust in many major works. His drawings appeared in the 1978 American television series \"Holocaust\" and formed the basis for four public memorials, consisting of seven powerful bas-reliefs, known as The Monument of the Holocaust, on permanent display in four countries: Italy France, the United States and Lithuania. In Italy, in the ghetto di Venezia in Venice are located two big bas-reliefs: one in memory of the Shoah in general, and the second one dedicated to the Venetian Jews who were deported between 1943 and 1944. 246 names written on a wooden wall behind a bas relief with a train. Both the monument were made in the '90.\n\nThe first edition of this monument was installed in the historic Venetian Ghetto on April 25, 1980, on the occasion of \"Liberazione\", the national holiday celebrating liberation from Benito Mussolini's government. On that occasion, then-Mayor Mario Rigo decorated Blatas with the Venezia Riconoscente. On September 19, 1993, in the same Ghetto, then-President of Italy Oscar Scalfaro honoured Blatas by dedicating his sculpture \"The Last Train\", a monument honouring the 50th anniversary of the deportation of the Jews from the Venetian Ghetto. The distinguished Italian art historian Enzo di Martini wrote of Blatas' Monument of the Holocaust: \"In complete contrast to his paintings, these bronzes are hammered and chiselled in anger and tragedy.\"\n\nThe second edition of The Monument of the Holocaust was dedicated at the Mémorial du Martyr Juif Inconnu in Paris on April 23, 1981. The third edition was placed at One Dag Hammarskjold Plaza on April 25, 1982 by the Anti-Defamation League, across from the United Nations in New York. In 2009, this edition was installed permanently at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York City. In 2003, the fourth and final edition of this series of sculptures was donated posthumously by his widow as part of the consecration of the memorial at the Ninth Fort in Blatas' native Kaunas, Lithuania, the location from which Blatas' parents were deported in 1941.\n\nTwo other major subjects became leitmotifs in Blatas' work: his great friend Marcel Marceau and \"The Threepenny Opera\". Both inspired the artist in paintings, sculpture, and lithography. Marceau's portraits range from large portraits to small-scale studies, to sculptures, to sets of lithographs that capture the mime in mid-air. Blatas attended the world première of \"The Threepenny Opera\" in Berlin in 1928; the musical theatre work by Kurt Weill and Berthold Brecht inspired Blatas for the next 70 years. His canon of work depicting scenes and characters from \"The Threepenny Opera\" includes 18 portraits, 10 sculptures, several large canvases and sets of color and black-and-white lithographs. The preface by Lotte Lenya, Weill's widow, (published in 'The Art of an Opera' (NYC) June 1962) to the first edition of Threepenny lithographs, pays tribute to Blatas' understanding of the work:\n\nIn 1984, \"The Threepenny Opera\" exhibition was displayed at Venice's Teatro Goldoni. This collection then moved on to the Museum of the City of New York and the Goethe Institute's Toronto branch in 1986. In May 1994, the Grosvenor Gallery in London presented the exhibition called \"Arbit Blatas and his World of Music and Theatre.\" In 2000 and 2001, respectively, the entire \"Threepenny Opera\" collection appeared as part of the Kurt Weill Centenary celebrations at Belmont University, Nashville, Tennessee, and the Leubsdorf Gallery, Hunter College, New York.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Blatas designed scenery and costumes for nine international opera productions in collaboration with his wife, the renowned mezzo-soprano, Regina Resnik, as stage director. These productions included \"Elektra\" (Teatro La Fenice, Venice; Teatro São Carlos, Lisbon; Opéra du Rhin, Strasbourg); \"Carmen\" (Hamburg State Opera); \"Salome\" (Teatro São Carlos); \"Falstaff\" (Teatr Wielki, Warsaw; Teatro la Fenice; Teatro São Carlos; Festival of Madrid); \"The Queen of Spades\" (Vancouver Opera; Sydney Opera House); and \"The Bear\" and \"The Medium\" (Teatro São Carlos).\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw major exhibitions of Blatas' work, including several devoted to the School of Paris. In Venice, in 1982, the School of Paris portraits became a major exhibition at the Church of San Samuele under the joint auspices of the then-Mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac, and the then-Mayor of Venice, Mario Rigo. Musée Bourdelle offered the first major exhibition in Paris of the portrait collection in 1986. In 1990, the entire collection of the School of Paris, was shown at the Musée des Années Trente in Boulogne-Billancourt, which subsequently acquired the entire collection now permanently installed in galleries dedicated to Blatas. In 1996, the Eastlake Gallery of New York presented Blatas in an exhibition entitled \"Aspects of Venice.\" In 1997, the Beacon Hill Gallery, also in New York, presented a retrospective show – the last major exhibition of the artist's work in his lifetime.\n\nActive into his 90th year, the artist died on April 27, 1999 at his home in New York City. From September 2008 through July 2009, the 100th anniversary of the birth of Arbit Blatas was celebrated in \"Arbit Blatas: A Centenary Exhibition\" at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. This exhibition brought together all the major themes and media of Blatas' body of work for the first time: French and Venetian landscapes, music and theatre subjects in painting, sculptures and lithographs, the School of Paris in sculpture, and scenic designs. The Holocaust was honoured in the fourth edition of Monument of the Holocaust and four towering, major paintings.\n\nBlatas' vivid colours and joie de vivre extends through his entire canon of paintings: landscapes, portraits and still lifes. The French art critic, Jean Bouret, summed the artist up this way: \"He is color, his palette is color, exuberant and sensual, as is the man.\" Throughout his life, Arbit Blatas received many awards and honours.

The agent functions by attempting to sell the works of an artist, or to otherwise find lucrative opportunities for the artist. The two parties have a contract worked out, where the agent takes a cut of the sales from any and all works, which may vary, depending on the relationship. Typically the range for a successful non-gallery sale is between 15% and 35% to the agent of the final sales price when the agent is responsible for bringing a buyer. Arts sales made at a Gallery are often split 50/50 between the artist or Trust and the Gallery.\n\nIt is in the art agent's best interests to sell the works of the artist. The relationship is seen as a win-win for both the artist and the agent.\n\nMany unrecognized artists, no matter how talented, may find it hard to find an art agent willing to sell their works. Art agents select their artist not based on their talent but the likelihood their works will sell. \n"}

UBS, the world’s biggest wealth manager and sponsor of Art Basel, announced in April 2009 that it would close its 11-year-old art advisory division. In contrast, some start-up art financiers have stepped into the vacuum created by the departing banks, such as former corporate raider Asher Edelman, who founded ArtAssure Ltd. in 2010 to provide liquidity to the art market in the form of non-recourse art loans and unique and legally-untested methods of auction guarantees.\n\nIn September 2008 the Museum of American Finance held a panel discussion on financing to support art acquisitions.\n\nIn April 2012, the art lending market was roughly US $7 billion.\n\nIn late July 2009, \"The New York Times\" reported that the art finance firm Art Capital Group sued photographer Annie Leibovitz in the New York State Supreme Court for non-payment on a $24 million loan, seeking damages through access to her home, negatives, and all her intellectual property rights in her photographs. In March, 2010, Colony Capital concluded a new financing and marketing agreement with Leibovitz, paying off Art Capital and removing or reducing the risks of Leibovitz losing her artistic and real estate assets.\n\nIt has been noted that art lending practices can contribute to and enable art crime by acting as a form of private banking for the art world and as such, suffer from a lack of transparency and encourage high risk borrowing behavior, as occurred with Leibovitz.

It is a valuable tool to identify and document past owners of a property and serves as a property’s historical ownership timeline. The \"chain\" runs from the present owner back to the original owner of the property. In situations where documentation of ownership is important, it is often necessary to reconstruct the chain of title. To facilitate this, a record of title documents may be maintained by a registry office or civil law notary.\n\nReal estate is one field where the chain of title has considerable significance. Various registration systems, such as the Torrens title system, have been developed to track the ownership of individual pieces of real property. In real estate transactions in the United States, insurance companies issue title insurance based upon the chain of title to the property when it is transferred. Title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records. In other cases, the chain of title is established by an abstract of title, sometimes, although not always, certified by an attorney. In the United States, some holders of mortgage debt may be unable to establish chain of title, despite the fact that clear chain of title can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed. Widespread lack of clarity in chain of title results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling of mortgage liabilities without registration of changes of ownership with local governments. US states have objected and even sued over this practice.\n\nIn the motion picture industry, the chain of title involves the series of documentation which establishes proprietary rights in a film. The chain also applies to compilations in other fields, where many people have contributed to the project, thus acquiring authorship rights, or where materials were culled from many sources. Chain of title is extremely important to film purchasers and to film distributors, as it establishes the veracity of the owner's proprietary rights (or rights under license) in the intellectual property in a film, book or encyclopedia.\n\nChain of title documentation can include:\n\n\nSpecialist organizations engage in the production of copyright property reports for motion picture studios, which cover original or unexploited works, and include the results of United States Copyright Office screening searches, author claimant searches, registration renewal searches and assignment searches.

Extending Computer-Aided Design (CAD), automated design and Computer-Automated Design (CAutoD) are more concerned with a broader range of applications, such as automotive engineering, civil engineering, composite material design, control engineering, dynamic system identification, financial systems, industrial equipment, mechatronic systems, steel construction, structural optimisation, and the invention of novel systems.\n\nThe concept of CAutoD perhaps first appeared in 1963, in the IBM Journal of Research and Development, where a computer program was written.\n\nMore recently, traditional CAD simulation is seen to be transformed to CAutoD by biologically-inspired machine learning or search techniques such as evolutionary computation, including swarm intelligence algorithms.\n\nTo meet the ever-growing demand of quality and competitiveness, iterative physical prototyping is now often replaced by 'digital prototyping' of a 'good design', which aims to meet multiple objectives such as maximised output, energy efficiency, highest speed and cost-effectiveness. The design problem concerns both finding the best design within a known range (i.e., through 'learning' or 'optimisation') and finding a new and better design beyond the existing ones (i.e., through creation and invention). This is equivalent to a search problem in an almost certainly, multidimensional (multivariate), multi-modal space with a single (or weighted) objective or multiple objectives.\n\nUsing single-objective CAutoD as an example, if the objective function, either as a cost function formula_1, or inversely, as a fitness function formula_2, where\n\nis differentiable under practical constraints in the multidimensional space, the design problem may be solved analytically. Finding the parameter sets that result in a zero first-order derivative and that satisfy the second-order derivative conditions would reveal all local optima. Then comparing the values of the performance index of all the local optima, together with those of all boundary parameter sets, would lead to the global optimum, whose corresponding 'parameter' set will thus represent the best design. However, in practice, the optimization usually involves multiple objectives and the matters involving derivatives are lot more complex.\n\nIn practice, the objective value may be noisy or even non-numerical, and hence its gradient information may be unreliable or unavailable. This is particularly true when the problem is multi-objective. At present, many designs and refinements are mainly made through a manual trial-and-error process with the help of a CAD simulation package. Usually, such \"a posteriori\" learning or adjustments need to be repeated many times until a ‘satisfactory’ or ‘optimal’ design emerges.\n\nIn theory, this adjustment process can be automated by computerised search, such as exhaustive search. As this is an exponential algorithm, it may not deliver solutions in practice within a limited period of time.\n\nOne approach to virtual engineering and automated design is evolutionary computation such as evolutionary algorithms.\n\nTo reduce the search time, the biologically-inspired evolutionary algorithm (EA) can be used instead, which is a (non-deterministic) polynomial algorithm. The EA based multi-objective \"search team\" can be interfaced with an existing CAD simulation package in a batch mode. The EA encodes the design parameters (encoding being necessary if some parameters are non-numerical) to refine multiple candidates through parallel and interactive search. In the search process, 'selection' is performed using 'survival of the fittest' \"a posteriori\" learning. To obtain the next 'generation' of possible solutions, some parameter values are exchanged between two candidates (by an operation called 'crossover') and new values introduced (by an operation called 'mutation'). This way, the evolutionary technique makes use of past trial information in a similarly intelligent manner to the human designer.\n\nThe EA based optimal designs can start from the designer's existing design database or from an initial generation of candidate designs obtained randomly. A number of finally evolved top-performing candidates will represent several automatically optimized digital prototypes.\n\nThere are websites that demonstrate interactive evolutionary algorithms for design. EndlessForms.com allows you to evolve 3D objects online and have them 3D printed. PicBreeder.org allows you to do the same for 2D images.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32827853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32827853", "title": "Critical reputation of Arthur Sullivan", "text": "Critical reputation of Arthur Sullivan\n\nThe critical reputation of the British composer Arthur Sullivan has fluctuated markedly in the 150 years since he came to prominence. At first, critics regarded him as a potentially great composer of serious masterpieces, the long-awaited great English composer. When Sullivan made a series of popular successes in comic operas with the librettist W.S. Gilbert, Victorian critics generally praised the operettas but reproached Sullivan for not concentrating on composing solemn choral works and grand opera instead. Immediately after Sullivan's death, his reputation was attacked by critics who condemned him for not taking part in what they conceived of as an \"English musical renaissance\". By the latter part of the 20th century, Sullivan's music was being critically reassessed, beginning with the first book devoted to a study of his music, \"The Music of Arthur Sullivan\" by Gervase Hughes (1960).\n\nWhen the young Arthur Sullivan returned to England after his studies in Leipzig, critics were struck by his potential as a composer. His incidental music to \"The Tempest\" received an acclaimed premiere at the Crystal Palace on 5 April 1862. The \"Athenaeum\" wrote:\n\nHis \"Irish Symphony\" of 1866 won similarly enthusiastic praise: \"The symphony...is not only by far the most noticeable composition that has proceeded from Mr. Sullivan's pen, but the best musical work, if judged only by the largeness of its form and the number of beautiful thoughts it contains, for a long time produced by any English composer.\" But as Arthur Jacobs notes, \"The first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for Sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last.\" A comment that may be taken as typical of those that would follow the composer throughout his career was that \"Sullivan's unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation.\"\n\nSullivan was also occasionally cited for a lack of diligence. For instance, of his early oratorio, \"The Prodigal Son\", his teacher, John Goss, wrote:\nBy the mid-1870s, Sullivan had turned his attention mainly to works for the theatre, for which he was generally admired. For instance, after the first performance of \"Trial by Jury\" (1875), the \"Times\" said that \"It seems, as in the great Wagnerian operas, as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain.\" But serious music critics began to express disapproval. The music critic Peter Gammond writes of \"misapprehensions and prejudices, delivered to our door by the Victorian firm Musical Snobs Ltd. ... frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of Art.\" By the time \"The Sorcerer\" appeared in 1877, there were charges that Sullivan was wasting his talents in comic opera:\n\nImplicit in these comments was the view that comic opera, no matter how carefully crafted, was an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio. The \"Athenaeum's\" review of \"The Martyr of Antioch\" expressed a similar complaint: \"It might be wished that in some portions Mr Sullivan had taken a loftier view of his theme, but at any rate he has written some most charming music, and orchestration equal, if not superior, to any that has ever proceeded from the pen of an English musician. And, further, it is an advantage to have the composer of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" occupying himself with a worthier form of art.\"\n\nThe operas with Gilbert themselves, however, garnered Sullivan high praise from the theatre reviewers. For instance, \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote, \"The composer has risen to his opportunity, and we are disposed to account \"Iolanthe\" his best effort in all the Gilbertian series.\" Similarly, the \"Theatre\" would say that \"the music of \"Iolanthe\" is Dr Sullivan's \"chef d'oeuvre\". The quality throughout is more even, and maintained at a higher standard, than in any of his earlier works... In every respect \"Iolanthe\" sustains Dr Sullivan's reputation as the most spontaneous, fertile, and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced.\" Sullivan received honorary doctorates of music from the University of Cambridge in 1876, and Oxford in 1879.\n\nAfter Sullivan was knighted in 1883, serious music critics renewed the charge that the composer was squandering his talent. The \"Musical Review\" of that year wrote:\n\nIn \"Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", Sir George Grove, who was an old friend of Sullivan's, recognised the artistry in the Savoy Operas while urging the composer to bigger and better things: \"Surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice, orchestra, and stage effect—master, too, of so much genuine sentiment—may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest.\"\n\nThe premiere of \"The Golden Legend\" at the Leeds Festival in 1886 finally brought Sullivan the acclaim for a serious work that he had previously lacked. For instance, the critic of the \"Daily Telegraph\" wrote that \"a greater, more legitimate and more undoubted triumph than that of the new cantata has not been achieved within my experience.\" \"The Observer\" hailed it as a \"triumph of English art\". Similarly, Louis Engel in \"The World\" called it: \"one of the greatest creations we have had for many years. Original, bold, inspired, grand in conception, in execution, in treatment, it is a composition which will make an \"epoch\" and which will carry the name of its composer higher on the wings of fame and glory. The effect it produced at rehearsal was enormous. The effect of the public performance was unprecedented.\" Hopes for a new departure were evident in the \"Daily Telegraph\"'s review of \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", Sullivan's most serious opera to that point:\nThe advance that the \"Daily Telegraph\" was looking for would come with Sullivan's only grand opera, \"Ivanhoe\" (1891), which opened to largely favourable reviews, but attracted some significant negative ones. For instance, J. A. Fuller Maitland wrote in \"The Times\" that the opera's \"best portions rise so far above anything else that Sir Arthur Sullivan has given to the world, and have such force and dignity, that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing, and the brevity of the concerted solo parts.\" In her 1891 essay \"Arthur Seymour Sullivan\", Florence A. Marshall reviewed Sullivan's music up to that time, concluding that Sullivan was torn between his interests in comedy and tragedy. She wrote that he was \"no dreamy idealist, but thoroughly practical ... apprehending and assimilating all the tendencies in the life of society around him, and knowing how to turn them all to account ... music is, in his hands, a plastic material, into which he can mold anything. His mastery of form and of instrumentation is absolute, and he wields them without the slightest semblance of effort. His taste is ... unerring; his perceptions of the keenest; his sense of humor infectious and irresistible.\"\n\nIn the 1890s, Sullivan's successes were fewer and farther between than earlier in his career. The ballet \"Victoria and Merrie England\" (1898) won praise from most critics:\nAfter \"The Rose of Persia\" (1899), the \"Daily Telegraph\" said that \"The musician is once again absolutely himself\", while the \"Musical Times\" opined that \"it is music that to hear once is to want to hear again and again.\"\n\nIn 1899, Sullivan composed a popular song, \"The Absent-Minded Beggar\", to a text by Rudyard Kipling, donating the proceeds of the sale to \"the wives and children of soldiers and sailors\" on active service in the Boer War. Fuller Maitland disapproved in \"The Times\", but Sullivan himself asked a friend, \"Did the idiot expect the words to be set in cantata form, or as a developed composition with symphonic introduction, contrapuntal treatment, etc.?\"\n\nAlthough the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive Sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible, he was, nevertheless, \"the nation's \"de facto\" composer laureate\". Sullivan was considered the natural candidate to compose a \"Te Deum\" for the end of the Boer War, which he duly completed, despite serious ill-health; it was performed posthumously. Gian Andrea Mazzucato wrote this glowing summary of Sullivan's career in \"The Musical Standard\" of 16 December 1899:\n\nAfter Sullivan's death, Sir George Grove wrote, \"Form and symmetry he seems to possess by instinct; rhythm and melody clothe everything he touches; the music shows not only sympathetic genius, but sense, judgement, proportion, and a complete absence of pedantry and pretension; while the orchestration is distinguished by a happy and original beauty hardly surpassed by the greatest masters.\". His obituary in \"The Times\" called him England's \"most conspicuous composer ... the musician who had such power to charm all classes. ... The critic and the student found new beauties at every fresh hearing. What ... set Sullivan in popular esteem far above all the other English composers of his day was the tunefulness of his music, that quality in it by which ... [it] was immediately recognized as a joyous contribution to the gaiety of life. ... Sullivan’s name stood as a synonym for music in England.\" The obituary also stated: \"Many who are able to appreciate classical music regret that Sir Arthur Sullivan did not aim consistently at higher things, that he set himself to rival Offenbach and Lecocq instead of competing on a level of high seriousness with such musicians as Sir Hubert Parry and Professor Stanford. If he had followed this path, he might have enrolled his name among the great composers of all time. ... That Sir Arthur Sullivan could aim high and succeed he proved by \"The Golden Legend\" and by a good deal of \"Ivanhoe\"\".\n\nOver the next decade, however, Sullivan's reputation sank considerably among music critics. In 1901, shortly after the composer's death, Fuller Maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of most of the obituaries, citing the composer's failure to live up to the early praise of his \"Tempest\" music:\n\nEdward Elgar, to whom Sullivan had been particularly kind, rose to Sullivan's defence, branding Fuller Maitland's obituary \"the shady side of musical criticism ... that foul unforgettable episode.\" Fuller Maitland was later discredited when it was shown that he had falsified the facts, inventing a banal lyric, passing it off as genuine and condemning Sullivan for supposedly setting such inanity. In 1929 Fuller Maitland admitted that he had been wrong in earlier years to dismiss Sullivan's comic operas as \"ephemeral\". In his \"History of Music in England\" (1907) Ernest Walker, was even more damning of Sullivan than Fuller Maitland had been in 1901:\nFuller Maitland incorporated similar views in the second edition of \"Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", which he edited, while Walker's \"History\" was re-issued in 1923 and 1956 with his earlier verdict intact. As late as 1966, Frank Howes, former music critic of \"The Times\" wrote:\nThere were other writers who rose to praise Sullivan. For example, Thomas Dunhill wrote an entire chapter of his 1928 book, \"Sullivan's Comic Operas\", titled \"Mainly in Defence\", which reads in part:\nSir Henry Wood continued to perform Sullivan's serious music. In 1942 Wood presented a Sullivan centenary concert at the Royal Albert Hall, but it was not until the 1960s that Sullivan's music other than the Savoy operas began to be widely reassessed and revived.\n\nIn 1960 Hughes published the first full-length book about Sullivan's music and picked up the trail where Dunhill left off:\n\nIn recent decades, Sullivan's work outside of the Savoy Operas has begun to be re-assessed. The work of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, founded in 1977, and books about Sullivan by musicians such as Young (1971) and Jacobs (1986) contributed to the re-evaluation of Sullivan's serious music. Since the late 1960s most of Sullivan's major non-Savoy music has been professionally recorded. The \"Symphony in E\" had its first professional recording in 1968; his solo piano and chamber music in 1974; the cello concerto in 1986; \"Kenilworth\" in 1999; \"The Martyr of Antioch\" in 2000; \"The Golden Legend\" in 2001. In 1992 and 1993, Naxos released four discs featuring performances of Sullivan's ballet music and his incidental music to plays. Of his operas apart from Gilbert, \"Cox and Box\" (1961 and several later recordings), \"The Zoo\" (1978), \"The Rose of Persia\" (1999), and \"The Contrabandista\" (2004) have had professional recordings.\n\nIn recent decades, several publishers have issued scholarly critical editions of Sullivan's works, including Ernst Eulenburg (\"The Gondoliers\"), Broude Brothers (\"Trial by Jury\", \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" and \"Iolanthe\"), David Russell Hulme for Oxford University Press (\"Ruddigore\"), Robin Gordon-Powell at The Amber Ring (\"The Masque at Kenilworth\", the \"Marmion\" overture, the \"Imperial March\", \"The Contrabandista\", \"The Prodigal Son\", \"On Shore and Sea\", \"Macbeth\" incidental music, \"The Beauty Stone\" and \"Ivanhoe\"), and R. Clyde (\"Cox and Box\", \"Haddon Hall\", \"Overture \"In Memoriam\"\", \"Overture di Ballo\" and \"The Golden Legend\").\n\nIn 1957 a review in \"The Times\" explained Sullivan's contributions to \"the continued vitality of the Savoy operas\": \"Gilbert's lyrics ... take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan's music. ... [Sullivan, too, is] a delicate wit, whose airs have a precision, a neatness, a grace, and a flowing melody\". A 2000 article in \"The Musical Times\" by Nigel Burton noted the resurgence of Sullivan's reputation beyond the comic operas:\n"}

Dot first appeared in \"EastEnders\" in July 1985 as the mother of criminal Nick Cotton (John Altman). The character has worked as a launderette assistant for most of that time along with original character Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). Dot moved away with her son and his family in 1993. In reality, Brown left the show in 1993, unhappy with the axing of her co star Peter Dean, who played Pete Beale from the shows first episode to early 1993. Brown returned to the role in April 1997, and on 28 April 2017, Dot overtook Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) as the second longest-serving character in \"EastEnders\", surpassed only by original character Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). In a special episode entitled \"EastEnders: Dot's Story\" (2003) a young Dot was played by Tallulah Pitt-Brown in flashbacks. In April 2012, Brown took a six-month break from the show to write her memoirs. Dot temporarily departed on 18 May 2012. She returned on 14 January 2013. In February 2015, Dot began appearing less frequently due to Brown gradually losing her eyesight; this aspect of her life was later written into her character the following year. In January 2016, it was announced that Brown had renewed her contract with the BBC until March 2017. In January 2017 it was reported that the BBC were offering Brown £300,000 for a one-year contract. In April 2018 it was announced that Brown had renewed her contract again until 2019. Brown will be returning to the show in October 2018, after a break due to her health, alongside Harold Legg. Dot returned in the episode broadcast on 15 October 2018.\n\nA tragicomic character, Dot is known for her devout Christian faith, gossiping, chain smoking, hypochondria, and motherly attitude to those in need. A recurring storyline in the serial has been Dot's continuous forgiveness of her son's villainous crimes. Initially married at the start of the series to conman Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock), Dot married again in 2002 to pensioner Jim Branning (John Bardon) and the union proved to be popular with fans. Brown and Bardon won awards for their screen partnership. On 31 January 2008, Dot became the first character ever to appear in a monologue episode, \"Pretty Baby...\", of a British soap. The acclaimed episode saw Dot reminiscing about her years of loss and grief into a tape recorder as a message to her ailing husband Jim. Dot has been used to explore topical and controversial issues such as euthanasia, cancer, immigration and homophobia.\n\nDot has been generally well received by critics; she has been referred to as a cultural archetype and Brown has won multiple awards for her portrayal. However, aspects of the character such as her smoking and her religious beliefs have been criticised, with religious groups suggesting Dot's faith is used in a pejorative manner. The character has also made an impact on popular culture; she has been spoofed, most notably by Alistair McGowan, and has been credited as inspiration for catwalk collections.\n\nDot's backstory states that she was born in Walford, the main setting for \"EastEnders\", and was evacuated to Wales as a child during the Second World War. Her guardians, Gwen (Eve Myles; Gwenllian Davies) and Will (Dafydd Emyr), wished to adopt her, but Dot returned to Walford after Will's death and spent the remainder of her childhood helping her neglectful mother care for her younger half-siblings: Gerry, Tim and Rose (Polly Perkins).\n\nAged 18, Dot married Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock). The following year, he forced her to have an abortion; threatening to leave her if she did not, but left anyway. While Dot was giving birth to their son, Nick (John Altman), Charlie was having an affair with her sister, Rose, in Liverpool. She raised Nick alone, with Charlie making unannounced returns and departures sporadically, and although Dot doted on Nick, she was not an affectionate mother.\n\nDot is introduced to \"EastEnders\" soon after its launch as the gossiping, chain smoking, Christian friend of Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) and Lou Beale (Anna Wing) who works with Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) at the Walford launderette. She has a difficult life with a criminal husband, Charlie, and their son Nick, who appeared in the first episode. Charlie comes and goes, always treating Dot badly and stealing from her, until he dies in a lorry accident. Nick is also a criminal; he is involved in drugs, robberies and murder, and tries to cheat Dot out of her money. He attempts to poison her to inherit her bingo winnings, but is unsuccessful. Despite Nick's deeds, Dot believes he can be redeemed. Dot also associates herself as Walford's Good Samaritan, often taking in residents when they are homeless. Amongst these include Colin Russell (Michael Cashman) and Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), who becomes addicted to drugs. Dot believes that she can help Donna change for the better, but comes home one day to find Donna dead in her lounge. It is concluded that she died after choking on her own vomit, and Dot is devastated.\n\nHowever, Dot causes trouble for certain residents too, although not intentionally. She is responsible for the break-up of Saeed Jeffery's (Andrew Johnson) marriage to Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh). Due to the lack of lust in his marriage to Naima, Saeed begins visiting prostitutes. After continual pressure, Naima relents and finally consummates her marriage to Saeed, improving things between the couple (their marriage was arranged to begin with, much to their disliking), but their marital bliss is short-lived. Naima receives an anonymous letter from Dot, who has discovered Saeed's sordid exploits. Dot feels it is her Christian duty to inform Saeed's wife, and when Naima confronts Saeed, he does not deny it so she leaves him.\n\nIn 1993, Nick's girlfriend Zoe (Elizabeth Chadwick) arrives in Walford and introduces Dot to their nine-year-old son, Ashley (Rossi Higgins). Dot becomes close to Ashley and eventually Zoe asks her to move to Gravesend with them. Dot then leaves the Square.\n\nDot returns nearly four years later when Nigel tracks her down. She reveals that Nick has been arrested for drugs possession and Zoe and Ashley have moved away. After being held hostage by a convict friend of Nick, she returns to the square and is shocked when Nick returns unexpectedly. He tries to steal her money again by claiming he has AIDS and needs money to pay for illegally imported medication. Dot believes him but later discovers it is a lie and he is on the run from the police. She contacts the police, and he is arrested a week after his return.\n\nDot moves in with fellow senior citizen Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) and is arrested for the illegal use of cannabis, which she confuses for herbal tea. When Lilly leaves after she is mugged, Dot moves in with Pauline. Her oldest friend Ethel also comes to stay with the Fowlers for a time, having become terminally ill. Ethel begs Dot to help her end her life. Torn between her Christian beliefs against euthanasia and her best friend's wishes, she helps Ethel to die, but later feels she should be jailed for murder. When the police do not believe her story, Dot demands retribution in another form and she ends up in court for shoplifting. She initially avoids a prison sentence but is sent down for 14 days for contempt of court following an outburst in the courtroom.\n\nWhen Nick and Ashley (now Frankie Fitzgerald) reappear in Walford, Dot is pleased to have her family around and moves out of the Fowler household to live with them. However, Nick's feud with Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) causes Ashley's death after Nick cuts the brakes on Mark's motorbike and Ashley steals it and crashes. Dot disowns Nick after Ashley's funeral, having overheard the truth about Ashley's death during an earlier argument between Nick and Mark.\n\nShe starts a relationship with neighbour Jim Branning (John Bardon), but when he proposes, she is overwhelmed and leaves Walford. Jim perseveres and when they go on the London Eye one Christmas Eve, he proposes again and she accepts. They decide that they will have a platonic marital relationship. Dot is diagnosed with kidney cancer and decides not to tell anyone except her friend Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman). She initially refuses treatment and plans to die quietly, but is eventually persuaded to undergo chemotherapy and makes a full recovery.\n\nWhen Dot finds an abandoned baby, Tomas, in a church, she takes him home, leaving her contact details at the church and subsequently Tomas's mother Anya (Olga Fedori) arrives in Walford, revealing she is an illegal immigrant. Jim anonymously reports Anya and when she is deported, Dot hides Tomas from the authorities, vowing to take care of him. Dot and Jim struggle to look after the baby and, after talking to the local vicar and her old friend Dr Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton), Dot decides to hand him over to social services.\n\nJim suffers a stroke, leaving him seriously ill. Jim is placed in a nursing home, but Dot struggles with this decision and tries at a later date to care for Jim at home. However, she finds being a full-time carer exhausting and lonely. Eventually, after Dot experiences ill-health brought on by stress, Jim moves back to a nursing home.\n\nWhen Nick returns after a seven-year absence, he tells Dot he has changed and is now a plumber, introducing her to his six-year-old daughter Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin). However, Dot discovers that Nick is only there for her money. She refuses to pay him, so he tells her if she does not, she cannot see Dotty. Dot gives Nick the money and looks after Dotty. It is revealed Dotty and Nick are planning to kill Dot for her life insurance. They convince her that she has symptoms of dementia, but their plan backfires when Dotty exposes the plot. In a rage, Nick holds various members of the community hostage in the café, resulting in an explosion. Nick survives and after being disowned again by Dot, he informs her that Dotty had masterminded the murder plot before fleeing. Dotty is retrieved by her mother, Sandy (Caroline Pegg), following various devious deeds, such as accusing Dot of beating her, which leads to Dot being questioned by the police for child abuse. Nevertheless, Dot is sorry to see Dotty go.\n\nDot develops a friendship with vicar Edward Bishop (Frank Barrie), who develops romantic intentions towards her. Dot turns Edward down, remaining loyal to her husband. She takes in various lodgers, including Arthur \"Fatboy\" Chubb (Ricky Norwood), her sister Rose and Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), who causes Dot problems with the council for failing to pay the rent, leaving her in arrears. Dot is taken to court but manages to persuade the judge to allow her to keep her home and avoids a prison sentence. Fatboy later allows his girlfriend Poppy Meadow (Rachel Bright) to move in with him and Dot, and Dot forms a close bond with Poppy. When Fatboy and Poppy break up and Poppy moves out, Fatboy gently assures Dot that she and Poppy are still friends.\n\nDot receives a police visit, informing her that Nick has died. One of the police officers returns later to tell her that he is actually her grandson Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), a child of Nick's Dot had not known existed. A devastated Dot holds a funeral for Nick and grows close to Charlie in the aftermath as he moves in with Dot, causing Fatboy to move out. However, it is later revealed that Charlie is being dishonest and although he is Nick's son, he is not a policeman but a caretaker and that he has helped Nick stage his own death to avoid being arrested following a robbery. Nick reappears in Walford to Dot's shock and persuades his mother to hide him at her house. Although horrified that Charlie and Nick lied to her, she forgives Charlie and agrees to aid Nick's escape from the UK, this time for good. However, Nick later realises that he does not want to leave and gets embroiled in a feud with Charlie's fiancée, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), who tries and fails to ensure his departure. This leads to Nick tampering with the brakes of Charlie's car and the resulting crash leaves a pregnant Ronnie comatose in hospital. When Charlie discovers this, he demands that Nick leave, and as Charlie moves out to live at Ronnie's flat, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. However, Dot, unwilling to give up on her son, hides Nick in a derelict neighbouring house.\n\nUnable to leave the premises, Nick starts using heroin again but cannot feed his drug addiction and asks Dot to obtain drugs for him. Dot purchases the heroin but Fatboy catches her and urges her to cut ties with Nick. Dot urges Nick to confess to the police, but when he tells her he does not feel remorse for Ronnie's injuries, she gives him the drugs and storms out. Dot later finds Nick unconscious, having had a bad reaction to the drugs. When it is clear Nick is dying, Nick confesses various past misdemeanours, including the murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton). Nick seeks his mother's forgiveness and she cradles him as he dies, ultimately deciding not to call an ambulance to attempt to save his life. Dot, seeking punishment for this, decides to confess to the police and is arrested and imprisoned. Dot initially decides to plead guilty, believing she should atone for her sins in prison, but when Jim dies, she attends his funeral and realises how much her family needs her. She changes her plea and is cleared of murder at the court hearing; however, she is found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to prison for 14 months.\n\nFour months later, Dot is released and shares her regret with Ian that she did not report Nick's crimes earlier in life. Fatboy tells Dot he is spending Christmas with his father, but later Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) discovers Fatboy's belongings amongst some blood in the boot of a crushed car and tells Dot that Fatboy is not coming back because of a job abroad. Dot takes salsa classes and works with Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) to prepare for a salsa show, who mistakenly thinks she wants a relationship, but she actually sets him and Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) up on a date. Dot receives a wedding invitation from her old friend, Colin, but she does not want to attend because she does not believe in homosexual marriage. Colin visits her on his wedding day to persuade her to come, which she does. Dot discovers the launderette will become a dry cleaner and is interviewed for her own job; she struggles with the technical terminology but defends herself as a people person. However, she is told that she will not be kept on after the launderette is refurbished. She tries to contact her boss by telephone but when she finally gets through, he hangs up. Ricky Mitchell (Henri Charles) learns about the harvest festival and leaves a box of food on Dot's doorstep, which offends her as she does not believe she is poor or lonely, however, she realises just how lonely she is when Abi is unable to have dinner with her. Dot and Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) are involved in a car collision, but both blame the other as Kim has no licence but Kim accuses Dot of being too old to drive. Dot then locks her car key away. After Patrick and Dot go to the cinema together, he convinces her to see an optician because she was squinting throughout. Dot is seen hiding away in her house on Halloween and Patrick comes to talk to her. Dot says her hatred of Halloween is due to awful things happening on Halloween such as Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) getting electrocuted and Max Branning (Jake Wood) getting run over. She then tries to read the Bible to Patrick but cannot see the words. Patrick tells her she isn't scared of Halloween but of the world. Dot reveals that she thinks she is going blind but then kicks Patrick out of the house. When he leaves, it is revealed that Dot cannot see anything clearly. Patrick books Dot a doctor's appointment; the doctor suspects age-related macular degeneration, which is later confirmed. Dot starts treatment but she is annoyed that her eyesight does not improve much. She turns down Ronnie's offer of paying for surgery to permanently fix her sight.\n\nAbi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she has plans of her own. The launderette closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is too busy to visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children that they are in heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an appropriate way to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but he is only back for his son and she is upset when he leaves again with Matthew. Dot's step-granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing.\n\nDot trips over Dave and falls awkwardly onto a chair. Nobody knows she is injured until her step-granddaughter, Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), finds her. Dot is then taken to hospital and Sonia blames her neighbours for not looking out her and scolds Sharon and Ian. Dot is worried when the doctor tells her that she will need an operation on her hip but she refuses physiotherapy. Dot goes to stay with Dotty for three months, returning when she hears that Abi is brainstem dead after an accident. Dot is surprised to see the launderette had reopened and Karen Taylor (Lorraine Stanley) is working there. After attending Abi’s funeral, Dot goes to stay with Charlie, Liz and Matthew in Ireland.\n\nDot returns several months later. She is worried about her health and despite being told by her doctor that she is fine, she visits Dr Legg. He confirms that she is in good health and reveals he is dying of pancreatic cancer. Dot is shocked that he is refusing treatment but eventually accepts his decision and decides to make the most of the time they have left together.\n\nAlthough Dot had been referred to since the very early episodes of the programme as the mother of villain Nick Cotton (John Altman), she did not actually appear on-screen until episode 40 in July 1985. Dot was conceptualised by show creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, along with the other original characters. Introduced as the \"bible thumping, arch-gossip\" of the launderette, Dot was a character who bridged the generations. The actress June Brown was given the role after being recommended by actor Leslie Grantham, who played original character, Den Watts.\n\nBrown was offered the part of Dot Cotton for a period of three months initially and in her own words, she was brought in \"merely to be Nick Cotton's mother because Nick was coming back again\". Brown has told Decca Aitkenhead of \"The Guardian\" in 2009 that she was wary of joining a soap opera as she had seen \"EastEnders\" once on television, \"and there was an argument going on, and I thought, 'Oh, I don't want to watch all that,' so I switched it off. I didn't watch it again until I was asked to be in it.\" The role was extended and the character has become one of the longest-running to have featured in \"EastEnders\".\n\nIn order to become the character of Dot Cotton, Brown is required to wear a wig to replicate Dot's 1950s \"Italian Boy\" hairstyle that has remained in a largely unchanged style since she first appeared in 1985. Although Brown now wears a wig, for many years the hair sported by Dot actually belonged to the actress. Brown has stated that as soon as Dot's hairpiece is on, she becomes the character. The unchanged style of Dot was deemed so important by the programme makers, that when Brown requested to have dental work carried out to improve her prominent front teeth, the producers refused to allow it, arguing that Dot could not afford expensive tooth capping. Brown was not permitted to alter her teeth until early 1991 when they became loose. Brown has indicated that she does not want Dot's style altered. She claimed in 2002 that Dot had the same coats in her wardrobe that she was given in 1985. The fur-collared coat Dot wears for special occasions was donated by the character Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) in 1988 when she left the serial. Brown commented, \"I like the older clothes [...] I don't want new clothes, I'm happy the way she is. She thinks she looks really smart. She's got a terrible opinion of herself that woman!\"\n\nBrown has said that when she was cast as Dot, she was given a list of illnesses the character had. She added, \"It meant she was a because she had nobody to care about her. She was quite a selfish woman [initially].\" Dot has been described by author Hilary Kingsley as a \"born victim.\" She adds that \"with each blow that life delivers [Dot] bobs back up again, almost asking for more trouble, more pain, more suffering.\" Dot is renowned for being a hypochondriac, her Christian faith and quoting from the Bible. She has been described by Rupert Smith, author of \"20 Years in Albert Square\", as \"God-bothering\" and self-righteous. According to Kingsley, \"nothing shakes Dot's view that the world is good because the creator made it so. Her faith sustains her through the most appalling ordeals.\" The character once expressed part of the reason for her faith on-screen in 2000, commenting to a vicar, \"I couldn't manage without my faith, not with the life I've had\"; former executive producer of \"EastEnders\", John Yorke, has stated that this is his favourite line of EastEnders' entire existence. Author Antony Slide has noted that Dot's religious beliefs have given her solace, but has given her an excuse to be prejudiced against her neighbours, and to deal with the criminal antics of her wayward son. He described her as a \"simpleminded woman whom one loved to hate\".\n\nIn Kathryn and Phillip Dodd's published essay, \"From EastEnd to EastEnders\", Dot has been used as an example of the media's representation of the working-class as community-orientated, but defensive: \"evangelist-cum-launderette supervisor. Eagle-eyed, she patrols the Square, confronting evil and despair and asking those stricken with doubt to trust God, while simultaneously organizing the local Neighbourhood Watch scheme.\"\n\nThe character has taken on a matriarchal role in the absence of her own family, taking on the burdens of numerous waifs and strays throughout the show's history, including Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), Rod Norman (Christopher McHallem), Disa O'Brien (Jan Graveson), Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley) and Clare Bates (Gemma Bissix). Author Christine Geraghty asserts that Dot's role in the mothering structure of the serial has been confirmed.\n\nDescribing Dot, Brown has said, \"I love playing her – she's a strong character. Dear old Dot, she's got strong moral views and odd religious beliefs, but her heart's in the right place. She has that awful worried expression on her face the whole time\". Brown has noted the changes within Dot since the show's inception, saying that initially Dot was sharp and selfish, but since her character remarried in 2002, she has gained security and has \"no reason to have the hypochondria she had in the past [...] She's become more caring over the years. She enjoys the company of young people. She loves her church. She can get in an anxious state – I like it when Dot's hysterical! She's also amusing, mostly because she doesn't realise she is\".\n\nAs well as being tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has discussed the humour she incorporates into her performances: \"I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If you want to play comedy then you have to be very intense about it [...] very, very serious.\" Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as \"Ooh I say!\", uttered when she is \"stuck for words\". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: \"It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on.\" Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, \"She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit.\"\n\nSmoking cigarettes has become synonymous with Dot, and Brown has suggested that the habit is \"intrinsic\" to the character. Following the 2007 England smoking ban, it was reported in the \"Daily Mail\" that the BBC were refusing to prohibit the character from smoking on-screen despite the act being banned in workplaces, as they have \"to portray real life – and people smoke\". Dot's smoking was criticised by private healthcare company Bupa in 2008, when they rated her television's most unhealthy character. They suggest that, in order to spread a public message, Dot should appear breathless, not with \"implausibly good health\". They added, \"Though Dot Cotton has a smoker's voice – deeper than you might expect, she does not seem to be short of breath or wheezy\" and that viewers would be influenced by this. However, Dot's smoking has been described by broadcasting watchdogs Ofcom as \"justified in the context of the programme as a representation of an East End character\" and they therefore stipulate that enforcement of broadcast smoking-sanctions would be unlikely on \"EastEnders\".\n\nUpon her arrival, Dot Cotton was quickly established as the gossip, whose purpose, as author Anthony Slide sees it, was \"that of a Greek chorus, commenting on the foibles of her fellow residents of Albert Square, from her vantage point as manager of the local launderette\". The \"gossip\" is a soap opera role that author Christine Geraghty has described as \"crucial to the audience's engagement with a serial and provides both a source of information and a means of speculation for the viewer.\" She asserts that a fundamental aspect of British soap is the idea of supporting members of community, based on the sharing of intimate knowledge, allowing \"practical and emotional needs to be met\" within the enclosed community. However, according to Geraghty, there is nevertheless \"an unease about the price paid for such support and an acknowledgement of the fine-line between neighbourliness and nosiness. The 'gossip' personifies this unease and though her task of passing on information and ferreting out problems is crucial to the community, she [...] is frequently the butt of mockery and criticism [...] The avidity with which Dot Cotton seeks out news is the subject of some embarrassment to her more restrained neighbours but the exchange of information she provides is essential if the community is to provide support to its members [...] the very process of exchanging information makes her an essential yet mistrusted figure.\"\n\nIndeed, it has been noted that, throughout the soap's early years, Dot was portrayed as a \"lovable bigot\", prejudiced against her neighbours and only happy when others were not. During the 1980s, Dot was shown to exhibit both racism and homophobia to members of the Walford community. In 1987, Dot was shown to respond negatively to Colin Russell (Michael Cashman) upon learning he was gay, reacting in \"horror and ignorant self-righteousness\" and spreading rumours that Colin had AIDS. According to Gary Loach from GaydarNation, Dot was being used by the programme makers to expose the bigotry of the \"moral majority\" in the real world following a public and media backlash over \"EastEnders\"' screening of its first homosexual kiss. However, while Dot has portrayed bigotry, author Anthony Slide has noted that the character can typically be \"relied upon to drop her prejudices – she learned to accept both blacks and homosexuals in Albert Square.\"\n\nDespite Dot's remaining penchant for gossip, it has been noted by Cole Moreton of \"The Independent\" in 2008 that the character has \"evolved from a nasty gossip into a strong character for whom viewers feel warmth\". Author Dorothy Hobson has discussed this in her book \"Soap Opera\", suggesting that Dot, while providing a narrative function as a gossip, has in turn been the subject of other people's gossip, with her own problems, troubles and vulnerability.\n\nDot's relationship with her wayward son Nick (John Altman), has been a feature of the character's narrative since her inception. Unlike Dot, Nick is scripted as a semi-regular character, one who comes and goes sporadically and, as authors Jill Marshall and Angela Werndly have observed, \"we know heartache is in store for Dot Cotton every time her son, 'Nasty Nick', turns up [...] The recurrence of generic elements means we derive pleasure from expectation and prediction.\"\n\nExecutive producer Diederick Santer has discussed the \"wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship\" Nick shares with Dot and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: \"There’s that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone’s changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed.\" Actor Leslie Grantham has stated that Dot is the \"one friend in [Nick's] life\", while series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: \"Dot’s always going to forgive him. And that’s the beauty of Nick and Dot.\" Concurring with this sentiment, John Altman (Nick) agreed: \"No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know.\"\n\nOne of Nick's most notable returns to the series occurred in 1990. Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim that he was a born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her £1000 win on the bingo. \"EastEnders\" writer Sarah Phelps explained: \"For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick knew that. It was sort of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet.\" With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his new-found faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. Discussing the storyline, scriptwriter Colin Brake has indicated that at first it was not clear to the audience whether Nick had reformed or not, but as the weeks passed it became obvious that he did intend to kill his mother, as he was shown practising a fake suicide note in Dot's handwriting – a foil to cover the intended murder; according to Brake, Dot remained blithely and perhaps purposefully ignorant to his wrongdoing. The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast consisting of Nick, Dot, Nick's estranged father Charlie, Dot's close friend Ethel Skinner and Alistair the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the \"one time we saw a glimmer of Nick’s good side\", Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her.\n\nOther storylines have concentrated on Dot's various attempts to reform Nick, such as in 1991, when Nick returned with a heroin addiction. As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey. His resulting paranoia and cravings led him to escape and murder the first person he encountered, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). The episode where Eddie was murdered was the big autumn launch episode for 1991. Nick stood trial in January 1993; however, \"he got away with murder\" for a second time in the serial. Other scams have included Nick's attempt to con Dot by claiming he had AIDS in 1998 after escaping from prison, which ultimately led to Dot having him re-imprisoned. Then followed a plot that saw him largely responsible for the death of his son Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald) in June 2001, ultimately leading Dot to disown Nick and prompting to leave the Square again. He is not seen for more than seven years after this, although he was mentioned in 2006 when recovering from cancer off-screen.\n\nFollowing pleas from Brown to resurrect Nick, John Altman returned to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, Dotty (Molly Conlin), who was born in 2002 after Nick's previous exit. Altman explained: \"Nick needed something, because I think if he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast.\" As the storyline progressed, it was revealed that Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.\n\nIn March 2014, Dot is told by the police that Nick has died of respiratory failure from a heroin overdose the previous week. One of the police officers who breaks the news to Dot is Nick's son Charlie Cotton, although it is later revealed that he is impersonating a police officer. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from looking in the coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne to tell the truth and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive.\n\nNick reappears in Albert Square seven months after his faked death. Ronnie takes an instant dislike to him and tries to bribe him to leave but Nick returns for Charlie and Ronnie's wedding. Nick decides to get revenge on Ronnie and cuts the brakes of her car. After the wedding, Roxy, Charlie and Ronnie are involved in an accident which hits and later kills Emma Summerhayes, while Ronnie ends up in a coma but survives. Yvonne discovers that Nick cut the brakes of the car. Yvonne tells Charlie but he does not believe her until he catches Nick with some of the money Ronnie used to bribe him. Then Nick implicates Yvonne in Ronnie's accident, so Charlie asks them both to leave. Dot hides Nick next door and obtains heroin for Nick. Later she finds him unconscious, Nick regains consciousness briefly but later dies in Dot's arms, in the same location that Reg Cox was discovered 30 years earlier.\n\nLike Nick, Dot's first screen husband, Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock), was also a semi-regular character who came and went throughout his duration in the show. Depicted as bigamous and a conman, Charlie typically would reappear in the show whenever he needed money or temporary accommodation and, because of Dot's Christian ideals regarding forgiveness, Charlie would always be permitted to return. According to Christopher Hancock, Charlie was \"a truly revolting character, a loser.\"\n\nProducers decided to kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died off-screen when crashing his lorry on a motorway. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick had been involved in a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the \"EastEnders Handbook\" publication in 1991: \"We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [Nick] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only in a state of shock and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [her friend] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change.\" Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, \"I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to\".\n\nCharlie's funeral episode, written by Linda Dearsley, was aired on 11 July 1991, and was dominated by Dot's reaction to Charlie's death and her trip to identify his body. It is selected by writer Colin Brake as one of 1991's episodes of the year.\n\nDot's second significant romance was built upon by scriptwriters in 2000 on the behest of producer John Yorke. Dot was paired romantically with pensioner Jim Branning, played by John Bardon and a slow courtship was featured, with Dot often shown to be outraged by Jim's advances, resulting in numerous rejections. Dot finally succumbed and accepted his marriage proposal in an episode that aired in December 2001; the scenes were filmed inside one of the carriages of the London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames. Their wedding aired on 14 February 2002, Valentine's Day. \"The Guardian\" critic, Nancy Banks-Smith, described the wedding as \"uniquely uneventful [...] For Dot and Jim 'In sickness and health... till death do us part' seemed to carry more resonance than for most.\"\n\nBardon has revealed that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying. In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, \"Walford Gazette\", he commented, \"No way did the pair of us want to get married because we thought if we got married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right.\" Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might be a good thing. On-screen, Dot had just suffered the death of her grandson Ashley (in which Nick had played a part), and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death \"would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [but] with marrying Jim she gets a family – that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again – it will have a central point, they will be able to use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there.\"\n\nCritic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to \"Coronation Street\"'s Hilda and Stan Ogden, comparing a scene in \"EastEnders\" where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from \"Coronation Street\", that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: \"Initially, Jim wasn't the sort of person that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied – he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot – heaven knows why! I think that you always have to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around.\" Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying \"We work very well together – he's got great timing and he can be very tender too.\"\n\nThe on-screen relationship between Dot and Jim was halted in 2007 when Jim was hastily written out of the soap due to John Bardon suffering a major stroke. In the script Jim suffered a stroke and was placed in the care of off-screen relatives. Dot and Jim remained together, with Jim making sporadic appearances between 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot. A more permanent return for the character was announced in 2009. However, it was reported in April 2011 that Bardon had filmed his exit from the series, and that the show's staff believed it marked the end of the character. A source told the \"Daily Mirror\": \"Dot's been struggling for a while and realises that she can no longer give Jim the care and attention he deserves and is forced to make the heartbreaking decision that he should move into a home. [...] It was very emotional on the set for the scenes where Dot discusses her decision and talks to Jim about him going into care for good. There were a lot of tears. [...] The feeling is that this is the end of Jim as a character because he won't leave the home and won't ever be a regular in Albert Square again.\" It was reported that Jim could still appear in the care home if Bardon's health permitted it, although ultimately this did not happen, as Bardon never recovered enough to make any further appearances. Jim left the show on 26 May 2011. Brown opined that Dot would feel lonely without Jim, saying, \"I think she'll be very lonely and feel she doesn't have much purpose in life. It was really important to tell this story because there are so many people in a similar situation to Dot. It was moving to act out, too — not just because of Dot and Jim's relationship, but because I'm really good friends with John Bardon in real life.\" Jim died off-screen four years later, shortly after the death of actor John Bardon.\n\nIn May 2011, it was reported that Dot's estranged half-sister, Rose, would join the series, played by Polly Perkins. Reports stated that Dot and Rose fell out when the latter had an affair with the former's husband, Charlie, but Dot would decide to track Rose down after suffering a bout of hypochondria, feeling it is time to put things right, however, Rose will not be pleased to see Dot again after so many years.\n\nAn enduring friendship featured in \"EastEnders\" was the one shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). \"BBC News\" has described Dot and Ethel as an \"incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious\". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: \"Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. I caught a glimpse of her through the door. Sitting on top of the piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out \"Roll Out the Barrel\". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel.\" Critic for \"The Guardian\", Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: \"There was always one pretty and pert [Ethel], and always one in glasses [Dot].\" Banks-Smith adds that theirs was \"a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship.\"\n\nTheir bickering and personality differences were often used for comic effect; however, in episode 248 of the show, scriptwriter Colin Brake notes that viewers were shown a different side to Ethel and Dot's friendship in the soaps second two-hander episode. The episode aired in July 1987 and featured just the two old ladies (although Dot was Ethel's junior by twenty years or so). Brake has described the episode as a \"mini-play about nostalgia and growing old\", adding that \"some viewers found it too unusual, but many others were charmed by the change of pace\". According to Brake, the episode gave Franklin and Brown the opportunity to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Ethel and Dot. The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by Mike Gibbon, a future producer of the show. Author Christine Geraghty has used the episode as an example of the fact that \"female conversation is the backbone to traditional soap\".\n\nAuthor Dorothy Hobson has discussed the use of older female characters in British soap opera as a means of providing comedy. She compares Ethel and Dot's function in \"EastEnders\" to the trio of Ena Sharples, Minnie Caldwell and Martha Longhurst from \"Coronation Street\" with regard to providing humour. She has noted that following Ethel's retirement from the serial, the production team at \"EastEnders\" attempted to replicate Dot and Ethel's friendship by introducing a number of \"'friends' to fulfill the same function of a female friend for Dot and the series.\" An example of this was the character Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) who appeared between 1998 and 1999. The author goes on to note that Ethel's role in Dot's narrative was difficult to replace because \"far from being complete stereotypes, their relationships depend on them being long-standing friends with the ability to share stories and reminisce. For the characters to 'work', there is a need for unspoken intimacy and a shared knowledge for each other's lives. They carry the internal knowledge of the narratives and share that knowledge with the audience.\" Brown has spoken about the \"wonderful rapport\" she had with Gretchen Franklin who played Ethel. She added, \"I do miss Ethel, it was great with Dot and Ethel. They did try and stop us working together at one time, but the producer changed and it all went back to where it started.\"\n\nThroughout her time in \"EastEnders\", many of Dot's scenes have been set in Walford's launderette, where the character has worked as an assistant for almost the entire duration of her time in \"EastEnders\". Here, Dot was frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, Pauline Fowler, played by Wendy Richard from 1985–2006. Author Christine Geraghty has discussed the working environment the women inhabited, indicating that because the owner of the launderette is barely present, the \"working relationship hinges on the friendships (or otherwise) of the women who work in it\". As with Ethel, Dot and Pauline's friendship was often used for comedic purposes; emphasis was placed on their differences, leading to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 saw them \"buried alive\" underneath a collapsed fairground ride, in the midst of a cake-selling war. However, Pauline and Dot were most frequently shown gossiping, reminiscing about the past, or sharing their woes in the launderette. The duo has been described by television personality Paul O'Grady as a \"fabulous double-act\": \"Dot's probably Pauline's one and only confidant. Pauline eventually will break down and tell Dot things that she'd never tell anybody else.\" On the episode marking the screen death of Pauline on 25 December 2006, Dot remarks to Pauline, “You’re the only real friend I’ve got\", in a scene that Tim Teeman of \"The Times\" has described as \"one of the most moving scenes in a soap [in 2006]\".\n\nIn 1993, Brown decided to quit \"EastEnders\" after becoming \"discontented\" with the way Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the \"Daily Mirror\": \"I always felt Dot was one of those characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [but] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [Dot was hearing the gossip from others]. [Dot] was living on a reputation. [viewers] said to me, 'I loved it when [Dot] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up.\" Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she \"didn’t like what they were doing with Dot – she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character.\" The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.\n\nIn October 1996, newspapers reported that BBC bosses had approached Brown about reprising her role as Dot Cotton and, according to the \"Daily Mirror\", Brown had been in negotiations with \"EastEnders\" for several months prior. Brown is quoted by the paper as saying, \"I have always been reluctant to go back because I thought Dot's character was not being portrayed properly. I thought it had faded. I always said if Dot comes back it must be as Dot.\" Brown secured a deal to return and began filming on-location in Gravesend in February 1997. The episode saw Dot's former lodger, Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley), visiting Dot to discover that Nick was once again in prison, leaving Dot alone. Her return episode aired in April 1997. Brown has since revealed that she opted to return to \"EastEnders\" to raise her profile again. She had originally only intended to return for a 3-month stint, but was persuaded to stay when a project she had been working on was cancelled. In July 1997, she commented, \"I've decided to stay in EastEnders. They asked me, and in the end I thought: 'Oh well, I might as well.' Everyone, including Barbara Windsor, Wendy Richard and Adam Woodyatt, was saying: 'Don't leave'. And people were coming up in the street saying: 'It's lovely to have you back.' Anyway, I find playing the old dear quite fun.\" After a 5-month break, following Dot being held hostage in her flat by the escaped convict friend of her son, Brown returned to filming in October 1997 on a permanent contract.\n\nIn 2000, Dot was featured in a storyline about euthanasia, when her oldest friend Ethel, who had terminal cancer, asked her to help her die. The storyline allowed the production team to present all sides of the debate about euthanasia, from the perspective of the sufferer and from the person who is asked to assist in the mercy killing, religious and moral opposition. According to author Dorothy Hobson, \"Dot suffered torment as she struggled with her conscience and she tried to resist the request [...] to assist [Ethel] in the ultimate sin\". In the storyline, Ethel enjoyed the last days of her life and chose her final evening. Assisted by Dot, she took an overdose of her medication and died. Written by Simon Ashton and directed by Francesca Joseph the episode ended with a scene in which Ethel tells a weeping Dot \"you're the best friend I ever had\". Alternative credit music replaced the typical drum beats and theme tune at the end of the episode. The 1931 song used instead of the usual theme was \"Guilty\" by Al Bowlly. Ben Summerskill from \"The Observer\" has suggested that Dot's part in the euthanasia storyline was \"one of the most moving dramatic sequences shown in recent years on British TV\". The episode was voted the most emotional soap death in a \"Radio Times\" poll of 4,000 readers in 2006.\n\nThe repercussions of the euthanasia for Dot's character have been described as \"extremely serious\" as she suffered from \"untold guilt and felt that she needed to be punished for the action.\" The Executive Producer overseeing this storyline, John Yorke, has discussed the storyline in a speech given at the Bishops' Conference for clergy and other ministers in the Diocese of St Albans: \"Dot, as a good Christian, refused to help, until her love for her friend overcame her own fear of damnation. Riddled with an intolerable burden of guilt, she felt there was only one person she could talk to [Jesus] The Dot and Ethel storyline played out in over four months with many similar scenes, to an average audience of 16 million viewers. Dot [...] explored the full panoply of religious belief before coming back to terms with her maker. When Alan Bookbinder took over as head of religious broadcasting at the BBC he described \"EastEnders\" for the weeks the Dot and Ethel story ran as 'the best religious programme on television' and compared [it] to Graham Greene. While we felt a little uncomfortable in such exalted company, what it did show is that handled properly an audience is able to engage in, and relate to profound ethical debate.\"\n\nDeborah Annetts, CEO of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society (VES), has praised the storyline. In 2004 she commented, \"It was a sympathetic portrayal. It demonstrated to a lot of people their own experiences. Lots of us have had conversations with someone, particularly our mothers and fathers, where they have said to us: 'If I get really ill, you will end it, won't you?' The Dot/Ethel storyline showed just what that conversation can entail and what happens to the other person after – the guilt and pain they have to live with.\"\n\nSuch was the controversy surrounding this storyline that the University of Glamorgan uses the plot as part of their new approach to the study of British criminal law. Part of the law foundation course involves studying the soap opera and giving students the chance to decide if Dot Cotton's character is guilty of murder. The storyline is also featured in GCSE Religious Studies textbooks.\n\nIn a 2004 plot, Dot was diagnosed with kidney cancer. The programme makers sought advice from health care professionals when devising the storyline, including specialist information nurses from CancerBACUP. Nurse Martin Ledwick said, \"We drew on our experience of talking to the thousands of people who call our helpline, to help advise the \"EastEnders\" scriptwriters. Many people react to a cancer diagnosis as Dot does in the BBC serial – with confusion and fear. We also speak to family and friends affected by the illness and those living with continuing uncertainty. \"EastEnders\" explores all these issues, and hopefully will help improve people's understanding of what it's like to be affected by a cancer diagnosis.\"\n\nAccording to Macmillan Cancer Support, \"Dot's experience [increased] people's understanding of the emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis; how the illness affects family and friends; and what it's like to live with uncertainty. It also [helped] to raise awareness of a comparatively rare cancer and the fact that cancer is a disease most often affecting older people.\"\n\nBrown herself has confessed that she was unhappy with the storyline as she felt playing illness was not productive at her age. Discussing Dot's reluctance to reveal her illness to anyone, Brown said \"[it's] ironic because I've played her as a hypochondriac, longing for attention, for 20 years. Now something's wrong, she doesn't want anyone to know.\"\n\nIn the Easter 2007 episode, Dot takes an abandoned baby she finds in a church. This was filmed in Kent at Stansted, St. Giles Church in Wormshill, The Ringlestone Inn near Harrietsham and Court Lodge Farm. After being contacted by the child's Ukrainian mother Anya, Dot offers to care for both of them, however Jim turns Anya in to the authorities for being an illegal immigrant. Roz Laws of the \"Sunday Mercury\" questioned the plausibility of the storyline, observing: \"Babies aren't abandoned in the real world very often. But you can barely cross [Albert] Square [...] without tripping over poor tots who their mothers don't want.\" Laws also felt that the speed at which the immigration department operated was \"amazingly on-the-ball\", when in reality many illegal immigrants \"slip through the net\". The \"Daily Mail\" Jaci Stephen deemed the storyline one of the worst in \"EastEnders\" history, writing a critical review in which she opined that the use of the infant playing Tomas was tantamount to abuse, and criticised several scenes which saw the baby \"screeching until he was red in the face.\" Stephen questioned: \"How can the show justify this and, more to the point, how can his real-life mother stand by and do nothing to comfort the poor little mite?\"\n\nIn January 2008, Dot became the first soap opera character to be featured in a monologue episode, known as a \"single-hander\". Written by Tony Jordan, the episode features Dot recording a message for Jim, who is in hospital recovering from a stroke. The episode is entitled \"Pretty Baby...\", named after the song of the same name by Tony Jackson, which replaced the drumbeats and \"EastEnders\"' theme tune that typically accompanies the end credits of episodes. Brown was nominated in the Best Actress category at the 2009 British Academy Television Awards for her performance in the episode, becoming the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted for her role as Hilda Ogden in \"Coronation Street\".\n\nAccording to author Pauline Frommer, Dot has been embraced by the viewing British population as a cultural archetype. Brown has suggested that Dot has universal appeal because everybody knows a person like Dot. In 2009, a poll by magazine \"Inside Soap\" named Dot as the UK's 'greatest gossip' in a soap opera.\n\nBrown was nominated for the 'Best Actress' BAFTA award for Dot's single-hander \"EastEnders\" episode in 2009; she became the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted for her role as Hilda Ogden in \"Coronation Street\". The show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described Brown's BAFTA nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: \"I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's beyond me why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA – of which I'm a member – to connect with a big audience.\" Brown has also won 'Best Actress' for her role as Dot at the \"Inside Soap\" Awards in 2001 and 2004, as well as the 'Outstanding Achievement' award in 2003, and 'Best Couple' in 2005 with John Bardon, as Dot and Jim Branning. She and Bardon also won 'Best On-Screen Partnership' at the British Soap Awards in both 2002 and 2005, while in 2005, Brown won a 'Lifetime Achievement' award for her role, again at the British Soap Awards. The role also resulted in several award nominations including a 'Most Popular Actress' nomination at the National Television Awards in 2005, and a 'Best Actress' nomination at the 2007 \"TV Quick\" and \"TV Choice\" Awards among others. Dot was also voted the 46th best television character in a television poll entitled \"The 100 Greatest Television Characters\".\n\nAt the time of the 2005 general election, Labour chiefs feared that an episode of \"EastEnders\" in which Dot learned to drive could distract viewers from voting. In the same year, Dot was criticised as revealing an anti-religious bias on the part of the BBC. Dr Indarjit Singh, editor of the \"Sikh Messenger\" and patron of the World Congress of Faiths suggested that Dot's endless quoting from the Bible served to ridicule religion. The character has been cited as an example of anti-Christian bias in the media. The BBC were accused of portraying Christians as old-fashioned in 2008 after an episode aired in which Dot asked a gay, male couple to stop kissing. The BBC responded, \"\"EastEnders\" aims to reflect real life, and this means including and telling stories about characters from many different backgrounds, faiths, religions and sexualities.\" In a report to the BBC’s Board of Governors in July 2004 regarding religion, Dot was used as an example of how religion can be portrayed as stereotypical \"out-of-date and occasionally offensive\" in drama and entertainment output, that Christian figures are highlighted because of their faith \"rather than seen as normal people who also have a religious belief\". It was suggested that some Christians think Dot \"is made deliberately unappealing to audiences by her eccentric traits and hypocritical behaviour\". However, it was also suggested that others think she is convincing.\n\nBrown's single-hander episode of \"EastEnders\" received much critical acclaim. \"The Guardian\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> Nancy Banks-Smith deemed Brown possibly the only member of the cast with the exception of Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell) capable of carrying such a monologue. Robert Hanks for \"The Independent\" wrote that \"I don't ever remember hearing anybody on a soap talk like this before. I mean, like a real person, with real feelings, such as self-pity and a desperate urge for self-preservation. Brown conveyed the seedy gloom of it all beautifully, as well.\" Conversely, Tim Teeman posed the question in \"The Times\": \"I know she’s a national institution and June Brown plays her like a dream, but was last night’s Dot Cotton extravaganza really that great? Or even necessary?\" Teeman opined that: \"Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic. But this was much-loved character overkill.\" He deemed Dot a \"soap icon\", however he also assessed that:\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Gerard O'Donovan agreed that \"June Brown, as Dot, was mesmerising\", but was similarly critical of the episode as a whole, concluding: \"Overall [...] the feeling couldn’t be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was a fuss over nothing. Had it been a swan song, it would have been a worthy one. But doubtless Dot will be out and about again tonight, fag in hand, quoting from the Good Book. Enjoyable as this Albert Square indulgence was, I suspect that most fans will be hoping this one-hander remains a one-off.\" Leigh Holmwood for \"The Guardian\" suggested that viewers may have agreed with O'Donovan's assessment, highlighting the fact that the episode received only 8.7 million viewers, compared to 9.4 million watching \"EastEnders\" the previous week. A 2003 episode centred around Dot also resulted in a notable ratings slump. The New Year episode, which detailed her childhood evacuation to the countryside, received just 8.1 million viewers, compared with 12.2m the previous evening and 16m on Christmas Day. Prior to this, however, a 2002 two-hander episode featuring just Dot and Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) was watched by 11.5 million viewers, with an almost 60% share of viewers in the timeslot.\n\nThe character of Dot Branning has been spoofed in the cartoon sketch show \"2DTV\". She was also impersonated by Alistair McGowan in his television series \"Big Impression\". As part of the sketch, Dot and her son Nick were morphed into a version of the sitcom duo \"Steptoe and Son\". McGowan stated in 2001 that Dot was his favourite impression, because he \"looks a bit like her\".\n\nDot's old-fashioned style of dress has been likened to the clothing collection of Prada's designer, Miuccia Prada. Dot has been said to have inspired clothing, hairstyles and has been quoted by various fashion professionals as a style icon. She has also inspired catwalk themes, such as that of aspiring designer Hollie Luxton in 2007, who stated, \"I wanted to capture the nostalgia of the bygone days and play with the idea of clothing coming out of the wash misshapen and faded.\"\n\nDot's long-suffering luckless life has also led to her being labelled as a gay icon by Tim Lusher of the \"Evening Standard\". The monthly Dot Cotton Club, a gay club night in Cambridge, is named in her honour.\n\nDot is a notable smoker on British television as she regularly appears on-screen smoking. The character is so synonymous with smoking that the term \"Dot Cotton syndrome\" is used within the health industry to: \"describe the elderly population who continue to smoke heavily without registering the health problems they are or will soon suffer from, seeing it as their only pleasure left in life\".\n\nImpressionist Francine Lewis performed an impression of Dot Cotton in the seventh series of \"Britain's Got Talent\". During 2003, a promotional advertisement for the BBC featuring a character, Fizz, from the children's television programme \"The Tweenies\" pulling off a mask and morphing into Dot received complaints. Parents complained that their children were having nightmares and the BBC subsequently moved back the screening times.\n\nIn the BBC drama \"Line of Duty\" one of the prominent detectives in series 1–3, Matthew Cottan, is nicknamed 'Dot'.\n\n"}

His father early initiated him to the art of watch making and Eberhard was only 22 when he founded the company.\n\nIn 1907, the company has become one of the largest Swiss watch manufacture and inaugurated its new headquarters which takes an entire block at the very center of rue Leopold Robert, La Chaux-de-Fonds's main avenue. The Parisian-like five-story building was designed in distinctive \"Beaux Arts\" style with a round tower topped by a large eagle sculpture,and has become one of the city's well-known landmarks and its highest structure until the 1960s.\nIn 1919, Eberhard's sons, Georges and Maurice took over the company.\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the manufacture resumed its activities and, in 1947, made its first woman's watch, starting its jewelery collections.\n\nSince 1996, the manufacture has decided to focus on luxury king-size wristwatches and launched a new \"Grande Taille\" (\"Super Size\") collection. \nTrue to its history of technical challenges, Eberhard & Co launched in 1997 the \"8 days\" \"a manually winding mechanical watch that needs to be rewound every eight days only\" thanks to a special winding device and, in 2001, it launched the Chrono 4 \"the first chronograph in the history of watchmaking whose counters are arranged in one row\".\nIn 2017 Eberhard & Co. celebrated its 130th anniversary of uninterrupted watch production.

The mountain, where the fortress is located is surrounded by Maiden Tower and Cangi mountain from the south, Tana mountain and the Alchalı Pir forest from the east, Mount Ulguc from the north and Galadarasi from the west.\n\nIt is unknown when the fortress was built. It is believed that the history of the fortress dates back to XIII century. It is often referred to in the sources of the XV century.\nThe fortress was a shelter for Shirvanshah during Mongol conquest. It was also used during the period of Shirvanshah Kequbad and Kavus. When Shah Ismayil attacked Shirvan in 1509, Shirvanshah Shaykhshah was defended at Bughurt fortress. In 1518 the Safavid armies attacked Shirvan under the leadership of Alqas Mirza Safavid. Shahrukh and lawyer Hussein Bey, who retreated into the Bughurt fortress, could resist the Safavids for several months. Also, at that time, the treasury of the Shirvanshahs was kept at the Bughurt fortress.\n\nAccording to Iskandar Munshi’s writings, during these wars both Gulustan and Bugurt fortresses was destroyed by the order of Tahmasp.

{"id": "37275120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37275120", "title": "Gayby", "text": "Gayby\n\nGayby is a 2012 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Jonathan Lisecki and starring Jenn Harris, Matthew Wilkas, Mike Doyle, Anna Margaret Hollyman, Jack Ferver, and Jonathan Lisecki. It is based on the 2010 short film of the same name. It debuted on March 12, 2012 at the South by Southwest film festival.\n\nJenn (played by Jenn Harris), a yoga instructor, and Matt (played by Matthew Wilkas), a comic book store worker, are best friends from college who are now single and in their 30s. In agreement with a pact they made in their youth, the two decide to have a baby (\"gayby\") together, even though Jenn is straight and Matt is gay. Jenn's grandmother set her up with a trust fund if she ever had a child, so Jenn is confident that she and Matt will have the finances to have one. However, Jenn states that she wants to have a baby through natural conception, so the two begin awkwardly having sex. \n\nMeanwhile, Jenn is concerned with the stunted life she is living, treated as an underling at her yoga studio. Matt is recovering from a devastating break up with his partner of six years, Tom, who is a rising comic book publisher. Matt finds difficulty in getting back into the dating game and finds himself constantly avoiding awkward run-ins with Tom.\n\nThe two friends resolve to reinvigorate their dating lives and achieve their longterm goals—Jenn pushes the idea of innovative \"warm\" yoga classes at her studio, while Matt works on his own comic book, \"Gayby\"—about the adventures of a heroic gay baby—to pitch to a distributor. Both receive advice from friends about their goals and the pregnancy attempts—Jenn from her gay co-worker Jamie and her aggressive sister, Kelly, who is in the process of adopting a child, and Matt from his dry-witted friend Nelson, who helps them with their fertility treatments, having been a surrogate father himself.\n\nAfter dating around, Jenn has a one-off night of passionate sex with her boss's brother, Louis. Meanwhile, Matt meets a divorced, newly out, gay father, Scott, who buys comic books at his store. The two begin a relationship, but Matt is frustrated at how slowly Scott wishes to proceed. Jenn and Matt are later thrilled when they learn Jenn is finally pregnant.\n\nWhile talking with Louis, Jenn is furious to learn that Louis has a girlfriend and that he cheated on her with Jenn. In trying to defend himself, Louis reveals that their condoms broke during sex, but that he thought Jenn knew and was okay with it. Jenn is devastated by the possibility that the child may not be Matt's after all. Her boss, upon learning that her brother cheated on his girlfriend again with Jenn, angrily asks her to take a leave of absence from the yoga studio.\n\nWhile attending Matt's birthday party, Jenn hesitantly reveals that the child might be Louis's, which devastates Matt. He asks Jenn to return his apartment key and refuses to speak to her. Falling into a depression, Jenn is visited by Kelly, who tells her that her adoption process failed. She instead offers to raise Jenn's baby, arguing that Jenn is not fit—either in lifestyle or career—to raise a child on her own, and will block the trust fund if necessary. Jenn is taken aback and exclaims that she will be able to raise the child and give it a great life, even if Matt never forgives her and she is forced to raise it alone. Satisfied that Jenn has what it takes, Kelly reveals that the adoption went through and that her offer was a ruse to bolster her sister's conviction.\n\nJenn returns to work and offers to buy into the yoga studio with some of her trust fund money, securing her future with the studio and furthering her career. Enticed by the opportunity to split the responsibility of studio ownership with someone and seeing that Jenn's \"warm\" yoga has become an immense hit, her boss accepts, and they both agree to restart their friendship. \n\nNelson reads over Matt's comic and convinces him that it is worth submitting to a publisher. Matt finds closure with Tom by finally speaking with him and asking him if he would pass his proposal up to one of his superiors. Tom happily agrees, stating that he is pleased to see Matt is doing better. Though he is excited about this development, Matt is still depressed that the child may not be his. Nelson tells him that even if the child isn't his biologically, it is still his child because he and Jenn wanted to have it together. That it has a loving family is what's most important.\n\nJenn arrives at the comic book store to ask for Matt's forgiveness, and offers to raise the child with him one last time. Though silent at first, Matt relents and the two make up, preparing for the baby's arrival.\n\nOne year later, Matt's comic book is a success and he has furthered his relationship with Scott, who enthusiastically helps care for the baby. Jenn has begun a relationship with one of Matt's co-workers and stops by Matt and Scott's place to give them the night off of baby-duty. It is then that Scott tells Jenn of his plan to secretly propose to Matt that evening. After Matt and Scott leave, Jenn cuddles with the baby and says, \"You sure do look like your father,\" leaving the true identity of the baby's father unknown.\n\n\nMerlinka festival International Queer Film Festival, Belgrade Serbia - Best Queer Film\n\n"}

Co-stars include Jeanne Tripplehorn as Jacqueline Kennedy (Little Edie's cousin) and Ken Howard as Phelan Beale (Little Edie's father). The film, directed by Michael Sucsy and co-written by Sucsy and Patricia Rozema, flashes back and forth between various events and dates ranging from Little Edie as a young débutante in 1936 moving with her mother to their Grey Gardens estate through the filming and premiere of the actual 1975 documentary \"Grey Gardens\".\n\nFilming for the HBO film began on October 22, 2007 in Toronto. It first aired on HBO on April 18, 2009.\n\nThe film won the 2009 Television Critics Association award for Outstanding Achievement Movies, Miniseries, and Specials. It was also nominated for 17 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning Outstanding Made for Television Movie, Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie (Lange) and Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie (Howard). It was also nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Made for Television Movie and Best Actress in a Made for Television Movie (Barrymore). Lange was also nominated in this category.\n\nThe film is based on the life stories of the eccentric paternal aunt and first cousin of Jackie Kennedy, both named Edith Bouvier Beale. The elder Edith Bouvier Beale was the sister of Jackie Kennedy's father John Vernou Bouvier III and was referred to as \"Big Edie\", her daughter was referred to as \"Little Edie\". The Beale women were members of NYC high society, but in their later years, withdrew from the New York City life, taking shelter at their Long Island summer home/estate Grey Gardens. The house eventually fell into a state of disrepair that gave the Beale women notoriety.\n\nPhelan Beale (husband of \"Big Edie\" and father of \"Little Edie\"), eventually divorced \"Big Edie.\" In the movie, \"Little Edie\" decides to move to New York to pursue a career in acting (as well as an ill-fated romance with high-profile married man, Julius 'Cap' Krug). Her father frankly tells her that she has to find a husband to support her lifestyle. \"Little Edie\" sadly and slowly realizes her fate is to remain her mother's companion at Grey Gardens. The two women become reclusive and known around town as the highly eccentric proprietors of Grey Gardens, which has become decrepit and full of stray animals taken in by the Beale women. The plot includes the filming of the documentary \"Grey Gardens\" by Albert and David Maysles as well as flashback events in the Beales' past, including their arrival at the estate, the disintegration of Big Edie's marriage, and Little Edie's failed attempts to have her own life and find independence.\n\nAfter Phelan Beale dies, the two sons tell their mother, Big Edie, that there is little money and she should sell the estate and move to Florida. The house was in her name and this was her home. She was going nowhere. Grey Gardens became a health hazard, over run with cats and also infested with raccoons. Health officials condemned the home and newspaper articles ran blaming Jackie Kennedy. Jackie goes to the home in a chauffeur driven limousine for a visit. Jackie and her sister, Lee, pay for the cleanup and restoration of the Hampton's home. Mom and daughter grow old together. The documentary is finished and Little Edie attends the premiere, wearing a surprise gift from her mother.\n\nThe movie ends with Little Edie singing \"Tea for Two\" at the Reno Sweeney cabaret in Greenwich Village, and the quote, \"My mother gave me a truly priceless life.\"\n\nMichael Sucsy said that he used primary sources to flesh out the story including letters and journals kept by Little Edie. He also interviewed family members and friends including Lois Wright who lived in the house and wrote her own book about the events. Albert Maysles is credited as a source in the movie. Sucsy said that the house facade as well as the interior were created from blueprints. Sucsy said that an aerial shot of the house circa 1936 was historically accurate on the placement of the house in relation to other mansions in East Hampton at the time (although requiring CGI enhancements to create the illusion). As with many movies based on historical events, some events in the Beales' lives, such as the timing of Big Edie and Phelan's divorce, were shifted to make a more coherent story.\n\nThe entire film was shot in Ontario, with most of the shots in metropolitan Toronto. The Valley Halla Estate in Rouge Park was the setting of exterior shots of Grey Gardens. Waterfront shots were on Centre Island in the Toronto Islands. Hotel shots were at the Fairmont Royal York. Studio work was done at Toronto Film Studios.\n\nThe aerial shot of The Pierre was licensed from \"An Affair to Remember\".\n\nPost-production was done in New York and Los Angeles. The DVD commentary was done in the same studio where the Maysles mixed the original documentary.\n\nThe movie has been lauded by many critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% out of 10 professional critics gave the film a positive review. Ben Lyons from \"At the Movies\" raved: \"Drew Barrymore is fantastic in this film.\" \"Rolling Stone\" critic Peter Travers also raved: \"The script hits a few bumps, but Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore are magnificent as the bizarro Beales. Barrymore is a revelation. Aging into her 60s and transformed in voice and bearing, she finds Edie's unquenchable spirit. Brava.\"\n\nThe film received a Golden Globe for Best Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television, while Drew Barrymore received a Golden Globe for her role as Little Edie. Jessica Lange was also nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as Big Edie.\n\nDrew Barrymore received a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries for her role as Little Edie. Jessica Lange was also nominated in the same category.\n\nThe film won the 2009 Television Critics Association award for Outstanding Achievement Movies, Miniseries, and Specials.\n\nThe film's 17 Primetime Emmy Award nominations in 2009 for the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, including three for Sucsy, tied the all-time nomination record for Outstanding Made for Television Movies:\n\nAs well as:\n\nThe Academy Award-winning composer Rachel Portman provided the film score. In addition to Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, the album includes vocal performances by the movie's lead actresses, Jessica Lange (on \"We Belong Together\" and \"I Won't Dance\" sung with Malcolm Gets) and Drew Barrymore (on \"Tea for Two\").\n\n\n"}

The square was inaugurated when Gothenburg held a major international industrial exhibition, 1923, celebrating the city's 300th anniversary.\n\nGötaplatsen is Gothenburg's cultural hub, enclosed by the Gothenburg Concert Hall (where the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra resides), the Gothenburg Museum of Art, the Gothenburg City Theatre and the City Library. At the centre of the square presides the Poseidon statue by Carl Milles—the statue has become one of the symbols of the city. On the city's annual culture festival different Swedish musical artists usually perform free at the square, bands like Hardcore Superstar, Mustasch and Teddybears have all performed at this occasion.\n\nGötaplatsen got its name in 1914, but until 1923 the area was strictly rural. Götaplatsen was designed by the architects Sigfrid Ericson and Arvid Bjerke and construction began in 1921. The Gothenburg Museum of Art was completed just in time before Gothenburg’s 300th anniversary in 1923, the Gothenburg Exhibition.\n\nMuch of the southern part of Götaplatsen is terraced in stone with wide stairs leading up to the Gothenburg Museum of Art's seven high arches. Until the 1980s, the museum of art´s entrance was positioned at the top of the archway. Today however, the entrance has been moved a number of levels further down, closer to the street level, where the Hasselblad Centre is also located. \n\nAcross the gallery, which is located as a side-house to the Gothenburg Museum of Art at Götaplatsen’s southeastern corner, stood a triumphal arch which was the entrance to the exhibition area during the Gothenburg Exhibition. This triumphal arch was demolished in 1928.\n\nIn 24 September 1931 the statue Poseidon was inaugurated. The Gothenburg City Theatre was opened on 29 September 1934. The following year, in 1935, the Gothenburg Concert Hall was built on the other side of Götaplatsen. \n\nIn 1967 the Gothenburg Public Library was opened. This is next door to Lorensbergsteatern, below the Gothenburg City Theatre across Berzeliigatan.\n"}

It was released on August 3, 2017, as a promotional single from her then titled debut studio album \"The Hurting. The Healing. The Loving.\", later retitled to \"Camila\" (2018), along with \"OMG\". On August 30, 2017, via social media, Cabello confirmed the song as the album's second single. It was serviced to radio on September 8, 2017. Due to the rising success of the song, \"Havana\" later became the proper lead single of Cabello's debut album, replacing \"Crying in the Club\". On November 11, 2017, a remix version of the song with Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee was uploaded to Cabello's YouTube page. The first verse of the remix is sung in Spanish while Daddy Yankee replaces Young Thug's verse. \n\nThe song reached number one in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Poland, Scotland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It also reached the top 10 in a number of countries, including Austria, Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nIts music video was directed by Dave Meyers and premiered on October 24, 2017. The video shows Cabello playing herself as Karla, as well as a telenovela actress and a movie protagonist, and features cameos by Lele Pons, LeJuan James, Noah Centineo, Marco Delvecchio and Mikey Pesante. It won the Video of the Year trophy at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, receiving other three nominations. A vertical video was also released, showing the singer and several dancers in a New York City subway, as well as a pianist's hands. Cabello has performed \"Havana\" in several live appearances, including at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards, 2018 iHeartRadio Music Awards, and 2018 \"Billboard\" Music Awards. On September 21, 2018, Cabello released a live version of the song featuring her solo performance.\n\n\"Havana\" is a salsa-inspired mid-tempo pop track, and lyrically finds the singer embracing her Cuban heritage. Cabello sings the chorus over Latin-influenced piano riffs and rhythm, with the melody's chord progression constantly switching between Gm—E—D and Gm—Emaj—D. Sadie Bell of \"Billboard\" interpreted the line \"Half of my heart is in Havana\" as the song chronicling \"a romance that found Cabello's heart left down south,\" while for \"Rolling Stone\"s Brittany Spanos, in the \"clubby, smooth\" track, Cabello falls in love with \"a mysterious suitor from East Atlanta\", though she has left her heart in her hometown. Young Thug performs a sing-song verse over the \"bouncy\" piano. Some music publications described the song as \"Latin fusion\" and pop. A no-rap version replaces the second verse featuring Young Thug with Cabello's own lyrics as well as a spanglish version and a live version of the song.\n\nWriting for \"Billboard\", Sadie Bell expressed that the \"sexy\" track radiates a \"Latin flare\". Similarly, Much's Allison Browsher opined the track \"arrives just in time to keep the summer heat going on the radio.\" Raise Bruner of Time.com wrote that \"Havana\" \"hits a freshly sultry note that we hope to see more of in her debut album.\" Peter A. Berry of \"XXL\" opined Young Thug's verse \"blends with the bouncy piano perfectly.\" \"Billboard\" considered it the 19th best song released in 2017, while \"The Fader\" ranked it 48th. \"Billboard\"s critics' list placed it first on \"Every Fifth Harmony Solo Single, Ranked\" in March 2018. Jamieson Cox of \"Pitchfork\" portrayed, \"Camila Cabello’s sultry, salsa-inflected 'Havana' is a keystone for a superstar origin story\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Havana\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number 53 on the chart dated August 11, 2017. It rose to number two in its ninth week, behind only Post Malone's \"Rockstar\" featuring 21 Savage. On November 3, it reached number one, giving Cabello and Young Thug their first UK number-one single. It then held the top position for five weeks before falling behind Ed Sheeran's \"Perfect\".\n\nIn October 2017, the single reached number seven on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in its twelfth week, becoming Cabello's second top 10 entry as a solo artist and Young Thug's first. In January 2018, \"Havana\" reached number-one on the Hot 100 for one week after spending seven non-consecutive weeks occupying the number two spot behind both Post Malone and 21 Savage's \"Rockstar\" for five weeks and Ed Sheeran and Beyoncé's \"Perfect\" for an additional two weeks, becoming both Cabello and Young Thug’s first song to top the chart. The song took 23 weeks to reach the top spot, equaling the longest climb for a female artist with Sia's \"Cheap Thrills\" (2016) and Patti Austin's \"Baby, Come to Me\" (1982–1983). Cabello became the third artist in chart history to top both the Hot 100 and \"Billboard\" 200 for their first time in the same week, after Britney Spears and Beyoncé did so in 1999 and 2003, respectively. The track then fell to number three one week later when \"God's Plan\" by Drake debuted at the summit. The song has also been certified 5× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). \"Havana\" became the ninth song to top the Mainstream Top 40, Rhythmic and Adult Top 40 airplay charts–over the 22 years that all three charts have coexisted.\n\n\"Havana\" reached number one on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart in its twelfth week on the chart, becoming Cabello's first number-one song, including during her time as part of Fifth Harmony. It held the summit for three weeks before also being displaced by \"Perfect\".\n\nThe song became Spotify's most-streamed song ever by a solo female artist in June 2018, with over 888 million streams at the time.\n\nCabello shared a 26-second preview of the short film for \"Havana\" on October 22, 2017, through her YouTube channel. The video featured appearances by Lele Pons as Bella, LeJuan James as Grandma Abuelita, Noah Centineo as Cabello's love interest, Marco DelVecchio as the twins Juan and Rodrigo and Mikey Pesante as the dancer. It was directed by Dave Meyers and was released on October 24, 2017.\n\nThe music video starts with Karla, played by Cabello, watching a telenovela, before being interrupted by her grandmother, who turns off the TV and advises her to live her life instead of spending her days indoors. Karla then leaves the house to go see a movie. The film she is watching, called \"Camila in Havana\", takes the form of a music video, starring a version of herself wearing a fringe-covered red dress and performing at a club. Aside from appearing as Karla, Cabello also plays the telenovela actress and the movie protagonist. After the film ends, she leaves the cinema and stumbles across a cyclist, also the male protagonist of the film, and begins dancing with him. As of November 2018, the video has received more than 700 million views on YouTube, while there is an audio-only version with over 1.4 billion views on YouTube, making it the 64th most viewed video on the site.\n\nIt received four nominations at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, for Video of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Video, and Best Choreography, winning the first.\n\nA vertical video, directed by Sam Lecca, was released on November 10, 2017, on her official Vevo account. The clip shows Cabello and dancers on a New York City subway. The video was previously a Spotify exclusive.\n\nCabello performed the song for the first time on television on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" on September 25, 2017. The same week she performed on \"The Today Show\", where she delivered a message to \"all the dreamers\" in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. On October 27, Cabello performed a Spanglish version of the song at the Latin American Music Awards. She also performed the song at the BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards, LOS40 Music Awards iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina, and the MTV Europe Music Awards. Her performance at the MTV EMAs was ranked as the best of the night by \"Billboard\" writer Joe Lynch. It was also performed at \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" in 2017, and later she gave a cabaret-style performance on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" during the album release week.

{"id": "12385458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12385458", "title": "Hidden faces", "text": "Hidden faces\n\nPeople often see hidden faces in things. Depending on the circumstances, this is referred to as pareidolia, the perception or recognition of a specific pattern or form in something essentially different. It is thus also a kind of optical illusion. When an artist notices that two different things have a similar appearance, and draws or paints a picture making this similarity evident he makes images with double meanings. Many of these images are hidden faces or hidden skulls.\n\nThese illusionistic pictures present the viewer with a mental choice of two interpretations: head or landscape, head or objects, head or architecture, etc. Both of them are valid, but the viewer sees only one of them and very often he cannot see both interpretations simultaneously.\n\nThere are everyday examples of hidden faces, they are \"chance images\" including faces in the clouds, figures of the Rorschach Test and the Man in the Moon. Leonardo da Vinci wrote about them in his notebook: \"If you look at walls that are stained or made of different kinds of stones you can think you see in them certain picturesque views of mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, broad valleys, and hills of different shapes. You can also find in them battles and rapidly moving figures, strange faces and costumes, as well as an infinite number of things.\" Francois and Jean Robert collected and published a lot of photos of \"chance faces\".\n\nThe Mannerist master at the 16th-century imperial Habsburg courts of Vienna and Prague, Giuseppe Arcimboldo of Milan was probably the best known artist for creating extraordinary hidden faces. He arranged flowers, vegetables, fruits, shells, scallops and other animals, books and different things on the canvas in such a way that the whole collection of objects formed a portrait. His series of The Four Seasons seems to be the first use of this approach and technique. Arcimboldo's composite heads were celebrated and imitated by his contemporaries but they were relatively forgotten until participants in the twentieth-century art movements rediscovered them, bringing them to the attention of art historians. He is considered as forerunner of Dada and Surrealism.\n\nSome other famous Renaissance and Baroque artists created hidden faces:\n\nSalvador Dalí was fascinated by the technique of Arcimboldo and his paranoia-critical method was influenced by the Mannerist painter. For Dalí the Arcimboldo effect was form of self concealment as well as this exhibitionist painter seemed, all throughout his life of constant posturing, to hide his real self behind the gaudy externals of his behaviour. Larvatus prodeo, \"I wear a mask,\" he could have said with Descartes and he used this quotation from the French philosopher for the epigraph of his novel \"Hidden Faces\". Probably his most famous \"hidden face\" is Voltaire in his oil painting: \"Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire\".\nOther Surrealist painters rediscovered the technique of hidden faces in the first part of 20th century: \n\nIstvan Orosz tries to combine the technique of anamorphosis with the hidden faces. \nAnamorphosis is used for those works of art that were made as distorted and unrecognizable through clever geometrical constructions. But when viewed from a certain point, or through a reflecting object placed upon it, the hidden image appears in its true shape, that is, it goes through retransformation. \nOrosz made experiments with anamorphoses not only in resurrecting the old technique but to improve and develop it. Instead of having a meaningless distorted image, his intent is to bring sense to the basic anamorphic picture, giving it meaning in itself with its second reading being revealed by viewing it from a different viewpoint such as looking at it through a special mirror.\nThe ambiguous layers coming up by this approach make use of the connection or contrast of the two images within the same picture being independent from each other.\nThere are many other contemporary works using hidden faces:\n\n\nThe pioneering study on the matter is an academic dissertation, unpublished to this day: Anita Joplin, \"The Anthropomorphic Landscape: A Study in 16th Century Imagery\" (unpublished thesis, Reed College), 1974.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7146282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7146282", "title": "Humanitarian use licenses", "text": "Humanitarian use licenses\n\nHumanitarian use licenses are provisions in a license whereby inventors and technology suppliers protect in advance the possibility of sharing their technology with people in need. Thus, humanitarian use licenses set the conditions for the provision of access to innovations for people in need at a royalty free basis or at lower costs. Humanitarian use licenses assure that products of research and development stay publicly available and that at the same time the incentive function of exclusive intellectual property rights are maintained.\n\nHumanitarian use licenses represent a tool to distribute the outcomes of Research & Development more equally. They relax the exclusive claims of intellectual property rights with more permissive licenses for developing countries. Intellectual property (IP) is an umbrella term for various legal entitlements which attach to certain types of information, ideas, or other intangibles in their expressed form. The term intellectual property reflects the idea that this subject matter is the product of the mind or the intellect, and that IP rights may be protected at law in the same way as any other form of property. Understanding the political reality of IP includes a realization that IP is originally a Western notion currently being introduced into other parts of the world. This is necessary to understand why IP law has severe difficulty in taking hold in non-western societies in general and in developing countries in particular. More understanding is required of the differences between economic sectors and the respective roles and functions of public versus private institutions in society. (Egelyng)\n\nThere are several functions related to IPR that make them work as a catalyst for the market. But there are also fundamental differences between the economic and social conditions of developed countries and developing countries. Hence, conventional licensing practices have caused distortions that make humanitarian use licenses a tool worth considering.\n\nThe holder of a legal Intellectual Property Right is generally entitled to exclude others from using his IP for a period of time. This gives the owner a comparative advantage over others for a limited time. Thus, innovative activity is rewarded, which stimulates R&D and improves the life of all.\n\nBut many developing countries are characterized by a weak Research & Development sector. Of the 400,000 inventions for which patent applications are submitted annually, developing countries take part in 1 percent whereas the USA, the USSR, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Japan participate in 73 percent. (Vestry Besarovic) This makes the industrial sector of developing countries largely dependent on imitation. Universally imposed minimum standards of patent protection, as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights requires, are not likely to contribute to economic growth unless a particular level of development has been achieved (Thompson and Rushing). When developing countries have to purchase expensive technology because of a protective regime to comply with TRIPS, it can lead to the breakup of industries and thus reduce economic growth.\n\nThe existence of IPR protection over a collaborative research effort facilitates inter-firm Research & Development collaboration. Transaction costs are minimized as it is clear which intellectual property belongs to whom. So it is commonly assumed that patents stimulate the emergence of markets.\n\nBut whether transaction costs hinder development also depends on whether there is a sufficient resource commitment from industry. This factor influences the relative price of a patent and its relative utility. In economies that have to rely on imitation, clear IP laws are unlikely to stimulate innovation. Rather, they often discourage it. IP protection gains importance at higher stages of development when it serves to stimulate. Until this stage is reached, the relative benefits for facilitating transactions will not outweigh the relative costs of hindering technology application.\n\nPatent applications must disclose how the claimed invention functions. This disclosure allows persons skilled in the art to make use of the innovation. As new technologies are applied, further innovations can be built on existing ones.\n\nBut rates of secondary and university education are much lower in developing countries than they are in developed countries. Along with the lack of capital flows into Research & Development, this lowers the potential for adoption of new technology and the development of innovations. Thus, the information disclosed in a patent becomes useless, as the preconditions for taking advantage of the information do not exist in developing countries.\n\nThe effects of the globally imbalanced power relations are best illustrated by looking at sectors strongly concerned with IPR, medicine and agriculture. These sectors are also crucial for development as they serve the basic needs of people.\n\nHere, intellectual property practices can be harmful as they cover consumer products. For example, patent protection for drugs keeps the price high and inhibits competitors from introducing cheaper generic versions.\n\nIn agriculture, the patenting of genes or certain properties of crops can make the use of these crops costly and burdensome. Access to varieties that have long been used by farmers can be restricted, and as a result markets can be destroyed. An illustrative example for this is the case of the Enola bean, where a field bean variety showing a certain colour was patented. Subsequently, the licensor required all importers of Mexican beans to pay royalties, which would have caused a significant drop in export sales of beans from Mexico.\n\nBut IP protection may also hinder development in intermediate stages, as it covers not only final products, but also intermediate products, processes and tools to create those products. Thus, IP protections covering biotechnology can decrease the development of and access to new technologies in developing countries, thus preventing new crops or drugs from being developed.\n\nMoreover, drugs for tropical diseases and crops adapted to tropical conditions have been developed only to a limited extent. The purchasing power in these countries is low and thus there are no lucrative markets. Although only 10% of the global disease load occurs within industrialised countries, 90 percent of global drug R&D investment goes toward the drugs for industrialized countries. R&D projects that address diseases of developing countries such as malaria and tuberculosis receive comparatively little funding.\n\nOf course, HUL and improved management of IPR on its own do not solve the development problems of developing countries. But considering HUL when making contracts can help to decrease the shown inequalities of the world market. Especially for the example of the previous paragraph, the agricultural and medical sector, it can be illustrated what impact a humanitarian use exemption can have.\n\nTechnologies can be provided that stimulate the development of needed and to local conditions adapted products. Companies and research institutes in the specific countries are able to produce and develop at lower costs and know the local needs and problems best. This stimulates also future Research & Development as it creates learning by doing effects, thereby generating additional resources, ideas, and needs that fuel more innovation and technology creation. Technology can benefit the poor farmer or the sick people that are in need of drugs or food as well as the economy as a whole by stimulating Research & Development.\n\nHumanitarian Use Licenses have the potential to enhance the supply of important consumer products. When cheap or cost free licenses are granted to companies in developing countries, it would be possible for them to produce copies of drugs or seeds to provide the population with. Apart from missing royalty payments companies in developing countries will possibly be able to produce and distribute at a much lower price than companies in wealthier countries.\n\nDefining the population that should benefit and the institutions that can serve the needs of this population is required in the humanitarian use licensing scheme. Depending on the different technologies that should be assigned via the Humanitarian Use License, there are different approaches of how to formulate a Humanitarian Use License. Below there are some examples of strategies of how a Humanitarian Use License can be assigned.\n\nAssigning a non-exclusive license means to retain the freedom to assign licenses also to other parties. The terms under which additional licensing is provided can be fixed beforehand, thus securing the situation for the licensee. Defining humanitarian use could mean that the licensor is only permitted to assign additional licenses to countries in certain regions or that are i.e. classified as least developed countries.\n\nPublic Private Partnerships are projects that private sector companies and the government jointly fund and operate. Governmental involvement can be seen as giving an incentive for private companies to engage in R&D activities that they otherwise would not have carried out. Transferring technology to Public Private Partnerships for product development for neglected markets or neglected diseases is a way of facilitating the work of Public Private Partnerships, enabling them the development of adapted products.\n\nFor the development of adapted technologies a direct partnership between companies, universities or research institutions of developed and developing countries can be established. Partners in developing countries will have a greater interest to meet the needs of these countries.\n\nGovernments or foundations that fund research can require that the outcomes will be free for humanitarian licensing. The establishment of those clauses secures that later negotiations will be held with clear expectations.\n\nMeasuring the progress and the impact of a project can be done by the inclusion of performance milestones. An example of a humanitarian licensing mile stone is i.e. the condition that on or before the date of the first phase of a clinical trial for a new drug, the licensee will have identified a generic manufacturer in a middle-income country to produce the licensed technology at a reasonable price for developing countries. Subsequently, if this milestone is not met, other provisions and reservations in the agreement would be triggered, for example loss of exclusivity, sublicensing, exercise of march-in rights, and even termination of the agreement. (Brewster, Chapman, Hansen)\n\nAccess to a product can be assured when the licensor requires that products are sold at the markets in developing countries to a price, people can afford there. an appropriate price may be set by having i.e. the production costs plus a small profit of about 5-10%.\n\nStimulating the research of products that are adapted to the conditions in developing countries can be achieved when clauses that exclude particular categories of research from infringement are integrated into licensing agreements.\n\nBy including reach through clauses, new technologies, based on the licensed one, will be treated under the same licensing conditions that cover the original license. Thus, intermediate technologies, genes or processes can be maintained available for licensing for humanitarian licensing.\n\nA “non suit” agreement is an agreement that an IP holder will not assert these IP rights against one or more parties to the agreement. (Kaplan) The advantage for institutions or companies granting innovations is that they won't have to fear any liability by using these clauses. For example, companies may hesitate to grant i.e. genetic material to research institutions, as they might fear any claims that can be made based on international agreements like the Cartagena protocol, that force companies into the responsibility to care for the material they distribute. A way out of this situation is a non-assert clause that can be introduced in transfer agreements, stating that\n\nHUL do interfere with the exclusive claims that are connected with Intellectual Property Rights. That might cause companies to fear loss of revenues. However, this is not necessarily the case, as mostly non-commercial markets are served with HUL. People are provided with royalty free goods that otherwise would not have made the purchase in the first place.\n\nDonating technology and supporting Research & Development for developing countries will cause positive publicity for companies that do so, especially in the biotechnology and medical sectors. This can be reinforced if also governments take a role in this. Promoting positive publicity by giving prices or tax incentives are possible ways to reward companies that are engaged in underserved sectors.\n\nMany developing countries have a growing potential private market for technologies. The technology supplier may plan to develop these growing markets as part of a long-term market strategy, implying that the supplier expects these currently unprofitable markets to become profitable in the future. Thus, the supplier can create a loyal customer base in the future with a generous donation today (IP strategies 2001)\n\nHumanitarian use licences could be compulsorily assigned by the government or subject to voluntary implementation by the patent holder. However, developing standards in humanitarian licensing that encourages also private companies to technology transfers would rather stimulate the voluntarily engagement of the private sector in Research & Development in development. Thus, resources would be directed into more productive channels than compulsory licensing could do. Building trust of partners can be achieved by careful drafted clauses that an Intellectual Property Rights holder could choose to include in licensing agreements.\n\nAnytime a targeting mechanism fails to exclude unintended beneficiaries, leakage occurs and the cost of the donation to the supplier can increase. With regard to lost markets, the cost of such a failure depends on how many farmers included in the target would have purchased the technology from the market had they not been granted preferential access via HUTT (IP strategy 2001) Leakage of the technology to unintended beneficiaries is possible, even probable as the experience of food transfers has shown how difficult it can be to reach the intended beneficiaries. Precisely defining the intended beneficiaries and establishing the right mechanism to reach them to reduce leakage to a minimum is essential to successful HUL as thereby more goods reach people in need and the loss for the supplier will be minimal which ensures a stable partnership. A trade-off between the effort to administer the targeting scheme and the size of leakage is probable – the lower the risk of leakage should be, the higher will be the cost of implementation of these targeting schemes.\n\nOf particular concern are countries with a wide income disparity, where for example viable commercial markets may exist in the cities, while rural areas are underserved and require a humanitarian license and a significantly different price-point.\n\nSo far not many examples of humanitarian use licenses are available. There is a general formulated template of a HUL available at the PIPRA website and in articles such as Kaplan (2006). Some language can be found that could serve as template for more tailored clauses. The Central Advisory Service on Intellectual Property Rights (CAS-IP) of the Group of International Agricultural Research is currently preparing a website that will offer standard templates of HUL for various market segmentation strategies. In July 2011, the Natural Innovation .org produced a first draft of a Humanitarian License that it hopes will become an open source standard. The formulation of HUL templates is an important step into the direction of a broader application of HUL. Creating commonly recognized language for HUL would make it more easy for IP holders to grant their property to people in need as time consuming negotiations and formulations of contractual language and market segmentation approaches would cease to apply.\n\nWhether for intermediate or for final products – Humanitarian use licenses should be considered in every stage of development as IPR can restrict the access to materials, processes for product development or final products of Research & Development. Patents can be granted with respect to whole varieties, single genes or procedures that permit the isolation of genes. Humanitarian Use Licenses therefore do not only concern companies that bring products to the market and could via such licenses directly deliver people in need. It has to be considered also by Universities, National and International Agricultural Research Centres and Public Private Partnerships whose work represents the basis for further upstream research.\n\n\n"}

Directed by Jonas Åkerlund, the film premiered on MTV on October 21, 2005, and was released on DVD on June 20, 2006, by Warner Bros. Records. The documentary was originally called \"The Re-Invented Process\", referencing the tour and the Steven Klein exhibition titled \"X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS\". It starts with imagery from the exhibition and Madonna auditioning dancers for the tour, continues with her entourage travelling through different cities and performing, the singer's introspection on her life, her marriage, her religion, and her children, and ends with Madonna's visit to Israel in the midst of protests.\n\nThe documentary was inspired by Madonna's need to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary \"\", which portrayed Hollywood glamour, \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" clarified from its beginning that it was about the singer's personal views on life and spirituality. Like \"Truth or Dare\", the performance scenes were shot in color, while the rest of the film was in black-and-white. Besides Madonna, her dancers and her tour entourage, Åkerlund also shot her family, her working process and her day-to-day life. Madonna and her then-husband Guy Ritchie's local pub in Mayfair, London was used for some sequences. The film features appearances from Madonna's father, stepmother and filmmaker Michael Moore.\n\nBefore releasing the documentary, Madonna invited a select group of friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill. The film was trimmed after negative feedback regarding excessive details about Kabbalah. For the promotion and premiere of the film, Madonna appeared at Q&A sessions with the press and also gave a speech to film students at New York's Hunter College. Critical response to \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" was mixed, with reviewers complimenting the live performances and the scenes involving her children and family, but criticizing the self-indulgent and preachy nature. \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" was released in a two-disc format, a CD with 14 songs from the show and a DVD with the documentary film. It received a positive response from critics but was a moderate success commercially.\n\nThe documentary begins with scenes from the X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS, with Madonna featured as a queen sitting beside a coyote. The intro is followed by the singer recording vocals with music director Stuart Price and auditioning dancers for the Re-Invention World Tour.\n\nAfter the first show of the tour at The Forum in Inglewood, California, Madonna attends a party with her dancers celebrating the success of the opening night. The tour moves to New York City with more rehearsal footage and Madonna asking her dancers to register for voting in the upcoming elections. Guy Ritchie jokes around with Madonna as she gets ready for the performance at Madison Square Garden, while Michael Moore appears in an interview segment, recalling how Madonna thanked him during the concert for his documentary.\n\nIn Chicago, Madonna's father Tony Ciccone is interviewed in his vineyard; he recalls Madonna's childhood. Ciccone and his wife Joan come to visit the singer at her concert in United Center. The entourage moves to Miami where Ritchie is shown angling with their son Rocco, plays with her daughter Lourdes, and Madonna reflects on relationships and her husband. By the time the tour reaches London, Madonna gets irritated with the journeys. Kabbalah comes into the picture with explanations of the mystical practice from Madonna and her teacher Eitan. At Slane Castle, Dublin, Madonna and her dancers were in danger of being electrocuted due to constant rain, but she nevertheless continued the performances.\n\nIn Paris, Madonna takes her dancers for a classical piano recital by Katia and Marielle Labèque. After the performance at Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, the tour reaches its final stop at Lisbon. The dancers are shown enjoying the beach and talking about their future plans. With a final performance of \"Holiday\", the Re-Invention World Tour ends. At an after party, Madonna recites a poem for her assistant Angie.\n\nThe final segment of the documentary shows Madonna arriving at Tel Aviv, Israel, amidst protests of her visit. She gives a speech at a benefit for her charity foundation, Spirituality For Kids. She speaks of compassion, peace and giving children all the benefits that they deserve. Then Madonna visits Rachel's Tomb on the outskirts of Bethlehem and offers her prayers. The documentary ends then, with a parting shot of an Israeli child and a Palestinian child walking down a road together as Madonna's voice over tells that the audience has learnt her \"secret\".\n\nThe Re-Invention World Tour was the sixth concert tour by Madonna. It supported her ninth studio album \"American Life\", and visited North America and Europe. Madonna was inspired to create the tour, after taking part in an art installation called X-STaTIC PRo=CeSS, directed by photographer Steven Klein. A number of songs were rehearsed for the tour, with twenty-four of them making the final setlist. The tour was divided into five segments: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal. The costumes were developed by designer Arianne Phillips based on the concept of re-invention. The opening segment displayed performances with dance in general. \"Military\" segment displayed performances with the theme of warfare. \"Circus\" displayed light-hearted performances while the \"Acoustic\" segment performances were melancholy. The final \"Scottish\" segment had Madonna and her performers display energetic dance routines.\n\nThe tour garnered positive reception from contemporary critics. However, fellow singer Elton John accused Madonna of lip-synching on the tour. Madonna's representatives denied the allegations and John later apologized. The Re-Invention World Tour was a commercial success. Tickets were completely sold as soon as dates and venues for the tour were announced, prompting the organizers to add more dates. After conclusion, it was named the highest-grossing concert tour of 2004, earning $125 million ($ million in dollars) from 56 shows with an audience 900,000. It won the honor of Top Tour at the 2004 Billboard Touring Awards.\n\nThe tour was chronicled in the documentary titled \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\". Originally called \"The Re-Invented Process\" in reference to the tour and the exhibition \"X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS\", the documentary was filmed during Madonna's visit to North America and Europe from May 24 to September 14, 2004. It was directed by Jonas Åkerlund, whose previous endeavors included music videos, commercials and the cult film, \"Spun\" (2003). The documentary emerged from Madonna's urge to show her artistic side on the tour and her devotion towards the Jewish mysticism Kabbalah. Unlike her 1991 documentary, \"\", which portrayed Hollywood glamour, \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" clarified from its beginning that it was about the singer's views on life and spirituality. \"It's a different me, I have a husband, I have a family, my whole life has changed. It would be pretty strange if I was behaving the same way I did 12 years ago — that would be a little freaky. No more Evian bottles!\", Madonna told MTV, with the last bit referring to a scene of her performing fellatio on an Evian bottle in \"Truth or Dare\".\n\nLike \"Truth or Dare\", the performance scenes were shot in color, while the rest of the documentary was in black-and-white. Besides Madonna, her dancers and her tour entourage, Åkerlund also shot her family, her working process and her day-to-day life. Locations shot included Madonna and her husband Guy Ritchie's local pub in Mayfair, London. There was also an appearance from filmmaker Michael Moore, her father Tony Ciccone and stepmother Joan Ciccone. In some scenes, Ritchie was shown missing some of Madonna's concerts and going out for drinks, which drove the singer to tears. In December 2005, Madonna told \"Rolling Stone\":\n\n[My relationship with Guy] came off as peculiar [in the documentary]. Not a typical relationship. A lot of macho men see the movie and like Guy's character, because he doesn't give me any special treatment. I think we come off as a couple that has that has a genuine and deep connection. He is always there for me, but he's not impressed. I feel like we are sort of \"The Honeymooners\", only I'm the Jackie Gleason character. Obviously, he irritates me on a significant basis, as everyone's significant other does.\n\nReferring to the incidents in the pub, Madonna explained her view on relationships where a man has to travel with his wife, while giving an example of her friend, actress Gwyneth Paltrow. She said that it was easier for Paltrow to tour with her then-husband, Chris Martin, who is the lead singer of the alternative rock band, Coldplay. Madonna also recalled her troubled relationship with her father and how he had e-mailed the singer with his approval, after watching the documentary. Kabbalah featured prominently towards the end and the singer wanted to embark on a spiritual pilgrimage to Israel. However, ultra-orthodox Jews protested her trip, saying that Madonna disgraced Judaism with her portrayal of wearing phylacteries over her arm—a Jewish custom usually reserved for men—in the music video of her 2002 single \"Die Another Day\", before escaping from an electric chair on which Hebrew letters spell out one of the 72 sacred names of God. Although Israeli securities had advised the singer against the trip, she nevertheless visited graves of Jewish sages in northern Israel as well as shrines such as Rachel's Tomb on the edge of Bethlehem, traditional burial place of the biblical matriarch Rachel.\n\nMoore had initially offered to direct the documentary, though Madonna enlisted Åkerlund as director since Moore was busy with his own project, \"Fahrenheit 9/11\". Moore later said that he could help around with the editing and advised Madonna to shoot \"as much content as possible\". \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" was an important film for Madonna, who was determined to show her matured persona through the documentary. She had a meagre budget of one million ($ million in dollars) for production. The singer had to spend time in the editing room with Åkerlund, analyzing all the shots and creating the final version. Side-by-side Madonna had also started working on her tenth studio album, \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\", juggling time between editing the film and recording. Madonna had to fly to Stockholm for the editing and described pruning the 350-hour footage into a two-hour documentary as \"exhaustive\". She recalled her thoughts during that time:\n\nI was sitting there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just worrying the whole way, biting my fingernails off.\nBefore releasing the film, Madonna invited a group of friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill, and noted their feedback. General consensus was that there was too much of Kabbalah in the film, hence she decided to prune those segments considerably. The documentary premiered on MTV in the United States, on October 21, 2005, at 10:00 PM. She also showed it to the film students at New York's Hunter College and appeared for a Q&A session. This promotion was a part of mtvU's \"Stand In\" series, in which celebrities filled in for college professors.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the documentary premiered on Channel 4 on December 14, 2005. \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" was not released commercially and was only viewed on MTV and Channel 4. Åkerlund told \"BlackBook\" that he wished more people had the chance to see the documentary because according to him, it is \"a really strong piece of art, if you ask me. ... . it had a lot of my blood, sweat and tears in it.\"\n\n\"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" received mixed reviews from critics. O'Brien noted how the film revealed a \"strange isolation at the cost of stardom\" from Madonna. She complimented the scenes featuring her father, and the scenes where Madonna was not self-conscious, like when she interacts with her children, talks about her \"fat Italian thighs\" and also the performance in rain at Dublin. O'Brien criticized other portions of the film, which she said was \"affected\" by conscious behavior in front of the camera, like backstage parties, poem and piano recitals. Author J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote in his book \"\" that the film allowed a much closer look at the singer's family. He was particularly impressed by the scenes featuring Lourdes, believing that she \"revealed herself to be sophisticated beyond her years\". Kathryn Flett from \"The Observer\" newspaper described it as \"Fascinating, [it has] tiny flashes of insight into her relationship with [Ritchie], which occasionally involve her being just as girlie and ever so slightly insecure as the rest of us.\" Rupert Smith from \"The Guardian\" reported that the director \"squeezed every last drop of spectacle from a highly stage-managed performance\", but commented that \"she gave away far more in 1991's \"In Bed with Madonna\"; this time she gave only the illusion of candour\". However, he complimented saying \"Even the easy-to-mock pre-show prayers brought a tear to the eye. We don't need to be told that 'there's more to life than fame and fortune – something deeper, more profound', or that 'the material world' is a bad thing. But it's good to see an entertainer who, 20 years into her career, is still trying to change the world\".\nBarry Walters from \"Rolling Stone\" mentioned that \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" \"lacks the dishy delights of the diva's 1991 \"Truth or Dare\" doc. Instead, a more worldly Madge struggles to become a less sound-bite-reliant, more sincere person.\" Darryl Sterdan from \"Jam!\" gave it three out of five stars, saying that \"it still sucks to sit through all that video and see almost as much of her limo as her show ... For a start, how about giving us a [movie] that isn't derivative and self-indulgent?\" Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website opined that \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" would find a divided audience and how one reacted to the documentary was a reflection of how one viewed Madonna. \"Fans like me will be able to essentially ignore the self-serving moments and enjoy the tour elements. We'll also like the glimpse behind the curtain at Madonna on the road,\" he added. This view was shared by a reviewer from \"Lexington Herald-Leader\" who confessed that he did not enjoy the documentary except the live performances, since he saw Madonna only as an \"entertainer\" and not as a \"preacher\".\n\nWhile reviewing \"Madonna: The Confessions Tour Live\" TV debut in 2007, Ginia Bellafante from \"The New York Times\" recalled the scenes of Madonna hugging her assistants and dancers and her wishing to be nicer to people she had met. She said that probably Madonna knew that many in her audience missed the \"Madonna of so many Madonnas ago, the one who refused refinement and probably thought Oxford was just an insurance company.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic believed that the documentary served its purpose well. \"It will convince anybody who is on the fence about going out to see the 2006 tour to go ahead and buy those expensive tickets already,\" he added.\n\nStephen M. Deusner from \"Pitchfork\" panned the release, saying that \"[Madonna's] life as portrayed in this documentary is cloistered and withdrawn, marked by hours of quiet Kabbalah study but very little self-reflection. Whether intentionally or not, Åkerlund reveals Madonna's supreme lack of self-awareness, from her embarrassing attempts at poetry to the condescending tone she takes with her dancers to her incredibly irresponsible visit to Rachel's Tomb despite the warnings of her host country and her security team.\" He ended the review noting that Madonna did not need to prove anything further, since her songs \"have become a shared language among people who have very little common ground. Her music has been changing the world for more than two decades now, but sadly she seems unaware of this, her one true 'secret' to pop cultural unity.\"\n\n\"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\" was released in a two-disc format, a CD with 14 songs from the show and a DVD with the documentary film. The documentary and the album were also released as digital download to the iTunes Store. The live CD consisted of two pre-recorded tracks, \"The Beast Within\" and \"Hollywood\" while extras on the DVD included 12 deleted scenes from the documentary. The release received positive response from critics and was nominated for a Grammy Award at the 2007 show in the category of Best Long Form Music Video, but ended up losing the award to \"\" by Bruce Springsteen. It was a moderate success commercially, reaching the top-ten of the music charts in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland, while the DVD topped the video charts in Australia, Spain and the United States.\n\n"}

It is often used by technology activists to criticize laws that limit transparency and general access to information. People who criticize intellectual property law say the system of such government granted monopolies conflicts with the development of a public domain of information. The expression is often credited to Stewart Brand, who was recorded saying it at a hackers conference in 1984.\n\nThe iconic phrase is attributed to Stewart Brand, who, in the late 1960s, founded the Whole Earth Catalog and argued that technology could be liberating rather than oppressing. The earliest recorded occurrence of the expression was at the first Hackers Conference in 1984. Brand told Steve Wozniak:\n\nBrand's conference remarks are transcribed in the \"Whole Earth Review\" (May 1985, p. 49) and a later form appears in his \"The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at MIT\":\n\nAccording to historian Adrian Johns, the slogan expresses a view that had already been articulated in the mid-20th century by Norbert Wiener, Michael Polanyi and Arnold Plant, who advocated for the free communication of scientific knowledge, and specifically criticized the patent system. \n\nThe various forms of the original statement are ambiguous: the slogan can be used to argue the benefits of propertied information, of liberated, free, and open information, or of both. It can be taken amorally as an expression of a fact of information-science: once information has passed to a new location outside of the source's control there is no way of ensuring it is not propagated further, and therefore will naturally tend towards a state where that information is widely distributed. Much of its force is due to the anthropomorphic metaphor that imputes desire to information. In 1990 Richard Stallman restated the concept normatively, without the anthropomorphization:\n\nStallman's reformulation incorporates a political stance into Brand's value-neutral observation of social trends.\n\nBrand's attribution of will to an abstract human construct (information) has been adopted within a branch of the cyberpunk movement, whose members espouse a particular political (anarchist) viewpoint. The construction of the statement takes its meaning beyond the simple judgmental observation, \"Information \"should\" be free\" by acknowledging that the internal force or entelechy of information and knowledge makes it essentially incompatible with notions of proprietary software, copyrights, patents, subscription services, etc. They believe that information is dynamic, ever-growing and evolving and cannot be contained within (any) ideological structure.\n\nAccording to this philosophy, hackers, crackers, and phreakers are liberators of information which is being held hostage by agents demanding money for its release. Other participants in this network include cypherpunks who educate people to use public-key cryptography to protect the privacy of their messages from corporate or governmental snooping and programmers who write free software and open source code. Still others create Free-Nets allowing users to gain access to computer resources for which they would otherwise need an account. They might also break copyright law by swapping music, movies, or other copyrighted materials over the Internet.\n\nChelsea Manning is alleged to have said \"Information should be free\" to Adrian Lamo when explaining a rationale for US government documents to be released to WikiLeaks. The narrative goes on with Manning wondering if she is a \"'hacker', 'cracker', 'hacktivist', 'leaker' or what\".\n\nIn the \"Fall Revolution\" series of science-fiction books, anarchist sci-fi author Ken Macleod riffs and puns on the expression by writing about entities composed of information actually \"wanting\", as in desiring, freedom and the scheming of several human characters with differing political and ideological agenda, to facilitate or disrupt these entities' quest for freedom.\n\nIn the cyberpunk world of post-singularity transhuman culture described by Charles Stross in his books like \"Accelerando\" and \"Singularity Sky\", the wish of information to be free is a law of nature.\n\n\n"}

Virtually nothing is known of the monk beyond what the preface offers us. The compilation was written sometime between 636, when the important source Isidore of Seville died, and about 750, when the earliest extant manuscript appears to have been produced.\n\nThe \"sparks\" (\"scintillae\") of the title refer to sayings (such as maxims and proverbs) of the Lord and his saints, which have been excerpted from the Bible and the Church Fathers, and rearranged into as many as 81 chapters. The headings of these chapters refer mainly to vices (e.g. avarice, fornication), virtues (patience, wisdom), devotional practices (confession, prayer) and common themes of human life (marriage, feasting).\n\nIn the early part of the eleventh century, a copy of the Latin text was accompanied by an interlinear Old English gloss, for which a little space between the lines was available.

{"id": "19711763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19711763", "title": "Martha Colburn", "text": "Martha Colburn\n\nMartha Colburn is a filmmaker and artist. She is best known for her animation films, which are created through puppetry, collage, and paint on glass techniques. She also makes installations and performs her films with live musical performance. Yet music and film have always shared a deep connection within Colburn’s work.\n\nColburn spent her childhood near the Appalachian Mountains between Gettysburg and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. She began making art at a very young age, but did not start working with film until 1994. In an interview with \"Blank Screen Media\", Colburn discusses her past and present influences for making art: \"In high school it was politics and history and then in my twenties I made around 50 music films and now I am back to the political and historical films.\"\nColburn left the Appalachians to attended the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore. Her primary focus in school was visual arts, yet she also began to become involved in the Baltimore experimental music scene. Although disillusioned by the time she graduated in 1994, Colburn nevertheless decided to stay in Baltimore and further immerse herself in the city’s artistic community.\nIt was around the time of finishing college that Colburn first began to work with film. Her motivation to work with film arose partially from finding 16mm reels of old educational movies. \"Acrophobic Babies\" and \"Feature Presentation\" are two early examples of Colburn working within this process. By scratching, tinting, and splicing the film itself, Colburn made her first filmic pieces through her manipulation of appropriated imagery.\nAfter discovering Super-8 in 1995, Colburn switched from 16mm to 8mm. Her initial explorations in puppetry and animation are simultaneous with her shift in film formats. \"Caffeine Jam\" is one of her first animated films, while \"Killer Tunes\" is animation using marionettes. Colburn continues to develop and enrich her animation to an even greater complexity of form, materials, and concepts. During an interview with \"Metropolis M Magazine\", Colburn asserted her love for animation: \"animation is magical, it’s making gold out of glitter.\"\nAfter ten years of living in Baltimore, Colburn moved to Amsterdam in 2000 after being offered a two-year residency at the Rijksakademie. During her residency, Colburn made numerous films including \"Skelehellavision\", an animated and hand-colored film mixing images of female pornography stars and skulls, and \"Big Bug Attack\", a film whose soundtrack was a collaborative piece between Colburn and German techno artist Felix Kubin. Once finishing up her residency, Colburn spent another three years in the Netherlands making films until returning to the United States in 2005.\nOnce settling between Long Island City, New York and Amsterdam, NL, Colburn began work on films that dealt more closely with American history and its relationship to the country’s foreign and domestic policies. \"Destiny Manifesto\" incorporates images of the American frontier with depictions of the conflict in the Middle East. \"Meet Me in Wichita\" is a parody of The \"Wizard of Oz\" in which Osama Bin Laden substitutes for all of Oz’s characters aside from Dorothy, the story’s heroine. \"I am making films that work with ideas of the loss of faith, obsession with spectacle, self destructiveness, compulsion for violence,\" Colburn said in Metropolis M Magazine about her work of most recent years. \"Inhibition and fear characterize my work, as uninhibited and fearless they may appear.\" As far as the effects of returning to her native country after spending time in Europe, Colburn believes her work has gotten increasingly concerned with political issues facing the world today.\nColburn has also used animation for music videos. She created pieces to accompany the San Francisco-based band Deerhoof’s song \"Wrong Time Capsule\" in 2005 and Serj Tankian’s \"Lie, Lie, Lie\" in 2007. Yet these projects come as no surprise given the strong relationship Colburn has always had with music. She even created animation for the 2005 documentary about the musician Daniel Johnston entitled The Devil and Daniel Johnston. Colburn’s latest film, Myth Labs, has not just been screened, but also presented as panels of which the film is composed.\n\nColburn’s style of collage fuses pop culture and political imagery with an aesthetic that is simultaneously fantastical, painterly, and punk rock. Many of her appropriated images are painted over with a diverse variety of paints which integrate them with the drawings and textures that are completely her own. Colburn animated by facing the camera directly downward at the collaged panels below. The \"hands-on,\" non-technological quality that defines her process keeps her films at a personal and intimate level. Color is another very important aspect of Colburn’s films. Although her 2006 film Meet Me in Wichita deals with disconcerting subject matter, Colburn still chooses bright colors to define the film’s color scheme. It is these types of contradictions in Colburn’s work which deepen her visual and conceptual complexity. Colburn was featured in the April 2011 issue of Art In America.\n\n\n\n\n\n15. https://web.archive.org/web/20130403135513/http://lancasteronline.com/article/local/831653_Experimental-filmmaker-finds-new-ways-to-tell-stories.html\n"}
{"id": "689551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=689551", "title": "Oregon Shakespeare Festival", "text": "Oregon Shakespeare Festival\n\nThe Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF) is a regional repertory theatre in Ashland, Oregon, United States. Each year, the Festival produces eleven plays, usually from three to five by Shakespeare and the remainder by other playwrights, on three stages during an eight-month season beginning in mid-February. From its inception in 1935 through the end of the 2017 season (excepting the war years 1941–1946) the Festival has presented all 37 of Shakespeare's plays a total of 312 times and beginning in 1960, 341 non-Shakespeare plays for a total of over 30,000 performances. It has completed the complete Shakespeare canon of 37 plays in 1958, 1978, 1997, and 2016. The Festival welcomed its millionth visitor in 1971, its 10-millionth in 2001, and its 20-millionth visitor in 2015. A complete list by year and theater is available at the \"Main article:\" Production history of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.\n\n A season at OSF consists of a wide range of classic and contemporary plays produced in three theatres. Three plays are staged in the outdoor Allen Elizabethan Theatre, three in the Thomas Theatre, and five in the Angus Bowmer Theatre. OSF also provides a broad range of educational programs for middle schools, high schools, college students, teachers, and theatre professionals. While OSF has produced non-Shakespearean works since 1960, each season continues to include three to five Shakespeare plays. Since 1935, it has staged Shakespeare's complete canon three times, completing the first cycle in 1958 with a production of \"Troilus and Cressida\" and completing the second and third cycles in 1978 and 1997. Since 2000, there has also been at least one new work each season from playwrights such as Octavio Solis and Robert Schenkkan.\n\nEach year, the Festival offers 750 to 800 performances from February through late October or early November, to a total audience of about 400,000. The company consists of about 675 paid staff and 700 volunteers. The Oregon Shakespeare Festival is listed as a Major Festival in the book \"Shakespeare Festivals Around the World\".\n\nIn addition to the plays, beginning in 1951 a free outdoor \"Green Show\" drawing audiences of 600 to 1200, often including non-playgoers, has preceded the evening plays from June through October from a modular steel stage with a sprung floor for the dancers, a removable wheelchair ramp for performers with disabilities, and built-in storage facilities that eliminate carting equipment from and to distant storage facilities six days a week. Originally, it offered Elizabethan music and dancers. From 1966 till 2007, it consisted of three Renaissance-themed shows in rotation inspired by the plays showing in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre. Live music was supplied by the Terra Nova Consort and other guest musicians and modern dance was performed by Dance Kaleidoscope. In 2008, the Green Show was revamped. The nightly shows now vary widely with performers such as a dance group from Mexico or India one night, clowns doing ballet on stilts the next, and a classical music quartet on another. A fire show, juggler, or magician might be seen along with improv, metal, or rock-n-roll variations on Shakespeare. Individual performers, groups, choirs, bands, and orchestras may present Afro-Cuban, baroque, blues, classical, contemporary, cowboy, funk, gospel, hip-hop, jazz, mariachi, marimba, poetry, marionette, renaissance, or salsa, sometimes combined in unexpected ways.\nIn 1893, the residents of Ashland built a facility to host Chautauqua events. In its heyday, it accommodated audiences of 1,500 for appearances by the likes of John Philip Sousa and William Jennings Bryan during annual 10-day seasons.\n\nIn 1917, a new domed structure was built at the site, but it fell into disrepair after the Chautauqua movement died out in the 1920s. In 1935, the similarity of the remaining wall of the then roofless Chautauqua building to Elizabethan theatres inspired Southern Oregon Normal School drama professor Angus L. Bowmer to propose using it to present plays by Shakespeare. Ashland city leaders loaned him a sum \"not to exceed $400\" (approximately equivalent to $ in 2014) to present two plays as part of the city's Independence Day celebration. However, they pressed Bowmer to add boxing matches to cover the expected deficit. Bowmer agreed, feeling such an event was in perfect keeping with the bawdiness of Elizabethan theatre, and the performances went forward. The Works Progress Administration helped construct a makeshift Elizabethan stage on the Chautauqua site, and confidently billing it as the \"First Annual Oregon Shakespearean Festival\", Bowmer presented \"Twelfth Night\" on July 2 and July 4, 1935, and \"The Merchant of Venice\" on July 3, directing and playing the lead roles in both plays himself. Reserved seats cost $1, with general admission of $.50 for adults and $.25 for children (approximately equivalent to $17, $8.50 and $4.25 in 2014). Ironically, the profit from the plays covered the losses the boxing matches incurred.\nThe Festival has continued ever since (excepting 1941–1946 while Bowmer served in World War II), and quickly developed a reputation for quality productions. Angus Bowmer's first wife Lois served as art director, creating both costumes and scenery during the formative years of the Festival from 1935 to 1940 years. In 1939, OSF took a production of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" to the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco that was nationally broadcast on radio. The lead actress, learning at the last minute the broadcast would be to a national audience, suffered a panic attack, was rushed to the hospital and the stand-in took over. The scripts didn't arrive on the set until three minutes before air time. The Festival achieved widespread national recognition when, from 1951 to 1973, NBC broadcast abbreviated performances each year that were carried by more than 100 stations and, after 1954 on Armed Forces Radio and Radio Free Europe. The programs won favorable review from critics and people began to come from around the country. The programs led Life magazine to do a story on the Festival in 1957, bringing even more people to the plays. The NBC programs and the subsequent attention go a long way to explaining the mystery of how a tiny out-of-the-way timber town in the Northwest became a theatrical and tourist Mecca.\n\nBing Crosby served as an honorary director of the festival from 1949 to 1951. Charles Laughton visited in 1961, saying \"I have just seen the four best productions of Shakespeare that I have ever seen in my life.\" Laughton begged to play King Lear, but died in 1962 before he could fulfill the dream. Stacy Keach was a cast member in 1962 and 1963. Duke Ellington and his orchestra presented a benefit concert in 1966 that brought many luminaries to Ashland.\n\n1952 saw the birth of the tradition of closing the outdoor season with a ceremony in which many of company members enter the darkened theater carrying candles and a company member selected for the honor speaks Prospero's words from Act IV Scene I of the Tempest beginning, \"Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air, into thin air…\" On completion of the speech all extinguish the flames and file silently out of the theatre.\n\nThe tradition of opening the outdoor season with a Feast of Will (initially the Feasting of the Tribe of Will) was initiated in 1956 in Lithia Park with Miss Oregon and then state senator Mark Hatfield attending.\n\nThe City of Portland approached OSF in the late 1970s about joining the art scene there, leading to the building of a new center in Portland. In 1986, OSF was again approached about producing in the new Portland Center for the Performing Arts, leading to the launch in November 1988 of a season of five plays including Shaw's \"Heartbreak House\" and Shakespeare's \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\", the first of four productions that transferred to or from Ashland. At the invitation of the City of Portland, OSF established a resident theatre in the Portland Center for the Performing Arts in 1988 that spun off to independence in 1994 as Portland Center Stage. Those six seasons ran from November–April, allowing many company members to work in both cities. In 1990-1991 Portland imported rotating repertory from OSF, a company of 10 actors performing 43 roles.\n\nIn 1986, the Festival received the President's Volunteer Action Award; in 1987 it initiated Daedalus, a fundraiser to help victims of HIV/AIDS that has continued annually ever since.\nA second theatre, the indoor Angus Bowmer Theatre (see below), opened in 1970, enabling OSF to expand its season into the spring and fall; within a year, attendance tripled to 150,000. Angus L. Bowmerretired in 1971, and leadership of the Festival passed to Jerry Turner, a respected actor/director and later a translator of Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, who served as artistic director until 1991. He widened the Festival repertory to production of classics by the likes of Molière, Ibsen, and Chekhov. By 1976, the festival was filling 99% of its seats while offering some 275 performances of eight plays each season. In 1977, the Festival opened a third theatre, dubbed the Black Swan (see below), in what originally was an auto dealership, and attendance reached 300,000. By 1979, the year that Bowmer died, the Festival was producing 11 plays a season, the number that has been standard ever since. In 1983 OSF won both its first Tony Award for outstanding achievement in regional theatre and the National Governors' Association Award for distinguished service to the arts, the first ever to a performing arts organization.\n\nThe Oregon Shakespearean Festival was renamed the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 1988. Turner retired in 1991 and actor/director Henry Woronicz took control from 1991 to 1996. When Woronicz left in 1996, OSF recruited Libby Appel from the highly respected Indiana Repertory Theatre, and a guest director at OSF from 1988 to 1991. She served as Artistic Director from 1996 through 2007. In 1997, the OSF-commissioned \"The Magic Fire\" was presented at the John F. Kennedy Center and named by \"Time\" among the year's best plays. In 2002, the Thomas Theatre (see below) replaced the Black Swan as the venue for small, experimental productions in a Black box theatre. In 2003, \"Time\" named OSF as the second best regional theatre in the United States (Chicago's Goodman Theater was first).\n\nCurrent Artistic Director Bill Rauch succeeded Appel in 2008. Rauch was the co-founder and artistic director of the Cornerstone Theater Company in Los Angeles and had been a guest director at OSF for six seasons prior to his appointment. His vision includes making direct connections between classic plays and contemporary concerns, incorporating musicals into the annual selection of plays, exploring beyond the Western canon to incorporate Asian and African epics into the Festival, and reaching out to youth. While continuing to work with established playwrights, he has commissioned works by new ones, and has initiated the Black Swan Lab to develop new works for the stage. Each year, ten OSF actors are assigned to the Lab to work with Bill Rauch, OSF Dramaturg Lue Douthit, and Producer Sarah Rasmusen as one of their regular repertory assignments. In recognition of his work, he received the Margo Jones Award for his impact on American theatre in 2009 and the 2018 Ivy Behune Award from Actors Equity.\n\nInspired by Shakespeare's canon of plays, Rauch initiated a 10-year program to commission of up to 37 new plays collectively called \"American Revolutions: the United States History Cycle\". Under the direction of Alison Carey, the plays look at moments of change in America's past. Grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Collins Foundation, the Edgerton Foundation, the Harold and Mimi Steinberg Trust, and the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation support American Revolutions. Through December 2016, 32 plays have been commissioned and ten of these have reached the stage, beginning with \"American Night: The Ballad of Juan Jose\" (2010). It was followed by \"Ghost Light\" (2011); \"The March\" (2011 at Steppenwolf Theatre Company); \"Party People\" and \"All the Way\" (2012); \"The Liquid Plain\" (2013); the sequel to \"All the Way\", \"The Great Society\" (2014, commissioned by and co-produced with Seattle Repertory Theatre), \"Sweat\" (2015), \"Indecent\" (2015 at Yale Repertory Theatre and La Jolla Playhouse; 2016 at Vineyard Theatre; 2017 on Broadway), and \"Roe\" (co-produced with Arena Stage and Berkeley Repertory Theatre).\n\nThrough December 2014, \"All the Way\" has received seven awards including co-winner of the inaugural 2013 Edward M. Kennedy Prize for Drama Inspired by American History; the 2014 Tony Award for Best Play, the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play, the Drama League Award for Outstanding Production of a Broadway Play, the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding New Play, the Elliott Norton Award for Outstanding Production by a Large Resident Theatre, and the IRNE Award for Best New Play, Large Theater. In addition, the 2014 Tony Award for best actor went to Bryan Cranston for his portrayal of Lyndon Johnson in the Broadway production of \"All the Way\". Partnerships with Arena Stage, Berkeley Repertory Theatre, Center Stage, Company One, Guthrie Theater, Penumbra Theatre Company Playwrights Center, The Public Theater, Seattle Repertory Theatre and Steppenwolf Theatre Company ensure that the plays will reach beyond their original OSF audience. Time (insert reference to 6 December 2017 issue) magazine named Lynn Nottage's Sweat and Paula Vogel's Indecent #1 and #3, respectively, to their list of the \"Top 10 Plays and Musicals of 2017\", both originating as part of the American Revolutions project at OSF.\n\nIn February 2018, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival announced that Rauch would be leaving after completing the 2019 season to become artistic director of the new Perelman Center at the World Trade Center in New York.\nColumbia University Professor John McWhorter has pointed out that Shakespeare's language is no longer entirely ours. Granted, he says, with the help of notes and time to study them, you can work out the sense of some of the obscure dialogue, but not in a theatre in a matter of seconds while the action speeds by and the actors deliver the lines with all the urgency of the moment then move on. Its time, goes the argument of many scholars, for versions that will do for a contemporary English-speaking public what has been done for much of the world where Shakespeare is performed in the native language of the audience—make every word intelligible.\n\nPlay on! is an OSF project being carried out by 36 playwrights paired with dramaturgs working in concert with 17 different theatres and academic institutions commissioned to translate all 39 plays attributed to Shakespeare into contemporary modern English by 31 December 2018. Each playwright is asked to respect the language, meter, rhythm, metaphor, image, rhyme, rhetoric, and emotional content of the original. The goal is 39 unique side-by-side companion translations that are both performable and useful reference texts for classrooms and productions.\n\nWhile each playwright will take his or her own approach, Kenneth Cavander, the playwright who undertook and completed this task for \"Timon of Athens\" felt that the trick was to leave what is immediate and alive to our ears in the original untouched and only elsewhere to unpack whatever might hinder the free flow of the story in a way that is clear, not over-reverent, and above all, actable, so that the result is clear and compelling to a contemporary audience while preserving the spirit of the original.\n\nIn 2013, 108,388 individuals bought 407,787 tickets, seeing an average of 3.76 plays each. Of these, 92,234 people were visitors to the area spending $54,534,565 beyond the price of their theater tickets. Added to the $32,233,543 in actual Festival expenditures, the direct contribution to the local economy in 2013 was $86,768,108. In 2015, 103,946 individuals bought 390,380 tickets, seeing an average of 3.3 plays each. Of these, 88,784 people were visitors to the area spending $55,332,927 beyond the price of their theater tickets. Added to the $35,182,783 in actual Festival expenditures, the direct contribution to the local economy in 2015 was $90,515,710. The estimated total contribution based on the multiplier effect brought total impact to $251,627,515 in 2013 and to $262,495,558 in 2014. The multiplier effect measures how often each dollar received is spent partly on further local goods and services. For OSF, 2.9 is the estimated multiplier.\n\nAttendance in 2014 at 794 performances of eleven plays was 398,289, 88% of capacity. Attendance in 2015 at 786 performances of eleven plays was 390,387, 87% of capacity. In 2017, overall attendance at 795 performances was 381,378, 82% of capacity, generating $21.9 million in ticket sales. The difference was accounted for by the eight fewer scheduled performances, variations in seating configurations, cancellation of five outdoor performances in 2015 and of nine outdoor performances in 2017 due to smoke from forest fires.\n\nThe Oregon Shakespeare Festival is an active community citizen. It participates each year in Ashland's Martin Luther King celebration, Juneteenth celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation, and Fourth of July Parade. The Green Show (see above) and Hip-Hop Poetry Open Mic are free. The Daedalus Project is an annual fund-raising event managed by company members since 1988 in support of HIV/AIDS charitable organizations. It features a morning fun run, an afternoon play reading, an \"arts and treasures\" sale and an evening variety show and underwear parade.\n\nIn 2016, the Festival hosted the fifth biennial national Asian American Theater Conference and Festival. In addition to a full slate of conference sessions during the week, the event included six original plays, five play readings, and three Green Shows (see above). Participants also had an opportunity to see several regular Festival performances, two of which had an Asian setting and one an Asian-American theme.\n\nThe Oregon Shakespeare Festival occupies a campus adjacent to Lithia Park and the Plaza in Ashland, Oregon. The primary buildings are the three theatres, Carpenter Hall, and the Camps, Pioneer, and Administration buildings, all surrounding an open central court, locally known as \"The Bricks\" that ties everything together into an architecturally coherent whole and facilitates movement. It also provides a stage for the nightly Green Shows (see above) from June through September. Other facilities include the Black Swan, which serves as a laboratory for the development of new plays, the production facility, the costume shop, classrooms, and the Hay Patton Rehearsal Center. Other buildings are off campus.\nThe Allen Elizabethan Theatre has evolved since the founding of the Shakespeare Festival when the first performance of \"Twelfth Night\" was presented on July 2, 1935.\n\nThe design for the first outdoor OSF Elizabethan Theatre was sketched by Angus L. Bowmer based on his recollection of productions at the University of Washington in which he had acted as a student. Ashland, Oregon obtained WPA funds in 1935 to build it within the high circular walls that remained in the roofless shell of the abandoned Chautauqua theatre. Bowmer extended the walls to reduce the stage width to fifty-five feet, and painted the extensions to resemble half-timbered buildings. He designed a thrust stage—one projecting toward the audience—with a balcony. Two columns helped divide the main stage into forestage, middle stage, and inner stage areas. Illustrating the improvised nature of it all, actors doubled as stage hands, stage lighting was housed in coffee cans, and string beans were planted along the walls to improve sound quality! Fifty cent general admission seating was on benches just behind the one-dollar reserved seating on folding chairs. This theatre was torn down during World War II.\n\nThe second outdoor Elizabethan Theatre was built in 1947 from plans drawn up by University of Washington drama professor John Conway. The main stage became trapezoidal, with entries added on either side, and windows added above them flanking the balcony stage. A low railing gave a finished appearance to the forestage. Chairs arranged to improve sight lines replaced bench seating. Backstage areas were added gradually and haphazardly, until the ramshackle result was ordered torn down as a fire hazard in 1958.\n\nThe next year saw the opening of the current outdoor theatre, whose name was changed from Elizabethan to Allen Elizabethan Theatre in October, 2013. Patterned on London's 1599 Fortune Theatre and designed by Richard L. Hay, it incorporated all the stage dimensions mentioned in the Fortune contract. The trapezoidal stage was retained but the façade was extended to three stories, resulting in a forestage, middle stage, inner below, inner above (the old balcony), and a musicians' gallery. The wings were provided with second-story windows. Each provides acting areas, creating many staging possibilities. A pitched, shingled roof enhances the half-timbered façade. A windowed gable was extended from the center of the roof to cover and define the middle stage. Just before each performance, an actor opens the gable window, and in keeping with Elizabethan tradition signaling a play in progress, runs a flag up the pole to the sound of a trumpet and doffs his cap to the audience.\n\nThe result is an approximate replica of the Fortune Theatre. The known but incomplete dimensions apply only to the stage. The original specifications sometimes say no more than \"to be built like the Globe,\" for which there are no plans or details. The remotely operated lighting, on scaffolding on either side of the stage, of course did not exist in the original and the current site rather than the original architecture determines the shape of the auditorium. Twelve hundred seats in slightly offset arcs ascend the original hillside, giving an excellent view of the stage from each seat. The old Chautauqua theatre walls, now ivy-covered, remain as the outer perimeter of the theatre.\n\nThe $7.6 million Paul Allen Pavilion was added in 1992. It houses a control room, and audience services including infrared hearing devices, blankets, pillows and food and drink, which are allowed in the auditorium. Several hundred seats were moved to a balcony and two boxes, further improving sightlines and acoustics. Vomitoria (colloquially \"voms\"), the traditional name for entryways for actors from under the seating area, were added and the lighting scaffolds were eliminated.\n\nEach year, three plays are offered in rotation Tuesdays through Sundays in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre from late June to early October.\n\nAn April 1968 report by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research of the University of Oregon pointed to the lost opportunity represented by turning away thousands of people by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival each year. It further noted that the Festival had become an important economic engine for southern Oregon, and recommended addition of an indoor theatre. This led the City of Ashland to apply to the Economic Development Administration of the Department of Commerce in Fall 1968 for a $1,792,000 project grant with the Angus Bowmer Theatre as the keystone. The plan also called for a parking building, a remodeled administration building and box office, a scene shop and exhibit hall that later would become the OSF Black Swan, landscaping, and street realignment. $896,000 was approved in April 1969, to match an equal amount to be raised through private donations. The fund drive quickly exceeded its goal and ground for the new theatre was broken on December 18, 1969.\n\nThe theatre was ready just five months later and opened with a production of \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\" selected to recognize the Shakespearean origin of the Festival but to signal that the Festical also was ready to broaden its horizons by incorporating modern plays into its repertoire. Reinforcing that signal, \"The Fantasticks\" and \"You Can't Take it with You\" were also presented during that first six-week season.\n\nThe Angus Bowmer Theatre seats between 592 and 610 patrons depending on configuration. Although about half the size of the outdoor theatre, it more than doubled audience capacity by making it possible to hold matinee performances and to extend the season into spring and fall.\n\nThe design by Richard L. Hay with architects Kirk, Wallace and McKinley of Seattle and contractor Robert D. Morrow, Inc., Salem, Oregon was at once basic, flexible, functional and innovative. All seats are within of the stage, arranged with only two side aisles and wide spaces between rows. Dark colors resist reflection and draw the eye to the stage. The forestage is on a hydraulic lift system that can emulate the thrust stage of the OSF Allen Elizabethan Theatre, form a more conventional proscenium front, move below auditorium floor level to form an orchestra pit, or drop two stories for storage of equipment or scenery. The walls of the auditorium can swing in to close down the playing area or open to accommodate larger productions.\nIllustrating these characteristics, the first picture is the set for August Wilson's \"Fences\". The second, taken two hours later, is the set for the ancient Hindu classic \"The Clay Cart\". Stage crews for the two indoor theatres must complete set changes of this scope six days a week between the end of a matinee and the \"call\" before the evening curtain (the outdoor stage changes daily). This illustrates the nature of true repertory theater, which allows the playgoer to see different plays on the same day on the same stage, but requires designing and making sets to withstand constant rapid assembly, disassembly and return to accessible storage to await the next change of set.\n\nIn what then Executive Director Paul Nicholson called the biggest crisis in the history of the Festival, a crack was discovered in the seventy-foot long, six and one-half foot high main ceiling support beam of the Bowmer Theatre two hours before the 18 June 2011 matinee. Shows were immediately relocated to other venues as work progressed to repair the beam. A 598-seat tent, \"Bowmer in the Park\", was erected as a temporary replacement venue. A single set was designed and built to serve four very different shows, and the shows themselves were re-staged while keeping the artistic vision of each as intact as possible. Thirty-one performances were given in the tent and averaged 82% of capacity generating approximately $650,000 in revenue against approximately $800,000 for the tent itself, $1,000,000 in lost revenue from ticket returns, and $330,000 in repair costs. The Bowmer reopened on 2 August, a month ahead of the initial estimate. The Festival filed an insurance claim for $3.58 million and received checks in March 2012 for $330,000 to cover the cost of repairs and $2.984 million covering much of the lost revenue, leaving about $200,000, primarily representing the cost of the temporary tent theater itself, unresolved.\n\nThe Black Swan (G on the OSF campus map above) served as the Festival's third theatre from 1977 to 2001. The building, originally an automobile dealership, was bought in 1969 as a scene shop and rehearsal hall. Company members began using it to stage \"midnight\" readings for one another. They invited friends who brought other friends. Artistic Director Jerry Turner recognized the opportunity to take risks with unconventional staging and subjects, and called for its development as a third OSF theatre. Fitting a theatre into the existing building was challenging. It could hold only 138 seats, all within five rows of the stage. There had to be, as designer Richard Hay put it, a \"certain amount of tucking and squeezing.\" Each director had to solve the problem of an immovable roof support in the middle of the stage. For instance, in one production, it became a crucifixion after a horizontal piece added, . The theatre reverted to its earlier roles in 2002 when it was replaced by the New Theater, now renamed the Thomas Theatre. Among those roles are rehearsal space, meeting and audition rooms, classes, and since 2011 as a home for the Black Swan Lab (see above).\n\nThe limitations stemming from adapting an existing building as the Black Swan led to the design and building of a third theatre that provided flexible seating and increased capacity while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan. Opened in March 2002 and originally named the New Theatre, it was renamed the Thomas Theatre in 2013 as a result of a generous $4.5 million gift from a group of donors. The name is in recognition of long-time OSF development director Peter Thomas who died in March 2010. The Thomas Theatre expands the possibilities for experiment and innovation while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan, no seat being more than six rows from the stage. Richard L. Hay designed the theatre space. Architects Thomas Hacker and Associates of Portland designed the building. The contractor was Emerick Construction, and acoustical engineering was provided by Dohn and Associates. The seats can be arranged in three configurations. In arena mode, a stage of is surrounded on all four sides by 360 seats. In three-quarter thrust mode, a stage is surrounded on three sides by 270 seats, and in avenue mode, a stage provides 228 seats on two sides. There is a trap room under the stage and a fly loft at one end. A computer controls 300 circuits and over 400 lights of various types. The remainder of the building is given over to downstairs and upstairs lobbies, concessions, access distribution, archives (see below), storage, laundry room, green room, quiet room, warm-up room, dressing space for 18 actors, showers/restrooms, costume and wig rooms, stage manager's office, maintenance space, and storage for props and set pieces.\n\nThe Box Office (J on the OSF campus map above) is on the same courtyard as the Thomas Theatre. The Festival acquired the Administration Building (C) in April 1967. Forming the northern boundary of the campus, the building houses the Group Sales Office (D), artistic, business, communication, education, human resources, development, community productions, mailroom, and an annex to the costume shop. The Festival Welcome Center (E), on the northern side of the building facing Main Street, offers information about OSF and Ashland, houses a small rotating exhibit of costumes from past shows, and adjoins the Margery Bailey Room, otherwise known as the Education Center. The adjacent Camps Building (A) houses the members' lounge, marketing offices, and a meeting room.\n\nJust off the courtyard, the Pioneer Building houses the Festival's costume shop. The staff of over 60 creates the costumes and accessories in three main studios on the lower floor of the building and in an extension of the Administration Building. Also in this area are offices and fitting rooms for the costume designers and costume design assistants, a costume props area and a vented paint room. Upstairs is a dye room, lounge, laundry, storage room, and office. During the height of costume production each season, a wig shop and additional studio is open in the basement of the Angus Bowmer Theatre.\n\nThe Festival acquired Carpenter Hall (I) in October 1973, renovating it to accommodate lectures, concerts, rehearsals, meetings and Festival and community events. The Bill Patton Garden (K) provides the venue for free informal summer noon talks by OSF actors and staff. The Tudor Guild, a separate non-profit corporation, operates the Tudor Guild Gift Shop (B) and Brass Rubbing Center (K) where visitors can make rubbings of facsimiles of 55 historic English brasses under expert guidance. Just off campus, a purpose-equipped fitness center is staffed by two professional trainers who help prepare actors for physically demanding roles that often require acrobatics, fights, and pratfalls and monitored during additional open hours by a volunteer.\n\nThe Festival completed a $7.2 million purpose-built production facility in neighboring Talent, Oregon, in November 2013 that is home to a multi-function staff of 40. The building houses custom-designed technologically advanced set and prop construction and scene painting facilities. The scene shop has an extensive pit area that precisely duplicates the trap doors in the theaters themselves, allowing for precise sizing, testing of assembly and disassembly, and automating elevator cues. Lighting in the painting areas duplicates that in the theaters, guaranteeing desired colors. The building also houses OSF's costume rental business, which has over 50,000 costumes and over 15,000 costume props such as armor, crowns, and wigs available for rent by other theaters, television and movie producers, and corporations.\n\nWith the removal of the scene construction shop in 2014 from its location in a building a block from the Festival campus to the new Production Building (see above), a thirteen-month transformation began of the building into the Hay-Patton Rehearsal Center by demolishing everything except the masonry exterior and the steel framework and raising the second floor three feet. Following a plan developed by Ogden Roemer Wilkerson Architecture carried out by Adroit Construction at a cost of $4.4 million, it hosted its first rehearsal on 29 December 2015. The building is equipped with a sophisticated sound system and has six rehearsal halls, three of them some , sufficient precisely duplicate any of the three Festival theatres, and one which matches the Thomas Theatre stage. All six include fully sprung floors to protect actors' joints when dancing, rehearsing stage combat, or similar physical activities. The LED lighting system is zoned and dimmable, the ceilings have steel tracks which allow for suspension of scenery, lights, loudspeakers and even people. Some have special features such as small conversation areas and dance-style mirrors. Other features include a stage management office, a recording studio, a movement studio focused on the Feldenkrais Method, a voice studio for work on vocal technique, stamina, and dialect; a loading dock, a conference room, showers, two warmup spaces that double as small meeting rooms, two green rooms equipped with refrigerator, storage cases, sink, dishwasher, and tables (custom-made by the prop shop) and chairs.\n\nOSF is a non-profit corporation managed under US and Oregon law by a 32-member Board of Directors nominated and elected for eight-year terms. The endowment has a net worth in excess of $30 million that returns about $1.2 million to support the annual operating budget. It is managed by seven trustees who are selected for five-year terms by the Board of Directors.\n\nOSF is supported in part by corporate and individual donors through direct support of individual plays and annual non-voting memberships. These are offered at nine levels, each with its own privileges beginning with basic memberships for $75 which includes access to the member's lounge and a 10% discount in the Tudor Guild shop. Some 750 who contribute $1250-$2999 a year are designated Producer members, enjoying beyond all the benefits of the previous category, two complimentary tickets to plays, twice weekly coffees during which a cast member is interviewed, and three events each including three discussions on aspects of the year's productions and a dinner (at additional cost) with the actors. Additional benefits accrue to 175 Producer's Circle members who contribute $3000-$5999 in a year, to upward of 80 Chautauqua Guild and Chautauqua members who contribute $6000-$24,999, while those contributing $25,000 or more annually join the Artistic Director's Circle at one of four levels.\n\nNearly 400 (many of whom also are annual members) who have supported the Festival through planned gifts are members of the Southampton Society, named for the Earl of Southampton who was Shakespeare's great patron. They are invited to one three-day event each season similar to the three for Producer members described above. Finally, some 150 people join the Bowmer Society annually providing partial support of the educational efforts of the Festival, described below.\n\nThe OSF professional staff is organized into administrative, artistic, education, and production sections.\n\nThe administrative staff of approximately 125 is supervised by Executive Director Cynthia Rider (2013-) who follows Paul Nicholson (1995-2012) and William Patton (1955-1995). The Director of Finance and Administration supervises the physical plant (custodial services, maintenance, and security), accounting, mail room, and receptionists. The Director of Marketing and Communication supervises the box office, membership services, archives (see below), publications and media, marketing, and audience services, which itself includes house managers, ushers, concessions, and access staff for handicapped patrons (see below). The Director of Development supervises institutional giving and major gifts. The Director of ITS manages information technology. The Director of Human Resources manages employees, volunteer and events programs (see below), safety, and a professional development program called FAIR (Fellowships, Assistantships, Internships, and Residencies) that provides students aspiring to a career in theater with direct experience of best practices across all aspects of professional theatre. Fellows work directly with senior management while expanding their personal networks. Three residencies varying from four to eleven months are exclusive to the Dramaturgy and Literary Management Department. Twenty-five to thirty Assistantships annually provide hands-on opportunities in virtually every area of the organization by pairing recipients with an appropriate OSF staff member for an average of three months. Finally, 15-20 unpaid Internships of two to four months annually provide emerging artists and administrators with hands-on experience by pairing them with a Festival staff member in the assistant's area of interest. Internships may fulfill academic requirements determined by recipient's home academic institution.\n\nArtistic Director Bill Rauch (see above) leads a staff consisting of approximately 450. The Artistic Director selects the plays and directors for each season, and chooses the actors, who number between 90 and 120, and the musicians and dancers who number approximately 25. The Associate Artistic Director, in turn, supervises scenic, lighting, and costume design, Fight Director and the dramaturgs.\n\nA Voice and Text Director is assigned to every play from pre-production through the opening performance. OSF employs two full-time voice and text directors and one or two guest artists each year to meet the demand for these specialists. They help the actors and directors craft vocal choices that will be theatrically effective and sustainable through the run of the show. This can involve work on posture, breath support, resonant placement, muscularity of articulation and screaming technique. They also work with the actors on the text of the play, often in one-on-one sessions. This can include examination of meter, rhythm, sound patterning such as alliteration and rhyme, imagery, and rhetorical structure and devices such as antithesis and repetition. When required, they coach the actors in accents and dialects based on samples of native speakers and work with each actor to find a sound that is as authentic as possible to the character's background but also intelligible in a contemporary theatrical context and conducive to that individual's acting process.\n\nOnce the plays have opened, the resident voice and text staff is on hand to help actors with vocal challenges that may arise, attend periodic performances to give maintenance notes, work with understudies, teach voluntary voice classes to the acting company, provide ongoing professional development support in the form of project or individual session work, and participate in play selection and workshops for upcoming seasons.\n\nThe production staff of approximately 125 is responsible for costumes, lighting, properties, scenery, sound, and stage operations. Costumes are produced by a staff of about 60 (artisans, cutters, designers, dyers, first hands, hair and wig specialists, stitchers, technicians, and wardrobe managers). Scenery is built by a staff of technicians, carpenters, a welder, an engineer and a buyer and moved by a crew of 24 stagehands; lighting staff number eight, and sound and properties each are managed by staffs of six each. A production stage manager, eight stage managers and three production managers ensure the smooth operation of the three theatres and a deck manager coordinates the Green Show.\n\nReflecting the profession of Festival founder Angus Bowmer, a professor of English at the then Southern Oregon Normal School (now Southern Oregon University), education has played an important role at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival from its inception. Under the direction of Joan Langley, the full-time education staff of nine includes the director, both in-residence and outreach program managers and coordinators, a curriculum specialist, and resident teaching artists. The goal is to inspire a lifelong relationship to theater and the works of Shakespeare by offering educational experiences that support each season's plays to a diverse range of students, teachers, and audiences.\n\nThus, the Festival provides a broad range of educational programs for a wide range of ages and interests. The initial focus was on college students and the Institute for Renaissance Studies was formed to meet their needs. The Festival offered short courses, lectures, readings, concerts, and exhibits focused on the plays of the season. Participation was open to all Festival company members and audiences, either for college credit from several universities, or for audit. Coursework was supported by a collection of Renaissance and late-medieval books, manuscripts, and prints now housed in the Southern Oregon University's Hannon Library.\n\nPrograms specifically for teachers include the weekend \"Inside Shakespeare\" and the five-day retreat, \"Shakespeare in the Classroom\" that emphasizes innovative and pedagogical methods to help teachers make the works of Shakespeare involving and accessible to contemporary students.\n\nThe completion of the indoor Angus Bowmer Theatre in 1971 and the subsequent expansion of the Festival season into the school year enabled an increasing variety of educational programs for middle and high school students. Students visiting the Festival itself are the recipients of some 55,000 discounted tickets each year. Some 900 workshops offered each year by OSF actor-teachers enhance the educational value of their visits. The Bowmer Project for Student Playgoers (initiated in 1996) prepares local teachers to teach plays and includes tickets to a performance, a back-stage tour, and a post-show discussion with one of the actors. Each year since 1981, OSF has offered residential Summer Seminars for High School Juniors that enroll 65 students in a two-week program during which they see several plays and learn about on-stage technique and theatre management.\n\nFor those unable to come to the Festival, six pairs of actors participate in the School Visit Program, initiated in 1971, which now reaches some 60,000 students primarily in four states although it has made occasional visits to eight others. Each one-day visit includes two 50-minute performances and one two-hour or two one-hour workshops. Performances are a condensed version of one Shakespeare play, selected scenes from Shakespeare illustrating a single theme, or a combination of Shakespeare and other literature selected to meet the needs of the school being visited.\n\nPrograms of different lengths and formality to meet the needs and interests of adults include Wake Up With Shakespeare, Shakespeare Comprehensive, Festival Noons, Prefaces, Prologues, Park Talks, Road Scholars, and \"Unfolding Seminars.\" \n\nFinally, OSF's Development Department offers educational opportunities through its tours offered in late Fall, often on cruise ships such as Queen Mary 2. Past tours have included two to England focused on Shakespeare, one to Greece and Turkey focused on the beginnings and history of theater, and one along the coasts of France and Spain and to the Canary Islands. These tours feature an intensive schedule of lectures and interactive workshops with four to eight OSF staff and actors, as well as visits to local attractions.\n\nThe OSF website contains information on current educational programming.\n\nAudience Services offers a full range of programs and services for patrons with disabilities. For blind and visually impaired patrons, the Festival has six professional audio describers on staff who provide live audio description for every performance of every play with two weeks advance notice. Braille and large print playbills are available for all productions. Service animals are always welcome. For deaf and hearing-impaired patrons, six American Sign Language interpreted performances with highly trained interpreters are offered each season. Complimentary infrared listening devices and Telecoil hearing aid loops are available in all three of the Festival's theatres, and patrons may communicate with the Festival through the Oregon Telecommunications Relay Service. There is accessible seating in all performance venues, nearby accessible parking, and all of the above accommodations can be provided for the wide range of ancillary events that enrich the OSF experience, such as backstage tours, prefaces, prologues, and park talks. Each season a limited number of performances, post-show meet-and-greets, pre-show introductions, and backstage tours are open-captioned in Spanish.\n\nThe archivists develop, preserve, and maintain a comprehensive collection of documents and oral histories, drawings and photographs, audio and video recordings, and artifacts pertaining to the artistic and administrative history and heritage of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Collecting, organizing, and preserving these materials of what otherwise is an ephemeral art form to archival standards is an ongoing effort aided in part by a two-year grant from the National Historical Publications and Research Commission, with material added on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe archives are open Monday through Friday, 9AM to 5PM, and the staff invites any inquiry or reference question by phone or email. Researchers and the general public are welcome to visit the archives by appointment. Other collections are available for research, although some collections have restrictions, and permission must be obtained for their use.\n\nThe Archives include Education department records from 1947 on and document the department's programming and structural evolution. Print materials include annual reports, brochures, calendars, correspondence, course handouts, course readings, news clippings, newsletters, photographs, posters, scripts, statistics and survey reports, study guides, and teacher information kits, guides, and resource kits. Audio and video recordings include radio broadcasts and school visit program performances.\n\nIn May, 2013, the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the Festival a $200,000 grant to digitize 2649 deteriorating tapes, films and videos and to make them publicly available through its website and the YouTube platform. The collection spans the history of the Festival from its inception in 1935 through 2012 and comprises an unparalleled and comprehensive record of Shakespearean and theatrical performance by a single U.S. theatre company. Included are full-length recordings of 541 of the 570 Festival productions from 1950 to 2012, including three or more varied interpretations of every play in the Shakespearean canon with exemplary casts before live audiences and the ballad opera series. The production recordings are supplemented by 44 adaptations broadcast on NBC radio, more than 100 hours of artist interviews, Shakespeare lectures by nationally and internationally renowned scholars and educators, production music, promotional recordings, and recordings of significant events in the company's history. Also included are the home movies of founder Angus Bowmer, Southern Oregon Normal School events and rare footage of the initial 1935 Festival season!\n\nThe professional staff is augmented by volunteers—approximately 700 contributing about 32,000 hours each year. Tudor Guild volunteers staff the brass rubbing center, concession stands, and gift shop. Volunteers welcome visitors to the campus and answer their questions, staff the Green Show information table and welcome center, facilitate post-matinee discussions, provide concierge services for student groups, and supplement the professional ushers at all three theatres. Behind the scenes, volunteers help with office tasks such as preparing will-call tickets for pickup, sorting mail, filing, copying, mailings, and transcribing interviews. They work in the Archives, Costume Shop, Costume Warehouse, and Scene Shop, help with auditions, and serve as attendants in the company fitness facility. Among occasional tasks too numerous to provide a complete list, volunteers assist with access services and the periodic audience surveys, drive company vehicles, providing transportation for visiting dignitaries, and direct traffic during \"strike\" at the end of the season. Each year, company members present a thank you show titled \"Love's Labors\" for the volunteers.\n\nThe availability of small inexpensive computing platforms, LEDs, and compact powerful batteries allows special effects to be built into props, costumes, and scenery. Lighting, atmospherics, sounds, even motorized movement can be programmed into devices and controlled by the actors or remotely. WiFi and Bluetooth devices allow for wireless communication between the control console and the effect. For example, the LEDs built into a dress can be remotely illuminated and colors changed live while on stage. Costumes in \"Head Over Heels\" (a musical by Lolita Snipes), \"The Wiz\", and \"The Winter's Tale\" are recent examples of wireless control. Lanterns, candles, fireflies, and other effects built into props and scenery also utilize embedded electronics.\n\nThe theatres feature Meyer speakers, Yamaha mixing consoles, Clear-Com Freespeak wireless communication, Sennheiser wireless microphone systems and Qlab software playback for their theater spaces. The Elizabethan Theater underwent a major audio system re-design with Meyer Sound Laboratories in 2014. The install included various types of Mina line arrays (UPQ-1Ps, UPQ-2Ps, MM4-Xps, 500 HPs, UPM-1Xps and UP-4Xps).\n\nAll playgoers are offered a complimentary \"Playbill\" with a synopsis of the plays, cast lists, and directors' statements. All members receive 3 editions of \"Prologue\" each season (one each for spring, summer, and fall). This magazine contains selected articles on directors, actors, costumes, props, and plays each season. Another publication that is made available at higher donor levels is \"Illuminations\", a comprehensive guide to each year's plays. \"Illuminations\" includes synopses, themes, information on playwrights and historical and other contextual information. Each year, the Festival publishes Teachers First! providing information on the season's plays including age suitability, the seasonal calendar, ordering and discount information.\n\nThe annual \"Souvenir Program.\" includes photographic highlights of each play and special articles along with pictures and biographies of actors, playwrights, and the many people who work behind the scenes. A chart emphasizing the repertory nature of OSF lists all the actors and their parts in the plays.\n\nThe Festival also publishes a \"Bard's Scorecard,\" which lists all of William Shakespeare's Plays, the years OSF produced them, and allows repeat patrons to cross off which plays they've seen towards completing the canon.\n\nOSF is a constituent of Theatre Communications Group, the national service organization for the not-for-profit theatre world, and a member of the Shakespeare Theatre Association of America. It operates under contracts with Actors' Equity Association, The Union of Professional Actors and Stage Managers in the United States, and the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society, Inc., an independent national labor union.\n\nThe following plays are scheduled for the 2018 season.\n\nPlays being presented in the Allen Elizabethan Theater (15 June through 14 October):\n\nPlays being presented in the Angus Bowmer Theatre (16 February to 27 October):\n\nPlays being presented in the Thomas Theatre (21 February to 28 October):\n\n"}

Probably Watteau's earliest painting, created roughly 1706-1710, it depicts a group of quite courtly peasants dancing among the trees.\n\nAmid the trees, a group of villagers play music while a couple dances. A toddler copies the lady's motions, entertaining the company. Rather than the usual contemporary association with debauchery, music here alludes to social harmony and order. The musicians glance coyly at the viewer, actors very aware of their spectators. This sort of interaction is one of Watteau's hallmarks.\n\nIt is an image of visual extremes: the dark forest background brings the peasants' bright clothing into sharp contrast. The rustic setting and the dancers' formal attire channel both the fête galante and a formal court celebration transplanted to a charming bit of countryside. \n\nThis is Watteau's earliest known painting, but already he had developed his own style. Painted shortly after he moved from Valenciennes to Paris, Watteau took the merry rustic scenes favored by his Flemish antecedents like Pieter Bruegel and Peter Paul Rubens, but gave them unprecedented grace, nobility, and style. Though painting a standard northern European subject, he drew heavily on Venetian landscapes, particularly in the atmospheric effects. It is, in effect, a declaration in favor of the Rococo movement with which Watteau would become so heavily associated. \n\n\"The Country Dance\" was acquired by the IMA in 1974, a gift of Mrs. Herman C. Krannert. It hangs in the Charles O. McGaughey Gallery and has the accession number 74.98.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11199842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11199842", "title": "Umbrella title", "text": "Umbrella title\n\nAn umbrella title is a formal or informal name connecting a number of individual items with a common theme. It is most often used in lieu of listing separately the separate components or providing a convenient \"label\" for a collection of disciplines.\n\nNonspecific fields of study are identified by umbrella titles such as \"physics\", \"physical education\", and \"medicine\", to distinguish them from specialized fields of study such as exercise physiology.\n\nMany scientific and academic conferences use umbrella titles as unifying themes for the activities scheduled in the course of the conference.\n\nUmbrella titles in common use involve either general job descriptions of a group of workers with similar responsibilities (like \"teacher\") or rank (military or nonmilitary).\n\nCollections of organizations with a common legal or legislative interest are often \"united\" under an umbrella title for the purposes of lobbying or participating in a lawsuit.\n\nUmbrella titles are widely used in music, literature, television, and theater. Uses of umbrella titles vary widely in the arts, to a much greater spectrum of use than in other fields of study.\n\nUmbrella titles are used to demarcate the music field into general trends or styles: classical music, jazz, rock music, hip hop, rhythm and blues and other labels which each cover more specialized musical styles. A similar \"structure\" can be found in the field of dance.\n\nPrior to the sale of the long playing record in 1950, albums containing several 78 revolutions-per-minute records were often sold under umbrella titles (a collection of recordings from \"Oklahoma\", for example). It can be argued that titles of all long-playing records and compact discs are \"umbrella\" titles—and several such recordings with a common theme often have an umbrella title (such as Chip Davis' \"Day Parts\" series) as well.\n\nWhile it can be argued that every title of a televised series, especially those primarily used to designate a time period rather than actual programming (like \"NBC Monday Night at the Movies\") is an umbrella, the term is more appropriately applied to names of anthology series, series that combine together to provide a common theme (such as the three components of \"90 Bristol Court\"), wheel series, and other series under a common heading (such as \"Crimetime After Primetime\" and \"Four in One\").\n\nWhile it was common practice in the 1950s and early 1960s for series to alternate or otherwise share a time slot in American broadcast network television (for example, \"The Jack Benny Show\" shared a time slot with, first \"Private Secretary\" and then \"The George Gobel Show\"), umbrella titles were not used by United States' networks until 1964, when NBC presented three half-hour programs on Monday nights as a programming block centered at a southern California apartment complex, \"90 Bristol Court\".\n\nWhile the 1964 programming experiment did not succeed (two of the series were cancelled; the third lasted the broadcast season but was not renewed for the 1965-1966 season), NBC was not dissuaded from further programming experimentation. Within a decade, the network then experimented with wheel series, first with \"Four in One\" and \"The Bold Ones\", then with \"NBC Mystery Movie\". Afterwards additional wheel series were presented by American broadcast networks, to varying degrees of success. The expirement was revived in 1979 with \"Cliffhangers\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, umbrella titles were used in varying degrees in their programming as well. The long-running \"Doctor Who\" used umbrella titles on several levels, first with individual named episodes under the umbrella of the title of an overall story (the first four episodes were commonly called \"An Unearthly Child\" even though none of them actually showed it to be the title of the story); even after the naming of individual episodes ceased, umbrella titles were often used to collect stories with a common enemy or theme (Daleks stories, Cybermen stories, UNIT stories, and season-long \"Key to Time\" and \"Trial of a Time Lord\").\n\nThe use of umbrella titles in motion pictures parallels their use in literature. Movie trilogies such as \"Lord of the Rings\" and the \"Three Colors\" trilogy (\"a.k.a.\" \"Red, White, and Blue trilogy\") commonly are called by umbrella titles, as was the case for their literary cousins (such as John Dos Passos' \"U.S.A.\"). Umbrella titles were often used to cover longer sequences of motion pictures or novels (such as the James Bond and \"Star Wars\" films and Marcel Proust's multi-volume \"Remembrance of Things Past\"). Often umbrella titles are used to collect motion pictures with common stars (\"Marx Brothers movies\") or common characters (\"Dirty Harry movies\"), as is the case for novels or comics (\"Perry Mason novels\", for example). In literature, sometimes an umbrella title is used for a collection of stories with a common locality, such as the Wessex novels of Thomas Hardy.\n"}
{"id": "15631779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15631779", "title": "Usher (occupation)", "text": "Usher (occupation)\n\nAn usher is a person who shows people where to sit, especially at a theatre or when attending a wedding. An example of an usher is a person who is friends with the groom who directs people where to sit as they enter the church for a wedding.\n\nThe word comes from the Latin \"ostiarius\" (\"porter\", \"doorman\") through Norman French, and is a cognate of the French \"\". \n\nUshers were servants or courtiers who showed or ushered visitors in and out of meetings in large houses or palaces.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a variety of titles for courtiers in the Royal Household include the word \"usher\". In England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, from the early sixteenth century until at least the end of the nineteenth century, the term denoted an assistant to a schoolmaster or head-teacher; an under-master, assistant-master. In such use, however, the term is now rare.\n\nUshers assist visitors by formally showing the way in a large building or to their appropriate seats. This may coincide with a security role.\n\nAt weddings, friends of the groom and bride may be recruited to direct guests at the ceremony, and generally be available for assistance.\n\nUshers help those in attendance at entertainment and sporting events in theatres and stadiums. Duties include checking tickets, directing people to their assigned seats, distributing programmes, answering questions and assisting people in finding restrooms and refreshments.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Labor, ushers, lobby attendants and ticket takers earn an average wage of $8.41 an hour and $17,500 a year. Approximately 102,000 are employed in this line of work. Most of these workers are employed by the motion picture and video industries, secondly they work in the performing arts and sporting events venues.\n\nOther jobs also come under the name 'Usher', such as baseball field personnel. A field usher coordinates not only the baseball diamond grounds but also the stadium itself.\n\nUshers are also expected to help with security and to ensure that only people with proper authority have access to backstage areas. Ushers also monitor the crowds and can summon security when needed.\n\nIn cinemas and theaters, it was common for ushers to check tickets and show people to their seats to watch the film being shown. If actually during the film, when lights were dimmed, the usher would shine a torch to light the row of seating in question.\n\n"}
{"id": "23838940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23838940", "title": "Walter Horn", "text": "Walter Horn\n\nWalter W. Horn (18 January 1908 – 26 December 1995) was a medievalist scholar noted for his work on the timber vernacular architecture of the Middle Ages. He was born in Germany, but fled Nazism and spent most of his academic career at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became the university system's first art historian and co-founded the History of Art department. A naturalized citizen of the United States, Horn served in the U.S. Army during World War II and then in the special intelligence unit that tracked down art works plundered by the Nazis. His most celebrated exploit was the recovery of the crown jewels of the Holy Roman Empire, also known as Charlemagne's Imperial Regalia. As a scholar, Horn is most noted for his work on the medieval architectural drawing known as the Plan of Saint Gall.\n\nHorn was born in the town of Waldangelloch in rural Baden. His mother was Matilde Peters; she married Karl Horn, a Lutheran minister. Walter attended a \"Gymnasium\" in nearby Heidelberg and went on to study art history at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Berlin. He earned his doctorate in 1934 at the University of Hamburg, studying under Erwin Panofsky. His dissertation, \"Die Fassade von Saint-Gilles\", on the façade of Saint-Gilles, Gard, was published in 1937.\n\nHorn fled Germany in opposition to the Nazi regime. He continued his studies from 1934 to 1937 as a research associate at the German Institute for the History of Art in Florence, Italy. In 1938, Horn moved to the United States and began his long association with the University of California, Berkeley, as a lecturer. A year later, he was given a permanent position as the first art historian in the University of California system. During this time, he married Ann Binkley Rand.\n\nHorn became a naturalized citizen in 1943. That same year, he volunteered for military duty in the U.S. Army. By 1945, he was a lieutenant in the Third Army under General George S. Patton. Horn's skills as a native speaker of German were put to use in interrogating prisoners of war. After the war, he continued as a special investigator in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, using his expertise as an art historian to track down art that had been stolen or concealed by the Nazis. Horn served until 1946, attaining the rank of captain.\n\nIn 1946, Horn succeeded in recovering the Imperial Regalia of Charlemagne, the crown, sceptre, and jewels of the Holy Roman Empire. These had been kept hidden by Germans who hoped to return to power even after their defeat by the Allies.\n\nReturning from the war, Horn married Alberta West Parker, a physician, who became a Clinical Professor of Public Health at UC Berkeley. In 1949, Horn and his family became embroiled in the controversy at his university over a loyalty oath requirement. During the era of the Cold War, the Red Scare, and McCarthyism, the Board of Regents at the University of California began to require that all university employees sign an oath affirming their loyalty to the state constitution and denying their membership or belief in organizations advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government. The requirement met with resistance, and in the summer of 1950 thirty-one professors who refused to sign were fired, despite their stature as \"internationally distinguished scholars.\" Horn's fellow medievalist Ernst Kantorowicz resigned rather than sign the oath, stating his reasons in two letters to the university president that were only published in English decades after the episode. Kantorowicz also presented a letter from Horn, who had signed the oath under protest. In the letter dated 23 August 1950, Horn, then acting chairman of the art department, pointed to his former military service and to his voluntary reactivation that same month as a reservist in the Armed Services.\n\nKantorowicz noted that Horn's letter \"illustrates the grave conflict of conscience and savage economic coercion to which, after fifteen months of pressure and struggle, he had finally to yield.\"\n\nHorn's early position as research associate in Florence gave him firsthand knowledge of the city's medieval church architecture and produced two important studies, \"Das Florentiner Baptisterium\" (1938), an analysis of the fabric and ornamentation of the Florence Baptistry that established new criteria for its dating, and \"Romanesque Churches in Florence: A Study of Their Chronology and Stylistic Development\" (1943), which included an examination of the masonry construction of San Miniato al Monte. Throughout his career, he continued to explore the conceptual connections between classical and northern architecture. His specialty was three-aisled timber structures in medieval churches, market halls and manor halls. He was known for arriving at a precise dating of medieval buildings through studying their technologies and observing the physical evidence, drawing on scientific disciplines; he dated timber structures with reference to radiocarbon analysis and dendrochronological tables.\n\nIn 1958, Horn published what is considered his most important article, \"On the Origins of the Medieval Bay System\" in the \"Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians\". He argued that bay-divided medieval churches derived from Germanic timber buildings and represented a continuous tradition of vernacular architecture in transalpine Europe. Horn was the first to assemble the known timber examples, which dated from as early as 1200 BC and extended into the medieval period. Because traces of early wooden structures were often scanty or oblique, Horn used scientific methods to uncover their architectural principles, and demonstrated that these were developed and applied to stone cathedrals in the Romanesque and Gothic periods.\n\nThe 1958 article was significant also in that it marked Horn's first collaboration with Ernest Born, the San Franciscan architect and draftsman with whom he was to author a series of books and articles over the next twenty years. Their first book was \"The Barns of the Abbey of Beaulieu at Its Granges of Great Coxwell and Beaulieu St. Leonard\" (1965), a study of the only two Cistercian tithe barns, dating from the 13th century, that survive in England. But their major project was the three-volume work \"The Plan of St. Gall: A Study of the Architecture and Economy of, and Life in a Paradigmatic Carolingian Monastery\", which has been called \"one of the greatest monographs on medieval architecture that has ever appeared.\"\n\nThe plan of Saint Gall had engaged Horn's imagination and curiosity since he was introduced to it by his mentor Erwin Panofsky. In 1957, Horn had participated in an international congress on the plan, and his interest in its guest and service buildings led to his survey of medieval structures in France and England. In 1965, Horn and Born contributed to the creation of a scale model of the 40 buildings rendered on the plan. The model was displayed at the international exhibit \"Karl der Grosse\" held at Aachen. Their two decades of collaboration culminated in a work of 1,056 pages with an estimated 1,200 illustrations.\n\n\"The Plan of St. Gall\" was praised by French historian Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie for its \"prodigious scholarship,\" and for its wide-ranging elucidation of Carolingian daily life. The first volume offers a reconstruction of the church and the living quarters for a community of monks numbering about a hundred. The second volume covered the guest and service buildings and the horticultural spaces for growing vegetables, medicinal herbs, and fruit and nut trees. The third volume contains supplemental material such as Horn's 88-page catalogue of the plan's explanatory \"tituli\", or captions, and Charles W. Jones' English translation of the \"Consuetudines Corbienses\" by Adalhard of the abbey of Corbie. Through meticulous reimagining of the activities that the architecture was meant to facilitate, Horn presents a rich picture of Carolingian life and thought.\n\nThe most controversial aspect of the work was Horn's major thesis: that the plan was a copy of a lost master plan dating to 816 or 817 that would have been part of documents pertaining to the official monastic reform movement under Louis the Pious at Aachen. The dominant strand of criticism to the contrary holds that the plan was intended to represent an ideal and was never meant to be carried out at a particular site. Horn's last article on the plan, \"The Medieval Monastery as a Setting for the Production of Manuscripts,\" was a response to this criticism.\n\n\"The Plan of St. Gall\" earned twelve major awards for its scholarship, bookmaking, and typography, including a prize from France's Académie d'architecture and a 1982 medal from the American Institute of Architects.\n\nIn 1974, Horn retired to emeritus status after 36 years at the University of California. His last publication, \"The Forgotten Hermitage of Skellig Michael\" (1990), co-authored with Jenny White Marshall and Grellan D. Rourke, resulted from fieldwork begun in 1978 on Ireland's Atlantic offshore islands. His interest in the Celtic roundhouse had been indicated earlier in \"On the Origins of the Medieval Cloister\" (1973).\n\nHorn worked with classical archaeologist Darrell A. Amyx to establish History of Art as a separate department at the University of California in 1971. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 1970) and of the Medieval Academy of America (1980). Horn was an active supporter of arts institutions outside academia, serving as trustee of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and chairman of the museum's acquisitions committee. He was on the board of the College Art Association 1950–54 and 1964–68 and on the board of the Society of Architectural Historians 1964–68.\n\nHorn died at home of pneumonia on Tuesday, 26 December 1995, at Point Richmond, California. He was 87. He was survived by his wife, Alberta; his son, Michael; two daughters, Rebecca and Robin; and a grandson, Matthew. His obituary in the \"New York Times\" labeled him \"historian of medieval cloisters and barns.\" Horn was remembered by colleagues as one of the university's \"best-loved and most influential teachers and … most effective leaders.\" He was eulogized for \"his oratorical skills and uncanny ability to bring the medieval building or pile of ruins vividly to life. His eloquence and grace matched his endless curiosity about prehistoric and medieval buildings in northern Europe and how people utilized them.\"\n\nStandard biographical and publishing data on Horn not otherwise cited comes from two or more of the following sources.\n"}

Active in Berlin and in their hometown, Breslau (Wrocław), the brothers were known for drawings, pastels, engravings, miniature paintings, and lithographs.\n\nWilhelm and his brothers were born of a Jewish family, in Trachenberg (Żmigród), and grew up in Breslau, then in Prussian Silesia. Their father, Hirsch Henschel, was a merchant; their uncle (Hirsch's older brother) Elias Henschel (1755-1839) was a prominent physician. In Breslau the brothers attended the new Jewish secular school (the Wilhelmschule, founded 1791), where, among other subjects, they learned drawing.\n\nThe brothers moved to Berlin around 1804 to pursue their art; in that year Wilhelm Henschel exhibited for the first time at the Prussian Academy of Arts. In 1806 all four brothers had individual entries in the Academy exhibition; and in 1810 they collectively participated with some ten works, including pastels and engravings.\n\nThe Henschel brothers' oeuvre focused on portraits (including memorial portraiture), theater and ballet performances, and cityscapes. Besides producing engravings, they were among the first in Berlin to experiment with the new printing technique of lithography.\n\nBetween 1809 and 1818 they published a series of engravings depicting the popular German actor August Wilhelm Iffland, in scenes from plays, under the title \"Ifflands mimische Darstellungen für Schauspieler und Zeichner\", in 20 issues, of six plates each. The drawings on which the works were based were mainly by Wilhelm Henschel, while August Henschel was responsible for the engravings. The drawings were made from life during performances Iffland gave at Prussia's royal national theater (Königliches Nationaltheater) between 1808 and 1811, in roles such as King Lear, Shylock, and Wilhelm Tell (in the play by Schiller); each depicted a particular scene and was captioned with lines from the play.\n\nIn an age in which the theater held a central place in German culture, the Henschel brothers conceived of these works as an aid to actors, artists, and the educated public for grasping the art of expression; and believed that the best means of engaging the intellect was through a combination of text and image. The eminent Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who was familiar with the Henschels' work, took note of the Iffland publication in his periodical \"Über Kunst und Altertum\", remarking favorably on the skill with which they captured Iffland's expressions and gestures.\n\nIn 1812 the Prussian Academy of Arts bestowed upon Wilhelm Henschel and his brother August the title “Akademische Künstler” (academic artist), although, as Jews, they were never members of the academy.\n\nIn 1819, in honor of Goethe's 70th birthday, the Henschel brothers began work on a series of pictures depicting scenes from the poet's life, based on episodes he recounts in the first volume of his autobiography (\"Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit\"). They dedicated the work to the Prussian king, Friedrich Wilhelm III, and sent the king a first printing of an initial set, in May 1819; the series was finally completed and published in its entirety as \"Scenen aus Goethe's Leben\" (Scenes from Goethe's life) in 1821.\n\nThe Henschel brothers produced portraits of many personalities of Berlin of their times, including Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Wilhelm von Humboldt, August von Kotzebue, and Julius von Voss. They produced numerous portraits for the king and his family, including memorial portraits following the death of Queen Luise, in 1810.\n\nWhen August Henschel died in 1828, Wilhelm returned to his home city of Breslau; his two other brothers, Friedrich and Moritz, had already done so at an earlier point, even as they had all continued to work as an artistic team.\n\n\n"}
