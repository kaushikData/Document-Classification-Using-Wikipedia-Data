Such Filipinos are announced, by virtue of a Presidential Proclamation, as \"National Artist\", having been conferred membership in the Order of National Artists. Benefits they enjoy from then on include a monthly pension, medical and life insurance, arrangements for a state funeral, a place of honor at national state functions, and recognition at cultural events.\n\nOn July 16, 2013, the controversy finally ended after the Supreme Court of the Philippines voted 12-1-2 that voided the four proclamations created by former President Gloria Arroyo that made these people National Artists.\n\nThe controversy began when conferred the Order of National Artists to seven individuals in July, 2009. Controversy arose from the revelation that musician Ramon Santos had been dropped from the list of nominees short-listed in May that year by the selection committee, and four other individuals had been nominated to the title via \"President’s prerogative\":\n\nMembers of the Philippine art community, including a number of living National Artists of the Philippines, protested that the proclamation politicized the title of National artist, and made it \"a way for President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to accommodate her allies.\"\n\nFilm director Eddie Romero, himself a National Artist for Film and the Broadcast Arts, explained in an interview that the rules allow the President to pick a National Artist. He noted, however, that: “\"It seems it’s the first time the presidential prerogative was used to declare four artists. It’s like a wholesale declaration\".”\n\nNational Artist for literature chairman of the Concerned Artists of the Philippines Bienvenido Lumbera, said that in the 2009 nominations, there was “\"heavy campaigning because the government wanted to ensure the selection of four people.\"”\n\nIn addition, specific protests were raised regarding the nomination of NCCA executive director Guidote-Alvarez, because it was purportedly a breach of protocol and propriety, and of Carlo Caparas, because protestors assert that he is not qualified to be nominated under either the \"Visual Arts\" or \"Film\" categories in which he was proclaimed to the order.\n\nLumbera, who happened to be a member of the combined “final selection committee\" of the NCAA and CCP, noted that: “\"It was Cecile Guidote-Alvarez, as executive director of the NCCA, who had insisted on the President’s right to add names that were not discussed in the committee.\"”\n\nCalling the situation \"outrageous\", he said that:“\"She should have not allowed herself to be named as national artist. She’s close to the President. Nobody in the committee thought that she deserved to be named.\"\" Alvarez heads the NCAA secretariat that receives nominations for national artists.\n\nComplaints regarding Caparas' proclamation centered on the complaints that he did not illustrate the comic books he wrote and therefore did not meet the qualifications for being honored under the visual arts category, and the assertion of protesting artists that his work in the category of Film is supposedly \"sub-par\", being largely exploitation films: \"pito-pito\" (\"seven-seven\") films rush-finished in seven days, and \"massacre films\" whose focus was sensational crimes.\n\nBienvenido Lumbera remarked that Caparas’ nomination was twice rejected by two NCAA panels: “\"<nowiki>[Caparas]</nowiki> was first proposed as a nominee for literature, but the committee rejected him. He was again proposed as nominee for visual artist but the panel again turned him down.\"\" Film Academy of the Philippines director general Leo Martinez noted that \"\"He was obviously added by Malacañang\".\" Caparas is known as a vocal supporter of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.\n\nProtestors, however, were careful to note that three of the individuals proclaimed as National Artist in 2009 were in fact recommended by the selection committee:\n\nProtesters also lamented the dropping of musician Ramon Santos from the list of new National Artists. Philippine entertainment news website PEP says that a CCP official, who had asked not to be named, revealed that Santos actually won the most number of votes during the selection process. Lumbera verbalized dismay about the snubbing of Santos, saying:\n\"What makes this even more outrageous is that Ramon Santos, who received a good number of votes in the panel selection, was dropped from the list. The basis for him being scrapped, one doesn't know\" \n\nThe same report that quoted Lumbera also noted that \"Santos still has not spoken about the whole brouhaha up to this day.<nowiki>[August 4, 2009]</nowiki>\"\n\nAnother aspect of the controversy regards the existence and of the Palace Honors committee which allegedly prepared the final list of nominees, which was eventually enacted by Arroyo.\n\nProtesters claim that they were not aware of the existence of such a committee, and that at first, they had no idea who precisely were supposed to be on the committee. According to them, nominating committees were made by the CCP and NCCA, and a final list of nominees was prepared by a joint committee. NCCA sub-commission on the arts head Ricardo de Ungria, one of the panelists involved in the selection process, insisted before a congressional committee meeting on the matter that the arts community “\"were never apprised of the existence of this animal since the start of the selection process this year or eight years ago.\"”\n\nAccording to Malacañang and to Cecille Guidote-Alvarez,however, the selection process had always involved the participation of three committees - those of the CCP, the NCCA and the Malacañang honors committee, whose head was Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita.\n\nLiving National Artists of the Philippines who have protested the proclamation of the four new National Artists include:\n\nOther prominent critics include prominent Filipino Comic Book artist Gerry Alanguilan, multiple Palanca Award laureate Lourd de Veyra, Film Academy of the Philippines Director General Leo Martinez (who had played a part in the original nomination process), and blogging social critic Vicente Soria de Veyra who wrote a series of blog essays against \"the myth of the national artist\".\n\nThe Arroyo administration was quick to defend its choices of individuals to be named to the Order of National Artists. Acting Executive Secretary and Presidential political adviser Gabriel Claudio told reporters that:\n\"\"<nowiki>I think we can defend [their] track record and qualifications and reasons [for their selection]</nowiki>.\"”\nHe also said the administration would “\"stand by the qualifications, qualities, track record and reputation of those named as National Artists.\"”\n\nCaparas defended his proclamation, saying that other aspirants to the honor ought to wait their turn.\n\n“\"Ganyan talaga kung may something for grabs. E, iisa lang ang pipiliin. Sana, maghintay na lang sila ng tamang panahon sa gusto nilang manalo. Hindi naman ito palakasan.\"”(That's the way it is whenever something is for grabs. Only one person can be selected. They ought to wait for the right time for them if they want to win. It's not as if this were a case of sucking up.)\n\"Kaya wag mag-alala ang mga critics ko, may pagkakataon pa sila o ang mga manok nila na manalo in the future.\" (So my critics shouldn't worry, they or their fighting cocks still have opportunities to win in the future.) They cannot take the award from me anymore.\"\"\n“\"Baka ang nasa isip nila ay bata pa ako. Pero hindi naman ‘yon ang basehan. Sino naman ang ko-contest sa decision ng Cultural Center, ng NCCA at ng Malacañang tungkol sa award na ito? Mabuti na nga at ngayon pa lang ay ibinibigay na ang ganitong award sa mga taong nandito. Ang akala kasi nila ay sa matatanda o sa beterano o sa mga patay na ibinibigay ang ganitong award.\"” (Maybe they think I'm too young. But that's not a valid basis <nowiki>[for a choice]</nowiki>. Who would contest the decision of the Cultural Center, the NCCA, and Malacañang regarding this award? It's a good thing they're giving this award to someone who's still here. They think awards like this should only be given to the old, to veterans, or to the dead.)\n\nCaparas said that instead of criticizing his award, entertainment people “\"should unite and work together to revive the ailing movie and komiks industry.\"” He attributed his win to the fact that he managed to cross over from comic books to film and television, and saying that his triumph was significant because he was a National Artist who came from the working class. “\"I am a National Artist who came from the masses,\" the Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted him as saying. \"I work and struggle with them.\"” He said it was time for a National Artist “w\"ho the masses can identify with—someone who walks beside them, someone who can inspire them.\"” Noting that some Filipinos did not even know the National Artists he said “\"Hopefully, since I am still active in TV and in the movies, this will encourage our countrymen to learn more about our National Artists.\"”\n\nOthers who have come to his defense include Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) director and former Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) chief Manoling Morato, Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC) head Dante Jimenez, boxer Manny Pacquiao, Senators Ramon Revilla Jr. and Jinggoy Estrada, Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino chair Joe Lad Santos, and Polytechnic University of the Philippines president Dante Guevarra.\n\nGuidote-Alvarez also defended her qualifications for receiving the award. “\"Before you make a judgment,\" she said, \"read my achievements first as an artist. Was I an idiot before I became a national artist?\"\" As proof of her achievements, she cited previous awards, including the Ramon Magsaysay public service award for the arts, the CCP Gawad Sining Award for Literature, and the Outstanding Women in the Nation's Services award. She also cited her important role in the development of Philippine theater, having founded the Philippine Educational Theatre Association (PETA) in 1967. She asserted that the President had the prerogative to name national artists who were not named in the selection committee's shortlist, and denied lobbying for the award, saying that President Arroyo had “\"never talked to\" [her]\" about it.\"\"\n\nOn July 27, 2009, it was announced to the public that President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo had named seven National Artists for 2009: National Commission on Culture and the Arts executive director Cecille Guidote Alvarez (theater); Manuel Conde (film and broadcast arts, posthumous); Lazaro Francisco (literature, posthumous); Federico Aguilar Alcuaz (visual arts in painting, sculpture and mixed media); Magno Jose Carlo Caparas (visual arts and film); Francisco Mañoza (architecture); and Jose \"Pitoy\" Moreno (fashion design).\n\nBy August 1, 2009, it had been revealed by members of the final selection committee, comprising members from the NCCA and CCP, that only Conde, Alcuaz and Francisco had been short-listed by the selection committee in May. Alvarez, Caparas,Mañosa, and Moreno had been included via what was referred to as the \"President’s prerogative\". They also revealed that a fourth nominee, Ramon Santos (shortlisted for music), had not been conferred the order as recommended by committee – also supposedly part of the president's prerogative. Various artists' groups in the Philippines began to protest, notably the Concerned Artists of the Philippines. Over the next few days, previously conferred members of the Order of National Artists, notably Eddie Romero, F. Sionil Jose, Bienvenido Lumbera, Virgilio Almario, and BenCab A number of members of the Comic Book industry, notably Gerry Alanguilan, also protested.\n\nOn August 6, Representatives Ana Theresia Hontiveros and Walden Bello of the Akbayan Party-list filed House Resolution 1305 at the Philippine House of Representatives, calling for a congressional inquiry into the controversy to make sure that the choice of national artists would not be subject to the “whims\" of ranking government officials. Hontiveros noted: \"Choosing national artists should fundamentally be about contribution in the arts and culture, not patronage or closeness to Malacañang. Choosing eminent symbols of Filipino arts and culture should be left in the hands of the arts community.\"\n\nAlso on August 15, the ABS CBN News Channel (ANC) hosted an episode of Cheche Lazaro's Media in Focus, in which the controversial awardees in the person of Caparas and Alavarez were supposed to face off with protesting artists in the person of National Artist Eddie Romero, CCP Chair Emily Abrera, Palanca Award Hall of Fame Awardee Butch Dalisay, and film critic Alexis Tioseco. The first segment of the show allowed Caparas and Dalisay to air their side, while Alvarez was unable to arrive in time to join the second part of a show, which would have had her on a panel with Romero and Abrera, who were protesting the circumstances of her proclamation to the order.\n\nOn August 7, protesters gathered at the front ramp of the Cultural Center of the Philippines for a major protest action in the form of a mock “necrological service”. National Artists who joined the protesters were Napoleon Abueva (visual arts), Arturo Luz (visual arts), Ben Cabrera (visual arts), F. Sionil Jose (literature), Bienvenido Lumbera (literature), Virgilio Almario (literature) and Salvador Bernal (theater design). Relatives of deceased National Artists also participated in the event, with singer Celeste Legaspi representing her late father Cesar Legaspi (National Artist for visual arts), and Raul Locsin representing his late brother Leandro Locsin (National Artist for architecture). Protesters offered black roses \"to symbolize the death of the National Artist Awards.\"\n\nDuring the protests, the Concerned Artists of the Philippines group, through its chair Lumbera informed the media that they “might seek court injunction\" at the Supreme Court \"against the proclamation of the new national artists.\"\n\nAfter the mock ceremony, participants continued the protest with a motorcade which ended at the offices of the NCCA, where Alvarez serves as head. This led to loud verbal confrontations between protesters and supporters of Alvarez.\n\nOn August 19 a group of National Artists and supporters, led by National Artists for Literature Bienvenido Lumbera and Virgilio Almario, asked filed a 38-page petition at the Supreme Court \"for prohibition, certiorari and injunction with prayer for restraining order to prevent the Palace from conferring the title to respondents,\" to stop \"the release of the monetary benefits, entitlements and emoluments… to private respondents arising from such conferment,\" and the \"holding of the acknowledgement ceremonies for their recognition.\" The petition asserted that: \"For the President to cavalierly disregard the collective judgment of the CCP and NCCA boards, and substitute her own judgment without a clear indication of the reasons and bases, therefore, is an unacceptable and manifestly grave abuse of discretion.\" \n\nOn August 25 the Supreme Court issued a status quo order, stopping Malacañang from conferring the honor pending deliberation of the petition to disqualify Alvarez, Caparas, Mañosa, and Moreno. Supreme Court spokesman Jose Midas Marquez noted that: \"The court saw the urgency to issue the status quo order and stop the conferment of the awards. It has the same as a temporary restraining order.\"\n\nThe incident involving Caparas has also been the subject of vandalism in Wikipedia, where anonymous editors and newly registered accounts maliciously edited the article, substituting the titles with nonsensical ones containing Tagalog pejoratives.\n\nOn August 31, 2009, Dalisay claimed in his column in \"The Philippine Star\" that the NCCA web page regarding the selection process for national artists had been changed:When I looked up the National Artists page on the NCCA website, the rules had suddenly changed — now there was a mention of Executive Order 236 empowering an Honors Committee to make up its own list of NA nominees to the President. That wasn’t there before the recent [National Artist] scandal blew up — neither the rule nor the role of the committee in the NAA process.\n\nOn September 14, 2009, the Philippines' House of Representatives began its committee inquiry into the National Artist controversy. In her testimony before the committee, CCP director and lawyer Lorna Kapunan alleged that the Malacañang honors committee had not actually held a meeting to deliberate on the nominees, and that minutes of the said meeting were therefore forged. Alvarez denied the allegations, and insisted that the selection process for National Artists of the Philippines had always involved the participation of three committees – those of the CCP, the NCCA and the Malacañang honors committee.\n\nOn the same day, the CCP submitted to the Supreme Court its 31-page comment regarding the petition to disqualify the National Artists added by Malacañang to the list of nominees. The CCP reiterated its position that the four had not been in the original list of nominees. It also requested the Supreme Court to order the proclamation of its four original choices as 2009's National Artists.\n\nOn July 16, 2013, the Supreme Court voided former President Arroyo's proclamations awarding National Artists to Alvarez, Caparas, Mañosa and Moreno, four years after the said proclamations. Arroyo inserted these names although they were not part of the recommendations created by the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the National Commission on Culture and Arts. The original nominees were Lazaro Francisco (literature), Dr. Ramon Santos (music), Manuel Conde (film and broadcast) and Federico Aguilar Alcuaz (visual arts, painting, sculpture and mixed media). The justices voted 12-1-2 that struck down the 4 proclamations.\n\nOn June 20, 2014, Dr. Ramon Santos was named as one of six new National Artists.\n"}

Although anonymous, it could have been John of Paris, master of the University of Paris. The treatise examines the relationship between Church and King through a fictional dialogue between a Priest and a Knight. \n\nIt was written during the period of the acrimonious dispute between King Philip IV and Pope Boniface VIII, which culminated in the Papal bull \"Unam sanctam\" of 1302. It is essentially propaganda. The furious reaction of Philip and his ministry expressed in the \"Disputatio\" (written in simple language for a popular audience) can be understood within the context of a conflict between the increasing power of secular rulers in France and England, who were attempting to tax the clergy to support warfare. Boniface's stringent reaction was the fierce bull \"Clericis laicos\" of 1296, which set off the dispute. The dialogue can be fitted into the context of the debate over the extent of church powers that was raging in the time delimited by the two bulls.\n\nHowever, the work remained unknown in its own time and was not published until 1378. A translation by John Trevisa (1342-1402) was popular in England because of its antipapalism, and it continued to be popular in the 16th century for similar reasons.\n\nIn the story the knight and priest exchange rapid fire and simple dialogue designed to reach a broad audience. The knight's intention is to prove that soft-living wealthy clerics, who have more money than needed, should hand the extra income over to secular leaders, whose job it is to deal in more earthly affairs. Specifically it is the job of secular leaders to protect the Church from outside threats, and the Church must pay the nobles for their own protection. Within the realm of the kingdom, kings have ultimate authority over all matters and the Church must obey the right of the king to tax the Church for the purpose of protection. If it refuses, the king may seize Church property.\n\n\"Disputatio\" was a sharp criticism of the church and foreshadowed further 14th century arguments that pitted royalist national sovereignty against the principles of papal supremacy.\n\nJohn of Paris also wrote a related work entitled \"On Royal and Papal Power\" about the autonomous nature of kingdoms, an early expression of the concept of sovereignty.\n\n\n"}

It is a Grade I listed structure.\n\nThe Animal Wall was designed by William Burges in 1866, but it was not built until 1890, after Burges's death in 1881. The work of the restoration of Cardiff Castle and the building of the Animal Wall for the Marquess of Bute, was continued by his former assistant William Frame. The original nine animal figures were sculptured by Thomas Nicholls, they were the hyena, wolf, baboons, seal, bear, lioness, lynx, and 2 different lions. They were painted in naturalistic colours, although since then the paint work on the sculptures has been removed.\n\nThe wall was moved about from outside Cardiff Castle to its present location outside Bute Park in 1922, due to road widening in front of the castle in Duke Street and Castle Street (now the A4161). \n\nIn 1931 a further six animals were added; the pelican, ant-eater, raccoons, leopard, beaver and vulture. They were all sculptured by Alexander Carrick. \n\nThe original nine, sculpted by Thomas Nicholls, had glass eyes and were painted in naturalistic colours to make them seem even more lifelike. But the paint peeled after a couple of years and was never replaced, leaving the bare stone seen today.\n\nThe animals reached the peak of their popularity in the 1930s when the South Wales Echo ran a children’s cartoon strip – the Keepers of the Wall – that depicted them involved in adventures around the city.\n\nPenned by Dorothy Howard Rowlands characters included William the seal, Priscilla the pelican, Martha and Oscar the monkeys; however, the statues are actually baboons. Larry the lynx and Romulus and Remus the two lions.\n\nThe inside of the castle also features animals carved in stone, including many lions, as these were a symbol of Lord Bute’s family.\n\nIn the 1970s Council planners had wanted to demolish the Animal Wall to widen the Castle Street again, but this idea was later abandoned.\n\nAs part of a £5.6 million refurbishment of Bute Park, restoration of the animals began in July 2010. During the repair, the anteater's nose, which has been missing since the late 90s, was replaced as well as the missing glass eyes in the nine original animals. This work was completed in October 2010.\n\n"}

Traditionally this test was developed for the textiles industry but it has now been adopted by the printing industry as measure of lightfastness of ink colourants.\n\nNormally two identical dye samples are created. One is placed in the dark as the control and the other is placed in the equivalent of sunlight for a three-month period. A standard bluewool textile fading test card is also placed in the same light conditions as the sample under test.\nThe amount of fading of the sample is then assessed by comparison to the original colour.\n\nA rating between 0 and 8 is awarded by identifying which one of the eight strips on the bluewool standard card has faded to the same extent as the sample under test.\n\nZero denotes extremely poor colour fastness whilst a rating of eight is deemed not to have altered from the original and thus credited as being lightfast and permanent.\n\nThe ultraviolet (UV) radiation in light is responsible for ink fading. As the intensity of UV radiation differs from place to place, the ink fading also depends on place. It will be more in areas with more UV radiation and vice versa. This difficulty is overcome by the bluewool testing method. Absolute values of fading will depend on light intensity. Relative values of fading, comparing the sample with the standard blue test strip, will depend less on intensity. For example, if a pigment is rated as \"BW5\" it can be expected to fade to the same degree as strip number 5 on a bluewool test card, for any specific light exposure. The method of comparison between the sample and a test strip enables accelerated testing to be carried out under intense artificial illumination.\n"}

{"id": "851600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=851600", "title": "Dress code", "text": "Dress code\n\nA dress code is a set of written and, more often, unwritten rules with regard to clothing. Clothing, like other aspects of human physical appearance, has a social significance, with different rules and expectations applying depending on circumstance and occasion. Within a single day, an individual may need to navigate between two or more dress codes. For example, many navigate between a home dress code and a work dress code; usually this ability is a result of cultural acclimatization. Different societies and cultures will have different dress norms, although Western dress codes are widely accepted as valid internationally.\n\nThe dress code has built in rules or signals indicating the message being given by a person's clothing and how it is worn. This message may include indications of the person's gender, income, occupation and social class, political, ethnic and religious affiliation, attitude towards comfort, fashion, traditions, gender expression, marital status, sexual availability, and sexual orientation, etc. Clothes convey other social messages including the stating or claiming personal or cultural identity, the establishing, maintaining, or defying social group norms, and appreciating comfort and functionality.\n\nFor example, wearing expensive clothes of high quality can communicate wealth or the image of wealth. The observer sees the expensive clothes, but may misinterpret the extent to which these factors apply to the wearer. Clothing can convey a social message, even if none is intended: if the receiver's code of interpretation differs from the sender's code of communication, misinterpretation follows. However clothes may be worn because they are comfortable and practical, not to convey a message.\n\nIn every culture, current fashion governs how clothing is constructed, assembled, and worn to convey a social message. The rate of change of fashion varies, clothes and its accessories within months or days, especially in small social groups or in communications media-influenced modern societies. More extensive changes, requiring more time, money, and effort to effect, may span generations. When fashion changes, the messages communicated by clothing change.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the used a dress code to differentiate themselves from other classes of people.\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast had a complex social structure, including slaves, commoners, and nobles, and dress codes to indicate these social distinctions. John R. Jewitt, an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the Nuu-chah-nulth people in 1802-1805, describes how, after some time living there, Maquinna and the chiefs decided that he must now be \"considered one of them, and conform to their customs\". Jewitt resented the imposition of this dress code, finding the loose untailored garments very cold, and attributed to them a subsequent illness of which he almost died. He was not allowed to cut his hair, and had to paint his face and body as a Nootka would.\n\nIn most traditions, certain types of clothing are worn exclusively or predominantly by either men or women. For example, long sleeves are common for both genders, and while the wearing of a knee- \nto floor-length skirt or a knee- to floor-length dress tends to be associated with female dress, ankle-length trousers are associated with male dress. Hairdressing in some societies may also conform to a dress code, such as long hair for women and short hair for men.\n\nIn many societies, particular clothing may be a status symbol, reserved or affordable to people of high rank. For example, in Ancient Rome only senators were permitted to wear garments dyed with Tyrian purple; and, in traditional Hawaiian society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear feather cloaks and palaoa or carved whale teeth. In China before the establishment of the republic, only the emperor could wear yellow.\n\nIn 1996, former U. S. President Bill Clinton announced his support for the idea of school uniforms by stating, “School uniforms are one step that may help break the cycle of violence, truancy and disorder by helping young students understand what really counts is what kind of people they are.” Many school districts in the United States took up the idea. By requiring students to wear a school uniform they are less likely to have something to make fun of other students for. This would cause the students to get to know one another by their personality and who they really are rather than the clothes they wear.\n\nMilitary, police, and firefighters usually wear uniforms, as do workers in many industries. School children often wear school uniforms, while college and university students sometimes wear academic dress. Members of religious orders may wear uniforms known as habits. Sometimes a single item of clothing or a single accessory can declare one's occupation or rank within a profession\n\nIn many regions of the world, national costumes and styles in clothing and ornament declare membership in a certain village, caste, religion, etc. A Scotsman declares his clan with his tartan. A French peasant woman identified her village with her cap or coif. A Palestinian woman identifies her village with the pattern of embroidery on her dress.\n\nClothes can also proclaim dissent from cultural norms and mainstream beliefs, as well as personal independence. In 19th-century Europe, artists and writers lived \"la vie de Bohème\" and dressed to shock: George Sand in men's clothing, female emancipationists in bloomers, male artists in velvet waistcoats and gaudy neckcloths. Bohemians, beatniks, hippies, Goths, Punks, and Skinheads have continued the (countercultural) tradition in the 20th-century West.\n\nA Jewish or Muslim man may display his religious affiliation by wearing a cap and other traditional clothing. Many Muslim women wear head or body coverings (see sartorial hijab, hijab, burqa or niqab, chador, and abaya) that proclaim their status as respectable women and cover the so-called intimate parts. A Jewish man may indicate his observance of Judaism by wearing a kippah.\n\nTraditionally, Hindu women wear \"sindoor\", a red powder, in the parting of their hair to indicate their married status; if widowed, they abandon \"sindoor\" and jewelry and wear simple white clothing. However, this is not true of all Hindu women; in the modern world this is not a norm and women without sindoor may not necessarily be unmarried.\n\nIn many Orthodox Jewish circles, married women wear head coverings such as a hat, snood, or wig. Additionally, after their marriage, Jewish men of Ashkenazi descent begin to wear a talit during prayer.\n\nMen and women of the Western world may wear wedding rings to indicate their married status, and women may also wear engagement rings when they are engaged.\n\nIn New Guinea and Vanuatu, there are areas where it is customary for the men to wear nothing but penis sheaths in public - this is uncommon in more developed areas. Women wear string skirts. In remote areas of Bali, women may go topless. In America and some parts of Europe, there are nude beaches.\n\nIn the United States, a few businesses or restaurants display dress code signs requiring shoes and shirts, claiming to be there on account of a health code, although no such health codes exist. Also, it is a common belief that there are laws against driving barefoot. However, no such laws exist. It is quite uncommon for people to be nude in public in the United States and in many circumstances, it is illegal. Many states and cities have laws and ordinances for indecent exposure and sometimes nudity can overlap with disorderly conduct. However, there are a few private beaches and resorts that cater to people who wish to be naked.\n\nThe “Free the Nipple Movement” is a global campaign seeking equality and empowerment for women when it comes to dress code. It emerged as a reaction to the idea that it was socially acceptable for men to appear without a shirt in public, whereas a woman appearing topless in public would be construed as indecent. The states of New York, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Ohio, and Texas have made it legal for both men and women to appear topless in public. The remainder of states consider the exposure of the female nipple to be an act of indecent exposure, putting them in a position where they can be charged with a criminal offense. This appears to be a gendered law that promotes different expectations on how a person is expected to dress when in public.\n\nThe Gender Nondiscrimination Act prohibits employers, health care providers, and housing authorities from discriminating against people on the basis of gender. While employers are not able to discriminate in their hiring practices, they do have the ability to create a gendered uniform. Employers cannot force someone to wear a uniform for a gender they do not identify themselves as, but this becomes an issue for non binary gendered people. In society, clothing is marketed by gender and dressing across this established line is often construed as an anomaly. Skirts, dresses, and high heels are clothing marketed almost exclusively for women. If a man wore any of these pieces in public it would be seen as outside of the norm.\n\nPrivate organisations may insist on particular dress codes or standards in particular situations.\n\n\nDress codes function on certain social occasions and for certain jobs. A military institution may require specified uniforms; if it allows the wearing of plain clothes it may place restrictions on their use.\n\nA \"formal\" or white tie dress code typically means tail-coats for men and full-length evening dresses for women. \"Semi-formal\" has a much less precise definition but typically means an evening jacket and tie for men (known as black tie) and a dress for women. \"Business casual\" typically means not wearing neckties or suits, but wearing instead collared shirts, and more \"country\" trousers (not black, but more \"relaxed\", including things such as corduroy). \"Casual\" typically just means clothing for the torso, legs and shoes. \"Wedding Casual\" defines yet another mode of dress, where guests dress respectfully, but not necessarily fancily. The uniform may consist of various items that are appropriate length and style depending on what the school suggests: for example, khaki pants or shorts, plaid skirts, a button-up collared shirt, a sweater, a coat and tie and even socks. Some schools have each grade assigned a color type which communicates what grade the student is currently in. That way if a student is lost someone is able to figure out what grade they are in just by looking at the color of their shirt. If the student is younger, older students and faculty are able to look out for them and make sure they are safe.\nOrganisations which seek to maintain standards of modesty have difficulties with sheer and see-through clothing.\n\nDress codes usually set a lower limit on body covering. However, sometimes it can specify the opposite: for example, in UK gay jargon, \"dress code\", means people who dress in a militaristic manner. \"Dress code\" nights in nightclubs, and elsewhere, are deemed to specifically target people who have militaristic fetishes (e.g. leather/skinhead men).\n\nDress codes were first implemented in the school system to prevent students from wearing inappropriate clothing items to school and was thought to create a safer and more professional environment. Even though dress code was created to positively affect schools, the rules actually impede on students' right to self-expression. There have been many court cases regarding school dress code, the first being the Tinker vs. Des Moines Independent School District. The case was held because students wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam war.\n\nIn some grade schools, students are prevented from wearing short shorts, leggings, crop tops, saggy pants, and other clothing items that are deemed \"too revealing\" or \"inappropriate\".\n\nIn colleges, the most common type of dress code is business casual, but most colleges don't have dress code requirements.\n\nNon-communicative dress code violations in public schools are violations that are without implications of hate, gang-affiliation, etc. Communicative dress code violations are violations of an explicit nature, where the clothing has implications of hate, violence, gang-affiliation, etc.\n\nIn cases where dress code rules in public school systems have been violated by noncommunicative clothing, courts repeatedly legitimise dress code discrimination based on gender. Amongst the transgender populations, gender based dress codes are primarily enforced against individuals who do not yet pass.\n\nWhite collar work place clothing has changed significantly through the years. In a corporate office, appropriate clothes are clean, business casual clothes such as (for men) a dress shirt, polo shirt, and trousers, or other similar outfits. Suits, neckties, and other formal wear are usually only required in law offices and financial sector offices. Previous business dress code eras (the 1950s in the U.S.) featured standardized business clothes that strongly differentiated what was acceptable and unacceptable for men and women to wear while working. Today, the two styles have merged; women's work clothes expanded to include the suit (and its variants) in addition to the usual dresses, skirts, and blouses; men's clothes have expanded to include garments and bright colours. \n\nCasual wear entered business culture with the advent of the Silicon Valley, California, technology company featuring casual work clothes on the job. Additionally, some companies set aside days — generally Fridays (\"dress-down Friday\", \"casual Friday\") — when workers may wear casual clothes. The clothing a company requires its worker to wear on the job varies with the occupation and profession.\n\nSome businesses observe that anti-discrimination law restricts their determining what is appropriate and inappropriate workplace clothing. Requiring men and women to dress differently at the workplace can be challenged because the gender-specific dress codes would be based on one sex and could be considered stereotypical. Yet, in fact, most businesses have much authority in determining and establishing what work place clothes they can require of their workers. Generally, a carefully drafted dress code applied consistently does not violate anti-discrimination laws.\n\n\"Business casual\" dress, also \"smart casual\", is a popular work place dress code that emerged in white-collar workplaces in Western countries in the 1990s, especially in the United States and Canada. Many information technology businesses in Silicon Valley were early adopters of this dress code. In contrast to formal business wear such as suits and neckties (the international standard business attire), the business casual dress code has no generally accepted definition; its interpretation differs widely among organizations and is often a cause of sartorial confusion among workers.\n\nThe job search engine Monster.com offers this definition: \"In general, business casual means dressing professionally, looking relaxed, yet neat and pulled together\". A more pragmatic definition is that business casual dress is the mid ground between formal business clothes and street clothes. Examples of clothing combinations considered appropriate for work by businesses that consider themselves as using the business-casual dress code are:\n\n\nGenerally, neckties are excluded from business casual dress, unless worn in nontraditional ways. The acceptability of blue jeans and denim cloth clothing varies — some businesses consider them to be sloppy and informal.\n\nInverse dress codes, sometimes referred to as \"undress code\", set forth an upper bound, rather than a lower bound, on body covering. An example of an undress code is the one commonly enforced in modern communal bathing facilities. For example, in the public bath SchwabenQuellen, no clothing of any kind is allowed in the sauna part of the resort. Other, less strict undress codes are common in public pools, especially indoor pools, in which shoes and shirts are disallowed.\n\nPlaces where social nudity is practiced may be \"clothing optional,\" or nudity may be compulsory, with exceptions. See issues in social nudity.\n\nSome clothing \"faux pas\" may occur intentionally for reasons of fashion or personal preference. People have the right to express themselves in freedom of speech and expression under the first amendment; however, some styles of clothing that people may chose to wear can be seen as taboos or violations. Dress codes are a way that public schools try to limit violence and danger in the classroom and at the school, as stated by Sue M. Stanley, a professor at California State University, Long Beach, in the journal of Education and Urban Society. She says how clothing styles, such as gang clothing, are linked with violence in schools. She believes that dress codes and uniforms will reduce the focus on fashion contests and violence and instead promote ideas and achievements. Violations of clothing taboos, such as students wearing gang clothing or intentionally baggy clothing, can be viewed as unsafe by administrators. However, these students are just expressing themselves in their style and fashion. For instance, the teenage boys of rap duo Kris Kross of the early 1990s wore all of their clothes backwards and extremely baggy. Just because the boys of the rap duo Kris Kross wore their clothing like this it did not make them dangerous. Rather, they were just trying to be different and break common fashion “rules” to express themselves. Limiting students to only wear certain things or uniforms because of fashion taboos is a violation against their freedom of expression. As stated by Paul M. Murphy, a lawyer and writer for the Southern California Law Review, in the article “Restricting Gang Clothing in Public Schools: Does a Dress Code Violate a Student's Right of Free Expression” in the Southern California Law Review, as an attempt to keep schools safe, administrators are prohibiting students from wearing gang related clothing. However this is a violation of the first amendment which is the freedom of speech and expression, says Paul M. Murphy.\nThere can be different clothing styles that can be viewed as taboo for different age groups and genders to wear as well. For example, for older women to wear brighter colors and revealing or overly suggestive clothing is seen as a clothing taboo for this era of women. This information was taken from a survey done by the journal of Ageing and Society, where they had 36 women from the ages 71 to 93 say what clothes they usually don't wear, to see what their perspective on clothing and different styles are for their age group. The majority of women said that they refrain from wearing styles such as bright colors and revealing or overly suggestive clothing. The women view these styles as taboo for their age, however that does not mean that one can not wear these clothing styles if they are in this age group.\nThere are different clothing brands and stores that can be seen as taboo as well. In a study done in the journal of Middle East Technical University Studies in Development, researchers took 300 participants in an emerging market context to see the effects of different styles and brands on the participants. The results were that customers were becoming less predictable and more diverse in their brands and clothing stores than before. This shows how people have lots of different styles of clothing and fashion, and how that is making clothing taboos become less common and not seen as a restriction.\n\nSocial attitudes to clothing have brought about various rules and social conventions, such as keeping the body covered, and not showing underwear in public. The backlash against these social norms has become a traditional form of rebellion. An example of rebellion of general, universal dress codes is cross dressing. Cross dressing is defined as wearing clothing typical of the opposite sex. This is a rebellion to dress codes, because it goes against most social norms of a general dress code for men and women. Also over time, western societies have gradually adopted more casual dress codes in the workplace, school, and leisure. This has especially been the case since the early 1960s.\n\nOn Monday, September 22, 2014, \"about 100 pupils walked out of Bingham high school in South Jordan, Utah.\" Students staged a walkout because more than a dozen girls were turned away from a homecoming dance for wearing dresses which violated the dress code rules. \"School staff allegedly lined up girls against a wall as they arrived and banished about two dozen for having dresses which purportedly showed too much skin and violated the rules.\" It is believed that this act was awkward and humiliating towards the female students, which spawned the walkouts.\n\nCertain dress code restrictions in schools across North America are believed to be perpetuating sexist standards, since they concentrate specifically on females and what they are and are not allowed to wear. There is also an emphasis placed on the effects that girls’ wardrobe choices have on their male classmates, which is seen by some as inappropriate. In March 2014, a group of middle-school girls from Evanston, Illinois protested their school's dress code, which prohibited them from wearing leggings to school under the pretense that it was “too distracting for boys.” Thirteen-year-old student, Sophie Hasty, was quoted in the Evanston Review saying that “not being able to wear leggings because it’s ‘too distracting for boys’ is giving us the impression we should be guilty for what guys do.” In a Time magazine article covering the incident, Eliana Dockterman argued that teachers and administration in these schools are “walking the fine line between enforcing a dress code and slut shaming.”\n\nIn September 2014, a similar incident occurred at Tottenville High School in Staten Island, New York. Within the first few days of the semester, two hundred detention slips were handed out to students who violated the school's dress code. Approximately ninety percent of the slips distributed were given to girls as their clothing was deemed “disruptive to teaching and learning.” Many claim that making girls feel guilty for the actions of boys is similar to telling victims of sexual assault that they were “asking for it” by dressing in a particular manner and has thus been linked to the practice of victim-blaming.\n\nA Canadian teenager, Lauren Wiggins, was given detention in May 2015 for wearing a floor-length dress with a halter neckline. The punishment prompted Wiggins to write an open letter to the school's assistant vice principal at Harrison Trimble High School in Moncton, New Brunswick. In the letter, Wiggins concentrated specifically on the fact that females are often blamed for the behaviour of males, saying that if a boy \"will get distracted by my upper back and shoulders then he needs to be sent home and practice self-control.\" She was then given a one-day suspension after writing and submitting the letter.\n\n"}
{"id": "154076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154076", "title": "Epiphany (feeling)", "text": "Epiphany (feeling)\n\nAn epiphany (from the ancient Greek ἐπιφάνεια, \"epiphaneia\", \"manifestation, striking appearance\") is an experience of a sudden and striking realization. Generally the term is used to describe scientific breakthrough, religious or philosophical discoveries, but it can apply in any situation in which an enlightening realization allows a problem or situation to be understood from a new and deeper perspective. Epiphanies are studied by psychologists and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of innovation.\n\nEpiphanies are relatively rare occurrences and generally follow a process of significant thought about a problem. Often they are triggered by a new and key piece of information, but importantly, a depth of prior knowledge is required to allow the leap of understanding. Famous epiphanies include Archimedes's discovery of a method to determine the density of an object (\"Eureka!\") and Isaac Newton's realization that a falling apple and the orbiting moon are both pulled by the same force.\n\nThe word epiphany originally referred to insight through the divine. Today, this concept is more often used without such connotations, but a popular implication remains that the epiphany is supernatural, as the discovery seems to come suddenly from the outside.\n\nThe word's secular usage may owe much of its popularity to Irish novelist James Joyce. The Joycean epiphany has been defined as \"a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind — the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it.\" The author used epiphany as a literary device within each entry of his short story collection \"Dubliners\" (1914); his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves and/or their social conditions. Joyce had first expounded on epiphany's meaning in the fragment \"Stephen Hero,\" although this was only published posthumously in 1944. For the philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas, epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another's face (see face-to-face).\n\nIn traditional and pre-modern cultures, initiation rites and mystery religions have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The Greek dramatists and poets would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of \"catharsis\" or \"kenosis\", respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of William Burroughs' \"Naked Lunch\", a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, \"a frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of the fork.\" Both the Dadaist Marcel Duchamp and the Pop Artist Andy Warhol would invert expectations by presenting commonplace objects or graphics as works of fine art (for example a urinal as a fountain), simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of \"what art is\" or is not.\n\nEpiphanies can come in many different forms, and are often generated by a complex combination of experience, memory, knowledge, predisposition and context. A contemporary example of an epiphany in education might involve the process by which a student arrives at some form of new insight or clarifying thought. Despite this popular image, epiphany is the result of significant work on the part of the discoverer, and is only the satisfying result of a long process. The surprising and fulfilling feeling of epiphany is so surprising because one cannot predict when one's labor will bear fruit, and our subconscious can play a significant part in delivering the solution; and is fulfilling because it is a reward for a long period of effort.\n\nA common myth predicts that most, if not all, innovations occur through epiphanies. Not all innovations occur through epiphanies; Scott Berkun notes that \"the most useful way to think of an epiphany is as an occasional bonus of working on tough problems\". Most innovations occur without epiphany, and epiphanies often contribute little towards finding the next one. Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled.\n\nAlthough epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, crowning a process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension are commonly responsible for leaps in technology and the sciences. Famous epiphanies include Archimedes' realization of how to estimate the volume of a given mass, which inspired him to shout \"Eureka!\" (\"I have found it!\"). The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which were worked out in detail over the following years. For example, allegedly Albert Einstein was struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein's life occurred in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations. While taking a streetcar home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in Bern and realized that if the car sped up close to the speed of light, he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later remarked, \"a storm broke loose in my mind,\" which would allow him to understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two years later in 1907 which he called \"the happiest thought of my life\" when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of falling, and the weightlessness of space - a thought which allowed him to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a curvature in spacetime. A similar flash of holistic understanding in a prepared mind was said to give Charles Darwin his \"hunch\" (about natural selection), and Darwin later stated that he always remembered the spot in the road where his carriage was when the epiphany struck. Another famous epiphany myth is associated with Isaac Newton's apple story, and yet another with Nikola Tesla's discovery of a workable alternating current induction motor. Though such epiphanies might have occurred, they were almost certainly the result of long and intensive periods of study those individuals had undertaken, rather than an out-of-the-blue flash of inspiration about an issue they had not thought about previously.\n\nAnother myth is that epiphany is simply another word for (usually spiritual) vision. Actually, realism and psychology make epiphany a different mode as distinguished from vision, even though both vision and epiphany are often triggered by (sometimes seemingly) irrelevant incidents or objects.\n\nIn Christianity, the Epiphany refers to a realization that Christ is the Son of God. Western churches generally celebrate the Visit of the Magi as the revelation of the Incarnation of the infant Christ, and commemorate the Feast of the Epiphany on January 6. Traditionally, Eastern churches, following the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, have celebrated Epiphany (or Theophany) in conjunction with Christ's baptism by John the Baptist and celebrated it on January 19; however, other Eastern churches have adopted the Western Calendar and celebrate it on January 6. Some Protestant churches often celebrate Epiphany as a season, extending from the last day of Christmas until either Ash Wednesday, or the Feast of the Presentation on February 2.\n\nIn more general terms, the phrase \"religious epiphany\" is used when a person realizes their faith, or when they are convinced that an event or happening was really caused by a deity or being of their faith. In Hinduism, for example, epiphany might refer to Arjuna's realization that Krishna (incarnation of God serving as his charioteer in the \"Bhagavad Gita\") is indeed representing the Universe. The Hindu term for epiphany would be bodhodaya, from Sanskrit bodha 'wisdom' and udaya 'rising'. Or in Buddhism, the term might refer to the Buddha obtaining enlightenment under the bodhi tree, finally realizing the nature of the universe, and thus attaining Nirvana. The Zen term \"kensho\" also describes this moment, referring to the feeling attendant on realizing the answer to a \"koan\".\n\n"}
{"id": "90317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=90317", "title": "Fine art", "text": "Fine art\n\nIn European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics or beauty, distinguishing it from applied art, which also has to serve some practical function, such as pottery or most metalwork.\n\nHistorically, the five main fine arts were painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and poetry, with performing arts including theatre and dance. Today, the fine arts commonly include additional forms, such as film, photography, video production/editing, design, sequential art, conceptual art, and printmaking.\n\nOne definition of \"fine art\" is \"a visual art considered to have been created primarily for aesthetic and intellectual purposes and judged for its beauty and meaningfulness, specifically, painting, sculpture, drawing, watercolor, graphics, and architecture.\" In that sense, there are conceptual differences between the \"fine arts\" and the \"applied arts\". As originally conceived, and as understood for much of the modern era, the perception of aesthetic qualities required a refined judgment usually referred to as having good taste, which differentiated fine art from popular art and entertainment.\n\nThe word \"fine\" does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons. This definition originally excluded the applied or decorative arts, and the products of what were regarded as crafts. In contemporary practice these distinctions and restrictions have become essentially meaningless, as the concept or intention of the artist is given primacy, regardless of the means through which this is expressed.\n\nAccording to some writers the concept of a distinct category of fine art is an invention of the early modern period in the West. Larry Shiner in his \"\" (2003) locates the invention in the 18th century:\n\"There was a traditional “system of the arts” in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. “Art”, in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English “skill”, a sense that has survived in phrases like “the art of war”, “the art of love”, and “the art of medicine.”\nSimilar ideas have been expressed by Paul Oskar Kristeller, Pierre Bourdieu, and Terry Eagleton (e.g. The Ideology of the Aesthetic), though the point of invention is often placed earlier, in the Italian Renaissance.\n\nThe separation of arts and crafts that often exists in Europe and the US is not shared by all other cultures. In Japanese aesthetics, the activities of everyday life are depicted by integrating not only art with craft but man-made with nature. Traditional Chinese art distinguished within Chinese painting between the mostly landscape literati painting of scholar gentlemen and the artisans of the schools of court painting and sculpture. A high status was also given to many things that would be seen as craft objects in the West, in particular ceramics, jade carving, weaving, and embroidery. Latin American art was dominated by European colonialism until the 20th-century, when indigenous art began to reassert itself inspired by the Constructivist Movement, which reunited arts with crafts based upon socialist principles. In Africa, Yoruba art often has a political and spiritual function. As with the art of the Chinese, the art of the Yoruba is also often composed of what would ordinarily be considered in the West to be craft production. Some of its most admired manifestations, such as sculpture and textiles, fall in this category.\n\nDrawing is a form of visual expression and is one of the major forms of the visual arts. Common instruments include: graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoals, chalk, pastels, markers, stylus, or various metals like silverpoint. There are a number of subcategories of drawing, including cartooning and creating comics. There remains debate whether the following is considered a part of “drawing” as “fine art”: \"doodling\", drawing in the fog a shower and leaving an imprint on the bathroom mirror, or the surrealist method of \"entopic graphomania\", in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and the lines are then made between the dots.\n\nMosaics are images formed with small pieces of stone or glass, called \"tesserae\". They can be decorative or functional. An artist who designs and makes mosaics is called a mosaic artist or a mosaicist.\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing, normally on paper. Except in the case of monotyping, the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print. Each print is considered an original, as opposed to a copy. The reasoning behind this is that the print is not a reproduction of another work of art in a different medium — for instance, a painting — but rather an image designed from inception as a print. An individual print is also referred to as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, known technically as a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric in the case of screen-printing. But there are many other kinds, discussed below. Multiple nearly identical prints can be called an edition. In modern times each print is often signed and numbered forming a \"limited edition.\" Prints may also be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.\n\nCalligraphy is a type of visual art. A contemporary definition of calligraphic practice is \"the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious and skillful manner\". Modern calligraphy ranges from functional hand-lettered inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the abstract expression of the handwritten mark may or may not compromise the legibility of the letters. Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may create all of these; characters are historically disciplined yet fluid and spontaneous, improvised at the moment of writing.\n\n\"Fine art photography\" refers to photographs that are created to fulfill the creative vision of the artist. Fine art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism and commercial photography. Photojournalism visually communicates stories and ideas, mainly in print and digital media. Fine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist’s vision, but has also been important in advancing certain causes.\n\nArchitecture is frequently considered a fine art, especially if its aesthetic components are spotlighted — in contrast to structural-engineering or construction-management components. Architectural works are perceived as cultural and political symbols and works of art. Historical civilizations often are known primarily through their architectural achievements. Such buildings as the pyramids of Egypt and the Roman Colosseum are cultural symbols, and are important links in public consciousness, even when scholars have discovered much about past civilizations through other means. Cities, regions and cultures continue to identify themselves with, and are known by, their architectural monuments.\n\nOne field where \"fine\" remains a valid technical term is pottery, especially in archaeology. \"Fine wares\" are high-quality pottery, often painted, moulded or otherwise decorated, and in many periods distinguished from \"coarse\" wares, which are basic utilitarian pots used by the mass of the population, or in the kitchen rather than for more formal purposes.\n\nSculpture is three-dimensional artwork created by shaping hard or plastic material, commonly stone (either rock or marble), metal, or wood. Some sculptures are created directly by ; others are assembled, built up and fired, welded, molded, or cast. Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the plastic arts. The majority of public art is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a garden setting may be referred to as a sculpture garden.\n\nConceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.\nThe inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of \"idea-based art\" that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text. However, through its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly in the UK, developed as a synonym for all contemporary art that does not practice the traditional skills of painting and sculpture.\n\nPoetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, \"making\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as sound symbolism, phonaesthetics and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.\n\nMusic is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \"color\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; \"art of the Muses\").\n\n\"Dance\" is an art form that generally refers to movement of the body, usually rhythmic, and to music, used as a form of expression, social interaction or presented in a spiritual or performance setting.\nDance is also used to describe methods of nonverbal communication (see body language) between humans or animals (bee dance, patterns of behaviour such as a mating dance), motion in inanimate objects \"(the leaves danced in the wind)\", and certain musical genres. In sports, gymnastics, figure skating and synchronized swimming are \"dance disciplines\" while the \"Katas\" of the martial arts are often compared to dances.\n\nModern Western theatre is dominated by realism, including drama and comedy. Another popular Western form is musical theatre. Classical forms of theatre, including Greek and Roman drama, classic English drama (Shakespeare and Marlowe included), and French theater (Molière included), are still performed today. In addition, performances of classic Eastern forms such as Noh and Kabuki can be found in the West, although with less frequency.\n\n\"Fine arts film\" is a term that encompasses motion pictures and the field of film as a fine art form. A \"fine arts movie theater\" is a venue, usually a building, for viewing such movies. Films are produced by recording images from the world with cameras, or by creating images using animation techniques or special effects. Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment and a powerful method for educating — or indoctrinating — citizens. The visual elements of cinema give motion pictures a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles that translate the dialogue.\n\nCinematography is the discipline of making lighting and camera choices when recording photographic images for the cinema. It is closely related to the art of still photography, though many additional issues arise when both the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion.\n\nIndependent filmmaking often takes place outside of Hollywood, or other major studio systems. An independent film (or \"indie film)\" is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a major movie studio. Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States an academic course of study in fine art may include the Bachelor of Arts in Fine Art, or a Bachelor of Fine Arts, and/or a Master of Fine Arts degree — traditionally the terminal degree in the field. Doctor of Fine Arts degrees —earned, as opposed to honorary degrees— have begun to emerge at some US academic institutions, however.\nMajor schools of art in the US:\n\n"}

Featuring an ensemble cast, the film is about random events affecting a diverse group of people, exploring the race- and class-imposed chasms which separate members of the same community.\n\nThe film was produced and distributed by 20th Century Fox and was released on Christmas Day, 1991. \"Grand Canyon\" was advertised as \"\"The Big Chill\" for the '90s\", in reference to an earlier Kasdan film.\n\nAfter attending a Lakers basketball game, an immigration lawyer named Mack (Kevin Kline) finds himself at the mercy of potential muggers when his car breaks down in a bad part of Los Angeles late at night. The muggers are talked out of their plans by Simon (Danny Glover), a tow truck driver who arrives just in time. Mack sets out to befriend Simon, despite their having nothing in common.\n\nIn the meantime, Mack's wife Claire (Mary McDonnell) and his best friend Davis (Steve Martin), a producer of violent action films, are experiencing life-changing events. Claire encounters an abandoned baby while jogging and becomes determined to adopt her. Davis suddenly becomes interested in philosophy rather than box-office profits after being shot in the leg by a man trying to steal his watch, vowing to devote the remainder of his career to eliminating violence from the cinema.\n\nThe film chronicles how these characters—as well as various acquaintances, co-workers and relatives—are affected by their interactions in the light of life-changing events. In the end, they visit the Grand Canyon on a shared vacation trip, united in a place that is philosophically and actually \"bigger\" than all their little separate lives.\n\nParts of the film were shot at Glen Canyon in Utah as well as Los Angeles and Canoga Park, California and the Grand Canyon in Arizona.\n\nThe footage of the Los Angeles Lakers game in the film was shot before anybody knew Lakers guard Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson was HIV+. Rita Kempley, in her film review in \"The Washington Post\", pointed to this scene as proof that \"... the filmmaker and his team ha[d] truly caught society on the verge.\"\n\nThe character Davis is based on action film producer Joel Silver.\n\n\"Grand Canyon: Music From the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" was released in 1992 on Milan Records.\n\n\n\"Grand Canyon\" received generally positive reviews from critics; it has a 7/10 \"fresh\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes and a critical rating of 76% based on 34 reviews.

It's the sort of movie that says: Life is worth living. After a couple of hours spent with characters this enjoyable, the message — in all its forthright sentimentality — feels earned.\"\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, and wrote, \"In a time when our cities are wounded, movies like \"Grand Canyon\" can help to heal.\" Ebert's television reviewing partner Gene Siskel also loved the film, with Ebert placing it at the #4 and Siskel at #6 on their 1991 top ten lists.\n\nThe film won the Golden Bear for Best Film at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival. The screenplay was nominated for the Oscar (as Best Original Screenplay), the Golden Globe and the Writers Guild of America.\n\n\"Grand Canyon\" was considered a minor failure at the box office, taking in $40.9 million, and did not reap notable profits until it was released on video.\n\nPhil Collins' 1993 song \"Both Sides of the Story\" references the scene from \"Grand Canyon\" where the young mugger tells Simon (played by Danny Glover) that he carries a gun to make sure people respect (and fear) him.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5583056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5583056", "title": "Hazel Massery", "text": "Hazel Massery\n\nHazel Bryan Massery (born ) was a student at Little Rock Central High School during the Civil Rights Movement. She was depicted in an iconic photograph that showed her shouting at Elizabeth Eckford, one of the Little Rock Nine, during the school integration crisis. In her later life, she sought to make amends for her behaviour, briefly becoming friends with Eckford.\nOn September 4th, 1957, nine African-American students entered Little Rock Central High School as the school's first black students, including Elizabeth Eckford. On her way to the school, a group of white teenage girls followed Eckford, chanting \"Two, four, six, eight! We don't want to integrate!\" One of these girls was Hazel Bryan. Benjamin Fine of \"The New York Times\" later described her as \"screaming, just hysterical, just like one of these Elvis Presley hysterical deals, where these kids are fainting with hysteria.\" Bryan is also credited as shouting, \"Go home, nigger! Go back to Africa!\"\n\nAfter the photo became public, Hazel started to receive \"critical\" mail, all from the north. Author David Margolick wrote that while Hazel only found the criticism \"surprising\", \"Hazel's parents, though, found her sudden notoriety sufficiently alarming to pull her out of the school.\"\n\nBryan left her new school when she was 17, married Antoine Massery and began a family. After that, her attitude toward Martin Luther King and the concept of desegregation changed. \"Hazel Bryan Massery was curious, and reflective... One day, she realized, her children would learn that the snarling girl in their history books was their mother. She realized she had an account to settle.\"\n\nIn 1963, having changed her mind on integration and feeling guilt for her treatment of Eckford, Bryan contacted Eckford to apologize. They went their separate ways after this first meeting, and Eckford did not name the girl in the picture when asked about it by reporters.\n\nDuring the time after Little Rock, Hazel had become increasingly political, branching out into peace activism and social work. David Margolick discovered, \"She taught mothering skills to unmarried black women, and took underprivileged black teenagers on field trips. She frequented the black history section at the local Barnes & Noble, buying books by Cornel West and Shelby Steele and the companion volume to \"Eyes on the Prize\".\"\n\nBryan hoped her reputation could be gained back, but this did not happen until the 40th anniversary of Central’s desegregation in 1997. Will Counts, the journalist who took the famous picture, arranged for Elizabeth and Hazel to meet again. The reunion provided an opportunity for acts of reconciliation, as noted in this editorial from the \"Arkansas Democrat-Gazette\" on the first day of 1998:\n\nDespite feeling awkward when they first met, Eckford and Bryan surprisingly became friends afterwards:\n\nSoon after, the friendship began to fray. In 1999, David Margolick travelled to Little Rock and arranged to meet Elizabeth and Hazel. According to Hazel Bryan, she said, \"I think she still… at times we have a little… well, the honeymoon is over and now we're getting to take out the garbage.\" As Eckford began to believe Bryan \"wanted me to be cured and be over it and for this not to go on... She wanted me to be less uncomfortable so that she wouldn't feel responsible anymore.\" The other eight of the Little Rock Nine didn't want this friendship to last any longer. The friendship quietly dissolved in 1999, when Elizabeth Eckford wrote \"True reconciliation can occur only when we honestly acknowledge our painful, but shared, past\" on the brick of Central High. This message affected their friendship. The principal of Central High School stated \"I just had hoped that I could show this picture and say, 'This happened, and that happened, and now…' and there is no 'now'.\" She added, \"And that makes me sad. It makes me sad for them, it makes me sad for the future students at our school, and for the history books, because I'd like a happy ending. And we don't have that.\"\n\n"}

It has been named a historic site because of its well-preserved architecture. Besides serving as a theater, the opera house has functioned as the community's village hall, its fire station, its post office, and its library.\n\nEstablished on 16 September 1823, Jamestown's first post office was conducted in conjunction with the postmaster's store. For many years, the location of the post office was the subject of a community dispute; each postmaster moved it away from the location used by the previous postmaster, and one postmaster moved its location weekly, prompting comparisons to circuit-riding Methodist preachers. A library was functioning in the community by 1870, although its use was restricted to students in the village schools. When the community was platted, its main intersection was that of Limestone and Xenia Streets: Limestone was the north-south road connecting Urbana, Ohio with Maysville, Kentucky, while Xenia was the east-west road from Xenia to Washington Court House. In Jamestown's early years, the southeastern corner of the intersection was occupied by a tavern that had been replaced with a store by the early 1880s. On this corner of the intersection, the Opera House was built in 1889. It was not originally built as a post office, but the office was moved to the Opera House after the size of the previous post office was discovered to be insufficient for Rural Free Delivery regulations. It operated in this rôle until a purpose-built post office was constructed in 1902.\n\nThe Opera House is a Romanesque Revival structure designed by John W. McLean and the firm of Matthew Moorman. Its brick walls rest on a foundation of limestone and are covered with a combination shingle-and-fiberglass roof. When it was built, the ordinance for its construction provided that it be used only for government offices, causing problems when it began to be used for postal purposes. Besides the offices for Jamestown's village government and for the officials of Silvercreek Township, the opera house was built with a substantial auditorium with a stage, as well as storage for stage equipment. It remained in its designed uses for less than half a century.\n\nIn 2007, the Jamestown Opera House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its place in local history. At the time, it was a work in progress, rather than being actively used for a specific purpose. It's one of two Greene County opera houses on the Register, along with the Cedarville Opera House in Cedarville. Using more approximately $225,000 supplied by the state government in the late 2000s in two separate grants, workers installed new windows, improved the electrical and HVAC systems, and restored the exterior walls. Another grant of $50,000 was used to repaint and restore the auditorium. The renovation project concluded in 2010.\n\n"}

Despite the name, the series covers important sources for the history of many countries besides Germany, since the Society for the Publication of Sources on Germanic Affairs of the Middle Ages has included documents from many other areas subjected to the influence of Germanic tribes or rulers (Britain, Czech lands, Poland, Austria, France, Low Countries, Italy, Spain, etc.). The editor from 1826 until 1874 was Georg Heinrich Pertz (1795–1876); in 1875 he was succeeded by Georg Waitz (1813-1886) .\n\nThe MGH was founded in Hanover as a private text publication society by the Prussian reformer Heinrich Friedrich Karl Freiherr vom Stein in 1819. The first volume appeared in 1826. The editor from 1826 until 1874 was Georg Heinrich Pertz, who was succeeded by Georg Waitz. Many eminent medievalists from Germany and, eventually, other countries, joined in the project of searching out and comparing manuscripts and producing scholarly editions. The motto chosen, \"Sanctus amor patriae dat animum\" (\"Holy love for the fatherland gives the spirit\") is explained as linking Romantic nationalism with professional scholarship. In 1875, the MGH was established as a more formal institution with headquarters in Berlin. \n\nIn 1935, the organization was taken over by the state and renamed the \"Reichsinstitut für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde\" (National Institute for Older German History). This was abolished in 1945, at the end of World War II. \n\nHowever, the institute was subsequently revived under its original name with the support of German institutions and the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The Monumenta Germaniae Historica Institute has been located in Munich since 1949 and possesses a large specialized library on the medieval history of Germany and Europe, including Church history, along with 130,000 monographs and approximately 150,000 dependent writings. It moved into its current premises in the building of the Bavarian State Library in 1967.\n\nThe project, a major effort of historical scholarship, continues in the 21st century. In 2004 the MGH, with the support of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, made all of its publications in print for more than five years available online, in photo-digital reproduction, via a link on the MGH homepage.\n\nThe series falls into five main divisions, \"Antiquitates\", \"Diplomata\", \"Epistolae\", \"Leges\" and \"Scriptores\", with an additional smaller division of \"Necrologia\". Many subsidiary series have also been established, including a series of more compact volumes for school use (\"Scriptores in usum scholarum\") and special studies (\"MGH Schriften\").\n\n\n\n"}

The work was republished by Columbia University Press in 1941, but failed to attract much attention. In 1955, the Liberal Arts Press intended to republish it in a volume also containing \"On Liberty\", but decided against doing so in view of the doubts surrounding its authorship raised by the Mill scholar J.C. Rees. He then set out the full case against attributing the work to Mill in his 1956 work \"Mill and His Early Critics\".\n\nRees's explanation for how the manuscript ended up among Mill's possessions is summarised by J.P. Scanlan:\n\nIn September, 1862, Mill wrote a letter from Avignon to a certain E.R. Edger, acknowledging receipt of a manuscript entitled \"Social Freedom.\" Apparently Edger hoped to elicit from Mill an appraisal of his capacity for philosophical inquiry, and had sent the manuscript as a sample of his work. Mill replies politely and with his usual care that he finds many signs of competence in the work - mostly, however, in the form of \"promise rather than performance\" - and he exhorts Edger to continue thinking and writing, though not \"to the neglect of other modes of gaining a subsistence.\" Concerining Edger's views Mill says only that, if he were to comment in detail, he \"should have much to say against several of your positions, and especially against your definition of liberty.\"\n\nThe letter is included in Mill's \"Collected Works\" where Edger is identified as \"probably Ebenezer R. Edger, associate of G.J. Holyoake in the promoting of the co-operative movement, writer for \"The Secular World\" and author of tracts on co-operation.\" Holyoake briefly mentions Edger in \"The History of Co-operation\":\n\n\"Ten years later my colleague, Mr E. R. Edger, visited Mr. Crisell, the manager of the farm whom the Rev. Mr. Robinson had found to be \"manly, open, and ingenious appearance,\" beyond what he expected of one belonging to the \"depressed\" class. Mr. Edger sent me this report:-\n\n\"I paid a visit to Assington, and had a conversation with the manager, Mr. Crisell (pronounced with i long, 'Cry-sell'). I can feel no enthusiasm at all about the Assington Farm. There seems no 'co-operation' in the right sense of the term, but only \"bounty\" of the squire towards poor neighbours.\n\n(1) It is limited to inhabitants of the parish.\n(2) Each member can hold only one share.\n(3) Members have no voice in the management.\n(4) Wages to workmen same as usual.\n(5) No special inducement offered to the workmen to become shareholders. The manager remarked that they did not care particularly to employ the members; this seems to me very significant.\nIt has been in existence forty-one years, so it will take a long time to renovate society that way. Remember, I only give my impressions.\"\nAn E.R. Edger is also listed in The British Medical Journal on the 24th of April 1869 as having passed a primary examination in anatomy and physiology at the Royal College of Surgeons of England.\n\n"}

While indigenous artists embrace contemporary Western art media, their arts also include pre-Columbian art forms. Indian art of aboriginal origin includes ceramics, baskets, weaving and threading, feather art and leather work. Indian art of a hybrid nature includes the embroideries, lace, woodcarving and different metal products. Paraguay is particularly known for its indigenous featherwork and basket weaving.\n\nThe handmade products of Paraguay are of a great variety and comprise ceramic articles, as well as embroideries and sewn articles, as well as wood, baskets, leather work and silver work. Pre-Columbian ceramics made in the Paraguayan territory were rustic and made from terracotta clay. They were painted in red, and occasionally in black and white. The clay used to be worked by hand. Some tribes incised their pottery with decorations before firing.\n\nThe Spanish, especially the Jesuits, influenced the technical level of production and the finishing of the native ceramics. These had been characterized by extreme simplicity and production of functional goods. The Jesuits taught the Indian population in the missions.\n\nCeramic products produced today by some Indian groups include jars, flower vases, and some without specific shapes, as well as water vases. Among those, the pottery most widely sold today due to its beauty and quality comes from Tobaty and Ita.\n\nBaskets are woven from the fibers of canes. Paraguayan Indians weave open baskets, baskets with handles, hand fans, shades, place mats, and especially \"piri\", the typical Paraguayan hat of the country men. Leather products, such as bags, hats, sacks, etc. have their main centers in Limpio and Luque, where also centers for production of beautiful baskets. Materials for wickerwork include indigenous bromeliads including tacuarembó and caraguatá, as well as pindo palm leaves.\n\nThe rich Indian basket production of Paraguay is dividing by plantations. For example, in some communities where the main crop is cassava, baskets are solid with great storage capacity. The \"ajaka mbya\" basket is an average of 35 centimeters diameter with rigid supports that can to hold the heavy weight of the cassavas.\n\nThe \"ajak\" is a basket made by weaving \"tacuarembo\" and dark \"guembepi\", making braided figures as well as geometric ones, in accordance with the Guaraní concept of beauty. The baskets associated with the production of corn are smaller and lighter and are constructed from pindo palm tree leaves.\n\nCeramics are an ancient art form in Paraguay, and ancient ceramics have been preserved through the centuries. Ceramics range from the utilitarian—cooking vessels, water jugs—to the sacred, such as funerary urns.\n\nA precolumbian art form, featherwork provides distinctive personal adornment. Brilliantly colored feathers are fashioned into anklets, bracelets, collars, headdresses, and even entire cloaks. Guaraní medicine men used to wear full feather cloaks. The Guaraní create feather headdresses called \"jeguaka\" worn during ceremonial occasions.\n\nIndian embroidery, weaving, and other textile art are an important source of income for the domestic economy. Before the arrival of the Spanish, the Indians used a horizontal piece of material to make hammocks with cotton threads, as well as the baskets and bags to transport food and nets for fishing and hunting.\n\nLater on they also knitted ponchos and other clothing items. As with ceramics, the Jesuits also introduced new techniques in this area, using the vertical frame to make the threads. Tribal artisans began producing sheets, towels, blankets, table clothes and other articles, as well as the special hammocks, which were knitted and still are with cotton threads and ornaments on the sides.\n\nNew technical resources brought by the Spanish inspired the typical cotton dresses, the ones called \"ao poi\", made with a fine thread, and the \"povyi\", a little wider thread weaving, as well as linen, and the beautiful \"ñanduti\", which means \"spider web\" in Guaraní language and consists of fine embroidery, with which table clothes, curtains, blouses and more are made.\n\nThe most coveted textiles are the Ñandutí embroideries made in the cities of Guarambaré and Itauguá. Woven ponchos, known for their beauty and quality, are made by the ethnic groups Lengua, Maskoy, Nivaclé, and Wichí from the Gran Chaco. They use sheep wool tinted in red and the ones called of 60 lists, made in Pirayú and Yataity, in the Guairá Department.\n\nAncient indigenous peoples of Paraguay carved petroglyphs into stone, particularly in the hills of Amambay Department.\n\nWood is carved into ceremonial masks, smoking pipes, chairs known as \"apyká\", and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic effigies. Gourds are also carves with images.\n\nThe Chamacoco ethnic group, from the Alto Paraguay Department, used dresses during their annual ritual called \"Debylyby.\" These are knitted of special fibers. Associated masks are carved from the karaguata tree and adorned with feathers from Chaco birds.\n\nThe Chamacocos used a \"pupo\", a protective vest made of karaguata. The \"pupo\" is knitted when the fibers are wet; these become rigid when dry and can serve as armor. They protected the wearer from the arrows of the enemies.\n\nThe weaving of Karaguata is an important element of the Indian art. It is an expression of the Indian people of the Gran Chaco. The bags of Karaguata are some of the most common applications of fiber twining. Collector's bags are mainly used by women, who carry them on their backs and have a form of a large half moon. Hunting bags are smaller, rectangular, carried by men on their shoulders.\n\nThe Pai Tavytera from Eastern Paraguay and Brazil are known for their necklaces made from carved wood and colorful seeds of different fruits. They use \"urucú\", a red dye made from \"Bixa orellana\" for body painting. Personal adornment is made from feathers, such as those of the toucan, and cotton. Labrets are made from resin. Men typically weave baskets, while women make ceramics. They are also being consulted in interpreting ancient rock art in Amambay.\n\nThe Toba tribe makes textiles from colorful wool threads, as well as the traditional bags, \"piri\" hats and carandilla leaf baskets.\nThe Mbayá Indians have a special ability in making baskets of natural \"tacuara\", that are decorated with drawings of \"Guembepi\" and animals of the zone, as well as their necklaces and wood carving.\n\nThe \"ayoreos bagas\" are one of the coveted Indian handiwork. These bags are made with karaguata fibers and exemplify rustic Indian beauty in its conception. The adherence to traditional aesthetics makes them extremely attractive. The Ayoreo also make dishes and spoons of Palo Santo wood and feather art.\n\nThe members of the Maka tribe are excellent weavers. Their traditional blankets, belts, and other elements are knitted with colorful threads.\n\nAva Guaraní are highly skilled at making baskets and hammocks. They use karaguata fibers, as well as guembepi for baskets that represent a novelty in the Indian work of the country.\n\nThe art produced by these two ways of living, nomadic and sedentary, reflect the difference of each one. The communities based in the recollection system are nomads. Therefore, their lifestyle allows for a more flexible and open culture, with many adaptations. In the other extreme, the Guaraní agricultural society is very attached to the land and its natural cycles, and naturally presents a conservative tendency, which can be closed to innovations. They distinguish their own from the other's property and have ongoing issues about the need to absorb or reject the foreign influences.\n\nDespite the differences in these societies and the special characteristics of each one, scholars say that it is possible to establish some shared elements in all Indian communities who live or have lived in Paraguay. Indian art – through its symbols and the free exercise of tribal languages – is one of the most important manifestations of indigenous culture in Paraguay.\n\nBoth the collectors and the agricultural societies have as a social nucleus, a mythical body-ritual, from where they can articulate and develop political power, in the judicial order, free time, beauty, and religion.\n\nThe mythical axis mundi-ritual, in essence the Indian cosmology, is composed of communal ceremonies. These are the moments when the community, through songs, dances and rites, show their identity. Indian art finds its first fundamental origins in those ceremonies and in the human body–its principal support. Feathers use in ornamentation, tattoos, and body paintings in the case of the Chaco Indians and the feather art among the Guaraní constitute basic elements of the Indian art in Paraguay.\n\nA number of museums are dedicated to showcased indigenous Paraguayan art. These include the Guido Boggiani Museum in San Lorenzo and in Asunción, the Andrés Barbero Ethnographic Museum, the Museum of Indigenous Art, and the Museo del Barro (Museum of Mud).\n\n\n\n"}

Each reincarnation, he wakes up in a river of feces running beneath his Brooklyn Heights apartment. \n\nSimultaneously, Mailer's body is represented as three generations of American cars: a 1967 Chrysler Crown Imperial (referencing Barney's Cremaster 3), a 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am and finally a 2001 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. All three cars are transmogrified through modern industrial processing and recycling to symbolize the regeneration and reincarnation of Mailer.\n\nThrough this, the narrative also follows American car dealerships, drum and bugle corps, 'stomp teams', James Lee Byars' piece \"The Death of James Lee Byars\", Los Angeles culture, the Brooklyn Navy Yard and alchemy.\n"}
{"id": "13567507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13567507", "title": "Saxon Shore", "text": "Saxon Shore\n\nThe Saxon Shore () was a military command of the late Roman Empire, consisting of a series of fortifications on both sides of the English Channel. It was established in the late 3rd century and was led by the \"Count of the Saxon Shore\". In the late 4th century, his functions were limited to Britain, while the fortifications in Gaul were established as separate commands. Several Saxon Shore forts survive in east and south-east England.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 3rd century, the Roman Empire faced a grave crisis. Internally, it was weakened by civil wars, the violent succession of brief emperors, and secession in the provinces, while externally it faced a new wave of attacks by \"barbarian\" tribes. Most of Britain had been part of the empire since the mid-1st century. It was protected from raids in the north by the Hadrianic and Antonine Walls, while a fleet of some size was also available.\n\nHowever, as the frontiers came under increasing external pressure, fortifications were built throughout the Empire in order to protect cities and guard strategically important locations. It is in this context that the forts of the Saxon Shore were constructed. Already in the 230s, under Severus Alexander, several units had been withdrawn from the northern frontier and garrisoned at locations in the south, and had built new forts at Brancaster, Caister-on-Sea and Reculver. Dover was already fortified in the early 2nd century, and the other forts in this group were constructed in the period between the 270s and 290s.\n\nThe only contemporary reference we possess that mentions the name \"Saxon Shore\" comes in the late 4th century \"Notitia Dignitatum\", which lists its commander, the \"Comes Litoris Saxonici per Britanniam\" (\"Count of the Saxon Shore in Britain\"), and gives the names of the sites under his command and their respective complements of military personnel. However, due to the absence of further evidence, theories have varied between scholars as to the exact meaning of the name, and also the nature and purpose of the chain of forts it refers to.\n\nTwo interpretations were put forward as to the meaning of the adjective \"Saxon\": either a shore \"attacked\" by Saxons, or a shore \"settled\" by Saxons. Some argue that the latter hypothesis, which is less valid, is supported by Eutropius, who states that during the 280s the sea along the coasts of Belgica and Armorica was \"infested with Franks and Saxons\", and that this was why Carausius was first put in charge of the fleet there. However, Eutropius refers to Franks and Saxons as seaborne invaders. It also receives at least partial support from archaeological finds, as artefacts of a Germanic style have been found in burials, while there is evidence of the presence of Saxons (mostly laeti Roman army recruits though) in some numbers in SE England and the northern coasts of Gaul around Boulogne-sur-Mer and Bayeux from the middle of the 5th century onwards. This, in turn, mirrors a well documented practice of deliberately settling Germanic tribes (Franks became foederati in 358 AD under Emperor Julian) to strengthen Roman defences.\n\nThe other interpretation, supported by Stephen Johnson, holds that the forts fulfilled a coastal defence role against seaborne invaders, mostly Saxons and Franks, and acted as bases for the naval units operating against them. This view is reinforced by the parallel chain of fortifications across the Channel on the northern coasts of Gaul, which complemented the British forts, suggesting a unified defensive system.\n\nOther scholars like John Cotterill however consider the threat posed by Germanic raiders, at least in the 3rd and early 4th centuries, to be exaggerated. They interpret the construction of the forts at Brancaster, Caister-on-Sea and Reculver in the early 3rd century and their location at the estuaries of navigable rivers as pointing to a different role: fortified points for transport and supply between Britain and Gaul, without any relation (at least at that time) to countering seaborne piracy. This view is supported by contemporary references to the supplying of the army of Julian by Caesar with grain from Britain during his campaign in Gaul in 359, and their use as secure landing places by Count Theodosius during the suppression of the Great Conspiracy a few years later.\n\nAnother theory, proposed by D.A. White, was that the extended system of large stone forts was disproportionate to any threat by seaborne Germanic raiders, and that it was actually conceived and constructed during the secession of Carausius and Allectus (the Carausian Revolt) in 289-296, and with an entirely different enemy in mind: they were to guard against an attempt at reconquest by the Empire. This view, although widely disputed, has found recent support from archaeological evidence at Pevensey, which dates the fort's construction to the early 290s.\n\nWhatever their original purpose, it is virtually certain that in the late 4th century the forts and their garrisons were employed in operations against Frankish and Saxon pirates. Britain was abandoned by Rome in 407, with Armorica following soon after. The forts on both sides continued to be inhabited in the following centuries, and in Britain in particular several continued in use well into the Anglo-Saxon period.\n\nThe nine forts mentioned in the \"Notitia Dignitatum\" for Britain are listed here, from north to south, with their garrisons.\n\nThere are a few other sites that clearly belonged to the system of the British branch of the Saxon Shore (the so-called \"Wash-Solent \"limes\"\"), although they are not included in the \"Notitia\", such as the forts at Walton Castle, Suffolk, which has by now sunk into the sea due to erosion, and at Caister-on-Sea. In the south, Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight and \"Clausentum\" (Bitterne, in modern Southampton) are also regarded as westward extensions of the fortification chain. Other sites likely connected to the Saxon Shore system are the sunken fort at Skegness, and the remains of possible signal stations at Thornham, Corton and Hadleigh.\n\nFurther north on the coast, the precautions took the form of central depots at \"Lindum\" (Lincoln) and Malton with roads radiating to coastal signal stations. When an alert was relayed to the base, troops could be dispatched along the road. Further up the coast in North Yorkshire, a series of coastal watchtowers (at Huntcliff, Filey, Ravenscar, Goldsborough, and Scarborough) was constructed, linking the southern defences to the northern military zone of the Wall. Similar coastal fortifications are also found in Wales, at Cardiff and Caer Gybi. The only fort in this style in the northern military zone is Lancaster, Lancashire, built sometime in the mid-late 3rd century replacing an earlier fort and extramural community, which may reflect the extent of coastal protection on the north-west coast from invading tribes from Ireland.\n\nThe \"Notitia\" also includes two separate commands for the northern coast of Gaul, both of which belonged to the Saxon Shore system. However, when the list was compiled, in , Britain had been abandoned by Roman forces. The first command controlled the shores of the province Belgica Secunda (roughly between the estuaries of the Scheldt and the Somme), under the \"dux Belgicae Secundae\" with headquarters at Portus Aepatiaci:\nAlthough not mentioned in the \"Notitia\", the port of \"Gesoriacum\" or \"Bononia\" (Boulogne-sur-Mer), which until 296 was the main base of the \"Classis Britannica\", would also have come under the \"dux Belgicae Secundae\".\n\nTo this group also belongs the Roman fort at Oudenburg.\n\nFurther west, under the \"dux tractus Armoricani et Nervicani\", were mainly the coasts of Armorica, nowadays Normandy and Brittany. The \"Notitia\" lists the following sites:\n\n\nIn addition, there are several other sites where a Roman military presence has been suggested. At Alderney, the fort known as \"The Nunnery\" is known to date to Roman times, and the settlement at Longy Common has been cited as evidence of a Roman military establishment, though the archaeological evidence there is, at best, scant.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

{"id": "11890889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11890889", "title": "Taste receptor", "text": "Taste receptor\n\nA taste receptor is a type of receptor which facilitates the sensation of taste. These receptors are of four types. When food or other substances enter the mouth, molecules interact with saliva and are bound to taste receptors in the oral cavity and other locations. Molecules which give a sensation of taste are considered \"sapid\".\n\nTaste receptors are divided into two families:\n\nCombinations of these receptors in dimers or other complexes contributes to different perceptions of taste.\n\nVisual, olfactive, “sapictive” (the perception of tastes), trigeminal (hot, cool), mechanical, all contribute to the perception of \"taste\". Of these, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) vanilloid receptors are responsible for the perception of heat from some molecules such as capsaicin, and a CMR1 receptor is responsible for the perception of cold from molecules such as menthol, eucalyptol, and icilin.\n\nThe gustatory system consists of taste receptor cells in taste buds. Taste buds, in turn, are contained in structures called papillae. There are three types of papillae involved in taste: fungiform papillae, foliate papillae, and circumvallate papillae. (The fourth type - filiform papillae do not contain taste buds). Beyond the papillae, taste receptors are also in the palate and early parts of the digestive system like the larynx and upper esophagus. There are three cranial nerves that innervate the tongue; the vagus nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, and the facial nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve and the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve innervate the TAS1R and TAS2R taste receptors.\n\nIn 2010, researchers found bitter receptors in lung tissue, which cause airways to relax when a bitter substance is encountered. They believe this mechanism is evolutionarily adaptive because it helps clear lung infections, but could also be exploited to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nTaste helps to identify toxins and maintain nutrition. Five basic tastes are recognized today: salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami. Salty and sour taste sensations are both detected through ion channels. Sweet, bitter, and umami tastes, however, are detected by way of G protein-coupled taste receptors.\n\nIn addition, some agents can function as , as miraculin or curculin for sweet or sterubin to .\n\nThe standard bitter, sweet, or umami taste receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor with seven transmembrane domains. Ligand binding at the taste receptors activate second messenger cascades to depolarize the taste cell. Gustducin is the most common taste Gα subunit, having a major role in TAS2R bitter taste reception. Gustducin is a homologue for transducin, a G-protein involved in vision transduction. Additionally, taste receptors share the use of the TRPM5 ion channel, as well as a phospholipase PLCβ2.\nThe TAS1R1+TAS1R3 heterodimer receptor functions as the savory receptor, responding to L-amino acid binding, especially L-glutamate. The umami taste is most frequently associated with the food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG) and can be enhanced through the binding of inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) molecules. TAS1R1+3 expressing cells are found mostly in the fungiform papillae at the tip and edges of the tongue and palate taste receptor cells in the roof of the mouth. These cells are shown to synapse upon the chorda tympani nerves to send their signals to the brain, although some activation of the glossopharyngeal nerve has been found.\n\nThe TAS1R2+TAS1R3 heterodimer receptor functions as the sweet receptor by binding to a wide variety of sugars and sugar substitutes. TAS1R2+3 expressing cells are found in circumvallate papillae and foliate papillae near the back of the tongue and palate taste receptor cells in the roof of the mouth. These cells are shown to synapse upon the chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves to send their signals to the brain. The TAS1R3 homodimer also functions as a sweet receptor in much the same way as TAS1R2+3 but has decreased sensitivity to sweet substances. Natural sugars are more easily detected by the TAS1R3 receptor than sugar substitutes. This may help explain why sugar and artificial sweeteners have different tastes.\n\nThe TAS2R proteins function as bitter taste receptors. There are 43 human \"TAS2R\" genes, each of which (excluding the five pseudogenes) lacks introns and codes for a GPCR protein. These proteins, as opposed to TAS1R proteins, have short extracellular domains and are located in circumvallate papillae, palate, foliate papillae, and epiglottis taste buds, with reduced expression in fungiform papillae. Though it is certain that multiple TAS2Rs are expressed in one taste receptor cell, it is still debated whether mammals can distinguish between the tastes of different bitter ligands. Some overlap must occur, however, as there are far more bitter compounds than there are TAS2R genes. Common bitter ligands include cycloheximide, denatonium, PROP (6-\"n\"-propyl-2-thiouracil), PTC (phenylthiocarbamide), and β-glucopyranosides.\n\nSignal transduction of bitter stimuli is accomplished via the α-subunit of gustducin. This G protein subunit activates a taste phosphodiesterase and decreases cyclic nucleotide levels. Further steps in the transduction pathway are still unknown. The βγ-subunit of gustducin also mediates taste by activating IP (inositol triphosphate) and DAG (diglyceride). These second messengers may open gated ion channels or may cause release of internal calcium. Though all TAS2Rs are located in gustducin-containing cells, knockout of gustducin does not completely abolish sensitivity to bitter compounds, suggesting a redundant mechanism for bitter tasting (unsurprising given that a bitter taste generally signals the presence of a toxin). One proposed mechanism for gustducin-independent bitter tasting is via ion channel interaction by specific bitter ligands, similar to the ion channel interaction which occurs in the tasting of sour and salty stimuli.\n\nOne of the best-researched TAS2R proteins is TAS2R38, which contributes to the tasting of both PROP and PTC. It is also the only taste receptor whose polymorphisms are shown to be responsible for differences in taste perception. Current studies are focused on determining other such taste phenotype-determining polymorphisms.\n\nHistorically it was thought that the sour taste was produced solely when free hydrogen ions (H) directly depolarised taste receptors. However, specific receptors for sour taste with other methods of action are now being proposed. HCN1 and HCN4 (HCN channels) were two such proposals; both of these receptors are cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. The two ion channels suggested to contribute to sour taste are ACCN1 and TASK-1.\n\nVarious receptors have also been proposed for salty tastes, along with the possible taste detection of lipids, complex carbohydrates, and water. Evidence for these receptors is, however, shaky at best, and is often unconvincing in mammal studies. For example, the proposed ENaC receptor for sodium detection can only be shown to contribute to sodium taste in \"Drosophilia\".\n\nAn enzyme connected to the sour receptor transmits information about carbonated water.\n\nA possible taste receptor for fat, CD36, has been identified. CD36 has been localized to the circumvallate and foliate papillae, which are present in taste buds, and research has shown that the CD36 receptor binds long chain fatty acids. Differences in the amount of CD36 expression in human subjects was associated with their ability to taste fats, creating a case for the receptor's relationship to fat tasting. Further research into the CD36 receptor could be useful in determining the existence of a true fat-tasting receptor.\n\nGPR120 and GPR40 have been implicated to respond to oral fat, and their absence leads to reduced fat preference and reduced neuronal response to orally administered fatty acids.\n\nTRPM5 has been shown to be involved in oral fat response and identified as a possible oral fat receptor, but recent evidence presents it as primarily a downstream actor.\n\nHuman bitter taste receptor genes are named TAS2R1 to TAS2R64, with many gaps due to non-existent genes, pseudogenes or proposed genes that have not been annotated to the most recent human genome assembly. Many bitter taste receptor genes also have confusing synonym names with several different gene names referring to the same gene. See table below for full list of human bitter taste receptor genes:\n\n"}
{"id": "148731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148731", "title": "The Cat in the Hat", "text": "The Cat in the Hat\n\nThe Cat in the Hat is a children's book written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and first published in 1957. The story centers on a tall anthropomorphic cat, who wears a red and white-striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Despite the repeated objections of the children's fish, the Cat shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process he and his companions, Thing One and Thing Two, wreck the house. The children and the fish become more and more alarmed until the Cat produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up and disappears just before the children's mother comes home.\n\nGeisel created the book in response to a debate in the United States about literacy in early childhood and the ineffectiveness of traditional primers such as those featuring Dick and Jane. Geisel was asked to write a more entertaining primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II and who was then director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin. However, because Geisel was already under contract with Random House, the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, and Random House published the trade edition, which was sold in bookstores.\n\nGeisel gave varying accounts of how he created \"The Cat in the Hat\", but in the version he told most often he was so frustrated with the word list from which he could choose words to write his story that he decided to scan the list and create a story based on the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were \"cat\" and \"hat\". The book was met with immediate critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised it as an exciting alternative to traditional primers. Three years after its debut, the book had already sold over a million copies, and in 2001 \"Publishers Weekly\" listed the book at number nine on its list of best-selling children's books of all time. The book's success led to the creation of Beginner Books, a publishing house centered on producing similar books for young children learning to read. In 1983, Geisel said, \"It is the book I'm proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the Dick and Jane primers.\" The book was adapted into a 1971 animated television special and a 2003 live-action film.\n\nThe story begins as a girl named Sally and her brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly followed by the arrival of the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat should leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes increasingly trickier, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.\n\nThe Cat brings in a big red box from outside, from which he releases two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures off the wall and picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started at the beginning of the story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, \"What would \"you\" do if your mother asked \"you\"?\"\n\nTheodor Geisel, writing as Dr. Seuss, created \"The Cat in the Hat\" partly in response to the May 24, 1954, \"Life\" magazine article by John Hersey titled \"Why Do Students Bog Down on First R? A Local Committee Sheds Light on a National Problem: Reading\". In the article, Hersey was critical of school primers like those featuring Dick and Jane:\n\nIn the classroom boys and girls are confronted with books that have insipid illustrations depicting the slicked-up lives of other children... All feature abnormally courteous, unnaturally clean boys and girls... In bookstores anyone can buy brighter, livelier books featuring strange and wonderful animals and children who behave naturally, i.e., sometimes misbehave... Given incentive from school boards, publishers could do as well with primers. \n\nAfter detailing many issues contributing to the dilemma connected with student reading levels, Hersey asked toward the end of the article:\n\nWhy should [school primers] not have pictures that widen rather than narrow the associative richness the children give to the words they illustrate—drawings like those of the wonderfully imaginative geniuses among children's illustrators, Tenniel, Howard Pyle, \"Dr. Seuss\", Walt Disney?\n\nThis article caught the attention of William Spaulding, who had met Geisel during the war and who was then the director of Houghton Mifflin's education division. Spaulding had also read the best-selling 1955 book \"Why Johnny Can't Read\" by Rudolf Flesch. Flesch, like Hersey, criticized primers as boring but also criticized them for teaching reading through word recognition rather than phonics. In 1955, Spaulding invited Geisel to dinner in Boston where he proposed that Geisel create a book \"for six- and seven-year-olds who had already mastered the basic mechanics of reading\". He reportedly challenged, \"Write me a story that first-graders can't put down!\"\n\nAt the back of \"Why Johnny Can't Read\", Flesch had included 72 lists of words that young children should be able to read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.\n\nGeisel gave varying accounts of how he conceived of \"The Cat in the Hat\". According to the story Geisel told most often, he was so frustrated with the word list that William Spaulding had given him that he finally decided to scan the list and create a story out of the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were \"cat\" and \"hat\". \nNear the end of his life, Geisel told his biographers, Judith and Neil Morgan, that he conceived the beginnings of the story while he was with Spaulding, in an elevator in the Houghton Mifflin offices in Boston. It was an old, shuddering elevator and was operated by a \"small, stooped woman wearing 'a leather half-glove and a secret smile'\". Anita Silvey, recounting a similar story, described the woman as \"a very elegant, very petite African-American woman named Annie Williams\". Geisel told Silvey that, when he sketched the Cat in the Hat, he thought of Williams and gave the character Williams' white gloves and \"sly, even foxy smile\".\nGeisel gave two conflicting, partly fictionalized accounts of the book's creation in two articles, \"How Orlo Got His Book\" in \"The New York Times Book Review\" and \"My Hassle with the First Grade Language\" in the \"Chicago Tribune\", both published on November 17, 1957. In \"My Hassle with the First Grade Language\", he wrote about his proposal to a \"distinguished schoolbook publisher\" to write a book for young children about \"scaling the peaks of Everest at 60 degrees below\". The publisher was intrigued but informed him that, because of the word list, \"you can't use the word \"scaling\". You can't use the word \"peaks\". You can't use \"Everest\". You can't use \"60\". You can't use \"degrees\". You can't...\" Geisel gave a similar account to Robert Cahn for an article in the July 6, 1957, edition of \"The Saturday Evening Post\". In \"My Hassle With the First Grade Language\", he also told a story of the \"three excruciatingly painful weeks\" in which he worked on a story about a King Cat and a Queen Cat. However, \"queen\" was not on the word list, nor did his first grade nephew, Norval, recognize it. So Geisel returned to the work but could then think only of words that started with the letter \"q\", which did not appear in any word on the list. He then had a similar fascination with the letter \"z\", which also did not appear in any word on the list. When he did finally finish the book and showed it to his nephew, Norval had already graduated from the first grade and was learning calculus. Philip Nel notes, in his dissection of the article, that Norval was Geisel's invention. Geisel's niece, Peggy Owens, did have a son, but he was only a one-year-old when the article was published.\n\nIn \"How Orlo Got His Book\", he described Orlo, a fictional, archetypal young child who was turned off of reading by the poor selection of simple reading material. To save Orlo the frustration, Geisel decided to write a book for children like Orlo but found the task \"not dissimilar to... being lost with a witch in a tunnel of love\". He tried to write a story called \"The Queen Zebra\" but found that both words did not appear on the list. In fact, like Geisel wrote in \"My Hassle with the First Grade Language\", the letters \"q\" and \"z\" did not appear on the list at all. He then tried to write a story about a bird, without using the word \"bird\" as it did not appear on the list. He decided to call it a \"wing thing\" instead but struggled as he discovered that it \"couldn't have \"legs\" or a \"beak\" or a \"tail\". Neither a \"left\" foot or a \"right\" foot.\" On his approach to writing \"The Cat in the Hat\" he wrote, \"The method I used is the same method you use when you sit down to make apple stroodle [sic] without stroodles.\"\n\nGeisel variously stated that the book took between nine and 18 months to create. Donald Pease notes that he worked on it primarily alone, unlike with previous books, which had been more collaborative efforts between Geisel and his wife, Helen. This marked a general trend in his work and life. As Robert L. Bernstein later said of that period, \"The more I saw of him, the more he liked being in that room and creating all by himself.\" Pease points to Helen's recovery from Guillain–Barré syndrome, which she was diagnosed with in 1954, as the marker for this change.\n\nGeisel agreed to write \"The Cat in the Hat\" at the request of William Spaulding of Houghton Mifflin; however, because Geisel was under contract with Random House, the head of Random House, Bennett Cerf, made a deal with Houghton Mifflin. Random House retained the rights to trade sales, which encompassed copies of the book sold at book stores, while Houghton Mifflin retained the education rights, which encompassed copies sold to schools.\n\nThe Houghton Mifflin edition was released in January or February 1957, and the Random House edition was released on March 1. The two editions featured different covers but were otherwise identical. The first edition can be identified by the \"200/200\" mark in the top right corner of the front dust jacket flap, signifying the $2.00 selling price. The price was reduced to $1.95 on later editions.\n\nAccording to Judith and Neil Morgan, the book sold well immediately. The trade edition initially sold an average of 12,000 copies a month, a figure which rose rapidly. Bullock's department store in Los Angeles, California, sold out of its first, 100-copy order of the book in a day and quickly reordered 250 more. The Morgans attribute these sales numbers to \"playground word-of-mouth\", asserting that children heard about the book from their friends and nagged their parents to buy it for them. However, Houghton Mifflin's school edition did not sell as well. As Geisel noted in Jonathan Cott's 1983 profile of him, \"Houghton Mifflin... had trouble selling it to the schools; there were a lot of Dick and Jane devotees, and my book was considered too fresh and irreverent. But Bennett Cerf at Random House had asked for trade rights, and it just took off in the bookstores.\" Geisel told the Morgans, \"Parents understood better than school people the necessity for this kind of reader.\"\n\nAfter three years in print, \"The Cat in the Hat\" had sold nearly one million copies. By then, the book had been translated into French, Chinese, Swedish, and Braille. In 2001, \"Publishers Weekly\" placed it at number nine on its list of the best-selling children's books of all time. As of 2007, more than 10 million copies of \"The Cat in the Hat\" have been printed, and it has been translated into more than 12 different languages, including Latin, under the title \"Cattus Petasatus\". In 2007, on the occasion of the book's fiftieth anniversary, Random House released \"The Annotated Cat: Under the Hats of Seuss and His Cats\", which includes both \"The Cat in the Hat\" and its sequel, with annotations and an introduction by Philip Nel.\n\nThe book was published to immediate critical acclaim. Some reviewers praised the book as an exciting way to learn to read, particularly compared to the primers that it supplanted. Ellen Lewis Buell, in her review for \"The New York Times Book Review\", noted the book's heavy use of one-syllable words and lively illustrations. She wrote, \"Beginning readers and parents who have been helping them through the dreary activities of Dick and Jane and other primer characters are due for a happy surprise.\" Helen Adams Masten of the \"Saturday Review\" called the book Geisel's \"tour de force\" and wrote, \"Parents and teachers will bless Mr. Geisel for this amusing reader with its ridiculous and lively drawings, for their children are going to have the exciting experience of learning that they \"can\" read after all.\" Polly Goodwin of the \"Chicago Sunday Tribune\" predicted that \"The Cat in the Hat\" would cause seven- and eight-year-olds to \"look with distinct distaste on the drab adventures of standard primer characters\".\n\nBoth Helen E. Walker of \"Library Journal\" and Emily Maxwell of \"The New Yorker\" felt that the book would appeal to older children as well as to its target audience of first- and second-graders. The reviewer for \"The Bookmark\" concurred, writing, \"Recommended enthusiastically as a picture book as well as a reader\". In contrast, Heloise P. Mailloux wrote in \"The Horn Book Magazine\", \"This is a fine book for remedial purposes, but self-conscious children often refuse material if its seems meant for younger children.\" She felt that the book's limited vocabulary kept it from reaching \"the absurd excellence of early Seuss books\".\n\nBased on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named \"The Cat in the Hat\" one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\". In 2012 it was ranked number 36 among the \"Top 100 Picture Books\" in a survey published by \"School Library Journal\" – the third of five Dr. Seuss books on the list. It was awarded the Early Readers BILBY Award in 2004 and 2012.\n\nThe book's fiftieth anniversary in 2007 prompted a reevaluation of the book from some critics. Yvonne Coppard, reviewing the fiftieth anniversary edition in \"Carousel\" magazine, wondered if the popularity of the Cat and his \"delicious naughty behavior\" will endure another fifty years. Coppard wrote, \"The innocent ignorance of bygone days has given way to an all-embracing, almost paranoid awareness of child protection issues. And here we have the mysterious stranger who comes in, uninvited, while your mother is out.\"\n\nPhilip Nel places the book's title character in the tradition of con artists in American art, including the title characters from Meredith Willson's \"The Music Man\" and L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". Nel also contends that Geisel identified with the Cat, pointing to a self portrait of Geisel in which he appears as the Cat, which was published alongside a profile about him in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" on July 6, 1957. Michael K. Frith, who worked as Geisel's editor, concurs, arguing that \"The Cat in the Hat and Ted Geisel were inseparable and the same. I think there's no question about it. This is someone who delighted in the chaos of life, who delighted in the seeming insanity of the world around him.\" Ruth MacDonald asserts that the Cat's primary goal in the book is to create fun for the children. The Cat calls it \"fun that is funny\", which MacDonald distinguishes from the ordinary, serious fun that parents subject their children to. In an article titled \"Was the Cat in the Hat Black?\", Philip Nel draws connections between the Cat and stereotyped depictions of African-Americans, including minstrel shows, Geisel's own minstrel-inspired cartoons from early in his career, and the use of the term \"cat\" to refer to jazz musicians. According to Nel, \"Even as [Geisel] wrote books designed to challenge prejudice, he never fully shed the cultural assumptions he grew up with, and was likely unaware of the ways in which his visual imagination replicated the racial ideologies he consciously sought to reject.\"\nGeisel once called the fish \"my version of Cotton Mather\", the Puritan moralist who advised the prosecutors during the Salem witch trials. Betty Mensch and Alan Freeman support this view, writing, \"Drawing on old Christian symbolism (the fish was an ancient sign of Christianity) Dr. Seuss portrays the fish as a kind of ever-nagging superego, the embodiment of utterly conventionalized morality.\" Philip Nel notes that other critics have also compared the fish to the superego. Anna Quindlen called the Cat \"pure id\" and marked the children, as mediators between the Cat and the fish, as the ego. Mensch and Freeman, however, argue that the Cat shows elements of both id and ego.\n\nIn her analysis of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents the voice of the children's absent mother. Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children are hesitant to tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them \"that something did go on but that silence is the better part of valor in this case\". Alison Lurie agrees, writing, \"there is a strong suggestion that they might not tell her.\" She argues that, in the Cat's destruction of the house, \"the kids—and not only those in the story, but those who read it—have vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences.\" For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, \"\"The Cat in the Hat\" is a revolt against authority, but it's ameliorated by the fact that the Cat cleans up everything at the end. It's revolutionary in that it goes as far as Kerensky and then stops. It doesn't go quite as far as Lenin.\"\n\nDonald Pease notes that \"The Cat in the Hat\" shares some structural similarities with other Dr. Seuss books. Like earlier books, \"The Cat in the Hat\" starts with \"a child's feeling of discontent with his mundane circumstances\" which is soon enhanced by make believe. The book starts in a factual, realistic world, which crosses over into the world of make believe with the loud bump that heralds the arrival of the Cat. However, this is the first Dr. Seuss book in which the fantasy characters, i.e. the Cat and his companions, are not products of the children's imagination. It also differs from previous books in that Sally and her brother actively participate in the fantasy world; they also have a changed opinion of the Cat and his world by the story's end.\n\nRuth MacDonald asserts, \"\"The Cat in the Hat\" is the book that made Dr. Seuss famous. Without \"The Cat\", Seuss would have remained a minor light in the history of children's literature.\" Donald Pease concurs, writing, \"\"The Cat in the Hat\" is the classic in the archive of Dr. Seuss stories for which it serves as a cornerstone and a linchpin. Before writing it Geisel was better known for the 'Quick, Henry, the Flit!' ad campaign than for his nine children's books.\" The publication and popularity of the book thrust Geisel into the center of the United States literacy debate, what Pease called \"the most important academic controversy\" of the Cold War era. Academic Louis Menand contends that \"\"The Cat in the Hat\" transformed the nature of primary education and the nature of children's books. It not only stood for the idea that reading ought to be taught by phonics; it also stood for the idea that language skills—and many other subjects—ought to be taught through illustrated storybooks, rather than primers and textbooks.\" In 1983, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, \"It is the book I'm proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the \"Dick and Jane\" primers.\"\n\nThe book led directly to the creation of Beginner Books, a publishing house centered on producing books like \"The Cat in the Hat\" for beginning readers. According to Judith and Neil Morgan, when the book caught the attention of Phyllis Cerf, the wife of Geisel's publisher, Bennett Cerf, she arranged for a meeting with Geisel, where the two agreed to create Beginner Books. Geisel became the president and editor, and the Cat in the Hat served as their mascot. Geisel's wife, Helen, was made third partner. Random House served as distributor until 1960, when Random House purchased Beginner Books. Geisel wrote multiple books for the series, including \"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back\" (1958), \"Green Eggs and Ham\" (1960), \"Hop on Pop\" (1963), and \"Fox in Socks\" (1965). He initially used word lists of limited vocabularies to create these books, as he had with \"The Cat in the Hat\", but moved away from the lists as he came to believe \"that a child could learn any amount of words if fed them slowly and if the books were amply illustrated\". Other authors also contributed notable books to the series, including \"A Fly Went By\" (1958), \"Sam and the Firefly\" (1958), \"Go, Dog. Go!\" (1961), and \"The Big Honey Hunt\" (1962).\n\nThe book, or elements of it, has been mentioned multiple times in United States politics. The image of the Cat balancing many objects on his body while in turn balancing himself on a ball has been included in political cartoons and articles. Political caricaturists have portrayed both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in this way. In 2004, \"MAD\" magazine published \"The Strange Similarities Between the Bush Administration and the World of Dr. Seuss\", an article which matched quotes from White House officials to excerpts taken from Dr. Seuss books, and in which George W. Bush's State of the Union promises were contrasted with the Cat vowing (in part), \"I can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake! I can hold up these books! And the fish on a rake!\" In 2007, during the 110th Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid compared the impasse over a bill to reform immigration with the mess created by the Cat. He read lines of the book from the Senate floor. He then carried forward his analogy hoping the impasse would be straightened out for \"If you go back and read Dr. Seuss, the cat manages to clean up the mess.\" In 1999, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp featuring the Cat in the Hat.\n\n\"The Cat in the Hat\"s popularity also led to increased popularity and exposure for Geisel's previous children's books. For example, 1940's \"Horton Hatches the Egg\" had sold 5,801 copies in its opening year and 1,645 the following year. In 1958, the year after the publication of \"The Cat in the Hat\", 27,643 copies of \"Horton\" were sold, and by 1960 the book had sold a total of over 200,000 copies.\n\n\"The Cat in the Hat\" has been adapted for various media, including theater, television, film, educational software and VHS/DVD.\n\nThe animated musical TV special premiered in 1971 and starred Allan Sherman as the Cat. The Cat also stars in the 1982 television film \"The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat\" and the 2010 flash-animated television series \"The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!\".\n\nIn 2003, a live-action film adaptation was released, starring Mike Myers as the Cat, Spencer Breslin as Conrad, and Dakota Fanning as Sally. Boxoffice.com reports that the film grossed $133,960,541 worldwide on an estimated $109 million budget. \n\nIn 2012, following the financial success of \"The Lorax\", the animated film adaptation of the Dr. Seuss book of the same name, Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment announced plans to produce a CGI adaptation of the book. Rob Lieber was set to write the script, with Chris Meledandri as producer, and Audrey Geisel as the executive producer. However, the project never came into fruition.\nOn January 24, 2018, it was announced that Warner Animation Group was in development of an animated \"Cat in the Hat\" film as part of a creative partnership with Seuss Enterprises.\n\nIn 2009, the Royal National Theatre created a stage version of the book, adapted and directed by Katie Mitchell. \"Seussical\", a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the Cat in the Hat as narrator. The musical received weak reviews when it opened, in November 2001, but eventually became a staple in regional and school theaters. \n\nA ride at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure park in Orlando, Florida, has a \"Cat in the Hat\" theme.\n\nIn 1997, The book was made into a Living Books adaption for the PC and then, there were similar differences to reflect the new media such as Conrad sings his lines at the subtitles of the story as the narrator in the rainy day.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2652749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2652749", "title": "The Fighting Temeraire", "text": "The Fighting Temeraire\n\nThe Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up, 1838 is an oil painting by the English artist Joseph Mallord William Turner. It was painted in 1838 and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839. The 98-gun ship HMS \"Temeraire\" was one of the last second-rate ships of the line to have played a distinguished role in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The painting depicts HMS \"Temeraire\" being towed by a paddle-wheel steam tug towards its final berth in Rotherhithe in south-east London in 1838 to be broken up for scrap. The painting hangs in the National Gallery, London, having been bequeathed to the nation by the artist in 1851. In 2005 it was voted the nation's favourite painting in a poll organised by BBC Radio 4's \"Today\" programme.\n\nWhen Turner came to paint this picture he was at the height of his career, having exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, for 40 years. He was renowned for his highly atmospheric paintings in which he explored the subjects of the weather, the sea and the effects of light. He spent much of his life near the River Thames and did many paintings of ships and waterside scenes, both in watercolour and in oils. Turner frequently made small sketches and then worked them into finished paintings in the studio.\n\nHe may or may not have witnessed the actual towing of \"Temeraire\" and used considerable licence in the painting which had a symbolic meaning for him, that his first audience immediately appreciated. Turner had been eighteen years old when Britain entered the Napoleonic Wars and \"had a strong patriotic streak\". The \"Temeraire\" was a very well-known ship from her heroic performance at Trafalgar, and her sale by the Admiralty had attracted substantial press coverage, which was probably what brought the subject to his attention.\n\nThe composition of this painting is unusual in that the most significant object, the old warship, is positioned well to the left of the painting, where it rises in stately splendour and almost ghostlike colours against a triangle of blue sky and rising mist that throws it into relief. The beauty of the old ship is in stark contrast to the dirty blackened tugboat with its tall smokestack, which scurries across the still surface of the river.\n\nTurner has used the triangle of blue to frame a second triangle of masted ships, which progressively decrease in size as they become more distant. \"Temeraire\" and tugboat have passed a small river craft with its gaff rigged sail barely catching a breeze. Beyond this a square-rigger drifts, with every bit of sail extended. Another small craft shows as a patch of white farther down the river. In the far distance, beyond the second tugboat which makes its way towards them, a three-masted ship rides at anchor. The becalmed sailing vessels show the obsolescence of sail.\n\nOn the opposite side of the painting to \"Temeraire\", and exactly the same distance from the frame as the ship's main mast, the sun sets above the estuary, its rays extending into the clouds above it, and across the surface of the water. The flaming red of the clouds is reflected in the river. It exactly repeats the colour of the smoke which pours from the funnel of the tugboat. The sun setting symbolises the end of an epoch in the history of the British Royal Navy.\n\nBehind \"Temeraire\", a gleaming sliver of the waxing moon casts a silvery beam across the river, symbolising the commencement of the new, industrial era. The demise of heroic strength is the subject of the painting, and it has been suggested that the ship stands for the artist himself, with an accomplished and glorious past but now contemplating his mortality. Turner called the work his \"darling\", which may have been due to its beauty, or his identification with the subject.\n\nSir Henry Newbolt wrote later a ballad titled \"The Fighting Temeraire\", describing the same scene: \"And she's fading down the river, But in England's song for ever, She's the Fighting Téméraire.\"\n\nTurner took some artistic licence with the painting. The ship was known to her crew as \"Saucy\", rather than \"Fighting\" \"Temeraire\". Before being sold to the ship-breaker John Beatson, the ship had been lying at Sheerness Dockyard, and was then moved to his wharf at Rotherhithe. As shown in a \"prosaic drawing, made on the spot by a trained observer\" (William Beatson, the ship-breaker's brother) and turned into a lithograph, her masts and rigging were removed before her sale and journey to the breaker's yard. All of her cannon, anchors and assorted hardware had been removed and salvaged for the navy to use as spare parts. She was towed by two tugboats, not just one, and in the other direction (the sun sets in the west, while the Thames estuary is at the river's eastern end).\n\nWhen exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839 the painting was a considerable success, praised in various of the lengthy press reviews that the Summer Exhibitions then received as a \"grand image of the last days of one of Britain's bulwarks\" as \"The Spectator\" put it. The novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, reviewing for \"Fraser's Magazine\" \"in the form of mostly facetious letters\" supposedly by \"Michael Angelo Titmarsh Esq.\" abandoned his usual flippant tone when discussing \"as grand a picture as ever figured on the walls of any academy, or came from the easel of any painter\". Turner displayed the painting in 1839 accompanied by an altered excerpt from Thomas Campbell's poem \"Ye Mariners of England\", reading:\n\n<poem>\n</poem>\n\nTurner kept the painting in his studio, which also functioned as a showroom for buyers, until his death. In 1844 he lent it as part of his deal for reproductions to the print publisher J. Hogarth, who exhibited it at his premises, but about a year later wrote a draft note replying to another request saying that \"no consid[eratio]ns of money or favour can induce me to lend my Darling again...\". Hogarth's steel engraving by James Tibbits Willmore, who had often engraved Turners, was published in 1845 and was the first of many reproductions in various techniques. In about 1848 Turner refused an offer to buy the painting reputed to have been £5,000, followed by a \"blank cheque\", having determined to leave it to the nation, and already being very well-off.\n\nIt was evidently usually among the works on display in the studio, and is mentioned by several visitors. He intended to leave his paintings to the nation but the terms of his will were unclear and after his death in 1851 his will was contested by relatives, and several years of litigation were only ended in 1856, when this and a large body of other work entered the collection of the National Gallery. Most of the \"Turner Bequest\" was turned over to Tate Britain when that was established in 1897, but the \"Fighting Temeraire\" remained in the National Gallery. It was in the Tate Gallery (as it then was) from 1910 to 1914 and 1960 to 1961, and for six months in 1987 to mark the opening of the Clore Gallery there, which houses the rest of the Bequest. In 1947–48 it went on a European tour to Amsterdam, Bern, Paris, Brussels, Liège, ending at the Venice Biennale. In 1952 it was exhibited in Cape Town.\n\nThe picture remains in \"exceptionally good condition\", apart from slightly discoloured varnish, and seems never to have received conservation treatment beyond the removal of surface dirt in 1945 and a lining in 1963. X-ray images reveal that Turner seems to have used a canvas on which he had started another marine picture, with a large sail where the tugboat's above deck structures now are.\n\nThe painting is used in the 2012 James Bond film \"Skyfall\" to be symbolic of Bond's age and current standing within MI6:\n\nQ: \"Always makes me feel a little melancholy. Grand old war ship, being ignominiously hauled away for scrap... The inevitability of time, don't you think? What do you see?\"\n\nBond: \"A bloody big ship.\"\n\n\n"}

It is an easy walk from the convention center or Nationwide Arena district to the south. The Short North is often crowded on weekends, particularly during the monthly \"Gallery Hop\" and other local and downtown events.\n\nThe Short North has been described as \"colorful\", \"offbeat\", and \"trendy\". The district is heavily populated with art galleries, specialty shops, pubs, nightclubs, and coffee houses. Most of its tightly packed brick buildings date from at least the early 20th century, with traditional storefronts along High Street (often with brightly painted murals on their side walls), and old apartment buildings and rowhouses and newer condominium developments in the surrounding blocks. The city installed 17 lighted metal archways extending across High Street throughout the Short North, reminiscent of such arches present in the area in the early 1900s.\n\nThe area is also known to be a very gay- and lesbian-friendly neighborhood which contains numerous gay nightclubs and bars and hosts the annual Columbus gay pride parade\n\nThe name \"Short North\" traces its roots back to the vernacular used by police for the area during a period of decline, namely as the neighborhood that—from a suburban commuter's perspective—had fallen 'just short' of the central business district's north end—both physically and economically. A reputation for diversity and an artistic, Bohemian atmosphere has marked the Short North, with land prices and local rents rising steadily from the humble beginnings as a squatter’s neighborhood in the 1980s. Prior to this gentrification of the neighborhood which originated from artists, it had suffered prolonged decay and from latent, street-level crime and gang violence as Columbus affluent residents followed the economic bubble outward—into the suburbs—during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe 1980s saw the neighborhood's rebirth enter into full gear as galleries began to open up and started to flourish. As Maria Gallowy owner of pm gallery the oldest gallery in the Short North once put it \"It was one of those neighborhoods that artists love to move into because the possibilities are there.\" In 1984 two Short North area galleries —the now defunct Art Reach and the still thriving pm gallery— began opening new exhibits on the first Saturday of every month to help cross-promote their businesses and build a more unified community. This loose coordination later evolved into the Gallery Hop which is still held every first Saturday of the month. The Gallery Hop today features most businesses keeping their doors open late into the night, jam-packed streets, and sidewalks populated with street musicians and other performers.\n\nSince 1983, the Short North has also hosted the annual Doo Dah Parade, a parody of typical Fourth of July parades that includes politically slanted paraders and floats as well as absurdities such as the \"Marching Fidels,\" a band of Fidel Castro lookalikes. The parade starts in neighboring Victorian Village, at Goodale Park, and winds north to finish coming south down High Street.\n\nThe Short North also hosts HighBall Halloween, Masquerade on High, a fashion show and street parade that closes down High Street. In 2011, in its 4th year, HighBall Halloween gained notoriety as it accepted its first Expy award. HighBall Halloween has much to offer for those interested in fashion and the performing and visual arts or for those who want to celebrate Halloween and with food and drinks from all around the city. Each year the event is put on with a different theme and it increases in size and popularity.\n\n\n"}

It stars Myers in his feature film debut as Wayne Campbell and Dana Carvey as Garth Algar, a pair of rock fans who broadcast a public-access television show. It also features Rob Lowe, Tia Carrere, Lara Flynn Boyle, Brian Doyle-Murray, Chris Farley, Ed O'Neill, Ione Skye, Meat Loaf, and Alice Cooper.\n\n\"Wayne's World\" was released in the US on February 14, 1992. It was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 1992 and it remains the highest-grossing film based on \"Saturday Night Live\" skits. A sequel, \"Wayne's World 2\", was released on December 10, 1993.\n\nIn Aurora, Illinois, rock fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar host a public-access television show, \"Wayne's World\", from Wayne's parents' basement. After they sell the rights to the show to television producer Benjamin Oliver for $10,000, they celebrate at a night club, where they avoid Wayne's troubled ex-girlfriend Stacy. Wayne falls for Cassandra Wong, vocalist and bassist of the band performing that night, Crucial Taunt, and impresses her with his Cantonese. He purchases a 1964 Fender Stratocaster electric guitar he has long coveted.\n\nBenjamin attempts to steal Cassandra from Wayne by using his wealth and good looks. He distracts Wayne and Garth with all-access tickets to an Alice Cooper concert in Milwaukee, while offering to produce a music video for Crucial Taunt. At the concert, Wayne and Garth make the acquaintance of a bodyguard to music producer Frankie Sharp, head of Sharp Records.\n\nWhile filming the revamped \"Wayne's World\" under Benjamin's oversight, Wayne and Garth find it difficult to adjust to the professional studio environment. Their contract obliges them to give a promotional interview to their sponsor, Noah Vanderhoff, who owns a franchise of amusement arcades. After Wayne publicly ridicules Vanderhoff, he is fired from the show, causing a rift in his friendship with Garth. Jealous of the attention Benjamin is giving Cassandra, Wayne attempts to prevent her from participating in the Crucial Taunt music video shoot. She breaks up with him, furious at his lack of trust.\n\nWayne and Garth reunite and hatch a plan to win Cassandra back by having Sharp hear Crucial Taunt play. While Garth and their friends infiltrate a satellite station with the aid of Benjamin's assistant, Wayne goes to Cassandra's video shoot, but embarrasses himself in an attempt to expose Benjamin's ulterior motive. As he leaves, Cassandra changes her mind about Benjamin. Wayne apologizes and they return to Aurora.\n\nThe \"Wayne's World\" crew hacks into Sharp's satellite television and broadcast the Crucial Taunt performance from Wayne's basement, where Sharp and Benjamin converge. Sharp declines to offer Crucial Taunt a record contract, Cassandra breaks up with Wayne and departs with Benjamin for a tropical resort, Stacy reveals that she is pregnant with Wayne's child, and a fire destroys Wayne's house.\n\nDissatisfied, Wayne and Garth turn to the film's audience and halt proceedings. They restart the scene and unmask Benjamin as \"Old Man Withers\" in a \"Scooby-Doo\" parody ending. Still unsatisfied, they start again with a \"mega happy ending\" in which Cassandra signs a record contract and reunites with Wayne, Garth begins a relationship with a waitress, and Benjamin learns that money and good looks do not necessarily bring happiness.\n\n\n\"Wayne's World\" was greenlit by Paramount Pictures in 1991. It was the second film based on a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch following \"The Blues Brothers\" in 1980. Producer Lorne Michaels hired Penelope Spheeris to direct, who had directed several music documentaries. Spheeris said, \"I had been just struggling as a female director in this business for many years. I was 45 years old when I got that job. I just kept hanging in there. And \"Wayne's World\" happened, and it sort of flipped my life around.\"\n\nSpheeris clashed with Myers during filming. She told \"Entertainment Weekly\" that Myers was \"emotionally needy and got more difficult as the shoot went along. You should have heard him bitching when I was trying to do that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' scene: 'I can't move my neck like that! Why do we have to do this so many times? No one is going to laugh at that!'\" She said she attempted to assuage Myers by having her daughter provide him snacks, and on one occasion he stormed off the set, upset that there was no margarine for his bagel. Myers and Spheeris argued over the final cut of the film, causing Myers to prevent Spheeris from directing \"Wayne' World 2\".\n\nThe movie was a box office success, debuting at number one. The film's final domestic gross was $121,697,323, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 1992 and the highest-grossing of the 11 films based on \"Saturday Night Live\" skits.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 84% \"Certified Fresh\" rating based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10, with the critical consensus stating, \"An oddball comedy that revels in its silliness and memorable catchphrases, \"Wayne's World\" is also fondly regarded because of its endearing characters.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 53 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Roger Ebert said in his review: \"I walked into \"Wayne's World\" expecting a lot of dumb, vulgar comedy, and I got plenty, but I also found what I didn't expect: a genuinely amusing, sometimes even intelligent, undercurrent.\" However, Desson Howe wrote in the \"Washington Post\" that making a movie out of such a \"teeny sketch\" is \"better than you'd expect\" but criticized the finale as \"an attempt to lampoon movie endings\" \"and a despair-driven inability to end the movie\".\n\nFilled with pop culture references, the sketches and the film started catchphrases such as \"Schwing!\" and \"Schyea\", as well as popularizing \"That's what she said\", \"Party on!\" and the use of \"Not!\" after apparently affirmative sentences in order to state the contrary.\n\nAmerican Film Institute recognition:\n\n\n"}

This forms a V-shaped neckline and hugs the wearer's curves. A faux wrap dress resembles this design, except that it comes already fastened together with no opening in front, but instead is slipped on over the head. A wrap top is a top cut and constructed in the same way as a wrap dress, but without a skirt.\n\nAlthough it is often claimed that Diane von Fürstenberg 'invented' the wrap dress in 1972/73, Richard Martin, a former curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, noted that the form of Fürstenberg's design had already been \"deeply embedded into the American designer sportswear tradition,\" with her choice of elastic, synthetic fabrics distinguishing her work from earlier wrap dresses. During the Great Depression, house dresses called \"Hooverettes\" were popular which employed a wrap design. Wrap dresses were designed by Elsa Schiaparelli in the 1930s and by Claire McCardell in the 1940s, whose original 'popover' design became the basis for a variety of wrap-around dresses. \nThe Fürstenberg interpretation of the wrap dress, which was consistently knee-length, in a clinging jersey, with long sleeves, was so popular and so distinctive that the style has generally become associated with her. She has stated that her divorce inspired the design, and also suggested it was created in the spirit of enabling women to enjoy sexual freedom. In 2004 a book dedicated entirely to Fürstenberg's wrap dresses was published.\n\nWrap dresses achieved their peak of popularity in the mid to late 1970s, and the design has been credited with becoming a symbol of women's liberation in the 1970s. They experienced renewed popularity beginning in the late 1990s, particularly after von Fürstenberg reintroduced her wrap dress in 1997; she, among others, has continued to design wrap dresses since then. The wrap dress's popularity and its perceived feminist significance have remained current into the mid-2010s.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2036621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2036621", "title": "Zinaida Gippius", "text": "Zinaida Gippius\n\nZinaida Nikolayevna Gippius (; – 9 September 1945) was a Russian poet, playwright, novelist, editor and religious thinker, one of the major figures in Russian symbolism. The story of her marriage to Dmitry Merezhkovsky, which lasted 52 years, is described in her unfinished book \"Dmitry Merezhkovsky\" (Paris, 1951; Moscow, 1991).\n\nShe began writing at an early age, and by the time she met Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1888, she was already a published poet. The two were married in 1889. Gippius published her first book of poetry, \"Collection of Poems. 1889–1903\", in 1903, and her second collection, \"Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909\", in 1910. After the 1905 Revolution, the Merezhkovskys became critics of Tsarism; they spent several years abroad during this time, including trips for treatment of health issues. They denounced the 1917 October Revolution, seeing it as a cultural disaster, and in 1919 emigrated to Poland.\n\nAfter living in Poland they moved to France, and then to Italy, continuing to publish and take part in Russian émigré circles, though Gippius's harsh literary criticism made enemies. The tragedy of the exiled Russian writer was a major topic for Gippius in emigration, but she also continued to explore mystical and covertly sexual themes, publishing short stories, plays, novels, poetry, and memoirs. The death of Merezhkovsky in 1941 was a major blow to Gippius, who died a few years later in 1945.\n\nZinaida Gippius was born on , in Belyov, Tula, the eldest of four sisters. Her father, Nikolai Romanovich Gippius, a respected lawyer and a senior officer in the Russian Senate, was a German-Russian, whose ancestor Adolphus von Gingst, later von Hippius, came to settle in Moscow in the 16th century. Her mother, Anastasia Vasilyevna ( Stepanova), was a daughter of the Yekaterinburg Chief of Police.\n\nNikolai Gippius's job entailed constant traveling, and because of this his daughters received little formal education. Taking lessons from governesses and visiting tutors, they attended schools sporadically in whatever city (Saratov, Tula and Kiev, among others) the family happened to stay for a significant period of time. At the age of 48 Nikolai Gippius died of tuberculosis, and Anastasia Vasilyevna, knowing that all of her girls had inherited a predisposition to the illness that killed him, moved the family southwards, first to Yalta (where Zinaida had medical treatment) then in 1885 to Tiflis, closer to their uncle Alexander Stepanov's home.\n\nBy this time, Zinaida had already studied for two years at a girls' school in Kiev (1877—1878) and for a year at the Moscow Fischer Gymnasium. It was only in Borzhomi where her uncle Alexander, a man of considerable means, rented a dacha for her, that she started to get back to normal after the profound shock caused by her beloved father's death.\n\nZinaida started writing poetry at the age of seven. By the time she met Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1888, she was already a published poet. \"By the year 1880 I was writing verses, being a great believer in 'inspiration', and making it a point never to take my pen away from paper. People around me saw these poems as a sign of my being 'spoiled', but I never tried to conceal them and, of course, I wasn't spoiled at all, what with my religious upbringing,\" she wrote in 1902 in a letter to Valery Bryusov. A good-looking girl, Zinaida attracted a lot of attention in Borzhomi, but Merezhkovsky, a well-educated introvert, impressed her first and foremost as a perfect kindred spirit. Once he proposed, she accepted him without hesitation, and never came to regret what might have seemed a hasty decision.\n\nGippius and Merezhkovsky were married on 8 January 1889, in Tiflis. They had a short honeymoon tour involving a stay in the Crimea, then returned to Saint Petersburg and moved into a flat in what was known then as the Muruzi House, which Merezhkovsky's mother had rented and furnished for them as a wedding gift.\n\nMerezhkovsky and Gippius made a pact, each promising to concentrate on what he or she did best, the former on poetry, the latter on prose. The agreement collapsed as Zinaida translated Lord Byron's \"Manfred\", and Dimitry started working on his debut novel \"Julian the Apostate\". In Saint Petersburg Gippius joined the Russian Literary Society, became a member of the Shakespearean Circle (the celebrity lawyer Prince Alexander Urusov being its most famous member), and met and befriended Yakov Polonsky, Apollon Maykov, Dmitry Grigorovich, Aleksey Pleshcheyev and Pyotr Veinberg. She became close to the group of authors associated with the renovated \"Severny Vestnik\", where she herself made her major debut as a poet in 1888.\n\nIn 1890–91 this magazine published her first short stories, \"The Ill-Fated One\" and \"In Moscow\". Then three of her novels, \"Without the Talisman\", \"The Winner\", and \"Small Waves\", appeared in \"Mir Bozhy\". Seeing the writing of mediocre, generic prose as a commercial enterprise, Gippius treated her poetry differently, as something utterly intimate, calling her verses 'personal prayers'. Dealing with the darker side of the human soul and exploring sexual ambiguity and narcissism, many of those 'prayers' were considered blasphemous at the time. Detractors called Gippius a 'demoness', the 'queen of duality', and a 'decadent Madonna'. Enjoying the notoriety, she exploited her androgynous image, used male clothes and pseudonyms, shocked her guests with insults ('to watch their reaction', as she once explained to Nadezhda Teffi), and for a decade remained the Russian symbol of 'sexual liberation', holding high what she in one of her diary entries termed as the 'cross of sensuality'. In 1901 all this transformed into the ideology of the \"New Church\" of which she was the instigator.\n\nIn October 1903 the \"Collection of Poems. 1889–1903\", Gippius's first book of poetry, came out; Innokenty Annensky later called the book the \"quintessence of fifteen years of Russian modernism.\" Valery Bryusov was greatly impressed too, praising the \"insurmountable frankness with which she document[ed] the emotional progress of her enslaved soul.\" Gippius herself never thought much of the social significance of her published poetry. In a foreword to her debut collection she wrote: \"It is sad to realize that one had to produce something as useless and meaningless as this book. Not that I think poetry to be useless; on the contrary, I am convinced that it is essential, natural and timeless. There were times when poetry was read everywhere and appreciated by everybody. But those times are gone. A modern reader has no use for a book of poetry any more.\"\n\nIn the early 1900s the Muruzi House acquired the reputation of being one of the Russian capital's new cultural centers. Guests recognized and admired the hostess's authority and her talent for leadership, even if none of them found her particularly warm or affectionate.\n\nIn 1899—1901, encouraged by the group of authors associated with \"Mir Iskusstva\", the magazine she had become close to, Gippius published critical essays in it using male pseudonyms, Anton Krainy being the best known. Analyzing the roots of the crisis that Russian culture had fallen into, Gippius (somewhat paradoxically, given her 'demonic' reputation) suggested as a remedy the 'Christianization' of it, which in practice meant bringing the intelligentsia and the Church closer together. Merging faith and intellect, according to Gippius, was crucial for the survival of Russia; only religious ideas, she thought, would bring its people enlightenment and liberation, both sexual and spiritual.\n\nIn 1901 Gippius and Merezhkovsky co-founded the Religious and Philosophical Meetings. This 'gathering for free discussion', focusing on the synthesis of culture and religion, brought together an eclectic mix of intellectuals and was regarded in retrospect as an important, if short-lived attempt to pull Russia back from the major social upheavals it was headed for. Gippius was the driving force behind the Meetings, as well as the magazine \"Novy Put\" (1903–04), launched initially as a vehicle for the former. By the time \"Novy Put\" folded (due to a conflict caused by the newcomer Sergei Bulgakov's refusal to publish her essay on Alexander Blok), Gippius (as Anton Krainy) had become a prominent literary critic, contributing mostly to \"Vesy\" (Scales).\n\nAfter the Meetings were closed in 1903, Gippius tried to revive her initial idea in the form of what was regarded as her 'domestic Church', based on the controversial Troyebratstvo (Brotherhood of Three), composed of herself, Merezhkovsky, and Dmitry Filosofov, their mutual close friend and, for a short while, her lover. This new development outraged many of their friends, like Nikolai Berdyaev who saw this bizarre parody on the Trinity, with its own set of quasi-religious rituals, as profanation bordering on blasphemy.\n\nThe 1905 Revolution had a profound impact on Gippius. During the next decade the Merezhkovskys were harsh critics of Tsarism, radical revolutionaries like Boris Savinkov now entering their narrow circle of close friends. In February 1906 the couple left for France to spend more than two years in what they saw as self-imposed exile, trying to introduce Western intellectuals to their 'new religious consciousness'. In 1906 Gippius published the collection of short stories \"Scarlet Sword\" (Алый меч), and in 1908 the play \"Poppie Blossom\" (Маков цвет) came out, with Merezhkovsky and Filosofov credited as co-authors.\n\nDisappointed with the indifference of European cultural elites to their ideas, the trio returned home. Back in Saint Petersburg Gippius's health deteriorated, and for the next six years she (along with her husband, who had heart problems) regularly visited European health resorts and clinics. During one such voyage in 1911 Gippius bought a cheap apartment in Paris, at Rue Colonel Bonnet, 11-bis. What at the time felt like a casual, unnecessary purchase, later saved them from homelessness abroad.\n\nAs the political tension in Russia subsided, the Meetings were re-opened as the Religious and Philosophical Society, in 1908. But Russian Church leaders ignored it, and soon the project withered into a mere literary circle. The heated discussion over the \"Vekhi\" manifesto led to a clash between the Merezhkovskys and Filosofov on the one hand and Vasily Rozanov on the other; the latter quit and severed ties with his old friends.\n\nBy the time her \"Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909\" came out in 1910, Gippius has become a well-known (though by no means as famous as her husband) European author, translated into German and French. In 1912 her book of short stories \"Moon Ants\" (Лунные муравьи) came out, featuring the best prose she had written in years. The two novels, \"The Demon Dolls\" (Чортовы куклы, 1911) and \"Roman-Tsarevich\" (Роман-царевич, 1912), were meant to be the first and the third book of the Hieromonk Iliodor trilogy, which remained unfinished. The literary left panned them as allegedly 'anti-revolutionary', mainstream critics found these books lackluster, formulaic and tendentious.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I, the Merezhkovskys spoke out against Russia's involvement. Still, Gippius launched a support-the-soldiers campaign of her own, producing a series of frontline-forwarded letters, each combining stylized folk poetic messages with small tobacco-packets, signed with either her own, or one of her three servant maids' names. Some dismissed it as pretentious and meaningless, others applauded what they saw as her reaction to the jingoistic hysteria of the time.\n\nThe Merezhkovskys greeted the 1917 February Revolution and denounced the October Revolution, blaming Alexander Kerensky and his Provisional government for the catastrophe. In her book of memoirs \"Dmitry Merezhkovsky. Him and Us\" Gippius wrote: \n\nGippius saw the October Revolution as the end of Russia and the coming of the Kingdom of Antichrist. \"It felt as if some pillow fell on you to strangle... Strangle what — the city? The country? No, something much, much bigger,\" — she wrote in her 26 October 1917, diary entry. In late 1917 Gippius was still able to publish her anti-Bolshevik verses in what remained of the old newspapers, but the next year was nightmarish, according to her \"Diaries\". Ridiculing H. G. Wells (\"I can see why he is so attracted to the Bolsheviks: they’ve leapfrogged him\"), she wrote of Cheka atrocities (\"In Kiev 1200 officers killed; legs severed, boots taken off.\" — 23 February. \"In Rostov teenager cadets shot down — for being mistakenly taken for Constitutional Democratic Party cadets, the banned ones.\" — 17 March), of mass hunger and her own growing feeling of dull indifference. \"Those who still have a soul in them walk around like corpses: neither protesting, nor suffering, waiting for nothing, bodies and souls slumped into hunger-induced dormancy.\"\n\nExpressing some sympathy for 'the weeping Lunacharsky' (the only Bolshevik leader to express at least some regret concerning the cruelties of the repressive organs), Gippius wrote: \"The things that happen now have nothing to do with Russian history. They will be forgotten, like the atrocities of some savages on a faraway island; will vanish without a trace.\" \"Last Poems (1914–1918)\", published in 1918, presented a stark and gloomy picture of revolutionary Russia as Gippius saw it. After the defeats of Alexander Kolchak in Siberia and Anton Denikin in Southern Russia, respectively, the Merezhkovskys moved to Petrograd. In late 1919, invited to join a group of 'red professors' in Crimea, Gippius chose not to, having heard of massacres orchestrated by local chiefs Bela Kun and Rosalia Zemlyachka. Having obtained permission to leave the city (the pretext being that they would head for the frontlines, with lectures on Ancient Egypt for Red Army fighters), Merezhkovsky and Gippius, as well as her secretary Vladimir Zlobin and Dmitry Filosofov, departed to Poland by train.\n\nTheir first destination was Minsk where Merezhkovsky and Gippius gave a series of lectures for Russian immigrants and published political pamphlets in the \"Minsk Courier\". During a stay of several months in Warsaw Gippius edited the \"Svoboda\" newspaper. Disillusioned with Jozef Pilsudski's policies, the Merezhkovskys and Zlobin left for France on 20 October without Filosofov, who chose to stay in the city with Boris Savinkov. In Paris Gippius concentrated on making appointments, sorting out mail, negotiating contracts and receiving guests. The Merezhkovsky's talks, as Nina Berberova remembered, always revolved around two major themes: Russia and freedom. Backing Merezhkovsky in his anti-Bolshevik crusade, she was deeply pessimistic as regards what her husband referred to as his 'mission'. \"Our slavery is so unheard of and our revelations are so outlandish that for a free man it is difficult to understand what we are talking about,\" she conceded.\n\nThe tragedy of the exiled Russian writer became a major topic for Gippius in emigration, but she also continued to explore mystical and covertly sexual themes. She remained a harsh literary critic and, by dismissing many of the well-known writers of the Symbolist and Acmeist camps, made herself an unpopular figure in France.\n\nIn the early 1920s several of Gippius's earlier works were re-issued in the West, including the collection of stories \"Heavenly Words\" (Небесные слова, 1921, Paris) and the \"Poems. 1911–1912 Diary\" (1922, Berlin). In Munich \"The Kingdom of Antichrist\" (Царство Антихриста), authored by Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov, and Zlobin, came out, including the first two parts of Gippius's \"Petersburg Diaries\" (Петербургские дневники). Gippius was the major force behind the \"Green Lamp\" (Зелёная лампа) society, named after the 19th century group associated with Alexander Pushkin. Fractional altercations aside, it proved to be the only cultural center where Russian émigré writers and philosophers (carefully chosen for each meeting and invited personally) could meet and discuss political and cultural topics.\n\nIn 1928 the Merezhkovskys took part in the First Congress of Russian writers in exile held in Belgrade. Encouraged by the success of Merezhkovsky's Da Vinci series of lectures and Benito Mussolini's benevolence, in 1933 the couple moved to Italy where they stayed for about three years, visiting Paris only occasionally. With the Socialist movement rising there and anti-Russian emigration feelings spurred by President Paul Doumer's murder in 1932, France felt like a hostile place to them. Living in exile was very hard for Gippius psychologically. As one biographer put it, \"her metaphysically grandiose personality, with its spiritual and intellectual overload, was out of place in what she herself saw as a 'soullessly pragmatic' period in European history.\"\n\nAs the outbreak of World War II in Europe rendered literature virtually irrelevant, Gippius, against all odds, compiled and published the \"Literature Tornado\", an ambitious literary project set up to provide a safe haven for writers rejected by publishers for ideological reasons. What in other times might have been hailed as a powerful act in support of the freedom of speech, in 1939 passed unnoticed. Merezhkovsky and Gippius spent their last year together in a social vacuum. Regardless of whether or not the 1944 text of Merezhkovsky's allegedly pro-Hitler \"Radio speech\" was indeed a prefabricated montage (as his biographer Zobnin asserted), there was little doubt that the couple, having become too close to (and financially dependent on) the Germans in Paris, had lost respect and credibility as far as their compatriots were concerned, many of whom expressed outright hatred toward them.\n\nMerezhkovsky's death in 1941 came as a heavy blow to Gippius. After the deaths of Dmitry Filosofov and her sister Anna (in 1940 and 1942 respectively) she found herself alone in the world and, as some sources suggest, contemplated suicide. With her secretary Vladimir Zlobin still around, though, Gippius resorted to writing what she hoped would some day gel into the comprehensive life story of her late husband. As Teffi remembered, \nGippius died on 9 September 1945. Her last written words were: \"Low is my price... And wise is God.\" She was interred in Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery with her husband. A small group of people attended the ceremony, among them Ivan Bunin.\n\nModern scholars see Gippius's romantically tinged early poems as mostly derivative, Semyon Nadson and Friedrich Nietzsche being the two most obvious influences. The publication of Dmitry Merezhkovky's symbolist manifesto proved to be a turning point: in a short time Gippius became a major figure of Russian Modernism. Her early symbolist prose carried the strong influence of Dostoyevsky, while one of her later novels, \"Roman Tzarevich\" (1912), was said to be influenced again by Nietzsche. Gippius's first two short story collections, \"New People\" (1896) and \"Mirrors\" (1898), examining \"the nature of beauty in all of its manifestations and contradictions,\" were seen as formulaic. Her \"Third Book of Short Stories\" (1902) marked a change of direction and was described as \"sickly idiosyncratic\" and full of \"highbrow mysticism.\" Parallels have been drawn between Gippius's early 20th century prose and Vladimir Solovyov's \"Meaning of Love\", both authors examining the 'quest for love' as the means for self-fulfillment of the human soul.\n\nIt was not prose but poetry that made Gippius a major innovative force. \"Gippius the poet holds her own special place in Russian literature; her poems are deeply intellectual, immaculate in form, and genuinely exciting.\" Critics praised her originality and technical virtuosity, claiming her to be a \"true heir to Yevgeny Baratynsky's muse\".\n\nHer \"Collection of Poems. 1889–1903\" became an important event in Russian cultural life. Having defined the world of poetry as a three-dimensional structure involving \"Love and Eternity meeting in Death\", she discovered and explored in it her own brand of ethic and aesthetic minimalism. Symbolist writers were the first to praise her 'hint and pause' metaphor technique, as well as the art of \"extracting sonorous chords out of silent pianos,\" according to Innokenty Annensky, who saw the book as the artistic peak of \"Russia's 15 years of modernism\" and argued that \"not a single man would ever be able to dress abstractions in clothes of such charm [as this woman].\" Men admired Gippius's outspokenness too: Gippius commented on her inner conflicts, full of 'demonic temptations' (inevitable for a poet whose mission was 'creating a new, true soul', as she put it), with unusual frankness.\n\nThe 1906 collection \"Scarlet Sword\", described as a study in the 'human soul's metaphysics' performed from the neo-Christian standpoint, propagated the idea of God and man as one single being. The author equated 'self-denial' with the sin of betraying God, and detractors suspected blasphemy in this egocentric stance. Sex and death themes, investigated in the obliquely impressionist manner formed the leitmotif of her next book of prose, \"Black on White\" (1908). The 20th century also saw the rise of Gippius the playwright (\"Saintly Blood\", 1900, \"Poppie Blossom\", 1908). The most acclaimed of her plays, \"The Green Ring\" (1916), futuristic in plotline, if not in form, was successfully produced by Vsevolod Meyerhold for the Alexandrinsky Theatre. Anton Krainy, Gippius's alter ego, was a highly respected and somewhat feared literary critic whose articles regularly appeared in \"Novy Put\", \"Vesy\" and \"Russkaya Mysl\". Gippius's critical analysis, according to Brockhaus and Efron, was insightful, but occasionally too harsh and rarely objective.\n\nThe 1910 \"Collection of Poems. Book 2. 1903-1909\" garnered good reviews; Bunin called Gippius's poetry 'electric', pointing at the peculiar use of oxymoron as an electrifying force in the author's hermetic, impassive world. Some contemporaries found Gippius's works curiously unfeminine. Vladislav Khodasevich spoke of the conflict between her \"poetic soul and non-poetic mind.\" \"Everything is strong and spatial in her verse, there is little room for details. Her lively, sharp thought, dressed in emotional complexity, sort of rushes out of her poems, looking for spiritual wholesomeness and ideal harmony,\" modern scholar Vitaly Orlov said.\n\nGippius's novels \"The Devil's Doll\" (1911) and \"Roman Tzarevich\" (1912), aiming to \"lay bare the roots of Russian reactionary ideas,\" were unsuccessful: critics found them tendentious and artistically inferior. \"In poetry Gippius is more original than in prose. Well constructed, full of intriguing ideas, never short of insight, her stories and novellas are always a bit too preposterous, stiff and uninspired, showing little knowledge of real life. Gippius's characters pronounce interesting words and find themselves in interestingly difficult situations but fail to turn into living people in the reader's mind. Serving as embodiments of ideas and concepts, they are genuinely crafted marionettes put into action by the author's hand, not by their own inner motives.\"\n\nThe events of October 1917 led to Gippius severing all ties with most of those who admired her poetry, including Blok, Bryusov and Bely. The history of this schism and the reconstruction of the ideological collisions that made such a catastrophe possible became the subject matter of her memoirs \"The Living Faces\" (Живые лица, 1925). While Blok (the man whom she famously refused her hand in 1918) saw the Revolution as a 'purifying storm', Gippius was appalled by the 'suffocating dourness' of the whole thing, seeing it as one huge monstrosity \"leaving one with just one wish: to go blind and deaf.\" Behind all this, for Gippius, there was a kind of 'monumental madness'; it was all the more important for her to keep a \"healthy mind and strong memory,\" she explained.\n\nAfter \"Last Poems\" (1918) Gippius published two more books of verse, \"Poems. 1911–1920 Diaries\" (1922) and \"The Shining Ones\" (1938). Her poetry, prose and essays published in emigration were utterly pessimistic; the 'rule of beastliness', the ruins of human culture, and the demise of civilization were her major themes. Most valuable for Gippius were her diaries: she saw these flash points of personal history as essential for helping future generations to restore the true course of events. Yet, as a modern Russian critic has put it, \"Gippius's legacy, for all its inner drama and antinomy, its passionate, forceful longing for the unfathomable, has always borne the ray of hope, the fiery, unquenchable belief in a higher truth and the ultimate harmony crowning a person's destiny. As she herself wrote in one of her last poems, \"Alas, now they are torn apart: the timelessness and all things human / But time will come and both will intertwine into one shimmering eternity'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
