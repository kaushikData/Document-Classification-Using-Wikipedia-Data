{"id": "31572452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31572452", "title": "Almond Blossoms", "text": "Almond Blossoms\n\nAlmond Blossoms is from a group of several paintings made in 1888 and 1890 by Vincent van Gogh in Arles and Saint-Rémy, southern France of blossoming almond trees. Flowering trees were special to van Gogh. They represented awakening and hope. He enjoyed them aesthetically and found joy in painting flowering trees. The works reflect the influence of Impressionism, Divisionism, and Japanese woodcuts. \"Almond Blossom\" was made to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, son of his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo.\n\nIn 1888 van Gogh became inspired in southern France and began the most productive period of his painting career. In connection with their painting \"Farmhouse in Provence\" (1888), the National Gallery of Art notes that\n\"It was sun that van Gogh sought in Provence, a brilliance and light that would wash out detail and simplify forms,\nreducing the world around him to the sort of pattern he admired in Japanese woodblocks. Arles, he said, was \"the Japan of the South.\" Here, he felt, the flattening effect of the sun would strengthen the outlines of compositions and reduce nuances of color to a few vivid contrasts. Pairs of complements—the red and green of the plants, the woven highlights of oranges and blue in the fence, even the pink clouds that enliven the turquoise sky — almost vibrate against each other.\"\n\nWhen van Gogh arrived in Arles in March 1888 fruit trees in the orchards were about to bloom. The blossoms of the apricot, peach and plum trees motivated him, and within a month he had created fourteen paintings of blossoming fruit trees. Excited by the subject matter, van Gogh completed nearly one painting a day. Around April 21 he wrote to Theo, that he \"will have to seek something new, now the orchards have almost finished blossoming.\"\nVan Gogh's work reflected his interest in Japanese wood block prints. Hiroshige's \"Plum Park in Kameido\" demonstrates portrayal of beautiful subject matter with flat patterns of colors and no shadow. Van Gogh used the term \"Japonaiserie\" to express this influence; he collected hundreds of Japanese prints and likened the works of the great Japanese artists, like Hiroshige, to those of Rembrandt, Hals, and Vermeer. Hiroshige was one of the last great masters of the Japanese genre called \"ukiyo-e\". Van Gogh integrated some of the technical aspects of ukiyo-e into his work as his two 1887 homages to Hiroshige demonstrates.\n\nThe Japanese paintings represent Van Gogh's search for serenity, which he describes in a letter to his sister, \"Having as much of this serenity as possible, even though one knows little – nothing – for certain, is perhaps a better remedy for all diseases than all the things that are sold at the chemist's shop.\" The southern region and the flowering trees seems to awakened van Gogh from his doldrums into a state of clear direction, hyper-activity and good cheer. He wrote, \"I am up to my ears in work for the trees are in blossom and I want to paint a Provençal orchard of astonishing gaiety.\" While in the past a very active period would have drained him, this time he was invigorated.\n\nVincent wrote to Theo, \"Down here it is freezing hard and there is still snow in the countryside,\" and he has \"two small studies of an almond-tree branch already in flower in spite of it.\" The two studies are \"Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass\" and \"Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book.\"\n\nAlthough fruit trees were about to bloom when Vincent arrived in Arles, the town had just received a layer of snow, driving van Gogh inside for his first week in Arles where he worked on still life, such as a branch from an almond tree. To reflect the early signs of spring, he used delicate brushstrokes and pastel shades for \"Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass\".\n\nIn \"Art Inspiring Transmutations of Life\", Bruce Ross evaluates the Impressionists' effect on van Gogh's work, \n\"Van Gogh's bright \"Sprig of Flowering Almond in a Glass\" embodies these streams* while exploring Japanese aesthetic values. A broken-off sprig is set in a simple glass. The sprig is highlighted by a red line along the beige wall and lavish empty space. There is no formal decorative intent. Van Gogh's name, also in bright red, hovers above a sprig in the upper left as if a symbol of hope. Van Gogh has transformed the still life with the help of these values. He has imbued a form predicated on death to one focused on life and possibility. His use of bright color reflects this. There is an individual, and hence essential, character to his subject, a sprig of almond buds and opening blossoms. This still life resembles the Japanese art of flower arrangement, ikebana, in its simplicity and evoked hopefulness as well as in its formal use of empty space.\"\n\nIn mid-March 1888 van Gogh writes of the weather and that the almond trees are coming into full flower, \"The weather here is changeable, often windy with turbulent skies, but the almond trees are beginning to flower everywhere.\"\n\nMancoff says of flowering trees and this work,\n\"In his flowering trees, Vincent attained a sense of spontaneity, freeing himself from the strict self-analytical approach he took in Paris. In \"Almond Tree in Blossom\", Vincent used the light, broken strokes of impressionism and the dabs of colour of divisionism for a sparkling surface effect. The distinctive contours of the tree and its position in the foreground recall the formal qualities of Japanese prints.\"\n\nThe rendering of \"Almond Blossom\" is positioned close and accessible to the viewer and the branches appear to reach out beyond the painting's frame.\n\nTheo wrote to his brother Vincent on January 31, 1890 to announce the birth of his son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. As a means of celebration, Vincent began work on a painting for Theo and his wife. He was very close to his brother and he sought to symbolize new life in the flowers of the almond tree for the birth of baby Vincent.\n\nVincent wrote to his mother of the birth of Theo and Jo's baby,\n\"How glad I was when the news came... I should have greatly preferred him to call the boy after Father, of whom I have been thinking so much these days, instead of after me; but seeing it has now been done, I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, big branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky.\"\n\nThe composition is unlike any other of van Gogh's paintings. The branches of the almond tree seem to float against the blue sky and fill the picture plane. The close-up of the branches brings to mind Delacroix's proposition that \"even a part of a thing is kind of a complete entity in itself.\" Dark lines outline the branches. This is a feature that Van Gogh had admired in Japanese floral studies that, for example, may depict a portion of a stalk of bamboo in an empty space. The bright color is reflective of the paintings made in Arles and the transformational work van Gogh had on the still life genre.\n\n"}

It is now in the collection of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.\n\nIn the ninth thesis of his 1940 essay “Theses on the Philosophy of History”, the German critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin, who purchased the print in 1921, interprets it this way:\n\nA Klee painting named \"Angelus Novus\" shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.\n\nOtto Karl Werckmeister notes that Benjamin's reading of Klee's New Angel image has led to it becoming \"an icon of the left.\"\n\nThe name and concept of the angel has inspired works by other artists, filmmakers, writers and musicians, including John Akomfrah, Ariella Azoulay, Carolyn Forché, and Rabih Alameddine.\n\nIn September 1940 Walter Benjamin committed suicide during an attempt to flee the Nazi regime. After World War II Walter Benjamin’s lifelong friend, Gershom Scholem (1897–1982), the distinguished scholar of Jewish mysticism, inherited the drawing. According to Scholem, Benjamin felt a mystical identification with the \"Angelus Novus\" and incorporated it in his theory of the “angel of history,” a melancholy view of historical process as an unceasing cycle of despair.\n\nIn 2015, in conjunction with her solo exhibition at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, American artist R. H. Quaytman discovered that the monoprint had been adhered to an 1838 copper-plate engraving by Friedrich Muller after a Lucas Cranach portrait of Martin Luther.\n"}

They are examples of Ardabil rugs.\n\nThe foundation is of silk with wool pile of a knot density at 300–350 knots per square inch (47–54 knots per cm). The size of the London carpet is , which gives it about 26 million knots in total. The carpets have an inscription: a couplet from a ghazal by Persian mythic poet Hafiz Shirazi and a signature. The difference in size between the two lamp motifs flanking the central medallion is now seen as a deliberate use of graphical perspective; when seen from the end with the smaller lamp the two appear the same size. The design of the central medallion resembles that of the interior side of the dome of the Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan.\n\nCompleted during the rule of the Safavid Shah Tahmasp I in the mid-16th century, probably in Tabriz, the carpets are considered some of the best of the classical Iranian (Persian) school of carpet creation. They were first placed in a mosque in Ardabil, but they had become heavily worn in Iran and were sold in 1890 to a British carpet broker who restored one of the carpets using the other and then resold the restored one to the Victoria and Albert Museum. William Morris, then an art referee for the V&A, was instrumental in the acquisition.\n\nThe second \"secret\" carpet, smaller, now borderless and with some of the field missing, and made up from the remaining usable sections, was sold to American businessmen Clarence Mackay and was exchanged by wealthy buyers for years. Passing through the Mackay, Yerkes, and De la Mare art collections, it was eventually revealed and shown in 1931 at an exhibition in London. American industrialist J. Paul Getty saw it, and bought it from Lord Duveen for approximately $70,000 several years later. Getty was approached by agents on behalf of King Farouk of Egypt who offered $250,000 so that it could be given as a wedding present to his sister and the Shah of Iran. Getty later donated the carpet to the Los Angeles County Museum of Science, History, and Art in the Exposition Park in Los Angeles. Other fragments have appeared on the market from time to time. The knot density is actually higher on the Los Angeles carpet. \n\nThis Persian carpet has been the subject of numerous copies ranging in size from small rugs to full scale carpets. There is an 'Ardabil' at 10 Downing Street and even Hitler had an 'Ardabil' in his office in Berlin. The London carpet was for decades displayed hanging on a wall. Since 2006, it has been shown flat in a special glass pavilion in the centre of the main gallery of Islamic art. The lighting is kept low to prevent fading.\n\n"}
{"id": "14198098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14198098", "title": "Artists of the Tudor court", "text": "Artists of the Tudor court\n\nThe artists of the Tudor court are the painters and limners engaged by the monarchs of England's Tudor dynasty and their courtiers between 1485 and 1603, from the reign of Henry VII to the death of Elizabeth I.\n\nTypically managing a group of assistants and apprentices in a workshop or studio, many of these artists produced works across several disciplines, including portrait miniatures, large-scale panel portraits on wood, illuminated manuscripts, heraldric emblems, and elaborate decorative schemes for masques, tournaments, and other events.\n\nThe Tudor period was one of unusual isolation from European trends for England. At the start the Wars of the Roses had greatly disrupted artistic activity, which apart from architecture had reached a very low ebb by 1485. The Yorkist dynasty overthrown by the Tudors had been very close to their Burgundian allies, and English diplomats had their portraits painted by the finest Early Netherlandish painters - Edward Grimshaw by Petrus Christus and Sir John Donne by Hans Memling (both National Gallery, London). However these were both painted abroad. In the Tudor period foreign artists were recruited and often welcomed lavishly by the English court, as they were in other artistically marginal parts of Europe like Spain or Naples. The Netherlandish painters remained predominant, though French influence was also important on both Lucas Horenbout and Nicholas Hilliard, respectively the founder and the greatest exponent of the distinctively English tradition of the portrait miniature.\n\nWith the virtual extinction of religious painting at the Reformation, and little interest in classical mythology until the very end of the period, the portrait was the most important form of painting for all the artists of the Tudor court, and the only one to have survived in any numbers. How many of these have been also lost can be seen from Holbein's book (nearly all pages in the Royal Collection) containing preparatory drawings for portraits - of eighty-five drawings, only a handful have surviving Holbein paintings, though often copies have survived. Portraiture ranged from the informal miniature, almost invariably painted from life in the course of a few days and intended for private contemplation, to the later large-scale portraits of Elizabeth I such as the \"Rainbow Portrait\", filled with symbolic iconography in dress, jewels, background, and inscription.\n\nMuch energy was also expended on decorative painting of fixtures and fittings, often of a very temporary nature. In theory the \"Serjeant Painters\" of the King, a lower rank of painter, did most of this, probably to the designs of the more elevated \"King's Painters\" (or Queen's), but it is clear that they too spent time on this, as did court artists all over Europe (see Royal Entry). There was also the Master of the Revels, whose Office was responsible for festivals and tournaments, and no doubt called upon the artists and Serjeant Painters for assistance.\n\nJewellery and metalwork were regarded as extremely important, and far more was spent on them than on painting. Holbein produced many spectacular designs for now-vanished table ornaments in precious metals, and Hilliard was also a practising goldsmith. The main artistic interests of Henry VIII were music, building palaces and tapestry, of which he had over 2,000 pieces, costing far more than he ever spent on painters. The Flemish set with the \"Story of Abraham\" still at Hampton Court Palace is one grand set from late in his reign.\n\nElizabeth spent far less, hardly building anything herself, but took a personal interest in painting, keeping her own collection of miniatures locked away, wrapped in paper on which she wrote the names of the sitter. She is reputed to have had paintings of her burnt that did not match the iconic image she wished to be shown.\n\nThe most progressive and spectacular palace of the Tudor period, Nonsuch Palace, begun by Henry VIII in 1538 a little way south of London, was covered inside and out with prodigious quantities of figurative sculpted stucco reliefs - the whole scheme covered over 2,000 square metres (21,000 sq ft). There was also probably much decorative painting. As for the similar work at the Château de Fontainebleau, which Nonsuch was certainly intended to compete with, and outshine, Italians were brought in to provide authentic Mannerist work, however much the general plan remains English. The scattered fragments and images that have survived suggest that the awestruck accounts of visitors were not exaggerated.\n\nMany of the artists active at the Tudor court were connected by ties of family, marriage, and training. Lucas Horenbout (often called Hornebolt in England), who began painting and illuminating for Henry VIII in the mid-1520s, was accompanied in his workshop by his sister Susannah, who was also an illuminator. It is generally accepted that Lucas Horenbout taught Hans Holbein the Younger the techniques of painting miniatures on vellum when Holbein was engaged by Henry VIII in the early 1530s.\n\nLucas and Susanna Horenbout's father, Gerard Horenbout - possibly he was the Master of James IV of Scotland - was an active member of the Ghent-Bruges school of manuscript illustrators and also was employed briefly at the Tudor court. In Bruges, Gerard was associated with Sanders Bening or Benninck and his son Simon, with whom he worked on the illustrations for the Grimani Breviary. Simon Bening's eldest daughter Levina Teerlinc was also trained as an illuminator. She entered the service of Henry VIII at the close of 1546 following the deaths of Holbein (1543) and Lucas Horenbout (1544), and would remain as court painter to Henry's son Edward VI and as painter and lady-in-waiting to both his daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth. Levina Teerlinc, in turn, taught the art of limning to Nicholas Hilliard, an apprentice goldsmith who would marry the daughter of Queen Elizabeth's jeweler and rise to become the supreme miniaturist of the age. John Bettes the Elder apprenticed his son, John the Younger to Hilliard. Hilliard's most famous student, Isaac Oliver, later limner to Anne of Denmark and Henry, Prince of Wales, was married to the niece of Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger. Gheeraerts was also the brother-in-law of Lucas de Heere's apprentice John de Critz the Elder, who took the dynasty into the Stuart period, and was succeeded as Serjeant-Painter by his son. De Heere was also a religious refugee from Flanders; although the upheavals of the Protestant Reformation acted to reduce artistic contacts, especially with Italy, England could also benefit from them.\n\n\n\nThe holders of the office were:\n\n\nMany surviving images have been badly worn over the years, or incompetently \"restored\". Inscriptions are often later than the paintings themselves, and may reflect wishful thinking; many anonymous Tudor ladies were identified as \"Mary I\", or, especially, one or other of Henry VIII's queens, by the owners of pictures. Anne Boleyn in particular has been said to be the subject of dozens of pictures; even now there is no certain image of her done from life, and the most plausible, is a later copy and among the least informative. The only probable portrait of Catherine Howard, a miniature by Holbein in the Royal Collection, is only identified by circumstantial evidence (see Gallery).\n\nA well-known painting (left) was identified by George Vertue in 1727 as Lady Frances Brandon and her second husband Adrian Stokes, an attribution that stood unquestioned until the sitters were properly identified as Mary Nevill, Baroness Dacre and her son Gregory Fiennes, 10th Baron Dacre and the artist as Hans Eworth in 1986.\n\nAttribution to artists is even more challenging; not all artists signed their work, and those who did may not have done so consistently. Many pictures have been cut down, extended, or otherwise altered in ways that damage or destroy inscriptions. Artists' workshops often churned out copies of the master's work to meet the demand for portraits, as symbols of devotion to the Crown or simply to populate the fashionable \"long galleries\" lined with portraits.\n\nToday, attributions are made on the basis of style, sitter, accepted date, and related documentation such as receipts or bills for payment and inventories of collections or estates. It is now generally accepted that the artist known as \"The Monogrammist HE\" is Hans Eworth, but other identifications remain elusive. Some of the most well-known images of the period, such as the portrait of \"Elizabeth I when a Princess\", age 13, have been attributed to many artists over the years, but remain cautiously labelled \"?Flemish School\" in recent catalogues. Much scholarly debate also circles around identification of possible portraits of Lady Jane Grey.\n\nThe royal accounts for the period survive, but are not always easy to interpret. Payments often covered expensive materials, and in many cases the wages of assistants had to be paid out of them. Some regular annuities, usually supplemented by payments for specific works, are given below. But recipients were expected to give works to the monarch, at New Year or on their birthday.\n\nRoyal annuities:\n\nThe sums spent on metalwork, building palaces, and by Henry on tapestries, dwarfed these figures.\n\n"}

Before the merger, Barksdale presented season at two home locations: Barksdale Theatre at Hanover Tavern and Barksdale Theatre at The Shops at Willow Lawn.\nBarksdale is recognized as Central Virginia's leading professional theatre. It continues on as Virginia Repertory Theatre's Barksdale Season at Hanover Tavern under the leadership of Artistic Director Nathaniel Shaw and Managing Director Phil Whiteway.\n\nOn August 1, 1953, six actors, two children, a dog and two pigs moved into a historic ruin called Hanover Tavern. The transplanted New Yorkers founded Central Virginia’s first professional theatre, and named the company in memory of a deceased college friend, Barbara Barksdale. When they learned that their new neighbors looked forward to eating on evenings out, they combined favorite recipes and created the nation’s first dinner theater. They lived upstairs, performed downstairs, and served hearty meals in the historic rooms that fell in between.\n\nDuring the first six years, four of the original founders moved on, leaving Pete Kilgore, Muriel McAuley and newcomer (and newly-wed) Nancy Kilgore firmly in charge. In the seasons that followed, Pete, Muriel and Nancy produced Greater Richmond’s first professional productions of plays by Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Eugene O’Neill, George Bernard Shaw, Noël Coward, Thornton Wilder, William Inge and Edward Albee.\nThey also became dynamic civic leaders. In defiance of Jim Crow laws., Barksdale was Virginia’s first performing arts organization to open its doors to integrated audiences. Barksdale launched Greater Richmond’s first “studio season,” converting an old country store into an experimental theatre. Barksdale conducted Virginia’s first professional theatre classes for children. In 1973, Barksdale produced Virginia’s first professional play based on African American experience, Lorraine Hansberry’s To Be Young, Gifted and Black.\n\nIn support of their theatrical mission, Pete, Muriel and Nancy continued the endless task of restoring the Tavern. In 1990, the Tavern was sold to the Hanover Tavern Foundation. In 1993, Pete, Muriel and Nancy retired after 40 years of exemplary service. John Glenn was named Artistic Director. In 1996, to accommodate a full restoration of its beloved home, Barksdale left the Tavern for new facilities at Willow Lawn. In 1997, John Glenn left to pursue other opportunities, and Randy Strawderman was hired to replace him.\n\nIn 2001, leadership was transferred to Bruce Miller and Phil Whiteway, Artistic Director and Managing Director, respectively. Under their leadership, the company’s reputation for artistic excellence continued to grow.

{"id": "14395146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14395146", "title": "Berlinka (art collection)", "text": "Berlinka (art collection)\n\nThe Berlinka ('Berliner'), also Pruski skarb ('Prussian Treasure'), is the Polish name for a collection of German original manuscripts originally kept at the Prussian State Library in Berlin, which since the end of World War II are held by the Jagiellonian Library in Kraków. The legal status of the documents is subject of an ongoing debate.\n\nDuring the Second World War from September 1942 onwards, German authorities moved the material from Berlin to the seized abbey of Grüssau (present-day Krzeszów) in Prussian Lower Silesia, in order to protect it from Allied strategic bombing. When the Lower Silesian territory east of the Oder–Neisse line fell under the administrative sovereignty of the Republic of Poland after the war, the Polish government secretly claimed the collection as war reparations. In the winter of 1945/1946, the inventories were removed by Polish \"milicja\" and thereafter transferred to Kraków.\n\nIn 1965, the Polish and the East German government signed an agreement on the return of large collections of the Prussian State Library; however, the Polish authorities kept the \"Berlinka\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s existence at the Jagiellonian Library a secret until 1977, when Polish First Secretary Edward Gierek presenting his East German counterpart Erich Honecker with seven pieces of sheet music, including Mozart's original score of \"The Magic Flute\" and Beethoven's notes for his Symphony No. 9, as a gift.\n\nSince the jurisdiction of the former eastern territories of Germany was withdrawn by the 1945 Potsdam Agreement, Poland claims that it should retain ownership of the \"Berlinka\" as compensation for Polish cultural assets destroyed or looted by Germans during the Second World War; the total worth of Polish cultural heritage destroyed by Nazi Germany, especially after the failed Warsaw Uprising in 1944, is estimated at 20 billion dollars. Some German media have referred to the \"Berlinka\" as the \"last German prisoner of war\". The German government claims that Poland is in violation of Article 56 of the Hague Convention of 1907, while the Polish side emphasizes the fact that the collections were not looted, but were situated on Polish territory after the war.\n\nAfter the Revolutions of 1989, the Polish–German Treaty of Good Neighbourship was signed in 1991 and several negotiations have taken place in order to clarify and confirm the whereabouts of the \"Berlinka\". Poland has undertaken several initiatives, such as in 2000 when Foreign Minister Władysław Bartoszewski proposed establishing a Polish–German foundation that would take possession of such disputed collections. However, the German government refused – according to Bartoszewski, resulting from the fact that Chancellor Gerhard Schröder did not realise the offer. While Germany each time is demanding that Poland return the \"Berlinka\" unconditionally, Poland refuses, claiming that Germany still has much Polish material looted during World War II, and that this should be returned to Poland in exchange.\n\nIn summer 2007, \"Der Spiegel\" magazine quoted German Foreign Office representative Julia Gross as saying that proceedings over the disposition had reached a low point. Earlier, Poland had stated that return is out of the question. In 2014 Germany returned to Poland the looted painting \"Palace Stairs\" by Francesco Guardi. With this gesture, Germany hopes to restart negotiations for the return of \"Berlinka\".\n\nThe \"Berlinka\" comprises some of the most valuable holdings of the former Prussian State Library. It includes over 500,000 medieval manuscripts, early modern printings and autographs, including by Luther and Calvin, Goethe and Schiller, Hegel, and Herder. Among the holdings are notable letters from the large estate of Ludmilla Assing and her uncle Karl August Varnhagen von Ense, personal copies of the \"Deutsches Wörterbuch\" with hand-written notes by the Brothers Grimm and original musical scores by Johann Sebastian Bach and his sons, Mozart (\"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\"), Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Schumann, Haydn, Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Paganini, Busoni, Cherubini, and Telemann. On the other hand, the collections also comprise many manuscripts and incunables from Polish monasteries in Gniezno, Lubiń, Mogilno, Pakość, Paradyż, Pelplin and Poznań, removed between 1820 and 1840 by Prussian authorities from the territories gained in the Partitions of Poland.\n\nListed under separate provenance, the collections today are accessible for researchers and post-graduate students only. After a number of incunables from the Jagiellonian Library were found at auctions, user conditions were tightened again in 1999.\n\n\n"}

Before audio recordings, books were made available in braille. Beginning with 19 libraries in 1931, the network as of March 2018 was 55 regional libraries, 32 subregional libraries, and 14 advisory and outreach centers serving the United States and its territories. The program was expanded in 1952 to include blind children, in 1962 to include music materials, and in 1966 to include individuals with physical impairments that prevent the reading of standard print. The Books for the Blind Program was the model for the effort in the 1950s for captioned films for the deaf leading to the Captioned Films Act of 1958.\n\nAudio recordings were first created on vinyl when Pratt-Smoot Act was amended in 1933 to include \"talking books\", and later, in 1969, on proprietary cassette tape and player, becoming the preferred format. Currently, books for the blind and visually impaired can be downloaded from the NLS's Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD) system, which allows for digital books on desktop computers and some mobile devices. In 2016, a \"wi-fi\" symbol was added to the NLS's logo to represent the inclusion of wireless connectivity to the programs.\n\n\n"}

Consisting of fellow Hunter MFA graduates Danielle Mysliwiec, Elaine Kaufmann, and Maria Dumlao, their most well-known work is one where they stood in costume, at the entrance of P.S.1 during the \"Greater New York\" show in 2005, pointing accusingly at the institution for its gender discrimination in its selection of artists.\n\nIn 2005, fellow Hunter MFA graduates, Danielle Mysliwiec, Elaine Kaufmann, Maria Dumlao, Anne Polashenski, and Jane Johnston and four volunteers, stood outside of P.S.1's entrance in a colorful curly wigs, their faces painted and stood pointing directly at the institution, for six hours. \"Point\" was a performance that called attention to the fact of the all-important New York City exhibition's roster of artists being over two-thirds male in a time when the numbers of women in art programs exceeded that of men. The group drew on earlier feminist art protest work of the Guerrilla Girls, with whom they have collaborated. Polashenski and Johnston (the latter a co-founder of the group with Mysliwiec, Kaufmann, and Dumlao) have since left the group.\n\nIn 2005, the Brainstormers performed again, in a piece entitled \"How Good Are You?\" outside the entrance to the Armory Show, dressed in lab coats, handing out color-coded research about the levels of representation of women artists in Chelsea art galleries. The next year Dumlao, Kaufmann, Mysliwiec, and Polashenski published a researched piece entitled \"The Cutting Edge and the Corporate Agenda\" in the international journal \"Women & Environments,\" for its women, art and community activism issue.\n\nIn 2008, the group did a collaborative work with the Guerrilla Girls at the Bronx Museum of Art. Elaine Kaufmann told \"Art News,\" “I think what is really important was that we were ... coming after the Guerrilla Girls, and we were still seeing the same kind of gender discrimination happening in our generation and felt compelled to do something.”\n\nAlso in 2008, the group stationed themselves at the corner of West 24th Street and 10th Avenue in Chelsea, and got passers-by to fill in mad libs-style postcards protesting about the lack of female representation in art galleries. In 2009 they exhibited at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center in New York City.\n\nThe Brainstormers use similar tactics as the Guerrilla Girls, such as Agitprop theatre and shocking statistics.

{"id": "21481572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21481572", "title": "Chick flick", "text": "Chick flick\n\nChick flick is a slang term for the film genre dealing mainly with love and romance which is targeted to a female audience. It can be specifically defined as a genre in which a woman is the protagonist. Although many types of films may be directed toward the female gender, \"chick flick\" is typically used only in reference to films that contain emotion or themes that are relationship-based (although not necessarily romantic as films may focus on parent-child or friend relationships). Chick flicks often are released \"en masse\" around Valentine's Day. The equivalent for male audiences is the guy-cry film. Feminists such as Gloria Steinem have objected to terms such as \"chick flick\" and the related term \"chick lit\", and a film critic has called the term \"chick flick\" derogatory.\n\nGenerally, a chick flick is a film designed to have an innate appeal to women, typically young women. Defining a chick flick is, as \"The New York Times\" has stated, more of a parlor game than a science. These films are generally held in popular culture as having formulaic, paint-by-numbers plot lines and characters. This makes usage of the term \"problematic\" for implying \"frivolity, artlessness, and utter commercialism\", according to ReelzChannel. However, several chick flicks have received high critical acclaim for their stories and performances. For example, the 1983 film \"Terms of Endearment\" received Academy Awards for Best Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Actor in a Supporting Role. More recently, the film \"La La Land\" (called a chick flick in some circles), featuring both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, won Best Actress at the Academy Awards. Both of these actors were well known for their roles in chick flicks before jumping to the academy level.\n\nSome frequent elements of chick flicks include having a female protagonist, thematic use of the color pink (along with metaphorical allusions of the color), and romance and/or dating-based storylines. Longtime producer Jerry Bruckheimer has remarked about the plots, \"How do you cope with money and love?\"\n\nWomen are typically portrayed in chick flicks as sassy, noble victims, or klutzy twentysomethings. Romantic comedies are considered a subgenre of the chick flick. However, romantic comedies are typically respected more than chick flicks because they are designed to appeal to men and women.\n\nFemale MSN.com commentator Kim Morgan has written,\n\nThe term \"chick flick\" was not widely used until the 1980s and 1990s but is reported to have been coined by Brian Callaghan of Montreal, Canada in the mid-1970s while discussing movies with a friend in a schoolyard. It has its roots in the \"women's pictures\" of the early twentieth century, which portrays the woman as a victim and housewife, and later the \"film noir\" of the 1940s and early 1950s, which portrays the threat of sexualized women. In the 1950s, many women who were in the workforce during World War II faced the transition back into the home. Brandon French notes that the women's films of the 1950s \"shed light on a different cluster of issues and situations women faced in their transition from the forties to the sixties: romance, courtship, work, marriage, sex, motherhood, divorce, loneliness, adultery, alcoholism, widowhood, heroism, madness, and ambition.\"\n\nThe 1961 film \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", commonly known as one of the \"classic\" films from the golden age of cinema, is sometimes considered an early chick flick due to common elements such as dealing with loneliness, obsessive materialism, and happy endings. Author Molly Haskell has suggested that chick flicks are very different from the women's films of the 1940s and 1950s in that they now \"sing a different tune.\" She feels that they are \"more defiant and upbeat, post-modern and post-feminist.\"\n\nIn the U.S. in the 1980s, a succession of teenage drama pictures also labeled as chick flicks were released, many by director John Hughes. These often had a different and more realistic tone than previous chick flicks, with dramatic elements such as abortion and personal alienation being included.\n\nSeveral chick flicks have been patterned after the story of Cinderella and other fairy tales (e.g. \"A Cinderella Story\", \"Ever After\", and \"Pretty Woman\"), or even Shakespeare in the case of \"She's the Man\" and \"10 Things I Hate About You\". In addition, a large number are adapted from popular novels (e.g. \"The Princess Diaries\", \"The Devil Wears Prada\") and literary classics (e.g. \"Little Women\"). While most films that are considered chick flicks are lighthearted, some suspense films also fall under this category, such as \"What Lies Beneath\".\n\nAfter the blockbuster success of the 2008 drama/romance film \"Twilight\", Paul Dergarabedian of Media By Numbers remarked, \"[t]he word 'chick flick' is going to have to be replaced by big box-office girl-power flick\" and that \"[t]he box-office clout of the female audience is just astounding, and it's been an underserved audience for way too long\". He also said, \"they have no trouble finding money for the things they're passionate about.\" According to Fandango.com, more than 75% of \"Twilight\" opening-weekend audience was female.\n\nThe term “chick flick” has generated several negative responses from the modern feminist community. Most criticisms of the genre concentrate on the negative consequences that arise from gendering certain interests, in this case film. Author of \"The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory? Feminist? or Both?\", Natalia Thompson, states that chick flicks are “an attempt to lump together an entire gender’s interests into one genre.” While the tailoring of interests may seem helpful and natural, many critics argue that unnecessary gendering can have negative consequences on many different social groups. In fact, there is evidence from Russian social scientist Natal'ia Rimashevskaia that gender stereotypes further perpetuated by the media can lead to discrimination against women and limit their “human and intellectual potential.” More criticisms of the term arise from actual content of the films in the chick flick genre and how the content affects society's perception of women. Some say that chick flicks are micro-aggressions. Micro-aggressions are actions or exchanges that degrade a person based on his or her membership in a \"race, gender, age, and ability.\"\n\nDespite the genre's obvious success, some film critics take issue with the content most chick flicks have in common. Although the subcategories represent different plot lines, all five have several characteristics in common. Many chick flicks can have an \"ironic, self-deprecating tone\", claims film theorist Hilary Radner. This tone is one of the defining characteristics of the genre, and many feel that it lacks substance compared to other genres. Radner also goes on to say the genre is \"incredibly heteronormative and white-washed.\" These common characteristics of the genre can lead to criticism from minority groups and social justice activists. More issues with the genre emerge from the opinion that chick flicks play to every woman's \"patriarchal unconscious.\"\n\nIn her article \"Structural Integrity, Historical Reversion, and the Post-9/11 Chick Flick\", Diane Negra focuses on several romantic comedies, deemed to be chick flicks, set in New York City after the attacks on September 11th, 2001. She claims that the films \"centralize female subjectivity but more compellingly undertake political work to stabilize national identity post-9/11.\" The political and social upheaval following the attacks led to a need for films that show the importance of protecting gender and family norms, or \"ideological boundaries,\" as opposed to the emphasis on \"survivalism\" and \"homeland security,\" used to protect national boundaries, seen in the action films at the time. Juxtaposed with the \"politically innocent\" genre of the pre-9/11 period, the films are rife with political undertones that are meant \"to stabilize national identity post-9/11.\" \n\nWhile the plot of a chick flick is typically expected to be centered around a romantic conquest, Alison Winch (\"We Can Have It All\") writes about films she calls \"girlfriend flicks.\" These movies emphasize the relationships between friends instead of focusing on a love connection, and examples include \"Bride Wars\" and \"Baby Mama\".\n\nAccording to Winch, \n\nWinch also states that girlfriend flicks are meant to criticize \"second wave feminism’s superficial understanding of female solidarity\" by showing \"conflict, pain, and betrayal acted out between women.\" By emphasizing the \"complexities of women's relationships,\" the girlfriend flick breaks the mold for the usual chick flick and allows the genre to gain a bit of depth.\n\n\n"}

Close often paints abstract portraits of himself and others, which hang in collections internationally. Close also creates photo portraits using a very large format camera. Even though a catastrophic spinal artery collapse in 1988 left him severely paralyzed, he has continued to paint and produce work that remains sought after by museums and collectors.\n\nChuck Close was born in Monroe, Washington. His father, Leslie Durward Close, died when Chuck was eleven years old. His mother's name was Mildred Wagner Close. Close suffered, as a child, from a neuromuscular condition that made it difficult to lift his feet and a bout with nephritis that kept him out of school for most of sixth grade. Even when in school, he did poorly due to his dyslexia, which wasn't diagnosed at the time.\n\nMost of his early works are very large portraits based on photographs, using Photorealism or Hyperrealism, of family and friends, often other artists. He suffers from prosopagnosia (face blindness), and has suggested that this condition is what first inspired him to do portraits.\n\nIn an interview with Phong Bui in \"The Brooklyn Rail\", Close describes an early encounter with a Jackson Pollock painting at the Seattle Art Museum: \"I went to the Seattle Art Museum with my mother for the first time when I was 14. I saw this Jackson Pollock drip painting with aluminum paint, tar, gravel and all that stuff. I was absolutely outraged, disturbed. It was so far removed from what I thought art was. However, within 2 or 3 days, I was dripping paint all over my old paintings. In a way I've been chasing that experience ever since.\"\n\nClose attended Everett Community College in 1958–60. Local notable eccentric, author, activist and journalist John Patric was an early anti-establishment intellectual influence on him, and a role model for the iconoclastic and theatric artist's persona Close learned to project in subsequent years.\n\nIn 1962, Close received his B.A. from the University of Washington in Seattle. In 1961, he won a coveted scholarship to the Yale Summer School of Music and Art, and the following year entered the graduate degree program at Yale University, where he received his MFA in 1964. Among Close's classmates at Yale were Brice Marden, Vija Celmins, Janet Fish, Richard Serra, Nancy Graves, Jennifer Bartlett, Robert Mangold, and Sylvia Plimack Mangold.\n\nAfter Yale, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna on a Fulbright grant. When he returned to the US, he worked as an art teacher at the University of Massachusetts. Close came to New York City in 1967 and established himself in SoHo.\n\nThroughout his career, Chuck Close has expanded his contribution to portraiture through the mastery of such varied drawing and painting techniques as ink, graphite, pastel, watercolor, conté crayon, finger painting, and stamp-pad ink on paper; printmaking techniques, such as Mezzotint, etching, woodcuts, linocuts, and silkscreens; as well as handmade paper collage, Polaroid photographs, Daguerreotypes, and Jacquard tapestries. His early airbrush techniques inspired the development of the ink jet printer.\n\nClose had been known for his skillful brushwork as a graduate student at Yale University. There, he emulated Willem de Kooning and seemed \"destined to become a third-generation abstract expressionist, although with a dash of Pop iconoclasm\". After a period in which he experimented with figurative constructions, Close began a series of paintings derived from black-and-white photographs of a female nude, which he copied onto canvas and painted in color. As he explained in a 2009 interview with Cleveland, Ohio's \"The Plain Dealer\" newspaper, he made a choice in 1967 to make art hard for himself and force a personal artistic breakthrough by abandoning the paintbrush. \"I threw away my tools\", Close said. \"I chose to do things I had no facility with. The choice not to do something is in a funny way more positive than the choice to do something. If you impose a limit to not do something you've done before, it will push you to where you've never gone before.\" One photo of Philip Glass was included in his resulting black-and-white series in 1969, redone with watercolors in 1977, again redone with stamp pad and fingerprints in 1978, and also done as gray handmade paper in 1982.\n\nWorking from a gridded photograph, he builds his images by applying one careful stroke after another in multi-colors or grayscale. He works methodically, starting his loose but regular grid from the left hand corner of the canvas. His works are generally larger than life and highly focused. \"One demonstration of the way photography became assimilated into the art world is the success of photorealist painting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is also called super-realism or hyper-realism and painters like Richard Estes, Denis Peterson, Audrey Flack, and Chuck Close often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs. The everyday nature of the subject matter of the paintings likewise worked to secure the painting as a realist object.\"\n\nClose suffers from prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, in which he is unable to recognize faces. By painting portraits, he is better able to recognize and remember faces. On the subject, Close has said, \"I was not conscious of making a decision to paint portraits because I have difficulty recognizing faces. That occurred to me twenty years after the fact when I looked at why I was still painting portraits, why that still had urgency for me. I began to realize that it has sustained me for so long because I have difficulty in recognizing faces.\"\n\nAlthough his later paintings differ in method from his earlier canvases, the preliminary process remains the same. To create his grid work copies of photos, Close puts a grid on the photo and on the canvas and copies cell by cell. Typically, each square within the grid is filled with roughly executed regions of color (usually consisting of painted rings on a contrasting background) which give the cell a perceived 'average' hue which makes sense from a distance. His first tools for this included an airbrush, rags, razor blade, and an eraser mounted on a power drill. His first picture with this method was \"Big Self Portrait\", a black and white enlargement of his face to a canvas, made in over four months in 1968, and acquired by the Walker Art Center in 1969. He made seven more black and white portraits during this period. He has been quoted as saying that he used such diluted paint in the airbrush that all eight of the paintings were made with a single tube of Mars Black acrylic.\n\nHis later work has branched into non-rectangular grids, topographic map style regions of similar colors, CMYK color grid work, and using larger grids to make the cell by cell nature of his work obvious even in small reproductions. The \"Big Self Portrait\" is so finely done that even a full page reproduction in an art book is still indistinguishable from a regular photograph.\n\nOn December 7, 1988, Close felt a strange pain in his chest. That day he was at a ceremony honoring local artists in New York City and was waiting to be called to the podium to present an award. Close delivered his speech and then made his way across the street to Beth Israel Medical Center where he suffered a seizure which left him paralyzed from the neck down. The cause was diagnosed as a spinal artery collapse. He had also suffered from neuromuscular problems as a child. Close called that day \"The Event\". For months, Close was in rehab strengthening his muscles with physical therapy; he soon had slight movement in his arms and could walk, yet only for a few steps. He has relied on a wheelchair ever since. Close spoke candidly about the effect disability had on his life and work in the book \"\" written by Jean Kennedy Smith and George Plimpton and published by Random House.\n\nHowever, Close continued to paint with a brush strapped onto his wrist, creating large portraits in low-resolution grid squares created by an assistant. Viewed from afar, these squares appear as a single, unified image which attempt photo-reality, albeit in pixelated form. Although the paralysis restricted his ability to paint as meticulously as before, Close had, in a sense, placed artificial restrictions upon his hyperrealist approach well before the injury. That is, he adopted materials and techniques that did not lend themselves well to achieving a photorealistic effect. Small bits of irregular paper or inked fingerprints were used as media to achieve astoundingly realistic and interesting results. Close proved able to create his desired effects even with the most difficult of materials to control. Close has made a practice, over recent years, of representing artists who are similarly invested in portraiture, like Cecily Brown, Kiki Smith, Cindy Sherman, and Zhang Huan.\n\nClose has been a printmaker throughout his career, with most of his prints published by Pace Editions, New York. He made his first serious foray into print making in 1972, when he moved himself and family to San Francisco to work on a mezzotint at Crown Point Press for a three-month residency. To accommodate him, Crown Point found the largest copper plate it could (36 inches wide) and purchased a new press, allowing Close to make a work that was 3 feet by 4 feet. In 1986 he went to Kyoto to work with Tadashi Toda, a highly respected woodblock printer.\n\nIn 1995, curator Colin Westerbeck used a grant from the Lannan Foundation to bring Close together with Grant Romer, director of conservation at the George Eastman House. Ever since, the artist has also continued to explore difficult photographic processes such as daguerreotype in collaboration with Jerry Spagnoli and sophisticated modular/cell-based forms such as tapestry. Close's photogravure portrait of artist Robert Rauschenberg, \"Robert\" (1998), appeared in a 2009 exhibition at the Heckscher Museum of Art in Huntington, New York, featuring prints from Universal Limited Art Editions. In the daguerreotype photographs, the background defines the limit of the image plane as well as the outline of the subject, with the inky pitch-black setting off the light, reflective quality of the subject's face.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Terrie Sultan, Close said: \"I've had two great collaborators in the God knows how many years I've been making prints. One was the late Joe Wilfer, who was called the 'prince of pulp' … and now I'm working with Don Farnsworth in Oakland at…Magnolia Editions: I do the watercolor prints with him, I do the tapestries with him. These are the most important collaborations of my life as an artist.\"\n\nSince 2012, Magnolia Editions has published an ongoing series of archival watercolor prints by Close which use the artist's grid format and the precision afforded by contemporary digital printers to layer water-based pigment on Hahnemuhle rag paper such that the native behavior of watercolor is manifested in each print: \"The edges of each pixel bleed with cyan, magenta, and yellow, creating a kind of three-dimensional fog effect behind the intended color swatches.\" The watercolor prints are created using more than 10,000 of Close's hand-painted marks which were scanned into a computer and then digitally rearranged and layered by the artist using his signature grid.\nThese works have been called Close's first major foray into digital imagery: according to Close, \"It's amazing how precise a computer can be working with light and color and water.\" A New York Times review notes that the \"exaggerated breakdown of the image, particularly when viewed at close range,\" that characterizes Close's work \"is also apparent in... [watercolor print] portraits of the artists Cecily Brown, Kiki Smith, Cindy Sherman, Kara Walker and Zhang Huan.\"\n\nClose's wall-size tapestry portraits, in which each image is composed of thousands of combinations of woven colored thread, depict subjects including Kate Moss, Cindy Sherman, Lorna Simpson, Lucas Samaras, Philip Glass, Lou Reed, Roy Lichtenstein, and Close himself. They are produced in collaboration with Donald Farnsworth. Although many are translated from black-and-white daguerreotypes, all of the tapestries use multiple colors of thread. No printing is involved in their creation; colors and values appear to the viewer based on combinations of more than 17,800 colored warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads, in an echo of Close's typical grid format. Close's tapestry series began with a 2003 black-and-white portrait of Philip Glass. In August 2013 he debuted two color self-portraits at Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, New York. Reviewing this exhibition, Marion Weiss writes: \"Close's Jacquard tapestries are not obviously fragmented, but are created by repeating multicolor warp and weft threads that are optically blended. Thus, portraits of Lou Reed and Roy Lichtenstein, for example, seem 'whole.' It's only when we get closer that we see the individual threads, which are woven together.\"\n\nIn 2010, Close was commissioned by MTA Arts & Design to create twelve large mosaics, totaling more than , for the 86th Street subway station on the New York City Subway's Second Avenue Line in Manhattan.\n\n\"Vanity Fair's\" 20th Annual Hollywood edition in March 2014 featured a portfolio of 20 Polaroid portraits of movie stars shot by Close, including Robert De Niro, Scarlett Johansson, Helen Mirren, Julia Roberts and Oprah Winfrey. Close requested that his subjects be ready to be photographed without makeup or hair-styling and used a large-format 20x24\" Polaroid camera for the close-ups.\n\nA fragment of Close's portrait of singer-songwriter Paul Simon was used as the cover art for his 2016 album \"Stranger to Stranger\". The right eye appears on the cover; the entire portrait is in the liner notes.\n\nClose donated an original print of his \"Self Portrait\" in 2002 to the public library in Monroe, Washington, his hometown.\n\nClose's first solo exhibition, held in 1967 at the University of Massachusetts Art Gallery, Amherst, featured paintings, painted reliefs, and drawings based on photographs of record covers and magazine illustrations. The exhibition captured the attention of the university administration which promptly closed it, citing the male nudity as obscene. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) came to the defense of Close and a landmark court case ensued. A Massachusetts Supreme Court Justice decided in favor of the artist against the university. When the university appealed Close chose not to return to Boston, and ultimately the decision was overturned by an appeals court. (Close was later awarded an Honorary Doctorate of the Arts by the University of Massachusetts in 1995.)\n\nClose credits the Walker Art Center and its then-director Martin Friedman for launching his career with the purchase of \"Big Self-Portrait\" (1967–1968) in 1969, the first painting he sold His first one-man show in New York was in 1970 at Bykert Gallery. His first print was the focus of a \"Projects\" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1972. In 1979 his work was included in the Whitney Biennial and the following year his portraits were the subject of an exhibition at the Walker Art Center. His work has since been the subject of more than 150 solo exhibitions including a number of major museum retrospectives. After Close abruptly canceled a major show of his work scheduled for 1997 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art announced that it would present a major midcareer retrospective of the artist's work in 1998 (curated by Kirk Varnedoe and later traveling to the Hayward Gallery, London, and other galleries in 1999). In 2003 the Blaffer Gallery at the University of Houston presented a survey of his prints, which travelled to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the following year. His most recent retrospective – \"Chuck Close Paintings: 1968 / 2006\", at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid in 2007 – travelled to the Ludwig Forum für Internationale Kunst in Aachen, Germany, and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. He has also participated in almost 800 group exhibitions, including documentas V (1972) and VI (1977), the Venice Biennale (1993, 1995, 2003), and the Carnegie International (1995).\n\nIn 2013, Close's work was featured in an exhibit in White Cube Bermondsey, London. \"Process and Collaboration\" displayed not only a number of finished prints and paintings but included plates, woodblocks, and mylar stencils which were used to produce a number of prints.\n\nIn December 2014 his work was exhibited in Australia at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney, which he visited.\n\nIn 2016, Close's work was the subject of a retrospective at the Schack Art Center in Everett, Washington, where he attended high school and community college.\n\nClose's work is in the collections of most of the great international museums of contemporary art, including the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Tate Modern in London, and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis who published \"Chuck Close: Self-Portraits 1967–2005\" coauthored with curators Siri Engberg and Madeleine Grynsztejn.\n\nThe recipient of the National Medal of Arts from President Bill Clinton in 2000, the New York State Governor's Art Award, and the Skowhegan Arts Medal, among many others, Close has received over 20 honorary degrees including one from Yale University, his alma mater. In 1990, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician, and became a full Academician in 1992. New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appointed the artist to the Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission, a body mandated by the City Charter to advise the mayor and the cultural affairs commissioner. Close painted President Clinton in 2006 and photographed President Barack Obama in 2012. In 2010 he was appointed by Obama to the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. He resigned from the President's Committee in August 2017, co-signing a letter of resignation that said in reference to President Donald Trump, \"Ignoring your hateful rhetoric would have made us complicit in your words and actions.\"\n\nIn 2005, composer Philip Glass wrote a musical portrait of Close. The composition, a 15-minute piece for solo piano, was the idea of Bruce Levingston, a concert pianist, who commissioned it through the Premiere Commission and who performed the piece at a recital at Alice Tully Hall that year.\n\nClose has been represented by The Pace Gallery (in New York City) since 1977, and by White Cube (in London) since 1999. Already in 1999, Close's \"Cindy II\" (1988), a portrait of the photographer Cindy Sherman sold for $1.2 million, against a high estimate of $800,000. In 2005, \"John\" (1971–72) was sold at Sotheby's to the Broad Art Foundation for $4.8 million.\n\nClose lives and works in Bridgehampton, New York and Long Beach, NY (both on the south shore of Long Island) and New York City's East Village. He has two daughters with Leslie Rose. They divorced in 2011. Close married artist Sienna Shields in 2013. They later divorced.\n\nOn December 20, 2017, two women accused Close of sexual misconduct, claiming he made vulgar comments to them after inviting them to his studio to pose for him. In response to the accusations, Close issued an apology to \"The New York Times\", saying \"If I embarrassed anyone or made them feel uncomfortable, I am truly sorry, I didn't mean to.\" The National Gallery of Art cancelled a Chuck Close exhibition, planned to open May 2018, because of the accusations of sexual misconduct that have engulfed the artist in controversy.\n\nIn 2007 Close was honored by the New York Stem Cell Foundation and donated artwork for an exclusive online auction.\n\nIn September 2012 Magnolia Editions published two tapestry editions and three print editions by Close depicting President Barack Obama. The first tapestry was unveiled at the Mint Museum in North Carolina in honor of the Democratic National Convention. These tapestries and prints were sold as a fundraiser to support the Obama Victory Fund. A number of the works were signed by both Close and Obama. Close has previously sold work at auction to raise funds for the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Al Gore.\n\nIn October 2013, Close donated a watercolor print of Genevieve Bahrenburg and a watercolor print self-portrait to ARTWALK NY, a cause that benefits the Coalition for the Homeless. In the same year work by Close was also sold to benefit the Lunchbox Fund.\n\nClose was one of eight artists who volunteered in 2013 to participate in President Barack Obama's Turnaround Arts initiative, which aims to improve low-performing schools by increasing student \"engagement\" through the arts. Close mentored 34 students in the sixth through eighth grades at Roosevelt School in Bridgeport, Connecticut, one of eight schools in the nation to participate in this public-private partnership developed in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Education and the White House Domestic Policy Council. Close was honored by mayor Bill Finch with a key to the city at the November 7 reception at the Housatonic Community College Museum of Art, where five of Close's watercolor prints were exhibited alongside artwork by students participating in the program.\n\nIn 1998, PBS broadcast documentary filmmaker Marion Cajori's Emmy-nominated short, \"Chuck Close: A Portrait in Progress.\" In 2007, Cajori made \"Chuck Close\", a full-length expansion of the first film. British art critic Christopher Finch wrote a biography, \"Chuck Close: Life\", which was published in 2010, a sequel of sorts to Finch's 2007 book, \"Chuck Close: Work\", a career-spanning monograph.\n\nClose appeared on \"The Colbert Report\" on August 12, 2010, where he admitted he watches the show every night.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26151615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26151615", "title": "Darío Suro", "text": "Darío Suro\n\nDarío Antonio Suro García-Godoy (June 13, 1917, La Vega – January 18, 1997, Santo Domingo) was an art critic, diplomat and painter from the Dominican Republic. He was the nephew of painter Enrique García-Godoy, his first art teacher. Along with Yoryi Morel and Jaime Colson, he is considered one of the founders of the modernist school of Dominican painting.\n\nBorn to Jaime Vicente Suro Sánchez (born in 1890, in Utuado, Puerto Rico) and Isabel Emilia García-Godoy Ceara (born in 1883 to and Rosa Ceara Giménez). He had a brother, Rubén Antonio (1916-2006).\n\nEarly on, he became popular as an Impressionist landscape artist, often painting horses and rainy scenes of the Cibao region of his country. Suro had his first solo exhibition in 1938 at the Ateneo Dominicano in Santo Domingo. Subsequently, the same exhibition was shown at the San Cristobal Ateneo and in 1939, he was included in group exhibitions in New York City, at the Riverside Museum and the Dominican Republic Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair.\n\nIn 1940, Suro participated in the Inter-American Exhibition of the Caribbean organized by the Organization of American States. In that same year, he participated in a group show at the Ateneo Dominicano in Santo Domingo. In 1942, he had a solo exhibition at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santo Domingo.\n\nThe following year, 1943, he married Maruxa Franco Fernandez of Santiago and shortly after, they departed for Mexico where he was named cultural attaché at the Dominican Republic Embassy in that country. On the way, they stayed in Havana for several weeks, where his bride's cousin, Tomas Hernandez Franco, was the Dominican Consul General to that city. Here he met with the young art critic José Gómez-Sicre, whom he had encountered previously in Santo Domingo. Later they would renew their friendship in Washington, D.C., where Gómez-Sicre was the founder and director of the Art Museum of the Americas, which was established in 1976 by the O.A.S. Permanent Council. While in Havana, Suro also met and befriended important modern artists such as Fidelio Ponce, Carlos Enríquez and Amelia Peláez.\n\nFinally arriving in Mexico after their fascinating Cuban \"sejour\", Suro had a very busy schedule. In addition to his duties as attaché, he enrolled at Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \"La Esmeralda\", where he studied art for nearly four years with some of the most prestigious artists in contemporary Mexico, including Diego Rivera, Agustín Lazo, Jesús Guerrero Galván and Manuel Rodríguez Lozano.\n\nSuro soon befriended some of the most prominent people in Mexico City, which was a great cultural center at the time, including the philosopher Alfonso Reyes, the art historian and critic Justino Fernández, painters María Izquierdo and Angelina Beloff (the first wife of Rivera), and writer and critic Agustín Velázquez Chávez. He also met José Clemente Orozco, Frida Kahlo, Lupe Marin and José Vasconcelos, who would play a crucial role in Suro's career. In 1944, he received word that he had won the Second Prize (Silver Medal) at the Second National Fine Arts Biennial in Santo Domingo. Two years later he won First Prize (Gold Medal) at the Third National Fine Arts Biennial.\n\nSuro's time in Mexico had a dramatic impact on his work. Moving away from a harmonious palette and depictions of pleasant, often melancholy, genre scenes that made him popular with his countrymen, he opted for something more bold and jarring. Influenced by the Mexican nationalistic spirit that embraced all things ethnic, Suro created a related Dominican vision heretofore unseen, a new kind of painting called \"Negroide\", which had its counterpart in Dominican literature of the time, namely in the poetry of his brother Rubén Suro (\"Poemas De Una Sola Intencion\"). Directly addressing multiracial issues (an obvious component of Dominican reality) through graphic images, was indeed a new approach in a nation where whitewashing was often the norm. Many Dominicans liked to think that their heritage derived exclusively from Spain, forgetting their important African legacy. Suro's take was confrontational and challenging, using imagery that made some of his countrymen uncomfortable.\n\nIn 1946, he was included in a group show at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. The following year, he had a solo exhibition at the institution, an event that was widely publicized in the city, bringing him recognition from some of the most important art critics but perhaps leading to his downfall with his own government. His embassy job was suddenly terminated. Before he knew it, he was on a plane with his family going back home where he would be facing an uncertain future. Suro was told by unofficial sources that Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo was not happy with the attention his cultural attaché had received in Mexico.\n\nUpon his return to Santo Domingo, Suro and his wife were warmly greeted by family and friends, while others, especially some who were close to Trujillo, kept a certain distance. The fall from grace was short lived.\n\nVasconcelos, his friend from Mexico, who happened to arrive in Santo Domingo on an official visit and raved to Trujillo about the recently repatriated diplomat and painter, calling him \"brilliant\", and strongly urging the Dominican leader to name Suro Director of Fine Arts of the nation. This happened in early 1947 and once again Suro was celebrated. That same year, he had a successful solo exhibition at the National Palace of Fine Arts in Santo Domingo, showing works that were shown in Mexico with a few recent Dominican additions. Overall, Dominicans were greatly impressed by a new dynamic vision of their nation forged in Mexico by a young Dominican.\n\nAs Director of Fine Arts, Suro was once again in the spotlight, receiving distinguished guests, including Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin and groups like the celebrated \"Coros y Danzas\" from Spain. He was responsible for overseeing new exhibitions at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and setting up cultural programs. He also gave lectures covering a wide range of themes, like the one on his friend José Clemente Orozco, \"La Muerte de Orozco\", which he gave at the Instituto Dominico Americano in Santo Domingo. In 1948, he participated in the 4th National Biennial of Fine Arts.\n\nDuring this same period, the Suro family underwent dramatic, painful changes. His son, Jaime, died suddenly shortly before his second birthday. This event became an obsessive recurring leitmotif in several of his paintings. Depicting the dead child becomes a kind of catharsis in those canvases; the native Baquiní ritual of burying children becomes an important point of identity for the artist. In 1948, his son Federico was born and the following year his daughter Rosa.\n\nIn 1950, Suro's life changed once again when he was sent to Spain as cultural attaché of the Dominican Republic. Arriving with his family in Madrid, Suro befriended some of the most outstanding Spanish artists of that time, including Antonio Saura, Antoni Tàpies, Manolo Millares, and Jose Caballero (\"Pepe\"). Caballero was a close friend of Federico García Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Luis Buñuel and others. Suro was also able to see the great art of Spain, including works by his personal favorites Velázquez, El Greco and Goya.\n\nLiving in Spain also facilitated extensive travel to other European cities, including Paris, London and Amsterdam. He especially loved Italy, and was particularly impressed by the works of Piero della Francesca.\n\nCombining diplomacy and art as he had in Mexico, Suro participated in group exhibitions in Madrid and Barcelona, as well as faraway places like San Francisco (Legion of Honor) and Pittsburgh (Carnegie Institute). He was invited to participate in the Salón de los Once in 1951, along with ten other artists, a venue organized by the philosopher Eugeni d'Ors. The same year, he participated in the First Hispano-American Biennial, which was exhibited in Madrid and Barcelona. He represented the Dominican Republic in several important congresses (including the Congreso de la Cooperacion Intellectual Latino Americano—1952) while continuing his travels throughout the Iberian Peninsula and several other European nations.\n\nIn terms of his artistic development, Spain had a significant impact. This is where Suro painted his first abstract canvases, influenced by European trends.\n\nAs in Mexico, his busy professional life came to an abrupt end. His job was suddenly terminated, without any explanation. Upon arrival in Santo Domingo the same scenario was repeated that they experienced upon their return from Mexico. The Suros heard gossip about the termination of his job and a close friend, who happened to be related to Trujillo's wife, recommended that they leave the country. Leaving the country in that era was not simple. Both Dario and Maruxa were interrogated, but in a fairly short time they were on their way to New York City in 1953. Their children joined them the following year.\n\nSuro's New York City experience would be decidedly different from his Mexico City and Madrid years. With limited English, the couple had a difficult time adjusting to the metropolis. His wife immediately found work as a seamstress in a factory. Suro, however had a harder time. Visiting several establishments that hired artists to do fairly routine work, he soon realized that there was little demand. He finally found a job on 23rd Street, in a factory where artists painted porcelain, screens and other objects. They were given models to work from, with a limited freedom of artistic expression.\n\nNevertheless, Suro explored the New York City art scene. He started contacting dealers and gallery owners, including Rose Fried, Betty Parsons and Leo Castelli.\n\nAs an art critic, Suro wrote the first in-depth critical articles on both Piet Mondrian and Stuart Davis in the Spanish language. He reintroduced the work of Joaquín Torres García to the artists within the Rose Fried Gallery circle, where he was asked to write the text of an accompanying monograph for Torres Garcia's 1960 breakthrough exhibition.\n\nAmong the artists befriended by Suro in New York City were Fritz Glarner, Ronnie Elliott, Jean Arp, Stuart Davis, Adolf Fleischmann, Minna Citron, Bud Hopkins, Burgoyne Diller, Philip Guston, Charmion von Wiegand, John Grillo, Jean Xceron, Judith Rothschild, Lil Picard, Esteban Vicente, Raymond Hendler, John Hultberg and Lynne Drexler.\n\nIn spite of his busy schedule, working in the factory and painting at home, he wrote for many international publications, including the Paris-based \"Aujourd'hui\" and the Madrid-based \"Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos\", and he was a frequent contributor at \"El Caribe\" and other newspapers in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThrough his job, he met Herman Somberg, one of his coworkers who was a quintessential New Yorker and a talented artist who happened to be a close friend of Franz Kline. After a certain reluctance, the latter finally agreed to meet Suro and the two became fast friends (later Suro reminisced about the encounter and ensuing friendship in an article written for \"Americas Magazine\" \"Franz Kline Freedom and Space\" in 1969). He frequented the Cedar Tavern in Manhattan, which he later called \"one of the great universities of my life\" and the place where he drank seriously along with his growing number of acquaintances. Another special friend was Philip Guston, who was fluent in Spanish.\n\nMany of the friends that he met early on through Fried were part of the Neo-Plasticist world. Fritz Glarner had been a close friend of Mondrian, a kindred spirit and the man who photographically documented Mondrian's New York City studio. One of Suro's most intriguing friends was the German Dadaist poet, writer and drummer Richard Huelsenbeck who was also a psychiatrist who went by the name Charles R. Hulbeck. As in Mexico and Spain, Suro changed his style once again, expressing himself through geometric abstract images and eventually going on to works that were decidedly informal and expressionistic.\n\nHe participated in group shows at the Rose Fried Gallery, including the International Collage Exhibition in 1956. Barbara Guest, covering this show for \"Arts Magazine\", observed, \"Suro has carried the Dada idea along, with a frank assemblage of numbers which would have delighted le grand maitre Picabia\". Suro also participated in many group shows, including the \"International Avant Garde Perspectives\" at the Newport Art Association in 1959.\n\nHe finally had a solo exhibition at the Poindexter Gallery, in Manhattan, in 1962. The new paintings were both a reflection of his American experience, as well as his lifelong obsession with Spain several paintings were entitled \"Tauromaquia\", Suro's homage to Goya. Unfortunately, the exhibition coincided with a major newspaper strike and Suro did not receive a normal press coverage. John Gruen, in the \"New York Herald Tribune\", among the few periodicals that covered the event, wrote: \"A Dominican artist who has shown extensively in Europe but not previously here offers oils and collages in intensely muted colors flavored with textual elements reminiscent of the Spanish concern with the \"earth\". They are strong, bold and terse\". Suro received a congratulatory letter from his old friend Vela Zanetti, who visited the exhibition and was both impressed and surprised by the new paintings. The art magazines had overall positive comments as well.\n\nIn 1961, events in his homeland once again changed his life. Trujillo was assassinated. Juan Bosch, Suro's childhood friend, was elected President of the Dominican Republic in 1962 and named Suro the cultural attaché at the Embassy of the Dominican Republic in Washington, D.C., as well as the Organization of American States (OAS). Suro remained in these posts for most of the rest of his life. Washington did not offer the same artistic stimulus as New York City, but his new job was more comfortable and better-paying.\n\nSuro continued painting and exhibiting worldwide into his old age. His painting went through new phases, constantly changing. In his last decade, he revisited old themes, often combining them and coming up with something new in the process. He also continued writing, frequently contributing to \"Americas Magazine\", several Dominican Republic publications, including \"Ahora\" and \"Listin Diario\", as well as international ones, including \"Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos\" and \"Acento Cultural\". He was promoted from cultural attaché to Counselor (1965) to Minister Counselor (1967) to Minister Plenipotentiary, Deputy Chief of Mission (1970) and finally Adjunct Ambassador, Alternate Representative (1980).\n\nIn October 1996, he returned to the Dominican Republic with his wife. He was hoping to concentrate on his art, developing new ideas for paintings inspired by shadows; however, he died the following January. His funeral was attended by many friends, as well as Dominican dignitaries; three former Dominican presidents were present Salvador Jorge Blanco, Donald Reid Cabral and Juan Bosch who told the Suro family \"Dario Suro was not only a great artist, he was a great Dominican\".\n\nSuro was the first artist to receive \"El Premio Nacional de Artes Plasicas\" of the Dominican Republic in 1993, which was presented to him by President Joaquín Balaguer. The \"Orden de Duarte, Sanchez y Mella\" medal was presented posthumously to his widow by President Leonel Fernández in 1999.\n\nA comprehensive retrospective, \"Dario Suro 1917–1997: Metamorfosis y Transmigracones\", was organized at the Centro Cultural de Espana in Santo Domingo, curated by Ricardo Ramon Jarnes, Laura Gil and Marianne de Tolentino in 2001. The 4th Caribbean Biennial (2002), dedicated to Suro, was organized by Sara Herman, Director of the National Gallery of Modern Art of the Dominican Republic; Ricardo Ramon Jarnes and Laura Gil curated an accompanying retrospective exhibition. President Hipólito Mejía and Vice President Milagro Ortiz Bosch opened this biennial.\n\nIn 1981, Suro assessed his approach to art in the following manner: \"I have always been motivated by the existential condition of an object and not by the development of a style.\" More recently, art historian and critic Alejandro Anreus, who often wrote about Suro, offered a more complete summary of his multifaceted career as follows. \"Stylistically, Suro transformed the social realism of the Mexican muralists into a neo-realist aesthetic charged with an existential view of tragedy. By the 1950s he had already painted in a kind of pre-Pop Art when he completed his numeric series, and in the 1960s his abstract expressionist phase was a highly original one where the stain, more than the gesture, was his proffered mark-making strategy, while his palette was evocative of 17th century Spanish painting. His erotic period (1970s) culminated in an obsessive calligraphic use of thin, transparent layers of paint, where lines constructed the female sexual forms as pulsating, fully empowered entities with a life of their own. His body of work before his death was a fierce expressionism, where both the human and landscape forms were torn and reconstructed.\"\n\n"}

John and Lydia Ann (Taylor) Dunjee. Her father was an alumnus of Storer College, a preacher and teacher, working at what was then a normal school under the auspices of the Baptist Missionary Association. Drusilla was sent to finishing school in the North and studied classical piano at the Northwestern Conservatory of Music in Minnesota. Of her nine siblings, only Roscoe, Irving, Blanche, and Ella survived to adulthood. \n\nIn 1892 the family moved to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Territory, where their father was assigned by the Baptists. From 1892 to 1898, Dunjee taught kindergarten and elementary school in Oklahoma City.\n\nIn 1899 she eloped with Price Houston. They settled in McAlester, Oklahoma, in what was still Indian Territory. The state was admitted to the Union in 1908. There Houston founded McAlester Seminary for Girls, leading it for 12 years. She was hired by the Baptists in 1917 to serve as principal of the Oklahoma Baptist College for Girls, and moved to Sapulpa, Oklahoma. She served as principal for six years. \n\nWhen Houston returned to Oklahoma City after this, she started the Oklahoma Vocational Institute of Fine Arts and Crafts. After 1934 Houston served as religious director of the Oklahoma Home for Delinquent Boys. \n\nHer father had died in 1903, causing her mother and younger siblings to struggle financially; her younger brother, Roscoe Dunjee, took on a good part of supporting them. First he expanded their family farm to produce vegetables and other produce for sale. Irving Dunjee left Oklahoma for Chicago and New York City, where he worked in journalism, becoming managing editor of the \"Chicago Enterprise\" and editor of \"The Negro Champion\", respectively in those two cities. \n\nIn 1915 her brother Roscoe Dunjee had founded the \"Oklahoma Black Dispatch\", the first black newspaper in Oklahoma City or the state. Houston had joined him in writing for the newspaper even before she returned to the city, serving as a contributing editor and columnist. \n\nHouston became an independent historian. Beginning in 1901, she conducted research into a variety of sources and published a multi-volume history of Africans in their homeland, \"Wonderful Ethiopians of the Ancient Cushite Empire\" (1926). While the work is now dated, it was influential as part of an early 20th-century effort by African Americans in the United States to document their African ancestors as peoples with complex, ancient history and civilizations.\n\nHouston was a co-founder of Oklahoma chapters of the YWCA, the Red Cross, and the NAACP, all based in Oklahoma City.

{"id": "430787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=430787", "title": "Federal Writers' Project", "text": "Federal Writers' Project\n\nThe Federal Writers' Project (FWP) was a United States federal government project created to provide jobs for out-of-work writers during the Great Depression. It was part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a New Deal program. It was one of a group of New Deal arts programs known collectively as Federal Project Number One.\n\nFunded under the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, the Federal Writers' Project was established July 27, 1935, by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Henry Alsberg, a journalist, playwright, theatrical producer, and human rights activist, directed the program from 1935-1939. In 1939 Alsberg was fired, federal funding was cut, and the Project fell under state sponsorship, led by John D. Newsom, until the FWP ended completely in 1943. The FWP produced thousands of publications over its existence including state guides, city guides, local histories, oral histories, ethnographies, children's books, and other works. In addition to writers, the Project provided jobs to unemployed librarians, clerks, researchers, editors, historians, and others. It's been estimated that over ten-thousand people found employment in the FWP. The Federal Writers' Project set out not only to provide work relief for unemployed writers, but to create a unique \"self-portrait of America\" through publication of guidebooks.\n\n\"The American Guide series,\" the most well-known of the FWP's publications, consisted of guides to the then 48 states, as well as the Alaska Territory, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C. The books were written and compiled by writers from individual states and territories, and edited by Alsberg and his staff in Washington, D.C. The format was generally uniform, and each guide included detailed histories of the state or territory, with descriptions of every city and town, automobile travel routes, photographs, maps, and chapters on natural resources, culture, and geography. The inclusion of essays about the various cultures of people living in the states, including immigrants and African Americans, was unprecedented. City books, such as \"The New York City Guide\", were also published as part of the series. Some full-length books are available online at the Internet Archive. The FWP also published another series, \"Life In America\", as well as numerous individual titles. Many FWP books were bestsellers. Others, like \"Cape Cod Pilot\", written by author Josef Berger using the pseudonym Jeremiah Digges, received critical acclaim.\n\nIn each state a Writers' Project non-relief staff of editors was formed, along with a much larger group of field workers drawn from local unemployment rolls. The people hired came from a variety of backgrounds, ranging from former newspaper workers to white-collar and blue-collar workers without writing or editing experience.\n\nNotable projects of the Federal Writers' Project included the Slave Narrative Collection, a set of interviews that culminated in over 2,300 first-person accounts of slavery and 500 black-and-white photographs of former slaves. Many of these narratives are available online from the above-named collection at the Library of Congress website. Folklorist Benjamin A. Botkin was instrumental in insuring the survival of these manuscripts. Among the researchers and authors who have used this collection are Colson Whitehead for his Pulitzer-Prize winning novel, \"The Underground Railroad\".\n\nOther programs that emerged from Alsberg's desire to create an inclusive \"self-portrait of America\" were the Life History and Folklore Projects. These consisted of first-person narratives and interviews (collected and conducted by FWP workers) which represented people of various ethnicites, regions and occupations. According to the Library Congress website, American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936 to 1940, the documents \"chronicle vivid life stories of Americans who lived at the turn of the century and include tales of meeting Billy the Kid, surviving the 1871 Chicago fire, pioneer journeys out West, grueling factory work, and the immigrant experience. Writers hired by this Depression-era work project included Ralph Ellison, Nelson Algren, May Swenson, and many others.\"\n\nThe Illinois Writers' Project, represented one of the few racially integrated Project sites. The Chicago project employed Arna Bontemps, an established voice of the Harlem Renaissance, and helped to launch the literary careers of African American writers such as Richard Wright, Margaret Walker, Katherine Dunham, and Frank Yerby (Mangione 1972). The Virginia Negro Studies Project employed 16 African American writers and culminated in the publication of \"The Negro in Virginia (1940).\" Notably, it included photographs by Robert McNeill, now remembered as a groundbreaking African American photographer. The unpublished works of African American writer Zora Neale Hurston, who was employed by the Florida Writers' Project, was compiled years after her death in \"Go Gator and Muddy the Water: Writings by Zora Neale Hurston from the Federal Writers' Project\".\n\nFor most of its lifetime, the Federal Writers' Project faced a barrage of criticism from conservatives. When \"Massachusetts: A Guide to Its Places and People\", was published, it was lauded by government officials, including Governor Charles Hurley. But the day after its publication, \"conservatives attacked the book over its essays on the 1912 Lawrence textile strike and other labor issues. Even more sacrilegious to these critics was the coverage of the Sacco and Vanzetti affair.\" Scholars called the questionable passages \"fair accounts;\" ironically, the controversy helped increase book sales.\n\nThe most poisonous attacks against the FWP came from the House Committee on Un-American Activities (commonly known as HUAC) and its chair, the media-savvy Congressman Martin Dies Jr. of Texas. Alsberg and Hallie Flanagan, his counterpart at the Federal Theatre Project, faced tremendous scrutiny from the committee. The Dies HUAC committee, like the McCarthy committee of the 1950s, \"used inquisitorial scare tactics, innuendo, and unsupported accusations.\" Alsberg, Flanagan and others who were accused of supporting the communist agenda could not \"examine evidence against them, could not produce their own witnesses, could not cross-examine accusers.\" Accusations that communist activities were carried out openly, and that Soviets funded labor unions which then took control of the arts' projects, were found to be false. Future Guggenheim scholar and author Richard Wright was often under attack, with his writings pronounced as \"vile.\" (Rubenstein, p. 202.) Among the many charges leveled against the FWP and its members, was that Richard Wright was not born in the United States. (He was born in Mississippi.) Alsberg wrote a long court brief and provided supporting documents to refute each charge.\nSupport for the FWP came from Eleanor Roosevelt, as well as mainstream publishing companies such as Viking Press, Random House, and Alfred Knopf, which produced some of the books. Americans continued to purchase \"American Guide\" books throughout this period. By 1939, HUAC's tactics seemed to work, and the newly elected Congress cut $150,000 million from WPA budget while quadrupling HUAC's funding. In January 1939, 6,000 people were laid off from Federal One. By July 1939, Congress voted to eliminate the Theatre Project. Federal sponsorship for the Federal Writers' Project came to an end in 1939, although the program was permitted to continue under state sponsorship, with some federal employees, until 1943. In the last months of the FWP's existence, Henry Alsberg was fired. He continued to work past his firing date in order to meet contractual arrangements with the publishers of three upcoming \"American Guide\" books. By the time of his departure in 1939, the FWP had published 321 publications; hundreds more remained in various stages of publications. Some were published in the years leading up to 1943 under the renamed Writer's Program. Others were never completed. Over the lifetime of the FWP and the Writer's Program, it is estimated that 10,000 people were employed. (Rubenstein, p. 221.)\n\nA National Endowment for the Humanities-funded documentary about the Federal Writers' Project, entitled \"Soul of a People: Writing America's Story\" premiered on the Smithsonian Channel in September 2009. The film includes interviews with notable American authors Studs Terkel, Stetson Kennedy, and popular American historian Douglas Brinkley. The companion book was published by Wiley & Sons as \"Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America\".\n\nThe Slave Narratives are represented by the HBO documentary, \"Unchained Memories: Readings from the Slave Narratives\". This program features well-known actors such as Angela Bassett and Samuel L. Jackson performing dramatic readings of the transcripts.\n\nThe 1999 film \"Cradle Will Rock\", by Tim Robbins, while depicting the events of the Federal Theatre Project (FTP), dramatizes the attacks against Federal One (via the House Committee on Un-American Activities) which helped shutter both the FTP and the FWP.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1156687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1156687", "title": "Hakuin Ekaku", "text": "Hakuin Ekaku\n\nHakuin was born in 1686 in the small village of Hara, at the foot of Mount Fuji. His mother was a devout Nichiren Buddhist, and it is likely that her piety was a major influence on his decision to become a Buddhist monk. As a child, Hakuin attended a lecture by a Nichiren monk on the topic of the Eight Hot Hells. This deeply impressed the young Hakuin, and he developed a pressing fear of hell, seeking a way to escape it. He eventually came to the conclusion that it would be necessary to become a monk.\n\nAt the age of fifteen, he obtained consent from his parents to join the monastic life, and was ordained at the local Zen temple, Shōin-ji. When the head monk at Shōin-ji took ill, Hakuin was sent to a neighboring temple, Daishō-ji, where he served as a novice for three or four years, studying Buddhist texts. While at Daisho-ji, he read the Lotus Sutra, considered by the Nichiren sect to be the king of all Buddhist sutras, and found it disappointing, saying \"it consisted of nothing more than simple tales about cause and effect\".\n\nAt age eighteen, he left Daishō-ji for Zensō-ji, a temple close to Hara. At the age of nineteen, he came across in his studies the story of the Chinese Ch'an master Yantou Quanhuo, who had been brutally murdered by bandits. Hakuin despaired over this story, as it showed that even a great monk could not be saved from a bloody death in this life. How then could he, just a simple monk, hope to be saved from the tortures of hell in the next life? He gave up his goal of becoming an enlightened monk, and not wanting to return home in shame, traveled around studying literature and poetry.\n\nTravelling with twelve other monks, Hakuin made his way to Zuiun-ji, the residence of Baō Rōjin, a respected scholar but also a tough-minded teacher. While studying with the poet-monk Bao, he had an experience that put him back along the path of monasticism. He saw a number of books piled out in the temple courtyard, books from every school of Buddhism. Struck by the sight of all these volumes of literature, Hakuin prayed to the gods of the Dharma to help him choose a path. He then reached out and took a book; it was a collection of Zen stories from the Ming Dynasty. Inspired by this, he repented and dedicated himself to the practice of Zen.\n\nHe again went traveling for two years, settling down at the Eigen-ji temple when he was twenty-three. It was here that Hakuin had his first entrance into enlightenment when he was twenty-four. He locked himself away in a shrine in the temple for seven days, and eventually reached an intense awakening upon hearing the ringing of the temple bell. However, his master refused to acknowledge this enlightenment, and Hakuin left the temple.\nHakuin left again, to study for a mere eight months with Shōju Rōjin (Dokyu Etan, 1642–1721). Shoju was an intensely demanding teacher, who hurled insults and blows at Hakuin, in an attempt to free him from his limited understanding and self-centeredness. When asked why he had become a monk, Hakuin said that it was out of terror to fall into hell, to which Shōju replied \"You're a self-centered rascal, aren't you!\" Shōju assigned him a series of \"hard-to-pass\" koans. These led to three isolated moments of satori, but it was only eighteen years later that Hakuin really understood what Shōju meant with this.\n\nHakuin left Shoju after eight months of study, without receiving formal dharma transmission from Shoju Rojin, nor from any other teacher, but Hakuin considered himself to be an heir of Shoju Rojin. Today Hakuin is considered to have received dharma transmission from Shoju.\n\nHakuin realized that his attainment was incomplete. He was unable to sustain the tranquility of mind of the Zen hall in the midst of daily life. When he was twenty-six he read that \"all wise men and eminent priests who lack the Bodhi-mind fall into Hell\". This raised a \"great doubt\" (\"taigi\") in him, since he thought that the formal entrance into monkhood and the daily enactment of rituals was the bodhi-mind. Only with his final awakening, at age 42, did he fully realize what \"bodhi-mind\" means, namely working for the good of others.\n\nHakuin's early extreme exertions affected his health, and at one point in his young life he fell ill for almost two years, experiencing what would now probably be classified as a nervous breakdown by Western medicine. He called it Zen sickness, and sought the advice of a Taoist cave dwelling hermit named Hakuyu, who prescribed a visualization and breathing practice which eventually relieved his symptoms. From this point on, Hakuin put a great deal of importance on physical strength and health in his Zen practice, and studying Hakuin-style Zen required a great deal of stamina. Hakuin often spoke of strengthening the body by concentrating the spirit, and followed this advice himself. Well into his seventies, he claimed to have more physical strength than he had at age thirty, being able to sit in zazen meditation or chant sutras for an entire day without fatigue. The practices Hakuin learned from Hakuyu are still passed down within the Rinzai school.\n\nAfter another several years of travel, at age 31 Hakuin returned to Shoin-ji, the temple where he had been ordained. He was soon installed as head priest, a capacity in which he would serve for the next half-century. When he was installed as head priest of Shōin-ji in 1718, he had the title of \"Dai-ichiza\", \"First Monk\":\nIt was around this time that he adopted the name \"Hakuin\", which means \"concealed in white\", referring to the state of being hidden in the clouds and snow of mount Fuji.\n\nAlthough Hakuin had several \"satori experiences\", he did not feel free, and was unable to integrate his realization into his ordinary life. At age 41, he experienced a final and total awakening, while reading the Lotus Sutra, the sutra that he had disregarded as a young student. He realized that the Bodhi-mind means working for the good of every sentient being:\nHe wrote of this experience, saying \"suddenly I penetrated to the perfect, true, ultimate meaning of the Lotus\". This event marked a turning point in Hakuin's life. He dedicated the rest of his life to helping others achieve liberation.\n\nHe would spend the next forty years teaching at Shoin-ji, writing, and giving lectures. At first there were only a few monks there, but soon word spread, and Zen students began to come from all over the country to study with Hakuin. Eventually, an entire community of monks had built up in Hara and the surrounding areas, and Hakuin's students numbered in the hundreds. He eventually would certify over eighty disciples as successors.\n\nA well-known anecdote took place in this period:\nAt the age of 83, Hakuin died in Hara, the same village in which he was born and which he had transformed into a center of Zen teaching.\n\nHakuin saw \"deep compassion and commitment to help all sentient beings everywhere\" as an indispensable part of the Buddhist path to awakening. Hakuin emphasized the need for \"post-satori training\", purifying the mind of karmic tendencies and \nThe insight in the need of arousing bodhicitta formed Hakuin's final awakening:\nHakuin deeply believed that the most effective way for a student to achieve insight was through extensive meditation on a koan. Only with incessant investigation of his koan will a student be able to become one with the koan, and attain enlightenment. The psychological pressure and doubt that comes when one struggles with a koan is meant to create tension that leads to awakening. Hakuin called this the \"great doubt\", writing, \"At the bottom of great doubt lies great awakening. If you doubt fully, you will awaken fully\".\n\nHakuin used a fivefold classification system:<br>\n1. \"Hosshin\", dharma-body koans, are used to awaken the first insight into sunyata. They reveal the dharmakaya, or Fundamental. They introduce \"the undifferentiated and the unconditional\".<br>\n2. \"Kikan\", dynamic action koans, help to understand the phenomenal world as seen from the awakened point of view; Where \"hosshin\" koans represent \"tai\", substance, \"kikan\" koans represent \"yu\", function.<br>\n3. \"Gonsen\", explication of word koans, aid to the understanding of the recorded sayings of the old masters. They show how the Fundamental, though not depending on words, is nevertheless expressed in words, without getting stuck to words.<br>\n4. \"Hachi Nanto\", eight \"difficult to pass\" koans. There are various explanations for this category, one being that these koans cut off clinging to the previous attainment. They create another Great Doubt, which shatters the self attained through \"satori\". It is uncertain which are exactly those eight koans. Hori gives various sources, which altogether give ten \"hachi nanto\" koans.<br>\n5. \"Goi jujukin\" koans, the Five Ranks of Tozan and the Ten Grave Precepts.\n\nHakuin's emphasis on koan practice had a strong influence in the Japanese Rinzai-school. In the system developed by his followers, students are assigned koans by their teacher and then meditate on them. Once they have broken through, they must demonstrate their insight in private interview with the teacher. If the teacher feels the student has indeed attained a satisfactory insight into the koan, then another is assigned. Hakuin's main role in the development of this koan system was most likely the selection and creation of koans to be used. In this he didn't limit himself to the classic koan collections inherited from China; he himself originated one of the best-known koans, \"You know the sound of two hands clapping; tell me, what is the sound of one hand?\". Hakuin preferred this new koan to the most commonly assigned first koan from the Chinese tradition, the Mu koan. He believed his \"Sound of One Hand\" to be more effective in generating the great doubt, and remarked that \"its superiority to the former methods is like the difference between cloud and mud\".\n\nAsanga, one of the main proponents of Yogacara, introduced the idea of four ways of knowing: the perfection of action, observing knowing, universal knowing, and great mirror knowing. He relates these to the Eight Consciousnesses: \nIn time, these ways of knowing were also connected to the doctrine of the three bodies of the Buddha (Dharmakāya, Sambhogakāya and Nirmanakaya), together forming the \"Yuishiki doctrine\".\n\nHakuin related these four ways of knowing to four gates on the Buddhist path: the Gate of Inspiration, the Gate of Practice, the Gate of Awakening, and the Gate of Nirvana.\n\nOne of Hakuin's major concerns was the danger of what he called \"Do-nothing Zen\" teachers, who upon reaching some small experience of enlightenment devoted the rest of their life to, as he puts it, \"passing day after day in a state of seated sleep\". Quietist practices seeking simply to empty the mind, or teachers who taught that a tranquil \"emptiness\" was enlightenment, were Hakuin's constant targets. In this regard he was especially critical of followers of the maverick Zen master Bankei. He stressed a never-ending and severe training to deepen the insight of enlightenment and forge one's ability to manifest it in all activities. He urged his students to never be satisfied with shallow attainments, and truly believed that enlightenment was possible for anyone if they exerted themselves and approached their practice with real energy.\n\nAn extremely well known and popular Zen master during his later life, Hakuin was a firm believer in bringing the wisdom of Zen to all people. Thanks to his upbringing as a commoner and his many travels around the country, he was able to relate to the rural population, and served as a sort of spiritual father to the people in the areas surrounding Shoin-ji. In fact, he turned down offers to serve in the great monasteries in Kyoto, preferring to stay at Shoin-ji. Most of his instruction to the common people focused on living a morally virtuous life. Showing a surprising broad-mindedness, his ethical teachings drew on elements from Confucianism, ancient Japanese traditions, and traditional Buddhist teachings. He also never sought to stop the rural population from observing non-Zen traditions, despite the seeming intolerance for other schools' practices in his writings.\n\nIn addition to this, Hakuin was also a popular Zen lecturer, traveling all over the country, often to Kyoto, to teach and speak on Zen. He wrote frequently in the last fifteen years of his life, trying to record his lessons and experiences for posterity. Much of his writing was in the vernacular, and in popular forms of poetry that commoners would read.\n\nAn important part of Hakuin's practice of Zen was his painting and calligraphy. He seriously took up painting only late in his life, at almost age sixty, but is recognized as one of the greatest Japanese Zen painters. His paintings were meant to capture Zen values, serving as sorts of \"visual sermons\" that were extremely popular among the laypeople of the time, many of whom were illiterate. Today, paintings of Bodhi Dharma by Hakuin Ekaku are sought after and displayed in a handful of the world's leading museums.\n\nThrough Hakuin, all contemporary Japanese Rinzai-lineages are part of the Ōtōkan lineage, brought to Japan in 1267 by Nanpo Jomyo, who received dharma transmission in China in 1265.\n\nAll contemporary Rinzai-lineages stem from Inzan Ien (1751–1814) and Takuju Kosen (1760–1833), both students of Gasan Jito (1727–1797). Gasan is considered to be a dharma heir of Hakuin, though \"he did not belong to the close circle of disciples and was probably not even one of Hakuin's dharma heirs\".\n\nHakuin left a voluminous body of works, divided in Dharma Works (14 vols.) and Kanbun Works (4 vols.). The following are the best known and edited in English.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21760498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21760498", "title": "I am a Curator", "text": "I am a Curator\n\nI am a Curator was a process-based exhibition project by artist Per Hüttner that took place at Chisenhale Gallery, London, UK, 5 November – 14 December 2003. During the period individual or groups of people with no experience of exhibition making created 36 exhibitions and briefly got to experience the process putting together a contemporary art show. They had artwork by 57 artists to interact with. The project stirred a lot of controversy in the art world at the time. The most common critique was that the project suggested that curation and exhibition making is easy Hüttner responded to this by writing: “the goal of the project was to inspire a more diverse and profound discussion about the meaning of artworks, exhibitions and the role of the artist.\" Over the years, the project has gained recognition and has been hailed as being ahead of its time and has been widely appreciated for its visionary qualities in readers on curation and research on the subject of art and exhibition making.\n\nHüttner carried out a series of exhibitions that democratized or investigated the curatorial process in the late 1990s and in the early years of the new millennium. Many of these were collaborative and took place at the Gallery Konstakuten in Stockholm, The Hood Gallery in Los Angeles but also in galleries and public spaces in London, New York City and Vancouver and involved artists from different generations and included Geoffrey Farmer, Brian Jungen, Lenke Rothman, Neil Goldstein and curators like Reid Shier and Tone O Nielsen. In 2001 he created the curatorial framework for an exhibition at Nylon in collaboration with Goshka Macuga and Gavin Wade. and in 2002 at Curatorial Market at Cuchifritos and various public venues including Essex Street Market in New York. In these projects he developed ideas and practices that pointed towards a new way of relating to the art object and exhibition making that eventually became manifest in I am a Curator.:\n\n\"Despite its populist ideals, the Curatorial Market raises complex, insider issues about the relationship between artist and curator. ‘These two disciplines are beginning to mix and merge in ways that some people find appalling and others see as a powerful new development in the history of art making,’ Paul Clay explains. However, abandoning the idea of the autonomous piece of art can be problematic. ‘Having art that relates very strongly to the market context can fuck up the commodification process in an interesting way. It both points it up as an object to consume, and at the same time makes it harder to effectively remove from its context in order to be sold.’ Furthermore, ‘There is a danger that when curators have too strong an vision, the artists' works can end up simply as building blocks used to construct the curator's point. On the other hand if the curator's point is weak then the works can get stranded totally out of context’.\"\n\nHüttner has since developed these strategies both in projects like Repetitive Time, Democracy and Desire, (In)Visible Dialogues and in the international research network Vision Forum.\n\nDuring six weeks people or groups of people with no prior experience in exhibition making undertook 36 investigative exercises into the process of putting together an exhibition. From the outset, the idea was to create an exhibition each day, but quickly the focus moved to investigate the 57 artworks as a resource. In order to realize this strategy the artist developed some basic concepts:\n\nCurator of the Day: The daily slots were administered through an application process through which we tried to give as many different people as possible, in relation to occupation, age, sex, social and ethnic background. More often than not, the Curator of Day was a small group. Meaning that in the end roughly 70 people were curators.\n\nThe Gallery Crew: The Gallery Crew was the Curators of the Day’s aid in developing their ideas and the project that they wanted to realize during the day. The Curator of the Day was not allowed to touch the artwork, except in those cases when this was an integral part of the piece. All the handling and mounting of the work was carried out by the Gallery Crew. The crew was also responsible for informing the visitors to the gallery about the project and answering questions.\n\nSupport Structure: Support Structure hosted all the artwork. It was mobile and it was also used to display work, as well as change the size and appearance of the space. It incorporated two tables and half a dozen chairs that could also be used as plinths to present work on. But Celine Condorelli and Gavin Wade took their brief further and allowed Support Structure be a questioning and critical tool and an important aspect of the process of the project. The structure took the centre stage, but in an unexpected way the Curators of the Day remained strangely blind to the eleven meter long monster object on wheels and few, if any, references were made to it in their reports. The two also offered objects and lists of what to do if the Curator of the Day gets stuck and included phone numbers to well-known contemporary curators.\n\nThe Selectors: To provide a dynamic collection for the Curator of the Day to choose from, six people were asked to select artwork for I Am a Curator. Each devised a different approach for his or her selection. They were Patrick Bernier, Melanie Keen, Lisa Le Feuvre, Tone O. Nielsen, Reid Shier and Per Hüttner.\n\nThe Interface Cards: A5-sized plastic cards were designed and realized by American artist Scott Rigby. For each artwork available for selection there was one corresponding Interface Card. The Interface Cards along with the website (which used the same design) were the main tools for the Curator of the Day to select artwork and devise their exhibition.\n\nThe Website: All the artwork available for selection could be browsed on Chisenhale Gallery’s website. There was also continually updated photographic documentation of the exhibitions created by the Curators of the Day.\n\nEach of the 36 exhibitions realized within the framework of I am a Curator took on very different forms and used the artwork and the space in very different ways. Artist Hannah Rickards who was leading the gallery crew describes an exhibition that had great impact on the development of the project:\n\n\"Embassy of Work With Me (å.b.ä.k.e /RCA), emptied Support Structure of all its contents, Jokers and artworks, and developed a chromatic scale around the walls of the gallery (the structure having been pushed to the corner). The colour of the individual group members’ clothes determined which works they had responsibility for placing. The process had a very easily achieved self-perpetuating logic that extended to colour-coding drill batteries, masking tape, spirit levels, any tools that we may have set down for a moment. The colour-coding also included the covers of the CDs bought from the local junk shop in order to complete Sam Ely and Lynn Harris’ Playlist, along with all the book covers from Céline Condorelli’s and Gavin Wade's Joker selection of books. This seemed the most natural and successful exercise in devolution and levelling democratization that occurred during the run of the show. The ‘artworks’ suffered less in this melee than they often did when not surrounded by a chromatic sea of things; they were scrutinized and investigated by the curating group.\"\n\nHüttner talks about a few of the key experiences among the 36 exhibitions:\n\n”I have to mention Anton Nikolotov’s project (11/12/03). He wanted the work to be selected democratically. He thus devoted the whole day discussing with the visitors which works should be displayed. Each visitor who was present at a given moment was given some time to voice why a certain piece should or shouldn't be shown. When everyone had presented their case, the group voted and notes were taken on the different ideas and how many votes the different pieces got. In the end the only show that was presented was one made up of these notes shown in the massive empty space. This approach allowed I Am a Curator to be taken to another level. The boundaries between Curator of the Day and audience vanished entirely. It was wonderful to see how the process of democratization could be taken one step further than had originally been foreseen. This democratic process was at once extremely rewarding, but also hugely tiring. Rarely have I seen the members of the Gallery Crew leave so happy and tired. It was also great to see how visitors tended to stay for hours to join the discussion. At one point 15 people were present for the vote.\"\n\nOther shows included Sebastian Roach's Art for Wine Day 13/12/03 which took quite a nihilist approach to the task of selecting work:\n\n”In exchange for the donation of a bottle of wine (or beer, or spirits – even a miniature, the important thing is the token) a visitor can select and display any piece of work in the show. Alternatively they can donate a new piece of work and I will give them a bottle of wine in exchange for it. In addition, through the course of the day I will install myself in an ‘office’ created by using the versatile structure as walls drinking wine, smoking cigarettes and writing. What I write will be spontaneous and in response – directly, indirectly, or entirely tenuously – to the work, the environment and the situation, and will obviously also be tempered by the increasing consumption of alcohol. Whatever writing I do produce at the end of the day will also be available in exchange for wine.\"\n\nThe diversity of the Curator of the Day and how they interacted with the work can be exemplified by Hüttner's endnote in the catalogue:\n\n” The data that I Am a Curator generated is in itself something that would suffice for a research project. I was pleased on the last day of the exhibition that the two anthropologists Lisa Maddigan and Fuyubi Nakamura did a project that looked at the accumulated information. I think that they were slightly awestruck by the sheer bulk of information and work that could be hosted within the project. It is like the number of possibilities of arranging 57 artworks that Maki from å.b.ä.k.e. had calculated – 144,115,188,075,856,000. Considering that our solar system is roughly 2,400,000,000,000,000 minutes old the number of possibilities is quite mind-boggling.\n\nAt the time of the realization of the project there was some rather loud critique towards the project. It was suggested that it offered a very traditional approach to the idea of how an exhibition might be made. In an interview with Barnaby Drabble the artist says.\":\n\n\"I do agree, when you are faced with the possibility of just selecting existing art work that is a very traditional take on what a curator is. But then again, I think that I Am A Curator tried to do something that goes beyond that. By using a very traditional approach it enabled us to do something that was extremely creative and which opened new ideas about how to put together exhibitions. In terms of selecting the works, It wasn't as if they had only five pieces to choose from. To consider the work of fifty-seven artists in one afternoon is a major task. Also, a lot of the work was not finished, it was up to the curator of the day to complete it, a lot was interactive, and a lot had different elements that needed to be put together. So there were many different approaches on offer, reflecting the working methods of the original selectors.\"\n\nAnother criticism of the project was that the individual artwork never got the attention it deserved. Hannah Rickards who was leading the gallery crew writes:\n\n\"Even the 57 official ‘artworks,’ depending on their treatment by the Curator of the Day, sometimes barely managed to retain their “artwork” status. There were times when they did slip into being things in cupboards or things on the wall. That slippage between artworks and objects, or between people’s roles in the process, is something I see as having been central to the project, so I don’t know if I necessarily see the need for a posthumous proliferation of the term “artwork.” It feels like laminating a piece of paper you are still making notes on. In the context of this project a wipe-clean definition seems to jar.\"\n\nIn a review for \"C: International Contemporary Art Magazine\", Fergal Stapleton described the exhibition as \"a game, mutative and feudal, with several tiers of collusion\" and \"a bid for curatorial practice as art, and for curatorial supremacy over its subject arts disciplines.\" In his PhD thesis Barnaby Drabble uses I am a Curator as one of three case studies. He quotes Stapleton and builds a severe critique to the project which he perceives as being elitist and self-promotional under the guise of being democratic. On a more positive note British sociologist and media theorist, David Gauntlett suggests that projects like I am a Curator expands art into being a visual sociology;\n\n\"We should note that, in some cases, the work of socially engaged visual artists and the work of visual sociologists can look very similar. Many artists have used art to explore identity, memory and the construction of selfhood [...]. Other contemporary artists have engaged in a more externally oriented art practice which involves ‘ordinary’ people in the making of work. Just as visual sociology sometimes blurs into something like art, in these projects, art expands into being a kind of visual sociology. There are many instances of such projects; here I will give just a few examples. A project by the artist Per Hüttner, at Chisenhale Gallery, London, entitled I Am a Curator, gave 30 individuals or groups the opportunity to be ‘Curator of the Day’, over a period of six weeks (5 November–14 December 2003). Each day a new exhibition was assembled, using work by 57 artists that was made available in the gallery.\"\n\nIt is clear that, I am a Curator offered novel ways for the audience to interact with artwork and the idea of an exhibition. They were forced to deal with art in a more intimate way than in a traditional exhibition. This means that the art on display might have been visible to a smaller audience than in a normal situation and yet at the same time the intimacy, reflection and constant change of context that the work was perceived in, meant that the audience was offered the possibility to understand the complexities and contradictions of artwork on a more profound level. This experimental approach to authorship and authenticity offers opportunity for creative interpretations. This openness in its turn has led to that I am a Curator has been appropriated by various participants of the project as being 'their own' in publications and academic texts.\n\nFor the 10 year anniversary of I am a Curator David Roberts Art Foundation in London invited Per Huttner to reflect on the project. In the press release it is stated that \"The project also provoked profound questions about artistic identity and its relationship to collectivity. Both shifts, in turn, lead to changed perspectives on the relationship between artworks, exhibitions, curators and artists. In short, IAAC opened a floodgate of problematics that overwhelmed the team working with the project. It is therefore important to revisit these questions after 10 years have passed, and to see how they have influenced individual artistic processes and how they can guide us into meaningful future reflections on related issues.\" Per Hüttner was joined by artist/architect Céline Condorelli, neuroscientist Stephen Whitmarsh and Anette and Alberto Giacometti Foundation Director Véronique Wiesinger.\n\nÅbäke, A-clip, Jack Albin.

It focuses on Isa Kremer, an international singing sensation.\n\nIsa performed modern renditions of traditional Jewish folk songs for audiences around the world, refusing to conceal her Jewish culture even during the Holocaust. The film explores the life of a woman who brought Jewish music to international audiences. \"Isa Kremer\" reconstructs the singer's life through archival footage of her performances, family interviews, and the critic’s responses to her shows. She had a beautiful, well-trained voice but, it was her alluring presence that enthralled audiences.\n\nAs a young girl, Isa was marked by a fierce talent, independent mind and firm determination. At age fifteen, her poems were being published in the liberal “Odessa News.” Isa enjoyed early career success as a classical and opera singer. However, it was Jewish poet Chaim Bialik upon seeing her perform suggested that she sing Jewish folk songs instead. Isa took the advice to heart and immediately rethought her performances. She began to sing in Yiddish and adapted Jewish folk songs for the stage. Trained in opera, Ida combined singing and acting in a novel way, embodying the characters she sang about, and made simple folk songs part of a grand tradition. With her unique show and dazzling stage presence, Isa toured internationally. This allowed her to befriend the social elite and intelligentsia (including Albert Einstein), collect stunning jewelry and receiving lavish praise. One critic described her as “a radiant incarnation of artist’s witchery.”\n\nDespite her success, Isa’s life was never easy. She saw some of the 20th century’s most violent political failures. War and revolution seemed to follow her wherever she went. Isa was born in Russia, and when the Revolution broke out, it separated her family. She moved away from Europe before the Holocaust, but watched it destroy the lives of her family and the shtetl lifestyle in which she was raised. Then, in the last chapters of her life, she witnessed brutal political unrest in her adopted home country of Argentina.\n\n\"Isa Kremer\" participates in a debate that’s still relevant today — the working woman. In order to travel and perform as freely as she did, Isa had to make sacrifices. Relationships and her family were secondary to her demanding career. Isa’s daughter gives a sad smile while explaining that she was raised by a wet nurse and knew her mother only by the splendid parties that were thrown when she came home from touring.\n\nThe documentary also recognizes the struggle between cultural and personal identity. Isa was not religious and never wanted to be a Jewish singer; she wanted to be a great singer. But she expected that her Yiddish songs would appeal to everyone, not just Jews. “It must be an art for the great mass of people,” she explained, believing Jewish folk songs were so rich in meaning and beauty they could touch all of humanity.\n\n"}

She worked in many mediums, but is particularly well known for her colourful wooden relief sculptures. Her work was significantly influenced by primitive and outsider art, and created primarily from recycled materials, earning her recognition as an early eco artist.\n\nMabel Pakenham-Walsh was born in Lancaster, England, the daughter of Robert Pakenham-Walsh, a prominent psychiatrist. Born with congenital hip dysplasia, she suffered lifelong physical disability; and in 1957, while a student at university, she was badly injured in a major car accident which compounded her disability. Consequently, Pakenham-Walsh campaigned throughout her life for disability rights, especially for children and youths, ultimately leaving a legacy with the Snowdon Trust to assist disabled students in future. Pakenham-Walsh was active in the London arts scene throughout the 1960s and '70s, and befriended many significant figures, including Lord Snowdon, Frances Bond, Martin Leman, Maeve and Mervyn Peake, Wendy Ramshaw, and Tom Stoppard. Pakenham-Walsh also taught woodcarving classes to Further Education students in Kent, England. In the late 1970s she moved to Aberystwyth, Wales, where she continued to create, and became a local legend and beloved eccentric.\n\nPakenham-Walsh trained as an artist at Lancaster and Morecambe College of Arts and Crafts (1954–58) and Wimbledon College of Art (1958-59). The writer and artist Mervyn Peake was an early mentor.\n\nFrom the beginning of her career, Pakenham-Walsh created drawings, paintings, and sculptures made almost exclusively from mundane and salvaged materials; this unique strategy was borne of necessity as Pakenham-Walsh encountered \"social barriers associated with being a female artist in the mid twentieth century, which made it difficult for her [...] to acquire raw materials for her art.\" Pakenham-Walsh's first published artwork was in the early 1960s when her biro drawings appeared in the literary journal \"Transatlantic Review\". At that time, she was employed as a designer at Pinewood Studios, where she created set-pieces for major motion-pictures, including \"Cleopatra\"; she also worked as a sculptor at Shepperton Studios. From 1965 to 1982, she exhibited at the Summer Exhibitions of the Royal Academy of Arts in London. During this era, select London artists rejected abstraction and conceptualism to pursue \"the depiction of the human figure and everyday landscape\"; Pakenham-Walsh also sought to depict ordinary daily life, creating art that was both \"playful and profound [to] invoke the deep time of human nature.\" Pakenham-Walsh \"exhibited widely in her lifetime in many art galleries and museums\" worldwide. Her work has been shown at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and is held in numerous public and private collections, including: the National Library of Wales, the Ulster Museum, Aberystwyth University, and the UK Craft Council; the actor and art historian Vincent Price and the photographer Lord Snowdon also admired and collected her work.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44715", "title": "Morality play", "text": "Morality play\n\nThe morality play is a genre of Medieval and early Tudor theatrical entertainment. In their own time, these plays were known as interludes, a broader term for dramas with or without a moral. Morality plays are a type of allegory in which the protagonist is met by personifications of various moral attributes who try to prompt him to choose a godly life over one of evil. The plays were most popular in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries. Having grown out of the religiously based mystery plays of the Middle Ages, they represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre. Hildegard von Bingen's \"Ordo Virtutum\" (English: \"Order of the Virtues\") composed c. 1151, is the earliest known morality play by more than a century, and the only Medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music.\n\nMorality plays typically contain a protagonist who represents either humanity as a whole or a smaller social structure. Supporting characters are personifications of good and evil. This alignment of characters provides the play’s audience with moral guidance. Morality plays are the result of the dominant belief of the time period, that humans had a certain amount of control over their post-death fate while they were on earth.\n\nIn \"Everyman\", perhaps the archetypal morality play, the characters take on the common pattern, representing broader ideas. Some of the characters in \"Everyman\" are God, Death, Everyman, Good-Deeds, Angel, Knowledge, Beauty, Discretion, and Strength. The personified meanings of these characters are hardly hidden. The premise of \"Everyman\" is that God, believing that the people on earth are too focused on wealth and worldly possessions, sends Death to Everyman to remind him of God's power and the importance of upholding values. The emphasis put on morality, the seemingly vast difference between good and evil, and the strong presence of God makes \"Everyman\" one of the most concrete examples of a morality play. At the same time, most morality plays focus more on evil, while \"Everyman\" focuses more on good, highlighting sin in contrast.\n\nOther plays that take on the typical traits of morality plays, but are rarely given the title of \"morality play\" are \"Hickscorner\" and \"The Second Shepherds' Play.\" The characters in \"Hickscorner\" are Pity, Perseverance, Imagination, Contemplation, Freewill, and Hickscorner. They blatantly represent moral ideals. In \"The Second Shepherds' Play\", the characters are less obviously representative of good and evil, being primarily a trio of shepherds. But other characters such as Mary, The Child Christ, and An Angel show a strong moral presence and the importance of God in the play.\n\nIn early English dramas Justice was personified as an entity which exercised “theological virtue or grace, and was concerned with the divine pronouncement of judgment on man”. However, as time progressed, more moralities began to emerge; it is during this transitional period where one begins to see Justice begin to assume more and more the qualities of a judge. The Justice in \"Respublica\" begins to concern himself with administering justice on “the criminal element”, rather than with the divine pronouncement on a generic representative of mankind. This is the first instance where one may observe a direct divergence from the theological virtues and concerns that were previously exerted by Justice in the morality plays of the fifteenth century. The Justice in \"Respublica\" is personified as a “civil force rather than a theological one”. An evolution of sorts takes place within the morals and agendas of Justice, he begins to don on the Judicial Robe of prosecutor and executioner.\n\nAnother change envelops in the character of Justice during the sixteenth century in morality plays; Equity replaces Justice and assumes the judiciary duties previously performed by Justice. This changing of rulers, or preceding justices, is done when Equity declares that his brother Justice has been banished from the country and that he (Equity) will from now on take on the duties of the former monarch, Justice. This change of ruling heads is portrayed in the morality play, \"Liberality and Prodigality\", where Equity serves Virtue in the detection, arrest, and punishment of Prodigality for the robbery and murder of Tenacity, a yeoman in the country of Middlesex. Virtue states,\n\nSo horrible a fact can hardly pleaded for favour:\nTherefore go you, Equity, examine more diligently\nThe manner of this outrageous robbery:\nAnd as the same by examination shall appear,\nDue justice may be done in presence here. (\"Liberality and Prodigality\" 377)\nThe meta phases that Justice undergoes during the sixteenth century in morality plays, from “Justice” to “Equity” further illustrates the evolution of Justice; not only did Justice change from a “theological abstraction to a civil servant”, but he experienced a corporeal change as well.\n\nOne may readily observe the evolutionary progression of Justice as portrayed in the plays of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. One encounters Justice in the early-fifteenth-century moralities as a performer playing the role of a theological virtue or grace, and then one sees him develop to a more serious figure, occupying the position of an arbiter of justice during the sixteenth century. It is a journey of discovery and great change on which Justice welcomes one to embark as one leafs through the pages of morality plays.\n\nAlthough the purpose of all morality plays is to instruct listeners on the means of receiving redemption, morality plays after the Protestant Reformation are of a distinctly different didacticism than the morality plays before the Reformation.\n\nMorality plays before the Reformation teach a Catholic approach to redemption, with an emphasis on works and the sacraments, a view originating with Tertullian (c. 155 – c. 240 AD) and Cyprian (d. 258). The emphasis on works can be seen in the final speech in one of the most well-known of medieval morality plays, Everyman, in which there is a clear statement about the necessity of good works for the one who desires heaven:\n<poem> \nDoctor: This moral men may have in mind;\nYe hearers, take it of worth, old and young,\nAnd forsake pride, for he deceiveth you in the end,\nAnd remember Beauty, Five-wits, Strength, and Discretion,\nThey all at last do Everyman forsake,\nSave his Good-Deeds, there doth he take.\nBut beware, and they be small\nBefore God, he hath no help at all.\nNone excuse may be there for Everyman.\n</poem>\nThe importance of the sacraments is seen in the morality tale entitled Mankind (play). In this play, the sacrament of penance is emphasized when the allegorical character Mercy speaks to Mankind: “Come let us go to this cloister and incline your mind towards God. Don’t sin thinking that you are assured mercy, that itself is a sin. It’s not a good idea to take advantage of the Lord.”\nPre-Reformation plays emphasized the importance of the sacraments of the Catholic Church (such as partaking in mass and baptism), the church clergy, the church hierarchy, the church establishment in general, and the abstinence from the Seven Deadly Sins. Many of the morality tales were allegories and involved characters with names of Vices (e.g., Gluttony) and Virtues (e.g., Goodness). Their purpose was to direct the playgoers to pursue virtue and renounce vice.\n\nFrequently a character representing a Vice would state, upon his first appearance, that he was evil. For example, in The Castle of Perseverance, a character called Lust-Liking states:\n<poem>\nLo, me! here ready Lord, to fare and to flee\nTo seek thee a servant valued and dear!\nWhoso will by Folly ruled be, \nHe is worthy to be a servant here,\nWho slips into the Sins Seven.\n</poem>\nEven after this initial introduction, however, the Vice will continually reiterate to the audience that his nature is diabolic. Very often, the Vice presented will bring his character into criticism by the manner in which he presents himself to his audience, thus further demonstrating his wickedness. For example, the Vices in the earlier morality plays often spoke using vulgar language and by blasphemous swearing. Often, these curses were spoken in Latin, which being considered the holy language, made these curses even more offensive to the audience. Moreover, the Vices often made a mockery of religious practices sacred to the audience, thereby castigating themselves in the eyes of their audience. Deceit is another means by which the Vice exposes his wickedness to the audience and serves as an example to them of what to avoid in a righteous life. Furthermore, in the pre-Reformation play, the Vices denounce their own characters by acting violently toward each other, and toward the Virtues.\n\nWhereas the pre-Reformation morality plays sought to reinforce the establishment of the Catholic Church and Catholic doctrine, the post-Reformation morality plays worked to destroy Catholic credibility and demonise the Catholic Church. Although post-Reformation morality plays were like its predecessor in that it also was concerned with the salvation of its audience, it differed in that it believed that the theology promoted by pre-Reformation plays was antithetical to salvation. Thus, a major shift in focus, from concern for the individual’s moral behaviour to concern for the individual's theological practices, occurred with the post-Reformation morality plays. The wave of Protestantism which fuelled the content of these plays dictated that more attention should be given to warning people against the Catholic Church than of their sinful nature. The means of redemption, according to the philosophy embedded in post-Reformation morality plays, is dependent upon the audience understanding the truthfulness of Protestant theology and verses and also the deceptiveness and wickedness of Catholic theology, whose best example is the secular play of Calderón.\n\nThe Vices in post-Reformation morality plays are almost always depicted as being Catholic. At times this depiction is achieved through their physical appearance. For example, Vices in post-Reformation morality plays would be dressed as cardinals, friars, monks, or the pope. Other times, the Vice comes out and states he is a Catholic, or elucidates that he is Catholic by swearing a Catholic pledge. Oftentimes, the Vice in post-Reformation plays admits that Catholic theology is flawed, and that by being Catholic the Vice is committing treason. Moreover, Vices often appear ignorant and naive, especially when it comes to their biblical understanding and knowledge of the New Testament. Often, morality plays coming out the post-Reformation period ridicule ritualistic Catholic practices. Furthermore, these plays postulated that Catholics were opposed to moral behaviour and truthfulness, and that the Catholic Church warped the text of the Bible to justify sinning. To deceive the victim of post-Reformation morality plays, the Vice typically assumes a new name to disguise what actual Vice he is.\n\nBecause the Vice is aggressively tied to Catholicism from the outset of the play, when the Vice is reprimanded and damned, so are his Catholic beliefs. Therefore, the Vice served as a central component to discrediting the Catholic Church in post-Reformation morality plays.\n\nThe role of the Virtues in post-Reformation morality plays was to preach a message of salvation based upon an individual’s faith and the grace of God. They promoted Protestant beliefs of original sin, the importance of bible reading and meditation, the marriage of clergymen, and the cleansing of sin only through Christ’s sacrifice; at the same time, they discredited the Catholic belief in transubstantiation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16033861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16033861", "title": "Persian handicrafts", "text": "Persian handicrafts\n\nIranian handicrafts are handicraft works originating from Iran.\n\n\nTermeh is a cloth which is woven since the Safavid era in Iran. There is an argument between researchers about its origin. In the past, the first step in termeh weaving was preparing its raw materials. So it was very important to be careful while preparing wool, washing and drying it. Weaving termeh needs proper wool which has long fibers. Usually the designs of Iranian termeh were the result of the co-operation between two main persons – an expert and a worker. Weaving termeh was a very careful, sensitive and time consuming work that a good weaver could produce only 25 to 30 centimeters (1 feet) in a day. The background colors which are used in termeh are mostly jujube red, light red, green, orange and black. Termeh as a valuable textile has many different usages and patterns such as:\nTermeh is a very durable cloth in which fixed colors are used so it can be washed and dried easily. Nowadays termeh is mostly used for collectible tablecloth.These tablecloth are usually decorated with elaborative Persian embroidery called “sermeh doozy”.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurquoise Inlaying both on jewelry and containers includes a copper, brass, silver, nickel or bronze object on parts of the surface of which small pieces of turquoise are set in mosaic fashion thus giving the object a special glamor. The production of Turquoise Inlaying includes two general stages:\n\nA. Goldsmith\nGoldsmith includes the making and preparation of the object intended for Turquoise Inlaying using one of the metals indicated above. This is done by a goldsmith or forger using hands, press machine or both. After the object is formed generally, be it a piece of jewelry or a container, the part to be turquoise inlaid is demarked and a thin metal strand (of the same material as the metal used in the fabrication of the object) called “kandan” is placed around and soldered onto it. This part around the intended form is a so-called wall standing two or three millimeters above the surface of the container. This is usually done by or sometimes the turquoise inlayer himself. If the part prepared for Turquoise Inlaying takes up too much of the surface with an empty looking background, strands of the same metal are used to place smaller patterns of decorative nature (such as flowers, bushes, etc.) inside it and soldered again. This both makes the work more beautiful and makes the turquoise inlaid surface stronger.\n\nB. Turquoise Inlaying\nFirst of all, the turquoise inlayer buys waste turquoise chips from turquoise forming workshops or turquoise mines in Mashhad, Neishabour or Damghan. Since such turquoise chips are usually accompanied by some earth and ordinary stone chips, they are first separated and cleaned. Then, the turquoise chips are graded based on their sizes so the right size turquoise chips are used in making each Turquoise Inlaying object in proportion to the surface area. In the next step, the object is heated (to about 30 °C) and, while heating, a “walnut lac” is sprinkled onto the parts that have to be turquoise laid so that the lac powder is almost melted and covers the intended surface. While the lac is still soft and sticky on the object surface, some of the turquoise chips that were prepared before based on their size are place on the work surface. The chips must be placed in a way so that no space is left between them as far as possible. In order to fill the possible gaps between turquoise chips, temperature is added (to about 40 °C) and some more lac powder is sprinkled onto the chips until the lac layer is softened to a melting form, and then try to fill all the spaces by adding smaller turquoise chips, or, as they say, the chips sit well on the surface. This is usually done by pressing the turquoise chips by hand onto the surface so that they stick fast to it. After the object is cooled, the lac covered parts become rigid. After that stage, the parts covered by lac and turquoise chips are polished with emery so the extra lac and little raised parts of the chips are flattened. That is the stage where the color of the turquoise chips becomes visible as turquoise and that of lac as black (or dark brown) in the spaces between the chips. After this stage is completed, if there is still some fallouts in some parts of the work, the object is heated again, and the empty parts are restored with small turquoise chips and lac. Then, the surface is polished and honed again. The restoration is sometimes done with a type of turquoise colored putty that is prepared with “mol” mud, oil and lapis paint. The final stage of Turquoise Inlaying is burnishing which is done in two stages itself. The first stage consists of burnishing the metal parts which is done at a goldsmith or machining workshop where the opaque layer that is formed on the metal parts during Turquoise Inlaying is removed with hand tools or a machine blade, and then, those parts are polished so the metal becomes shiny. The second stage consists of burnishing the turquoise inlaid product. After polishing the metal parts of the object, the work is returned to the turquoise inlayer’s workshop where the turquoise inlaid surface is polished with olive or sesame oil so that part becomes shiny, too. A Turquois Inlaying craftsman employs different tools and devices for different stages of the job mostly including dies, hammers, drills, natural gas and gasoline torches, pincers, pliers, forceps, different metal pipes tweezers, files and emeries. The most important point in Turquoise Inlaying is correct installation of turquoise chips on the metal so that it is strong enough and the chips do not come off while burnishing the work. The other important point is that a piece of turquoise inlaid work will be of more artistic value if the turquoise chips are installed more regularly in close contact, i.e. without a space in between.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3656192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3656192", "title": "Screw axis", "text": "Screw axis\n\nA screw axis (helical axis or twist axis) is a line that is simultaneously the axis of rotation and the line along which translation of a body occurs. Chasles' theorem shows that each Euclidean displacement in three-dimensional space has a screw axis, and the displacement can be decomposed into a rotation about and a slide along this screw axis.\n\nPlücker coordinates are used to locate a screw axis in space, and consist of a pair of three-dimensional vectors. The first vector identifies the direction of the axis, and the second locates its position. The special case when the first vector is zero is interpreted as a pure translation in the direction of the second vector. A screw axis is associated with each pair of vectors in the algebra of screws, also known as screw theory.\n\nThe spatial movement of a body can be represented by a continuous set of displacements. Because each of these displacements has a screw axis, the movement has an associated ruled surface known as a \"screw surface\". This surface is not the same as the \"axode\", which is traced by the instantaneous screw axes of the movement of a body. The instantaneous screw axis, or 'instantaneous helical axis' (IHA), is the axis of the helicoidal field generated by the velocities of every point in a moving body.\n\nWhen a spatial displacement specializes to a planar displacement, the screw axis becomes the \"displacement pole\", and the instantaneous screw axis becomes the \"velocity pole\", or instantaneous center of rotation, also called an \"instant center\". The term \"centro\" is also used for a velocity pole, and the locus of these points for a planar movement is called a centrode.\n\nThe proof that a spatial displacement can be decomposed into a rotation and slide around and along a line in space is attributed to Michel Chasles in 1830. Recently the work of Gulio Mozzi has been identified as presenting a similar result in 1763.\n\nA screw displacement (also screw operation or rotary translation) is the composition of a rotation by an angle \"φ\" about an axis (called the screw axis) with a translation by a distance \"d\" along this axis. A positive rotation direction usually means one that corresponds to the translation direction by the right-hand rule. Except for \"φ\" = 180°, we have to distinguish a screw displacement from its mirror image. Unlike for rotations, a righthand and lefthand screw operation generate different groups.\n\nThe combination of a rotation about an axis and a translation in a perpendicular direction is a rotation about a parallel axis. However, a screw operation with a nonzero translation vector along the axis cannot be reduced like that. Thus the effect of a rotation combined with \"any\" translation is a screw operation in the general sense, with as special cases a pure translation, a pure rotation and the identity. Together these are all the direct isometries in 3D.\nIn crystallography, a screw axis symmetry is combination of rotation about an axis and a translation parallel to that axis leaves a crystal unchanged. If \"φ\" = 360°/\"n\" for some positive integer \"n\", then screw axis symmetry implies translational symmetry with a translation vector which is \"n\" times that of the screw displacement.\n\nApplicable for space groups is a rotation by 360°/\"n\" about an axis, combined with a translation along the axis by a multiple of the distance of the translational symmetry, divided by \"n\". This multiple is indicated by a subscript. So, 6 is a rotation of 60° combined with a translation of 1/2 of the lattice vector, implying that there is also 3-fold rotational symmetry about this axis. The possibilities are 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, and 6, and the enantiomorphous 3, 4, 6, and 6.\n\nA non-discrete screw axis isometry group contains all combinations of a rotation about some axis and a proportional translation along the axis (in rifling, the constant of proportionality is called the twist rate); in general this is combined with \"k\"-fold rotational isometries about the same axis (\"k\" ≥ 1); the set of images of a point under the isometries is a \"k\"-fold helix; in addition there may be a 2-fold rotation about a perpendicularly intersecting axis, and hence a \"k\"-fold helix of such axes.\n\nLet be an orientation-preserving rigid motion of R. The set of these transformations is a subgroup of Euclidean motions known as the special Euclidean group SE(3). These rigid motions are defined by transformations of x in R given by\nconsisting of a three-dimensional rotation \"A\" followed by a translation by the vector d.\n\nA three-dimensional rotation \"A\" has a unique axis that defines a line \"L\". Let the unit vector along this line be S so that the translation vector d can be resolved into a sum of two vectors, one parallel and one perpendicular to the axis \"L\", that is,\nIn this case, the rigid motion takes the form\n\nNow, the orientation preserving rigid motion \"D\"* = \"A\"(x) + d transforms all the points of R so that they remain in planes perpendicular to \"L\". For a rigid motion of this type there is a unique point c in the plane \"P\" perpendicular to \"L\" through 0, such that\nThe point C can be calculated as\nbecause d does not have a component in the direction of the axis of \"A\".\n\nA rigid motion \"D\"* with a fixed point must be a rotation of around the axis \"L\" through the point c. Therefore, the rigid motion\nconsists of a rotation about the line \"L\" followed by a translation by the vector d in the direction of the line \"L\".\n\nConclusion: every rigid motion of R is the result of a rotation of R about a line \"L\" followed by a translation in the direction of the line. The combination of a rotation about a line and translation along the line is called a screw motion.\n\nA point C on the screw axis satisfies the equation:\nSolve this equation for C using Cayley's formula for a rotation matrix\nwhere [B] is the skew-symmetric matrix constructed from Rodrigues' vector\nsuch that\n\nUse this form of the rotation \"A\" to obtain\nwhich becomes\nThis equation can be solved for C on the screw axis P(t) to obtain,\n\nThe screw axis of this spatial displacement has the Plücker coordinates .\n\nThe screw axis appears in the dual quaternion formulation of a spatial displacement . The dual quaternion is constructed from the dual vector defining the screw axis and the dual angle , where \"φ\" is the rotation about and \"d\" the slide along this axis, which defines the displacement D to obtain,\n\nA spatial displacement of points q represented as a vector quaternion can be defined using quaternions as the mapping\nwhere d is translation vector quaternion and \"S\" is a unit quaternion, also called a versor, given by\nthat defines a rotation by 2\"θ\" around an axis S.\n\nIn the proper Euclidean group E(3) a rotation may be conjugated with a translation to move it to a parallel rotation axis. Such a conjugation, using quaternion homographies, produces the appropriate screw axis to express the given spatial displacement as a screw displacement, in accord with Chasles’ theorem.\n\nThe motion of a rigid body may be the combination of rotation about an axis (the screw axis) and a translation along that axis. This screw move is characterized by the velocity vector for the translation and the angular velocity vector in the same or opposite direction. If these two vectors are constant and along one of the principal axes of the body, no external forces are needed for this motion (moving and spinning). As an example, if gravity and drag are ignored, this is the motion of a bullet fired from a rifled gun.\n\nThis parameter is often used in biomechanics, when describing the motion of joints of the body. For any period of time, joint motion can be seen as the movement of a single point on one articulating surface with respect to the adjacent surface (usually distal with respect to proximal). The total translation and rotations along the path of motion can be defined as the time integrals of the instantaneous translation and rotation velocities at the IHA for a given reference time.\n\nIn any single plane, the path formed by the locations of the moving instantaneous axis of rotation (IAR) is known as the 'centroid', and is used in the description of joint motion.\n"}
{"id": "5405121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5405121", "title": "Shibui", "text": "Shibui\n\nShibui (渋い) (adjective), shibumi (渋み) (noun), or shibusa (渋さ) (noun) are Japanese words which refer to a particular aesthetic of simple, subtle, and unobtrusive beauty. Like other Japanese aesthetics terms, such as \"iki\" and \"wabi-sabi\", \"shibui\" can apply to a wide variety of subjects, not just art or fashion.\n\nShibusa is an enriched, subdued appearance or experience of intrinsically fine quality with economy of form, line, and effort, producing a timeless tranquility. Shibusa includes the following essential qualities: \n\nThe colors of shibusa are \"muddy\" colors. For example, in interior decorating and painting, gray is added to primary colors to create a silvery effect that ties the different colors together into a coordinated scheme. Depending upon how much gray is added, shibui colors range from pastels to dark. Occasionally, a patch of brighter color is added as a highlight.\n\nShibusa is not to be confused with wabi or sabi. Though many wabi or sabi objects are shibui, not all shibui objects are wabi or sabi. Wabi or sabi objects can be more severe and sometimes exaggerate intentional imperfections to such an extent that they can appear to be artificial. Shibui objects are not necessarily imperfect or asymmetrical, though they can include these qualities. \n\nThe seven elements of shibusa are simplicity, implicity, modesty, naturalness, everydayness, imperfection, and silence. They are adapted from the concepts authored by Dr. Soetsu Yanagi (1898–1961), aesthetician and museum curator, published in the Japanese magazine \"Kogei\" between 1930–1940. The aristocratic simplicity of shibusa is the refined expression of the essence of elements in an aesthetic experience producing quietude. Spare elegance is evident in darkling serenity with a hint of sparkle. Implicity allows depth of feeling to be visible through spare surface design thereby manifesting the invisible core that offers new meanings with each encounter. The person of shibui modesty exalts excellence via taking time to learn, watch, read, understand, develop, think, and merges into understatement and silence concerning oneself. Naturalness conveys spontaneity in unforced growth. Shibusa freedom is maintained in healthy roughness of texture and irregular asymmetrical form wherein the center lies beyond all particular things, in infinity. Everydayness raises ordinary things to a place of honor, void of all artificial and unnecessary properties, thus imparting spiritual joy—for today is more auspicious than tomorrow. Everydayness provides a framework, a tradition for an artist's oeuvre to be a unit not a process. Hiroshi Mizuo argues that the best examples of shibusa are found in the crafts, ordinary objects made for everyday use. They tend to be more spontaneous and healthy than many of the fine arts. Imperfection is illustrated in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s gothic novel, \"The Marble Faun\". The chapter \"An Aesthetic Company\" mentions some ragged and ill-conditioned antique drawings and their attributions and virtues.\nImperfection in shibusa Sōetsu Yanagi in \"The Unknown Craftsman\" refers to as \"beauty with inner implications\". Creation here means making a piece that will lead the viewer to draw beauty from it for oneself. Shibui beauty in Tea Ceremony is in the artistry of the viewer.\n\nShibusa's sanctuary of silence is non-dualism—the resolution of opposites. Its foundation is intuition coupled with faith and beauty revealing phases of truth and the worship and reverence for life.\n\nIn James A. Michener's book \"Iberia\" the adjective 'shibui' is referenced as follows: \"The Japanese have a word which summarizes all the best in Japanese life, yet it has no explanation and cannot be translated. It is the word \"shibui\", and the best approximation to its meaning is 'acerbic good taste.'\" The author Trevanian (the nom de plume of Dr. Rodney William Whitaker) wrote in his 1979 best-selling\nnovel \"Shibumi\", \"Shibumi has to do with great refinement underlying commonplace appearances.\" In the business fable \"The Shibumi Strategy\", the author, Matthew E. May, wrote that shibumi \"has come to denote those things that exhibit in paradox and all at once the very best of everything and nothing: Elegant simplicity. Effortless effectiveness. Understated excellence. Beautiful imperfection.\"\nShibui, a registration or 'felt sense' of evolving perfection. What is being registered is the 'Life' behind the qualities of any experience. A 'felt sense' of qualities, such as, quiet beauty with intelligence, love, light, and joy. These qualities can be more easily registered when quietly viewing simple, natural everyday phenomenon or objects, such as a sunrise or a simple piece of pottery. Shibui can sometimes be more easily registered by two people in a meditative state (quiet in their emotions and their minds) while viewing the same phenomenon or object. For example, when viewing the same sunset or piece of art, subconsciously, both people register the qualities of the 'Life' or implicity underlying the experience or object; this registration of the underlying 'Life' precipitates into the conscious as registering something 'extraordinary' in the everyday 'ordinary'. If you both register, then looking into the other person's eyes, you understand that you both shared the same phenomenon, a 'knowing' of the underlying 'Life', or at least the qualities of that underlying 'Life'. The qualities registered can seem paradoxical. Complex experiences or objects seem simple; perfection is found in imperfection. All objects and experiences, both everyday and extraordinary, can have a beauty, a quiet purposeful intent, a cool 'matter of fact' underlying joy.\n\nPotters, musicians, painters, bonsai and other artists often work to bring in 'Shibui-like' qualities into their art. A few go behind these qualities to bring the underlying 'Life' into their art. Expert singers, actors, potters, and artists of all other sorts were often said to be \"shibui\"; their expertise caused them to do things beautifully without making them excessive or gaudy. Today, sometimes baseball players are even said to be \"shibui\" when they contribute to the overall success of the team without doing anything to make themselves stand out individually. The apparent effortlessness displayed by athletes such as tennis player Roger Federer and hockey great Wayne Gretzky are examples of shibumi in personal performance. Shibui, and its underlying 'Life', is found in all art and in everything around us—including ourselves. Taking the path to understand and experience Shibui, is a step towards understanding and consciously registering the 'Life' underlying all.\n\nOriginating in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) as \"shibushi\", the term originally referred to a sour or astringent taste, such as that of an unripe persimmon. \"Shibui\" maintains that literal meaning still, and remains the antonym of amai (甘い), meaning 'sweet'.\n\nHowever, by the beginnings of the Edo period (1615–1868), the term had gradually begun to refer to a pleasing aesthetic. The people of Edo expressed their tastes in using this term to refer to anything from song to fashion to craftsmanship that was beautiful by being understated, or by being precisely what it was meant to be and not elaborated upon. Essentially, the aesthetic ideal of \"shibumi\" seeks out events, performances, people or objects that are beautiful in a direct and simple way, without being flashy.\n\nSoetsu Yanagi work as translated by Bernard Leach in \"The Unknown Craftsman\" discusses shibumi.\n\nThe concept of \"shibusa\" was introduced to the West in August and September, 1960, in publications of the American magazine \"House Beautiful\".\n\n"}
{"id": "5102726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5102726", "title": "Spanish art", "text": "Spanish art\n\nSpanish art has been an important contributor to Western art and Spain has produced many famous and influential artists including Velázquez, Goya and Picasso. Spanish art was particularly influenced by Italy and France during the Baroque and Neoclassical periods, but Spanish art has often had very distinctive characteristics, partly explained by the Moorish heritage in Spain (especially in Andalusia), and through the political and cultural climate in Spain during the Counter-Reformation and the subsequent eclipse of Spanish power under the Bourbon dynasty.\n\nThe prehistoric art of Spain had many important periods-it was one of the main centres of European Upper Paleolithic art and the rock art of the Spanish Levant in the subsequent periods. In the Iron Age north-western Spain was a centre for Celtic art, and Iberian sculpture has a distinct style, partly influenced by coastal Greek settlements. Spain was conquered by the Romans by 200 BC and Rome was rather smoothly replaced by the Germanic Visigoths in the 5th century AD, who represented only a small ruling class, who soon Christianized. The relatively few remains of Visigothic art and architecture show an attractive and distinct version of wider European trends, but the Muslim conquest of most of Spain in the 8th century was a massive disruption and transformation. Over the following centuries the wealthy courts of Al-Andaluz produced many works of exceptional quality, culminating in the Alhambra in Granada, right at the end of Muslim Spain.\n\nMeanwhile, the parts of Spain remaining Christian, or that were re-conquered, were prominent in Pre-Romanesque and Romanesque art, especially in Catalonia. Late Gothic Spanish art flourished under the unified monarchy in the Isabelline Gothic and Plateresque styles, and the already strong traditions in painting and sculpture began to benefit from the influence of imported Italian artists. The enormous wealth that followed the flood of American gold saw lavish spending on the arts in Spain, much of it directed at religious art in the Counter-Reformation. Spanish control of the leading centre of North European art, Flanders, from 1483 and also of the Kingdom of Naples from 1548, both ending in 1714, had a great influence on Spanish art, and the level of spending attracted artists from other areas, such as El Greco, Rubens and (from a safe distance) Titian in the Spanish Golden Age, as well as great native painters such as Diego Velázquez, José de Ribera, Francisco Zurbarán and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo.\n\nSpanish Baroque architecture has survived in large quantity, and has both strains marked by exuberant extravagance, as in the Churrigueresque style, and a rather severe classicism, as in the work of Juan de Herrera. It was generally the former which marked the emerging art and Spanish Colonial architecture of the Spanish Empire outside Europe, as in Latin America (New Spanish Baroque and Andean Baroque), while the Baroque Churches of the Philippines are simpler. \nThe decline of the Habsburg monarchy brought this period to an end, and Spanish art in the 18th and early-19th century was generally less exciting, with the huge exception of Francisco Goya. The rest of 19th-century Spanish art followed European trends, generally at a conservative pace, until the Catalan movement of Modernisme, which initially was more a form of Art Nouveau. Picasso dominates Spanish Modernism in the usual English sense, but Juan Gris, Salvador Dalí and Joan Miró are other leading figures.\n\nThe early Iberians have left many remains; northern-western Spain shares with south-western France the region where the richest Upper Paleolithic art in Europe is found in the Cave of Altamira and other sites where there are cave paintings made between 35,000 and 11,000 BC. The Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin (as UNESCO term it) is from the eastern side of Spain, probably dating from about 8000-3500 BC, and shows animal and hunting scenes often developed with a growing feeling for the whole composition of a large scene. Portugal in particular is rich in megalithic monuments, including the Almendres Cromlech, and Iberian schematic art is stone sculpture, petroglyphs and cave paintings from the early metal ages, found all over the Iberian peninsula, with both geometric patterns, but also a higher usage of simple pictogram-like human figures than is typical of comparable art from other areas. The Casco de Leiro, a late Bronze Age gold ritual helmet, may relate to other golden hats found in Germany, and the Treasure of Villena is a huge hoard of geometrically decorated vessels and jewellery, perhaps from the 10th century BC, including 10 kilos of gold.\n\nIberian sculpture before the Roman occupation reflects the contacts with other advanced ancient cultures who set up small coastal colonies, including the Greeks and Phoenicians; the Sa Caleta Phoenician Settlement on Ibiza has survived to be excavated, where most now lie under large towns, and the Lady of Guardamar was excavated from another Phoenician site. The Lady of Elche (probably 4th century BC) possibly represents Tanit, but also shows Hellenistic influence, as do the 6th century Sphinx of Agost and Biche of Balazote. The Bulls of Guisando are the most impressive examples of \"verracos\", which are large Celtiberian animal sculptures in stone; the 5th century BC Bull of Osuna is a more developed single example. Some decorated \"falcata\", the distinctive curving Iberian sword, have survived, and large numbers of bronze statuettes used as votive offerings. The Romans gradually conquered all of Iberia between 218 BC and 19 AD.\n\nAs elsewhere in the Western Empire, the Roman occupation largely overwhelmed native styles; Iberia was an important agricultural area for the Romans, and the elite acquired vast estates producing wheat, olives and wine, with some later emperors coming from the Iberian provinces; many huge villas have been excavated. The Aqueduct of Segovia, Roman Walls of Lugo, Alcántara Bridge (104–106 AD), and the Tower of Hercules lighthouse are among a number of well-preserved major monuments, impressive remains of Roman engineering if not always art. Roman temples survive fairly complete at Vic, Évora (now in Portugal), and Alcántara, as well as elements in Barcelona and Córdoba. There must have been local workshops producing the high-quality mosaics found, though most of the better free-standing sculpture was probably imported. The Missorium of Theodosius I is an important Late Antique silver dish that was found in Spain but was probably made in Constantinople.\n\nThe Christianized Visigoths ruled Iberia after the collapse of the Empire, and the rich 7th century Treasure of Guarrazar, probably deposited to avoid looting in the Muslim Conquest of Spain, is now a unique survival of Christian votive crowns in gold; though Spanish in style, the form was probably then used by elites across Europe. Other Visigothic art in the form of metalwork, mostly jewellery and buckles, and stone reliefs, survives to give an idea of the culture of this originally barbarian Germanic people, who kept themselves very largely separate from their Iberian subjects, and whose rule crumbled when the Muslims arrived in 711.\n\nThe jewelled \"crux gemmata\" Victory Cross, La Cava Bible and the Agate Casket of Oviedo are survivals from the 9-10th century of the rich Pre-Romanesque culture of the Asturias region in north-western Spain, which remained under Christian rule; the Santa María del Naranco banqueting house overlooking Oviedo, completed in 848 and later surviving as a church, is a unique survival in Europe. The Codex Vigilanus, completed in 976 in the region of Rioja, shows a complex mixture of several styles.\n\nThe extraordinary palace-city of Medina Azahara near Córdoba was built in the 10th century for the Ummayad Caliphs of Córdoba, intended as the capital of Islamic Andaluz, and is still being excavated. A considerable amount of the highly sophisticated decoration of the main buildings has survived, showing the enormous wealth of this very centralized state. The palace at Aljafería is later, from after Islamic Spain split into a number of kingdoms. Famous examples of Islamic architecture and its decoration are the Cathedral–Mosque of Córdoba, whose Islamic elements were added in stages between 784 and 987, and the Alhambra and Generalife palaces in Granada from the final periods of Muslim Spain.\n\nThe Pisa Griffin is the largest known Islamic sculpture of an animal, and the most spectacular of a group of such figures from Al-Andalus, many made to hold up the basins of fountains (as at the Alhambra), or in smaller cases as perfume-burners and the like.\n\nThe Christian population of Muslim Spain (the Mozarabs) developed a style of Mozarabic art whose best known survivals are a series of illuminated manuscripts, several of the commentaries on the Book of Revelation by the Asturian Saint Beatus of Liébana (c. 730 – c. 800), which gave subject matter that allowed the brightly coloured primitivist style full scope to demonstrate its qualities in manuscripts of the 10th century like the Morgan Beatus, probably the earliest, the Gerona Beatus (illuminated by a female artist Ende), Escorial Beatus and the Saint-Sever Beatus, which was actually produced some distance from Muslim rule in France. Mozarabic elements, including a background of brightly coloured strips, can be seen in some later Romanesque frescos.\n\nHispano-Moresque ware pottery began in the south, presumably mainly for local markets, but Muslim potters were later encouraged to migrate to the Valencia region, where the Christian lords marketed their luxury lustrewares to elites all over Christian Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries, including the Popes and the English court. Spanish Islamic ivory carving and textiles were also very fine; the continuing industries producing tiles and carpets in the peninsula owe their origins largely to the Islamic kingdoms.\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Islamic rulers during the Reconquista, considerable Muslim populations, and Christian craftsmen trained in Muslim styles, remained in Spain, and Mudéjar is the term for work in art and architecture produced by such people. The Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon is recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site, and the 14th century \"Patio de las Doncellas\" built for Peter of Castile in the Alcázar of Seville is another outstanding example. The style could harmonize well with Christian European medieval and Renaissance styles, for example in elaborate wood and stucco ceilings, and Mudéjar work often continued to be produced for some centuries after an area passed to Christian rule.\n\nIn Spain, the art of the Romanesque period represented a smooth transition from the preceding Pre-Romanesque and Mozarabic styles. Many of the best surviving Romanesque church frescos that were at the time found all over Europe come from Catalonia with good examples in the churches of the Vall de Boí area; many of these were only uncovered during the 20th Century. Some of the best examples have been moved to museums, especially the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya in Barcelona, which has the famous Central Apse from Sant Climent in Taüll and the frescos from Sigena. The finest examples of Castillian Romanesque frescoes are considered to be those in the San Isidoro in Leon, the paintings from San Baudelio de Berlanga, now mostly in various museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and those from Santa Cruz de Maderuelo in Segovia. There are also a number of altar frontals painted on wood and other early panel paintings.\n\nThe Gothic art of Spain represented a gradual development from previous Romanesque styles, being led by external models, first from France, and then later from Italy. Another distinctive aspect was the incorporation of Mudejar elements. Eventually the Italian influence, which transmitted Byzantine stylistic techniques and iconography, entirely displaced the initial Franco-Gothic style Catalonia continued to be a prosperous area which has left many fine altarpieces; however the region went into decline after the emphasis of trade moved to the Atlantic after the American colonies opened up, which partly accounts for so many medieval survivals there, as there was not the money for Renaissance and Baroque renovations to churches.\n\nDue to important economic and political links between Spain and Flanders from the mid-15th century onwards, the early Renaissance in Spain was heavily influenced by Netherlandish painting, leading to the identification of a Hispano-Flemish school of painters. Leading exponents included Fernando Gallego, Bartolomé Bermejo, Pedro Berruguete and Juan de Flandes.\n\nOverall the Renaissance and subsequent Mannerist styles are hard to categorise in Spain, due to the mix of Flemish and Italian influences, and regional variations.\n\nThe main centre for Italian Renaissance influence entering Spain was Valencia due to its proximity and close links with Italy. This influence was felt via then import of artworks, including four paintings by Piombo and many prints by Raphael, the arrival of the Italian Renaissance artist Paolo de San Leocadio, and also by Spanish artists who spent time working and training there. Such artists included Fernando Yáñez de la Almedina (1475–1540) and Fernando Llanos, who displayed Leonadesque features in their works, such as delicate, melancholic expressions, and sfumato modelling of features.\n\nElsewhere in Spain, the influence of the Italian Renaissance was less pure, with a relatively superficial use of techniques that were combined with preceding Flemish practices and incorporated Mannerist features, due the relatively late examples from Italy, once Italian art was already strongly Mannerist. Apart from technical aspects, the themes and spirit of the Renaissance were modified to the Spanish culture and religious environment. Consequently, very few classical subjects or female nudes were depicted, and the works frequently exhibited a sense of pious devotion and religious intensity – attributes that would remain dominant in much art of Counter Reformation Spain throughout the 17th century, and beyond.\nartists included Vicente Juan Masip (1475–1550) and his son Juan de Juanes (1510–1579), the painter and architect Pedro Machuca (1490–1550), and Juan Correa de Vivar (1510–1566).\nHowever, the most popular Spanish painter of the early 17th Century was Luis de Morales (1510?–1586), called by his contemporaries \"The Divine\", because of the religious intensity of his paintings. From the Renaissance he also frequently used sfumato modeling, and simple compositions, but combined them with Flemish style precision of details. His subjects included many devotional images, including the \"Virgin and Child\".\n\nThe Spanish Golden Age, a period of Spanish political ascendancy and subsequent decline, saw a great development of art in Spain. The period is generally considered to have begun at some point after 1492 and ended by or with the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, though in art the start is delayed until the reign of Philip III (1598-1621), or just before, and the end also delayed until the 1660s or later. The style thus forms a part of the wider Baroque period in art, although as well as considerable influence from great Baroque masters such as Caravaggio and later Rubens, the distinctive nature of the art of the period also included influences that modified typical Baroque characteristics. These included influence from contemporary Dutch Golden Age painting and the native Spanish tradition which give much of the art of the period an interest in naturalism, and an avoidance of the grandiosity of much Baroque art. Important early contributors included Juan Bautista Maíno (1569–1649), who brought a new naturalistic style into Spain, Francisco Ribalta (1565–1628), and the influential still life painter, Sánchez Cotán (1560–1627).\n\nEl Greco (1541–1614) was one of the most individualistic of the painters of the period, developing a strongly Mannerist style based on his origins in the post Byzantine Cretan school, in contrast to the naturalist approaches then predominant in Seville, Madrid and elsewhere in Spain. Many of his works reflect the silvery-greys and strong colours of Venetian painters such as Titian, but combined with strange elongations of figures, unusual lighting, disposing of perspective space, and filling the surface with very visible and expressive brushwork.\n\nAlthough mostly active in Italy, particularly in Naples, José de Ribera (1591–1652) considered himself Spanish, and his style is sometimes used as an example of the extremes of Counter-Reformation Spanish art. His work was very influential (largely through the circulation of his drawing and prints throughout Europe) and developed significantly through his career.\n\nBeing the gateway to the New World, Seville became the cultural centre of Spain in the 16th Century, and attracted artists from across Europe, drawn by lure of commissions for the growing empire, and for the numerous religious houses of the wealthy city. Starting from a strongly Flemish tradition of detailed and smooth brushwork, as revealed in the works of Francisco Pacheco (1564–1642), over time a more naturalistic approach developed, with the influence of Juan de Roelas (c. 1560–1624) and Francisco Herrera the Elder (1590–1654). This more naturalistic approach, influenced by Caravaggio, became predominant in Seville, and formed the training background of three Golden Age masters: Cano, Zurbarán and Velázquez.\n\nFrancisco Zurbarán (1598–1664) is known for the forceful, realistic use of chiaroscuro in his religious paintings and still lifes. Although seen as limited in his development, and struggling to handle complex scenes. Zurbarán's great ability to evoke religious feelings made him very successful in receiving commissions in conservative Counter-Reformation Seville.\n\nSharing the same painting master - Francisco Pacheco - as Velázquez, Alonso Cano (16601–1667) was also active in sculpture and architecture. His style moved from the naturalism of his early period, to a more delicate, idealistic approach, revealing Venetian and Van Dyck influences.\n\nDiego Velázquez (1599–1660) was the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he created scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family, other notable European figures, and commoners. In many portraits, Velázquez gave a dignified quality to less fortunate members of society like beggars and dwarfs. In contrast to these portraits, the gods and goddesses of Velázquez tend to be portrayed as common people, without divine characteristics. Besides the forty portraits of Philip by Velázquez, he painted portraits of other members of the royal family, including princes, infantas (princesses), and queens.\n\nLater Baroque elements were introduced as a foreign influence, through visits to Spain by Rubens, and the circulation of artists and patrons between Spain and the Spanish possessions of Naples and the Spanish Netherlands. Significant Spanish painters taking up the new style were Juan Carreño de Miranda (1614–1685), Francisco Rizi (1614–1685) and Francisco de Herrera the Younger (1627–1685), son of Francisco de Herrera the Elder an initiator of the naturalist emphasis of the Seville School. Other notable Baroque painters were Claudio Coello (1642–1693), Antonio de Pereda (1611–1678), Mateo Cerezo (1637–1666) and Juan de Valdés Leal (1622–1690).\n\nThe pre-eminent painter of the period - and most famous Spanish painter prior to the 19th century appreciation of Velázquez, Zurbarán and El Greco - was Bartolomé Esteban Murillo (1617–1682). Working for most of his career in Seville, his early work reflected the naturalism of Caravaggio, using a subdued, brown palette, simple but not harsh lighting, and religious themes that are portrayed in a natural or domestic setting, as in his \"Holy Family with a Little Bird \" (c. 1650). Later he incorporated elements of the Flemish Baroque from Rubens and Van Dyck. In the \"Soult Immaculate Conception\", a brighter and more radiant colour range is used, the swirling cherubs bringing all the focus upon the Virgin, whose heavenward gaze and diffuse and warmly glowing halo make it an effective devotional image, an important component of his output; the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin theme alone was represented about twenty times by Murillo.\n\nThe beginning of the Bourbon dynasty in Spain under Philip V led to great changes in art patronage, with the new French-oriented court favoring the styles and artists of Bourbon France. Few Spanish painters were employed by the court – a rare exception being Miguel Jacinto Meléndez (1679–1734) – and it took some time before Spanish painters adapted to the new Rococo and Neoclassical styles. Leading European painters, including Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Anton Raphael Mengs, were active and influential.\n\nRestricted from royal sponsorship, many Spanish painters continued the Baroque style in religious compositions. This was true of Francisco Bayeu y Subias (1734–1795), a skilled fresco painter, and of Mariano Salvador Maella (1739–1819) who both developed in the direction of the severe Neoclassicism of Mengs. Another important avenue for Spanish artists was portraiture, which was an active sphere for Antonio González Velázquez (1723–1794), Joaquín Inza (1736–1811) and Agustín Esteve (1753–1820). But it is in the genre of the still life that royal patronage was also successfully found, in the works by artists such as the court painter Bartolomé Montalvo (1769–1846) and Luis Egidio Meléndez (1716–1780).\n\nContinuing in the Spanish still life tradition of Sánchez Cotán and Zurbarán, Meléndez produced a series of cabinet paintings, commissioned by the Prince of Asturias, the future King Charles IV, intended to show the full range of edible foods from Spain. Rather than being merely formal studies in Natural History, he used stark lighting, low viewpoints and severe compositions to dramatise the subjects. He showed great interest and attention to the details of reflections, textures and highlights (such the highlight on the patterned vase in \"Still Life with Oranges, Jars, and Boxes of Sweets\") reflecting the new spirit of the age of Enlightenment.\n\nFrancisco Goya was a portraitist and court painter to the Spanish Crown, a chronicler of history, and, in his unofficial work, a revolutionary and a visionary. Goya painted the Spanish royal family, including Charles IV of Spain and Ferdinand VII. His themes range from merry festivals for tapestry, draft cartoons, to scenes of war, fighting and corpses. In his early stage, he painted draft cartoons as templates for tapestries and focused on scenes from everyday life with vivid colors. During his lifetime, Goya also made several series of \"grabados\", etchings which depicted the decadence of society and the horrors of war. His most famous painting series are the \"Black Paintings\", painted at the end of his life. This series features works that are obscure in both color and meaning, producing uneasiness and shock.\n\nHe is considered the most important Spanish artist of late 18th and early 19th centuries and throughout his long career was a commentator and chronicler of his era. Immensely successful in his lifetime, Goya is often referred to as both the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns.\n\nVarious art movements of the 19th Century influenced Spanish artists, largely through them undertaking training in foreign capitals, particularly in Paris and Rome. In this way Neo-classicism, Romanticism, Realism and Impressionism became important strands. However, they were often delayed or transformed by local conditions, including repressive governments, and by the tragedies of the Carlist Wars. Portraits and historical subjects were popular, and the art of the past - particularly the styles and techniques of Velázquez - were significant.\n\nEarly years were still dominated by the academicism of Vincente López (1772–1850) and then the Neoclassicism of the French painter, Jacques-Louis David, as in the works by José de Madrazo (1781–1859), the founder of an influential line of artists and gallery directors. His son, Federico de Madrazo (1781–1859), was a leading figure in Spanish Romanticism, together with Leonardo Alenza (1807–1845),\nValeriano Bécquer and Antonio María Esquivel.\n\nThe later part of the century saw a strong period of Romanticism represented in history paintings, as in the works of Antonio Gisbert (1834–1901), Eduardo Rosales (1836–1873) and Francisco Pradilla (1848–1921). In these works the techniques of Realism were frequently used with Romantic subjects. This can clearly be seen in \"Joan the Mad\", a famed early work by Pradilla. The composition, facial expressions, and stormy sky reflect the dramatic emotion of the scene; yet the precise clothing, the texture of the mud, and other details, show great realism in the artist's attitude and style. Mariano Fortuny(1838–1874) also developed a strong Realist style, after earlier being influenced by the French Romantic Eugène Delacroix, and became Spain's famous artist of the century\nThe Valencian \nJoaquín Sorolla (1863–1923) excelled in the dexterous representation of the people and landscape under the sunlight of his native land, thus reflecting the spirit of Impressionism in many paintings, particularly his famous seaside paintings. In \"Children on the beach\" he makes the reflections, shadows and gloss of the water and skin his true subject. The composition is very daring, with the horizon omitted, one of the boys cut off, and strong diagonals leading to the contrasts and increased saturation of the upper-left of the work.\n\nDuring the first half of 20th Century many leading Spanish artists were working in Paris, where they contributed to - and sometimes led - developments in the Modernist art movement.\nAs perhaps the most important example of this, Picasso, working together with the French artist Braque, created the concepts of Cubism; and the sub-movement of Synthetic Cubism has been judged to have found its purest expression in the paintings and collages of Madrid-born Juan Gris. In a similar way, Salvador Dalí became a central figure of the Surrealist movement in Paris; and Joan Miró was influential in abstract art.\n\nPicasso's Blue Period (1901–1904), which consisted of somber, blue-tinted paintings was influenced by a trip through Spain. The Museu Picasso in Barcelona features many of Picasso's early works, created while he was living in Spain, as well as the extensive collection of Jaime Sabartés, Picasso's close friend from his Barcelona days who, for many years, was Picasso's personal secretary. There are many precise and detailed figure studies done in his youth under his father's tutelage, as well as rarely seen works from his old age that clearly demonstrate Picasso's firm grounding in classical techniques. Picasso presented the most durable homage to Velázquez in 1957 when he recreated \"Las Meninas\" in his characteristically cubist form. While Picasso was worried that if he copied Velázquez's painting, it would be seen only as a copy and not as any sort of unique representation, he proceeded to do so, and the enormous work—the largest he had produced since \"Guernica\" in 1937—earned a position of relevance in the Spanish canon of art. Málaga, Picasso's birthplace, houses two museums with significant collections, the Museo Picasso Málaga and Birthplace Museum.\nSalvador Dalí was a central artist within the Surrealist movement in Paris. Although Dalí was criticized for accommodating Franco's regime, André Breton, the Surrealist leader and poet, asked him to represent Spain at the 1959 Homage to Surrealism Exhibition which celebrated the fortieth anniversary of Surrealism. In line with the Surrealist movement's objectives, Dalí stated that his artistic aim was that \"...the world of imagination and of concrete irrationality may be as objectively evident ... as that of the exterior world...\", and this goal can be seen in one of his most familiar paintings, \"The Persistence of Memory\". Here he paints with a precise, realistic style, based on studies of Dutch and Spanish masters, but with a subject that dissolves the boundaries between organic and mechanical and is more akin to the nightmarish scenes of the Netherlandish painter Hieronymus Bosch, whose \"Garden of Earthly Delights\" provided the model for the central, sleeping figure of Dalí's work.\nJoan Miró was also closely associated with the Surrealists in Paris, who particularly approved of his use of automatism in composition and execution, designed to expose the subconscious mind. Although his later and more popular paintings are refined, whimsical and apparently effortless, his influential period in the 1920s and 1930s produced works that were provocative in their sexual symbolism and imagery, and employing rough, experimental materials, including sandpaper, unsized canvases, and collage. In mature period painting, \"La Leçon de Ski\", his characteristic language of signs, figures and black linear forms against more textured and painterly background is evident.\n\nIgnacio Zuloaga and José Gutiérrez Solana were other significant painters of the first half of 20th century.\n\nIn the post-War period, the Catalan artist Antoni Tàpies became famous for his abstract works, many of which use very thick textures and the incorporation of non-standard materials and objects. Tàpies has won several international awards for his works.\n\nThe Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time.\nAlonso Berruguete (sculptor, painter and architect) is called the \"Prince of Spanish sculpture\" because of the grandeur, originality, and expressiveness achieved in his works.\nHis main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the Cathedral of Toledo, the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa Úrsula in the same locality.\n\nOther notable sculptors were Bartolomé Ordóñez, Diego de Siloé, Juan de Juni and Damián Forment.\n\nAnother period of Spanish Renaissance sculpture, the Baroque, encompassed the last years of the 16th century and extended into the 17th century until reaching its final flowering the 18th, developing a truly Spanish school and style, of sculpture, more realistic, intimate and independently creative than that of the previous one which was tied to European trends, especially those of the Netherlands and Italy. There were two Schools of special flair and talent: the Seville School, to which Juan Martínez Montañés belonged (called the Sevillian Fidias), whose most celebrated works are the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Seville, another in Vergara, and a Saint John; and the Granada School, to which Alonso Cano belonged, to whom an Immaculate Conception and a Virgin of Rosary, are attributed.\n\nAnother notable Andalusian Baroque sculptors were Pedro de Mena, Pedro Roldán and his daughter Luisa Roldán, Juan de Mesa and Pedro Duque Cornejo.\n\nThe Valladolid school of the 17th century (Gregorio Fernández, Francisco del Rincón) was succeeded in the 18th century, although with less brilliance, by the Madrid School, and it was soon transformed into a purely academic style by the middle of the century. In turn, the Andalusian school was replaced by that of Murcia, epitomised in the person of Francisco Salzillo, during the first half of the century. This last sculptor is distinguished by the originality, fluidity, and dynamic treatment of his works, even in those representations of great tragedy. More than 1,800 works are attributed to him, the most famous products of his hand being the Holy Week floats (pasos) in Murcia, most notable amongst which are those of the Agony in the Garden and the Kiss of Judas.\n\nIn the 20th century the most important Spanish sculptors were Julio González, Pablo Gargallo, Eduardo Chillida and Pablo Serrano.\n\nSpanish monarchs beginning with Isabel the Catholic, Queen of Castile (1451–1504), who accumulated large and impressive collections of objets d'art, 370 tapastries, and 350 paintings, a number by important artists including Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling, Hieronymous Bosch, Juan de Flandes, and Sandro Botticelli. Isabel's grandson, Charles I of Spain, the first Hapsburg king of Spain, was a patron and collector of art, as was his sister, Mary of Hungary. Both admired works by Titian. When the siblings died, the art passed to Philip II of Spain, Charles's son. Philip IV (1605–1665) followed in the family tradition as a passionate art collector and patron. During his reign, Velázquez, Zurbarán and others produced many works of art. Philip commissioned works and purchased others, sending his representatives to acquire works for the monarch's collection. One of Philip IV's major contributions to art in Spain was to entail his collection, preventing their sale or other dispersal. Under the Spanish Bourbon monarch, Charles IV, the notion of bringing together major works from other repositories in Spain took shape, probably not for the public to view but for artists to study. The Prado Museum in Madrid became the main repository for that art. \n\nThe Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Francisco, founded in 1744, now functions also as a museum in Madrid. The Museum of the Americas in Madrid has a collection of casta paintings and other art brought back to Spain from the Americas, as well as sculpture and archeological artifacts.\n\n\n"}

The film received three state Nandi Awards, three Indian Express Awards and two South Filmfare Awards, including Nandi Award for Best Feature Film and Filmfare Best Film Award (Telugu). \n\nMeenakshi (Bhanupriya) and Savitri (Devilalita) are daughters of a Kuchipudi doyen, Vedantam Seshendra Sharma. While a highly accomplished artist in his field, Seshendra Sharma is not well-off and has not been able to afford for his daughters, a conventional education. Both of them have achieved a respectable degree of proficiency — Savitri in Carnatic classical music and Meenakshi in classical dance.\n\nSavitri is grateful for her knowledge and interest and looks forward to a life that will require her to hone her skills in the same art. Meenakshi, on the other hand, is bitter about the lack of opportunity that she feels in the field of classical dance in India and resolves to make a simpler and more pleasurable life for herself as soon as possible, while confiding her ambitions only to her sister.\n\nChandrasekhar (Venkatesh) is a tenant who has just moved in next door. He is a painter and is shown to be handling movie promotions as a large amount of his work. He develops an interest in the neighbors and tries to help them in whatever way he can, partly because of his (unconfessed) interest in Meenakshi and partly because of his interest in the art which seems to be slowly fading away from public life.\n\nThe rest of the film is largely built around Meenakshi's journey from skepticism to devotion in her pursuit of dance. Chandrasekhar is shown to be an important catalyst in this transformation. Meenakshi becomes an accomplished dancer through the direction of renowned Odissi dancer Sharon Lowen, and gets the opportunity to go to the United States and perform. She learns of Chandrasekhar's love for her, and finally unites with Chandrasekhar, confessing her love for him as well.\n\n\nThe production design was helmed by Arun D. Ghodgaonkar, with cinematography by Lok Singh. Casting was done by K. Viswanath, including American dancer Sharon Lowen, who portrayed herself as a veteran Odissi artist. The song sequences demanded locations that were spread across Puri, the Himalayas, the Valley of Flowers National Park, the stupa at Dhauli Odisha and Visakhapatnam.\n\nThe music for the film was composed by Ilaiyaraaja and released on ECHO Music Company.\n\n\n\n"}

He writes mainly epic fantasy, and has also written two movie novelizations. He has written 23 \"New York Times\" bestsellers during his writing career, and has over 21 million copies of his books in print. He is one of the biggest-selling living fantasy writers.\n\nBrooks was born in the rural Midwestern town of Sterling, Illinois, and spent a large part of his life living there. He is an alumnus of Hamilton College, earning his B.A. in English literature in 1966. He later obtained a law degree (J.D.) from Washington and Lee University. He was a practicing attorney before becoming a full-time author.\n\nBrooks had been a writer since high school, writing mainly in the genres of science fiction, western, fiction, and non-fiction. One day, in his early college life, he was given a copy of J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\", which inspired him to write in one genre. While Tolkien inspired the genre, Brooks stated during his TEDxRainier talk \"Why I Write about Elves\", as well as at the Charlotte Literary Festival that he credits the inspiration of his style of writing to William Faulkner's works. With this inspiration, he then made his debut in 1977 with \"The Sword of Shannara\".\n\nAfter finishing two sequels to \"The Sword of Shannara\", Brooks moved on to the series which would become known as the \"Landover\" novels. Brooks then wrote a four-book series titled \"The Heritage of Shannara\". For the next fourteen years, he wrote more \"Landover\" books, then went on to write \"The Word and Void\" trilogy. Continuing the \"Shannara\" series, Brooks wrote the prequel to \"The Sword of Shannara\", titled \"First King of Shannara\". He then wrote two series, \"The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara\" and \"High Druid of Shannara\" and recently finished a third, \"Genesis of Shannara\", a trilogy bridging his \"Word and Void\" and \"Shannara\" series. The sixth book in the \"Landover\" series, \"A Princess of Landover\", was released in August 2009. \nReturning to Shannara, a duology, \"Legends of Shannara\", taking place after the events of \"Genesis of Shannara\", was written next. The first book, entitled \"Bearers of the Black Staff\", was released in August 2010 and the second, \"The Measure of the Magic\", was released in August 2011.\nHe next completed a trilogy entitled \"The Dark Legacy of Shannara\". The three books are; \"Wards of Faerie\" (Feb 2013), \"Bloodfire Quest\" (June 2013), and \"Witch Wraith\" (Dec 2013). He followed this with the trilogy \"Defenders of Shannara\", which include \"The High Druid's Blade\" (July 2014), \"The Darkling Child\" (June 2015), and \"The Sorcerer's Daughter\" (May 24, 2016).\nAccording to his website, he is currently working on the final and concluding tetralogy of the Shannara series known as The Fall of Shannara. The first book in the tetralogy is The Black Elfstone and was released on June 13, 2017.\n\nA television series based on the Shannara works, entitled \"The Shannara Chronicles\" began showing on MTV in January 2016. The show starts with the second book of the original series, \"Elfstones\", as there are strong female roles which did not appear in the first book. The second season aired in 2017 on SPIKE On January 16, 2018, it was announced that the series had been cancelled after two seasons. Producers later announced that the series is being shopped to other networks.\n\nBrooks resides in northwestern Oregon with his wife, Judine.\n\nAfter writing \"Indomitable\", a short story constituting an epilogue to \"The Wishsong of Shannara\", Terry Brooks declared:\n"}
{"id": "33157813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33157813", "title": "The Clock (2010 film)", "text": "The Clock (2010 film)\n\nThe Clock is an art installation by video artist Christian Marclay. It is a looped 24-hour video supercut (montage of scenes from film and television) that feature clocks or timepieces. The artwork itself functions as a clock: its presentation is synchronized with the real time, resulting in the time shown in a scene being the actual time. \n\nMarclay developed the idea for \"The Clock\" while working on his 2005 piece \"Screen Play\". With the support of the London-based White Cube gallery, he assembled a team to find footage, which he edited together over the course of three years. Marclay debuted \"The Clock\" at White Cube's London gallery in 2010. The work garnered critical praise, winning the Golden Lion at the 2011 Venice Biennale. Its six editions were purchased by major museums, allowing it to attract a widespread following.\n\nAfter midnight, characters go to bars and drink. Some seek intimacy while others are angry to have been awakened by the phone. In the early hours, characters are generally alone or sleeping. Several dream sequences occur between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. At around 7 a.m., characters are shown waking up. From 9 a.m. to noon, they eat breakfast and have wake-up sex. As noon approaches, a sequence of action scenes build up to bells ringing in \"High Noon\". The video's pace immediately slows once noon passes.\n\nBetween 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., transportation becomes important as characters travel on planes, trains, and automobiles. At 6 p.m., characters eat dinner and have shootouts. In the evening, they attend parties. Around 8 p.m., orchestras and theaters begin their shows. As midnight approaches, the characters become more frantic, throwing tantrums and requesting stays of execution. Screeching violins from multiple clips build up to the moment. At midnight Orson Welles is impaled on a clock tower in \"The Stranger\", and Big Ben, a common sight in \"The Clock\", explodes in \"V for Vendetta\".\n\n\"The Clock\" was conceived in 2005 while Marclay was working on the video score \"Screen Play\". He realised that he needed a way for musicians to synchronise with film footage. An assistant at the Eyebeam Art and Technology Center brought him footage of clocks, and Marclay began wondering if it was possible to find footage of every minute of the day. He kept the idea secret for several years, concerned that someone else would poach his idea. After his partner Lydia Yee accepted a position at the Barbican Centre, Marclay moved from New York to London in mid 2007. There he proposed the film to the White Cube gallery, unsure of the project's feasibility. He received a budget of over US$100,000, covered in part by the Paula Cooper Gallery.\n\nThe first several months of production were intended to show that Marclay would be able to find enough material to achieve his vision. White Cube helped him assemble a team of six people to watch DVDs and copy scenes with clocks or time. Marclay himself was often unfamiliar with the source works. They used a Google Spreadsheet to record and search through clips. As the number of scenes available increased, Marclay was able to start working on transitions between scenes. Working in Final Cut Pro, he edited clips together, standardising the video formats and smoothing the audio. He cited Bruce Conner's \"odd transitions\" as an influence on his editing. Marclay wanted to include more outlandish, melodramatic clips but worried that it would be exhausting over a long period. He instead focused on incidental moments; his head assistant Paul Anton Smith explained that Marclay wanted to show scenes that were \"banal and plain but visually interesting.\" One assistant who focused heavily on scenes of violence was fired, and the remaining assistants began to specialise in individual film genres.\n\nAfter six months, Marclay presented White Cube with several extended sequences, confident that he would eventually be able to finish the project. The footage began taking up too much capacity, so he worked on two Power Mac G5s with footage split by time of day. Marclay organised files by hour, which became like chapters for him. Each folder suggested different themes to him, allowing him to form loose narratives. He spent three years editing scenes together. Some of the scenes not selected for \"The Clock\" became a part of his 2012 performance piece \"Everyday\".\n\nIn mid 2010, Marclay recruited Quentin Chiappetta, a sound designer with whom he had worked before, to work on the audio for \"The Clock\". He saved files to disc and sent them to Chiappetta so that the films' soundtracks could be equalised. By September Marclay realised that hundreds of the audio transitions were lacking, with White Cube set to premiere \"The Clock\" the following month. Because of his background as a DJ, he did not want to use simple fades between clips. He went to Chiappetta's MediaNoise studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where the two worked on the soundtrack using Pro Tools. In some cases, they created completely new audio for the scenes. During the first week of \"The Clock\"s exhibition, Marclay continued fixing continuity errors and working on the audio. The final product used around 12,000 clips. Because of its size, Marclay enlisted professor Mick Grierson to create a program that plays the separate audio and video tracks, synchronised with the current time. The program continues running while a museum is closed so that it remains synchronised.\n\nMarclay made six editions of \"The Clock\", plus two artist's proofs. Five copies were designated to be sold to institutions for US$467,500 each under the condition that \"The Clock\" can't be played in more than one location at the same time. The last copy was sold to hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen for an undisclosed amount. Within a day of premiering \"The Clock\", White Cube received a host of offers from museums, some of which purchased copies jointly. The sale became one of the largest purchases of video art and one of the highest purchases to happen on the primary market. The work owned by the New York collectors Jill and Peter Kraus, is a promised gift to the Museum of Modern Art. In 2011, Steve Tisch pledged the money needed to buy the work for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. One month later, the National Gallery of Canada and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, announced the acquisition of another copy. In February 2012, yet another version was acquired jointly by the Tate in London, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.\n\nMarclay originally considered making \"The Clock\" as a public art piece. However, difficulty with lighting and sound made it impractical. Marclay gave museums specifications for the exhibitions' screening rooms. He wanted the video to be projected onto a screen, in a room with white IKEA couches. Presenting the piece became a source of friction between Marclay and some museums. \"The Art Newspaper\" reported that LACMA's director Michael Govan wanted to project it onto the museum, though LACMA denied suggesting it be projected outside. Marclay disapproved of other screening locations suggested by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Tate. In order to ensure that the full video would be exhibited, he required that museums agree to be open for all 24 hours at some point during its run.\n\n\"The Clock\" premiered 15 October 2010 at White Cube's gallery in central London. Since then, it has attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors and found crossover success beyond art patrons. The Paula Cooper Gallery exhibited it in early 2011, where it attracted 11,500 visitors over the course of a month. In mid 2012, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts showed it to 18,000 people over six weeks. MoMA heavily promoted its run with a silent disco, a New Years celebration, and a dedicated @TheClockatMoMA account on Twitter. The month-long exhibition drew over 40,000 people.\n\nWhen he started to make \"The Clock\", Marclay expected that copyright would not be a substantial obstacle, theorizing that \"If you make something good and interesting and not ridiculing someone or being offensive, the creators of the original material will like it.\" He did not get copyright clearances for any of the films used. He stated that although his use was illegal, \"most would consider it fair use.\" Because of the film's copyright status, museums have offered it as part of their general admission instead of charging for separate tickets.\n\n\"The Clock\" has been described as \"addictive\" and \"mesmerizing\". \"The Guardian\" called it \"a masterpiece of our times\". Chris Petit complimented its \"edge-of-hysteria relentlessness, the anti-narrative drive\", and the simple concept, commenting that he wished he had thought of the idea himself. In \"The New York Review of Books\", Zadie Smith stated that \"The Clock\" \"is neither bad nor good, but sublime, maybe the greatest film you have ever seen\". \"Newsweek\" named Marclay one of the ten most important artists of today. He was included in the 2012 \"Time\" 100.\n\nAt the 2011 Venice Biennale, Marclay was recognised as the best artist in the official exhibition, winning the Golden Lion for \"The Clock\". Accepting the Golden Lion, Marclay invoked Andy Warhol, thanking the jury \"for giving \"The Clock\" its fifteen minutes\". The film also won in the \"Best Editing\" category at the Boston Society of Film Critics Awards 2011.\n\n\"The Clock\" reveals its plot largely through the use of cutaway shots. A shot indicating the time is followed by a reaction shot with a character's emotional response, often one of anxiety, fear, or boredom. Petit remarked that the impact of repeated reactions lacking context \"comes over as incredibly weird\". The sequence interpellates viewers into \"The Clock\"s flow, and they often experience a detached, hypnotic effect.\n\nMarclay viewed \"The Clock\" as a \"memento mori\". In contrast to the escapism that cinema provides, \"The Clock\" draws attention to how much time the audience has spent watching it. As they spend more time with the film, its actors reappear at various points in their careers. To make this theme more explicit, Marclay included symbols of time and death in connecting shots. These included sunsets; withering flowers; and burning cigarettes, which he described as \"the twentieth-century symbol of time\", a modern version of burning candles. Marclay included shots of turntables and vinyl records not only as a representation of \"capturing time, trying to hold it back\", but also as a self-reference to his earlier works that used vinyl.\n\nMarclay made several forays into video art that informed \"The Clock\". His 1995 film \"Telephones\" forms a narrative out of clips from Hollywood films where characters use a telephone. It was a link between Marclay's audio and video art, and its discontinuous structure was a template for \"The Clock\". \"Telephones\" broke using a telephone into several discrete steps, each reenacted by multiple films, similar to sequences in \"The Clock\" where the act of sleeping or waking is demonstrated by one character after another. His 1998 film \"Up and Out\" combines video from Michelangelo Antonioni's \"Blowup\" with audio from Brian De Palma's \"Blow Out\". It was an early experiment in the effect of synchronization, where viewers naturally attempted to find intersections between the two works, and it developed the editing style that Marclay employs for \"The Clock\". His 2002 installation \"Video Quartet\" is a 13-minute video with four continuous screens of clips from commercial films. Its combinations of coinciding sounds and images were a model for the synchronicity of \"The Clock\".\n\n\"The Clock\" has been viewed as an extension of similar compilations, particularly by Christoph Girardet. Girardet's 1999 \"Phoenix Tapes\", a collaboration with Matthias Müller, is composed of footage from Alfred Hitchcock's films. It arranges them into clusters to illustrate Hitchcock's techniques and motifs. Girardet and Müller use low-quality footage from VHS tapes to draw attention to their appropriation. In contrast, Marclay seeks to replicate Hollywood production through high-quality footage with standardised sound production and aspect ratios. Girardet's 2003 work \"60 Seconds (analog)\" is a 60-second film intended to be played on a loop. 60 brief shots show the hands of watches and clocks counting the seconds. Girardet wanted to show how interchangeable the cinema footage could be. Müller described it as \"The Clock\" \"in a conceptual, minimalist nutshell.\" In 2005 Étienne Chambaud presented \"L'Horloge\", a piece of software that displays the time using images of clocks in films. Chambaud's use of still images give \"L'Horloge\" a slower, more regular pace, whereas \"The Clock\" experiments with the rhythm of commercial films.\n\n\nSome text for this article was copied from article Christian Marclay.\n"}

His passion led him to focus more on drawing than on school, and at the age of 9, he began to study classical dance. By 14, he joined the ballet corps for the Rhin Opera (Opéra national du Rhin).\n\nAt the same time, Mugler began formal interior design training at the Strasbourg School of Decorative Arts.\n\nAt the age of 24, Mugler moved to Paris, France. He began designing clothes for Parisian boutique, Gudule. At 26, Mugler, who was working as a freelance designer, began to design for a variety of large ready-to-wear fashion houses in Paris, Milan, London and Barcelona.\n\nIn 1973, Mugler created his first personal collection called \"Café de Paris\". The style of the collection was both sophisticated and urban. Melka Tréanton, a powerful fashion editor, helped to launch his career. In 1976, she asked him to show his work in Tokyo for an event organized by Shiseido. In 1978, he opened his first Paris boutique at the Place des Victoires in the 1er Arrondissement). At the same time, Thierry Mugler launched a fashion collection for men. For this collection, he reworked classical masculinity, giving it a definitively modern style. A clean, precise, structured cut which outlined a highly recognizable silhouette: prominent shoulders, both \"anatomical and classic\", for a dynamically slender look.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Thierry Mugler became an internationally recognized designer, and his collections garnered much commercial success. At the request of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, he completed his first haute couture collection in 1992.\n\nHe created the famous black dress worn by Demi Moore in the 1993 movie, \"Indecent Proposal\".\n\nHis clothes are identified by their style and their structure. Mugler, over the next two decades created a style that was very much of its time: it was strong, angular, and sometimes almost cruel. Shoulders were wide and padded; waists were wasp-like. Prints were banished: Mugler’s clothes came in solid, dominating colors. Collars had exaggerated points, or flame-like cutouts. The insect kingdom was a constant influence, as were the ladies and gentlemen of film noir. PVC was often used as his material for his runway pieces, used to create space and robot themes.\n\nMugler published his first photography book in 1988, \"Thierry Mugler, Photographe\". This was followed by a monograph in 1999 entitled, \"Fashion Fetish Fantasy\" which assembles photos of his creations.\n\nMugler also directs short films, advertising films and video clips. He regularly designs costumes for musical comedies, concerts, operas and the theatre (including Macbeth for the Comédie Française). He has worked with Robert Altman and George Michael (he directed the video for Michael's \"Too Funky\" in 1992). He also directed the first advertising film for one of his fragrances, Alien.\n\nIn 2002 Mugler collaborated with the Cirque du Soleil. He directed \"Extravaganza\", one of the scenes of Zumanity, and also created all of the costumes and the identity of the characters in the show.\n\nIn 2009, Mugler worked as artistic advisor to singer Beyoncé. He created the costumes for her \"I Am... World Tour\".\n\nIn 2016, Mugler created and directed the music video and staging for San Marino's Eurovision Song Contest entry I Didn't Know performed by Turkish singer Serhat.\n\nIn 2008 the Mugler's brand launched Thierry Mugler Beauty, a high-end line of cosmetics.\n\nIn September 2010 Nicola Formichetti was announced to be the Creative Director of the Thierry Mugler brand. He changed the brand name to MUGLER, removing the first name, and in January 2011 he launched the revival of the brand's menswear collection in collaboration with Romain Kremer.\n\nAn April 2010 \"New York Times\" story discussed Mugler's cosmetic transformation. \"[Mugler has] taken to calling himself Manfred and transformed his body...into what is apparently a 240-pound spectacle of muscle and nipple and tattoo...\"\n\nWith over two years of being the creative director of MUGLER, Formichetti announced in April 2013 that he and the fashion house will be parting ways. Formichetti left MUGLER in to work for the Italian brand Diesel.\n\nIn December 2013, House of Mugler announced David Koma as the artistic director.\n\nMugler’s first perfume appeared in 1992 and was called \"Angel\". \"Angel\" contains a combination of praline and chocolate mixed with a strong accord of patchouli. It would be a part of a new fragrance type called gourmand. The Angel bottle, a design in the shape of a faceted star, was created by the Brosse Master Glassmakers. Fans of the fragrance include Diana Ross, Barbara Walters, Eva Mendes, and Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn 1996 Mugler followed up Angel with a male version named Angel Men or A*Men. This fragrance includes notes of caramel, coffee, vanilla, patchouli, and honey.\n\nIn 2005, Alien was created, the second major Thierry Mugler fragrance. Also in 2005, Thierry Mugler launched the Thierry Mugler Perfume Workshops\", which are open to the general public and led by specialists of the perfumery and oenology world.\n\nAngel and Alien together produce about $280 million in sales annually.\n\nIn 2010, the fragrance Womanity was released by the house of Mugler.\n\nMugler's newest fragrance, Angel Muse, was released in 2015. \n\nIn 2006, Thierry Mugler completed a project for the launch of Tom Tykwer's film \"Perfume\". In collaboration with the IFF company, Thierry Mugler created a box set of fifteen compositions.\n\nDuring 2007, still following the metamorphosis theme, Mugler launched Mirror, Mirror, a collection of five fragrances, created as \"perfume-trickery\" to \"enhance one’s presence\".\n\nMugler is openly gay, and is a longtime bodybuilder.\n\n"}
{"id": "56001795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56001795", "title": "Tomb of Philippe Pot", "text": "Tomb of Philippe Pot\n\nThe Tomb of Philippe Pot is a 15th-century funerary monument commissioned by Philippe Pot (d. 1493), royal steward of Burgundy under Louis XI, between c. 1477–80 for his burial at the chapel of Saint-Jean-Baptiste in Cîteaux Abbey, south of Dijon. \n\nIt consists of eight life-sized pleurants, represented as solemn and hooded pallbearers carrying Philippe's recumbent effigy towards its final resting place. Made of polychromed limestone, paint, gold and lead, it measures 181 (width) x 260 (height) x 167 (depth) cm. No definitive attributions have been made as to the artists and craftsmen who created the work, but Antoine Le Moiturier is often suggested to have produced the mourners. \n\nThe tomb was plundered during the French revolution, and in the 19th century positioned in private gardens in hotels in Dijon. It has been in the collection of the Musée du Louvre since 1899, where it is on permanent display.\n\nPhilip the Bold (1363–1404) commissioned the first of the Burgundian tombs in the latter part of the 14th century, hiring Claus Sluter as sculptor, whose distinctive style in which many small pleurants are positioned surrounding the effigy, was copied for the next century. Philippe Pot (1428–1493), royal stewart and seneschal to the Dukes of Burgundy, was raised at the Burgundian court, where he was educated. His tomb follows the tradition of the earliest ducal tombs, with Sluter's influence evident in the presence of mourners – or pleurants. As art historian Donna Sadler writes, a century after Sluter's work, in Pot's tomb \"the \"pleurants\" have taken steroids and become life-sized, bearing the effigy upon their shoulders\".\n\nPhilippe Pot reposes on a limestone plate or slab, and is dressed in a Knightly helmet and armor with a gilded breastplate. His head rests on a cushion, his eyes are open and his hands are clasped in prayer. A sword lies to his side while a lion rests at his feet. The mourners, whose carved forms seem influenced by the Dutch sculptor Claus Sluter, are carved in black stone, and dressed full length black hooded habits. Each bows their head in grief, and each bears an individually designed gilded heraldic shield, which may refer to Philippe's lineage, making the monument of the \"Kinship tomb\" type. The tomb is in good condition, but has been restored in places; a 19th century engraving shows Philippe's hands broken apart. \n\nIts style and scale became influential, because the sculptor transformed the size and placement of\"pleurants\", which had been relatively small figures standing in niches around the sarcophagus. Its influence is evidenced by the similar tombs of Louis de Savoisy (d. 1515) and Jacques de Mâlain (d. 1527).\n\nThe monument was commissioned to stand over Philippe's grave in the north arm of the chapel's transept. The artists and craftsmen involved in its production have not been identified, although the French sculptor Antoine Le Moiturier is often suggested as likely to have created the pleurants, based on the facial types and according to art historian Colum Hourihane the \"unusually rigid drapery\". Guillaume Chandelier has also been suggested as involved, but there is little concrete evidence.\n\nThe tomb was seized by the state during the French Revolution, and sold in 1791 to the Duleu Society and Dardelin of Dijon. It was acquired in 1808 by Charles Richard de Vesvrotte, lord of Ruffey-lès-Beaune, following a legal case against the state. De Vesvrotte placed the tomb in the garden of his hôtel particulier (mansion) in Dijon, the Hôtel Petit de Ruffey. He then temporarily moved it to a castle grounds in his possession, and then relocated to another of his mansion's gardens. It passed to the French National Collections in 1899.\n\n"}

Written by Charles Underwood and first released on record by Warren Smith in 1956, the song did not chart, but went on to become a rockabilly standard, covered by many artists. \"Ubangi Stomp\" – usually Smith's recording – appears on many compilation albums, including \"The Sun Records Collection\" and \"The Best of Bob Dylan's Theme Time Radio Hour\".\n\n\"Ubangi Stomp\" is a straightforward uptempo rock and roll song; the lyrics, of no great literary depth (\"\"Ubangi stomp ubangi style / When the beat just drives a cool cat wild\"), tell in first person the story of a sailor who goes to Africa (\"I rocked through Africa and... Seen them cats doin' the Ubangi stomp\") and, enamored of the local music and dance, jumps ship to go native (\"Then the captain said son, we gotta go / I said that's alright, you go right ahead / I'm gonna Ubangi-stomp 'till I roll over dead\"\"). Some mixing of cultural stereotypes is seen when supposed Native American terms (\"heap big\", tom-tom) are mixed into the ostensibly African setting.\n\nThe Ubangi Stomp Festival, an annual international exposition of America roots and rockabilly music, takes its name from the song, as does the Ubangi Stomp Club, a Dublin organization that organizes and promotes roots concerts and gigs.\n\nSaxophonist Earl Bostic released an instrumental piece titled \"Ubangi Stomp\" in 1954, but this has no relation to Underwood's song beyond the title.\n\n\nThe song has been covered by many other artists, including the Juke Joints (on their album \"20 years\"), the Top Cats (on their album \"Full Throttle Rockabilly\"), The Slippers (on their album \"Ubangi Stomp\"), The Sundowners (on the B-side of their 1959 single \"Snake Eyed Woman\"), The Velaires (on the B-side of their 1961 single \"It's Almost Tomorrow\"), Bobby Taylor (on the B-side of his 1962 single \"Seven Steps to an Angel\"), and others. Rory Storm and the Hurricanes recorded the song at Abbey Road Studios in 1964, but this version was never released.\n\nFoghat recorded a version during the sessions for their first album, \"Foghat\", but the song was not included on the album. It was included on their 1992 compilation \"Best of Foghat Volume 2\" and on their \"The Definitive Rock Collection\" in 2006.\n"}

While these systems can produce both electronically viewable and hard-copy (print) output, the \"variable-data publishing\" term today often distinguishes output destined for electronic viewing, rather than that which is destined for hard-copy print (e.g. variable data printing).\n\nEssentially the same techniques are employed to perform variable-data publishing, as those utilized with variable data printing. The difference is in the interpretation for output. While variable-data printing may be interpreted to produce various print streams or page-description files (e.g. AFP/IPDS, PostScript, PCL), variable-data publishing produces electronically viewable files, most commonly seen in the forms of PDF, HTML, or XML.\n\nVariable-data composition involves the use of data to conditionally:\n\nVariable-data may be as simple as an address block or salutation. However, it can be any or all of the document's textual content—including words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, or the entire document. In other words, it can make up as little or as much of the document as the composer desires. Variable data may also be used to exhibit various images, such as logos, products, or membership photos. Further, variable-data can be used to build rule-based design schemes, including fonts, colors, and page formats. The possibilities are vast.\n\nThe variable-data tools available today, make it possible to perform variable-data composition at nearly every stage of document production. However, the level of control that can be achieved varies, based upon how far into the document production process a variable-data tool is deployed. For example, if variable-data insertion occurs just prior to output...it's not likely that the text flow or layout can be altered with nearly as much control as would be available at the time of initial document composition.\n\nMany organizations will produce multiple forms of output (aka: multi-channel output), for the same document. This ensures that the published content is available to recipients via any form of access method they might require. When multi-channel output is utilized, integrity between those output channels often becomes important.\n\nVariable-data publishing may be performed on everything from a personal computer to a mainframe system. However, the speed and practical output volumes which can be achieved are directly affected by the computer power utilized.\n\nThe term variable-data publishing was likely an offshoot of the term \"variable-data printing\", first introduced to the printing industry by Frank Romano, Professor Emeritus, School of Print Media, at the College of Imaging Arts and Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology. However, the concept of merging static document elements and variable document elements predates the term and has seen various implementations ranging from simple desktop 'mail merge', to complex mainframe applications in the financial and banking industry. In the past, the term VDP has been most closely associated with digital printing machines. However, in the past 3 years the application of this technology has spread to web pages, emails, and mobile messaging.\n\n"}
