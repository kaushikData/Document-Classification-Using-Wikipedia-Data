{"id": "2462780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2462780", "title": "17th-century French art", "text": "17th-century French art\n\n17th-century French art is generally referred to as Baroque, but from the mid to late 17th century, the style of French art shows a classical adherence to certain rules of proportion and sobriety uncharacteristic of the Baroque as it was practiced in most of the rest of Europe during the same period.\n\nIn the early part of the 17th century, late mannerist and early Baroque tendencies continued to flourish in the court of Marie de' Medici and Louis XIII. Art from this period shows influences from both the north of Europe (Dutch and Flemish schools) and from Roman painters of the Counter-Reformation. Artists in France frequently debated the merits between Peter Paul Rubens (the Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors) and Nicolas Poussin (rational control, proportion, Roman classicism).\n\nThere was also a strong Caravaggio school represented in the period by the candle-lit paintings of Georges de La Tour. The wretched and the poor were featured in an almost Dutch manner in the paintings by the three Le Nain brothers. In the paintings of Philippe de Champaigne there are both propagandistic portraits of Louis XIII' s minister Cardinal Richelieu and other more contemplative portraits of people in the Jansenist sect.\n\nHowever, under Louis XIV, the Baroque as it was practiced in Italy was not in French taste (Bernini's famous proposal for redesigning the Louvre was rejected by Louis XIV.) Through propaganda, wars and great architectural works, Louis XIV launched a vast program designed for the glorification of France and his name. The Palace of Versailles, initially a tiny hunting lodge built by his father, was transformed by Louis XIV into a marvelous palace for fêtes and parties. Architect Louis Le Vau, painter and designer Charles Le Brun and the landscape architect André Le Nôtre created marvels : fountains danced; wandering revelers discovered hidden grottos in the gardens.\n\nThe initial impetus for this transformation of Versailles is generally linked to the private château Vaux-le-Vicomte built for Louis XIV's minister of Finance Nicolas Fouquet. Having offered a lavish festival for the king in the newly finished residence in 1661 (Le Brun, Le Vau, Le Nôtre, the poet La Fontaine, the playwright Molière were all under Fouquet's patronage), the minister was accused of misappropriation of funds and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The architects and artists under his patronage were all put to work on Versailles.\n\nIn this period, Louis' minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert established royal control over artisanal production in France; henceforth France would no longer purchase luxury goods from abroad, but would, herself, set the standard for quality. This control was also seen in the creation of an academy of painting and sculpture, which maintained a hierarchy of genres in painting (the \"noblest,\" according to André Félibien in 1667, being history painting), a strong use of pictorial rhetoric, and a strict sense of decorum in subject matter.\n\nFurnishings and interior designs from this period are referred to as \"Louis XIV-style\"; the style is characterized by weighty brocades of red and gold, thickly gilded plaster molding, large sculpted sideboards, and heavy marbling.\n\nIn 1682 Versailles was transformed into the official residence of the king; eventually the Hall of Mirrors was built; other smaller \"châteaux\", like the Grand Trianon, were built on the grounds, and a huge canal featuring gondolas and gondoliers from Venice was created.\n\nThrough his wars and the glory of Versailles, Louis became, to a certain degree, the arbiter of taste and power in Europe and both his \"château\" and the etiquette in Versailles were copied by the other European courts. Yet the difficult wars at the end of his long reign and the religious problems created by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes made his last years dark ones.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4599570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4599570", "title": "Cambodian art", "text": "Cambodian art\n\nThe history of Cambodian art stretches back centuries to ancient times, but the most famous period is undoubtedly the Khmer art of the Khmer Empire (802–1431), especially in the area around Angkor and the mainly 12th-century temple-complex of Angkor Wat, initially Hindu and subsequently Buddhist. After the collapse of the empire these and other sites were abandoned and overgrown, allowing much of the era's stone carving and architecture to survive to the present day. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include textiles, non-textile weaving, silversmithing, stone carving, lacquerware, ceramics, wat murals, and kite-making. \n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the Khmer Rouge. The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.\n\nIn pre-colonial Cambodia, art and crafts were generally produced either by rural non-specialists for practical use or by skilled artists producing works for the Royal Palace. In modern Cambodia, many artistic traditions entered a period of decline or even ceased to be practiced, but the country has experienced a recent artistic revival as the tourist market has increased and governments and NGOs have contributed to the preservation of Cambodian culture.\n\nCambodia's best-known stone carving adorns the temples of Angkor, which are \"renowned for the scale, richness and detail of their sculpture\". In modern times, however, the art of stone carving became rare, largely because older sculptures survived undamaged for centuries (eliminating the need for replacements) and because of the use of cement molds for modern temple architecture. By the 1970s and 1980s, the craft of stone carving was nearly lost.\n\nDuring the late 20th century, however, efforts to restore Angkor resulted in a new demand for skilled stone carvers to replace missing or damaged pieces, and a new tradition of stone carving is arising to meet this need. Most modern carving is traditional-style, but some carvers are experimenting with contemporary designs. Interest is also renewing for using stone carving in modern wats. Modern carvings are typically made from Banteay Meanchey sandstone, though stone from Pursat and Kompong Thom is also used.\n\nBecause of destruction during recent war, few historic wat murals remain in Cambodia. In the 1960s, art historians Guy and Jacqueline Nafilyan photographed 19th-century murals, providing a record of this lost cultural heritage. The best known surviving murals are at the Silver Pagoda in Phnom Penh, Wat Rajabo in Siem Reap province, and Wat Kompong Tralach Leu in Kompong Chhnang Province. In the last decade, wat murals have seen a resurgence, but Cambodia's surviving older murals are generally more refined and detailed.\n\nSilk weaving in Cambodia has a long history. The practice dates to as early as the 1st century, and textiles were used in trade during Angkorian times. Even modern textile production evidences these historic antecedents: motifs found on silk today often echo clothing details on ancient stone sculptures.\n\nThere are two main types of Cambodian weaving. The ikat technique (Khmer: \"chong kiet\"), which produces patterned fabric, is quite complex. To create patterns, weavers tie-dye portions of weft yarn before weaving begins. Patterns are diverse and vary by region; common motifs include lattice, stars, and spots. The second weaving technique, unique to Cambodia, is called \"uneven twill\". It yields single or two-color fabrics, which are produced by weaving three threads so that the \"color of one thread dominates on one side of the fabric, while the two others determine the colour on the reverse side.\" Traditionally, Cambodian textiles have employed natural dyes. Red dye comes from lac insect nests, blue dye from indigo, yellow and green dye from prohut bark, and black dye from ebony bark.\n\nCambodia's modern silk-weaving centers are Takeo, Battambang, Beanteay Meanchey, Siem Reap and Kampot provinces. Silk-weaving has seen a major revival recently, with production doubling over the past ten years. This has provided employment for many rural women. Cambodian silk is generally sold domestically, where it is used in \"sampot\" (wrap skirts), furnishings, and \"pidan\" (pictoral tapestries), but interest in international trade is increasing.\n\nCotton textiles have also played a significant role in Cambodian culture. Though today Cambodia imports most of its cotton, traditionally woven cotton remains popular. Rural women often weave homemade cotton fabric, which is used in garments and for household purposes. Krama, the traditional check scarves worn almost universally by Cambodians, are made of cotton.\n\nMany Cambodian farmers weave baskets (Khmer: tbanh kantrak) for household use or as a supplemental source of income. Most baskets are made of thinly cut bamboo. Regions known for basketry include Siem Reap and Kampong Cham. Mat weaving (tbanh kantuel) is a common seasonal occupation. They are most commonly made from reeds, either left a natural tan color or dyed in deep jewel tones. The region of Cambodia best known for mat weaving is the Mekong floodplain, especially around Lvea Em district. Mats are commonly laid out for guests and are important building materials for homes. Wicker and rattan crafts (tbanh kanchoeu) made from dryandra trees are also significant. Common wicker and rattan products include walls, mats, furniture, and other household items.\n\nThe height of Cambodian traditional lacquerware was between the 12th and 16th centuries; some examples of work from this era, including gilded Buddha images and betel boxes, have survived to the present day. Lacquerware was traditionally colored black using burnt wood, representing the underworld; red using mercury, representing the earth; and yellow using arsenic, representing the heavens. Lacquer on Angkorian stone dates to the 15th or 16th century.\n\nIn modern Cambodia, the art of lacquerwork nearly faded into oblivion: few lacquer trees survived, and lacquer was unavailable in local markets. Today's revival is still in its infancy, but 100 lacquer artists have been trained by a French expert under the guidance of Artisans d'Angkor, a company that produces traditional crafts in village workshops. Some artists are \"beginning to experiment with different techniques and styles...to produce modern and striking effects.\"\n\nSilversmithing in Cambodia dates back centuries. The Royal Palace traditionally patronized silversmiths' workshops, and silversmiths remain concentrated at Kompong Luong, near the former royal capital Oudong. Silver was made into a variety of items, including weaponry, coins, ceremonial objects used in funerary and religious rituals, and betel boxes. During Cambodia's colonial period, artisans at the School of Fine Art produced celebrated silverwork, and by the late 1930s there were more than 600 silversmiths. Today, silverwork is popular for boxes, jewellery, and souvenir items; these are often adorned with fruit, fire, and Angkor-inspired motifs. Men produce most of the forms for such work, but women often complete the intricate filigree.\n\nCambodian pottery traditions date to 5000 BCE. Ceramics were mostly used for domestic purposes such as holding food and water. There is no evidence that Khmer ceramics were ever exported, though ceramics were imported from elsewhere in Asia beginning in the 10th century. Ceramics in the shape of birds, elephants, rabbits, and other animals were popular between the 11th and 13th centuries.\n\nPotting traditionally was done either on a pottery wheel or using shaping tools such as paddles and anvils. Firing was done in clay kilns, which could reach temperatures of 1,000–1,200 °C, or in the open air, at temperatures of around 700 °C. Primarily green and brown glazes were used. In rural Cambodia, traditional pottery methods remained. Many pieces are hand-turned and fired on an open fire without glaze. The country's major center for pottery is Kompong Chhnang Province.\n\nIn modern Cambodia, the art of glazed ceramics faded into oblivion: the technique of stoneware stop to be used around 14th century, at the end of Angkor era. Today this technique begin a slow revival through a Belgian ceramist who founded the Khmer Ceramics & Fine Arts Center, in Siem Reap, the organization lead vocational training and researches about this lost skill.\n\nCambodia's kite-making and kite-flying tradition, which dates back many centuries, was revived in the early 1990s and is now extremely popular throughout the country. Kites (Khmer: khleng ek) are generally flown at night during the northeast monsoon season. A bow attached to the kites resonates in the wind, producing a musical sound.\n\nCambodia's tradition of modern (representational) drawing, painting, and sculpture was established in the late 1940s at the School of Cambodian Arts (later called the University of Fine Arts), where it occupied much of the school's curriculum a decade later. These developments were supported by the government, which encouraged new areas of specialization (e.g. design and modern painting) at the school and purchased modern art for the Prime Minister's residences and for government buildings. Galleries opened in Phnom Penh during the 1960s, and cultural centers hosted exhibitions of modern paintings and provided art libraries. One important painter of the 1960s was Nhek Dim; he has become the painter of reference for modern painters. During the subsequent Khmer Rouge era, many artists were killed and art production nearly ceased.\n\nAfter the fall of the Khmer Rouge, artists and professors returned the University of Fine Arts to rebuild arts training. Socialist Bloc governments sponsored the education of young art students in Poland, Bulgaria, the former Soviet Union, and Hungary during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Other local efforts aimed to re-establish workshops, collect documents, and preserve traditional knowledge.\n\nThough several galleries present changing exhibitions in Phnom Penh, the vast majority of artists cannot support themselves through exhibitions and sales of modern work. Artists generally earn income from Angkor-inspired art for tourists or from painting commercial signs and large reproductions that in the West would be mechanically produced.\n\nSeveral broad schools of art exist among modern Cambodian artists. Some artists, including Som Samai (a silversmith), An Sok (a mask-maker), and Chet Chan (a painter) follow colonial traditions to produce traditional Khmer art. Chhim Sothy's work is also derived from these traditions. Many young artists who studied abroad in the 1980s, including Phy Chan Than, Soeung Vannara, Long Sophea, and Prom Sam An, have presented a modern Khmer art forms combining subjects from Khmer art with Western modernism. Other notable Cambodian artists include Leang Seckon, Pich Sopheap, Svay Ken, Asasax, Chhan Dina, Patrick Samnang Mey, Lam Soeung, and Chhorn Bun Son. During the 1990s, Cambodia saw the return of many members of the Khmer diaspora, including several internationally recognized artists. Among these are Marine Ky and Chath Piersath.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22402195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22402195", "title": "Chilean literature", "text": "Chilean literature\n\nChilean literature refers to all written or literary work produced in Chile or by Chilean writers. The literature of Chile is usually written in Spanish.\nChile has a rich literary tradition and has been home to two Nobel prize winners, the poets Gabriela Mistral and Pablo Neruda. It has also seen three winners of the Miguel de Cervantes Prize, considered one of the most important Spanish language literature prizes: the novelist, journalist and diplomat Jorge Edwards (1998), and the poets Gonzalo Rojas (2003) and Nicanor Parra (2011).\nAs the native cultures of the territories known today as Chile had no written tradition, (please see Mapudungun alphabet), Chilean literature was born during the Spanish conquest of the 1500s. The conquistador Pedro de Valdivia wrote letters to the king, Charles V (Carlos Primero de España), and in one of these letters, of 1554, he admiringly describes the natural beauty and landscape of the country. Along with the conquerors came missionaries to teach and convert the native peoples to Christianity, spreading not only their religion but also their language, writing and other arts and artisan skills. Chilean literature in the time of the Spanish conquest consisted mainly of chronicles of the war of Arauco. Most soldiers with the ability to write had to use the sword more often than the pen, so during the conquest and colonisation, the main role of literature was to keep historical records of the campaign. One exception to this, however, was the poem La Araucana, published in Spain in 1569, 1578, and 1589 and also known as \"The Araucaniad\". La Araucana, written by Alonso de Ercilla, is the most significant epic poem in the modern Spanish language and is one of the most important works of the Spanish Golden Age (Siglo de Oro), describing the conquest of Chile in hendecasyllable verse. Later, Pedro de Oña, the first poet born in Chile, published an imitation of Ercilla, \"El Arauco domado\" or The Tamed Arauco in 1596.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, historical work prevailed, including \"Historia del Reino de Chile\" (History of the Realm of Chile) by Alonso de Góngora Marmolejo, \"Histórica relación del Reino de Chile\" (Historical Account of the Realm of Chile) by Alonso de Ovalle; and \"Cautiverio feliz\" (Happy Captivity) by Francisco Núñez de Pineda y Bascuñán. This period also saw scientific writers like Juan Ignacio Molina, who wrote the \"Ensayo sobre la Historia Natural de Chile\" (An Essay on the Natural History of Chile), and the epic historical poem \"El Purén indómito\" (The Indomitable Purén), written by Fernando Álvarez de Toledo.\n\nDuring the colonial period until the 19th century, literary works written by Chilean nuns spotlighted: there were spiritual letters, diaries, autobiographies and epistolaries; several writers stood out, including Tadea de San Joaquín, Úrsula Suárez and Josefa de los Dolores, whose works became the best known of its kind in the South American region.\n\nThe excitement of the independence movement inspired Camilo Henríquez to launch \"La Aurora de Chile\" (The Dawn of Chile), Chile's first newspaper or printing operation of any kind, mostly covering politics and political philosophy. It was in print from February 13, 1812 to April 1, 1813, at which point it became El Monitor Araucano. The paper had four printed pages with two columns each, and was published weekly, every Thursday. Other journalists of the period included Manuel de Salas, José Miguel Infante, Juan Egaña Risco and Antonio José de Irisarri. In the following years, Mercedes Marín del Solar wrote the poem \"Canto fúnebre a la muerte de don Diego Portales\" (Dirge for the death of Don Diego Portales), and glimpses of drama appeared with Manuel Magallanes and his \"La Hija del Sur\" (The Daughter of the South). Critics have seen the period as one of very active and enthusiastic writers, but with limited artistic technique.\n\nRomanticism in Chile can be classified in three literary generations, according to the critic Cedomil Goic: the 1837 generation, the 1842 generation and the 1867 generation, the latter of which had many parallels with realism and is considered by some critics to actually be part of the realist movement.\n\nMade up of writers born between 1800 and 1814 and also known as the \"Generación Costumbrista\", the 1837 generation developed a literary interpretation of local everyday life and manners.\n\nIts main feature was a special emphasis on observing the picturesque and local, approaching it from a satirical and critical point of view. The group included Mercedes Marin del Solar, Vicente Pérez Rosales and José Joaquín Vallejo.\n\nMade up of writers born between 1815 and 1829, this group was also known as the \"Romantic-social\" generation. Like their predecessors, they portrayed everyday life but added an extra layer of social critique to their work. The group were influenced by foreign intellectuals in Chile such as José Joaquín de Mora, Andrés Bello, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Vicente Fidel López and made the first attempts to found a characteristically Chilean national literature movement. The poetry of this generation resembled European Romanticism in style and included Salvador Sanfuentes' \"Inami\", Guillermo Matta Goyenechea's \"Poesías líricas\" (Lyrical poems), Guillermo Blest Gana's \"Armonías\" (Harmonies) and José Antonio Soffia's \"Hojas de otoño\". Narrative literature had a more original style and included works such as José Victorino Lastarria's \"Peregrinación de una vinchuca\"; Alberto Blest Gana's \"Durante la reconquista\" (During the reconquest) and \"El loco Estero\" (Estero the Mad, 1909); José Joaquín Vallejo's \"Artículos de costumbres\" (Essays on customs); Vicente Pérez Rosales' \"Recuerdos del pasado\" (Memories of the past); and Daniel Riquelme's \"Bajo la tienda\" (Under canvas). Dramatic works of the period included Daniel Caldera's \"El tribunal del honor\" (The court of honor).\n\nFrom 1850, great historical works emerged such as Diego Barros Arana's \"Historia general de Chile\" (General history of Chile), Miguel Luis Amunátegui's \"Descubrimiento y conquista de Chile\" (Discovery and conquest of Chile), Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna's \"El ostracism de O'Higgins\" (The ostracism of O'Higgins) and Ramón Sotomayor Valdés' \"Historia de Chile durante 40 años\" (40 years of Chilean history).\n\nIn 1886, the Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío moved to Valparaíso, Chile, where he stayed with fellow poets Poirier and Eduardo de la Barra. Together they co-authored a sentimental novel titled \"Emelina\". Although the novel was not an immediate success, Rubén Darío is credited with the re-emergence of Chilean lyric poetry with \"Azul\" (Blue) in 1888. This was followed by Carlos Pezoa Véliz' \"Entierro de campo\" (Country funeral) and \"Tarde en el hospital\" (Afternoon in the hospital), and Manuel Magallanes Moure's \"La casa junto al mar\" (Seaside house) and others. Carlos Pezoa Véliz only became famous after his early death at the age of 28.\n\nThe generation of 1867\n\nRealist writers depicted everyday and banal activities and experiences instead of the more traditional romanticized or stylized representations, distinguishing them from their predecessors.\nThis movement was made up of writers born between 1830 and 1844. Alberto Blest Gana is considered a pioneer of realist style in Chile, starting with \"Martín Rivas\" in 1862, a portrait of the Chilean society of the time. Blest Gana describes what he saw as positive changes in Chilean society, which, at the time, was moving towards capitalism. He believed it was inevitable that local traditions would disappear and be replaced with European customs, and felt that opposition to these changes was old-fashioned and futile. In contrast, fellow writer Luis Orrego Luco observed the transformations with sadness and denounced the moral consequences of this process of change. The opposing views of Blest Gana and Orrego Luco are the most important representation of the realism movement in Chile.\nOther important writers of the generation were Daniel Barros Grez, Eduardo de la Barra, Zorobabel Rodríguez, José Antonio Soffia, Moisés Vargas and Liborio Brieba.\nDuring this period, narrative literature advanced more than poetry or drama, although the construction of new theatres encouraged some development in the latter. Important theatres include the Victoria in Valparaíso, inaugurated in 1844, the República in Santiago, inaugurated in 1848, and Teatro Municipal de Santiago, inaugurated in 1857.\n\nAlso known as Costumbrismo, Criollismo was a literary movement that was active from the end of the 19th century to the first half of the twentieth century. An extension of Realism, it portrayed the scenes, customs and manners of the writer's country, with some hints of patriotism. The first centenary of Chilean independence in 1910 fed the patriotic spirit of the nation and its writers, and saw a renewed emphasis of rural life in contrast to the traditional focus on urban life as the only source and background of stories. In prose literature, Baldomero Lillo's \"Sub Terra\" and \"Sub Sole\" were among the most important, as well as Mariano Latorre's \"Zurzulita\" and \"Cuna de cóndores\" (Cradle of condors) and Federico Gana's \"Días de campo\" (Country days). Key drama works included Antonio Acevedo Hernández' \"Árbol Viejo\" (Old Tree), and \"Chañarcillo\".\n\nDuring the first quarter of twentieth century, a new Chilean literary scene emerged: an Avant-garde movement.\nThe first manifestation of this movement was \"Flores de cardo\" (Thistle flowers) by Pedro Prado in 1908, a work that broke with metric restraints and the rules of poetry. Prado also published \"El llamado del mundo\" (The call of the world) and \"Los pájaros errantes\" (The wandering birds) in 1913 and 1915, and founded artistic group \"Los Diez\" with architect Julio Bertrand. in 1916.\n\nOn December 22, 1914, Gabriela Mistral - who would later win the Nobel Prize in Literature - won the \"Juegos Florales de Santiago\" poetry contest, her first recognition as a great talent. In 1919, Gabriela Mistral published \"Desolación\", the work that won her the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1945. \"Desolación\", \"Tala\", \"Lagar\" were some of her most important poetic works.\nIn 1914, Vicente Huidobro published \"Arte del sugerimiento\" (The art of suggestion) and \"Non serviam\", two works that initiated the Creacionismo movement which saw a poem as a truly new thing, created by the author for the sake of itself. Huidrobro published the \"manifesto\" of the movement in his book \"El espejo de agua\" (The water mirror) in 1916.\nÁngel Cruchaga, another poet of this generation, took \"love\" as his main topic and was known for the sadness of his poems. In 1915, he published \"Las manos juntas\" (Holding hands), his most characteristic work.\nPablo de Rokha used poetry to portray his anarchic, combative and controversial view of the world. Key works include \"El folletín del Diablo\" and \"Los gemidos\", published in 1920 and 1922 respectively. In 1938, Pablo de Rokha founded and managed the publishing house \"Multitud\", which distributed books in the United States, Russia and Latin America.\nAlso in this period, between 1914 and 1925, Juan Guzmán Cruchaga published \"Junto al brasero\" (Beside the brazier), \"La mirada inmóvil\" (The motionless gaze), \"Lejana\" (Far), \"La fiesta del corazón\" (Party of the heart), and the anthology \"Agua de cielo\" (Water of heaven).\n\nDuring the 20th century, neo-modernist and avant-garde Chilean poets found fame beyond Chilean borders. Gabriela Mistral won the first Latin American Nobel Prize of Literature, followed by fellow Chilean Pablo Neruda. The father of the Creacionismo movement, Vicente Huidobro, also contributed to the internationalization of Chilean literature.\n\nPablo Neruda published the works \"Crepusculario\" and \"Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada\" in 1923 and 1924, as a prelude to the great success he would have in the next quarter century.\n\nChilean Imagism was a literary trend that started in 1925 in opposition to Criollismo, which it accused of being nationalist, narrow and lacking imagination. Imaginist writers moved away from the elements used as inspiration by previous generations (everyday life, rural life and the fight against nature).\nThe Imaginist group, made up of writers Ángel Cruchaga Santa María, Salvador Reyes, Hernán del Solar, Luis Enrique Délano and Manuel Eduardo Hübner, broke with the most prominent literary critics of the time. Luis Enrique Délano said in an article about the origin of the Imagism: \"We had not decided to innovate at all, but we had a common sense that Chilean literature was full of \"Criollismo\", cloying and heavy.\n\nOne achievement of the Imaginist group, along with some of the most prominent criollista writers, was the creation the magazine \"Letras\". Although the editorial line of the magazine was imaginist, important criollista writers collaborated and it aimed to create an international dialogue about art and literature. Contributors included Augusto d'Halmar, Mariano Latorre, Marta Brunet, Luis Durand, Rosamel del Valle, Juan Marín and Jacobo Danke among others.\n\n\"La Mandrágora\" (Spanish for \"The Mandrake\") was a Chilean Surrealist group founded on 12 July 1938 by Braulio Arenas (1913–1988), Teófilo Cid, Enrique Gómez Correa and Jorge Cáceres (who was still a teenager at the time). The group met in Talca and by 1932, Braulio Arenas was exchanging ideas with Teófilo Cid and Enrique Gómez. By 1935, these ideas had become more developed, and in 1938, they held a kind of initiation ceremony reading surrealist poems and texts at the University of Chile. They went on to publish a magazine called, like the group, \"La Mandrágora\" (seven issues were produced on a small scale, from December 1938 to October 1943), as well as anthology of poetry, \"El AGC de la Mandrágora\", (The AGC of the Mandrake) which included works by all founders except Teófilo Cid. Politically, the group supported the Popular Front.\nAmong the main achievements of this group was the publication of \"La Mandrágora\", which promoted the surrealist movement in Chile; a conference held at the University of Chile in 1939, a surrealist exhibition held in the Biblioteca Nacional de Chile (national library of Chile) in 1941, and an international surrealist exposition in Galleria Dédalo in Santiago in 1948. Braulio Arenas also published the magazine \"Leit-motiv\" from 1942 to 1943, with contributions from André Breton, Benjamin Péret and Aimé Césaire, linking \"La Mandrágora\" with the French surrealists.\n\nThey were known for their critique of modern Chilean poetry and Chilean writers like Pablo Neruda and Vicente Huidobro.\nThe group began to separate in 1949. In 1957, Braulio Arenas, Enrique Gómez Correa and Jorge Cáceres published the anthology \"El AGC de la Mandrágora\", which included a surrealist dictionary and a bibliography of the Chilean surrealism.\n\nThe first half of the 1940s saw the emergence of the \"Generación neocriollista de 1940\" (Neo Criollista Generation of 1940). The neocriollistas — a name that can be translated as \"neo traditionalist\" - put a great emphasis on local customs and wanted to portray the life of the common people in a social and human way. A key factor that influenced their ideology was the turbulent political times that they lived in, with group members committed to Marxism and left-wing political activism.\nOne of the most important writers of this generation was Nicomedes Guzmán, who was known for including social topic in his works, such as social and economic inequality, exploitation, misery in the suburban life, moral degradation in poverty, and corruption in power. Among his most important works were \"Los hombres oscuros\" (The dark men), \"La sangre y la esperanza\" (Blood and hope), \"La luz viene del mar\" (Light comes from the sea), and \"Una moneda al río y otros cuentos\" (A coin to the river and other tales), published in 1939, 1943, 1951 and 1954.\nOther key writers of the generation were:\n\nGonzalo Drago, with works like \"Cobre\" (Copper), a book of stories about the struggles and hard life of the miners, published in 1941; \"Surcos\" (Grooves), a collection of stories about peasants published in 1948; and \"El Purgatorio\" (Purgatory), a novel that describes the author's experiences as a conscript during military service, published in 1951.\nAndrés Sabella and Volodia Teitelboim, with their works \"Norte Grande\" (Big North) and \"Hijo del salitre\" (Son of saltpeter), both describing the lives of saltpeter miners in the north of Chile.\nFrancisco Coloane and Nicasio Tangol, who wrote about life in the extreme south of Chile. Nicasio Tangol revealed the traditions and myths of the southern island of Chiloe, Chilean Patagonia and the native peoples of that extreme region. Francisco Coloane described man's struggles in the southern seas in his works \"Cabo de Hornos\" and \"El último grumete de La Baquedano\" (Cape Hornos and The last boy of the Baquedano), both published in 1941.\nMaité Allamand and Marta Brunet who wrote work inspired by rural life. Brunet's play \"Montaña adentro\" (Into the mountain) is notable for its use of rural language and peasant slang to portray life in the country, while Allamand put special emphasis on children's literature and was one of the pioneers of this genre.\n\nThe first children's literature published in Chile date back to the period when the printing press was introduced in Chile around 1812. These texts were mainly educational and religious books, written mostly by Spanish priests in order to educate children.\nIt was in the early 20th century when several magazines for children were founded, including \"Revista de los Niños\" (The Kids' Magazine) in 1905, \"Chicos y Grandes\" (Kids and Grownups) in 1908, and \"El Penaca\" - the only one that lasted into the next decades. Around the same time, two children's books by Agustín Edwards Mac-Clure were published: \"Aventuras de Juan Esparraguito\" (The Adventures of Juan Little Asparagus ) and \"El niño casi legumbre\" (The Almost Bean Boy).\n\nAnother precursor of children's literature in Chile was Blanca Santa Cruz Ossa who compiled stories and myths from Chile and from other countries, including \"Cuentos rumanos\" (Romanian tales, 1929), \"Cuentos maravillosos del Japón\" (Marvellous tales from Japan, 1935), \"Cuentos de España\" (Tales from Spain, 1936), \"Cuentos Ingleses\" (English Tales,1936), \"Las hadas en Francia\" (Fairies in France, 1936), \"Leyendas de la selva\" (Legends of the Jungle, 1936), \"Leyendas moriscas\" (Moorish Legends, 1936), \"Cuentos mitológicos griegos\" (Greek myths and tales, 1937), \"Cuentos italianos\" (Italian stories, 1938), \"Cuentos servios\" (Serbian stories, 1939), \"Cuentos chinos\" (Chinese stories, 1940), \"Orejones y viracochas: Diego de Almagro\" (Big ears and Viracochas, 1943), \"Sangre y ceniza: narración novelesca de la conquista de Chile\" (Blood and ashes: fictional narrative of the conquest of Chile, illustrated by Coré, 1946), \"Cuentos chilenos\", (Chilean stories, with illustrations by Elena Poirier, 1956) \"Cuentos bretones\" (Breton tales, 1973), \"El duende del pantano y otros cuentos de Bretaña\" (The Swamp Troll and other tales of Britain).\n\nMaité Allamand, Carmen de Alonso and Marta Brunet also wrote children's literature inspired by Chilean folklore. Allamand produced works like \"Alamito el largo\" (The little long poplar, 1950) while Brunet wrote \"Cuentos para Marisol\" (Tales for Marisol, 1938) and \"Por qué el petirrojo tiene el pecho rojo\" (Why robins have a red chest, 1938). Around this time, Gabriela Mistral composed poetry dedicated to children, primarily in her works \"Tala\" and \"Ternura\".\n\nIn 1964, a subsidiary of IBBY (International Board on Books for Young People) was set up in Chile, bringing together a group of writers to promote literature for children and young people. Among the writers taking part were Marcela Paz (\"Papelucho\"), who was also the first director of the Chilean IBBY, Maité Allamand, Chela Reyes, Gabriela Lezaeta, María Silva Ossa, Amalia Réndic and Pepita Turina. Over the years, this organization became an important meeting place for writers and was a great promoter of children's and youth literature. Other important contributors to IBBY included Alicia Morel, Lucía Gevert, Cecilia Beuchat, María Eugenia Coeymans, Felipe Alliende, Víctor Carvajal, Saúl Schkolnik, Manuel Peña Muñoz, Héctor Hidalgo, Manuel Gallegos María Luisa Silva, Jacqueline Balcells and Ana María Güiraldes.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the study of history and historical literature in Chile saw profound changes, moving away from the tradition of the great 19th century liberal historians. This was due to a combination of factors, including the ideological struggles of the time and the gradual professionalization of historical studies through the creation of institutes and specialized departments in different universities of Chile.\n\nOne of the main trends was the influential conservative school that monopolised historic debate until the 1960s. Leading writers in the school included Jaime Eyzaguirre, with his \"Fisonomía histórica de Chile\" (Historic physiognomy of Chile), Francisco Antonio Encina with his \"Historia de Chile\" (History of Chile), and Alberto Edwards with \"Bosquejo histórico de los partidos políticos chilenos\" (Historical sketch of the Chilean political parties, 1903), \"La Fronda Aristocrática en Chile\" (The Aristocratic Fronde in Chile, 1928) and \"La Organización Política de Chile\" (The Political Organization of Chile, 1943). These writers produced a harsh critique of 19th-century social liberalism and the changes that had occurred since the 1920s, viewing these changes as a process of decadence. Conservative historians rejected modernity and proposed a substitution of representative democracy for authoritarian regimes to ensure the maintenance of social order and the Catholic faith.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, two new historical trends has emerged that competed with the conservative school. The first, Marxist trend focused its efforts on the reconstruction and recovery of the history of Chilean working class, with writers including Julio César Jobet and Hernán Ramírez Necochea. These authors were criticized for the political-ideological character of their work, though their legacy lived on through the later generation of the 1980s, who developed a new way of describing history focused on Chilean popular movements.\n\nThe second trend brought real innovation to the study of history, introducing new techniques and research methodologies borrowed from the new European historiography, particularly the French Annales School. Historians of this school included Mario Góngora, Álvaro Jara, Rolando Mellafe, and Sergio Villalobos among others. They focused on topics that had been neglected before like economics and demographics. The vast majority of these new researchers studied at the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile.\nThis new historiography movement put emphasis on the study of the long-running processes that had shaped the institutions, society and economy of Chile since colonial times. By the late 1960s, historians of this school had created links with the Marxist movement. The 1973 Chilean coup d'état put an abrupt end to this process and repressed the new social historiography, forcing these historians and researchers to flee the country. Many of them went to European universities to undertake postgraduate studies, which in the long term helped perfect their professional skills.\n\nAs a consequence of the vast changes during World War II, Chilean literature became more universal in its themes, focusing on problems common to the whole humanity and using new modes of expression. In the novel form, key works included Manuel Rojas' \"Hijo de ladrón\" (Son of a thief), María Luisa Bombal's \"La amortajada\" (The shrouded) and José Donoso's \"El obsceno pájaro de la noche\" (The obscene bird of the night). Key poetic works included Nicanor Parra's \"Poemas y antipoemas\" (Poems and antipoems), Humberto Díaz Casanueva's \"Réquiem\", Eduardo Anguita's \"Venus en el pudridero\" (Venus on the garbage heap), Gonzalo Rojas' \"Contra la muerte\" (Against death), Jorge Teillier's \"Muertes y maravillas\" (Deaths and wonders), Fernando González Urízar's \"Los signos del cielo\" (Signs from heaven), Miguel Arteche's \"Fénix de madrugada\", (Phoenix at dawn) and Raúl Zurita's \"Purgatorio\" (Purgatory). In drama, important works included Luis Alberto Heiremans' \"El tony chico\" (The small clown), Egon Wolff's \"Álamos en la azotea\" (Poplars on the roof), Jorge Díaz Gutiérrez' \"El cepillo de dientes\" (Toothbrush) and \"La cantante calva\" (The bald singer).\n\nFollowing the coup d'état of September 11, 1973, culture diminished in Chile. The coup forced many writers to emigrate, and after a while Chilean writers began to create publishing houses and magazines in their new homes in exile. Journals published by Chileans in exile included \"Araucaria\" in Spain, \"Literatura chilena en el exilio\" (Chilean literature in exile) in California and \"América Joven\" (Young America) in the Netherlands. The editorials \"Ediciones Cordillera\" in Canada, \"LAR\" and \"Ediciones Michay\" in Spain.\nChilean literature underwent a process of internationalization at this time, despite the fact that Chileans still living in Chile had lost their writers, along with most other forms of art. The mix of Magic realism and \"family saga\", for example, brought international fame to Antonio Skarmeta, Fernando Alegría, Gonzalo Rojas, Humberto Díaz Casanueva, Ariel Dorfman and Isabel Allende, Hernán Neira. In times of dictatorship and repression, Chilean literature contributed to raising international awareness about the situation in Chile. Virtually every major city in the western world was home to Chilean writers, many of whom denounced the regime of Augusto Pinochet.\n\nPossibly due to the diaspora of exile, Chilean literature during and after the dictatorship was not uniform in style. Young writers found themselves transplanted in a foreign culture, and it would take time for writers returning from exile to get used to the Chilean intellectual environment and form new groups. In poetry, there was the so-called \"Nueva poesia chilena\" (New Chilean poetry). This \"Nueva poesia chilena\" included a great number of poets coming back from exile in Europe, with Raul Zurita, Rodrigo Lira, Antonio Arévalo and Bruno Montané among the most famous.\n\nThe four greats of Chilean poetry was the group of most important poets of Chilean literature: Gabriela Mistral, Vicente Huidobro, Pablo de Rokha and Pablo Neruda.\n\nThese four poets were linked to each other or met each other at some point in their lives. For example, while Gabriela Mistral was head teacher at the Girls' High School in Temuco, Chile, and already recognized as an outstanding poet, a teenage boy came to her with his own poems, asking for her opinion. This teenager was Neftalí Reyes, who would later take the pseudonym of Pablo Neruda and become another great Chilean poet. He would also follow in Mistral's footsteps when he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1971, 26 years after Mistral herself had won the highest honor in literature in 1945.\n\nIn contrast to this tenuous link, the relationship between Huidobro, De Rokha and Neruda was one of the most persistent rivalries in Chilean cultural history. They were peers, part of the same generation, and were all at some point in their lives members of the Chilean Communist Party. De Rokha would later be expelled from the party for some disagreement with the leaders, as they claim today.\n\nMistral expressed no political affiliation in Chile, although according to the Chilean writer Jaime Quezada, an expert on the work of Mistral, she expressed her Pan-Americanist will in her work \"Tala\", and expressed solidarity with the Nicaraguan revolutionary Augusto Sandino in two texts published in 1928.\n\nThe other three poets' links with the Communist party was a reflection of the political climate at the time and their desire to fight for the social change in Chile. However, personal disputes played a more important role than politics in their relationship. Pablo de Rokha became one of Neruda's bitterest enemies, considering him bourgeois and a hypocritical opportunist in political and social life. De Rokha wrote several essays and pamphlets in which he railed against Neruda, for example the poem \"Tercetos Dantescos\":\n\nHuidobro joined the communist party earlier than Neruda, and was extremely politically active for much of his life. Towards the end of his life, however, he left the political sphere and retired to his house in Cartagena on the coast of Chile. Huidobro also accused Neruda of plagiarising Rabindranath Tagore and in November 1934, the second edition of \"PRO\" magazine published without comment two poems discovered by Huidobro's friend Volodia Teitelboim: Tagore's \"Poem 30\" from \"The Gardener\" and Neruda's very similar \"Poem 16\" from \"20 Poems of Love\". Huidobro is also known to have referred to Neruda as a \"Romantic Poet\" who wrote poems for 15-year-old girls.\n\nNeruda reacted his peers' criticism by writing a text called \"Aquí estoy\" (Here I am), published in Paris in 1938, where he denounced their animosity and vilification. Despite this criticism, Neruda is recognized as one of the twenty six authors that make up the of literature, along with Shakespeare, Dante, Chaucer, Cervantes, Michel de Montaigne, Molière, Milton, Samuel Johnson, Goethe, Wordsworth, Jane Austen, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Tolstoy, Ibsen, Freud, Proust, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka, Borges, Neruda, Fernando Pessoa, Samuel Beckett.\n\nNeruda could put an end to the conflict once de Rokha and Huidobro were dead, instead in his speech at the Nobel Prize ceremony he says referring to Huidobro: \"El poeta no es un pequeño Dios\" (The poet, is not a little god).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33955359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33955359", "title": "Classical tradition", "text": "Classical tradition\n\nThe Western classical tradition is the reception of classical Greco-Roman antiquity by later cultures, especially the post-classical West, involving texts, imagery, objects, ideas, institutions, monuments, architecture, cultural artifacts, rituals, practices, and sayings. Philosophy, political thought, and mythology are three major examples of how classical culture survives and continues to have influence. The West is one of a number of world cultures regarded as having a classical tradition, including the Indian, Chinese, Judaic, and Islamic traditions.\n\nThe study of the classical tradition differs from classical philology, which seeks to recover \"the meanings that ancient texts had in their original contexts.\" It examines both later efforts to uncover the realities of the Greco-Roman world and \"creative misunderstandings\" that reinterpret ancient values, ideas and aesthetic models for contemporary use. The classicist and translator Charles Martindale has defined the reception of classical antiquity as \"a two-way process … in which the present and the past are in dialogue with each other.\"\n\nThe beginning of a self-conscious classical tradition is usually located in the Renaissance, with the work of Petrarch in 14th-century Italy. Although Petrarch believed that he was recovering an unobstructed view of a classical past that had been obscured for centuries, the classical tradition in fact had continued uninterrupted during the Middle Ages. There was no single moment of rupture when the inhabitants of what was formerly the Roman Empire went to bed in antiquity and awoke in the medieval world; rather, the cultural transformation occurred over centuries. The use and meaning of the classical tradition may seem, however, to change dramatically with the emergence of humanism.\nThe phrase \"classical tradition\" is itself a modern label, articulated most notably in the post-World War II era with \"The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature\" of Gilbert Highet (1949) and \"The Classical Heritage and Its Beneficiaries\" of R. R. Bolgar (1954). The English word \"tradition,\" and with it the concept of \"handing down\" classical culture, derives from the Latin verb \"trado, tradere, traditus\", in the sense of \"hand over, hand down.\"\n\nWriters and artists influenced by the classical tradition may name their ancient models, or allude to their works. Often scholars infer classical influence through comparative methods that reveal patterns of thought. Sometimes authors' copies of Greek and Latin texts will contain handwritten annotations that offer direct evidence of how they read and understood their classical models; for instance, in the late 20th century the discovery of Montaigne's copy of Lucretius enabled scholars to document an influence that had long been recognized.\n\n"}

Many restaurants are open late and most of the bars stay open until dawn. It contains offices, accommodation, tourist shopping, entertainment, food, art and buskers offering many genres of free performance. Pedestrian traffic is substantial around the clock.\n\nThe first building of any importance in Courtenay Place was built shortly after 1900 by local butcher and businessman, John Rod JP. It is now a heritage listed building, originally designed by T S Lambert, situated on the eastern corner of Allen Street and Courtenay Place. Of brick construction, it originally had three stories and a large cellar, with stables at the rear (now 23 Allen street). It has since been reduced to two stories, probably due to earthquake damage. In 2015, the ground floor and cellars accommodate a bar and restaurant.\n\nEvery two years Courtenay Place is home to many of the New Zealand International Arts Festival events.\n\nBats Theatre is a venue for the development of new theatre practitioners and plays.\n\nDownstage Theatre, founded in 1964, is New Zealand's first professional theatre.\n\nEmbassy Theatre \"The Lord of the Rings\" movie \"\" had its world premiere at the Embassy Theatre at the head of Courtenay Place. The movies \"\" and \"\" both had their Australasian premiere at the Embassy (Event Slide Shows). Both events were broadcast live to the world for many hours, involving the movement of record amounts of data by CityLink. The theatre is on the Wellington City Council's heritage list in the District Plan. Heritage New Zealand has recognised its heritage values with Category One registration, indicating a place of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'. It was originally known as the 'De Luxe' and was built in 1924. Designed by Llewellyn Williams and constructed of reinforced concrete, it included classical external and internal architectural details. The name changed to the Embassy in 1945. A long list of theatre identities has been associated with the theatre, including William Kemball, who formed the De Luxe Theatre Company in 1923, and Sir Robert Kerridge. Kerry Robins, leaseholder of the Paramount Theatre in Wellington, took over the lease of the Embassy in 1996. It was purchased by the Embassy Theatre Trust in 1997 with financial underwriting of the refurbishment programme by Wellington City Council. Ownership was transferred to the WCC under the terms of the agreement. Embassy Theatre Trust subsidiary Company Financial report: Audit report In October 2005 Wellington film exhibitor Kerry Robins sold the operational management of the Embassy to Village SkyCity Cinemas.\n\nParamount Theatre (no longer operational) is the oldest surviving cinema in Wellington, still with its original name. Originally a part of Te Aro beach, in August 1916 the location of the Paramount was purchased by John James Williamson. He arranged for architect James Bennie to design a picture house.\n\nReading Courtenay Central Complex contains shops, restaurants and a ten-screen multiplex cinema. The 8,000 m² development links Courtenay Place with the waterfront and was designed to complement the existing character of the strip. This project won the 2003 Property Council NZ Entertainment Excellence Award. The site was originally bulldozed in the mid-1980s by Chase Corporation for the proposed Wakefield Centre, but after the company fell victim to the 1987 sharemarket crash, the site remained derelict for years until it was purchased by Reading Cinemas. The complex was temporarily shut down for safety reasons, after a large earthquake in late 2016 damaged an adjacent parking building beyond repair.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision (aka NZ Film Archive) is on the corner of Ghuznee St and Taranaki St, a block from Courtenay Place.\n\nThe Opera House\n\nSt James Theatre.

It was the first steel-framed concrete-coated proscenium-arched theatre in the Southern Hemisphere. The steel frame allowed for an unsupported 80 ft (25 m) span roof structure and also provided good resistance to earthquake damage.\n\nIn July 2011, Positively Wellington Venues, an integration between the Wellington Convention Centre and the St James Theatre Trust, began managing this theatre as well as The Opera House, Wellington.\n\nThere are two other theatres that sit just outside the Courtenay Place district, Circa Theatre which sits on the waterfront near Te Papa; and Capital E, home of the National Theatre for Children, which is in Civic Square.\n\nIn 2017, TEDxWellington hosted 13 speakers and 1,000 delegates at the St. James Theatre on Courtenay Place.\n\n"}

His work is principally semi-abstract Scottish landscapes which are created based upon his experience as a hill walker. Even though he is registered blind Salmon has climbed more than one hundred of Scotland's Munros, many of which have been captured in his artworks.\n\nKeith Salmon was born in Essex and moved to Wales in the late 1960s. He studied for his BA in art at what is now Shrewsbury College of Arts & Technology and Falmouth School of Art between 1979 and 1983. He originally trained and worked as a sculptor, constructing pieces from steel, wood and cement fondu. On completion of his studies he moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the north east of England where he set up his first studio.\n\nIn 1989, Salmon moved back to Wales and set up a new studio. Around this time his sight deteriorated very quickly and within a few years he had to stop exhibiting work. He then decided to make the most of the time he still had sight and put his efforts into drawing and painting, finding new methods using just the very limited sight he now had left.\n\nIn 1998, he moved to Irvine, Ayrshire, in Scotland and, though registered blind, had enough confidence in the new paintings and drawings he created to once again start exhibiting them.\n\nDuring this time his work has developed in two different styles: organised scribbles that form his drawings, and the bolder, broad marks in oil or acrylic paintings. Most of his works are based on his experiences while out walking in the Scottish Highlands. Over the last few years he has combined the scribbled pastel line with the painted acrylic marks, stating that he is \"trying to capture a little of how I experience these wonderful wild places\".\n\nAt present Salmon keeps a studio space at Courtyard Studios in Irvine and is regularly exhibiting his work again.\n\nIn 2009, Salmon won the Jolomo Award for Scottish landscape painting and was interviewed by \"The Scotsman\", one of Scotland's top broadsheet newspapers.\n\n2009\n\n2008\n\n2009\n2006\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42010886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42010886", "title": "Legend of the Leather Bridge", "text": "Legend of the Leather Bridge\n\nThere is a legend of the Leather Bridge () in several regions of Germany and Switzerland. The word \"lederne\" could also have meant \"ladder\" or \"lantern\".\n\nAccording to legend, there was once a leather bridge crossing the Elmstein valley between the Palatine castle of Erfenstein, high above the left bank of the Speyerbach river, and a second castle, Spangenberg, on the opposite side of the valley. Two brothers, or at least two close friends, who visited each other frequently, decided to build the bridge in order to avoid having to take the difficult path through the valley between the two castles and over the then wild River Speyerbach.\n\nTheir friendship continued for many years. But one day the two lords, having feasted together at the Spangenberg again, began a heated argument. No doubt, an excess of wine had contributed to the situation. One word led to another and finally the Erfenstein lord, beside himself with rage, returned over the bridge, having shouted loudly, \"I will never come back!\" Equally furious, the lord of Spangenberg roared after him, \"You don't need to; I'll see to that!\" And when the lord of Erfenstein reached the middle of the bridge, Spangenberg cut the leather straps with his sword. The bridge fell into the depths and the lord of Erfenstein plunged to his death. One source records that the dispute was because one lord, who was a bachelor and the golden-haired wife of his brother had fallen in love and the bridge was used for their trysts.\n\nEver after this murder there was bitter enmity between the owners of the two castles and they damaged one another whenever they could.\n\nThe historic background to the legend is that the two castles were always owned by different overlords – initially Spangenberg to the Speyer prince-bishop and Erfenstein to the counts of Leiningen – who in were always in competition with one another. When, later, their ownership changed, a conflict broke out, the Weißenburg Feud, between Elector Frederick I of the Palatinate and his cousin, Duke Louis I of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. As a result both castles were destroyed in 1470; first, Erfenstein, and then, Spangenberg. \n\nTechnically, to make a bridge made of soft, sagging material such as leather would not have been practicable because the height of the castles above the floor of the valley (about one hundred metres) would not be enough to span the five hundred metres between them.\n\nA leather bridge is supposed to have linked the two castles of Stolzenburg and Pielstein over the Urft. According to local legend, their knights lived in the lap of luxury, demanding socage from the farmers, yet allowing their children to play skittles along the bridge with loaves of bread, whilst the subjects were dying of hunger. God himself is said to have destroyed both castles by unleashing a natural disaster.\n\nNear Arnsberg legend has it that the devil made a leather bridge between the castles of Rüdenburg and Arnsberg in order to provide an escape route for the beleaguered lord of Rüdenburg and his men. This was done in gratitude for the hospitality that the Rüdenburgers had previously unwittingly shown the devil. \n\nIn the valley of Kartäusertal, on the southern edge of the Nördlinger Ries there was supposed to have been a leather bridge between the three sister castles of Rauhaus, Hochhaus and Niederhaus. According to legend, whoever \"cut the leather bridge\" would have his castle swallowed up by the earth.\n\nIt is assumed that the \"lederne Brücke\" in this story, actually means a \"bridge of lights\", in other words that there was a communication link between the castles that was maintained using light signals. When, one day, Rauhaus Castle became unoccupied, the light bridge was interrupted. The castle was then plundered by the local populace and slighted; it was thus practically \"swallowed by the earth\".\n\nIn Mellingen on the River Ilm southeast of Weimar there were once two castles: one on the Kapellenberg hill and the Heinrichsburg, both of which were probably destroyed during the Saxon Fratricidal War. Both castles, separated by about 1.5 kilometres, were supposed to have been connected by a leather bridge. Especially in the older literature (around 1900) it is posited that this legend is a mythological reference to Edda.\n\nNear Elsterberg on the White Elster are the ruins of Elsterberg Castle. A leather bridge is supposed to have joined the old castle over a distance of several hundred metres to the newer buildings.\n\nAn evil Wendish prince, or according to other Sorbian legends a Wendish king called \"Prebislav\" in the 10th century, is supposed to have lived in a castle in the \"Teufelslauch\" northeast of Friedland in the direction of the village of \"Reudnitz\". In order to pursue his crimes as a robber knight, he left the castle over a leather bridge that he rolled out in front of him and rolled up behind him. When he robbed a man who was in league with the devil, the devil whipped up a mighty thunderstorm. A lightning bolt killed the prince and the floods caused the castle to sink into the ground. All that remains are the water-filled depressions of the \"Teufelslauch\" (\"Devil's Hole\").\n\nIn Wileroltigen a tale is told of tunnels, a leather bridge and a stone grave. The castle of Oltigen and the castle of Wileroltigen were first mentioned in 1006. Along with Hugo of Mümpelgard (Montbéliard), Count of Oltigen they came to an evil end in May 1410, according to Conrad Justinger.\n"}

It premiered on October 2, 2013, on MTV, shortly before the release of her record, for which the documentary served as a promotional tool. The documentary depicts Cyrus finalizing details regarding its launch, making public appearances for additional promotion, and rehearsing for her controversial performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n\"Miley: The Movement\" received generally mixed reviews from mainstream critics, who appreciated Cyrus' seemingly genuine commentary, but were disappointed by its failure to fully discuss her recent controversies and public criticisms. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by approximately 1.6 million viewers in the United States. An extended version of the documentary was broadcast by MTV on October 6, 2013.\n\nIt was first announced that Cyrus would appear in a documentary broadcast by MTV in July 2013; an official statement published by the network elaborated that it would \"[follow] Cyrus as she works on the album and delves deep into the transformation she has experienced over the past few years.\" Its title was announced on September 10, with a broadcast date confirmed for October 2. It premiered shortly before the release of Cyrus' fourth studio album \"Bangerz\", for which the documentary served as a promotional tool. An official trailer was released by MTV on September 18. \"Miley: The Movement\" was screened to mainstream critics the week prior to its official release, although it was further reworked before being broadcast on the network.\n\n\"Miley: The Movement\" commences with Cyrus stating \"I don't apologize for anything.\" Shortly after, she comments that \"For me, the movement needs to be something bigger than just a record. For me, a movement is something that represents, like, taking over the world.\" Cyrus notably avoids specifically naming her former television series \"Hannah Montana\", instead calling it \"my show\" when flashback pictures of her earlier career was shown, presumably to distance herself from the franchise. However, she commented that after its conclusion \"I made one movie, and I never wanted to do it again. I want to make music for the rest of my life.\" Having been filmed after \"Bangerz\" was recorded, the documentary instead depicts Cyrus finalizing details including its album artwork and track listing. A brief discussion in a recording studio with Britney Spears, who is featured on the track \"SMS (Bangerz)\" is additionally included.\n\nCyrus' former fiancé Liam Hemsworth, whom she had been in a highly publicized relationship with before ending her engagement in September 2013, and father Billy Ray Cyrus are not mentioned during the program in an intentional effort to \"focus on music and professional footage.\" Cyrus' mother Tish frequently appears during \"Miley: The Movement\", and on one occasion describes her initial hesitation after Cyrus befriended hip hop producers and recording artists Juicy J, Pharrell Williams, and Mike Will Made It. Cyrus is seen making promotional appearances for further promotion of \"Bangerz\" in the three months before its release. The preparation for her controversial performance of \"We Can't Stop\" at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards serves as a recurring theme; she expresses concern that the track itself charted lower than Cyrus expected on the iTunes Store immediately after its release, experiences a brief illness during rehearsals, and becomes upset after her planned entrance to the event did not come to fruition. The final performance itself is not shown, although Cyrus briefly addresses criticism and describes it as \"a strategic hot mess.\"\n\n\"Miley: The Movement\" received generally mixed reviews from mainstream critics. Writing for E!, Bruna Nessif provided a favorable review; she opined that the documentary was \"pretty entertaining\" and reminded the general public that Cyrus \"takes her job very seriously and still gets nervous.\" Andrew Asare from \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt that Cyrus' footage with her mother and Spears were among \"her most candid moments\", although noted the absences of her father and Hemsworth. \"Newsday\"s Glenn Gamboa gave a positive review, appreciating that Cyrus \"surprises with her words, not her twerks.\" Elysa Gardner of \"USA Today\" opined that Cyrus appeared \"good-humored and grateful to her fans\" throughout the documentary, but questioned if her evolving image and public persona would become \"yet another cautionary tale.\"\n\nIn a mixed review, Kia Makarechi from \"The Huffington Post\" was critical of the decision to avoid mentioning Hemsworth and toning-down of the criticism Cyrus received after the MTV Video Music Awards. She implied that MTV treated Cyrus like \"an honest-to-god civil rights advocate\", although felt that Spears' appearance was among the only \"redeeming moments\" of the documentary. Kate Dries from Jezebel suggested that frequent flashback footage of Cyrus' idols Madonna and Spears implied that MTV was \"clearly proud\" that all three women generated controversies at the MTV Video Music Awards in years past. Writing for Refinery29, Leila Brillson felt that \"very little was clarified\" by \"Miley: The Movement\", and suggested that the documentary suffered from a lack of focus.\n\nIn its original broadcast in the United States on October 2, 2013, \"Miley: The Movement\" was watched by approximately 1.6 million viewers, and earned a 0.8 rating in the 18–49 demographic. An expanded version of the program with an additional thirty minutes of content was broadcast by MTV on October 6, 2013; it contained behind-the-scenes footage that was excluded from the original version, and expanded upon existing segments.\n\n"}
{"id": "3085510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3085510", "title": "Minhwa", "text": "Minhwa\n\nMinhwa refers to Korean folk art produced mostly by itinerant or unknown artists without formal training, emulating contemporary trends in fine art for the purpose of everyday use or decoration. The term \"minhwa\" was coined by Yanagi Muneyoshi.\n\nLiterally \"painting of the people\" or \"popular painting\". This type of painting was often the work of anonymous craftsmen who faithfully adhered to the styles, canons and genres inherited from the past. Minhwa also involved a magical dimension. They were believed to possess beneficial virtues and to protect the owner and his family from evil forces. They feature popular themes such as cranes, rocks, water, clouds, the sun, moon, pine-trees, tortoises, insects and flowers.\n\n\"Minhwa\" art developed into its present form in the seventeenth century. The artists were common people who went from place to place, often following festivals, where they would paint for the locals, fulfilling their commissions on the spot. Important stages in life were also marked by the painting of a minhwa picture. Both common people and nobles would commission these artists.\n\nThe paintings worked on a number of levels. They show figures from folk mythology and legends, symbols of happiness, wealth and health, and scenes of everyday life. The most common figures were animals that represented power, such as the tiger, or providential circumstances, such as carp, which represent success. The paintings were done on paper and on canvas. \n\nAfter a decline during the colonial rule, the art form experienced a short boom until laid low by the Korean War. In the 1980s, though, there was a revival of Minhwa, the interest and popularity of which persists to this day.\n\n\"Kkachi horangi\" () is a prominent genre of \"minhwa\" that depicts magpies and tigers. In \"kkachi horangi\" paintings, the tiger, which is intentionally given a ridiculous and stupid appearance (hence its nickname \"idiot tiger\" 바보호랑이), represents authority and the aristocratic yangban, while the dignified magpie represents the common man. Hence, \"kkachi horangi\" paintings of magpies and tigers were a satire of the hierarchical structure of Joseon's feudal society.\n\n\"Munjado\" (), also known as \"flower writing\" (), is a genre of \"minhwa\" that enjoyed popularity in the 18th and 19th centuries, in which large Chinese characters associated with Confucian philosophy are painted as a representation of their meaning, with depictions of related stories and themes painted into the characters themselves.\n\n\"Chaekgeori\" is a genre of still-life painting that features books as the dominant subject. Originally a court art embraced by the upper class, \"chaekgeori\" spread to the \"minhwa\" folk art of the common class in the 19th century, resulting in more expressionist and abstract depictions, and the diminished prominence of bookshelves as a primary motif.\n\n"}

While she was visiting the city cemetery, she met a Polish woman who gave her a sealed envelope saying \"My son has asked me to give this to you. I don't know anything about it\" and left. In the envelope Heilbrunn found a notebook with handwriting she recognized as belonging to her former student, Miriam Chaszczewacki. Heilbrunn brought the notebook to Israel and published its content.\n\nOriginally the diary was written in Polish. Parts of the diary were published in Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish, English and German. The original notebook was donated to Yad Vashem.\n\nMiriam's mother Sarah Lavit Zelber, born to a Hassidic family was a kindergarten teacher and a public figure. Miriam's father David was born in Ukraine. He opened a Jewish school in Radomsko where he taught Hebrew. This school was later active in the ghetto. Miriam's brother Nahum was born in 1929. Miriam was a 15-year-old gymnasium student and a member of a Zionist youth movement when the war began. She is described as a gentle, sensitive, intelligent and talented girl who studied Hebrew in her father's school. In another testimony, she is described as a shy, romantic and dreamy teenager.\n\nMiriam's father and brother were murdered in the ghetto by the Germans. The father, David, was killed for refusing to board a deportation train. The brother Nahum was buried in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery.\n\nThe diary begins with the introductory chapter that describes the events between the summer of 1939 and the occupation of Radomsko by the Germans in September 1939. The second part of the diary consists of 27 dated entries starting at 21 April 1941 describing the events of the war and ghetto life along with the typical account of a teenage girl's emotions.\n\nThe last entry in the diary in Miriam's handwriting was on 7 October 1942, when Miriam was 18. Between 9 and 12 October 1942 about 14,000 residents of the ghetto were sent to Treblinka.\n\nIn the last page of the notebook appears an entry in a different, adult, handwriting, possibly by the Polish policeman who was the son of the woman who passed the notebook to Stefania Heilbrunn:\n\nOn the evening of the 24 October 1942 she surrendered, together with her mother, to a Polish policeman on duty on Limanewskeigo Str. They asked to be taken to the Judenrat, as they have been hiding for a week in a lavatory and had enough of it all. During the last 3 days they ate raw groats. They were taken to the Police station and the next day left with a transport by lorry to Częstochowa.\n\nIn one of the diary's last entries, about a month before her death, Miriam wrote:\n\nIt may seem silly, but only a step away from death I still worry about my diary. I would not want for it to meet a miserable end in an oven or on a rubbish heap. I wish somebody could find it – even if it be only a German – and would read it. I wish that these scribblings, though they record barely a fraction of the cruelties, would one day serve as a true and faithful document of our times.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "282752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=282752", "title": "National Endowment for the Arts", "text": "National Endowment for the Arts\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) is an independent agency of the United States federal government that offers support and funding for projects exhibiting artistic excellence. It was created by an act of the U.S. Congress in 1965 as an independent agency of the federal government. The NEA has its offices in Washington, D.C. It was awarded Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre in 1995, as well as the Special Tony Award in 2016.\n\nThe NEA is \"dedicated to supporting excellence in the arts, both new and established; bringing the arts to all Americans; and providing leadership in arts education\".\n\nBetween 1965 and 2008, the agency has made in excess of 128,000 grants, totaling more than $5 billion. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, Congress granted the NEA an annual funding of between $160 and $180 million. In 1996, Congress cut the NEA funding to $99.5 million as a result of pressure from conservative groups, including the American Family Association, who criticized the agency for using tax dollars to fund highly controversial artists such as Barbara DeGenevieve, Andres Serrano, Robert Mapplethorpe, and the performance artists known as the \"NEA Four\". Since 1996, the NEA has partially rebounded with a 2015 budget of $146.21 million. For FY 2010, the budget reached the level it was at during the mid-1990s at $167.5 million but fell again in FY 2011 with a budget of $154 million.\n\nThe NEA is governed by a Chairman appointed by the President to a four-year term and confirmed by Congress. The NEA's advisory committee, the National Council on the Arts, advises the Chairman on policies and programs, as well as reviewing grant applications, fundraising guidelines, and leadership initiative. This body consists of 14 individuals appointed by the President for their expertise and knowledge in the arts, in addition to six \"ex officio\" members of Congress who serve in a non-voting capacity. On June 12, 2014, Dr. Jane Chu was confirmed as the 11th Chair of the NEA by the Senate, after having been nominated by President Barack Obama in February of the same year.\n\nThe NEA offers grants in the categories of: 1) Grants for Arts Projects, 2) National Initiatives, and 3) Partnership Agreements. Grants for Arts Projects support exemplary projects in the discipline categories of artist communities, arts education, dance, design, folk and traditional arts, literature, local arts agencies, media arts, museums, music, musical theater, opera, presenting (including multidisciplinary art forms), theater, and visual arts.\nThe NEA also grants individual fellowships in literature to creative writers and translators of exceptional talent in the areas of prose and poetry.\n\nThe NEA has partnerships in the areas of state and regional, federal, international activities, and design. The state arts agencies and regional arts organizations are the NEA's primary partners in serving the American people through the arts. Forty percent of all NEA funding goes to the state arts agencies and regional arts organizations. Additionally, the NEA awards three Lifetime Honors: NEA National Heritage Fellowships to master folk and traditional artists, NEA Jazz Masters Fellowships to jazz musicians and advocates, and NEA Opera Honors to individuals who have made extraordinary contributions to opera in the United States. The NEA also manages the National Medal of Arts, awarded annually by the President.\n\nArtist William Powhida has noted that \"in one single auction, wealthy collectors bought almost a billion dollars in contemporary art at Christie's in New York.\" He further commented: \"If you had a 2 percent tax just on the auctions in New York you could probably double the NEA budget in two nights.\"\n\nThe NEA is the federal agency responsible for recognizing outstanding achievement in the arts. It does this by awarding three lifetime achievement awards. The NEA Jazz Masters Fellowships is awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to the art of jazz. The NEA National Heritage Fellowships is awarded for artistic excellence and accomplishments for American's folk and traditional arts. The National Medal of Arts is awarded by the President of the United States and NEA for outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support, and availability of the arts in the United States.\n\nUpon entering office in 1981, the incoming Ronald Reagan administration intended to push Congress to abolish the NEA completely over a three-year period. Reagan's first director of the Office of Management and Budget, David A. Stockman, thought the NEA and the National Endowment for the Humanities were \"good [departments] to simply bring to a halt because they went too far, and they would be easy to defeat.\" Another proposal would have halved the arts endowment budget. However, these plans were abandoned when the President's special task force on the arts and humanities, which included close Reagan allies such as conservatives Charlton Heston and Joseph Coors, discovered \"the needs involved and benefits of past assistance,\" concluding that continued federal support was important. Frank Hodsoll became the chairman of the NEA in 1981, and while the department's budget decreased from $158.8 million in 1981 to $143.5 million, by 1989 it was $169.1 million, the highest it had ever been.\n\nIn 1989, Donald Wildmon of the American Family Association held a press conference attacking what he called \"anti-Christian bigotry,\" in an exhibition by photographer Andres Serrano. The work at the center of the controversy was \"Piss Christ\", a photo of a plastic crucifix submerged in a vial of an amber fluid described by the artist as his own urine. Republican Senators Jesse Helms and Al D'Amato began to rally against the NEA, and expanded the attack to include other artists. Prominent conservative Christian figures including Pat Robertson of the 700 Club and Pat Buchanan joined the attacks. Republican representative Dick Armey, an opponent of federal arts funding, began to attack a planned exhibition of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe at the Corcoran Museum of Art that was to receive NEA support.\n\nOn June 12, 1989, The Corcoran cancelled the Mapplethorpe exhibition, saying that it did not want to \"adversely affect the NEA's congressional appropriations.\" The Washington Project for the Arts later hosted the Mapplethorpe show. The cancellation was highly criticized and in September, 1989, the Director of the Corcoran gallery, Christina Orr-Cahill, issued a formal statement of apology saying, \"The Corcoran Gallery of Art in attempting to defuse the NEA funding controversy by removing itself from the political spotlight, has instead found itself in the center of controversy. By withdrawing from the Mapplethorpe exhibition, we, the board of trustees and the director, have inadvertently offended many members of the arts community which we deeply regret. Our course in the future will be to support art, artists and freedom of expression.\"\n\nThough this controversy inspired congressional debate about appropriations to the NEA, including proposed restrictions on the content of NEA-supported work and their grantmaking guidelines, efforts to defund the NEA failed.\n\nConservative media continued to attack individual artists whose NEA-supported work was deemed controversial. The \"NEA Four\", Karen Finley, Tim Miller, John Fleck, and Holly Hughes, were performance artists whose proposed grants from the United States government's National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) were vetoed by John Frohnmayer in June 1990. Grants were overtly vetoed on the basis of subject matter after the artists had successfully passed through a peer review process. The artists won their case in court in 1993 and were awarded amounts equal to the grant money in question, though the case would make its way to the United States Supreme Court in \"National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley\". The case centered on subsection (d)(1) of which provides that the NEA Chairperson shall ensure that artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria by which applications are judged. The court ruled in , that Section 954(d)(1) is facially valid, as it neither inherently interferes with First Amendment rights nor violates constitutional vagueness principles.\n\nThe 1994 midterm elections cleared the way for House Speaker Newt Gingrich to lead a renewed attack on the NEA. Gingrich had called for the NEA to be eliminated completely along with the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. While some in Congress attacked the funding of controversial artists, others argued the endowment was wasteful and elitist. However, despite massive budget cutbacks and the end of grants to individual artists, Gingrich ultimately failed in his push to eliminate the endowment.\n\nIn mid-2009, the NEA came under controversy again when it was revealed on a website run by conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart that then-Communications Director Yosi Sergant had participated in an August 10, 2009 conference call that allegedly directed artists to create works of art promoting President Barack Obama's domestic agenda. \"I would encourage you to pick something, whether it's health care, education, the environment, you know, there's four key areas that the corporation has identified as the areas of service,\" Sergant said on the call, making reference to the four areas of focus earlier outlined by Nell Abernathy, Director of Outreach for United We Serve. Suggested areas of focus mentioned in the call included preventative care, child nutrition, community cleanups, trail maintenance, reading tutoring, and homelessness. At another point he said, \"This is just the beginning. This is the first telephone call of a brand new conversation. We are just now learning how to really bring this community together to speak with the government. What that looks like legally. We're still trying to figure out the laws of putting government websites of Facebook and the use of Twitter. This is all being sorted out. We are participating in history as it's being made, so bear with us as we learn the language so that we can speak to each other safely. And we can really work together to move the needle to get stuff done.\"\n\nThe NEA countered the allegations by asserting that Sergant had acted unilaterally and without the approval of then-Acting Chairman Patrice Walker Powell, and that the call was not a means to promote any legislative agenda but rather to inform members of the arts community of an opportunity to become involved in volunteerism through the United We Serve program. They also noted that the call had nothing to do with grantmaking.\n\nThe budget outline submitted by President Trump on March 16, 2017, to Congress would eliminate all funding for the program. Congress approved a budget that retained NEA funding. The White House budget proposed for fiscal year 2018 again called for elimination of funding, but Congress retained the funding for another year.\n\n\n\nStatement from Jane Chu on the Conclusion of Her Term as NEA Chair on June 4, 2018\n\n\n"}

In a broader usage, the term has come to refer to any painting of a night scene, or night-piece, such as Rembrandt's \"The Night Watch\".\n\nWhistler used the term within the title of his works to represent paintings with a \"dreamy, pensive mood\" by applying a musical name. He also titled (and retitled) works using other terms associated with music, such as a \"symphony\", \"harmony\", \"study\" or \"arrangement\", to emphasize the tonal qualities and the composition and to de-emphasize the narrative content. The use of the term \"nocturne\" can be associated with the Tonalism movement of the American of the late 19th century and early 20th century which is \"characterized by soft, diffused light, muted tones and hazy outlined objects, all of which imbue the works with a strong sense of mood.\" Along with winter scenes, nocturnes were a common Tonalist theme.Frederic Remington used the term as well for his nocturne scenes of the American Old West.\n\nIn northern Europe, the Dutch Golden Age produced one of the greatest artists of all time. The first artist to paint scenes on a regular basis in the nocturne mode was Rembrandt van Rijn (1606–1669). Many of his portraits were also painted using a nocturne method. As in \"The Mill\" (1645), most of his landscapes were painted to evoke a sense of the nocturne, which could be expressed in either a calm or stormy manner.\n\n“Nocturne” was a term that was normally applied to certain types of musical compositions before James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834–1903), inspired by the language of music, began using the word within the titles of many of his works, such as \"Nocturne in Blue and Silver\" (1871), in the collection of the Tate Gallery, London, United Kingdom.\n\nFrederic Remington (1861-1909) is so identified for his nocturne scenes of the American Old West that they were celebrated in 2003-2004 with an exhibition, \"Frederic Remington: The Color of Night\", co-organized and shown in turn by the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., and the Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa, Oklahoma. The exhibition also generated a colorful book of the same title and travelled to the Denver Art Museum in Denver, Colorado. Remington painted many of his nocturnes in the last years of his life, when he was transitioning from a career as an illustrator to that of a fine artist and had chosen Impressionism as the style in which he worked at the time. One example of his work is \"The Stampede\" (also known as \"The Stampede by Lightning\", 1908).\nThe paintings pictured in the gallery below are in order of date completed, left to right:\n\n\nOther artists who also created nocturne scenes are:\n\n\n\n"}

With the widespread publication of Norse myths and legends at this time, references to the Norse gods and heroes spread into European literary culture, especially in Scandinavia, Germany, and Britain. In the later 20th century, references to Norse mythology became common in science fiction and fantasy literature, role-playing games, and eventually other cultural products such as Japanese animation.\n\nAntiquaries of the 19th century such as George Webbe Dasent brought the mythology of Scandinavia back to the popular notice of many people in Germany and England; in both cases, Norse mythology was recognized as the latest surviving form of Germanic paganism. Germany and England were Christianized far earlier than the Scandinavian countries and much of their own traditions were lost.\n\nIn Britain, William Morris composed poetry such as \"Sigurd the Volsung\" on Norse legendary subjects as well as translating Icelandic sagas into English. In Germany, Richard Wagner borrowed characters and themes from Norse mythology to compose the four operas that make up \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (\"The Ring of the Nibelung\"), though he also utilized medieval German sources and Germanized the names of the Norse gods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorse mythology influenced Richard Wagner's use of literary themes from it to compose the four operas that make up \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (\"The Ring of the Nibelung\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41976334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41976334", "title": "On Cinema", "text": "On Cinema\n\nOn Cinema (also called On Cinema at the Cinema for the video series) is an American comedic film review podcast and web series starring Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington. The duo appear as a pair of hapless movie reviewers (using their own names). The show started as an independently released podcast from 2011 to 2013, before being picked up as a professionally produced web video series by Thing X in 2012–13 for its first two seasons, and then moving to Adult Swim.com in 2013. It has aired 10 seasons, plus one special\nseason titled \"The Trial\". In addition, \"On Cinema\" spawned a spinoff web series in its fifth season, \"Decker,\" a simultaneous spoof of political-thrillers and homebrew video intended for the web. It later became a TV series, and as of 2018, it has aired 6 seasons of episodes total on Adultswim.com and Adult Swim.\n\nHeidecker and Turkington began making the podcast as a prank and a mockery of the \"self-indulgence\" of the podcasting community. Both Heidecker and Turkington have created an immersive universe through \"On Cinema\" and \"Decker.\" A live Oscar special is also done every year, streamed via YouTube, with interactive elements for fans, such as polling. Several seasons of \"On Cinema\" have discernible multi-episode plot arcs as Heidecker and Turkington explore the dynamic and characters they have created both in the series' episodes and, simultaneously, on social media, through Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.\n\nThe show has a dedicated cult following of fans who play along with the storylines via social media, often taking sides as \"GreggHeads\" or \"TimHeads\". Heidecker and Turkington also started \"Decker-Con\", where they appear in character and interact with fans.\n\nFor the Summer of 2018, Heidecker and Turkington initiated a nationwide \"On Cinema Live!\" tour with special guests from the On Cinema/Decker universe and special content.\n\nEarly audio episodes of \"On Cinema\" were quite short, frequently no more than one or two minutes long. Heidecker and Turkington would \"review\" films on these podcasts without actually providing any meaningful information or critical insight. Nearly every film that has been discussed or mentioned on \"On Cinema\" since the podcast's inception has received a \"5 bags of popcorn\" rating on a scale of five from the two reviewers, regardless of its reception elsewhere in the press or with the viewing public.\n\nWith the series' growth into an online video series, episodes grew to an average length of eight to twelve minutes. Although reviewing films remains a central conceit, the focus of the series quickly shifted from a mockery of amateur podcasting to an extended character study of the two podcasters. Heidecker, in character on \"On Cinema\", frequently uses his time on camera to discuss anything on his character's mind except film, especially his bizarre ailments, personal crises, and right-wing political views, or to simply berate and belittle Turkington. Turkington's character fancies himself a \"film expert,\" his primary qualification being an enormous collection of forgotten and arguably forgettable mainstream films from the 1980s and 1990s on VHS. The series continues to provide reviews that purposely offer no real critical insight. Recent seasons as of 2018 have seen Tim lose interest in reviewing and start a band first named \"Dekkar\" then \"DKR\" .\n\nGuest appearances have included Jordan Hoffman, Jimmy McNichol, Joe Estevez, Lawrence Turman, Sally Kellerman, Candy Clark, Mark Proksch, John Aprea, Peyton Reed, and Nicholas Meyer, some of whom also appear in the \"Decker\" series.\n\nThe \"On Cinema\" podcast was produced independently by Tim and Gregg. The podcast consists of Tim, along with Gregg as a \"special guest\" for every episode, covering movies poorly and with little insight, and often engaging in arguments. Gregg later developed a more pretentious \"film buff\" persona, and Tim took a turn to being obnoxiously political, sometimes devoting entire episodes to conspiracy theories, much to the chagrin of Gregg.\n\nAnother running joke that was carried over to the video series is Gregg's refusal to believe that \"\" is really \"Star Trek II,\" instead often believing stubbornly that \"\" is the real Star Trek II.\n\nStarting this season, the show is now in video format via Thing X.com, as well as having its name changed to \"On Cinema at the Cinema\". The series is similar to the podcast, but this time episodes always take place on a set meant to look like a movie theatre. Gregg is still never acknowledged as more than a guest each episode, and starts his weekly segments \"Popcorn Classics\" and \"On Cinema On Location\" where he brings in obscure, forgotten VHS movies to showcase and travels to filming locations of obscure movies, respectively. Tim begins using \"60 second soap box\" to talk about current political issues with a conservative narrative, much to the continued annoyance of Gregg. With the start of the web series, Tim uses a rating scale of \"bags of popcorn\" ranging from 0–5, and while Gregg uses five as a max, Tim often goes overboard giving scores of \"6 bags\" or even more, creating tension and confusion throughout the season. Most of the films reviewed get a score of at least \"5 bags\" from both reviewers.\n\nTim reveals he has blood clotting in his brain but does not want to get surgery because of \"side effects, the whole medical industry, and Obamacare\" while Gregg pushes for him to get surgery. In episode 208, Tim introduces the first special guest, Ayaka, a foreign exchange student from Japan staying with Tim's family.\n\nThe first Live On Cinema Oscar Special airs, where Tim and Gregg live stream during the Oscars and drink alcohol. Tim gets very drunk and throws up on some of Gregg's VHS tapes which causes Gregg to walk off the set.\n\nSeason 3 moved the series from Thing X to Adultswim.com. The season begins with Tim in a head bandage and clearly in physical pain as he went through with surgery for his blood clots. As a result of him going through the surgery, Tim's wife divorces him and this is the last time his family is referred to throughout the series. Gregg begins his goal of making the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" by becoming the first person in history to watch 500 movies in 500 days. Tim kicks Gregg off the show after Gregg drives all the way from Hollywood to San Francisco to make a video alleging the location of a \"Star Trek\" filming location, after he and Tim had disagreed on it before. John Aprea and Ayaka are guests on the next episode, where Tim reveals he is dating Ayaka and says he loves her for the first time. In the season finale, Gregg returns to the show as Ayaka was deported back to Japan.\n\nTim begins season four with many health problems and introduces his personal doctor, Dr. San (played by Zac Holtzman), an alternative medical doctor treating Tim with acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and other \"natural\" medicines. Dr. San begins coming onto the set with Tim, despite Gregg's objections. However, Tim's face becomes infected from the acupuncture and he denounces Dr. San.\n\nAyaka sends a letter to Tim on the show saying she is pregnant with Tim's child.\n\nThe second Live Oscar Special, Tim and Gregg drink (with Tim getting much drunker than Gregg). We are introduced to Mark Proksch who does impersonations of W.C. Fields and Charlie Chaplin.\n\nTim moves to Jackson Hole, Wyoming and buys a motorcycle to commute back and forth between there and Hollywood for the On Cinema taping.\n\nTim announces that Ayaka has had an abortion, despite remaining pro-life on the topic, saying \"when you are in that situation, choices have to be on the table.\" However, Gregg brings Ayaka onto On Cinema via Skype from Japan, revealing she did go through with the pregnancy and naming the boy Tom Cruise Heidecker Junior, after the actor Tom Cruise. Ayaka moves back to America with Tom Cruise Junior and into Gregg's apartment. This upsets Tim and he moves permanently to Jackson Hole. He makes Gregg host of the show and hands off all responsibilities to him in the season finale.\n\nGregg begins his first season as host, but after he is unable to find a guest, he records himself having conversations with himself and plays VHS video of his conversation during the episode.\n\nTim returns as host in episode 602 after he realized his new friends in Jackson Hole were white supremacists. He rekindles his relationship with Ayaka and moves into Gregg's apartment with her and Tom Cruise Junior. In the season finale, Tim proposes to Ayaka and she accepts.\n\nThe third Live Oscar Special airs, while Tim and Gregg get drunk and Tim, once again, gets much drunker than Gregg and becomes belligerent. Peyton Reed comes on the Special to promote his new film \"Ant-Man\" and announces that Gregg has been cast as a minor character in the movie, which upsets Tim. In the finale segment, Gregg introduces James Dean, the former actor who was believed to be dead since 1955. After reading on a message board about how Dean faked his own death and wrote a memoir called \"I'm Alive: How I Faked my own Death\" he brings Dean on set as his return to the public. Tim does not believe this is the real James Dean, leading to him verbally and physically threatening Dean before trashing the set.\n\nGregg moves to Victorville, California and opens the Victorville Film Archives in a storage locker, where he also lives.\n\nTim gives \"Ant-Man\" a rare one-bag of popcorn which upsets Gregg, leading to him accusing Tim of paying $15,000 to have a minor role in the new \"Fantastic Four\" movie, which Tim denies.\n\nAfter meeting a man at Guitar Center named Axiom, Tim starts a rock band named \"Dekkar\" with him. Their debut single Empty Bottle is released on the show, which upsets Gregg as it is not movie related and was played instead of his Popcorn Classic segment.\n\nGregg tells Tim that Dr. San, who Tim has been looking for since he infected Tim's face with dirty needles in acupuncture in season four, is Ayaka's boss at her job. Tim walks off the set angry that he had not realized this. However, the next episode is \"The Doctor San Forgiveness Special\" where both Tim and Dr. San forgive each other. Dr. San takes over as Tom Cruise Junior's new pediatric doctor.\n\nBy the season seven finale, Tim announces that Tom Cruise Junior has died. He plays a musical tribute to his son with Axiom and Dr. San.\n\nThe fourth Live Oscar Special is the biggest one yet, with periodic musical performances by Dekkar (much to the annoyance of Gregg), the \"Oscar Olympics\" featuring three games, officiated by Joe Estevez, and a DNA test by Dr. San of James Dean, which proves that he is in fact, James Dean. Tim hides the fact he has been drinking alcohol during the Special while no one else is, and he becomes angered by the DNA results. He proceeds to kick Dr. San off the set. An animated rendering of Tom Cruise Junior as a young adult comes on stage, in which Tim and the animated Tom Cruise Junior come out against vaccination.\n\nSeason eight moves the show to Victorville, where Tim has now moved into the storage unit with Gregg. They both buy an abandoned movie theater and open it as the \"Victorville Film Center\" where instead of playing new releases, a nightly showing from Gregg's VHS collection of Popcorn Classics is played. Attendance is minimal because of the obscurity of the films. Mark Proksch is hired as a concessions cashier.\n\nDr. San prescribes Tim a \"nutritional vape system\" in which Tim replaces all meals and food with an electronic cigarette full of supposed nutrients. However, Tim's physical condition worsens as the season progresses, as he comes to the set sweating, bruised, hallucinating, and unfocused. Despite this, he continues to use his nutritional vape system. After he cannot take the physical pain and symptoms of the vape system, Tim goes to an actual doctor who informs him the vape and his blood is full of Lsd, cocaine, and multiple other drugs – both legal and illegal. Tim quits the vape system and swears off Dr. San once again. Tim announces that Ayaka is pregnant with their second child. After Tim tries to get Ayaka to get an abortion, she leaves him and moves back to Japan. Tim begins a romantic relationship with Axiom's sister, Juliana.\n\nA fire is started in the storage unit after Tim's vape pen overheats one night, burning the entire facility down including the Victorville Film Archive. Tim suffers third degree burns on all of his body, including his face and hands. After insurance will not cover the cost of the fire, he returns to the show in bandages so he can keep working to pay for the damages and lawsuits, which exceed $1,000,000 according to Gregg.\n\nHowever, in Tim's return to On Cinema, he is surprised by an intervention by Gregg, Joe Estevez, John Aprea, Mark Proksch, Ayaka, Ayaka's father, and Axiom. They encourage Tim to live a healthier life, which upsets Tim. He yells and kicks everyone but Axiom out, and announces plans to start an electronic music version of Dekkar, now called \"DKR\".\n\nThe season finale ends with a remixed, electronic version of Empty Bottle and Tim announcing that Juliana is now pregnant with his child while Ayaka will go through with her pregnancy too.\n\nSeason nine begins with Gregg informing the audience that the Victorville Film Center has burnt down while he speculates Tim may have done it to collect insurance money.\n\nAfter Gregg and Tim move back to Hollywood, Tim opens up \"Six Bag Cinemas\", a new movie theater concept with recliner chairs and a waiter (who is Mark) that brings food to customers during the movie. Gregg constantly criticizes the theater and food.\n\nAfter Tim stops using the facial cream for the burns on his face, his skin dies and he needs a skin transplant. After a selection process in which Tim volunteers most of the potential donors himself, Manuel from DKR is chosen and donates skin off of his lower back and buttocks to Tim.\n\nTim and Dr. San are arrested and jailed on murder and manslaughter charges. At Tim's \"Electric Sun Desert Music Festival\" in Apple Valley, California, Dr. San allegedly gave out free samples of his nutritional vape system, the same one Tim uses, resulting in 20 deaths. Gregg takes over as host with Mark as his co-host, and the two spend an entire episode blaming Tim instead of reviewing movies.\n\nTim returns on bail, and finishes the last three episodes of the season with Turkington. Together with his lawyer, Doug Lyman, Tim has decided to pin the 20 deaths on Dr. San and the Apple Valley authorities who did not respond in time. In the season finale, it is revealed that Dr. San has committed suicide in jail, and that the relatives of the 20 who died are now primarily blaming Tim for the deaths. At the end of the final episode, Tim reveals to Gregg that he will never forget what Gregg said about him on the show, no matter what happens to him.\n\nA special event, titled \"The Trial\", began on November 15, 2017, streaming on Adult Swim's website with the trial of Tim Heidecker for the death of the \"Electric Sun 20\". Tim was found not guilty of the death of one of the 20, as that victim died of a heroin overdose. A mistrial was called for the remaining 19, due to a hung jury with 11 guilty and 1 not guilty verdicts. Gregg accused Tim of bribing the juror who voted not guilty.\n\nDirector and writer Nicholas Meyer appears as one of the testifiers in an ongoing joke alluding to a long-standing disagreement between Tim and Gregg as to whether or not San Francisco is the setting for the film \"Star Trek II.\" \n\nDuring the Fifth Oscar Special, Mark got locked tight into a standard diving dress while doing an impression of Richard Dreyfuss character in the Jaws movie and had to be hospitalized for asphyxiation.\n\nTim returns from the trial free from prison but facing a civil suit from one of the families of the Electric Sun 19. His assets, including On Cinema and Decker, are being seized and he claims he might soon be facing bankruptcy. After threatening to commit suicide and with help from his attorney (Mark Dwyer), Tim manages to convince the Delgado family to let him try to earn money for them with his various assets. The Delgado's and Tim's Attorney like the show after Episode 7, and hire Gregg as the managing editor of the newly incorporated Delgado Media Holding company, effectively giving him creative control on On Cinema.\n\nThe intro and production set have been upgraded, and the show now has a sponsor by name of Rio Jenesis, a protein shake company that creates a \"germ shield\", of which Tim is now consuming. Gregg begins writing letters to Tim Burton, questioning why he didn't work with Johnny Depp in \"Sherlock Gnomes\". He also announces that he has resurrected his film archives, which appears to be several bins full of VHS tapes (later revealed to be stocked in Mark Proksch hospital room) and is now collecting and wearing movie promotional hats to Tim's vocal displeasure. Episodes 4 through 6 were filmed in 360-degree video.\n\nAs of Episode 7, the show has returned to form with a stronger focus on movies than it had previously had in the last several seasons. However, this is in the context of Tim needing to turn the show around, with him openly discussing the possibility of suicide if it doesn't become more successful. The next three episodes, 8–10, saw Gregg's role on the show increasingly become that of the host, while Tim's role was diminished, allowing for more of Gregg's segments, including Popcorn Classics, to become larger segments in each episode. These changes coincided with Gregg's new role as the managing editor in On Cinema's parent company. In episode 10, the season finale, Tim threw a fit of rage and insulted the Delgados while announcing his wish to campaign for the post of district attorney of the San Bernardino County.\n\nHeidecker has stated that On Cinema was started out of a desire to mock the podcasting community. The first episode was recorded on set of \"The Comedy\", where Heidecker and Turkington were working together, after Heidecker proposed the idea between takes.\nIn April 2017, On Cinema initiated a Patreon page for funding, most of it going to the Oscar specials, with some of the higher options including receiving producer credits, walk-on roles for the Oscar specials, or live custom Skype reviews from Gregg Turkington.\n\nThe show has a dedicated cult following of fans who interact with the storylines via social media, often taking sides as \"GreggHeads\" or \"TimHeads\" in the frequent personal conflicts between the hosts which are often only tangentially, if at all, related to films or cinema. During the annual live Oscar special, Tim and Gregg both frequently provide interactive elements via online polls for fans to vote on. This cult following is especially found on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, the latter through Gregg and Tim's respective profiles, of which Gregg has completely devoted to the persona of his alter-ego. Heidecker and Turkington have also appeared in character on the podcasts \"Kreative Kontrol\" and \"Best Show\" in 2015 and 2017.\n\nHeidecker and Turkington also started \"Decker-Con\", where new episodes of \"Decker\" are shown to fans and the cast appears as their \"On Cinema\" characters to field questions.\n\nIn 2013 the \"On Cinema Film Guide\" app was released, featuring the voices of Turkington and Heidecker reviewing over 17,000 films.\n\nFor \"The Trial\", Heidecker and Turkington upended the traditional review aspect of the series, and staged an elaborate mock event where Tim's character was \"on trial for murder\" that lasted over a week. It received acclaim from observers, some of whom called it \"brilliant\" and \"ambitious.\"\n\nIn 2018, Heidecker and Turkington initiated a nationwide \"On Cinema Live!\" tour with special guests from the On Cinema/Decker universe such as Joe Estevez, the band \"Dekkar\" and special content created only for the tour, such as a live reviewing of all mid-2018 major release films: \"Superfly\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"Ant Man & The Wasp\".\n\n"}

In 1993, shortly after her graduation from Smith College, Kerman agreed to accompany Jansen on several trips to Asia and Europe, going as far as carrying a suitcase of laundered money across the Atlantic Ocean before returning to San Francisco to \"piece her life back together\". In May 1998, Kerman was visited by two Customs agents, and six years later she was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison. After serving time in three different facilities (FCI Danbury, FTC Oklahoma City, and MCC Chicago), Kerman was released in March 2005.\n\nSasha Abramsky of the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" stated that the book \"documents the author’s attempts to preserve her individuality in the face of a gray, impersonal bureaucracy—one prisoner counts, strip searches, rules governing the minutiae of life, and continual reminders that prisoners, by definition, have no power, no real autonomy.\" Abramsky wrote that the book is mostly \"a journey of self-discovery, describing how one can find one’s true strengths during moments of adversity\" and that it \"is more similar to South African anti-apartheid activist Albie Sachs's \"Jail Diary\" than it is to, say, Mumia Abu-Jamal’s denunciatory communiqués from Pennsylvania’s death row.\"\n\nIn her review for \"Slate\", Jessica Grose argued that the book is not an examination of women within prison but rather a member of the middle-class-transgression genre, in which women from higher level social classes go into situations which are considered degrading. She said that the book should have included Kerman's insight into her own behavior and \"A bit of this moral ambiguity would have helped Kerman's memoir a whole lot.\" June Thomas, also from \"Slate\", cited Grose's review and stated that, \"Ultimately, though, the book feels like a well-written, readable stage in Kerman’s rehabilitation.\" Thomas stated that the television show had improved on the book by expanding on Kerman's descriptions of real people and turning them into compelling fictional characters.\n\nWriting in the \"Journal-Advocate\", Tricia Ketchum called the book \"not your typical 'I survived prison memoir', referring to Kerman as \"spoiled\" as she received multiple care packages and money into her commissary. Ketchum concludes, \"The best part of this book is the message that it leaves you with: No matter what choices you make, you never realize just how much they will impact the lives of those around you until it is too late.\"\n\nThe book was selected by the UC Santa Barbara Library as its 2015 book for the university-wide reading program \"UCSB Reads\".\n\n"}

His experiences during that period have informed his writings, and as a result, in 1987 Butler received the Tu Do Chinh Kien Award from the Vietnam Veterans of America for outstanding contributions to American culture by a veteran. \"My greatest pleasure in life was at 2 in the morning to wander out into the steamy back alleys of Saigon, where nobody ever seemed to sleep, and just walk the alleys and crouch in the doorways with the people,\" Butler told \"The New York Times\" in 1993. \"The Vietnamese were the warmest, most open and welcoming people I've ever met, and they just invited me into their homes and into their culture and into their lives.\"\n\nAfter working as a steel mill laborer, a taxi driver, and a substitute teacher in high schools in the years following his tour of duty in Vietnam, Butler joined Fairchild Publications, where he worked on the staffs of trade publications such as \"Electronic News\". From 1975 until 1985, he was the editor-in-chief of Fairchild's \"Energy User News\" (now \"Energy & Power Management\").\n\nRobert Olen Butler is the author of 12 novels and six short story collections, including \"A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain\", which won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. In a review for the \"Guardian\" newspaper, renowned author Claire Messud wrote, \"The book has attracted such acclaim not simply because it is beautifully and powerfully written, but because it convincingly pulls off an immense imaginative risk. . . . Butler has not entered the significant and ever-growing canon of Vietnam-related fiction (he has long been a member)—he has changed its composition forever.\"\n\nButler began writing novels on the Long Island Railroad while working as a publicist for Fairchild Publications. \"Every word of my first four published novels was written on a legal pad, by hand, on my lap, on the Long Island Rail Road as I commuted back and forth from Sea Cliff to Manhattan,\" Butler has said about his early writing.\n\nThe author's first novel was \"The Alleys of Eden\", which was published in 1981 by Horizon Press after being rejected by 21 publishers. Its protagonist is an American deserter who decides to stay in Vietnam, as Butler's one-time writing professor Anatole Broyard wrote in \"The New York Times\", \"because, with all its troubles, Vietnam seems to him to retain more of its integrity, its sense of self, than the America he has left behind.\"\nPrior to the publication of \"The Alleys of Eden\", Butler had written, by his estimation, \"five ghastly novels, about forty dreadful short stories, and twelve truly awful full-length plays, all of which have never seen the light of day and never will.\"\n\nButler has always been a controversial artist, seemingly reinventing himself with each new novel or short story collection. His shape-shifting often polarizes reviewers, as was the case with Butler's second novel \"Sun Dogs\" (Horizon, 1983), which \"The New York Times\" described as having \"some powerful moments, some engrossing scenes and deft touches, but there is little momentum, no satisfying pattern, none of the magic of synergy.\" Conversely, the \"Ft. Worth Star-Telegram\" lauded the book as \"full of power and energy...mov[ing] from the most feverish of prose to a flatness and sparseness that is reminiscent of the best of Chandler and Hammett. And most importantly, he has something to say... Butler is an intelligent novelist who cares about his characters. He is skillful enough to make the reader feel the same way. It is not often that we get the chance to witness the birth of something this important.\"\n\nButler's stories have appeared in such publications as \"The New Yorker\", \"Esquire\", \"Harper's\", \"The Atlantic Monthly\", \"GQ\", and \"\". He has had stories included in a combined twelve editions of \"The Best American Short Stories\", \"New Stories From the South\", and numerous college literature textbooks. Butler has also written screenplays for film and television, most of them based on other writers' material.\n\nButler's short-story collections \"Tabloid Dreams\" (1996) and \"Had a Good Time\" (2004) take their inspiration from popular culture. The stories in \"Tabloid Dreams\" were spun from the titles of outlandish articles in supermarket tabloids. \"Had a Good Time\" builds its narratives around the images on vintage American picture postcards, which Butler has collected for more than a decade. One example is the tale \"Mother in the Trenches\", first published in \"Harper's\" in February 2003. It traces the journey of Mrs. Jack Gaines, a prosperous matron, from her comfortable home to the battlefields of World War I France, in order to convince her soldier son to come home; the story's basis is a period postcard that depicts a stout, middle-aged woman wearing dark clothes and a cloche hat.\n\nAgain the critical response varied dramatically. While the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said that the stories \"feel like a literary parlor game,\" \"The Boston Globe\" raved that it was full of \"crisp writing, marvelous imagining, the discussion of large, existential questions that are as central to life now as they were a hundred years ago.\"\n\n\"Severance,\" his 2006 collection of 240-word short stories about the post-beheading thoughts of decapitated individuals (from Nicole Brown Simpson to Louis XVI to the author himself) was the basis of \"Severance\", a one-act play by David Jette. It was produced in 2007 at McCadden Place Theatre in Los Angeles. At the time, Butler described \"Severance\" as his best and most ambitious book.\n\nThis was the first of an extended venture into defining and exploring the short short story form. His companion collection, \"Intercourse\", comprising 100 very short stories, revealed the inner monologues of couples (often famous) engaged in sexual intercourse. \"Weegee Stories,\" presenting the inner monologues of the subjects of 60 iconic photographs of Arthur \"Weegee\" Fellig, continued his interest in the form. He also published a theory of the short short story in \"Narrative Magazine\".\n\nAs further evidence of his predilection for self-reinvention, in 2009 he published \"Hell\", a \"roaring satire\" of a novel set entirely in the underworld. His 2011 novel, \"A Small Hotel\", is described by Donna Seaman of \"Booklist\", the American Library Association's magazine, as a \"sexy novel of psychological suspense.\" She goes on to say, \"Butler executes a plot twist of profound proportions in this gorgeously controlled, unnerving, and beautifully revealing tale of the consequences of emotional withholding.\"\n\nIn still another act of reinvention, Butler publishes his first literary/historical/espionage/thriller, \"The Hot Country\", with Otto Penzler's \"Mysterious Press\" in the fall of 2012.\n\nIn 2001, Butler wrote in real-time, a complete short story, \"This is Earl Sandt,\" from first inspiration to final story, in a webcast of 17 two-hour sessions. As the author explained of the broadcasts, \"What we're trying to do here is reproduce for you what is normally hidden behind the veil of private life.\". The webcasts, under its webcast title of \"Inside Creative Writing,\" have become a popular download on iTunes.\n\nButler taught creative writing from 1985 to 2000 at McNeese State University in Lake Charles, Louisiana, with his colleague John Wood, to whom he dedicated \"A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain\". He then joined the faculty of Florida State University as a Francis Eppes Distinguished Professor, holding the Michael Shaara Chair in Creative Writing, where he currently teaches.\n\nButler is a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in fiction and a National Endowment for the Arts grant, and was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award. In 2001 he won a National Magazine Award for \"Fair Warning,\" a short story that was published in the journal \"Zoetrope: All-Story\", and, four years later, he won another National Magazine Award for \"The One in White,\" a short story published in \"The Atlantic Monthly\".\n\nIn 1993, his first story collection, \"A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain\", won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. \"The New York Times\" praised the book's \"startling, dreamlike\"\nstories about the lives of Vietnamese immigrants living in Louisiana, and said it was \"remarkable not for its flaws, but for how beautifully it achieves its daring project of making the Vietnamese real.\"\nThe Pulitzer committee said that the stories \"raise the literature of the Vietnam conflict to an original and highly personal new level.\"\n\nButler also judged the annual Robert Olen Butler Prize, a short-fiction award founded and sponsored by Del Sol Press, with the most recent prize being awarded in 2010.\nHe also judges \"The Southeast Review's\" short-short story contest.\n\n\nOn August 10, 1968, Butler married Carol Supplee. They divorced in January 1972.\n\nOn July 1, 1972, Butler married poet Marylin Geller (now known professionally as Marylin Krepf).\n\nOn July 21, 1987, Butler married Maureen Donlan. They divorced in March 1995.\n\nOn April 23, 1995, at Tavern on the Green restaurant in New York City, Butler married the novelist and playwright Elizabeth Dewberry (born September 7, 1962). The couple ended their marriage in July 2007 (\"The Washington Post\" reported that they were officially divorced on July 19), according to e-mail Butler sent to his graduate students and fellow professors at Florida State University regarding Dewberry's decision to leave him for communications mogul Ted Turner. A controversy arose over the highly personal revelations contained within Butler's e-mail, which was leaked by one of its recipients and subsequently reported on by major international media outlets, such as \"The Washington Post\", \"The New York Times\", and National Public Radio.\n\nOn November 22, 2011, Butler married Kelly Lee Daniels, now known professionally as Kelly Lee Butler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In its early days and in relation to India (rather than the Ottoman possessions) it connoted not only proficiency in languages of India, but also study of the culture, and advocacy of administration of the existing legal systems and customs. This attitude was opposed by both evangelical and Utilitarian critics.\n\nScottish dominance within British orientalism at the end of the 18th century—the period after the death of Sir William Jones in 1794—was almost complete: the only leading exception was Henry Thomas Colebrooke.\n\nRendall has identified a group of Scottish oriental scholars, under the influence of Dugald Stewart and his view of \"philosophical history\". They bridge the gap between William Robertson who warned of the ethnocentrism into which the approach of stadial history could betray Europeans, and James Mill who in \"The History of British India\" embraced the assumption of European superiority, in the case of Hindu culture.

Her most successful compositions have been her orchestral works \"Alchemy\" and \"Cokaygne\" and her choral piece \"Theophilus Thistle and the Myth of Miss Muffett\". Her opera \"Vampirella\" was first performed in Dublin in March 2017.\n\nBorn in Dublin, Cleary started to compose from an early age, often writing pieces while she was supposed to be practising at the piano. When she began to study music at Maynooth University, she was initially inspired by Luciano Berio's \"Sinfonia\", and soon afterwards by the works of the Irish composer Gerald Barry, the French Olivier Messiaen and the Hungarian György Ligeti. She continued her studies at \nQueen's University Belfast and Trinity College, Dublin. In addition, she has followed courses in composition with the Italian composer Franco Donatoni and the Dutch Louis Andriessen and received private tuition from the American Tom Johnson and the South African Kevin Volans. Under the Italian composer Ennio Morricone and the American Don Brandon Ray, she has also studied film scoring.\n\nInspired by the alchemists' \"Opus Alchymicum\" which describes how cheaper metals are transmuted into gold, Cleary's orchestral work \"Alchemy\" (2001) is, like the stages in the \"Opus\", presented in four parts: it evolves from the slow \"nigrendo\", the moderate \"albedo\", the strong \"citronatus\", and the burning \"rubedo\". The work was performed by the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra in January 2002.\n\nHer tone poem \"Cokaygne\" (2009), which, like \"Alchemy\", was commissioned by RTÉ for the National Symphony Orchestra, is based on a poem and old sources which evoke a land of extreme luxury and contentment. The elaborately orchestrated piece was performed by the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra in November 2009, Vladimir Altschuler conducting. It was performed by the RTÉNSO once again in June 2016, this time under the baton of Alan Buribayev.\n\nCleary's choral work \"Theophilus Thistle and the Myth of Miss Muffett\" (2010), commissioned by the Cork Choral Festival was first performed in April 2011 by Chamber Choir Ireland directed by Paul Hillier. The work is based on a series of tongue twisters and other strange combinations of words popular in various European languages and dialects, moving from Italy, through Germany and Spain, finishing in Ireland. In 2013, it was performed twice by Chamber Choir Ireland in Dublin and Cork in connection with Ireland's presidency of the European Union. The journalist and music critic Terry Blain commented on the choir's \"dazzingly virtuosic performance\" in Belfast in 2013, qualifying the piece as \"a tour de force of 21st century vocal chicanery, a clever and richly entertaining composition\". \"Theophilus Thistle\" was also performed the same year in the United States as part of the \"Imagine Ireland\" festival.\n\nThe chamber opera \"Vampirella\" with a libretto by Katy Hayes was first performed by students from the Royal Irish Academy of Music and the Lir National Academy of Dramatic Art at Dublin's Smock Alley Theatre in March 2017. Based on a short story by Angela Carter telling how a young English soldier is seduced by a vampire countess, it was directed by Conor Hanratty and conducted by Andrew Synnott. Michael Dervan of \"The Irish Times\" found the electronic sounds in the score particularly effective, commenting: \"Perhaps this is a case of a genuinely electronic opera trying to break out of a more conventional mold.\"\n\nIn 1996, Cleary received a young artists award from \"Pépinières européennes pour jeunes artistes\", followed in 1997 by the first prize in the Arklow Music Festival Composers' Competition.

Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte who ruled France from 1848-1870. It was translated into English in 2002. Small portions were translated in 1967 as an appendix to Norman Cohn's \"Warrant for Genocide\", which identifies it as the main source of the later \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\".\n\nThe piece uses the literary device of a dialogue of the dead, invented by ancient Roman writer Lucian and introduced into the French belles-lettres by Bernard de Fontenelle in the 18th century. Shadows of the historical characters of Niccolo Machiavelli and Charles Montesquieu meet in Hell in the year 1864 and dispute on politics. In this way Joly tried to cover up a direct, and then illegal, criticism of Louis-Napoleon's rule.\n\nJoly relates in his 1870 autobiography\n\nthat one evening thinking of economist Abbé Galiani's treatise \"Dialogues sur le commerce des bleds\" (\"Dialogues on the commerce in wheat\")\nand walking by Pont Royal, he was inspired to write a dialogue between Montesquieu and Machiavelli. The noble baron Montesquieu would make the case for liberalism; the Florentine politician Machiavelli would present the case for despotism.\n\nMachiavelli claims that he \"... wouldn't even need twenty years to transform utterly the most indomitable European character and render it as a docile under tyranny as the debased people of Asia\". Montesquieu insists that the liberal spirit of the peoples is invincible. In 25 dialogues, step by step, Machiavelli, who by Joly's plot covertly represents Napoleon III, explains how he would replace freedom with despotism in any given European country: \"... Absolute power will no longer be an accident of fortune but will become a need\" of the modern society. At the end, Machiavelli prevails. In the curtain-line Montesquieu exclaims \"Eternal God, what have you permitted!...\".\nThe book was published anonymously (par un contemporain, \"by a contemporary\") in Brussels in 1864\n\nCampaigning against Napoleon III at the French constitutional referendum, 1870, Joly wrote an epilogue to his \"Dialogue\". It was published at Le Gaulois \n\nand La Cloche\n\nmagazines.\n\nIn the beginning of 20th century Joly's book was used as a basis for \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\",\nan infamous Russian-made antisemitic literary forgery. There is an abundance of evidence that \"The Protocols\" were lavishly plagiarized from Joly's book.\n\nItalian writer Umberto Eco claims\nthat in the \"Dialogue\" Joly plagiarized seven pages or more from a popular novel \"Les Mystères du peuple\" by Eugene Sue.\n"}

They emerged during a time when society, the arts, and people were changing quickly. The inner circle of this new visual art movement consisted of Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis, Gene Davis, Howard Mehring, Tom Downing, and Paul Reed.\nThe Washington Color School, a visual art movement describes a form of image making concerned primarily with color field painting, a form of non-objective or non-representational art that explored ways to use large solid areas of paint. The Washington Color School originally consisted of a group of painters who showed works in an exhibit called the \"Washington Color Painters\" at the now-defunct Washington Gallery of Modern Art in Washington from June 25 to September 5, 1965. The exhibition's organizer was Gerald \"Gerry\" Nordland and the painters who exhibited were Sam Francis, Sam Gilliam,( painter) Gene Davis, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Howard Mehring, Thomas \"Tom\" Downing, and Paul Reed. This exhibition, which subsequently traveled to several other venues in the United States, including the Walker Art Center, solidified Washington's place in the national movement and defined what is considered the city's signature art movement, according to art historians and journalists alike. When the Washington Color School earned its stripes on the national stage.\n\nThe Washington Color School artists painted largely non-representational works, and were central to the larger color field movement. Though not generally considered abstract expressionists due to the orderliness of their works and differing motivating philosophies, many parallels can be drawn between the Washington Color School and the abstract expressionists. Minimally, the use of stripes, washes, and fields of single colors of paint on canvas were common to most artists in both groups. A common technique used in the Washington Color School was \"soak staining\" or just \"staining\", where one would pour a thinned painting medium onto canvas and let it sit over time. The result would be a stain in the canvas with no visible traces of conventional application, such as brush strokes. \n\nAfter their initial benchmark exhibition, Davis, Mehring, and Reed were joined by Timothy Corkery, Willem de Looper and Jacob Kainen at The Seventeenth Area Exhibition of Artists of Washington and the Adjacent Area at The Corcoran Gallery of Art from November 12 to December 19,1965. The Eighteenth Area Exhibition at The Corcoran from November 18 to December 31,1967 again featured artists including de Looper, Corkery, Downing, Gilliam and Kainen.\n\nMany of these artists exhibited at the Jefferson Place Gallery originally directed by Alice Denney and later owned and directed by Nesta Dorrance /Sept 21,1969 Washington Post Dorrance/) Other artists associated with the group include: Anne Truitt, Mary Pinchot Meyer, Leon Berkowitz, Jacob Kainen Alma Thomas, James Hilleary, and others. The group is sometimes thought to have expanded as it achieved a dominant presence in the Washington, D.C. visual art community through the 1960s into the 1970s. Along with the original Washington Color School painters, a second generation also exhibited at Jefferson Place Gallery.(6/69 “Four Minds With It” Wash Star; Benjamin) those artists remained influential even as some of its members dispersed elsewhere.\n\nHilda Thorpe (Hilda Shapiro Thorpe) was a color field painter who made oversized paintings and paper sculptures who taught a generation of artists in the Washington, D.C. area. Other Washington Color School female artists include Anne Truitt (whose work relates to the 'minimalist-purity' side of three-dimensional painterly objects and painters), Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Alma Thomas. Other works that reflect the Washington Color School include Sam Gilliam's suspended paintings (whose style can be described by some as \"Baroque\"), Timothy Corkery’s sharp Arrows and contrasting diffuse architectural doorways. Rockne Krebs' transparent sculptures, light and laser works, Ed McGowin's vacuum-formed pieces which he was ending and moving towards a more personal art (tableau), Bill Christenberry's neon works, which led him to deal more directly with his roots, and the work of Bob Stackhouse and Tom Green. \n\nDuring spring and summer 2007, arts institutions in Washington, D.C. staged a citywide celebration of color field painting, including exhibitions at galleries and museums of works by members of the Washington Color School. In 2011, a group of Washington art collectors began the Washington Color School Project, to gather and publish information about the history of the color painters and abstract art in Washington. Though some of them were not born in Washington, they exhibited together representing Washington as a new hub for the visual arts.\n\n\n"}

Born into a theatrical family in Mexico City, she first wanted to be an actress but began writing when she was 16. All of her plays have been staged and most have been published both in Mexico and abroad. Her work has been translated into multiple languages and is regularly invited to events such as the HotInk, the Salon du Livre-Paris, the Miami International Book Fair, the Festival Internacional del Libro in Guadalajara and at The Banff Center and the Rockfeller Foundation. In 2009, she was named an “artistic creator” with Mexico’s Sistema Nacional de Creadores.\n\nEscalante was born in Mexico City in 1964. She is the granddaughter of director and producer Alvaro Custodio, who founded the Teatro Clásico de México in the 1960s.\n\nBecause of her family’s theatrical background, she wanted to become an actress when she was very young, but was told that she did not have the talent for this. However, her upbringing in the upper-class Condesa neighborhood in Condesa shaped her perspective on human relations, having contact with artists and intellectuals and spend time at the movies with the children of Alejandro Jodorowsky. However, despite this and the fact that she has written screenplays, she goes to the movies today infrequently.\n\nAt age 16 she began to write stories and novels and created her first play at that time. She entered a class taught by Hugo Argüelles and at the same time studied directing with Ludwick Margules. She then received a diploma from the Escuela de Escritores. She also took workshops with José Luis Alonso de Santos, William Layton and Juan José Gurrola.\n\nShe went to Spain to study her bachelors at the Real Escuela Superior de Arte Dramático (RESAD), majoring in writing and criticism, receiving scholarships from FONCA, the Sistema Nacional de Creadores (Jóvenes Creadores) and the Spanish Ministry of Culture and Science. Since then she has combined literature theory can criticism with her creative work.\n\nEscalante has two children and her house in Mexico City is filled with momentos from her career and travels, such as photos of artists and posters from her plays. When asked to describe herself she replied:\nI try to lead a spiritual life. I spent many years studying Sufism. I life traveling because it allows me to see places, people, theaters, books, lovers and a wonderful world. I have a difficult personality, at the same time I need much love and sweetness. I have practiced Shaolinquan and I tend to be melancholy.\nI have in me a strong struggle between my need to be alone and to be in the world. I spend many hours in fiction since my childhood and adolescence. Since childhood I have been this way. My brothers and sisters said and still say that I was autistic. Reality is not easy and I deal with it through paper and resolving things.\n\nEscalante says she is a slow writer and says only in the later career has she become more productive. However, almost all of her work has been published, and all of her plays have been staged. Her works have been translated into English, French, German, Greek, Dutch, Italian and Portuguese and have been staged in New York, Washington, Ohio, Miami, Montreal, Ottawa, Banff, Paris, Lyon, Cannes, Venice, Rome, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Antwerp, Udine, Athens, Buenos Aires, Santiago de Chile and Madrid. In Mexico, her work has been directed by the likes of Mauricio García Lozano and Francisco Franco. Escalante worked with the Nouveau Théâtre du 8 theater company in Lyon, France from 2011 to 2013 to produce a series of four plays.\n\nThe playwright has worked on various publications researched theatrical production and theory. She wrote a theater column for the newspaper Reforma from 2000 to 2006 and has written for publications associated with RESAD and UNAM.\n\nEscalante has participated in various workshops in writing and theatrical production and gives classes in dramatic literature in various institutions. She runs a theater workshop open to all ages, with one of her students, Pablo Iván García, winning the Mexicali Fine Arts Prize in 2010, for his play Micro dermo abrasión.\n\nIn 2009-2012 period, Escalante was named an “Artistic Creator” of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores. She has been invited on various occasions to the Pen Voices Festival in New York. Her works have been presented at HotInk, the Salon du Livre-Paris, the Miami International Book Fair, the Festival Internacional del Libro in Guadalajara, The Banff Center and at the Rockfeller Foundation.\n\nWhile Escalante has written movie and television scripts including screenplays with Alfonso Arau and Rafael Montero, she has focused her career mostly on writing plays.\n\nMuch of Escalante’s work is based on classic myths and stories from the Classical Greece, (especially those of Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripides) either reinterpreting them or working with characters and other elements, especially those she considers to be relevant to contemporary life. Female characters such as Phaedra, Electra, Andromache, Salome and Lilith are often the focus.\n\nIn addition to works based on ancient literature, Escalante has also created works dealing with the creative struggles of more modern writers, such as Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams, Colette, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. She even wrote one about painter Frida Kahlo.\n\nIn general Escalante’s works are tragedies which touch on love, passion and sexuality and the conflicts they generate. However, she does add touches of humor. Plays of this type include \"Fedra y otras griegas\" (2002), \"Colette\" (2005), \"Las relaciones (sexuales) de Shakespeare (y Marlowe)\" (2012) and \"Tennessee en cuerpo y alma\" (2012) . She believes it is inevitable to have plays be at least somewhat autobiographical.\n\n\n\n"}

Originally known as a \"guohua\" (traditionalist) painter, by the 1960s he was also renowned as a modern impressionist and expressionist painter. In addition, he is regarded as one of the most gifted master forgers of the twentieth century.\n\nZhang was born in 1899 in Sichuan Province to a financially struggling but artistic family. His first commission came at age 12, when a traveling fortune-teller requested he paint her a new set of divining cards. At age 17 he was captured by bandits while returning home from boarding school in Chongqing. When the bandit chief ordered him to write a letter home demanding a ransom, he was so impressed by the boy's brushmanship that he made the boy his personal secretary. During the more than three months that he was held captive, he read books of poetry which the bandits had looted from raided homes.\n\nAs a young adult Zhang moved to Kyoto to learn textile dyeing techniques. He later returned to Shanghai and established a successful career selling his paintings.\n\nThe governor of Qinghai, Ma Bufang, sent Zhang to Sku'bum to seek helpers for analyzing and copying Dunhuang's Buddhist art.\n\nDue to the political climate of China in 1949, he left the country and resided in Mendoza, Argentina, São Paulo and Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil, and then to Carmel, California, before settling in Taipei, Taiwan in 1978. During his years of wandering he had several wives simultaneously, curried favor with influential people, and maintained a large entourage of relatives and supporters. He also kept a pet gibbon. He affected the long robe and long beard of a scholar.\n\nA meeting between Zhang and Picasso in Nice, France in 1956 was viewed as a summit between the preeminent masters of Eastern and Western art. The two men exchanged paintings at this meeting.\n\nZhang's early professional painting was primarily in Shanghai. In the late 1920s he moved to Beijing where he collaborated with Pu Xinyu. In the 1930s he worked out of a studio on the grounds of the Master of the Nets Garden in Suzhou. In 1940 he led a group of artists in copying the Buddhist wall paintings in the Mogao and Yulin caves. In the late 1950s, his deteriorating eyesight led him to develop his splashed color, or \"pocai\", style. In the 1970s, he mentored painter Minol Araki.\n\nZhang's forgeries are difficult to detect for many reasons. First, his ability to mimic the great Chinese masters:\n\nSecond, he paid scrupulous attention to the materials he used. \"He studied paper, ink, brushes, pigments, seals, seal paste, and scroll mountings in exacting detail. When he wrote an inscription on a painting, he sometimes included a postscript describing the type of paper, the age and the origin of the ink, or the provenance of the pigments he had used.\"\n\nThird, he often forged paintings based on descriptions in catalogues of lost paintings; his forgeries came with ready-made provenance.\n\nZhang's forgeries have been purchased as original paintings by several major art museums in the United States, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston:\n\nArt historian James Cahill claimed that the painting \"The Riverbank\", a masterpiece from the Southern Tang dynasty, held by the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, was likely another Zhang forgery.\n\nMuseum curators are cautioned to examine Chinese paintings of questionable origins, especially those from the bird and flower genre with the query, \"Could this be by Chang Dai-chien?\" Joseph Chang, Curator of Chinese Art at the Sackler Museum, suggested that many notable collections of Chinese art contained forgeries by the master painter.\n\nIt is estimated that Zhang made more than 10 million dollars selling his forgeries.\n\n\n\n"}

The mosaic was discovered by the Italian archaeologist Salvatore Aurigemma in 1913 and is now on display at The Archaeological Museum of Tripoli. It depicts gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, and scenes from everyday life.\n\nThe mosaic was discovered in October 1913, in the ruins of a seaside Roman villa later called Villa Dar Buk Ammera after the area where it was found. When it was first fully unearthed and visible after the excavations conducted by Salvatore Aurigemma, from 22 June to 18 August 1914, it was immediately seen as a masterpiece of mosaic art, but one that was in an emergent need for preservation and restoration. In the 1920s, the mosaic was restored and placed on display at The Archaeological Museum of Tripoli. It moved with the museum to its new location in 1952 and is displayed prominently near the entrance hall.\n\nThere have been various disputes related to the dating of the mosaic, mostly based on archaeological or stylistic comparisons, but the issue remains unresolved.\n\nIn his work on the Zliten mosaics, \"Mosaici di Zliten\", 1926, Aurigemma offers an approximate dating period for the mosaic in the Flavian Dynasty years (69-96 AD). This chronology would make the mosaic one of the earliest known mosaics of North Africa. He asserts his hypothesis on three arguments:\n\nIn 1965, Georges Ville studied the mosaic based on the historical evidence provided by the costumes and weaponry of the protagonists in sections of the mosaic depicting \"venatio\" (hunting) and \"munus\" (swordsmanship). Ville found that the short-sleeved tunic and the hunters with bare, unprotected legs seem to belong to the late 1st or early 2nd century AD, whereas the type of \"thraex\" and \"murmillo\"’s helmets seem to be intermediary between that of Pompeii and that of the gladiator of Trajan period. Thus, Ville dates the mosaic from the end of the Flavian period to the early Antonine period (late 1st or early 2nd century).\nAnother stylistic comparative analysis by Roman art historian Christine Kondoleon supports an Antonine period dating as a result of the mosaic's multiple design elements. The Zliten floor mosaic employs tressed or braided twisted rope outlines to frame each panel, black backgrounds provide optical contrast and the panels alternate circular and square patterns. These features are in common with the Reggio Emilia mosaic, placed in the Antonine period. Kondoleon also asserts links between the individual designs of these mosaics, especially in the simplified floral forms and scale patterns. Finally, Kondoleon cites the inclusion of the peltarion, a type of Roman shield, as a further link in other Italian mosaics of the period.\n\nIn 1985, David Parrish, an art history professor, proposed 200 AD as the date of the mosaic, a date that coincides with the early Severan dynasty. In a comparison of the military equipment of the two Samnites in the Zliten mosaic with the warriors in the mosaic of Bad Kreuznach (Germany), dated c. 250 AD, Parrish emphasizes their similarities. He performed a similar comparison between the duels of \"retiarius\" and \"secutor\" in the Zliten mosaic and those of the mosaic of Nennig in Germany, dated c. 240-250 AD. Additionally, Parrish concludes that the mosaic of the El Djem amphitheatre, dated c. 200 AD, has particularly evident links to the Zliten mosaic in terms of the realistic rendering of space on white background, and the absence of shadows and isolated plots of land. This methodology is criticized by some scholars, including Roman art historian Katherine Dunbabin, for relying on overly broad stylistic parallels between the works.\n\nPortions of the Zliten mosaic are realized through a combination of three techniques: opus tessellatum, opus vermiculatum and opus sectile.\n\nThe external black and white geometric border is created with the opus tessellatum technique.\n\nThe central part of the mosaic is composed of geometric alternating square panels with each side measuring and realized in the opus sectile technique. Within these panels are circular \"emblemata\" depicting fish and other marine creatures (shrimp, murex, picarel, conger, sea urchin, garfish etc...) in the opus vermiculatum technique.\n\n\n"}
