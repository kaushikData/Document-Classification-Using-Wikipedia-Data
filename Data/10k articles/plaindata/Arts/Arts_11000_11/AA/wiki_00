The text of an advance edition may also differ slightly from the market book (the final version that is distributed for sale), because changes may be made after advance readers make comments or find errors in the manuscript. When a celebrity reader or journalist gives an endorsement, that may be added to the dust-cover and other promotional items.\n\nARCs are normally distributed three to six months before the book is officially released to reviewers, bookstores, magazines, and (in some cases) libraries.\n\nBook collectors often seek ARCs, which may contain text errors or typos that add value, as coins or stamps with errors do.\n\nOn rare occasions (for instance, on the publication of an eagerly awaited or controversial book), a publisher may require the recipients of an ARC to sign a confidentiality of content agreement. However, in most cases the sheer number of ARCs produced and distributed makes that impractical. A typical genre publisher will produce 5,000 ARCs for a new book by a moderately popular writer.\n\nBefore it was a common practice to produce and distribute ARCs in this way, publishers used uncorrected, bound galley proofs only for the editing and proof-reading process. Typically, they were bound in plain paper covers without illustrations, printed in black and white, and significantly larger than their market book counterparts. In contrast, ARCs usually are printed in full color, and have bindings, format, and illustrations that are similar to those of the market book. The phrase 'uncorrected proof' appears on the ARC cover.\n\nAlthough ARCs are usually free promotional items, some early versions of books, even some labeled by the publisher as ARCs, are sold to the public. An example is \"Captain Vorpatril's Alliance\" by Lois McMaster Bujold.\n\nPublishers who produce galley proofs in electronic form rather than as a physical book do not use them as ARCs. However, with the rise of ebooks and ereaders, it is now common for ARCs (in contrast to galley proofs) to be distributed as eBooks on websites such as NetGalley. Both traditionally published and self-published ARCs may be available for distribution on such sites. Recently, eARC has come into common use for advance copies of eBooks. This usage dates back to at least 2010 and was promoted by Baen Books for their trade eBooks from at least 2013 onward.\n"}

{"id": "3217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3217", "title": "Army of Darkness", "text": "Army of Darkness\n\nArmy of Darkness (referred to as Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness on its title card) is a 1992 American horror comedy film directed and co-written by Sam Raimi, co-produced by Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell and co-written by Ivan Raimi. It stars Campbell and Embeth Davidtz. It is the third installment in the \"Evil Dead\" franchise, and continuing from \"Evil Dead II,\" Ash Williams (Campbell) is trapped in the Middle Ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.\n\nThe film was produced as part of a production deal with Universal Studios after the financial success of \"Darkman\". Filming took place in California in 1991. The makeup and creature effects for the film were handled by two different companies: Tony Gardner and his company Alterian, Inc. were responsible for the Ash & Sheila makeup effects, while Kurtzman, Nicotero & Berger EFX Group was credited for the remaining special makeup effects characters.\n\n\"Army of Darkness\" premiered at the Sitges Film Festival on October 9, 1992, and was released in the United States on February 19, 1993. It grossed $21.5 million total over a $11 million budget, and received positive reviews, though notably less than the first two films. Since its video release it has acquired a cult following, along with the other two films in the trilogy. The film was dedicated to Irvin Shapiro, who died during the film's production in 1989 on New Year's Day.\n\nAfter being transported to the Middle Ages, Ash Williams is captured by Lord Arthur's men, who suspect him an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free, as he knew it was a witch hunt, and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.\n\nAccording to the Wise Man, the only way Ash can return to his time is through the magical \"Necronomicon Ex-Mortis.\" Ash then starts his search for the \"Necronomicon\". As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash into a windmill, crashing into a mirror. Small reflections of Ash in the mirror shards come to life, with one becoming a life-sized clone, after which Ash kills and buries it. \n\nWhen he arrives at the \"Necronomicon\"s location, he finds three books instead of one and determines which is the actual book. Attempting to say the phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely \"Klaatu barada nikto\" he forgets and tries to unsuccessfully mumble and cough \"nikto\". He then grabs it and rushes back, while the dead and his evil copy resurrect, uniting into the Army of Darkness.\n\nUpon return, Ash demands to be returned to his own time. However, Sheila is abducted by a Flying Deadite, and later transformed into one. Ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the Army and the people reluctantly agree. Using knowledge from textbooks in his 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88, and enlisting the help of Duke Henry, Ash successfully leads the medieval soldiers to victory over the Deadites and Evil Ash, saving Sheila and bringing peace between Arthur and Henry. The Wise Men tells him how to return to the present by giving him a potion after reciting the phrase.\n\nBack in his present time, Ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at an S-Mart department store. As he talks to a woman who is interested in his story, a surviving Deadite, allowed to come to the present due to Ash again forgetting the last word, attacks the customers. Ash kills it using a Winchester rifle from the Sporting Goods department, and exclaims \"hail to the king, baby\" before passionately kissing the woman. \n\nIn the film's original ending, Ash miscounts the amount of potion needed to be able to correctly return to his own time. As a result, he wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future where human civilization is destroyed, and he screams in dismay at having overslept. Universal Pictures objected to this climax, feeling that it was too negative in tone, and a more optimistic ending was filmed and ultimately incorporated into the theatrical cut.\n\n\nPlans to make a third \"Evil Dead\" film had been circulating for a number of years, even prior to the production of \"Darkman\". \"Evil Dead II\" made enough money internationally that Dino De Laurentiis was willing to finance a sequel. Director and script writer Sam Raimi drew from a variety of sources, including literature with \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" and Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\" and films like \"The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad\", \"Jason and the Argonauts\", The Three Stooges, and \"Conan The Barbarian\". \"Evil Dead II\", according to Bruce Campbell, \"was originally designed to go back into the past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story would ever get made\". Promotional drawings were created and published in \"Variety\" during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot. The working title for the project was \"Medieval Dead\",before it was later known as\"Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness\". The title \"Army of Darkness\" came from an idea by Irvin Shapiro, during the production of \"Evil Dead II\".\n\nInitially, Raimi invited Scott Spiegel to co-write \"Army of Darkness\" because he had done a good job on \"Evil Dead II\", but he was busy on rewrites for the Clint Eastwood film \"The Rookie\". After the good experience of writing the screenplay for a film called \"Easy Wheels\", Sam and his brother Ivan decided to co-write the film together. They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of \"Darkman\". After filming \"Darkman\", they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan \"has a good sense of character\" and that he brought more comedy into the script. Campbell remembers, \"We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'Well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting\". Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.\n\nThe initial budget was $8 million but during pre-production, it became obvious that this was not going to be enough. \"Darkman\" was also a financial success and De Laurentiis had a multi-picture deal with Universal and so \"Army of Darkness\" became one of the films. The studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget. However, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced Campbell, Raimi and producer Robert Tapert to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars. Visual effects supervisor William Mesa showed Raimi storyboards he had from Victor Fleming's film \"Joan of Arc\" that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in \"Army of Darkness\". A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the \"Joan of Arc\" storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.\n\nTraci Lords was among the actresses auditioning for the film, saying in 2001, \"I didn't get the part but I clicked with Bruce [Campbell],\" with whom she would later work as a guest star in the TV series \"\".\n\nPrincipal photography took place between soundstage and on-location work. \"Army of Darkness\" was filmed in Bronson Canyon and Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park. The interior shots were filmed on an Introvision stage in Hollywood. Raimi's use of the Introvision process was a tribute to the stop-motion animation work of Ray Harryhausen. Introvision uses front-projected images with live actors instead of the traditional rear projection that Harryhausen and others used. Introvision blended components with more realistic-looking results. To achieve this effect, Raimi used 60-foot-tall Scotchlite front-projection screens, miniatures and background plates. According to the director, the advantage of using this technique was \"the incredible amount of interaction between the background, which doesn't exist, and the foreground, which is usually your character\".\n\nShooting began in mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days. It was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near Acton, California on the edge of the Mojave Desert, the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night. Most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. It would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene. Money problems forced cinematographer Bill Pope to shoot only for certain hours Monday through Friday because he could not be paid his standard fee. Mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend.\n\nIt was a difficult shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there. Mesa remembers, \"Bruce was cussing and swearing some of the time because you had to work on the number system. Sam would tell us to make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. 'Make him go through torture!' So we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes\". Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live skeletons that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.\n\nWhile Dino De Laurentiis gave Raimi and his crew freedom to shoot the film the way they wanted, Universal took over during post-production. Universal was not happy with Raimi's cut because it did not like his original ending, feeling it was negative. In this ending, the potion Ash is given causes him to oversleep, and when he wakes up he is a futuristic, post-apocalyptic wasteland. A more upbeat ending was shot a month later in a lumber store in Malibu, California. Then, two months after principal filming was finished, a round of re-shoots began in Santa Monica and involved Ash in the windmill and the scenes with Bridget Fonda. Raimi recalls, \"Actually, I kind of like the fact that there are two endings, that in one alternate universe Bruce is screwed, and in another universe he's some cheesy hero\".\n\nRaimi needed $3 million to finish his film, but Universal was not willing to give him the money and delayed its release due to a dispute with De Laurentiis over the rights to the Hannibal Lecter character which Universal needed so that they could film a sequel to \"The Silence of the Lambs\". The matter was finally resolved, but the release date for \"Army of Darkness\"' was pushed back from summer of 1992 to February 1993.\n\nFor the film's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to take several reference head shots and asked him to strike a sly look on his face. They showed him a rough of the Frank Frazetta-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film. Raimi ran into further troubles when the Motion Picture Association of America gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being decapitated early on in the film. Universal wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an R rating. In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an R rating.\n\nDanny Elfman, who composed the score for \"Darkman\", wrote the \"March of the Dead\" theme for \"Army of Darkness\". After the re-shoots were completed, Joseph LoDuca, who composed the music for \"The Evil Dead\" and \"Evil Dead II\", returned to score the film. The composer used his knowledge of synthesizers and was able to present many cues in a mock-up form before he recorded them with the Seattle Symphony. The score was released during the MondoCon in Austin, Texas on October 3 and 4, 2015, on Vinyl, over Mondo Records.\n\n\"Army of Darkness\" was released by Universal on February 19, 1993 in 1,387 theaters in the United States, grossing $4.4 million (38.5% of total gross) on its first weekend. In total, the film earned $11.5 million in the US.\n\nThe film currently holds a 72% \"Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 46 reviews, which made its critical reception above average but much lower than \"The Evil Dead\" and \"Evil Dead II\", which received 96% and 98% respectively. On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 57 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, \"The movie isn't as funny or entertaining as \"Evil Dead II\", however, maybe because the comic approach seems recycled.\" In her review for \"The New York Times\", Janet Maslin praised, \"Mr. Campbell's manly, mock-heroic posturing is perfectly in keeping with the director's droll outlook.\" Desson Howe, in this review for \"The Washington Post\" praised the film's style: \"Bill Pope's cinematography is gymnastic and appropriately frenetic. The visual and make-up effects (from artist-technicians William Mesa, Tony Gardner and others) are incredibly imaginative.\" However, \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a \"C+\" rating and wrote, \"This spoofy cast of thousands looks a little too much like a crew of bland Hollywood extras. By the time \"Army of Darkness\" turns into a retread of \"Jason and the Argonauts\", featuring an army of fighting skeletons, the film has fallen into a ditch between parody and spectacle.\"\n\n\"Army of Darkness\" won the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film (1994). It was also nominated for Best Make-Up. \"Army of Darkness\" was nominated for the Grand Prize at Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival, and won the Golden Raven at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film in 1993. The film also won the Critics' Award at Fantasporto, and was nominated for the International Fantasy Film Award in the category of Best Film in 1993. It was also nominated for Best Film at Sitges, the Spanish International Film Festival.\n\nIn March 2013, shortly before the release of \"Evil Dead\", a reboot and loose continuation of the franchise, Raimi confirmed that the next \"Evil Dead\" film will be \"Army of Darkness 2\". Campbell confirmed that he would star as an older, but not necessarily wiser, Ash. At a WonderCon panel in March 2013, Campbell and Fede Alvarez, director of the reboot, stated that their ultimate plan was for Alvarez's \"Evil Dead 2\" and Raimi's \"Army of Darkness 2\" to be followed by a seventh film which would merge the narratives of Ash and Mia. On October 18, 2013, Campbell once again confirmed in an interview with ComicBook.com that he will be reprising his role as Ash in the sequel. Fede Alvarez posted a status update on his Twitter account that Raimi will direct the sequel. Campbell later commented that the rumor about him returning is false.\n\nIn July 2014, Campbell stated it was likely the planned sequel would instead be a TV series with him as the star. The ten-episode season of \"Ash vs Evil Dead\" premiered on Starz on October 31, 2015, with the pilot co-written and directed by Sam Raimi. Due to legal issues with Universal, the events from \"Army of Darkness\" could not specifically be mentioned in the first season. In addition to Campbell, the series stars Dana DeLorenzo, Ray Santiago, and Lucy Lawless.\n\n\"Army of Darkness\" had a comic book adaptation and several comic book sequels. The movie adaptation, from publisher Dark Horse Comics, was actually published before the film's theatrical release.\n\nEden Studios, Inc. published the \"Army of Darkness Roleplaying Game\" in 2005.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16962533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16962533", "title": "Art of the Low Countries", "text": "Art of the Low Countries\n\nThe art of the Low Countries consists of painting, sculpture, architecture, printmaking, pottery and other forms of visual art produced in the Low Countries, and since the 19th century in Belgium in the southern Netherlands and the Netherlands in the north. \n\nFrom the late Middle Ages until about 1700 the Low Countries were a leading force in the art of northern Europe, thereafter becoming less important. In the earlier High Middle Ages Mosan art, from an area partly in the Low Countries, had had a similar role.\nThe art of the Low Countries includes the traditions of Early Netherlandish painting and the Renaissance in the Low Countries, before the political separation of the region. After the separation, a protracted process lasting between 1568 and 1648, Dutch Golden Age painting in the north and Flemish Baroque painting, especially the art of Peter Paul Rubens, were the cornerstones of art. \n\nEarly Netherlandish art includes those artists who were active during the 15th and early 16th centuries in the Low Countries, especially in the flourishing cities of Bruges and Ghent. It begins approximately with the careers of Robert Campin and Hubert and Jan van Eyck around 1400 and ends with Gerard David about 1520. Other major figures include Rogier van der Weyden, Hugo van der Goes, and Petrus Christus.\n\nThe 16th century was a period of response to Italian Renaissance art and the development of several distinctly Netherlandish themes. At the start of the century Hieronymus Bosch painted fantastic images, often for courtly viewers, that left a long legacy. Jan Mabuse, Maarten van Heemskerck and Frans Floris were all instrumental in adopting Italian models and incorporating them into their own artistic language. The spread of Mannerism throughout Europe produced important forms of Northern Mannerist art in the Low Countries. Finally, Joachim Patinir was a recognized innovator of landscape painting, while Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Pieter Aertsen helped establish genre painting as a popular subject matter.\n\nThe 17th century was a period dominated by the distinct individuals Peter Paul Rubens in the Southern Netherlands and Rembrandt van Rijn in the newly independent Dutch Republic. Dutch and Flemish painters both followed many of the same themes, including still life, genre, landscape, portraiture and classicism. Other artistic tendencies clearly differentiated art in the south from the north: the Counter-Reformation, which spurred on patronage for large altarpieces in the south, was absent from the Dutch Republic, while Flemish painting did not see the development of the types of calm, single-figure genre paintings championed by the likes of Jan Vermeer.\n\nThe most famous painter from the region in the late 17th and early 18th century is Antoine Watteau, whose hometown of Valenciennes had been annexed by France a decade before he was born. Otherwise, few painters from about 1700 until the end of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1830 have been incorporated into the art historical discourse. Dutch painters such as Jacob de Wit adopted a lofty Rococo style, indebted somewhat to Rubens, for ceiling decorations, but there was little work available. Other painters, such as Cornelis Troost, looked to England and especially the works of William Hogarth, for inspiration.\n\nArt after 1830 in Belgium and the Netherlands follow separate paths as the countries further develop their own identities. James Ensor is an important figure from Belgium, while Vincent van Gogh, from the Netherlands, posthumously reached the level of modern superstar painter.\n\n"}

Arts NSW is led by its Executive Director, Mary Darwell, who reports to the Secretary of the Department of Justice, Andrew Cappie-Wood. The agency advises the Minister for the Arts, presently the Hon. Don Harwin , who is ultimately responsible to the Parliament of New South Wales. \n\nThe role of an 'arts' minister, overseeing the management and support for all cultural activities in New South Wales, before the early 1970s was an unheard of concept in politics. However, by the early 1970s, various governments in Australia recognised the need for a steering authority for state support for the arts. In response, premier Bob Askin appointed George Freudenstein as the first Minister for Cultural Activities on 11 March 1971. On his appointment Freudenstein requested the establishment of an organisation to enable him to carry out his responsibilities and the Premier agreed. On 13 May 1971 the Ministry of Cultural Activities was established, taking over responsibility for various legislation and bodies that had previously been under the purview of the Department of Education, including the Archives Office of New South Wales, Art Gallery of New South Wales, State Library of New South Wales, Australian Museum, Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, Sydney Observatory, the Advisory Committee on Cultural Grants, NSW Film Council, and the Sydney Opera House Trust. In the case of the opera house, the Ministry had responsibility for its completion and final official opening on 20 October 1973.\n\nWith Freudenstein's departure on 3 January 1975, a new Minister for Culture, Sport and Recreation was appointed and on 6 January 1975, the Ministry of Cultural Activities was replaced by the new Department of Culture, Sport and Recreation. This arrangement lasted until 14 May 1976 when the new Labor Government of Neville Wran transferred the responsibility for cultural activities to the Premier's Department. This became the Cultural Activities Division under the administration of the Premier himself. This situation continued until 1984, when Wran established the Office of the Minister for the Arts within the Premier's Department and commissioned himself with the title of Minister for the Arts.\n\nOn 15 June 1988 a Ministry for the Arts independent of the Premier's Department was established. This ministry was abolished on 3 March 2006 and its responsibilities were moved to the new Department of the Arts, Sport and Recreation. Arts NSW became the new dedicated division for the Minister and it transferred to \"Communities NSW\" in July 2009 and then the \"Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services\" from 4 April 2011. Since the appointment of Troy Grant as the minister in 2014 (who also served as the Minister for Police and Minister for Justice), Arts NSW has been within the Department of Justice.\n\nThe NSW Government’s arts portfolio is divided into Arts NSW, Screen NSW and the NSW cultural institutions – the Sydney Opera House, the State Library of New South Wales, the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Australian Museum.\n\nThe NSW performing arts sector includes 11 of Australia’s major performing arts organisations. These companies are internationally renowned and have a commitment to excellence in performance, working in the fields of dance, theatre, opera, orchestra and chamber music including The Australian Ballet, Australian Brandenburg Orchestra, Australian Chamber Orchestra, Bangarra Dance Theatre, Bell Shakespeare Company, Belvoir, Musica Viva Australia, Opera Australia, Sydney Dance Company, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and the Sydney Theatre Company.\n\nArts NSW provides support for major cultural festivals including the Biennale of Sydney, the Sydney Festival, the Sydney Film Festival, and the Sydney Writers' Festival; and some of Australia’s leading visual arts organisations including the Artspace Visual Arts Centre, the Australian Centre for Photography, d/Lux/MediaArts, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and .\n\n"}

He is best known for his 1929 interior design of the rebuilt Savoy Theatre in London.\n\nIonides was born in Scotland, the fourth son of Luke Ionides and grandson of Alexander Constantine Ionides, Greek ambassador to London. He studied at Tonbridge School and Glasgow School of Art 1900–1903. While there, he wrote architecture articles. He served his apprenticeship with Alexander Nisbet Paterson, during which he designed his first building, the double villa in Winton Drive, when he was only 18. Upon the completion of his apprenticeship in 1904 or 1905, he moved to London and joined the office first of Leonard Stokes and then of Harold Ainsworth Peto.\nIonides entered independent practice in 1908 and designed a number of English houses. During the First World War, he served in the Naval Reserve and was commissioned. He relinquished the commission, however, preferring to serve as an ordinary seaman, as he did not like giving orders to more experienced men. He was injured in 1917 and returned to private practice, particularly performing interior work.\n\nIonides married the Honourable Nellie Samuel (1883–1962), the widow of Walter Henry Levy, daughter of the 1st Viscount Bearsted, in 1930 after meeting her while he was decorating her residence in Berkeley Square. She was an expert in Oriental porcelain and collected art works, many of which were donated to Richmond Council. Basil and Nellie had one child, Adam, who died at the age of nine. The Ionides acquired Buxted Park in 1931. With a combination of Basil's discerning eye and Nellie's fortune as the Shell Oil heiress, they restored the Park and became important art collectors. But fire destroyed much of the house in 1940, and the top story was lost entirely, with much of their collection. Ionides scavenged architectural pieces from bombed-out buildings around the country with which to rebuild his stately home (now a hotel). He served as High Sheriff of Sussex for 1944.\n\nIonides was an important Art Deco designer. He was best known as the architect (with Frank A. Tugwell) for the rebuilding of the Savoy Theatre in London in 1929 and for Claridge's Restaurant. For the Savoy Hotel's restaurant, he famously sculpted Kaspar, the Black Cat, who acts as a good-luck guest at tables if thirteen would otherwise be present. He published the important books \"Colour and Interior Decoration\" in 1926 and \"Colour in Everyday Rooms\" in 1934. He also designed the interior of the ticket hall at Hounslow West tube station. Ionides was admitted to the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1931 and was elevated to Fellow in 1938. \n\nIonides died in Brighton at the age of 66 and is buried in St Margaret's Church in Buxted Park.\n\n\n"}

They are named after the Canongate, in Edinburgh.\n\n\nThe second series is sometimes taken as part of the Waverley Novels.\n\nThe MacTavish family lived near Oban in 1775. Hamish MacTavish \"Mohr\" (\"Senior\"), a daring freebooter, had met his death in an encounter with the Saxon red-coats, by whom the Highlands were garrisoned after the battle of Culloden. His wife, who had shared all his dangers, strove to inspire their only son with his father's love of adventure and hatred of servile toil; but as he grew up the lad evinced no inclination for lawless pursuits, and, unable to endure his mother's taunts at his want of spirit, enlisted in one of the regiments formed in Scotland to oppose the French in the American war of independence. Before sailing he sent her some money by Phadraick, and returned to spend a few days with her, when she fiercely reproached him for daring to act in opposition to her will, and, failing to alter his purpose, drugged his parting-cup, thus causing him to exceed his furlough, and render himself liable to the lash as a deserter. She then urged him to flee to her kinsmen, while she baffled his pursuers; but he resolved to await the arrival of the sergeant and men of his regiment who, he felt sure, would be sent to arrest him. They came and summoned him to surrender, but because they could not assure him against the lash, and provoked by his mother, he shot the sergeant dead. The other soldiers secured him, and he was marched as a prisoner to Dumbarton castle, where he was tried by court-martial and condemned to be shot. His captain and a Presbyterian minister interceded for him; but the English general in command was determined to make an example, and the next morning his sentence was carried out in the presence of his comrades.\n\nHis mother, who had attempted to follow him, was met by the minister wandering in a wild glen, and on hearing her son's fate, she uttered terrible imprecations, and renounced all further intercourse with the world. She lived, however, for many years in her lonely cottage, regarded with awe and pity by her neighbours as the victim of destiny, rather than the voluntary cause of her son's death and her own wretchedness. At length, while two women, who had been set to watch her last moments, were sleeping, she disappeared from her bed, and was never heard of again.\n\n\nIn 1795, Robin Oig was just starting from Doune with a drove of cattle for England, when his father's sister, who was supposed to be gifted with second sight, drew his dirk from the folds of his plaid, and, exclaiming that there was Saxon blood on it, induced him to entrust the weapon to Morrison, who undertook to return it when asked for. At Falkirk the Highlander met his bosom friend, Wakefield, and they travelled southwards together. Having reached Cumberland, they separated to hire pasturage for their beasts, and it happened that while the Englishman bargained with the bailiff, the Highlander came to terms with the squire, and they thus both secured the same enclosure. On discovering this, Wakefield reproached his comrade with having played him false, and, angrily refusing his offer that they should share the field, had to be content with a barren moor belonging to the landlord of the alehouse, where they had agreed to pass the night.\n\nThe squire had invited Oig to sup with him, and mentioned having passed Morrison a few miles off. On reaching the inn the Highlander met with a cold reception from the assembled company, who sided with Wakefield, and egged him on to challenge Oig to a Cumberland tussle. But the Highlander would have shaken hands, and, refusing to fight except with swords, he attempted to leave the room. Wakefield, however, opposed his doing so, and struck him senseless to the ground. Frantic with rage when he revived, and prevented by the hostess from attacking his comrade, Oig sullenly went out, warning him to beware. Striding over the moonlit moor to meet Morrison, he obtained his dirk on the pretence that he had enlisted, and, returning to the alehouse, he stabbed Wakefield through the heart.\n\nAt his trial the judge made every allowance for the provocation Oig had received, but pointed out to the jury that, as he went to recover possession of his weapon, there was ample time for his passion to have subsided, and for him to have reflected on the guilt of his meditated revenge. He was, accordingly, convicted of murder, and having been sentenced to be hanged, he met his fate with the observation, \"I give a life for the life I took, and what can I do more?\"\n\n\nGideon Gray was a surgeon who lived in Fife in the late 18th century. The surgeon's services were unexpectedly sought by a pregnant woman and her husband, who arrived in the village, as strangers, just before she gave birth. The following day the father left, and within a month the mother was carried off by her father, who persuaded Mr Gray to undertake the care and education of the boy, and deposited a thousand pounds in trust for him. Four years afterwards Mrs Gray died in giving birth to a daughter, and the two children were brought up together. At the age of fourteen Richard, who had been led by his nurse to believe himself born to wealth and honour, was informed by his guardian of his real position, and, after consulting with Mr Lawford and his companion Tom Hillary, he decided to remain an inmate of Mr Gray's family as his apprentice, with Hartley as a fellow pupil. As they grew up both the young men fell in love with Menie, and when the doctor proposed that Hartley should become his partner, and endeavour to secure her affections, it transpired that she and Richard were already secretly engaged. Hartley determined to make a voyage to India, and learnt with astonishment that his rival, at the instigation of Hillary, who was now a captain in the Company's service, intended to spend two years there before marrying, in the hope of realising a fortune.\n\nHaving obtained the money left by his grandfather in Mr Gray's hands, and enlisted as a recruit, he sailed from Edinburgh with his friend for the depot at Ryde; but, on recovering from a drinking bout before landing, he found himself in the military hospital, deserted by Tom Hillary, and robbed of all his belongings. Hartley, however, was acting as one of the medical officers, and, having earned the gratitude of the commandant, General Witherington, by successfully treating two of his children who were suffering from smallpox, was able to obtain a commission for his fellow-student. The general and his wife had discovered that Richard was their first-born, and when he was introduced to them the shock of hearing him describe himself as an orphan, deserted by his parents, caused the death of his mother, upon which the father was seized with a fit of frenzy, and on recovering could not face his son again. Hartley had, however, been previously entrusted with his history, as well as a gift of money for him, and they sailed together for Madras. Having killed his colonel in a duel, Richard fled to the court of a native prince, while Hartley obtained great reputation as a medical practitioner. One of his patients was Barak el Hadji, who promised him his influence with Hyder Ali, should he at any time need it.\nSome months afterwards he was startled by the presence of Menie Gray at a public breakfast, chaperoned by the Begum, who, he learnt, was the wealthy widow of a Rajah. At a private interview with his old master's daughter, Hartley elicited from her that she had come out at Richard's invitation to be married, and was on her way to meet him in Mysore. Mistrusting her lover, he offered his protection should she need it, and the next day he received a note from her telling him she was sold to Tippoo Saib. Unable to obtain an audience of the governor, Hartley resolved to solicit the intervention of Hyder Ali, and, having reached Seringapatam, he sought the aid of El Hadji, who introduced him to another Fakir of higher rank. Following his directions, he accompanied a troop of native cavalry to Tippoo's encampment near Bangalore, and witnessed his return thither, escorted by a magnificent bodyguard, including artillery and elephants. The Begum, who had previously arrived with her retinue, and Menie under her protection, was at once invited to an interview with the prince in his garden the following day. Accordingly, at noon the discharge of cannon announced that he had left his palace; and on the arrival of his visitor, attended by Richard as her principal officer, she was conducted to a cushion on his right hand. An attendant then proclaimed the appointment of Richard as governor of the city, and the Begum in return presented Tippoo with the litter containing Menie.\n\nThe old Fakir, however, came forward, and, throwing off his disguise, ascended the throne as Hyder Ali. Having reproved his son, he commanded him to restore the gift to the care of Hartley, but allowed the ceremony of investiture to proceed. As Richard, however, who had plotted with Paupiah to betray his trust, was about to mount the elephant in waiting for him, the Rajah made a sign, upon which the animal seized him by the neck with its trunk, and crushed him to death with its foot. The Begum was then ordered to bear her share in compensating her intended victim for the indignity she had suffered, and afterwards deprived of her power and riches. Menie returned to her native village, and the gallant Hartley died from a distemper caught in the courageous pursuit of his profession.\n\n"}
{"id": "455672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=455672", "title": "Color theory", "text": "Color theory\n\nIn the visual arts, color theory or colour theory is a body of practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination. There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the color wheel: primary color, secondary color and tertiary color. Although color theory principles first appeared in the writings of Leone Battista Alberti (c. 1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1490), a tradition of \"colory theory\" began in the 18th century, initially within a partisan controversy over Isaac Newton's theory of color (\"Opticks\", 1704) and the nature of primary colors. From there it developed as an independent artistic tradition with only superficial reference to colorimetry and vision science.\n\nThe foundations of pre-20th-century color theory were built around \"pure\" or ideal colors, characterized by different sensory experiences rather than attributes of the physical world. This has led to a number of inaccuracies in traditional color theory principles that are not always remedied in modern formulations.\n\nThe most important problem has been a confusion between the behavior of light mixtures, called additive color, and the behavior of paint, ink, dye, or pigment mixtures, called subtractive color. This problem arises because the absorption of light by material substances follows different rules from the perception of light by the eye.\n\nA second problem has been the failure to describe the very important effects of strong luminance (lightness) contrasts in the appearance of colors reflected from a surface (such as paints or inks) as opposed to colors of light; \"colors\" such as browns or ochres cannot appear in mixtures of light. Thus, a strong lightness contrast between a mid-valued yellow paint and a surrounding bright white makes the yellow appear to be green or brown, while a strong brightness contrast between a rainbow and the surrounding sky makes the yellow in a rainbow appear to be a fainter yellow, or white.\n\nA third problem has been the tendency to describe color effects holistically or categorically, for example as a contrast between \"yellow\" and \"blue\" conceived as generic colors, when most color effects are due to contrasts on three relative attributes that define all colors:\n\n\nThus, the visual impact of \"yellow\" vs. \"blue\" hues in visual design depends on the relative lightness and saturation of the hues.\n\nThese confusions are partly historical, and arose in scientific uncertainty about color perception that was not resolved until the late 19th century, when the artistic notions were already entrenched. However, they also arise from the attempt to describe the highly contextual and flexible behavior of color perception in terms of abstract color sensations that can be generated equivalently by any visual media.\n\nMany historical \"color theorists\" have assumed that three \"pure\" primary colors can mix \"all possible colors\", and that any failure of specific paints or inks to match this ideal performance is due to the impurity or imperfection of the colorants. In reality, only imaginary \"primary colors\" used in colorimetry can \"mix\" or quantify all visible (perceptually possible) colors; but to do this, these imaginary primaries are defined as lying outside the range of visible colors; i.e., they cannot be seen. Any three real \"primary\" colors of light, paint or ink can mix only a limited range of colors, called a gamut, which is always smaller (contains fewer colors) than the full range of colors humans can perceive.\n\nColor theory was originally formulated in terms of three \"primary\" or \"primitive\" colors—red, yellow and blue (RYB)—because these colors were believed capable of mixing all other colors. This color mixing behavior had long been known to printers, dyers and painters, but these trades preferred pure pigments to primary color mixtures, because the mixtures were too dull (unsaturated).\n\nThe RYB primary colors became the foundation of 18th century theories of color vision, as the fundamental sensory qualities that are blended in the perception of all physical colors and equally in the physical mixture of pigments or dyes. These theories were enhanced by 18th-century investigations of a variety of purely psychological color effects, in particular the contrast between \"complementary\" or opposing hues that are produced by color afterimages and in the contrasting shadows in colored light. These ideas and many personal color observations were summarized in two founding documents in color theory: the \"Theory of Colours\" (1810) by the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and \"The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast\" (1839) by the French industrial chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul. Charles Hayter published \"A New Practical Treatise on the Three Primitive Colours Assumed as a Perfect System of Rudimentary Information\" (London 1826), in which he described how all colours could be obtained from just three.\nSubsequently, German and English scientists established in the late 19th century that color perception is best described in terms of a different set of primary colors—red, green and blue violet (RGB)—modeled through the additive mixture of three monochromatic lights. Subsequent research anchored these primary colors in the differing responses to light by three types of color receptors or \"cones\" in the retina (trichromacy). On this basis the quantitative description of color mixture or colorimetry developed in the early 20th century, along with a series of increasingly sophisticated models of color space and color perception, such as the opponent process theory.\n\nAcross the same period, industrial chemistry radically expanded the color range of lightfast synthetic pigments, allowing for substantially improved saturation in color mixtures of dyes, paints and inks. It also created the dyes and chemical processes necessary for color photography. As a result, three-color printing became aesthetically and economically feasible in mass printed media, and the artists' color theory was adapted to primary colors most effective in inks or photographic dyes: cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY). (In printing, dark colors are supplemented by a black ink, known as the CMYK system; in both printing and photography, white is provided by the color of the paper.) These CMY primary colors were reconciled with the RGB primaries, and subtractive color mixing with additive color mixing, by defining the CMY primaries as substances that \"absorbed\" only one of the retinal primary colors: cyan absorbs only red (−R+G+B), magenta only green (+R−G+B), and yellow only blue violet (+R+G−B). It is important to add that the CMYK, or process, color printing is meant as an economical way of producing a wide range of colors for printing, but is deficient in reproducing certain colors, notably orange and slightly deficient in reproducing purples. A wider range of color can be obtained with the addition of other colors to the printing process, such as in Pantone's Hexachrome printing ink system (six colors), among others.\n\nFor much of the 19th century artistic color theory either lagged behind scientific understanding or was augmented by science books written for the lay public, in particular \"Modern Chromatics\" (1879) by the American physicist Ogden Rood, and early color atlases developed by Albert Munsell (\"Munsell Book of Color\", 1915, see Munsell color system) and Wilhelm Ostwald (Color Atlas, 1919). Major advances were made in the early 20th century by artists teaching or associated with the German Bauhaus, in particular Wassily Kandinsky, Johannes Itten, Faber Birren and Josef Albers, whose writings mix speculation with an empirical or demonstration-based study of color design principles.\n\nFor the mixing of colored light, Isaac Newton's color wheel is often used to describe complementary colors, which are colors which cancel each other's hue to produce an achromatic (white, gray or black) light mixture. Newton offered as a conjecture that colors exactly opposite one another on the hue circle cancel out each other's hue; this concept was demonstrated more thoroughly in the 19th century.\n\nA key assumption in Newton's hue circle was that the \"fiery\" or maximum saturated hues are located on the outer circumference of the circle, while achromatic white is at the center. Then the saturation of the mixture of two spectral hues was predicted by the straight line between them; the mixture of three colors was predicted by the \"center of gravity\" or centroid of three triangle points, and so on.\n\nAccording to traditional color theory based on subtractive primary colors and the RYB color model, yellow mixed with purple, orange mixed with blue, or red mixed with green produces an equivalent gray and are the painter's complementary colors. These contrasts form the basis of Chevreul's law of color contrast: colors that appear together will be altered as if mixed with the complementary color of the other color. Thus, a piece of yellow fabric placed on a blue background will appear tinted orange, because orange is the complementary color to blue.\n\nHowever, when complementary colors are chosen based on definition by light mixture, they are not the same as the artists' primary colors. This discrepancy becomes important when color theory is applied across media. Digital color management uses a hue circle defined according to additive primary colors (the RGB color model), as the colors in a computer monitor are additive mixtures of light, not subtractive mixtures of paints.\n\nOne reason the artist's primary colors work at all is that the imperfect pigments being used have sloped absorption curves, and thus change color with concentration. A pigment that is pure red at high concentrations can behave more like magenta at low concentrations. This allows it to make purples that would otherwise be impossible. Likewise, a blue that is ultramarine at high concentrations appears cyan at low concentrations, allowing it to be used to mix green. Chromium red pigments can appear orange, and then yellow, as the concentration is reduced. It is even possible to mix very low concentrations of the blue mentioned and the chromium red to get a greenish color. This works much better with oil colors than it does with watercolors and dyes.\n\nSo the old primaries depend on sloped absorption curves and pigment leakages to work, while newer scientifically derived ones depend solely on controlling the amount of absorption in certain parts of the spectrum.\n\nAnother reason the correct primary colors were not used by early artists is that they were not available as durable pigments. Modern methods in chemistry were needed to produce them.\n\nThe distinction between \"warm\" and \"cool\" colors has been important since at least the late 18th century. The contrast, as traced by etymologies in the Oxford English Dictionary, seems related to the observed contrast in landscape light, between the \"warm\" colors associated with daylight or sunset, and the \"cool\" colors associated with a gray or overcast day. Warm colors are often said to be hues from red through yellow, browns and tans included; cool colors are often said to be the hues from blue green through blue violet, most grays included. There is historical disagreement about the colors that anchor the polarity, but 19th-century sources put the peak contrast between red orange and greenish blue.\n\nColor theory has described perceptual and psychological effects to this contrast. Warm colors are said to advance or appear more active in a painting, while cool colors tend to recede; used in interior design or fashion, warm colors are said to arouse or stimulate the viewer, while cool colors calm and relax. Most of these effects, to the extent they are real, can be attributed to the higher saturation and lighter value of warm pigments in contrast to cool pigments. Thus, brown is a dark, unsaturated warm color that few people think of as visually active or psychologically arousing.\n\nContrast the traditional warm–cool association of color with the color temperature of a theoretical radiating black body, where the association of color with temperature is reversed. For instance, the hottest stars radiate blue light (i.e., with shorter wavelength and higher frequency), and the coolest radiate red. \n\nThis contrast is further seen in the psychological associations of colors with the Relativistic Doppler effect seen in astronomical objects. Traditional psychological associations, where warm colors are associated with advancing objects and cool colors with receding objects, are directly opposite those seen in astrophysics, where stars or galaxies moving towards our viewpoint from Earth are blueshifted (advancing) and stars or galaxies moving away from Earth are redshifted (receding).\n\nAny color that lacks strong chromatic content is said to be \"unsaturated\", \"achromatic\", \"near neutral\", or \"neutral\". Near neutrals include browns, tans, pastels and darker colors. Near neutrals can be of any hue or lightness. Pure achromatic, or \"neutral\" colors include black, white and all grays.\n\n\"Near neutrals\" are obtained by mixing pure colors with white, black or grey, or by mixing two complementary colors. In color theory, neutral colors are easily modified by adjacent more saturated colors and they appear to take on the hue complementary to the saturated color; e.g., next to a bright red couch, a gray wall will appear distinctly greenish. \n\nBlack and white have long been known to combine \"well\" with almost any other colors; black decreases the apparent \"saturation\" or \"brightness\" of colors paired with it, and white shows off all hues to equal effect.\n\nWhen mixing colored light (additive color models), the achromatic mixture of spectrally balanced red, green and blue (RGB) is always white, not gray or black. When we mix colorants, such as the pigments in paint mixtures, a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma, or saturation, than the parent colors. This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color—a gray or near-black. Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness, or energy level; in painting, lightness is adjusted through mixture with white, black or a color's complement.\n\nIt is common among some painters to darken a paint color by adding black paint—producing colors called \"shades\"—or lighten a color by adding white—producing colors called \"tints\". However it is not always the best way for representational painting, as an unfortunate result is for colors to also shift in hue. For instance, darkening a color by adding black can cause colors such as yellows, reds and oranges, to shift toward the greenish or bluish part of the spectrum. Lightening a color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue when mixed with reds and oranges. Another practice when darkening a color is to use its opposite, or complementary, color (e.g. purplish-red added to yellowish-green) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue, and darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color. When lightening a color this hue shift can be corrected with the addition of a small amount of an adjacent color to bring the hue of the mixture back in line with the parent color (e.g. adding a small amount of orange to a mixture of red and white will correct the tendency of this mixture to shift slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum).\n\nIn painting and other visual arts, two-dimensional color wheels or three-dimensional color solids are used as tools to teach beginners the essential relationships between colors. The organization of colors in a particular color model depends on the purpose of that model: some models show relationships based on human color perception, whereas others are based on the color mixing properties of a particular medium such as a computer display or set of paints.\n\nThis system is still popular among contemporary painters, as it is basically a simplified version of Newton's geometrical rule that colors closer together on the hue circle will produce more vibrant mixtures. However, with the range of contemporary paints available, many artists simply add more paints to their palette as desired for a variety of practical reasons. For example, they may add a scarlet, purple and/or green paint to expand the mixable gamut; and they include one or more dark colors (especially \"earth\" colors such as yellow ochre or burnt sienna) simply because they are convenient to have premixed. Printers commonly augment a CMYK palette with spot (trademark specific) ink colors.\n\nIt has been suggested that \"Colors seen together to produce a pleasing affective response are said to be in harmony\". However, color harmony is a complex notion because human responses to color are both affective and cognitive, involving emotional response and judgment. Hence, our responses to color and the notion of color harmony is open to the influence of a range of different factors. These factors include individual differences (such as age, gender, personal preference, affective state, etc.) as well as cultural, sub-cultural and socially-based differences which gives rise to conditioning and learned responses about color. In addition, context always has an influence on responses about color and the notion of color harmony, and this concept is also influenced by temporal factors (such as changing trends) and perceptual factors (such as simultaneous contrast) which may impinge on human response to color. The following conceptual model illustrates this 21st century approach to color harmony:\n\nformula_1\n\nWherein color harmony is a function (\"f\") of the interaction between color/s (Col 1, 2, 3, …, \"n\") and the factors that influence positive aesthetic response to color: individual differences (\"ID\") such as age, gender, personality and affective state; cultural experiences (\"CE\"), the prevailing context (\"CX\") which includes setting and ambient lighting; intervening perceptual effects (\"P\") and the effects of time (\"T\") in terms of prevailing social trends.\n\nIn addition, given that humans can perceive over 2.8 million different hues, it has been suggested that the number of possible color combinations is virtually infinite thereby implying that predictive color harmony formulae are fundamentally unsound. Despite this, many color theorists have devised formulae, principles or guidelines for color combination with the aim being to predict or specify positive aesthetic response or \"color harmony\". \n\nColor wheel models have often been used as a basis for color combination principles or guidelines and for defining relationships between colors. Some theorists and artists believe juxtapositions of complementary color will produce strong contrast, a sense of visual tension as well as \"color harmony\"; while others believe juxtapositions of analogous colors will elicit positive aesthetic response. Color combination guidelines (or formulas) suggest that colors next to each other on the color wheel model (analogous colors) tend to produce a single-hued or monochromatic color experience and some theorists also refer to these as \"simple harmonies\".\n\nIn addition, split complementary color schemes usually depict a modified complementary pair, with instead of the \"true\" second color being chosen, a range of analogous hues around it are chosen, i.e. the split complements of red are blue-green and yellow-green. A triadic color scheme adopts any three colors approximately equidistant around a color wheel model. Feisner and Mahnke are among a number of authors who provide color combination guidelines in greater detail.\n\nColor combination formulae and principles may provide some guidance but have limited practical application. This is because of the influence of contextual, perceptual and temporal factors which will influence how color/s are perceived in any given situation, setting or context. Such formulae and principles may be useful in fashion, interior and graphic design, but much depends on the tastes, lifestyle and cultural norms of the viewer or consumer.\n\nAs early as the ancient Greek philosophers, many theorists have devised color associations and linked particular connotative meanings to specific colors. However, connotative color associations and color symbolism tends to be culture-bound and may also vary across different contexts and circumstances. For example, red has many different connotative and symbolic meanings from exciting, arousing, sensual, romantic and feminine; to a symbol of good luck; and also acts as a signal of danger. Such color associations tend to be learned and do not necessarily hold irrespective of individual and cultural differences or contextual, temporal or perceptual factors. It is important to note that while color symbolism and color associations exist, their existence does not provide evidential support for color psychology or claims that color has therapeutic properties.\n\nThere are tried and true formulae for finding colour harmony. To use these formulas all that is needed is to choose a section (or sections) of the color wheel.\n\nThe monochromatic formula chooses only one color (or hue). Variations of the color are created by changing the value and saturation of the color. Since only one hue is used, the color and its variations are guaranteed to work.\n\nColour theory has not developed an explicit explanation of how specific media affect color appearance: colors have always been defined in the abstract, and whether the colors were inks or paints, oils or watercolors, transparencies or reflecting prints, computer displays or movie theaters, was not considered especially relevant. Josef Albers investigated the effects of relative contrast and color saturation on the illusion of transparency, but this is an exception to the rule.\n\n"}
{"id": "147234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147234", "title": "Comics Code Authority", "text": "Comics Code Authority\n\nThe Comics Code Authority (CCA) was formed in 1954 by the Comics Magazine Association of America as an alternative to government regulation, to allow the comic publishers to self-regulate the content of comic books in the United States. Its code, commonly called \"the Comics Code\", lasted until the early 21st century. Many have linked the CCA's formation to a series of Senate hearings and the publication of psychiatrist Fredric Wertham's book \"Seduction of the Innocent\".\n\nMembers submitted comics to the CCA, which screened them for adherence to its Code, then authorized the use of their seal on the cover if the book was found to be in compliance. At the height of its influence, it was a \"de facto\" censor for the U.S. comic book industry.\n\nBy the early 2000s, publishers bypassed the CCA and Marvel Comics abandoned it in 2001. By 2010, only three major publishers still adhered to it: DC Comics, Archie Comics, and Bongo Comics. Bongo broke with the CCA in 2010. DC and Archie followed in January 2011, rendering the Code completely defunct.\n\nThe Comics Magazine Association of America (CMAA) was formed in September 1954 in response to a widespread public concern over gory and horrific comic-book content. It named New York Magistrate Charles F. Murphy, 44, a specialist in juvenile delinquency, to head the organization and devise a self-policing \"code of ethics and standards\" for the industry. He established the Comics Code Authority (CCA), basing its code upon the largely unenforced code drafted by the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers in 1948, which in turn had been modeled loosely after the 1930 Hollywood Production Code. This code banned graphic depictions of violence and gore in crime and horror comics, as well as the sexual innuendo of what aficionados refer to as \"good girl art\". Fredric Wertham's 1954 book \"Seduction of the Innocent\" had rallied opposition to this type of material in comics, arguing that it was harmful to the children who made up a large segment of the comic book audience. The Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency hearings in 1954, which focused specifically on comic books, had many publishers concerned about government regulation, prompting them to form a self-regulatory body instead.\n\nBefore the CCA was adopted, some cities already had organized public burnings and bans on comic books. The city councils of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Houston, Texas, passed ordinances banning crime and horror comics, although an attempt by Los Angeles County, California was deemed unconstitutional by the courts.\n\nLike the previous code, the CCA prohibited the presentation of \"policemen, judges, government officials, and respected institutions … in such a way as to create disrespect for established authority.\" But it added the requirements that \"in every instance good shall triumph over evil\" and discouraged \"instances of law enforcement officers dying as a result of a criminal's activities.\" Specific restrictions were placed on the portrayal of kidnapping and concealed weapons. Depictions of \"excessive violence\" were forbidden, as were \"lurid, unsavory, gruesome illustrations.\" Vampires, werewolves, ghouls and zombies could not be portrayed. In addition, comics could not use the words \"horror\" or \"terror\" in their titles. The use of the word \"crime\" was subject to numerous restrictions. Where the previous code had condemned the publication of \"sexy, wanton comics,\" the CCA was much more precise: depictions of \"sex perversion\", \"sexual abnormalities\", and \"illicit sex relations\" as well as seduction, rape, sadism, and masochism were specifically forbidden. In words echoing the Hollywood Production Code, love stories were enjoined to emphasize the \"sanctity of marriage\" and those portraying scenes of passion were advised to avoid stimulating \"lower and baser emotions.\"\n\nIn his introduction to \"Archie Americana Series Best of the Fifties\", editor Victor Gorelick reminisced about the Code, writing, \"My first assignment, as a new art assistant, was to remove cleavages and lift up low cut blouses on Katy Keene.\" He also wrote of Archie artist Harry Lucey that, \"His sometimes suggestive storytelling – and he was one of the best – almost cost him his job. When his pencilled stories came in, the characters were dressed on one page only. The inker, a woman by the name of Terry Szenics, would have to clothe them on the remaining pages.\"\n\nAlthough the CCA had no official control over publishers, most distributors refused to carry comics that did not carry the seal. However, two major publishers of comics – Dell Comics and Gold Key Comics – did not display the seal because their output was subject to a higher authority: their licensors.\n\nSome publishers thrived under these restrictions, while others adapted by canceling titles and focusing on Code-approved content; still others went out of business. In practice, the negative effect for not having CCA approval was lack of distribution from comic book wholesalers, who, as one historian observed, \"served as the enforcement arm of the Comics Code Authority by agreeing to handle only those comics with the seal.\"\n\nPublisher William Gaines believed that clauses forbidding the words \"crime\", \"horror\", and \"terror\" in comic book titles had been deliberately aimed at his own best-selling titles \"Crime SuspenStories\", \"The Vault of Horror\", and \"Tales from the Crypt\". These restrictions, as well as those banning vampires, werewolves, and zombies, helped make EC Comics unprofitable; all of its titles except \"Mad\" were canceled in the year following the CCA's introduction, and attempts by EC to launch Code-friendly replacement titles were unsuccessful. \"Mad\" itself survived because Gaines had converted the publication to a magazine format, to which the Code did not apply.\n\nWertham dismissed the Code as an inadequate half-measure. Comics analyst Scott McCloud, on the other hand, later commented that it was as if, in drawing up the code, \"the list of requirements a film needs to receive a G rating was doubled, and there were no other acceptable ratings!\"\n\nIn one early confrontation between a comic-book publisher and Code authorities, EC Comics' William Gaines reprinted the story \"Judgment Day\", from the pre-Code \"Weird Fantasy\" #18 (April 1953), in \"Incredible Science Fiction\" #33 (Feb. 1956). The reprint was a replacement for a Code-disapproved story – \"An Eye for an Eye\", drawn by Angelo Torres – but was itself also objected to because of the central character being black. The story, by writer Al Feldstein and artist Joe Orlando, was an allegory against race prejudice, which point was necessarily nullified if the lead character was not black. Following an order by Code administrator Judge Charles Murphy to change the final panel, which depicted a black astronaut, Gaines engaged in a heated dispute with Murphy. He threatened to inform the press of Murphy's objection to the story if they did not give the issue the Code Seal, causing Murphy to reverse his initial decision and allow the story to run. Soon after, however, facing the severe restrictions placed upon his comics by the CCA, and with his \"New Direction\" titles floundering, Gaines quit comic book publishing to concentrate on \"Mad\".\n\nSource:\n\nIn the late 1960s, the underground comics scene arose, with artists such as Robert Crumb creating comics that delved into graphic subject matter banned by the Code. Since these comics were distributed largely through unconventional channels, such as head shops, they were able to skirt the problem of mainstream distributors who were wary of carrying non-CCA-approved comics. This allowed underground comics to achieve moderate success without CCA approval.\n\nWriter Marv Wolfman's name was briefly a point of contention between DC Comics and the CCA. In the supernatural-mystery anthology \"House of Secrets\" #83 (Jan. 1970), the book's host introduces the story \"The Stuff that Dreams are Made of\" as one told to him by \"a wandering wolfman\". (All-capitals comics lettering made no distinction between \"wolfman\" and \"Wolfman\".) The CCA rejected the story and flagged the \"wolfman\" reference as a violation. Fellow writer Gerry Conway explained to the CCA that the story's author was in fact named Wolfman, and asked whether it would still be in violation if that were clearly stated. The CCA agreed that it would not be, as long as Wolfman received a writer's credit on the first page of the story; this led to DC beginning to credit creators in its supernatural-mystery anthologies.\n\nThe Code was revised a number of times during 1971, initially on January 28, 1971, to allow for, among other things, the sometimes \"sympathetic depiction of criminal behavior... [and] corruption among public officials\" (\"as long as it is portrayed as exceptional and the culprit is punished\") as well as permitting some criminal activities to kill law-enforcement officers and the \"suggestion but not portrayal of seduction.\" Also newly allowed were \"vampires, ghouls and werewolves... when handled in the classic tradition such as Frankenstein, Dracula, and other high calibre literary works written by Edgar Allan Poe, Saki, Conan Doyle and other respected authors whose works are read in schools around the world\". Zombies, lacking the requisite \"literary\" background, remained taboo. To get around this restriction, Marvel in the mid-1970s called the apparently deceased, mind-controlled followers of various Haitian supervillains \"zuvembies\". This practice carried over to Marvel's superhero line: in \"The Avengers\", when the reanimated superhero Wonder Man returns from the dead, he is referred to as a \"zuvembie\". DC comics published their own zombie story in Swamp Thing #16 (May 1975), where the deceased rise from their graves, while a soul-devouring demon appears in Swamp Thing #15 (April 1975).\n\nAround this time, the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare approached Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee to do a story about drug abuse. Lee agreed and wrote a three-part \"Spider-Man\" story, portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous. While the Code did not specifically forbid depictions of drugs, a general clause prohibited \"All elements or techniques not specifically mentioned herein, but which are contrary to the spirit and intent of the code, and are considered violations of good taste or decency\". The CCA had approved at least one previous story involving drugs, the premiere of Deadman in \"Strange Adventures\" #205 (Oct. 1967), which clearly depicted the title character fighting opium smugglers. However, Code administrator Leonard Darvin \"was ill\" at the time of the Spider-Man story, and acting administrator John L. Goldwater (publisher of Archie Comics) refused to grant Code approval because of the depiction of narcotics being used, regardless of the context, whereas the \"Deadman\" story had depicted only a wholesale business transaction.\n\nConfident that the original government request would give him credibility, and with the approval of his publisher Martin Goodman, Lee ran the story in \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #96–98 (May–July 1971), without CCA approval. The storyline was well received, and the CCA's argument for denying approval was deemed counterproductive. \"That was the only big issue that we had\" with the Code, Lee recalled in a 1998 interview:\n\nLee and Marvel drew criticism from DC head Carmine Infantino \"for defying the code\", stating that DC will not \"do any drug stories unless the code is changed\". As a result of publicity surrounding the Department of Health, Education and Welfare's sanctioning of the storyline, however, the CCA revised the Code to permit the depiction of \"narcotics or drug addiction\" if presented \"as a vicious habit\". DC itself broached the topic in the Code-approved \"Green Lantern/Green Arrow\" #85 (Sept. 1971), with writer Denny O'Neil and artist Neal Adams beginning a story arc involving Green Arrow's teen sidekick Speedy as a heroin addict. A cover line read, \"DC attacks youth's greatest problem... Drugs!\"\n\nBy the 1980s, greater depiction of violence had become acceptable. For example, Moon Knight #21 (July. 1982) encounters zombies, and \"Elvira's House of Mystery\" #2 (Feb. 1986) contained numerous decapitations but was still Code-approved.\n\nA late adopter of the code was Now Comics, which began displaying the Code seal on titles released in the spring of 1989. Bongo Comics, established in 1993 primarily to publish comics based upon \"The Simpsons\" television series, also chose to display the seal.\n\nBy the 2000s, advertisers no longer made decisions to advertise based on the appearance of the stamp. Most new publishers to emerge during this time did not join the CCA, regardless of whether their content conformed to its standards. DC Comics, Marvel Comics, and other CCA sponsors began publishing comics intended for adult audiences, without the CCA seal, and comics labeled for \"mature readers\" under imprints such as DC's Vertigo and Marvel's Epic Comics, and DC Comics imprints Helix and WildStorm were not submitted to the CCA.\n\nIn 2001, Marvel Comics withdrew from the CCA in favor of its own Marvel Rating System designating appropriate age groups; in 2010 Bongo Comics discontinued using the Code without any announcements regarding its abandonment.\n\nThe CMAA, at some point in the 2000s, was managed by the trade-organization management firm the Kellen Company, which ceased its involvement in 2009. In 2010, some publishers, including Archie, placed the seal on its comics without submitting them to the CMAA. Archie Comics President Mike Pellerito stated that the code did not affect his company the way that it did others as \"we aren't about to start stuffing bodies into refrigerators\".\n\nIn January 2011, DC Comics announced that it would discontinue participation, adopting a rating system similar to Marvel's. The company noted that it submitted comics for approval through December 2010, but would not say to whom they were submitted. A day later, Archie Comics, the only other publisher still participating in the Code, announced it also was discontinuing it, rendering the Code defunct.\n\nThe Comic Book Legal Defense Fund acquired, from the defunct CMAA, the intellectual property rights to the Comics Code seal.\n\n\n\n"}

He attended primary school in his native city from 1856 to 1860, followed by high school from 1860 to 1867. His classmates there included Alexandru Lambrior, George Panu and Calistrat Hogaș. From 1867 to 1869, he attended the literature and philosophy faculty of Iași University, and at the same time worked as a substitute Latin teacher. From 1869 to 1870, Dimitrescu-Iași taught at Botoșani. He again taught at Iași from 1870 to 1872, continuing his university studies in the process. From 1872 to 1875, he was a teacher in Bârlad. He then went to Germany to study at the universities of Berlin (1875-1876) and Leipzig (1876-1877). From 1879 to 1885, he taught aesthetics, history of philosophy, logic, psychology and pedagogy at Iași University.\n\nIn 1885, Dimitrescu-Iași transferred to Bucharest University, where he taught history of ancient and modern philosophy, ethics and aesthetics until his retirement in 1919. An inspector general with the Education Minister, he was also director of the Iași higher normal school, of the Bucharest University Library (1898-1910) and of the pedagogic seminary run by the university (1899-1919). He served as rector of Bucharest University for twelve years, from October 1898 to January 1911. Although he joined \"Junimea\" in 1878, Dimitrescu-Iași did not endorse its political orientation, indeed condemning its positions in a series of articles that appeared in \"Drapelul\" and \"Democrația\" from 1897 to 1898. Dimitrescu-Iași led \"Revista pedagogică\" magazine from 1891 to 1898 and was quite familiar with the principles of modern pedagogy. A close associate of Spiru Haret, he made a substantial contribution to the 1898 law for the reform of secondary and higher education. He died in Turnu Severin.\n\nHis philosophical outlook was deeply influenced by the European positivism and evolutionism of the 19th century's second half, from which he adopted numerous ideas, sometimes uncritically. Dimitrescu-Iași considered that people were machines in motion, mere complexes of physiological phenomena. An adherent of a monism tinged with materialism, he believed in the unity of matter and spirit and advocated an ethics based on scientific data. He was the first to teach sociology in Romania; his courses were based on Darwinist arguments. In his teaching, he helped circulate certain socialist ideas, but was against their practical application. He wrote several studies on the sociology of literature (\"Recenzentul\"; \"Spiritul democratic în literatură, arte, știință\") that did not consistently apply rigorous argumentation.\n\nIn the field of aesthetics, Dimitrescu-Iași attempted to reconcile positivism and evolutionism with the ideas of Romantic German philosophy, starting from Johann Friedrich Herbart's formalism, of which he considered himself a disciple. He set forth his ideas in \"Der Schönheitsbegriff\" (\"The Concept of the Beautiful\"), which he partly translated in 1895 in \"România literară și științifică\", as well as in several articles that appeared under the pen name Faust in the newspapers \"Dreptatea\" (1896), \"Drapelul\" and \"Democrația\" (1896-1898). He played an important role in leading Romanian aesthetics toward a more precise understanding of the role and function of art in society. Emphasizing the importance of the natural sciences for aesthetics, he tended to base his opinions on the experimental sciences. He believed that beauty could be explained by experimental methods working together with psychology, particularly those of Völkerpsychologie. Using Herbart's opinions and the experimental findings of Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Fechner, Adolf Zeising, Friedrich Theodor Vischer and Robert von Zimmermann, he distinguished between two aspects of beauty (one purely formal and objective, the other subjective), and theorized that their coming into harmony defined beauty's essence.\n\nFor Dimitrescu-Iași, poetic beauty was purely subjective, based on imagination and feeling; the term \"beauty\" in this case was merely a convention, and the material itself comprised its imagery. But poetic creations could only be considered beautiful through the lens of formal relations between images, the only ones which defined their originality. The artist was seen as a superior being in terms of physiological development, giving rise to the notion of \"dynasties of talent\". However, these are influenced by their natural and social surroundings, which explains the appearance of creative individuals under democratic conditions.\n\nHis view of literary criticism was that the discipline needed to avoid a mechanical application of aesthetic theories, instead explaining the origin, development and dissipation of literary trends. By adhering to objectivity, it forms judgments based not on the value of the work's subject, but on the originality of formal relations and the author's sincerity. This is because in art, beauty is equivalent to truth, and is more thoroughly explained by the laws of emotional life. Some of his opinions allowed him to understand and sympathize with many of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea's principles, whom he assisted in his journalistic activity.\n"}
{"id": "36916048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36916048", "title": "Dardanella (theatre company)", "text": "Dardanella (theatre company)\n\nDardanella was a touring theatre company from the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) established by Willy A. Piedro in 1926. Arising from a background of musical theatre, the troupe focused on realistic stories, both adaptations of foreign works and original stage plays about life in the Indies. Starring Dewi Dja' and Tan Tjeng Bok, the troupe performed original works by Piedro and Andjar Asmara. Popular both in the Indies and abroad, Dardanella dissolved during an international tour after 1936. Several of its members later went into film.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the theatre in the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) generally emphasised music, with the dialogue being sung. These early performances were given different names depending on their type, such as \"bangsawan\" and \"komedi stambul\". In the mid-1920s companies in the country began adapting more European stylings, with an emphasis on spoken dialogue and a reduction in the amount of music used during the performance; troupes using this new format referred to the genre as \"toneel\", an adaptation of the Dutch word for theatre.\n\nDardanella was established by Willy A. Piedro (born Willy Klimanoff), a Penang-born actor of Russian descent. His native wife, Dewi Dja' (also spelled Devi), joined as an actor; another early member was Tan Tjeng Bok, an ethnic Chinese \"keroncong\" singer who was known for his sword work, Ferry Kock, and Astaman; many of these actors had been in other troupes before. The troupe gave their first performance on 21 June 1926 in Sidoarjo, East Java. They were advertised as a \"toneel\" troupe to indicate their affinity for European stage traditions.\n\nInitially the troupe's works were written by Piedro. He adapted numerous Hollywood productions for the stage, including \"The Mark of Zorro\" (1920), \"The Three Musketeers\" (1921), \"The Thief of Bagdad\" (1924), and \"Don Q, Son of Zorro\" (1925). These adaptations generally starred Tan Tjeng Bok, who earned the nickname \"Douglas Fairbanks of Java\" (\"\") for his work. Piedro also wrote his own stage plays based on everyday life in the Indies (mostly in Java), such as \"Roos van Serang\", \"Fatima\", and \"North of Borneo\".\n\nThe group attracted the theatre and film critic Andjar Asmara in November 1930; he left his publication \"Doenia Film\" to join as he believed the troupe dedicated to the betterment of the \"toneel\" as an art form and not only motivated by financial interests like the earlier \"stambul\" troupes. Andjar's wife Ratna also joined. He numerous wrote stage plays for the troupe, generally dealing with more serious and mature topics than Piedro; these were in part aimed at the growing intellectual native population.\n\nDardanella began losing its popularity in the early 1930s. In 1936 Dardanella went to India to record a film adaptation of Andjar's \"Dr Samsi\", which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous Indo discovered he had an illegitimate child. This plan was not brought to fruition, and afterwards Piedro, Dja', and some thirty-odd players went to the United States via Egypt and Europe, soon disbanding. Meanwhile, Andjar and Ratna Asmara returned to the Indies, establishing their own troupe named Bollero with Bachtiar Effendi, who had joined Dardanella shortly before its dissolution.\n\nIn the 1940s numerous former Dardanella actors and personnel entered the film industry, including Andjar and Ratna Asmara, as well as Ferry Kock and his wife Dewi Mada. Several stage plays used by the troupe were also adapted to film, including \"Rentjong Atjeh\" (\"Rencong of Aceh\"; 1940), and \"Gadis Desa\" (\"Maiden from the Village\"; 1949).\n\nTheir plays were presented in Malay and often adapted works by other writers. Some works, such as those by Victor Ido, were translated from the original when adapted for stage. Dardanella and its contemporary rival Miss Riboet's Orion – established a year before – were some of the first travelling troupes in the Indies to use original works; earlier \"bangsawan\" and \"stambul\" troupes had used broad outlines of foreign works. The two were the most popular troupes from the Indies of their time.\n\nA review in \"The Straits Times\" following a performance of \"The Worshippers of Papua\" in 1935 found the troupe's performances comparable to those of European theatrical acts and notes that large European audiences attended the shows. The reviewer described the show as \"entertaining [audiences] in a way they had never been entertained before\".\n\nThe Indonesian cultural critic Hairus Salim HS notes that Dardanella's use of Malay in a time of increased nationalism worked to unite the different peoples of the archipelago with a single language; he also cites the diverse cultural background of its players as presenting a single but varied Indonesian identity.\n\n"}

It originally belonged to the Krabice of Veitmile family that purchased Košátky fortress in 1420, and its actual owner was in all likelihood Beneš Krabice of Veitmile (Benesch von Weitmühl), the chronicler and director of the construction of St Vitus Cathedral. From this family, the picture came into the Kolowrat family through marriage. The Kolowrats owned it until 1946. The picture is now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n\nThe picture is painted in tempera on an oak panel covered with stretched canvas. A preparatory drawing is etched into the chalk base and its contours outlined in black.\n\nThe work is a highly advanced example of the Gothic style, combining elements of Northern European Gothic and the strong influence of Italian, more specifically Sienese painting. It was painted by an unknown master during the reign of Charles IV and belongs to the broader circle of paintings executed in a similar way, such as the Vyšší Brod Altarpiece, the Kaufmann Crucifixion and the panels of the Morgan Collection (the \"Small Morgan Panels\"). The panel was probably originally the wing of a diptych, the second part of which was the Wrocław Holy Trinity.\n\nIn the quality of its execution, the picture ranks among the finest known works dating from the 14th century. It is at the same time the most Italian work of the entire Bohemian school. The construction of space reveals that the artist was acquainted with the central Italian painting of Siena (namely that of Simone Martini). Its composition is monumental and complex, while the facial type is derived from the Venetian school (namely Paolo di Venezia). A peculiar aspect of the work is the figure of Christ (holding the soul of Mary), who doesn’t ascend in a mandorla above the group but stands among the apostles. The mandorla is substituted by small stylised clouds around the figure.\n\nThe theme of depicting the death of the Virgin Mary itself is Byzantine in origin. In Bohemia, the oldest depiction of this kind (the Koímēsis) is a miniature on parchment inserted into the relic panels of a St George reliquary dating from 1306. Later works then gradually abandon the Byzantine scheme, replacing it with the motif of \"Last Prayer of the Virgin Mary\". This was first recorded in the Czech lands from the 1360s.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "205156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205156", "title": "Dysgeusia", "text": "Dysgeusia\n\nDysgeusia, also known as parageusia, is a distortion of the sense of taste. Dysgeusia is also often associated with ageusia, which is the complete lack of taste, and hypogeusia, which is a decrease in taste sensitivity. An alteration in taste or smell may be a secondary process in various disease states, or it may be the primary symptom. The distortion in the sense of taste is the only symptom, and diagnosis is usually complicated since the sense of taste is tied together with other sensory systems. Common causes of dysgeusia include chemotherapy, asthma treatment with albuterol, and zinc deficiency. Different drugs could also be responsible for altering taste and resulting in dysgeusia. Due to the variety of causes of dysgeusia, there are many possible treatments that are effective in alleviating or terminating the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include artificial saliva, pilocarpine, zinc supplementation, alterations in drug therapy, and alpha lipoic acid.\n\nThe alterations in the sense of taste, usually a metallic taste, and sometimes smell are the only symptoms. The duration of the symptoms of dysgeusia depends on the cause. If the alteration in the sense of taste is due to gum disease, dental plaque, a temporary medication, or a short-term condition such as a cold, the dysgeusia should disappear once the cause is removed. In some cases, if lesions are present in the taste pathway and nerves have been damaged, the dysgeusia may be permanent.\n\nA major cause of dysgeusia is chemotherapy for cancer. Chemotherapy often induces damage to the oral cavity, resulting in oral mucositis, oral infection, and salivary gland dysfunction. Oral mucositis consists of inflammation of the mouth, along with sores and ulcers in the tissues. Healthy individuals normally have a diverse range of microbial organisms residing in their oral cavities; however, chemotherapy can permit these typically non-pathogenic agents to cause serious infection, which may result in a decrease in saliva. In addition, patients who undergo radiation therapy also lose salivary tissues. Saliva is an important component of the taste mechanism. Saliva both interacts with and protects the taste receptors in the mouth. Saliva mediates sour and sweet tastes through bicarbonate ions and glutamate, respectively. The salt taste is induced when sodium chloride levels surpass the concentration in the saliva. It has been reported that 50% of chemotherapy patients have suffered from either dysgeusia or another form of taste impairment. Examples of chemotherapy treatments that can lead to dysgeusia are cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and etoposide. The exact mechanism of chemotherapy-induced dysgeusia is unknown.\n\nDistortions in the taste buds may give rise to dysgeusia. In a study conducted by Masahide Yasuda and Hitoshi Tomita from Nihon University of Japan, it has been observed that patients suffering from this taste disorder have fewer microvilli than normal. In addition, the nucleus and cytoplasm of the taste bud cells have been reduced. Based on their findings, dygeusia results from loss of microvilli and the reduction of Type III intracellular vesicles, all of which could potentially interfere with the gustatory pathway. Radiation to head and neck also results in direct destruction of taste buds, apart from effects of altered salivary output.\n\nAnother primary cause of dysgeusia is zinc deficiency. While the exact role of zinc in dysgeusia is unknown, it has been cited that zinc is partly responsible for the repair and production of taste buds. Zinc somehow directly or indirectly interacts with carbonic anhydrase VI, influencing the concentration of gustin, which is linked to the production of taste buds. It has also been reported that patients treated with zinc experience an elevation in calcium concentration in the saliva. In order to work properly, taste buds rely on calcium receptors. Zinc “is an important cofactor for alkaline phosphatase, the most abundant enzyme in taste bud membranes; it is also a component of a parotid salivary protein important to the development and maintenance of normal taste buds.”\n\nThere are also a wide variety of drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, including zopiclone, H-antihistamines, such as azelastine and emedastine. Approximately 250 drugs affect taste. The sodium channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by amiloride, and the creation of new taste buds and saliva can be impeded by antiproliferative drugs. Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include lithium carbonate and tetracyclines. Drugs containing sulfhydryl groups, including penicillamine and captopril, may react with zinc and cause deficiency. Metronidazole and chlorhexidine have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the cell membrane. Drugs that prevent the production of angiotensin II by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme, eprosartan for example, have been linked to dysgeusia. There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine also cause dysguesia by blocking calcium sensitive taste buds.\n\nXerostomia, also known as dry mouth syndrome, can precipitate dysgeusia because normal salivary flow and concentration are necessary for taste. Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve can result in dysgeusia. In addition, damage done to the pons, thalamus, and midbrain, all of which compose the gustatory pathway, can be potential factors. In a case study, 22% of patients who were experiencing a bladder obstruction were also suffering from dysgeusia. Dysgeusia was eliminated in 100% of these patients once the obstruction was removed. Although it is uncertain what the relationship between bladder relief and dysgeusia entails, it has been observed that the areas responsible for urinary system and taste in the pons and cerebral cortex in the brain are close in proximity.\n\nMany of the causes for dysgeusia occur due to unknown reasons. A wide range of miscellaneous factors may contribute to this taste disorder, such as gastric reflux, lead poisoning, and diabetes mellitus. A minority of pine nuts can apparently cause taste disturbances, for reasons which are not entirely proven. Certain pesticides can have damaging effects on the taste buds and nerves in the mouth. These pesticides include organochloride compounds and carbamate pesticides. Damage to the peripheral nerves, along with injury to the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, also cause dysgeusia. A surgical risk for laryngoscopy and tonsillectomy include dysgeusia. Patients who suffer from the burning mouth syndrome, most likely menopausal women, are often suffering from dysgeusia as well.\n\nThe sense of taste is based on the detection of chemicals by specialized taste cells in the mouth. The mouth, throat, larynx, and esophagus all have taste buds, which are replaced every ten days. Each taste bud contains receptor cells. Afferent nerves make contact with the receptor cells at the base of the taste bud. A single taste bud is innervated by several afferent nerves, while a single efferent fiber innervates several taste buds. Fungiform papillae are present on the anterior portion of the tongue while circumvallate papillae and foliate papillae are found on the posterior portion of the tongue. The salivary glands are responsible for keeping the taste buds moist with saliva.\n\nA single taste bud is composed of four different types of cells, and each taste bud has at least 30 to 80 cells. Type I cells are thinly shaped, usually in the periphery of other cells. They also contain high amounts of chromatin. Type II cells have prominent nuclei and nucleoli with much less chromatin than Type I cells. Type III cells have multiple mitochondria and large vesicles. Type I, II, and III cells also contain synapses. Type IV cells are normally rooted at the posterior end of the taste bud. Every cell in the taste bud forms microvilli at the ends.\nIn humans, the sense of taste is conveyed via three of the twelve cranial nerves. The chorda tympani is responsible for taste sensations from the anterior two thirds of the tongue, the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) is responsible for taste sensations from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the vagus nerve (X) carries some taste sensations from the back of the oral cavity.\n\nIn general, gustatory disorders are challenging to diagnose and evaluate. Because gustatory functions are tied to the sense of smell, the somatosensory system, and the perception of pain (such as in tasting spicy foods), it is difficult to examine sensations mediated through an individual system. In addition, gustatory dysfunction is rare when compared to olfactory disorders.\n\nDiagnosis of dysgeusia begins with the patient being questioned about salivation, swallowing, chewing, oral pain, previous ear infections (possibly indicated by hearing or balance problems), oral hygiene, and stomach problems. The initial history assessment also considers the possibility of accompanying diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, or cancer. A clinical examination is conducted and includes an inspection of the tongue and the oral cavity. Furthermore, the ear canal is inspected, as lesions of the chorda tympani have a predilection for this site.\n\nIn order to further classify the extent of dysgeusia and clinically measure the sense of taste, gustatory testing may be performed. Gustatory testing is performed either as a whole-mouth procedure or as a regional test. In both techniques, natural or electrical stimuli can be used. In regional testing, 20 to 50 µL of liquid stimulus is presented to the anterior and posterior tongue using a pipette, soaked filter-paper disks, or cotton swabs. In whole mouth testing, small quantities (2-10 mL) of solution are administered, and the patient is asked to swish the solution around in the mouth.\n\nThreshold tests for sucrose (sweet), citric acid (sour), sodium chloride (salty), and quinine or caffeine (bitter) are frequently performed with natural stimuli. One of the most frequently used techniques is the \"three-drop test.\" In this test, three drops of liquid are presented to the subject. One of the drops is of the taste stimulus, and the other two drops are pure water. Threshold is defined as the concentration at which the patient identifies the taste correctly three times in a row.\n\nSuprathreshold tests, which provide intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, are used to assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour). Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked to rate the intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another sensory system, such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale. For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000 Hz tones. Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct scaling method, some tests do use the magnitude-matching procedure.\n\nOther tests include identification or discrimination of common taste substances. Topical anesthesia of the tongue has been reported to be of use in the diagnosis of dysgeusia as well, since it has been shown to relieve the symptoms of dysgeusia temporarily. In addition to techniques based on the administration of chemicals to the tongue, electrogustometry is frequently used. It is based on the induction of gustatory sensations by means of an anodal electrical direct current. Patients usually report sour or metallic sensations similar to those associated with touching both poles of a live battery to the tongue. Although electrogustometry is widely used, there seems to be a poor correlation between electrically and chemically induced sensations.\n\nCertain diagnostic tools can also be used to help determine the extent of dysgeusia. Electrophysiological tests and simple reflex tests may be applied to identify abnormalities in the nerve-to-brainstem pathways. For example, the blink reflex may be used to evaluate the integrity of the trigeminal nerve–pontine brainstem–facial nerve pathway, which may play a role in gustatory function.\n\nStructural imaging is routinely used to investigate lesions in the taste pathway. Magnetic resonance imaging allows direct visualization of the cranial nerves. Furthermore, it provides significant information about the type and cause of a lesion. Analysis of mucosal blood flow in the oral cavity in combination with the assessment of autonomous cardiovascular factors appears to be useful in the diagnosis of autonomic nervous system disorders in burning mouth syndrome and in patients with inborn disorders, both of which are associated with gustatory dysfunction. Cell cultures may also be used when fungal or bacterial infections are suspected.\n\nIn addition, the analysis of saliva should be performed, as it constitutes the environment of taste receptors, including transport of tastes to the receptor and protection of the taste receptor. Typical clinical investigations involve sialometry and sialochemistry. Studies have shown that electron micrographs of taste receptors obtained from saliva samples indicate pathological changes in the taste buds of patients with dysgeusia and other gustatory disorders.\n\nBecause medications have been linked to approximately 22% to 28% of all cases of dysgeusia, researching a treatment for this particular cause has been important. Xerostomia, or a decrease in saliva flow, can be a side effect of many drugs, which, in turn, can lead to the development of taste disturbances such as dysgeusia. Patients can lessen the effects of xerostomia with breath mints, sugarless gum, or lozenges, or physicians can increase saliva flow with artificial saliva or oral pilocarpine. Artificial saliva mimics the characteristics of natural saliva by lubricating and protecting the mouth but does not provide any digestive or enzymatic benefits. Pilocarpine is a cholinergic drug meaning it has the same effects as the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine has the function of stimulating the salivary glands to actively produce saliva. The increase in saliva flow is effective in improving the movement of tastants to the taste buds.\n\nApproximately one half of drug-related taste distortions are caused by a zinc deficiency. Many medications are known to chelate, or bind, zinc, preventing the element from functioning properly. Due to the causal relationship of insufficient zinc levels to taste disorders, research has been conducted to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation as a possible treatment for dysgeusia. In a randomized clinical trial, fifty patients suffering from idiopathic dysgeusia were given either zinc or a lactose placebo. The patients prescribed the zinc reported experiencing improved taste function and less severe symptoms compared to the control group, suggesting that zinc may be a beneficial treatment. The efficacy of zinc, however, has been ambiguous in the past. In a second study, 94% of patients who were provided with zinc supplementation did not experience any improvement in their condition. This ambiguity is most likely due to small sample sizes and the wide range of causes of dysgeusia. A recommended daily oral dose of 25–100 mg appears to be an effective treatment for taste dysfunction provided that there are low levels of zinc in the blood serum. There is not a sufficient amount of evidence to determine whether or not zinc supplementation is able to treat dysgeusia when low zinc concentrations are not detected in the blood.\n\nIt has been reported that approximately 68% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy experience disturbances in sensory perception such as dysgeusia. In a pilot study involving twelve lung cancer patients, chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment. The results indicated that, after two weeks, no taste disturbances were reported by the patients who received the zinc-supplemented treatment while most of the patients in the control group who did not receive the zinc reported taste alterations. A multi-institutional study involving a larger sample size of 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not have an effect on the development of taste disorders in cancer patients. An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the immune system, and physicians must use caution when administering zinc to immunocompromised cancer patients. Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient's quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.\n\nThe effects of drug-related dysgeusia can often be reversed by stopping the patient's regimen of the taste altering medication. In one case, a forty-eight-year-old woman who was suffering from hypertension was being treated with valsartan. Due to this drug's inability to treat her condition, she began taking a regimen of eprosartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Within three weeks, she began experiencing a metallic taste and a burning sensation in her mouth that ceased when she stopped taking the medication. When she began taking eprosartan on a second occasion, her dysgeusia returned. In a second case, a fifty-nine-year-old man was prescribed amlodipine in order to treat his hypertension. After eight years of taking the drug, he developed a loss of taste sensation and numbness in his tongue. When he ran out of his medication, he decided not to obtain a refill and stopped taking amlodipine. Following this self-removal, he reported experiencing a return of his taste sensation. Once he refilled his prescription and began taking amlodipine a second time, his taste disturbance reoccurred. These two cases suggest that there is an association between these drugs and taste disorders. This link is supported by the \"de-challenge\" and \"re-challenge\" that took place in both instances. It appears that drug-induced dysgeusia can be alleviated by reducing the drug's dose or by substituting a second drug from the same class.\n\nAlpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant that is made naturally by human cells. It can also be administered in capsules or can be found in foods such as red meat, organ meats, and yeast. Like other antioxidants, it functions by ridding the body of harmful free radicals that can cause damage to tissues and organs. It has an important role in the Krebs cycle as a coenzyme leading to the production of antioxidants, intracellular glutathione, and nerve-growth factors. Animal research has also uncovered the ability of ALA to improve nerve conduction velocity. Because flavors are perceived by differences in electric potential through specific nerves innervating the tongue, idiopathic dysgeusia may be a form of a neuropathy. ALA has proven to be an effective treatment for burning mouth syndrome spurring studies in its potential to treat dysgeusia. In a study of forty-four patients diagnosed with the disorder, one half was treated with the drug for two months while the other half, the control group, was given a placebo for two months followed by a two-month treatment of ALA. The results reported show that 91% of the group initially treated with ALA reported an improvement in their condition compared to only 36% of the control group. After the control group was treated with ALA, 72% reported an improvement. This study suggests that ALA may be a potential treatment for patients and supports that full double blind randomized studies should be performed.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned treatments, there are also many management approaches that can alleviate the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include using non-metallic silverware, avoiding metallic or bitter tasting foods, increasing the consumption of foods high in protein, flavoring foods with spices and seasonings, serving foods cold in order to reduce any unpleasant taste or odor, frequently brushing one's teeth and utilizing mouthwash, or using sialogogues such as chewing sugar-free gum or sour-tasting drops that stimulate the productivity of saliva. When taste is impeded, the food experience can be improved through means other than taste, such as texture, aroma, temperature, and color.\n\nPeople who suffer from dysgeusia are also forced to manage the impact that the disorder has on their quality of life. An altered taste has effects on food choice and intake and can lead to weight loss, malnutrition, impaired immunity, and a decline in health. Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must use caution when adding sugar and salt to food and must be sure not to overcompensate for their lack of taste with excess amounts. Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances increasing the chances of developing depression, loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss. This is cause for an evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult. Other problems that may arise include anorexia and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food. Symptoms including paranoia, amnesia, cerebellar malfunction, and lethargy can also manifest when undergoing histidine treatment. This makes it critical that these patients' dysgeusia is either treated or managed in order to improve their quality of life.\n\nEvery year, more than 200,000 individuals see their physicians concerning chemosensory problems, and many more taste disturbances are never reported. Due to the large number of persons affected by taste disorders, basic and clinical research are receiving support at different institutions and chemosensory research centers across the country. These taste and smell clinics are focusing their research on better understanding the mechanisms involved in gustatory function and taste disorders such as dysgeusia. For example, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders is looking into the mechanisms underlying the key receptors on taste cells and applying this knowledge to the future of medications and artificial food products. Meanwhile, the Taste and Smell Clinic at the University of Connecticut Health Center is integrating behavioral, neurophysiological, and genetic studies involving stimulus concentrations and intensities in order to better understand taste function. The purpose of these studies is to unearth the biological mechanisms underlying taste and to use this data to eliminate taste disorders in order to improve the lives of taste disorder sufferers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24621", "title": "En plein air", "text": "En plein air\n\nEn plein air (, French for outdoors, or plein air painting) is the act of painting outdoors. This method contrasts with studio painting or academic rules that might create a predetermined look.\n\nArtists have long painted outdoors, but in the mid-19th century, working in natural light became particularly important to the Barbizon school, Hudson River School, and Impressionists.\n\nIn 1830, the Barbizon School in France, inspired by John Constable, enabled artists like Charles-François Daubigny and Théodore Rousseau to more accurately depict the appearance of outdoor settings in various light and weather conditions. In the late 1800s, the en plein air approach was incorporated with the impressionists’ style, and artists such as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Frédéric Bazille, and Edgar Degas began creating their work outdoors. From France, the movement expanded to America, starting in California then moving to other American locales notable for their natural light qualities, including the Hudson River Valley in New York.\n\nThe Macchiaioli were a group of Italian painters active in Tuscany in the second half of the nineteenth century, who, breaking with the antiquated conventions taught by the Italian academies of art, did much of their painting outdoors in order to capture natural light, shade, and colour. This practice relates the Macchiaioli to the French Impressionists who came to prominence a few years later, although the Macchiaioli pursued somewhat different purposes. Their movement began in Florence in the late 1850s.\n\nThe Newlyn School in England is considered another major proponent of the technique in the latter 19th century. The popularity of painting \"en plein air\" increased in the 1840s with the introduction of paints in tubes (like those for toothpaste). Previously, painters made their own paints by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil.\n\nThe act of outdoor painting from observation has been continually popular well into the 21st century.\n\nIt was during the mid-19th century that the \"box easel\", typically known as the \"French box easel\" or \"field easel\", was invented. It is uncertain who developed it, but these highly portable easels with telescopic legs and built-in paint box and palette made it easier to go into the forest and up the hillsides. Still made today, they remain a popular choice (even for home use) since they fold up to the size of a brief case and thus are easy to store.\n\nThe Pochade Box is a compact box that allows the artist to keep all their supplies and palette within the box and have the work on the inside of the lid. Some designs allow for a larger canvas which can be held by clamps built into the lid. There are designs which can also hold a few wet painting canvases or panels within the lid. These boxes have a rising popularity as while they are mainly used for plein air painting, can also be used in the studio, home, or classroom. Since pochade boxes are mainly used for painting on location, the canvas or work surface may be small, usually not more than 20 inches (50 cm).\n\nChallenges include the type of paint used to paint outdoors, animals, bugs, onlookers, and environmental conditions such as weather. Acrylic paint may harden and dry quickly in warm, sunny weather and it cannot be reused. On the opposite side of the spectrum is the challenge of painting in moist or damp conditions with precipitation. The advent of plein air painting predated the invention of acrylics. The traditional and well-established method of painting \"en plein air\" incorporates the use of oil paint.\n\nFrench impressionist painters such as Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir advocated plein air painting, and much of their work was done outdoors in the diffuse light of a large white umbrella. Claude Monet was an avid en plein air artist who deduced that to seize the closeness and likeness of an outside setting at a specific moment one had to be outside to do so rather than just paint an outside setting in their studio. In the second half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century in Russia, painters such as Vasily Polenov, Isaac Levitan, Valentin Serov, Konstantin Korovin and I. E. Grabar were known for painting \"en plein air\".\n\nBut enthusiasts of plein air painting were not limited to the Old World. American impressionists too, such as those of the Old Lyme school, were avid painters \"en plein air\". American impressionist painters noted for this style during this era included Guy Rose, Robert William Wood, Mary DeNeale Morgan, John Gamble, and Arthur Hill Gilbert. In Canada, the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson are examples of \"en plein air\" advocates.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12537650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12537650", "title": "Faux painting", "text": "Faux painting\n\nFaux painting or faux finishing are terms used to describe decorative paint finishes that replicate the appearance of materials such as marble, wood or stone. The term comes from the French word faux, meaning false, as these techniques started as a form of replicating materials such as marble and wood with paint, but has subsequently come to encompass many other decorative finishes for walls and furniture including simulating recognisable textures and surfaces.\n\nFaux finishing has been used for millennia, from cave painting to the tombs of ancient Egypt, but what we generally think of as faux finishing in the decorative arts began with plaster and stucco finishes in Mesopotamia over 5,000 years ago.\n\nFaux painting became popular in classical times in the forms of faux marble, faux wood, and trompe l'oeil murals. Artists would apprentice for 10 years or more with a master faux painter before working on their own. Great recognition was awarded to artists who could actually trick viewers into believing their work was the real thing. Faux painting has continued to be popular throughout the ages, but experienced major resurgences in the neoclassical revival of the nineteenth century and the Art Deco styles of the 1920s. During the recent history of decorative painting, faux finishing has been mainly used in commercial and public spaces.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, faux finishing saw another major revival, as wallpaper began to fall out of fashion. At this point, faux painting became extremely popular in home environments, with high-end homes leading the trend. While it can be quite expensive to hire a professional faux finisher($80.00/hr.), many faux painting methods are thought to be simple enough for a beginning home owner to create with a little instruction. Some, however, fail to take important details like corners into consideration and end up with a do-it-yourself looking job. Some professionally applied finishes in the high-end, Bay-Area homes of northern California, for example, were as simple as oil glaze/oil-based paint/penetrol or as complicated as applications with peacock feathers and 4 different colors applied using 4 different techniques. People are attracted to the simplicity of changing a faux finish, because it can be easily painted over compared with the trouble of removing wallpaper. Trouble with removing wallpaper comes when people who have no formal training don't follow proper procedures during preparation such as priming with an oil-based primer, then following that with another product which makes the paper come off relatively easy.\n\nIn modern-day faux finishing, there are two major materials/processes used. Glaze work involves using a translucent mixture of paint and glaze applied with a brush, roller, rag, or sponge, and often mimics textures, but it is always smooth to the touch. Plaster work can be done with tinted plasters, or washed over with earth pigments, and is generally applied with a trowel or spatula. The finished result can be either flat to the touch or textured.\n\n"}

The designs differ from the older stylised and pious neo-Gothic jewellery, in that they are extravagantly opulent - this richness of form and colour which had appealed to the Tudor court was rediscovered by Victorian jewellers and their patrons, reviving a fashion that flourished into the early 1900s. \n\nThe style is characterised by a large, centrally-placed cabochon gemstone, cameo or intaglio mounted in gold and colourful enamel work, such as basse-taille, champlevé, cloisonné and en ronde bosse. Beneath this, a drop-shaped pearl or diamond-set lozenge was suspended. The back of each piece is often elaborately engraved using scroll and foliate ornamentation. Such designs were inspired by the art of Hans Holbein the Younger, and were often copied from jewellery depicted in Holbein's portraits of Tudor ladies from the court of Henry VIII by jewellers such as John Brogden and his fellow worker, Carlo Giuliano. Other jewellery houses producing Holbeinesque pieces, were those of Jules Wièse, Boucheron, Chaumet and Vever. Besides paintings of his sitters wearing their jewellery, Holbein also left detailed drawings of pieces, some copied from his sitters' pieces, some of his own design.\n\nThe motifs used came from classical mythology or from 16th-century Mannerist ornamentation, involving hybrid human/animal forms known as grotesques, torsos ending in columns or pedestals called terms, and chimeras. Putti, quatrefoil and fantastic masks were often used for embellishment.\n\nHolbeinesque jewellers could avail themselves of a vast range of reference sources for their designs. Many jewellery items survived from the Renaissance, books on design by artists of the 15th and 16th centuries, and court portraits of the rich and influential figures of the period by artists such as Raphael, Holbein and Cranach.\n"}
{"id": "193303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193303", "title": "Ira Hayes", "text": "Ira Hayes\n\nIra Hamilton Hayes (January 12, 1923 – January 24, 1955) was a Pima Native American and a United States Marine who was one of the six flag raisers immortalized in the iconic photograph of the flag raising on Iwo Jima during World War II. Hayes was an enrolled member of the Gila River Pima Indian Reservation located in the Pinal and Maricopa counties in Arizona. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve on August 26, 1942 and, after recruit training, volunteered to become a Paramarine. He fought in the Bougainville and Iwo Jima campaigns in the Pacific Theatre of Operations.\n\nOn February 23, 1945, he helped to raise an American flag over Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima, an event photographed by Joe Rosenthal of the Associated Press. Hayes and the other five flag-raisers became national heroes as a result. In 1946, he was instrumental in revealing the true identity of one of the other pictured Marines, who was killed in action on Iwo Jima. However, Hayes was never comfortable with his fame, and after his service in the Marine Corps, he descended into alcoholism. He died of exposure to cold and alcohol poisoning after a night of drinking on January 23–24, 1955. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on February 2, 1955.\n\nHayes was often commemorated in art and film, before and after his death. In 1949, he portrayed himself raising the flag in the motion picture movie, \"Sands of Iwo Jima\". A giant Marine figure of Hayes raising the flag on Iwo Jima with the other five participants is included on the 1954 Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nHe was the subject of an article by journalist William Bradford Huie, which was adapted for the feature film \"The Outsider\" (1961), starring Tony Curtis as Hayes. The movie inspired songwriter Peter La Farge to write \"The Ballad of Ira Hayes,\" which became popular nationwide in 1964 after being recorded by Johnny Cash. In 2006, Hayes was portrayed by Adam Beach in the World War II movie \"Flags of Our Fathers,\" directed by Clint Eastwood.\n\nIra Hayes was born in Sacaton, Arizona, a town in the Gila River Indian Community in Pinal County. He was the eldest of six children born to Nancy Hamilton (1901–1972) and Joseph Hayes (1887–1978). The Hayes children were: Ira (1923–1955), Harold (1924–1925), Arlene (1926–1929), Leonard (1927–1952), Vernon (1929–1958), and Kenneth (born 1931). Joseph Hayes was a World War I veteran who supported his family by subsistence farming and its cotton harvesting. Nancy Hayes was a devout Presbyterian and a Sunday school teacher at the Assemblies of God church in Sacaton.\n\nIra was remembered by his family and friends as being a shy and sensitive child. Sara Bernal, his first cousin, said, \"Joseph Hayes was a very quiet man; he would go days without saying anything unless you spoke to him first. The other Hayes children would play and tease me, but not Ira. He was quiet, and somewhat distant. Ira didn't speak unless spoken to. He was just like his father.\" His boyhood friend Dana Norris said, \"Even though I'm from the same culture, I could never get under his skin. Ira had the characteristic of not wanting to talk. But we Pimas are not prone to tooting our own horns. Ira was a quiet guy, such a quiet guy.\" Despite this, Hayes was a precocious child who displayed an impressive grasp of the English language, a language that many Pima never learned to speak. He learned to read and write by the age of four and was a voracious reader.\n\nIn 1932, the family settled in Bapchule, Arizona, approximately 12 miles northwest of Sacaton. The Hayes children attended grade school in Sacaton and high school at the Phoenix Indian School in Phoenix, Arizona. Hayes confided to his classmate Eleanor Pasquale after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, that he was determined to serve in the United States Marine Corps. Pasquale said, \"Every morning in school, [the students] would get a report on World War II. We would sing the anthems of the Army, Marines, and the Navy.\" Hayes completed two years at the Phoenix Indian School and served in the Civilian Conservation Corps in May and June 1942. He worked as a carpenter before enlisting in the service.\n\nHayes enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve on August 26, 1942. He completed recruit training in Platoon 701 at Marine Corps Base, San Diego (renamed in 1948, Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego) and in October volunteered for Marine paratrooper (Paramarine) training at the Marine Parachute School at Camp Gillespie located east of San Diego. He received the codename of \"Chief Falling Cloud\". On November 30, he graduated from the Parachute Training School and received his silver \"jump wings\". On December 1, he was promoted to Private First Class.\n\nOn December 2, 1942, he joined Company B, 3rd Parachute Battalion, Divisional Special Troops, 3rd Marine Division, at Camp Elliott, California. On March 14, 1943, Hayes sailed for New Caledonia with the 3rd Parachute Battalion, which was assigned to Camp Kiser there on March 25 until September 26; the unit was redesignated in April as Company K, 3rd Parachute Battalion, 1st Marine Parachute Regiment of the I Marine Amphibious Corps. The 3rd battalion was shipped to Guadalcanal and remained there until it was sent to Vella Lavella, arriving on October 14 for occupational duty. On December 4, Hayes landed with the 3rd battalion on Bougainville and fought against the Japanese as a platoon automatic rifleman (BAR man) with Company K during the Bougainville Campaign. The 3rd Parachute Battalion was shipped back to Guadalcanal, and he stayed there until sometime in February when the Paramarines were sent back to California. The 1st Parachute Regiment was officially disbanded at Camp Pendleton, California, in February 1944.\n\nHayes was transferred to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment of the newly activated 5th Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. Hayes sailed to Hawaii with his company in September for continued training with the 5th division as it trained for the invasion and capture of Iwo Jima.\n\nThe 5th Marine Division landed on Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945. Hayes's Second Platoon, Easy Company, 2/28 Marines, landed on the southern beach near Mount Suribachi off of the USS Talladega after transferring from the USS Missoula. On February 23, Marines from the Third Platoon of Easy Company, 2/28 Marines, captured and raised an American flag on top of Mount Suribachi at approximately 10:30 a.m.\n\nIn the early afternoon, Hayes's squad leader, Sergeant Michael Strank, was ordered to take three Marines from his rifle squad in Second Platoon, Easy Company, to bring supplies up Mount Suribachi and raise a larger flag on the summit. Strank chose Corporal Harlon Block, Private First Class Franklin Sousley, and Hayes for the patrol. Marine Private First Class Rene Gagnon, a battalion runner for Easy Company, was ordered up the mountain with the replacement flag. The four Marines together with Gagnon and Private First Class Harold Schultz (Navy corpsman John Bradley was misidentified as a flag-raiser until June 23, 2016), raised the second flag attached onto another steel pipe found by Hayes and Sousley, while at the same time the smaller flag came down. Schultz from Third Platoon, was part of the original 40-man patrol that climbed up Mount Suribachi.\n\nOn March 14, another American flag was officially raised at Marine headquarters at the base of Mount Suribachi to signal the Marine occupied Iwo Jima, and the flag on top of Mount Suribachi that Hayes helped to raise there was taken down. Hayes fought on the island until it was secure on March 26, and left Iwo Jima with his unit on March 27. Easy Company had many casualties, Hayes was one of five Marines remaining from his platoon of forty-five men including their corpsmen.\n\nThe raising of the second American flag on Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945 was immortalized by AP photographer Joe Rosenthal and became an icon of the world war. Soon afterwards, the two surviving flag-raisers Hayes and Gagnon, and Bradley who was believed to be in Rosenthal's photograph, became national heroes. Harlon Block who was killed in action on Iwo Jima in March 1945, was misidentified as being Sergeant Henry Hansen from Third Platoon, Easy Company who was also killed in action. Hayes had attempted to correct the misrepresentation of his friend Block for Hansen (Hansen helped raise the first flag) in April 1945, but was silenced by a Marine Corps officer in Washington, D.C. who was placed in charge of the flag-raisers.\n\nHayes and his unit left Iwo Jima on the USS Winged Arrow bound for Hawaii on March 27, 1945. Hayes continued to train at Camp Tarawa again with his unit until April 15, 1945, when he boarded a plane to Washington, D.C. with orders to join C Company, 1st Headquarters Battalion, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, Washington, D.C. with the two other surviving second flag-raisers. President Franklin Roosevelt paid for the war by selling war bonds and had requested the flag raisers (in Joe Rosenthal's photograph) participation before he died on April 12. Hayes and Gagnon, and Bradley, were assigned to making public appearances in connection with selling government war bonds for the Seventh War Loan Drive. On April 20, the three met with President Harry Truman at the White House. The bond tour began on May 11 in New York City, after Hayes, Gagnon, and Bradley raised the same flag that was raised on Mount Suribachi, at the Nation's capital during a ceremony at the Capitol steps on May 9. Hayes was in charge of the flag. The bond tour ended on July 4 in Washington, D.C. Hayes however, finished his participation in the bond drive on May 24 in Indianapolis, Indiana and returned to Washington, D.C. with orders to rejoin E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines at Camp Tarawa in Hawaii. He arrived at Hilo, Hawaii by plane and rejoined E Company on May 29.\n\nOn June 19, Hayes was promoted to corporal. He served on occupation duty in Japan with E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines from September 22 to October 26, 1945. He was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California on December 1, 1945. On February 21, 1946, he was awarded a Navy Commendation from the Marine Corps for meritorious service in combat during World War II.\n\nHayes attempted to lead a normal civilian life after the war. \"I kept getting hundreds of letters. And people would drive through the reservation, walk up to me and ask, \"Are you the Indian who raised the flag on Iwo Jima?\" \nAlthough Hayes rarely spoke about the flag raising, he talked more generally about his service in the Marine Corps with great pride.\n\nHayes seemed to be disturbed that Harlon Block was still being misrepresented publicly as \"Hank\" Hansen. One day in 1946, Hayes walked and hitchhiked 1,300 miles from the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona to Edward Frederick Block, Sr.'s farm in Weslaco, Texas, to reveal the truth to Block's family about their son Harlon being in the Rosenthal photograph. He was instrumental in having the mistaken second flag-raiser controversy resolved by the Marine Corps in January 1947. Block's family was grateful to Hayes, especially Harlon's mother. She said that she had known from the time she first saw the photo in the newspaper, that it was Harlon in the photo. Mrs. Block took what Hayes said and wrote to her congressman.\nIn 1949, Hayes appeared briefly as himself in the film \"Sands of Iwo Jima,\" starring John Wayne. In the movie, Wayne handed the American flag to Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley, who at the time were considered the three surviving second flag-raisers (the second flag that was raised on Mount Suribachi is used in the film and is handed directly to Gagnon).\n\nAfter this Hayes was unable to hold on to a steady job for a long period, as he had become alcoholic. He was arrested 52 times for alcohol intoxication in public at various places in the country, including Chicago in October 1953. Referring to his alcoholism, he once said: \"I was sick. I guess I was about to crack up thinking about all my good buddies. They were better men than me and they're not coming back. Much less back to the White House, like me.\" Hayes was sober while attending the Marine Corps War Memorial dedication on November 10, 1954 where he was lauded by President Dwight D. Eisenhower as a hero. A reporter there approached Hayes and asked him, \"How do you like the pomp and circumstance?\" Hayes hung his head and said, \"I don't.\"\n\nHis disquiet about his unwanted fame and his subsequent post-war problems were first recounted in detail by the author William Bradford Huie in \"The Outsider,\" published in 1959 as part of his collection \"Wolf Whistle and Other Stories\". \"The Outsider\" was filmed in 1961, was directed by World War II veteran turned film director Delbert Mann and starred Tony Curtis as Hayes. The 2006 film \"Flags of Our Fathers\", directed by Clint Eastwood, suggests that Hayes suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nOn the morning of January 24, 1955, Hayes was found dead lying near an abandoned adobe hut near where he lived in Sacaton, Arizona. He had been drinking and playing cards on the reservation with his friends and brothers Vernon and Kenneth. An altercation ensued between Hayes and a Pima Indian named Henry Setoyant, and all left except Hayes and Setoyant. The Pinal County coroner concluded that Hayes's death was caused by exposure and alcohol poisoning. However, his brother Kenneth, a Korean War veteran, believes that the death resulted from the altercation with Setoyant. The reservation police did not conduct an investigation into Hayes's death, and Setoyant denied any allegations of fighting with Hayes. There was no autopsy.\n\nIn the film, \"The Outsider,\" his death is dramatized for the screen. He is shown drunk and freezing on a mountain top and unable to climb down. He falls asleep and is shown frozen to death with his arm and hand reaching upwards, like the time he raised the flag on Mount Suribachi. In the song \"The Ballad of Ira Hayes,\" his death is described as dying an indigent death: being drunk and drowning in two inches of water in a ditch.\n\nOn February 2, 1955, Hayes was buried in Section 34, Grave 479A at Arlington National Cemetery. At the funeral, fellow flag-raiser Rene Gagnon said of him: \"Let's say he had a little dream in his heart that someday the Indian would be like the white man — be able to walk all over the United States.\"\nOn November 10, 1993, the United States Marine Corps held a ceremony at the Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Memorial) commemorating the 218th anniversary of the Marine Corps. Of Ira Hayes, USMC Commandant General Carl Mundy said:\n\nHayes' Navy Commendation Ribbon was updated to the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Combat \"V\" for meritorious service. He rates the Navy Combat Action Ribbon for combat participation in World War II. The \" silver star on his Navy Presidential Unit Citation ribbon was a Marine Corps, World War II, campaign participation star (discontinued) for Iwo Jima, not a 2nd Presidential Unit Citation award (\" bronze star). Hayes' 39 months of service did not meet the Marine Corps four-year (48 months) service requirement in World War II for the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal.\n\nHayes' military decorations and awards:\n\nHayes's story was immortalized in a song, \"The Ballad of Ira Hayes\", by Peter LaFarge. Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, Smiley Bates, Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Kinky Friedman, Tom Russell, Hazel Dickens, Patrick Sky and Townes Van Zandt each covered the song. In 1964, Cash took the song to number 3 on the Billboard country music chart.\n\nIra Hayes appeared as himself in the 1949 John Wayne film, \"Sands of Iwo Jima\". In the 1960 telefilm \"The American\", he was played by World War II Marine veteran Lee Marvin. Tony Curtis played Hayes in the 1961 film \"The Outsider\". Hayes was portrayed by Adam Beach in the 2006 movie \"Flags of Our Fathers\", directed by Clint Eastwood. The movie was based on the 2000 bestselling book of the same name by James Bradley and Ron Powers.\n\nThe poet Ai dedicates her poem \"I Can't Get Started\" to Hayes. Hayes is mentioned in the poem \"Petroglyphs of Serena\" by Adrian C. Louis. He was also mentioned briefly in the book \"Code Talker\" by Joseph Bruchac and was mentioned multiple times in the book \"Indian Killer\" by Sherman Alexie.\n\nIra Hayes' personal honors include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The book was released on April 18, 2017 by Doubleday.\n\n\"Time\" magazine listed \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" as one of its top ten non-fiction books of 2017.\n\nThe book investigates a series of murders of wealthy Osage people that took place in Osage County, Oklahoma in the early 1920s—after big oil deposits were discovered beneath their land. Officially, the count of the murdered full-blood wealthy Osage native Americans reaches at least 20, but Grann suspects that hundreds more may have been killed because of their ties to oil. The book reports cattleman William Hale as the mastermind standing behind the murders and presents detailed evidence.\n\nImperative Entertainment is said to pay $5 million for the rights to adapt the book to film with Eric Roth set to write the screenplay. As of July 14, 2017, Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio are developing a film adaptation of the book. Filming is expected to start in spring 2019.

{"id": "662134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=662134", "title": "Letterpress printing", "text": "Letterpress printing\n\nLetterpress printing is a technique of relief printing using a printing press, a process by which many copies are produced by repeated direct impression of an inked, raised surface against sheets or a continuous roll of paper. A worker composes and locks movable type into the \"bed\" or \"chase\" of a press, inks it, and presses paper against it to transfer the ink from the type which creates an impression on the paper.\n\nIn practice, letterpress also includes other forms of relief printing with printing presses, such as wood engravings, photo-etched zinc \"cuts\" (plates), and linoleum blocks, which can be used alongside metal type, or wood type, in a single operation, as well as stereotypes and electrotypes of type and blocks. With certain letterpress units it is also possible to join movable type with slugs cast using hot metal typesetting. In theory, anything that is \"type high\" or .918 inches can be printed using letterpress.\n\nLetterpress printing was the normal form of printing text from its invention by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century until the 19th century and remained in wide use for books and other uses until the second half of the 20th century. Letterpress printing remained the primary way to print and distribute information until the 20th century, when offset printing was developed, which largely supplanted its role in printing books and newspapers. All forms of data collection were affected by the invention of letterpress printing, as were many careers such as teachers, preachers, physicians and surgeons and artist-engineers. More recently, letterpress printing has seen a revival in an artisanal form.\n\nJohannes Gutenberg is credited with the development in the western hemisphere, in about 1440, of modern movable type printing from individually cast, reusable letters set together in a form (frame or chase). Movable type was first invented in China using ceramic type in 1040 AD. Gutenberg also invented a wooden printing press, based on the extant wine press, where the type surface was inked with leather-covered ink balls and paper laid carefully on top by hand, then slid under a padded surface and pressure applied from above by a large threaded screw. It was Gutenberg's \"screw press\" or hand press that was used to print 180 copies of the Bible. At 1,282 pages, it took him and his staff of 20 almost 3 years to complete. 48 copies remain intact today. This form of presswork gradually replaced the hand-copied manuscripts of scribes and illuminators as the most prevalent form of printing. Printers' workshops, previously unknown in Europe before the mid-15th century, were found in every important metropolis by 1500. Later metal presses used a knuckle and lever arrangement instead of the screw, but the principle was the same. Ink rollers made of composition made inking faster and paved the way for further automation.\n\nWith the advent of industrial mechanisation, inking was carried out by rollers that passed over the face of the type, then moved out of the way onto an ink plate to pick up a fresh film of ink for the next sheet. Meanwhile, a sheet of paper slid against a hinged platen (see image), which then rapidly pressed onto the type and swung back again as the sheet was removed and the next sheet inserted. As the fresh sheet of paper replaced the printed paper, the now freshly inked rollers ran over the type again. Fully automated 20th-century presses, such as the Kluge and \"Original\" Heidelberg Platen (the \"Windmill\"), incorporated pneumatic sheet feed and delivery.\n\nRotary presses were used for high-speed work. In the oscillating press, the form slid under a drum around which each sheet of paper got wrapped for the impression, sliding back under the inking rollers while the paper was removed and a new sheet inserted. In a newspaper press, a papier-mâché mixture called a flong used to make a mould of the entire form of type, then dried and bent, and a curved metal stereotype plate cast against it. The plates were clipped to a rotating drum and could print against a continuous reel of paper at the enormously high speeds required for overnight newspaper production.\nThis invention helped aid the high demand for knowledge during this time period.\n\nLetterpress printing was introduced in Canada in 1752 in Halifax, Nova Scotia by John Bushell in the newspaper format. This paper was named the Halifax Gazette and became Canada's first newspaper. Bushell apprenticed under Bartholomew Green in Boston. Green moved to Halifax in 1751 in hopes of starting a newspaper, as it did not exist in the area. Two weeks and a day after the press he was going to use for this new project arrived in Halifax, Green died. Upon receiving word about what happened, Bushell moved to Halifax and continued what Green had started. The Halifax Gazette was first published on March 23, 1752, making Bushell the first letterpress printer in Halifax, and eventually Canada. There is only one known surviving copy which was found in the Massachusetts Historical Society.\n\nOne of the first forms of letterpress printing in the United States was Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick started by Benjamin Harris. This was the first form of a newspaper with multiple pages in the Americas. The first publication of Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick was September 25, 1690.\n\nLetterpress started to become largely out-of-date in the 1970s because of the rise of computers and new self-publishing print and publish methods. Many printing establishments went out of business from the 1980s to 1990s and sold their equipment after computers replaced letterpress's abilities more efficiently. These commercial print shops discarded presses, making them affordable and available to artisans throughout the country. Popular presses are, in particular, Vandercook cylinder proof presses and Chandler & Price platen presses. In the UK there is particular affection for the Arab press, built by Josiah Wade in Halifax.\nLetterpress recently has had a rebirth in popularity because of the \"allure of hand-set type\" and the differences today between traditional letterpress and computerized printed text. Letterpress is unique and different from standard printing formats that we are currently used to. Letterpress commonly features a relief impression of the type, although this was considered bad printing in traditional letterpress. Letterpress's goal before the recent revival of letterpress was to not show any impression. The type touched the paper slightly to leave a transfer of ink, but did not leave an impression. This is often referred to as \"the kiss\" An example of this former technique would be newspapers. Some letterpress practitioners today have the distinct goal of showing the impression of type, to distinctly note that it is letterpress but many printers choose to maintain the integrity of the traditional methods. Printing with too much impression is destructive to both the machines and to the type. Since its revival letterpress has largely been used for fine art and stationery as its traditional use for newspaper printing is no longer relevant for use.\n\nLetterpress is considered a craft as it involves using a skill and is done by hand. Fine letterpress work is crisper than offset litho because of its impression into the paper, giving greater visual definition to the type and artwork, although it is not what letterpress traditionally was meant for. Today, many of these small letterpress shops survive by printing fine editions of books or by printing upscale invitations, stationery, and greeting cards. These methods often use presses that require the press operator to feed paper one sheet at a time by hand. Today, the juxtaposition of this technique and offbeat humor for greeting cards has been proven by letterpress shops to be marketable to independent boutiques and gift shops. Some of these printmakers are just as likely to use new printing methods as old, for instance by printing using photopolymer plates on restored vintage presses.\n\nLetterpress publishing has recently undergone a revival in the USA, Canada, and the UK, under the general banner of the \"Small Press Movement\". Renewed interest in letterpress was fueled by Martha Stewart Weddings magazine, which began using pictures of letterpress invitations in the 1990s. In 2004 they state \"Great care is taken in choosing the perfect wedding stationery – couples ponder details from the level of formality to the flourishes of the typeface. The method of printing should be no less important, as it can enliven the design exquisitely. That is certainly the case with letterpress.\" In regards to having printed letterpress invitations, the beauty and texture became appealing to couples who began wanting letterpress invitations instead of engraved, thermographed, or offset-printed invitations.\n\nThe movement has been helped by the emergence of a number of organizations that teach letterpress such as Columbia College Chicago's Center for Book and Paper Arts, Art Center College of Design and Armory Center for the Arts both in Pasadena, Calif., New York's Center for Book Arts, Studio on the Square and The Arm NYC, the Wells College Book Arts Center in Aurora, New York, the San Francisco Center for the Book, Bookworks, Seattle's School of Visual Concepts, Olympia's The Evergreen State College, Black Rock Press, North Carolina State University, Washington D.C's Corcoran College of Art and Design, Penland School of Crafts, the Minnesota Center for Book Arts, the International Printing Museum in Carson, CA, Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA, Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA, and the Bowehouse Press at VCU in Richmond, VA.\n\nAffordable copper, magnesium and photopolymer platemakers and milled aluminum bases have allowed letterpress printers to produce type and images derived from digital artwork, fonts and scans. Economical plates have encouraged the rise of \"digital letterpress\" in the 21st century, allowing a small number of firms to flourish commercially and enabling a larger number of boutique and hobby printers to avoid the limitations and complications of acquiring and composing metal type. At the same time there has been a renaissance in small-scale type foundries to produce new metal type on Monotype equipment, Thompson casters and the original American Type Founders machines.\n\nThe process of letterpress printing consists of several stages: composition, imposition and lock-up, and printing. In a small shop, all would occur in a single room, whereas in larger printing plants, such as with urban newspapers and magazines, each might form a distinct department with its own room, or even floor.\n\nComposition, or typesetting, is the stage where pieces of movable type are assembled to form the desired text. The person charged with composition is called a \"compositor\" or \"typesetter\", setting letter by letter and line by line.\n\nTraditionally, as in manual composition, it involves selecting the individual type letters from a type case, placing them in a composing stick, which holds several lines, then transferring those to a larger type galley. By this method the compositor gradually builds out the text of an individual page letter by letter. In mechanical typesetting, it may involve using a keyboard to select the type, or even cast the desired type on the spot, as in hot metal typesetting, which are then added to a galley designed for the product of that process. The first keyboard-actuated typesetting machines to be widely accepted, the Linotype and the Monotype, were introduced in the 1890s.\n\nThe Ludlow Typograph Machine, for casting of type-high slugs from hand-gathered brass matrices, was first manufactured in Chicago in 1912 and was widely used until the 1980s. Many are still in use and although no longer manufactured, service and parts are still available for them.\n\nAfter a galley is assembled to fill a page's worth of type, the type is tied together into a single unit so that it may be transported without falling apart. From this bundle a galley proof is made, which is inspected by a proof-reader to make sure that the particular page is accurate.\n\nBroadly, imposition or imposing is the process by which the tied assemblages of type are converted into a form (or forme) ready to use on the press. A person charged with imposition is a stoneman or stonehand, doing their work on a large, flat imposition stone (though some later ones were instead made of iron).\n\nIn the more specific modern sense, imposition is the technique of arranging the various pages of type with respect to one another. Depending on page size and the sheet of paper used, several pages may be printed at once on a single sheet. After printing, these are cut and trimmed before folding or binding. In these steps, the imposition process ensures that the pages face the right direction and in the right order with the correct margins. Printing formes are put together in multiples of 12 pages. The stonehand arranges the pages in such a way that the folios (page numbers) of facing pages add up to the form's total + 1 (12 + 1 = 13, 24 + 1 = 25 etc.)\n\nLow-height pieces of wood or metal furniture are added to make up the blank areas of a page. The printer uses a mallet to strike a wooden block, which ensures tops (and only the tops) of the raised type blocks are all aligned so they will contact a flat sheet of paper simultaneously.\n\nLock-up is the final step before printing. The printer removes the cords that hold the type together, and turns the quoins with a key or lever to lock the entire complex of type, blocks, furniture, and chase (frame) into place. This creates the final forme, which the printer takes to the printing press. In a newspaper setting, each page needs a truck to be transported – 2 pages need 2 trucks hence the term \"double truck\". The first copy is proofed again for errors before starting the printing run.\n\nThe working of the printing process depends on the type of press used, as well as any of its associated technologies (which varied by time period).\n\nHand presses generally required two people to operate them: one to ink the type, the other to work the press. Later mechanized jobbing presses require a single operator to feed and remove the paper, as the inking and pressing are done automatically.\n\nThe completed sheets are then taken to dry and for finishing, depending on the variety of printed matter being produced. With newspapers, they are taken to a folding machine. Sheets for books are sent for bookbinding.\n\nYou can distinguish a traditional letterpress printer from a digital printer by its debossed lettering. A traditional letterpress printer made a heavy impression into the stock and producing any indentation at all into the paper would have resulted in the print run being rejected. Part of the skill of operating a traditional letterpress printer was to adjust the machine pressures just right so that the type just kissed the paper, transferring the minimum amount of ink to create the crispest print with no indentation. This was very important as when the print exited the machine and was stacked having too much wet ink and an indentation would have increased the risk of set-off (ink passing from the front of one sheet onto the back of the next sheet on the stack).\n\nThe letterpress printing process remained virtually unchanged until the 1950s when it was replaced with the more efficient and commercially viable offset printing process. The labor-intensive nature of the typesetting and need to store vast amounts of lead or wooden type resulted in the letterpress printing process falling out of favour.\n\nIn the 1980s dedicated letterpress practitioners revived the old craft by embracing a new manufacturing method which allowed them to create raised surface printing plates from a negative and a photopolymer plate.\n\nPhotopolymer plates are light sensitive. On one side the surface is cured when it is exposed to ultraviolet light and other side is a metal or plastic backing that can be mounted on a base. The relief printing surface is created by placing a negative of the piece to be printed on the photosensitive side of the plate; the light passing through the clear regions of the negative causes the photopolymer to harden. The unexposed areas remain soft and can be washed away with water.\n\nWith these new printing plates, designers were no longer inhibited by the limitations of handset wooden or lead type. New design possibilities emerged and the letterpress printing process experienced a revival. Today it is in high demand for wedding stationery however there are limitations to what can be printed and designers must adhere to some design for letterpress principles.\n\nThe invention of ultra-violet curing inks has helped keep the rotary letterpress alive in areas like self-adhesive labels. There is also still a large amount of flexographic printing, a similar process, which uses rubber plates to print on curved or awkward surfaces, and a lesser amount of relief printing from huge wooden letters for lower-quality poster work.\n\nRotary letterpress machines are still used on a wide scale for printing self-adhesive and non-self-adhesive labels, tube laminate, cup stock, etc. The printing quality achieved by a modern letterpress machine with UV curing is on par with flexo presses. It is more convenient and user friendly than a flexo press. It uses water-wash photopolymer plates, which are as good as any solvent-washed flexo plate. Today even CtP (computer-to-plate) plates are available making it a full-fledged, modern printing process. Because there is no anilox roller in the process, the make-ready time also goes down when compared to a flexo press. Inking is controlled by keys very much similar to an offset press. UV inks for letterpress are in paste form, unlike flexo. Various manufacturers produce UV rotary letterpress machines, viz. Dashen, Nickel, Taiyo Kikai, KoPack, Gallus, etc. – and offer hot/cold foil stamping, rotary die cutting, flatbed die cutting, sheeting, rotary screen printing, adhesive side printing, and inkjet numbering. Central impression presses are more popular than inline presses due to their ease of registration and simple design. Printing of up to nine colours plus varnish is possible with various online converting processes. But as the letterpress machines are the same like a decade before, they can furthermore only be used with one colour of choice simultaneously. If there are more colours needed, they have to be exchanged one after the other.\n\nLetterpress can produce work of high quality at high speed, but it requires much time to adjust the press for varying thicknesses of type, engravings, and plates called makeready. The process requires a high degree of craftsmanship, but in the right hands, letterpress excels at fine typography. It is used by many small presses that produce fine, handmade, limited-edition books, artists' books, and high-end ephemera such as greeting cards and broadsides. Because of the time needed to make letterpress plates and to prepare the press, setting type by hand has become less common with the invention of the photopolymer plate, a photosensitive plastic sheet that can be mounted on metal to bring it up to type high.\n\nTo bring out the best attributes of letterpress, printers must understand the capabilities and advantages of what can be a very unforgiving medium. For instance, since most letterpress equipment prints only one color at a time, printing multiple colors requires a separate press run in register with the preceding color. When offset printing arrived in the 1950s, it cost less, and made the color process easier. The inking system on letterpress equipment is the same as offset presses, posing problems for some graphics. Detailed, white (or \"knocked out\") areas, such as small, serif type, or very fine halftone surrounded by fields of color can fill in with ink and lose definition if Rollers are not adjusted correctly. However, a skilled printer overcomes most of these problems. However, a letterpress provides the option of a wider range of paper, including handmade, organic, and tree-free. Letterpress printing provides a wide range of production choices. The classic feel and finish of letterpress papers takes printing back to an era of quality and craftsmanship. Even the smell of the ink, more apparent on a letterpress-printed page than with offset, may appeal to collectors.\n\nWhile less common in contemporary letterpress printing, it is possible to print halftone photographs, via photopolymer plates. However, letterpress printing's strengths are crisp lines, patterns, and typography.\nCreating files for letterpress is similar to conventional printing.\n\nSeveral dozen colleges and universities around the United States have either begun or re-activated programs teaching letterpress printing in fully equipped facilities. In many cases these letterpress shops are affiliated with the college's library or art department, and in others they are independent, student-run operations or extracurricular activities sponsored by the college. The College & University Letterpress Printers' Association (CULPA) was founded in 2006 by Abigail Uhteg at the Maryland Institute College of Art to help these schools stay connected and share resources. Many universities offer degree programs such as: Oregon College of Art and Craft, Southwest School of Art, Middle Tennessee State University, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Indiana University, Miami University, Corcoran College of Art and Design, and Rochester Institute of Technology.\n\nThe current renaissance of letterpress printing has created a crop of hobby press shops that are owner-operated and driven by a love of the craft. Several larger printers have added an environmental component to the venerable art by using only wind-generated electricity to drive their presses and plant equipment.\nNotably, a few small boutique letterpress shops are using only solar power.\n\nIn Berkeley, California, letterpress printer and lithographer David Goines maintains a studio with a variety of platen and cylinder letterpresses as well as lithography presses. He has drawn attention both from commercial printers and fine artists for his wide knowledge and meticulous skill with letterpress printing. He collaborated with restaurateur and free speech activist Alice Waters, the owner of Chez Panisse, on her book \"30 Recipes Suitable for Framing\". He has created strikingly colorful large posters for such Bay Area businesses and institutions as Acme Bread and UC Berkeley.\n\nIn London, St Bride Library houses a large collection of letterpress information in its collection of 50,000 books: all the classic works on printing technique, visual style, typography, graphic design, calligraphy and more. This is one of the world's foremost collections and is located off Fleet Street in the heart of London's old printing and publishing district. In addition, regular talks, conferences, exhibitions and demonstrations take place.\n\nThe St Bride Institute, Edinburgh College of Art, Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, The Arts University Bournemouth, Plymouth University, University for the Creative Arts Farnham, London College of Communication and Camberwell College of the Arts London run short courses in letterpress as well as offering these facilities as part of their Graphic Design Degree Courses.\n\nThe Hamilton Wood Type and Printing Museum in Two Rivers, Wisconsin houses one of the largest collections of wood type and wood cuts in the world inside one of the Hamilton Manufacturing Company's factory buildings. Also included are presses and vintage prints. The museum holds many workshops and conferences throughout the year and regularly welcomes groups of students from Universities from across the United States.\n\nIn 2011 John Bonadies and Jeff Adams created a virtual letterpress that runs on an iPad (and later the Mac) and replicates each step of the letterpress process. LetterMpress was funded from a Kickstarter campaign enabling the developers to collect and digitize wood type from around the world. The app's press is modeled after a Vandercook SP-15 (considered to be a top-of-the-line proof press in its time, and coveted by artists and designers today).\n\nIn 2015 a renaissance of letterpress printing by artists is widely acknowledged.\n\n\n\n"}

She also wrote a series of career guidance books for young people and a biography of the 12th-century philosopher Adelard of Bath.\n\nLouise Cochrane (née Morley) was born in New York on 22 December 1918. Her father, Christopher Morley, was a writer. After attending Hunter College High School she enrolled at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania to study politics. After graduating in 1940 she spent a short time working for Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of American President Franklin D Roosevelt. Later that year she joined the International Student Service, with responsibility for organising its conference programme. There in 1942 she met Scotsman Peter Cochrane, a delegate visiting from Britain, within a year she had joined him in England, and the couple were married a few weeks later.\n\nCochrane joined the BBC in 1948 as a producer of schools' news and current affairs programmes, and was appointed to the Fulbright Commission two years later. In 1953 Cochrane wrote the first of her 26 episodes of \"Rag, Tag and Bobtail\", a children's television series that \"continues to be remembered with affection\". She also wrote a series of four books giving career guidance for young people.\n\nIn 1958 Cochrane moved with her husband and two daughters to Sussex, where she took up secondary school teaching. Ten years later the family moved to the area around Bath, which along with her keen interest in mathematics, and geometry in particular, triggered Cochrane's long-standing interest in the 12th-century philosopher Adelard of Bath, of whom she published a biography in 1994.\n\nThe Cochranes relocated to Edinburgh in 1979, where Louise remained active despite her failing eyesight. She died on 13 February 2012 aged 93, survived by her husband and daughters Alison and Janet.\n\n\nNotes\nCitations\n"}

The media of New York City are internationally influential and include some of the most important newspapers, largest publishing houses, biggest record companies, and most prolific television studios in the world. It is a major global center for the book and magazine publishing, music, newspaper, and television industries.\n\nNew York is also the largest media market in North America (followed by Los Angeles, Chicago, and Toronto). Some of the city's media conglomerates include CNN (Turner), the Hearst Corporation, NBCUniversal, CBS, The New York Times Company, the 21st Century Fox and News Corp, the Thomson Reuters Corporation, WarnerMedia, and Viacom. Seven of the world's top eight global advertising agency networks are headquartered in New York. Three of the \"Big Four\" record labels are also headquartered or co-headquartered in the city. One-third of all American independent films are produced in New York. More than 200 newspapers and 350 consumer magazines have an office in the city and the book-publishing industry employs about 25,000 people.\n\nTwo of the three national daily newspapers in the United States are \"The New York Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\". Major tabloid newspapers in the city include the \"Daily News\", \"Newsday\" (which is technically headquartered in Melville, New York), and the \"New York Post\", founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton. The city also has a major ethnic press, with 270 newspapers and magazines published in more than 40 languages. \"El Diario La Prensa\" is New York's largest Spanish-language daily and the oldest in the nation. \"The New York Amsterdam News\", published in Harlem, is a prominent African-American newspaper. \"The Village Voice\" was the largest alternative newspaper, ceasing all forms of publication August 31, 2018.\n\nThe television industry developed in New York and is a significant employer in the city's economy. The four major American broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, are all headquartered in New York. Many cable channels are based in the city as well, including MTV, Fox News, HBO and Comedy Central. In 2005 there were more than 100 television shows taped in New York City.\n\nNew York is also a major center for non-commercial media. The oldest public-access cable television channel in the United States is the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, founded in 1971. WNET is the city's major public television station and a primary provider of national Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) programming. WNYC, a public radio station owned by the city until 1997, has the largest public radio audience in the United States. The City of New York operates a public broadcast service, NYC Media, that produces several original New York Emmy Award-winning shows covering music and culture in city neighborhoods, as well as city government-access television (GATV).\n\nNew York City is home to a number of major online media companies, including Verizon's digital content subsidiary Oath Inc. and its operations under the AOL brand, along with news and entertainment companies like BuzzFeed and VICE Media.\n\nThe book publishing industry in the United States is based in New York. Publishing houses in the city range from industry giants such as Penguin Group (USA), HarperCollins, Random House, Scholastic, Simon & Schuster, and Macmillan to small niche houses like Melville House and Lee & Low Books. New York has also been the setting for countless works of literature, many of them produced by the city's large population of writers (which have included Paul Auster, Don DeLillo, Bret Easton Ellis, Jonathan Safran Foer, Jonathan Franzen, Jhumpa Lahiri, Jonathan Lethem, John O'Hara, Dorothy Parker, Thomas Pynchon, Susan Sontag and many others). The New York City metro area, home to the largest number of Jews outside Israel, has also been a flourishing scene for Jewish American literature.\n\nNew York is also home to PEN American Center, the largest of the 141 centers of International PEN, the world’s oldest human rights organization and the oldest international literary organization. PEN American Center plays an important role in New York's literary community and is active in defending free speech, the promotion of literature, and the fostering of international literary fellowship. Author Salman Rushdie is its current president.\n\nSome of the most important literary journals in the United States are in New York. These include \"The Paris Review\", \"The New York Review of Books\", \"n+1\", and \"New York Quarterly\". Other New York literary publications include \"Circumference\", \"Open City\", \"The Manhattan Review\", \"The Coffin Factory\", \"Fence\", and \"Telos\". New York is also home to the US offices of \"Granta\".\n\nNew York is a prominent location for the American entertainment industry, with many films, television series, books, and other media being set there. , New York City was the second largest center for filmmaking and television production in the United States, producing about 200 feature films annually, employing 130,000 individuals; the filmed entertainment industry has been growing in New York, contributing nearly US$9 billion to the New York City economy alone as of 2015, and by volume, New York is the world leader in independent film production – one-third of all American independent films are produced in New York City. The Association of Independent Commercial Producers is also based in New York. In the first five months of 2014 alone, location filming for television pilots in New York City exceeded the record production levels for all of 2013, with New York surpassing Los Angeles as the top North American city for the same distinction during the 2013/2014 cycle. International film makers are featured prominently in New York City as well.\n\nIn the earliest days of the American film industry, New York was the epicenter of filmmaking. However, the drier weather of Hollywood and tax incentives offered at the time by filming in Los Angeles made California a better choice for film production throughout much of the 20th century. The Kaufman Astoria Studios film studio, built during the silent film era, was used by the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields, and has expanded its footprint in Queens. It has also been used for \"The Cosby Show\", \"Sesame Street\" and the films of Woody Allen. The recently constructed Steiner Studios is a 15-acre (61,000 m²) modern movie studio complex in a former shipyard where \"The Producers\" and \"The Inside Man\", a Spike Lee movie, were filmed.\n\nNew York was, and to a certain extent still is, also important within the animation industry. Until 1938, it served as the home of Fleischer Studios (who produced the Popeye, Betty Boop, and Color Classics shorts for Paramount Pictures) as well as the Van Beuren Studios (who produced animated shorts for RKO Radio Pictures) until 1937. It would later be the home for Famous Studios (who replaced Fleischer Studios and continued the production of Popeye shorts for Paramount) from 1943 to the 1960s. Its current position in the animation world is as an alternative to Los Angeles (where most U.S. animation is produced), and the city now houses several schools and school programs concerning animation, and stands as a source of work for animators working for any medium, from advertising to film.\n\nSilvercup Studios has expanded in Long Island City, Queens with numerous soundstages, production and studio support space, offices for media and entertainment companies, stores, 1,000 apartments in high-rise towers, a catering hall and a cultural institution, built at the edge of the East River in Queens, overlooking Manhattan, and maintaining its status as the largest production house on the U.S. East Coast. Steiner Studios in Brooklyn still has the largest individual soundstage, however. Miramax Films, a Big Ten film studio, was the largest motion picture distribution and production company headquartered in the city until it moved to Burbank, California in January 2010. Many smaller independent producers and distributors are located in New York.\n\n\nNew York City has a long history in American magazine publishing. The 19th century was rife with popular titles: \"Harper's Weekly\" launched in 1857, claiming to be \"A Journal of Civilization\" to readers; \"St. Nicholas Magazine\", founded by Scribner's in 1873, was a pioneering children's publication; and \"Collier's Weekly\", founded in 1888 by Peter Fenelon Collier, counted Upton Sinclair and Ernest Hemingway as contributors. \"New York\" magazine, founded in 1968 by Milton Glaser and Clay Felker, was one of the first \"lifestyle\" magazines. \"The New Yorker\", founded in 1925 by Harold Ross, is a weekly magazine of arts, literature, and journalism.\n\nAt one point, more than 350 magazines have their editorial offices based in the city. New York is home to the corporate headquarters of such publishing giants as:\nAmong other national leaders based in New York city are \"Newsweek\", owned by The Newsweek Daily Beast Company\", and Rolling Stone\", published by Wenner Media.\n\nIn the 1930s, New York-based RCA was the nation's largest manufacturer of phonographs. In the late 19th and early 20th century, most sheet music in the United States — especially the popular songs of the day, many now standards — was printed at Tin Pan Alley, so called because the constant sound of new songs being tried out on pianos in the publishing houses was said to sound like a tin pan. By the early 1960s the radio and musical stars of the Golden Age of Broadway gave way to the Brill Building's \"Brill Sound\".\n\nSalsa music, which got its start in New York City in the mid-1960s, was popularized by the New York record label Fania Records, which developed a highly polished \"Fania sound\" that came to be synonymous with salsa.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, hip hop labels including Def Jam, Roc-A-Fella and Bad Boy Records were founded in New York, creating what is known as East Coast hip hop. These labels continue to be among the largest hip-hop labels in the world. Other influential New York-based hip hop labels, past and present, include Cold Chillin' Records, Jive Records, Loud Records, Rawkus Records and Tommy Boy Records.\n\nTwo of the \"Big Four\" music labels are headquartered in the city: Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group. The world headquarters of MTV is also in New York.\n\nMany major music magazines are headquartered in the city as well, including \"Blender Magazine\", \"Punk Magazine\", \"Spin\" and \"Rolling Stone\".\n\nNew York City is home to 4 of the 10 largest papers in the United States. These include \"The New York Times\" (circulation 1.1 million), the \"Daily News\" (circulation 795,000), and \"New York Post\" (circulation 650,000). \"The Wall Street Journal\" (circulation 2.1 million), published in New York City, is a national-scope business newspaper and the first or second most-read newspaper in the nation, depending on measurement method.\n\"El Diario La Prensa\" (circulation 265,000) is New York's largest Spanish-language daily and the oldest in the nation. There are also several borough-specific newspapers, such as \"The Brooklyn Daily Eagle\" and \"The Staten Island Advance\". Free daily newspapers mainly distributed to commuters include \"amNewYork\", \"Hoy\" and \"Metro New York\". In addition to the print newspapers, \"BKLYNER\" is the leading daily digital news publication reporting on local news and events in Brooklyn.\n\nThe city's ethnic press is large and diverse. Major ethnic publications include the Roman Catholic diocesan paper for Brooklyn-Queens, \"The Tablet\" and Jewish-American newspapers \"The Jewish Daily Forward\" (פֿאָרװערטס; \"Forverts\", published in Yiddish and English) (founded in 1897), and African-American newspapers, including the long-time newspaper \"The New York Amsterdam News\" (founded in 1909) and Brooklyn-based Our Time Press. \"The Epoch Times\", an international newspaper published by the Falun Gong, has English and Chinese editions in New York. There are seven dailies published in the Chinese and four in Spanish. Multiple daily papers are published in Greek, Polish, and Korean, and other weekly newspapers serve dozens of different ethnic communities, with ten separate newspapers focusing on the African-American community alone. Many nationally distributed ethnic newspapers are based in Astoria, Chinatown or Brooklyn. Over 60 ethnic groups, writing in 42 languages, publish some 300 non-English language magazines and newspapers in New York City.\n\nEthnic variation is not the only measure of the diversity of New York City's newspapers, with editorial opinions running from left-leaning at alternative papers like the \"Village Voice\", to conservative at the \"New York Post\". \"New York Observer\" covers politics and the city's rich and powerful with unusual depth. The tradition of a free press owes much to John Peter Zenger, a New York publisher who was acquitted in his 1735 landmark court case, setting the precedent that truth was a legitimate defense against accusations of libel.\n\nMajor newspapers emphasizing coverage of the New York metropolitan region outside the city include \"Newsday\", which covers primarily Long Island but also New York City, (especially Brooklyn and Queens), \"The Journal News\", which covers Westchester County, to the north along the Hudson River and \"The Bergen Record\" and \"The Star-Ledger\", of Newark which cover northern New Jersey across the New York Bay and Hudson River to the west.\n\nNew York City's digital companies, sometimes described as \"Silicon Alley\", include both software companies and companies known primarily as content producers. Among the former are Tumblr (now owned by Yahoo!), FourSquare and AOL. Among the latter are Gawker Media, BuzzFeed, and some of AOL's holdings, including HuffPost and Weblogs, Inc. The satirical newspaper \"The Onion\" (online-only since 2013) was based in New York from 2000 to 2012.\n\nNew York City has a tradition as an important place in radio broadcasting. Edward R. Murrow defined American broadcast journalism with his World War II reporting from Europe relayed back to CBS in New York and onward to the rest of the nation.\n\nWNYC, New York's flagship public radio station, is the most-listened to commercial or non-commercial radio station in Manhattan and has the largest audience of any public radio station in the United States. It produces several news and cultural programs for national syndication.\n\nThe current WQXR-FM, a public radio station, is the New York City's only classical radio station. The former WQXR-FM (today WXNY-FM), is now a Spanish station as of November 1, 2009. The license was formerly owned by \"The New York Times\", and swapped with the former WCAA (today WQXR-FM) with \"Univision\". The \"Times\" sold WCAA and the intellectual property of WQXR-FM (call letters and format) to the New York Public Radio.\n\nWBAI in Manhattan, with news and information programming, is one of the few socialist radio stations operating in the United States.\n\nFordham University's WFUV, New York University's WNYU and Columbia University's WKCR are also important non-commercial stations in the city.\n\nThe first New York City radio station to feature a phone-in talk format was WNBC in the late 1960s, (with Long John Nebel in the early morning hours) but the format began in earnest in New York in 1970, when WMCA radio dropped its \"Good Guys\" top-40 radio format in favor of the \"Dial-Log Radio\" slate of call-in shows. In addition to mainstay Barry Gray, the format featured such prominent talkers as Nebel, Alex Bennett and Bob Grant.\n\nRight-wing talk radio came to New York when WABC switched from an all music format to talk in 1982. Though it began with a moribund \"Talkradio\" format delivered via satellite from KABC Los Angeles, the station eventually became the home of nationally syndicated conservative powerhouse Rush Limbaugh, who in the Reagan years railed against liberal figures like civil-rights advocate Jesse Jackson and former New York Governor Mario Cuomo. Other high-profile conservative talk radio hosts with national profiles include Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity at WABC.\n\nLiberals responded, first with the short-lived (only nine years) WEVD format with Bill Mazer's \"Mazer in the morning\" and Sam Greenfield in the afternoon followed by Alan Colmes from 11 PM to 2AM. In March 2004 the Air America Radio network started, based in New York City, with actor-comedians Al Franken and Janeane Garofalo as their front line stars. A personality who goes by one name, \"Lionel\", who was a host on WABC also joined the Air America's New York local lineup. Air American's flagship station was originally WLIB, then WWRL at the time of its January 2010 demise. WWRL and listener supported WBAI continue broadcasting progressive talk.\n\nNew York is also home to several famous \"shock jock\" morning drive shows. They include the new current flavor Opie and Anthony as well as old timer Don Imus, (famous for his controversial statements, interviews of politicos and morning satire) and Elvis Duran and the Morning Show on Z100. The nation's first female shock jock, Wendy Williams, had a popular syndicated afternoon show on Urban AC WBLS from 2002-2009. WXRK, formerly known as 92.3 \"K-Rock\", used to be the home of Howard Stern until his move from terrestrial radio to Sirius Satellite Radio, though Stern still broadcasts from New York City.\n\nWQHT, also known as \"Hot 97\", is an influential high-profile commercial radio station that is arguably the nation's premier hip-hop station. Doctor Dré and Ed Lover were morning hosts at the station in the 1990s. The highest-rated Spanish-language radio show in the United States is the morning radio program \"El Vacilón de la Mañana\", broadcast on WSKQ and formerly hosted by Luis Jimenez.\n\nNew York became home to America's first 24-hour @ talk station, WFAN, in 1987.\n\nThe Following is a list of radio stations in New York City.\n\nAM:\nFM:\n\nNew York City is the home of the three traditional major American television networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, as well as Spanish-language network Univision. They each have local broadcast owned and operated stations which serve as the flagship stations of their networks.\n\nIt is also the headquarters of several large cable television channels, including MTV, Fox News, HBO, and Comedy Central. Silvercup Studios, located in Queens was the production facility for the popular television shows \"Sex and the City\" and \"The Sopranos\". MTV broadcasts programming from its sound stage overlooking Times Square, several blocks away from The Ed Sullivan Theater, the theater housing the \"Late Show with Stephen Colbert\". \"Saturday Night Live\" is broadcast from NBC's studios at 30 Rockefeller Center, where \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\", \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\", \"NBC Nightly News\" and \"The Today Show\" is also taped. BET is headquartered on 57th Street. \"The Colbert Report\" is produced by Comedy Central on 54th Street, and \"The Daily Show\", also produced by Comedy Central, is produced just a few blocks over on 11th avenue and West 53rd street. Glenn Beck's The Blaze TV has a studio in Manhattan. Over a thousand people are involved with producing the various \"Law & Order\" television series. In 2005 there were more than 100 new and returning television shows taped in New York City, according to the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting.\n\nWNET, New York's largest public television station, is a primary national provider of PBS programming. The oldest Public-access television cable TV in the United States is the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, well known for its eclectic local origination programming that ranges from a jazz hour to discussion of labor issues to foreign language and religious programming. There are eight other Public-access television channels in New York, including Brooklyn Community Access Television (BCAT). As part of use of local rights-of-way, the cable operators in New York have granted Public, educational, and government access (PEG) organizations channels for programming. They also carry the New York State legislative channel available on cable packages with sufficient bandwidth.\n\nAnother notable channel in the city is NY1, established in 1992 as Time Warner Cable's first local news channel and acquired with the rest of Time Warner Cable by Charter Communications in May 2016. NY1 is known for its beat coverage of city neighborhoods, and its coverage of City Hall and state politics is closely watched by political insiders.\n\nFor years, several soap operas were filmed in the New York City area, including \"Another World\", \"As the World Turns\", \"Guiding Light\", \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\". As of 2012, there are no New York soap operas left on the air.\n\nBold letters indicate a network owned-and-operated station, and Bold italics indicate a network flagship station.\n\nThe City of New York operates a public broadcast service, NYC Media, (on WNYE-TV Channel 25) that produces several original Emmy Award-winning shows including \"Blue Print New York\" and \"Cool in Your Code\", as well as coverage of city government. Other popular programs on WNYE-TV include music shows; \"New York Noise\" showcases music videos of local, underground, and indie rock musicians as well as coverage of major music-related events in the city like the WFMU Record Fair, interviews of New York icons (like The Ramones and Klaus Nomi), and comedian hosts (like Eugene Mirman, Rob Huebel, and Aziz Ansari). \"The Bridge\", similarly, chronicles old school hip hop. The channel has won 14 New York Emmys and 14 National Telly awards.\n\nThe City University of New York's cable channel provides on air telecourses in psychology, physics, geography, history, as well as vast array of cultural programing on CUNY TV. New York University (NYU) has its NYUTV.\n\nBecause of its sheer size and cultural influence, New York City has been the subject of many different, and often contradictory, portrayals in mass media. From the sophisticated and worldly metropolis seen in many Woody Allen films, to the hellish and chaotic urban jungle depicted in such movies as Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), New York has served as the unwitting backdrop for virtually every conceivable viewpoint on big city life.\n\nIn the early years of film New York City was characterized as urbane and sophisticated. By the city's crisis period in the 1970s, however, films like \"Midnight Cowboy\" (1969), \"The French Connection\" (1971), and \"Death Wish\" (1974) showed New York as full of chaos and violence. With the city's renaissance in the 1990s came new portrayals on television; \"Seinfeld\", \"Friends\", and \"Sex and the City\" showed life in the city to be glamorous and interesting. Nonetheless a disproportionate number of crime dramas, such as \"Law & Order\" and the \"Spider-Man\" film series, continue to use the city as their setting despite New York's status as the safest large city in the United States after plummeting crime rates over many years.\n\nAn essay appearing in the Arts section of \"The New York Times\" in April 2006 quoted several filmmakers, including Sidney Lumet and Paul Mazursky, describing how modern cinema shows the city as far more \"teeming, terrifying, exhilarating, unforgiving\" than contemporary New York actually is, and the consequential challenge this poses for filmmakers. The article quotes Robert Greenhut, Woody Allen's producer, as saying that despite the increased sanitization of modern New York, \"New Yorkers' personalities are different to Chicago. There's a certain kind of vibrancy and tone that you can't get elsewhere. The labor pool is more interesting than elsewhere — the salesgirl with one line, or the cop. That's who directors are looking for.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Little is known of his life, but his work has been collected internationally and he was said to be well respected in his home village.\n\nNgongo ya Chintu (an honorific title meaning \"the great leopard, the father of sculpted things\") worked in what was then the Kingdom of Luba somewhere in between 1810 and 1870. He carried on a long tradition of Hemba art. Hemba sculpture usually honored prominent male leaders of the tribe. Ngongo ya Chintu carved both ancestor figures and female figures such as vessel bearers and caryatids which served as stools for leaders.\n\nAccording to Alisa LaGamma in \"Heroic Africans: Legendary Leaders, Iconic Sculptures\":\n\nThe artist's signature expressionistic style features exaggeration of the face and hands through elongation, which allowed him to reinterpret and ingeniously exploit the formal possibilities of different genres of prestige sculpture: standing figures as caryatid supports for seats...seated \"mboko\" (bowl bearers)...and stately male figures\n\nIn the 1930s, Belgian art historian Frans Olbrechts that ten figures being put together for an exhibition shared similar characteristics, and that two had been collected in the same town, Buli. As nothing was yet known of the sculptor in Western circles, Olbrechts gave him the title \"Master of Buli.\" In the 1970s Ngonogo ya Chintu was identified by the owners of one of his figures as being an artist from the village of Kateba. Marilyn Stokstad notes that villagers in Kateba knew of the master's work, as he was well regarded there.\n\n"}

{"id": "2936900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2936900", "title": "Piled Higher and Deeper", "text": "Piled Higher and Deeper\n\nPiled Higher and Deeper (also known as PhD Comics), is a newspaper and webcomic strip written and drawn by Jorge Cham that follows the lives of several grad students. First published in the fall of 1997 when Cham was a grad student himself at Stanford University, the strip deals with issues of life in graduate school, including the difficulties of scientific research, the perils of procrastination, the complex student–supervisor relationship and the perpetual search for free food. Cham continued the strip as an Instructor in mechanical engineering at Caltech, and now draws and gives talks about the strip full-time. Originally, the strip was drawn in crude black-and-white, eventually became grayscale, and finally became color in June 2004.\n\n\"Piled Higher and Deeper\" introduced its main characters early in its run, and their personalities have remained fairly constant during the strip's several years of publication. In the strip's first few seasons, the characters were clearly Stanford University students, though the number of school-specific references and jokes has decreased since.\n\n\n\nThe title of the comic comes from an old joke about becoming a Ph.D., which explains that if one knows what \"B.S.\" stands for (in this context, \"bullshit\"), then \"M.S.\" stands for \"More of the Same\" (or \"More Shit\"), and \"Ph.D.\" stands for \"Piled Higher and Deeper\".\n\nOne of Cham's recurring themes is to re-cast an item of popular culture in the grad-school milieu. Upon several occasions, the strip has included spoofs of popular movies, like \"The Thesis\" (\"The Matrix\"), \"Raiders of the Lost Dissertation\" (\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"), \"I, Grad Student\" (a mixture of the book and movie \"I, Robot\"), and \"Summer days\" (\"Summer Nights\"). In addition, Cham has parodied television programs like \"The Jerry Springer Show,\" among others.\n\nJorge Cham has also parodied Newton's laws of motion as \"Newton's 3 Laws of Graduation\". According to the strip these laws of graduation were superseded by Einstein's \"Special Theory of Research Inactivity\", much as Newton's actual laws were superseded by Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.\n\nAnother series of strips takes up the modern debate about the proper use of the term \"irony\".\n\nThe strip has also included several adaptations of Shakespeare as well as several propaganda posters. Captions for the latter include \"This man does research for \"you!\"\", \"When you procrastinate... Someone is watching!\" and \"Women in grad school... Support your local female geek.\"\n\nCham has also released two song parodies, purportedly sung by Tajel, in MP3 format: \"Closer to fine\" (cf. Indigo Girls) and \"Who will grade your work\" (\"Who Will Save Your Soul\").\n\nFive PhD comic books have been published so far. The first book, \"Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Comic Strip Collection\" (2002), contains production sketches and an afterword by Prof. Smith in addition to the comic strips.\n\nThe second volume, \"Life is Tough and then You Graduate\", was published in April 2005. It contains six strips not published online that explain what happened in Mike's thesis defense. It also has a foreword by Karl Marx, behind-the-scenes author notes and a graduate school board game.\n\nThe third book, \"Scooped!\", which was released in May 2007, also contains \"Tales from the Road\", a series of comics that detail Cham's experiences whilst giving his Power of Procrastination tour.\n\nThe fourth book, \"Academic Stimulus Package\", was released March 2009. This volume is printed in full color.\n\nThe fifth book, \"Adventures in Thesisland\", was released April 2012. This volume is also printed in full color. The introduction is an excerpt from the screenplay of the PHD Movie.\n\nIn March 2011, Jorge Cham started filming a movie based on the comic series. The film production is a collaboration between Cham and a theater group at the California Institute of Technology. In fall 2011, the film was released on selected academic campuses. A trailer of the movie is available on the Piled Higher and Deeper website as of June 8, 2011. After about a year of various campus screenings around the world, the movie became available for purchase on DVD or streaming on April 15, 2012. The sequel to the movie was shot in the Caltech campus and was released later in 2015. For the first time in India, it was screened in IIT Madras on 8 April 2016 as part of their Research Scholars Day-2016.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28424452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28424452", "title": "Plain tobacco packaging", "text": "Plain tobacco packaging\n\nPlain tobacco packaging, also known as generic, neutral, standardised or homogeneous packaging, refers to packaging that requires the removal of all branding (colours, imagery, corporate logos and trademarks), permitting manufacturers to print only the brand name in a mandated size, font and place on the pack, in addition to the health warnings and any other legally mandated information such as toxic constituents and tax-paid stamps. The appearance of all tobacco packs is standardised, including the colour of the pack.\n\nThe removal of branding on cigarette packaging aims to deter smoking by removal of positive associations of brands (including design and symbol) with the consumption of tobacco. It also aims to remove an available avenue of brand advertising for cigarette companies.\n\nAustralia was the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging, with all packets sold from 1 December 2012 being sold in logo-free, drab dark brown packaging. There has been opposition from tobacco companies to plain packaging laws, some of which have sued the Australian government. Since the Australian government won the court cases, several other countries have enacted plain packaging laws.\n\nPlain packaging was included in guidelines to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). On 31 May 2016, on World No Tobacco Day, the WHO called on governments to get ready for plain packaging of tobacco products.\n\nPlain packaging appears to have been first suggested in 1989 by the New Zealand Department of Health’s Toxic Substances Board which recommended that cigarettes be sold only in white packs with black text and no colours or logos.\n\nPublic health officials in Canada developed proposals for plain packaging of tobacco products in 1994. A parliamentary committee reviewed the evidence and concluded that plain packaging could be a “reasonable step in the overall strategy to reduce tobacco consumption”. This effort did not succeed due to trademark right concerns, specifically those related to Canada's commitments to the World Trade Organization and under the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nAustralia, with the enactment of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act on 12 December 2011, became the first country in the world to require tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging. Products manufactured after 1 October 2012, and all on sale after 1 December 2012 must be in the plain packaging.\n\nFollowing Australia's lead (2012) a number of other countries also require standardized packaging including France (January 2017), United Kingdom (May 2017), New Zealand (June 2018), Norway (July 2018), Ireland (September 2018), Hungary (May 2019) and Singapore (2020). Belgium, Hungary, Slovenia and Uruguay have plain packaging cigarette laws, but are yet to go into effect.\n\nOnly indirect evidence of plain packaging's effectiveness was available until its release in Australia. On 24 May 2011, Cancer Council Australia released a review of the evidence supporting the introduction of plain packaging to reduce youth uptake. The review had been conducted by Quit Victoria and Cancer Council Victoria. The review includes 24 peer-reviewed studies conducted over two decades, suggesting that packaging plays an important role in encouraging young people to try cigarettes. First impressions in Australia indicated that smokers feel that cigarettes taste worse in plain packaging – an unexpected side effect. In addition, evidence from quantitative studies, qualitative research and the internal documents of the tobacco industry consistently identify packaging as an important part of tobacco promotion.\n\nPlain packaging can change people's attitudes towards smoking and may help reduce the prevalence of smoking, including among minors, and increase attempts to quit.\n\nStudies comparing existing branded cigarette packs with plain cardboard packs bearing the name and number of cigarettes in small standard font, found plain packs to be significantly less attractive. Additionally, research in which young adults were instructed to use plain cigarette packs and subsequently asked about their feelings towards them confirmed findings that plain packaging increased negative perceptions and feelings about the pack and about smoking. Plain packs also increased behaviours such as hiding or covering the pack, smoking less around others, going without cigarettes and increased thinking about quitting. Almost half of the participants reported that plain packs had either increased the above behaviours or reduced consumption. Auction experiments indicated that a likely outcome of plain packaging would be to drive down demand of tobacco products.\n\nA 2013 review found that plain packaging increased the importance of health warnings to consumers. Plain packaging in a darker colour was associated with more harmful effects. Furthermore, plain packaging reduced confusion about health warnings.\n\nPlain packaging with large, graphic, warnings, was considered to impact on smoking cessation.\n\nThere is little evidence yet as to what effect plain packaging will have on smoking in lower-income countries.\n\nAdvertisement companies and consultants for the tobacco industry expressed concerns that plain cigarette packaging may establish a precedent for application in other industries. In 2012, correspondence between Mars, Incorporated and the UK Department of Health conveyed concerns that plain packaging could be extended to the food and beverage industry. Together, with other policies such as tobacco taxes, plain packaging is considered by some as a form of social engineering.\n\nA study commissioned by Philip Morris International indicated that plain packaging would shift consumer preferences away from premium towards cheaper brands.\n\nThe tobacco industry also expressed concern that plain packaging would increase the sales of counterfeit cigarettes. Roy Ramm, former commander of Specialist Operations at New Scotland Yard and founding member of The Common Sense Alliance, a think tank supported by British American Tobacco, stated that it would be \"disastrous if the government, by introducing plain-packaging legislation, [removed] the simplest mechanism for the ordinary consumer to tell whether their cigarettes are counterfeit or not.\"\n\nArguments against plain packaging include its effect on smuggling, its effect on shops and retailers, and its possible illegality. A study published in July 2014 by the British Medical Journal refuted those claims.\n\nIn reporting Philip Morris's legal action against the Australian project, \"The Times of India\" noted in 2011 that plain packaging legislation was being closely watched by other countries, and that tobacco firms were worried the Australian plain packaging legislation might set a global precedent.\n\nIn July 2012 it was reported that the American lobbying organisation American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) had launched a worldwide campaign against plain packaging of cigarettes. With the backing of tobacco companies and other corporate interests, it was targeting governments planning to introduce bans on cigarette branding, including the UK and Australia. Tobacco companies were also reported to have provided legal advice and funding to Ukraine and Honduras governments to launch a complaint in the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the grounds that the Australian legislation is contrary to a WTO intellectual property agreement. WTO complaints must be made by Governments, not companies. British American Tobacco confirmed that they were helping Ukraine meet legal costs in their case against Australia.\n\nBy May 2013 Cuba, Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic challenged Australia's rules through the WTO by filing requests for consultations, the first step in challenging Australia’s tobacco-labelling laws at the WTO A request for consultations opened a 60-day negotiation window after which a formal complaint could be filed which, if successful, might have led to increased tariffs on Australian exports. On 28 May 2015 Ukraine, which exports no tobacco to Australia, decided to suspend its WTO action initiated by the previous Ukrainian government. The packaging of Cuban cigars is considered to contribute significantly to sales.\n\nIn June 2018, the WTO panel rejects the claims of the plaignants. Regarding the Agreement on technical barriers to trade, the panel concludes that plain packaging restricts trade only insofar as it reduces consumption, which is the legitimate objective of the measure. As for the TRIPS Agreement, it observes that \"TRIPS does not provide for a right to use a trademark\", but prevents other companies from using them.\n\nUnder the legislation, companies have had to sell their cigarettes in a logo-free, drab dark brown packaging from 1 December 2012. Government research found that a specific olive green colour, Pantone 448 C, was the least attractive colour, particularly for young people. After concerns were expressed over the naming of the colour by the Australian Olive Association, the name was changed to drab dark brown. With the plain packaging and tax increases the Australian government aimed to bring down smoking rates from 16.6% in 2007 to less than 10% by 2018. Statistics published in 2014 showed that the amount of excise and customs duty on cigarettes fell by 3.4% in Australia in 2013 compared to 2012 when plain packaging was introduced. Some commentators referred to data provided by the tobacco industry and claimed that the tobacco sales volume had increased by 59 million sticks (individual cigarettes or their roll-your-own equivalents) during the same period. According to Philip Morris International, 2013 saw a 0.3% increase in tobacco sales compared to 2012. Other commentators however contradicted these claims based on data published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in March 2014. A study conducted by KPMG for three major cigarette manufacturers had found that illegal trade of drastically cheaper cigarettes had significantly increased, but an article in The British Medical Journal refutes this. After one year of plain cigarette packaging rule implementation, a special supplement to the British Medical Journal described that before plain packaging implementation 20% smokers want to quit, but after implementation 27% smokers want to quit. The study found that plain packaging reduces brand appeal and brand image of tobacco products. If true, this would foretell fewer new smokers taking up the habit. An analysis of Philip Morris claims that \"the data is clear that overall tobacco consumption and smoking prevalence has not gone down\" concluded that this \"claim is wrong\". A 2016 review by the Australian Government found that the current packaging regime is having a positive impact on public health in Australia.\n\nIn August 2010, Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco formed the Alliance of Australian Retailers, which commenced a multimillion-dollar campaign against the introduction of plain cigarette packaging. The campaign focused on grassroots advocacy (astroturfing), ostensibly on behalf of small business owners. When the funding source of the campaign was made public, large retailers such as Coles and Woolworths quickly withdrew support for the campaign. The tobacco companies subsequently hired a public relations firm to oversee the campaign.\n\nIn May 2011, British American Tobacco launched a media campaign suggesting that illicit trade and crime syndicates would benefit from plain packaging. BATA CEO David Crow threatened to lower cigarette prices in order to compete, which he claimed could result in higher levels of smoking amongst young people. Mr. Crow later commented he would tell his own children not to smoke cigarettes, because they are unhealthy.\n\nThe BATA campaign is largely based on a report from Deloitte. Several of the claims contained in the report related to border protection, and have since been publicly refuted by customs officials, and the report itself indicated that it had relied extensively on unaudited figures supplied by the tobacco industry itself.\n\nIn June 2011, Imperial Tobacco Australia launched a secondary media campaign, deriding plain packaging legislation as part of a Nanny state.\n\nIn June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using the provisions in a Hong Kong/Australia treaty to demand compensation for Australia's plain packaging anti-smoking legislation. As a US-based company, Philip Morris could not sue under the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The company rearranged its assets to become a Hong Kong investor in order to use the investor-state dispute settlement provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT). Immediately following the passage of legislation on 21 November 2011, Philip Morris announced it had served a notice of arbitration under Australia's Bilateral Investment Treaty with Hong Kong, seeking the suspension on the plain packaging laws and compensation for the loss of trademarks. Allens Arthur Robinson represented Philip Morris. In response, Health Minister Nicola Roxon stated that she believed the government was \"on very strong ground\" legally, and that the government was willing to defend the measures. The continuance of trade and investment proceedings on the issue has been described as an affront to the rule of law in Australia. Dr Patricia Ranald, Convener of the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network said that big tobacco and other global corporations are lobbying hard to include the right of foreign investors to sue governments in the current negotiations for a Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA). Philip Morris International lost its case in December 2015.\n\nIn November 2011, British American Tobacco announced that it would challenge the laws in the High Court as soon as they gained royal assent. In August 2012, the High Court ruled in favour of the Australian government.\n\nBritish American Tobacco placed freedom of information requests on a Cancer Institute NSW research survey of school students aged between 12-17, which asked how they react to plain packaging, where they get cigarettes from and what age they started smoking. The Cancer Council Victoria fought the FOI request, saying that the tobacco company wanted to use the survey information to change their marketing to children to increase cigarette smoking among youth.\n\nPhillip Morris was ordered to pay the Australian government's legal fees. A FOI request by Nick Xenophon and Rex Patrick revealed that Australia's legal fees amounted to $39 million with Patrick saying that this showed the dangers of investor-state dispute settlement clauses allowing companies to sue governments in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nThe World Health Organization applauded Australia’s law on plain packaging noting that “the legislation sets a new global standard for the control of a product that accounts for nearly 6 million deaths each year\".\n\nThe Cancer Council of Australia hailed the passing of the legislation, stating, \"Documents obtained from the tobacco industry show how much the tobacco companies rely on pack design to attract new smokers...You only have to look at how desperate the tobacco companies are to stop plain packaging, for confirmation that pack design is seen as critical to sales.\" The World Health Organization's director for the Western Pacific also congratulated Australia and stated that all countries and areas in the Western Pacific should follow Australia's good example.\n\nSpeaking on Radio Australia, Don Rothwell, Professor of International Law at the Australian National University, noted that Philip Morris was pursuing multiple legal avenues. The Notice of Arbitration under the bilateral investment treaty between Hong Kong and Australia has a 90-day cooling off period after which the case would most likely be sent to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington. He stated that Philip Morris was most likely aiming for the Australian Government to back down, or failing that, to sue for compensation. He said the questions to decide are whether the legislation means that Australia would acquire property by the imposition of these rules and if this legislation is a legitimate public-health measure.\n\nProfessor Rothwell noted \"...the growing recognition of the legitimacy of public health measures of this type.\" Professor Rothwell estimated that the legal cases, including any case before the High Court, would take up to a year to decide. However, in the United States, Judge Richard J. Leon ruled in 2011 that graphic health warning labels \"clearly display the government’s opinion on smoking\" which he said \"cannot constitutionally be required to appear on the merchandise of private companies.\" He ruled that these warnings would unfairly hurt their sales, that the warnings were crafted to provoke an emotional response calculated to quit smoking or never to start smoking. This, the judge ruled, was \"an objective wholly apart from disseminating purely factual and uncontroversial information.\" This finding may be appealed.\n\nThe Associated Press noted that Philip Morris took \"less than an hour\" to launch legal action against the Australian legislation. It also stated that Australian legislation followed the lead of Uruguay which requires that 80 per cent of cigarette packages is devoted to warnings and Brazil, where cigarette packages display \"graphic images\" of dead fetuses, haemorrhaging brains and gangrenous feet.\n\nGavin Allen of the \"Daily Mail\" newspaper reported that the Philip Morris lawsuit could cost the Australian government \"billions\". He also noted that the Australian law is being closely watched by other governments in Europe, Canada and New Zealand. In 2005, the World Health Organization urged countries to consider plain packaging, and noted that Bhutan had banned the sale of tobacco earlier in 2011.\n\nNew Zealand Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia congratulated the Australian Health Minister, noted that tobacco labelling rules have long been harmonised between Australia and New Zealand, and looked forward to New Zealand following suit.\n\nIn April 2011, Minister Roxon released an exposure draft of plain packaging legislation with an expected start date of 1 July 2012. Australian newspapers reported that the legislation was likely to pass despite concerns from the Opposition. It was suggested the Opposition resistance to the legislation was due to their continuing acceptance of funding donations from tobacco companies.\n\nOn 31 May 2011, Liberal leader Tony Abbott announced that his party would support the legislation, and would work with the government to ensure the legislation is effective.\n\nMinister Roxon introduced the plain packaging bill to Parliament on 6 July 2011, and it passed through the Lower House on 24 August 2011. The legislation passed the Upper House on 10 November 2011 with the amended start date of 1 December 2012. Due to the changed start date the legislation returned to the Lower House before being given royal assent. Legislation finally passed on 21 November 2011.\n\nIn March 2015, an early day motion forwarded by deputy Catherine Fonck to consider plain packaging in Belgium. However, it was opposed and stuck down by the federal Public Health select committee. Later in November 2016, the health minister Maggie De Block said she is open to idea of plain packaging, once the introduction of plain packaging in France and the UK has been reviewed. This was done on top of a list of new tobacco laws such as increasing taxes and raising the purchasing age to 18.\n\nIn 2011, Health Canada introduced changes to the tobacco products labelling regulations that included sixteen new graphic health warnings covering 75% of the principal faces of cigarette and cigarillo packages. As of September 2015, Health Canada is not planning regulatory action that would require plain or standardised packaging of tobacco products. The department considers its commitment to introduce health-related labelling requirements on cigarettes and cigarillos fulfilled.\n\nIn early-October 2015, the Liberal Political Party leader, Justin Trudeau, announced that he would include the introduction of plain tobacco packaging as part of his platform, under the heading of Healthier Kids. He has received positive feedback from cancer advocacy groups, including the Canadian Cancer Society. He has since become the Prime Minister and has told his then-Health Minister, Jane Philpott, that he expects her to \"Introduce plain packaging requirements for tobacco products, similar to those in Australia and the United Kingdom\".\n\nIn March 2015, a bill similar to the Australian one was established before the Congress of the Republic, since it was intended to regulate the packaging and labeling of tobacco products. The ultimate goal of this Bill was to achieve a total ban on its advertising, promotion and sponsorship. Although the Bill was filed a few months after the passage of the legislature, the one that has come to be debated in the first presentation in the House of Representatives allows concluding that Colombia is not far from adopting a regulation on the matter.\n\nIn 2010, the European Commission launched a public consultation on a proposal to revise Directive 2001/37/EC which covers health warnings, limits on toxic constituents, etc., for tobacco products. The consultation included a proposal to require plain packaging. Although Commissioner Dalli has rejected plain packaging as an option, the European Union included in its proposal for a new Tobacco Products Directive, which became applicable in EU countries in May 2016, the option for the Member States to introduce plain packaging. Legal scholars consider plain packaging to be consistent with primary European law and German law.\n\nThe directive adopted April 3, 2014 explicitly states that 28 EU countries have the option of implementing plain packaging, a provision upheld on May 4, 2016 by the European Court of Justice as valid when dismissing a tobacco industry legal challenge.\n\nIn December 2010, a UMP member of the French Parliament tabled a Member's Bill aimed at creating plain cigarette packaging. However, the bill did not pass despite ongoing support from health associations. As in other countries, there was fierce protest from the tobacco industry and tobacco retailers associations. The Health Minister also seemed lukewarm in his support, preferring to see the effect of newly-introduced health warnings.\n\nUnder the next legislature however, the new Socialist Health Minister, Marisol Touraine, said she would fight especially at the European level for \"neutral packaging\". As in Australia, the tobacco industry countered that generic packaging would be easy to counterfeit, which would increase illegal cigarette sales. The EU directive eventually contained no explicit measures regarding plain packaging. In reaction, the French government announced the introduction of a bill containing provisions for generic cigarette packaging on 25 September 2014. The bill was passed on 17 December 2015. The tobacco industry promptly attacked it in court, but lost its case.\nThis legislation was upheld on 21 January 2016 as constitutional by France’s Constitutional Council.\n\nCigarettes manufactured after 20 May 2016 or sold after 1 January 2017 must be put in plain packaging.\n\nThe Decree of 16 August 2016 requires that new cigarette and tobacco brands that will be introduced on the Hungarian market after 20 August 2016 has to be in a uniform plain packaging, void of brand logos. Eventually, all cigarette and tobacco products are to be sold in uniform packs from 20 May 2019.\n\nAs of July 2017, the first cigarettes with unified plain packaging hit the Hungarian market. From 20 August 2016 onwards, new brands have to be sold in plain packaging, one new cigarette brand of Von Eicken GmbH was forced to be launched with such unified package. This makes Hungary the fourth country in the world, where plain packaging is enforced; after Australia, France and the UK.\n\nAs of August 2012, India is believed to be considering plain packaging. BJD MP of Orissa, Baijayant Jay Panda, has submitted in the Lok Sabha a private members bill seeking an amendment to the anti-tobacco law aimed at increasing the size of health warning on tobacco product packets. The bill seeks amendment to the original act from 2003 to stipulate for plain packaging of cigarette and tobacco products in the country and increase the size of health warning and the accompanying graphic on cigarette packets. As of 2017, there has been no progress on this matter and tobacco continues to be sold in branded packaging.\n\nIn May 2013, Ireland announced plans to become the second country in the world to introduce plain cigarette packaging. In June 2014, the Irish government said it would legislate to implement plain packaging. Details of the bill known as the \"Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014\" were published on 10 June 2014. \"There is a wealth of international evidence on the effects of tobacco packaging in general and on perceptions and reactions to standardised packaging which support the introduction of this measure,\" Ireland's Health Minister James Reilly said when releasing details of the bill. The bill was signed by President Michael D. Higgins on 10 March 2015. After some delays, it was announced that the law would take effect on 30 September 2017, with the sale of previously-manufactured cigarettes allowed until 30 September 2018.\n\nOn 24 February 2016, the Malaysian health ministry announced that it is planning to follow Australia's example and introduce plain packaging for tobacco in the near future.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Paul Blokhuis, serving as State Secretary for Health, Welfare and Sports in the Third Rutte cabinet plans to have plain packaging law by 2020.\n\nNew Zealand requires tobacco products to be standardised in a similar manner to Australian requirements. Legislation and associated regulations to enable standardised packaging of tobacco products came into force on 14 March 2018. Distributors were given six weeks to clear old stock and following this retailers were given a further six weeks to dispose of old stock. As a result, only standardised tobacco packaging was permissible after 6 June 2018.\n\nDiscussion of the need for standardised packaging (formerly called plain packaging), the passage of the legislation through Parliament, and its subsequent coming into force took six years. In April 2012, following an inquiry by the Māori Affairs Select Committee, Government (on recommendation of the then Associate Minister of Health, Dame Tariana Turia) approved plain packaging in principle, a move that tobacco companies said they would strenuously oppose. From July to October 2012 the Ministry of Health undertook a consultation which attracted over 20,000 submissions (including overseas submissions) from public health groups and also the tobacco industry. In February 2013 Government decided to proceed with legislative change in alignment with Australia. A Bill to require the plain packaging of tobacco products – the Smoke-free Environments (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Amendment Bill – was introduced on 17 December 2013.\nThe Bill had its first reading on 11 February 2014. It was referred to the Health Committee for consideration which reported it back to Parliament with minor amendments on 11 August 2014 including a change in title from ‘Plain Packaging’ to ‘Standardised Packaging’. The Bill was stalled due to concern over legal action against the Australian government’s plain packaging regime. However, in February 2016, Prime Minister John Key commented that there was now firm legal ground for plain packaging and that the measure could become law by the end of 2016. On 30 June 2016, the Bill was given its second reading with consideration by the Committee of the Whole House on 23 August 2016 and the third and final reading on 8 September 2016.\n\nOn 31 May 2016, (World No Tobacco Day) the Associate Minister of Health, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, released a consultation document on the detail of standardised packaging requirements. An Order in Council was issued on 6 June 2017, making the Smoke-free Environments Regulations 2017 specifying detailed requirements for the standardised design of tobacco packages and products, and also specifying requirements for new and larger warning messages for tobacco packaging. These Regulations came into force on 14 March 2018 and since the 6 June 2018, only standardised packages have been allowed for sale in New Zealand.\n\nIn August 2012, it was believed that Norway began considering plain packaging. On the 31 May 2016 on World No Tobacco Day, the Health Minister Bent Høie announced the introduction of plain packaging to Norway by 2017. The plain packaging rule applies to snus as well as cigarettes.\nIn December 2016, the Norwegian Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of implementing standardised packaging for tobacco products. The measure was introduced at the same time as the EU Tobacco Products Directive measures on packaging and labelling, taking effect on 1 July 2017. Retailers were given one year (until 1 July 2018) to transition to the new standardised cigarette packages and smokeless tobacco boxes.\n\nSince 2017, the National Assembly has discussed draft Law 136 on plain packaging. The bill proposes that the color of the packs be dark matt gray and that the mark be presented in white Arial font, size 20, highlighted in bold. Panama ranks second in having the lowest prevalence in the world of consumption, since only 6.4% of adults in the isthmus smoke.\n\nAnti-smoking group New Vois Association of the Philippines favored the introduction of plain cigarette packaging in the Philippines as part of their campaign on the 2016 World No Tobacco Day and urged then-presumptive president Rodrigo Duterte to implement a law to standardize cigarette packs. The Department of Health (DOH), however, is not ready to implement plain cigarette packaging, and rather focus on enforcing graphic health warnings on cigarette packs under the Graphic Health Warning Act of 2014 that took effect in March 2016.\n\nOn the 15 February 2017, the Parliament of Slovenia passed a law for the introduction of plain packaging from 2020.\n\nOn 5 December 2014, Swiss parliamentarian Pierre-Alain Fridez tabled a motion for plain packaging in Switzerland. A few days later, the Federal Council said it was opposed to this, saying such a measure \"goes too far\".\n\nIn September 2011, \"Bloomberg\" reported that the Turkish government was working on plain packaging regulations. An Istanbul-based newspaper, \"Milliyet\", reported that under the proposal all branding elements would disappear and cigarettes would come in \"numbered black boxes\" excluding any imagery other than health warnings. In November 2016, Health Minister Recep Akdağ stated that Turkey will \"introduce plain packaging where the brand of cigarettes will almost be invisible and sellers will be obliged to store the cigarettes in closed cases instead of transparent displays\" in 2017.\n\nIn November 2013, the UK Government announced an independent review of cigarette packaging in the UK, amid calls for action to discourage young smokers. Public Health Minister Jane Ellison rejected Labour calls for immediate regulation rather than a review, saying: \"It's a year this weekend since the legislation was introduced in Australia. It's the right time to ask people to look at this.\"\n\nThe \"Plain Packs Protect\" campaign by an alliance of health organisations set out the case for tobacco plain packaging in the UK, as did Cancer Research UK's \"The Answer Is Plain\" campaign, which was launched soon after the government consultation was announced. Opposing this was the smokers' rights group FOREST, which launched a counter-campaign titled \"Hands Off Our Packs\".\n\nIn March 2015, the House of Commons voted 367–113 in favour of introducing plain cigarette packaging. Plain packaging is required for cigarettes manufactured after 20 May 2016 or sold after 21 May 2017.\n\nThe UK regulations forbid \"logos or promotional images … inserts … discounts … offers … information about nicotine, tar or carbon monoxide … lifestyle or environmental benefits [and] mentions or depictions of taste, smell or the absence thereof\", while mandating \"drab dark brown coloured packaging\", specific package shapes and a specific font (Helvetica 14-point) for brand names. The UK is also bound by the EU's Tobacco Products Directive (2014) which included a requirement for combined health warnings (picture, text and information on how to stop) covering 65 per cent of both the front and back of packaging.\n\n\nCampaigns for plain packaging\n\nCampaigns against\n\nLegislation\n\nOther\n"}

The theatre was built on the site of a panorama in 1832, and in 1882 was rebuilt by the prolific theatre architect Charles J. Phipps. It was demolished in 1905 to make way for Aldwych tube station.\n\nFrom 1801, Thomas Edward Barker set up a rival panorama to his father's in Leicester Square, at 168/169 Strand. On the death of Robert Barker, in 1806, his younger brother, Henry Aston Barker took over management of the Leicester Square rotunda. In 1816, Henry bought the panorama in the Strand, which was then known as Reinagle and Barker's Panorama, and the two panoramas were then run jointly until 1831. Their building was then used as a dissenting chapel and was purchased by Benjamin Lionel Rayner, a noted actor, in 1832.\n\nRayner engaged Charles Broad to convert and extend the original building as a theatre. This was built in 1832 in seven weeks, at a cost of £3,000. The theatre opened on 15 January 1832, as \"Rayner's New Subscription Theatre\", with a production of \"Struggles at Starting\". Within weeks, the venture failed and was sold to the actress Harriet Waylett, re-opening as \"The New Strand (Subscription) Theatre\". Again, the theatre lacked support and closed in November 1832. The theatre was re-opened in early 1833 as the \" New Strand Theatre\", by Frances Maria Kelly – who also based a drama school there. The singer, Rebecca Isaacs was the Directress of Operas at the theatre from 1852 to 1853, and again in 1855. The theatre failed because it was unlicensed, and this put it into competition with London's patent theatres. Presenting plays by subscription was one method of evading the Acts, but tickets could not be sold at the theatre. This was circumvented by selling them at neighbouring shops; and at one point the public were admitted free on purchase of an ounce of rose lozenges for four shillings (stalls), or half an ounce of peppermint drops for two shillings (the pit) from the neighbouring confectioners.\n\nThe theatre was again closed under the Patent Acts in March 1835, and the owners brought before the magistrates. It reopened on 25 April 1836, with the necessary licence, under the management of Douglas William Jerrold and William John Hammond. The theatre was enlarged in 1836 and a gallery added in 1839. In 1849 the manager was William Farren. For a while in 1851 it was owned by William Robert Copeland, and known as \"Punch's' Playhouse and Marionette Theatre\". In 1856, the manager was T. Payne.\n\nFrank Talford wrote the earliest burlesque for the Strand, full of excruciating puns and enlivened by bright songs. Mythological subjects were popular. In one such piece in 1850 the afterwards famous Mrs. Stirling played Minerva, Mrs Leigh Murray was Apollo, and Rebecca Isaacs was Venus.\n\nIn 1858, the theatre was taken over by the Swanborough family (originally Smith). Henry V. Swanborough rebuilt it at a cost of £7,000and opened it on 5 April 1858 as the \"Royal Strand Theatre\". His daughter, Louisa, was acting manager for a couple of years until her marriage to Major Lyon. Henry's eldest son William was also an active manager. Following Henry's depression and suicide in 1863, ownership passed to Henry's widow Mary Ann. Between 1868 and 1871, Eleanor Bufton (married to Arthur Swanborough) managed the Greenwich Theatre, and resources were shared between the two theatres.\n\nAccording to Erroll Sherson, writing in 1923, the Strand was burlesque's first real nursery and its permanent home. Here graduated Marie Wilton (later Lady Bancroft), Patty Oliver and Edward Terry; each would later maintain the burlesque tradition at the Prince of Wales's, The Royalty, and The Gaiety, respectively. For some years, the Strand's programme began with a short drama, many written by H. T. Craven, including, \"The Postboy\", \"Milky White\", and \"Meg's Diversion\". Then followed a burlesque by H. J. Byron, W. Brough, or F. C. Burnand.\n\nUnder the Swanboroughs, the theatre enjoyed success, with Ada Swanborough performing in H. J. Byron's burlettas and featuring a cast that included James Thorne, Edward O'Connor Terry, Miss Raynham, Mrs. Raymond, H. J. Turner and Marie Wilton. These began with \"The Lady of Lyons, or Twopenny Pride and Pennytence;\" \"Fra Diavolo Travestie, or The Prince, the Pirate and the Pearl;\" \"The Maid and the Magpie, or The Fatal Spoon\" (an early play to include a dance at the end of a song); and \"The Babes in the Wood and the Good Little Fairy Birds\".\n\nThe celebrated burlesque on \"Kenilworth\", first performed in 1859 and played over many years, brought the Strand great prosperity. It had a strong cast including Louisa Swanborough as the Earl of Leicester, H. J. Turner as Mike Lambourne, Mrs. Charles Selby as Queen Elizabeth, Marie Wilton as Sir Walter Raleigh, Patty Oliver as Amy Robsart, Charlotte Saunders as Tressillian, John Clarke as Varney and James Bland as Wayland Smith; Bland was reputed to be the king of the burlesque actors. Leicester was later played by Maria Ternan. The burlesque that lived longest in the memories of old playgoers, according to Sherson, was Brough's, \"The Field of the Cloth of Gold\".\n\nHenry Jameson Turner was by far the longest serving actor at the Strand. His first appearances pre-dated the Swanboroughs. He moved from the Lyceum to the Strand in 1849, his first wife, Eleanor, and eldest daughter, Ellen, also appearing with him. He served under both Farren and Payne, and was in the Swanborough's first production. Turner also ran a theatrical agency. His final appearance was at a benefit for the Strand General Theatrical Fund (of which he had been treasurer) in April 1882.\n\nThe first appearance of the popular pantomime character, Widow Twankey, played by James Rogers in Byron's version of \"Aladdin,\" took place at The Strand in 1861. Other successful works in the 1870s, included the hit operettas \"Madame Favart\" and \"Olivette\". It also hosted W. S. Gilbert and Frederic Clay's comic opera \"Princess Toto\" in 1876.\n\nThe theatre was rebuilt in 1865, re-opening 18 November 1865, destroyed by fire on 21 October 1866 and again rebuilt. In 1882, the theatre was condemned as having inadequate fire precautions and closed on 29 July. It was rebuilt by Charles J. Phipps, re-opening on 18 November 1882 with improved access. The cost to Mrs. Swanborough was heavy. Attempts were made to recoup the expenditure through a sale, but this was unsuccessful. Mrs Swanborough had to go through the Bankruptcy Court in 1885.\n\nSherson said that, after this, the house ceased to be the old Strand. It came under the direction of Alexander Henderson, who produced adaptations of French light opera with the best results. Though it regained a portion of its vogue under the direction of a very clever American actor, John S. Clarke, it was no longer one of the attractions of the London theatrical world. The musical comedy \"A Chinese Honeymoon\" opened in October 1901 and ran at the theatre for a record breaking 1,075 performances, until closing in 1904.\n\nIn the 16th century, Strand had hosted many grand houses by the River Thames and the area began to be built up. By the end the 18th, it had become a notorious rookery - an overcrowded slum. The area had been unaffected by the Great Fire of London and survived with narrow streets, unsuited to the new traffic. A scheme was instituted to build a new road, Kingsway between Holborn and Strand, culminating in a grand crescent, Aldwych. After many false starts, the scheme was begun in 1901 by the London County Council. To go with this a link was built to the tube station at Holborn, and in 1905 the theatre was acquired by Act of Parliament and demolished to enable Aldwych underground station to be constructed on the site. The many actors who were attached to the theatre protested against its deconstruction. The station is now closed but is said to be haunted by an angry actress who still scares people today.\n\nApart from this theatre, the Olympic, Opera Comique, Globe, Old Gaiety and many others were swept away by the scheme, they were replaced by the Gaiety, Aldwych and New Theatres, and a realignment of the Lyceum.\n\n\n"}

It is considered to be one of the most important bookbinding companies of the 20th century, famous for its luxurious jeweled bindings that used real gold and precious stones in their book covers.\n\nSangorski & Sutcliffe was established by Francis Sangorski (1875-1912) and George Sutcliffe (1878-1943). They had met in 1896 at a bookbinding evening classes taught by Douglas Cockerell at the London County Council's Central School of Arts and Crafts. In 1898, Sangorski and Sutcliffe each won one of the ten annual craft scholarship awards, giving them £20 a year for three years to continue their training as apprentice bookbinders. They were employed at Cockerell's own bindery, and began to teach bookbinding at Camberwell College of Art. They were laid off in 1901 after a coal strike caused an economic slump, and they decided to set up on their own in a rented attic in Bloomsbury, starting on 1 October 1901. They soon moved to Vernon Place, and then, in 1905, to Southampton Row.\n\nSangorski's elder brother, Alberto Sangorski, worked for the firm. He became an accomplished calligrapher and illuminator, working for Rivière from 1910.\n\nThey quickly revived the art of jewelled bookbindings, decorating their sumptuous multi-colour leather book bindings with gold inlay and precious and semi-precious jewels. They were commissioned to create a most luxurious binding of the \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\", the front cover of which was adorned with three golden peacocks with jewelled tails and surrounded by heavily tooled and gilded vines, that was sent on the ill-fated RMS \"Titanic\" in 1912. The book, known as the Great Omar, sank with the ship and has not been recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sangorski drowned.\n\nSutcliffe continued the firm, which became recognised as one of the leading bookbinders in London. The bindery moved to Poland Street, and managed to survive through the First World War, the Great Depression, the Second World War, and post-war austerity. In this period, it undertook work for the Ashendene Press, Golden Cockerel Press and the J. & E. Bumpus bookshop. It also created miniature books for Queen Mary's Dolls' House.\n\nAfter Sutcliffe suffered a stroke in 1936, he entrusted the business to his nephew, Stanley Bray (1907-1995), who had worked for his uncle since 1926. The company merged with HT Woods in 1939, bringing Kenneth Hobson to the firm. He introduced a more modern style of binding. Bray inherited the company on Sutcliffe's death. The firm merged again in 1988, joining with Zaehnsdorf's bindery in Bermondsey (established by Joseph Zaehnsdorf in 1842). The combined business was bought by Asprey in 1985 and renamed SSZ Limited. Shepherds, a bookbinding company, bought the company from Asprey in 1998, and revived the Sangorski & Sutcliffe name. The bindery recently moved from its premises in Bermondsey to Rochester Row.\n\nA second copy of the Omar Khayyam was bound as World War II broke out and this was placed in a bank safe vault for safe keeping, but enemy bombing destroyed the vault and the second copy. Stanley Bray after his retirement made a Third version of the binding using the original design, this is now in the British Library.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29002354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29002354", "title": "Sigmund Freud's views on religion", "text": "Sigmund Freud's views on religion\n\nSigmund Freud's views on religion are described in several of his books and essays. Freud regarded God as an illusion, based on the infantile need for a powerful father figure; religion, necessary to help us restrain violent impulses earlier in the development of civilization, can now be set aside in favor of reason and science.\n\nIn \"An Autobiographical Study\", originally published in 1925, Freud recounts that \"My parents were Jews, and I have remained a Jew myself.\" Familiarity with Bible stories, from an age even before he learned to read, had \"an enduring effect on the direction of my interest.\" In 1873, upon attending the University at Vienna, he first encountered antisemitism: \"I found that I was expected to feel myself inferior and an alien because I was a Jew.\"\n\nIn a prefatory note to the Hebrew translation of \"Totem and Taboo\" (1930) Freud describes himself as \"an author who is ignorant of the language of holy writ, who is completely estranged from the religion of his fathers—as well as from every other religion\" but who remains \"in his essential nature a Jew and who has no desire to alter that nature\".\n\nIn \"Obsessive Actions and Religious Practices\" (1907), his earliest writing about religion, Freud suggests that religion and neurosis are similar products of the human mind: neurosis, with its compulsive behavior, is \"an individual religiosity\", and religion, with its repetitive rituals, is a \"universal obsessional neurosis.\"\n\nIn \"Totem and Taboo\", published in 1913, Freud analyzes the tendency of primitive tribes to promulgate rules against incest within groups named for totem animal and objects, and to create taboos regarding actions, people and things. He notes that taboos (such as that regarding incest) still play a significant role in modern society but that totemism \"has long been abandoned as an actuality and replaced by newer forms\". Freud believes that an original act of patricide—the killing and devouring of \"the violent primal father\" was remembered and re-enacted as a \"totem meal...mankind's earliest festival\" which was \"the beginning of so many things—of social organization, of moral restrictions and of religion\". Freud develops this idea further in \"Moses and Monotheism\", his last book, discussed below. He further goes to attribute creation of gods to humans: \"...we know that, like gods, [demons] are only the product of the psychic powers of man; they have been created from and out of something.\"\n\nIn \"An Autobiographical Study\" Freud elaborated on the core idea of \"Totem and Taboo\": \"This view of religion throws a particularly clear light upon the psychological basis of Christianity, in which, it may be added, the ceremony of the totem-feast still survives with but little distortion in the form of Communion.\"\n\nIn \"The Future of an Illusion\" (1927), Freud refers to religion as an illusion which is \"perhaps the most important item in the psychical inventory of a civilization\". In his estimation, religion provides for defense against \"the crushingly superior force of nature\" and \"the urge to rectify the shortcomings of civilization which made themselves painfully felt\". He concludes that all religious beliefs are \"illusions and insusceptible of proof.\"\n\nFreud then examines the issue of whether, without religion, people will feel \"exempt from all obligation to obey the precepts of civilization\". He notes that \"civilization has little to fear from educated people and brain-workers\" in whom secular motives for morality replace religious ones; but he acknowledges the existence of \"the great mass of the uneducated and oppressed\" who may commit murder if not told that God forbids it, and who must be \"held down most severely\" unless \"the relationship between civilization and religion\" undergoes \"a fundamental revision\".\n\nFreud asserts that dogmatic religious training contributes to a weakness of intellect by foreclosing lines of inquiry. He argues that \"[I]n the long run nothing can withstand reason and experience, and the contradiction which religion offers to both is all too palpable.\" The book expressed Freud's \"hope that in the future science will go beyond religion, and reason will replace faith in God.\"\n\nIn an afterword to \"An Autobiographical Study\" (1925, revised 1935), Freud states that his \"essentially negative\" view of religion changed somewhat after \"The Future of an Illusion\"; while religion's \"power lies in the truth which it contains, I showed that that truth was not a material but a historical truth.\"\n\nHarold Bloom calls \"The Future of an Illusion\", \"one of the great failures of religious criticism.\" Bloom believes that Freud underestimated religion, and that as a result his criticisms of it were no more convincing than T. S. Eliot's criticisms of psychoanalysis. Bloom suggests that psychoanalysis and Christianity are both interpretations of the world and of human nature, and that while Freud believed that religious beliefs are illusions and delusions, the same may be said of psychoanalytic theory. In his view nothing is accomplished with regard to either Christianity or psychoanalysis by listing their illusions and delusions.\n\nIn \"Civilization and its Discontents\", published in 1930, Freud says that man's need for religion could be explained by \"a sensation of 'eternity', a feeling as of something limitless, unbounded—as it were, 'oceanic'\", and adds, \"I cannot discover this 'oceanic' feeling in myself\". Freud suggests that the \"oceanic feeling\", which his friend Romain Rolland had described to him in a letter, is a wish fulfillment, related to the child's egoistic need for protection.\n\nJames Strachey, editor and translator of this and other works of Freud, describes the main theme of the work as \"the irremediable antagonism between the demands of instinct and the restrictions of civilization\". Freud also treats two other themes, the development of civilization recapitulating individual development, and the personal and social struggle between \"Eros\" and \"Thanatos\", life and death urges.\n\nFreud expresses deep pessimism about the odds of humanity's reason triumphing over its destructive forces. He added a final sentence to the book in a 1931 edition, when the threat of Hitler was already becoming apparent: \"But who can foresee with what success and with what result?\"\n\nAtheist political philosopher Christopher Hitchens cited this book as a reason behind Freud being one of his most influential figures. Hitchens described the book as a \"pessimistic unillusioned tale of realism,\" noting that Freud \"wasted little time in identifying [the need for religion] as infantile\" and pointing out a summary by Freud's biographer Ernest Jones that \"Human happiness, therefore, does not seem to be the purpose of the universe.\" \n\n\"Moses and Monotheism\" was Freud's last book, published in 1939, the year of his death. In it, Freud makes certain guesses and assumptions about Moses as a historical figure, particularly that he was not born Jewish but was adopted by Jews (the opposite of the Biblical story) and that he was murdered by his followers, who then via reaction formation revered him and became irrevocably committed to the monotheistic idea he represented.\n\nMark Edmundson comments that in writing \"Moses and Monotheism\", Freud, while not abandoning his atheism, perceived for the first time a value in the abstract form of monotheism—the worship of an invisible God, without Jesus or saints—practiced by the Jews.\n\nIn \"Moses and Monotheism\", Freud proposed that Moses had been a priest of Akhenaten who fled Egypt after the pharaoh's death and perpetuated monotheism through a different religion.\n\nAccording to Jay Geller, \"Moses and Monotheism\" is full of \"false starts, deferred conclusions, repetitions, rationalizations, defensive self-justifications, questionable methods, and weak arguments that are readily acknowledged as such by Freud.\"\n\nThe later developments in Freud’s views on religion are summarized in his lecture on the Question of a Weltanschauung, Vienna, 1932. There he describes the struggles of science in its relations with three other powers: art, philosophy and religion.\nArt is an illusion of some sort and a long story. Philosophy goes astray in its method. Religion constructed a consistent and self-contained \"Weltanschauung\" to an unparalleled degree. By comparison science is marked by certain negative characteristics. Among them it asserts that there are no sources of knowledge of the universe other than the intellectual working over of carefully scrutinized observations, and none that is derived from revelation, intuition or divination.\n\nOn relations between science and philosophy and science and religion Freud has this much to say in one sentence: “It is not permissible to declare that science is one field of human mental activity and that religion and philosophy are others, at least equal in value, and that science has no business to interfere with the other two: that they all have an equal claim to be true and that everyone is at liberty to choose from which he will draw his convictions and in which he will place his belief.” Then he goes on to say that such an impermissible view is regarded as superior and tolerant, but that it is not tenable, that it shares all the pernicious features of an entirely unscientific Weltanschauung and that it is equivalent to one in practice.\n\nWith respect to religion in particular he explains that a religious person had once been feeble and helpless. A parent had protected him. Later such a person gets more insight into the perils of life and he rightly concludes that fundamentally he still remains just as helpless as he was in his childhood.\n\nThen he harks back to the mnemic image.\n\nIn a 1949 essay in \"Commentary\" magazine, Irving Kristol says that Freud exposed what he believed to be the irrationality of religion without evidence, but has not substituted anything beyond \"a mythology of rational despair\".\n\nIn a 1950 book entitled \"Christianity and Freud\", Benjamin Gilbert Sanders draws parallels between the theory of psychoanalysis and Christian religion, referring to Jesus Christ as \"the Great Psychiatrist\" and Christians' love for Christ as \"a more positive form of the Transference.\"\n\nKaren Armstrong notes in \"A History of God\" that \"not all psychoanalysts agreed with Freud's view of God,\" citing Alfred Adler, who believed God was a projection which had been \"helpful to humanity\", and C.G. Jung, who, when asked whether he believed in God, said \"Difficult to answer, I know. I don't need to believe. I know.\"\n\nTony Campolo, founder of the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education, observes that \"With Freud, God, and the need for God-dictated restraints, had been abolished,\" resulting in an increase in social chaos and unhappiness which could have been avoided by adherence to religion.\n\nA number of critics draw the parallel between religious beliefs and Freud's theories, that neither can be scientifically proven, but only experienced subjectively. Lee Siegel writes that \"you either grasp the reality of Freud's dynamic notion of the subconscious intuitively – the way, in fact, you do or do not grasp the truthfulness of Ecclesiastes – or you cannot accept that it exists.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1742172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1742172", "title": "Société des Artistes Indépendants", "text": "Société des Artistes Indépendants\n\nThe Société des Artistes Indépendants (\"Society of Independent Artists\"), Salon des Indépendants was formed in Paris on 29 July 1884. The association began with the organization of massive exhibitions in Paris, choosing the slogan \"sans jury ni récompense\" (\"without jury nor reward\"). Albert Dubois-Pillet, Odilon Redon, Georges Seurat and Paul Signac were among its founders. For the following three decades their annual exhibitions set the trends in art of the early 20th century, along with the Salon d'Automne. This is where artworks were often first displayed and widely discussed. World War I brought a closure to the salon, though the \"Artistes Indépendants\" remained active. Since 1920, the headquarters is located in the vast basements of the Grand Palais (next door to the \"Société des Artistes Français\", the \"Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts\", the Société du Salon d'Automne, and others).\n\nThe Salon des Indépendants (Salon des Artistes Indépendants) is an annual independent art exhibition aimed at a large audience that takes place in Paris. It was established in response to the rigid traditionalism of the official government-sponsored Salon. Since the first exhibition of 1884, at the Pavilion de la ville de Paris (Champs-Élysées), the organizing Société des Artistes Indépendants has vowed to bring together the works of artists claiming a certain independence in their art. The event is characterized by the absence of both awards and a selection jury. There are however placement or hanging committees. In contrast to the Salon d'Automne, which takes place in Paris during autumn months, the Indépendants is held during the springtime, inspiring artistic production during winter months, as artists prepare for the show. Several important dates have marked the history of the salon.\n\nDuring the Second Empire, artists not backed by the official \"Académie de peinture et de sculpture\" in charge of the exhibits at the annual \"Salon\" or without support supplied by actual political constellations had little chance to advance. From year to year the number of artists working in Paris, the number of artists submitting works to the official \"Salon\" and the number of works refused by the jury increased, but neither the Second Empire nor the Third Republic found an answer to this situation.\n\nFor years, the artists had counted on official support. In 1884, finally, the artists began to organise themselves, and a \"Group of independent artists\" was authorised by the Ministry of Fine Arts to arrange an exhibition, while the City of Paris agreed to supply rooms for the presentation. So, from May 15 through July 15, the first \"free\" exhibition of contemporary art showed more than 5000 works by more than 400 artists.\n\nAlthough sustained by Mesureur, deputy chairman of the Council of Paris and Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of France, by Frédéric Hattat, chairman of the Fine Art commission in the same council, by Albert Dubois-Pillet, commanding the Republican Guard, member of the Grand Orient de France, the beginning of the Company, considered as a nest of revolutionaries, were difficult.\n\nJune 11, 1884, Maître Coursault, notary at Montmorency, Val-d'Oise, officially confirmed the establishment of the \"Société\"\n\nArticle 1 of the organization's statutes reads,\n\nMembers of the \"Groupe\" challenged this foundation and succeeded to have an exhibition arranged \"for the victims of the recent cholera epidemic\", inaugurated December 1, 1884, by Lucien Boué, President of the Paris City Council. But financially the result was a catastrophe. Nevertheless, in spring 1885, the \"Groupe\" organised its next exhibition, this time with some success.\n\nThe Salon des Indépendants arose through the need by artists to present their works to the general public independently, rather than through the official selective method of the \"Salon\" (created by Louis XIV). A small collective of innovative artists—Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Camille Pissarro along with Albert Dubois-Pillet, Odilon Redon, Georges Seurat, Paul Signac—created the Salon des Indépendants. The right to present their works to the public with no restrictions was their only condition. Article no. 1 of the By-laws of the organization: \"The purpose of Société des Artistes Indépendants—based on the principle of abolishing admission jury—is to allow the artists to present their works to public judgement with complete freedom\".\n\nOn 1 December 1884, Lucien Boué, President of the Paris City Council, opened the first Salon des Artistes Indépendants at the Palais Polychrome (near the Palais de l'Industrie). The Salon became the refuge for artworks deemed unacceptable by the traditional Salon. Among the works exhibited were Seurat's \"La baignade à Asnières\" Signac's \"Le Pont d'Austerlitz\", and works of Henri-Edmond Cross, Odilon Redon, Albert Dubois-Pillet, Louis Valtat, Armand Guillaumin, Charles Angrand, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Vincent van Gogh.\n\nThe proceeds of the first show were earmarked for the victims of cholera. The second exhibition was held in 1886 in a temporary building in the Tuileries Garden with 200 paintings exhibited. By 1905 Henri Rousseau, Pierre Bonnard, Jean Metzinger and Henri Matisse had exhibited there. During the period between 1890 and 1914 known as \"La Belle Époque\" practically all of the artists associated with modernism and the avant-garde exhibited at the Indépendants. The works exhibited ranged in style from Realist to post-Impressionist, Nabis, Symbolist, Neo-impressionist/Divisionist, Fauve, Expressionist, Cubist and Abstract art.\n\nThe submission payment was 10 francs for four works. In 1906 ten works could be submitted for 25 francs and from 1909 only two. In 1901 more than thousand paintings were shown. 2,395 works were exhibited in 1904, and 1905, 4,269 works by 669 artists. By 1908 six thousand works were displayed at the Indépendants. In 1910 the number of artists increased to 1,182, rising progressively to 2,175 by 1930. In 1926 the critic Louis Vauxcelles estimated that only 100 of the 3,726 artworks were of any value.\n\nIn 1895 and 1897 the Salon des Indépendants was held at the (Champ de Mars). Between 1901 and 1907, the exhibition was held in the Grandes Serres de la Ville de Paris (Cours-la-Reine, Paris), also called \"Grande Serre de l'Alma\", built for the Exposition Universelle of 1900. From 1920 the exhibitions were held at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées in Paris.\n\nIn 1902 the Indépendants featured a retrospective of works by Toulouse-Lautrec. Jean Metzinger sent three paintings to the Salon des Indépendants in 1903, and subsequently moved to Paris with the proceeds from their sale. He again exhibiting several paintings, this time along with Robert Delaunay, at the Indépendants of 1904, where Cross presented his Venice series. In 1905 the salon featured retrospectives of works by Seurat and Vincent van Gogh.\n\nFrom 24 March to 30 April, the burgeoning of Fauvism was visible at the Indépendants, prior to the infamous Salon d'Automne exhibition of 1905 which historically marks the birth of the term Fauvism, after critic Louis Vauxcelles described their show of work with the phrase \"Donatello chez les fauves\" (\"Donatello among the wild beasts\"), contrasting the paintings with a Renaissance-style sculpture that shared the room with them.\n\nAt the 1905 Indépendants Henri Matisse exhibited with Albert Marquet, Jean Puy, Henri Manguin, Othon Friesz, Raoul Dufy, Kees van Dongen, André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, Charles Camoin and Jean Metzinger. This exhibition was reviewed by Vauxcelles in Gil Blas on 4, 18 and 23 March 1905.\n\nMatisse exhibited the proto-Fauve painting \"Luxe, Calme et Volupté\". In the Divisionist technique and brightly colored, it was painted in 1904, after a summer spent working in St. Tropez on the French Riviera alongside the neo-Impressionist painters Paul Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross. The painting is Matisse's most important work in which he used the Divisionist technique advocated by Signac, which Matisse had first adopted after reading Signac's essay, \"D'Eugène Delacroix au Néo-impressionisme\" in 1898. Signac purchased the work after the 1905 Salon des Indépendants.\n\nMatisse is in charge of the hanging committee, assisted by Metzinger, Bonnard, Camoin, Laprade Luce, Manguin, Marquet, Puy and Vallotton.\n\nAt the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 the elected members of the hanging committee included Matisse, Signac and Metzinger. Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which marked the beginning of Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental \"Le Bonheur de Vivre (The Joy of Life)\". The triangular composition is closely related to Cézanne's Bathers; a series that would soon become a source of inspiration for Picasso's \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\". Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of \"Le Bonheur de Vivre\".\n\nAccording to Metzinger's memoirs, it was at the 1906 Salon des Indépendants that he met Albert Gleizes and visited his studio in Courbevoie several days later. In 1907, at Max Jacob's place, Metzinger met Guillaume Krotowsky, who already signed his works Guillaume Apollinaire.\n\nIn 1906 Metzinger had acquired enough prestige to be elected to the hanging committee of the Salon des Indépendants, in addition to his entry of eight works. He formed a close friendship at this time with Robert Delaunay, with whom he would share an exhibition at Berthe Weill's gallery early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by one critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.\n\nIn the spring of 1906 Georges Braque exhibited his works for the first time at the Salon des Indépendants. At the exhibition of 1907, held from 20 March to 30 April, six paintings by Braque were exhibited. Five were purchased directly at the Salon des Indépendants by the art dealer Wilhelm Uhde for a total price of 505 FF. The sixth work was presumably bought by the art dealer Kahnweiler. It was around this time that Braque first met Kahnweiler and was introduced to Picasso by Guillaume Apollinaire. Braque's works were still Fauve in nature. It wasn't until the autumn of 1907 at L’Estaque that Braque began his transition away from bright hues to more subdued colors, possibly as a result of the memorial exhibition of Cézanne’s work at the Salon d'Automne of 1907.\nAndré Derain exhibited his \"Dancer at Le Rat Mort\", painted during the winter of 1906, and his large \"Bathers\" (Museum of Modern Art, New York) of early 1907. No longer truly Fauve, this work is close to Cézanne in its angular form and tonal modeling.\nMatisse's \"Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)\" also appeared at the 1907 Indépendants, entitled \"Tableau no. III\". Vauxcelles writes on the topic of \"Nu bleu\":\n\nI admit to not understanding. An ugly nude woman is stretched out upon grass of an opaque blue under the palm trees... This is an artistic effect tending toward the abstract that escapes me completely. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 March 1907)\n\n\"Blue Nude\" would later create a sensation at the Armory Show of 1913 in New York City. The painting, already a certain distance from Fauvism, was deemed so ugly students burned it in effigy at the 1913 Armory Show in Chicago, where it had toured from New York.\n\nIn addition to the works of Matisse, Derain and Braque, the Indépendants of 1907 included six works (each) by Vlaminck, Dufy, Metzinger, Delaunay, Camoin, Herbin, Puy, and Valtat, and three by Marquet.\n\nVaucelles described this group of 'Fauves':\n\nA movement I consider dangerous (despite the great sympathy I have for its perpetrators) is taking shape among a small clan of youngsters. A chapel has been established, two haughty priests officiating. MM Derain and Matisse; a few dozen innocent catechumens have received their baptism. Their dogma amounts to a wavering schematicism that proscribes modeling and volumes in the name of I-don't-know-what pictorial abstraction. This new religion hardly appeals to me. I don't believe in this Renaissance... M. Matisse, fauve-in-chief; M. Derain, fauve deputy; MM. Othon Friesz and Dufy, fauves in attendance... and M. Delaunay (a fourteen-year-old-pupil of M. Metzinger...), infantile fauvelet. (Vauxcelles, Gil Blas, 20 March 1907)\nThe Fauvism of Matisse and Derain was virtually over by the spring of the 1907 Indépendants. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.\n\nMany of Cézanne's paintings had been exhibited at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, 1905 and 1906. After Cézanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in the form of a retrospective at the Salon d'Automne of 1907, greatly attracting interest and affecting the direction taken by the avant-garde artists in Paris prior to the advent of Cubism. Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired not just Matisse, Derain, Braque and Metzinger, but the other artists who exhibited earlier with the Fauves. Those who had not transited through a Fauve stage, such as Picasso, experimented, too, with the complex fracturing of form. Cézanne had thus sparked a wholesale transformation in the area of artistic investigation that would profoundly affect the development modern art of the 20th century.\n\nSignac becomes president of the 24th Salon des Indépendants. At the exhibition of 1908, held 20 March through 2 May, a painting by Braque strikes Apollinaire by its originality. Though not listed in the catalog, it was described in \"L'Intransigeant\". In his review published in \"La Revue des lettres et des arts\" (1 May 1908) Apollinaire claims that Braque's work is the most original effort presented at the salon. Even in the absence of Matisse and Picasso, Vauxcelles, in Gil Blas (20 March 1908) refers to the most innovative artists of the exposition as 'barbarous schematizers'... who want to create an 'abstract art'.\n\nThis exhibition was reviewed in the \"New York Herald\" 20 March 1908; by Vauxcelles in \"Gil Blas\" 20 March 1908; by C. Le Senne in \"Le Courrier du Soir\", 22 March 1908; and by Maurice Denis, in \"La Grande revue\", 10 April 1908.\n\nIn excess of 1,314 artists exhibit 6,701 works. Matisse does not submit any works.\n\nAfter this salon, the writer Gelett Burgess begins a series of interviews with the avant-garde working currently in Paris and surrounding banlieues. These interviews and Burgess' impressions of the works produced are published in \"Architectural Record\", May 1910, at the heart of the proto-Cubist period.\n\nGelett Burgess writes in \"The Wild Men of Paris\":\n\n\"Though the school was new to me, it was already an old story in Paris. It had been a nine-days’ wonder. Violent discussions had raged over it; it had taken its place as a revolt and held it, despite the fulmination of critics and the contempt of academicians. The school was increasing in numbers, in importance. By many it was taken seriously. At first, the beginners had been called \"The Invertebrates.\" In the Salon of 1905 they were named \"The Incoherents.\" But by 1906, when they grew more perfervid, more audacious, more crazed with theories, they received their present appellation of \"Les Fauves\"—the Wild Beasts. And so, and so, a-hunting I would go!\"<br><br>\n\n\"It was Matisse who took the first step into the undiscovered land of the ugly. Matisse himself, serious, plaintive, a conscientious experimenter, whose works are but studies in expression, who is concerned at present with but the working out of the theory of simplicity, denies all responsibility for the excesses of his unwelcome disciples.\"<br><br>\n\n\"Picasso, keen as a whip, spirited as a devil, mad as a hatter, runs to his studio and contrives a huge nude woman composed entirely of triangles, and presents it in triumph. What wonder Matisse shakes his head and does not smile! He chats thoughtfully of the \"Harmony and volume\" and \"architectural values,\" and wild Braque climbs to his attic and builds an architectural monster which he names Woman, with balanced masses and parts, with openings and columnar legs and cornices. Matisse praises the direct appeal to instinct of the African wood images, and even a sober Dérain, a co-experimenter, loses his head, moulds a neolithic man into a solid cube, creates a woman of spheres, stretches a cat out into a cylinder, and paints it red and yellow!\"<br><br>\n\n\"Metzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color.\"\n\nAccording to John Golding's influential history of Cubism published in 1959, it was at the Salon des Indépendants of 1909, held 25 March through 2 May, that one of the first Cubist painting was exhibited to the public: \"Little Harbor in Normandy (Petit port en Normandie)\", no. 215, entitled \"Paysage\", by Georges Braque (Art Institute of Chicago). On 25 March 1909, Louis Vauxcelles qualifies the works of Braque (Bracke, sic) exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants as \"bizarreries cubiques\" (cubic oddities). In Room 16 hung works by Derain, Dufy, Friesz, Laprade, Matisse, Jean Puy, Rouault and Vlaminck.\n\nThe evolution towards a more linear style with simplified forms continues with greater emphasis on clear geometric principles (derived from Cézanne) not solely visible in the works of Braque, but too in the works of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay (Picasso being absent from the salons).\n\nGleizes exhibits in the Salon des Indépendants for the first time: \"Portrait de René Arcos\" and \"L'Arbre\", two paintings in which the emphasis on simplified geometric form overwhelms to a large extent the representational interest of the painting. The same tendency is evident in Metzinger's \"Portrait of Apollinaire\" exhibited in the same salon. According to Apollinaire this was the 'first Cubist portrait'. Apollinaire himself has pointed out in his book \"The Cubist Painters\" (1913), that Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist.\nAccording to Gleizes's memoirs, Alexandre Mercereau introduces him to Metzinger, but only after the Salon d'Automne do they become seriously interested in each other's work.\n\nLouis Vauxcelles, in his review of the 26th Salon des Indépendants (1910), made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as \"ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes.\"\n\nThe work of Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Robert Delaunay were exhibited together. Le Fauconnier showed the geometrically simplified \"Ploumanac'h\" landscapes: \"Le Ravin\" and \"Village dans les Montagne\", along with \"Femme à l'éventail\" and \"Portrait of Maroussia\". In the same hall hung the works of Matisse, Vlaminck, Dufy, Laurencin, van Dongen and Henri Rousseau.\nApollinaire wrote in the daily newspaper \"L'Intransigeant\", which had a circulation of about 50,000, about the exhibition that consisted of close to 6000 paintings.\n\nRemarkably, even the presence of a painting made by a donkey named Lolo passed by practically unnoticed. The painting was entitled \"\" presented by the artist , the 'excessivist' from Genoa was exhibited at the 1910 Salon des Indépendants. Boronali was in fact the Parisian donkey (Lolo), who made the painting with his tail. (Cf. Warnod, 1910; Weiss, 1994, pp. 149–151, 304.) It is suspected that Lolo belonged to Frédéric Gérard (« le père Frédé »), owner of the cabaret Lapin Agile in la butte Montmartre. Roland Dorgelès and two friends, et Jules Depaquit, attached a paint brush to the tail of the animal. The donkey did the rest. The painting sold for 400FF (equal to 1,257 Euros today) and was donated by Dorgelès to the \"Orphelinat des Arts\". The painting forms part of the permanent collection at \"l'Espace culturel Paul Bédu\" (Milly-la-Forêt).\n\nThe newly formed Montparnasse group (who held meetings not just at Le Fauconnier's studio, but at the cafés \"Le Dôme, , , Le Select\", and \"Café de la Rotonde\") together with other young painters who also want to emphasise a research into form (as opposed to color) take over the hanging committee of the Salon des Indépendants ensuring that the works of painters now dubbed 'Cubists' would be shown together. Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and Marie Laurencin (at the request of Apollinaire) are shown together in Room 41.\n\nThe result of the group show is a major scandal. Even though the pictures shown are still conventional representations that generally observe the rules of classical perspective (according to Gleizes), the public is outraged by the representation of subject matter as cones, cubes and spheres, resulting in the obscurity of the subject matter. The predominance of sharp geometrical faceting and the fact that a group of artists are all working in similar directions, gives rise to the term 'Cubism'. Although this and similar terms have been used before in artistic circles (usually in relation to the works of Metzinger, Delaunay and Braque), this is the first time the use of the term becomes widespread.\n\nThe term 'Cubism' is employed in June 1911 by Apollinaire, speaking in the context of an exhibition in Brussels which includes works by Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger, and Le Fauconnier. During the summer, Gleizes is in close contact with Metzinger, who has recently moved to Meudon. Both are discontent with the conventional perspective mechanism. They have long conversations about the nature of form and perception. They agree that traditional painting gives a static and incomplete idea of the subject as experienced in life. Things, they conclude, are in fact dynamic, observed to move, are seen from different angles and can be captured at successive moments in time.\n\nAnother Cubist scandal is produced several months later at the Salon d'Automne, where the Indépendants exhibitors develop relations with the Duchamp brothers, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp. The studios of Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon at 7, rue Lemaître, become, together with Gleizes' studio at Courbevoie, regular meeting places for the newly formed \"Groupe de Puteaux\" (soon to exhibit under the name Section d'Or). František Kupka, the Czech painter interested in non-representational painting based on analogies with music and the progressive abstraction of a subject in motion, joins the discussions.\n\nIn the spring of 1911 the cubists made sure they were shown together, infiltrating the placement committee. That Le Fauconnier was the secretary of the salon facilitated the goal of hanging their works together. Until then, works in alphabetical order of the artists names. In room 41 hung works by Metzinger, Gleizes, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. In room 43 hung works by André Lhote, Roger de La Fresnaye, André Dunoyer de Segonzac, Luc-Albert Moreau and André Mare.\n\nThis exhibition involved more than 6,400 paintings. In room 42 was a retrospective exhibition of Henri (Le Douanier) Rousseau, who died 2 September 1910. Articles and reviews were numerous and extensive in sheer words employed; including in Gil Blas, Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, L'Oeuvre, and Cri de Paris. Apollinaire wrote a long review in the 20 April 1911 issue of L'Intransigeant.\n\nHenri Le Fauconnier's \"Abundance\", 1910-11 (Haags Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag), partly due to its large size and partly to the treatment of its subject matter, was an eye-catcher, causing a sensation. This painting was soon bought by the Dutchman art critic and painter Conrad Kickert (1882-1965), who was secretary of the Contemporary Art Society (). In 1934 he donated the painting to the Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag.\n\nThe Salon des Indépendants transpired in Paris from 20 March to 16 May 1912. This massive exhibition occurred exactly one year after Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and Laurencin were shown together in Room 41 of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, which provoked the scandal out of which Cubism emerged and spread throughout Paris. Its wide-ranging repercussions were felt in Germany, Holland, Italy, Russia, Spain and elsewhere (influencing Futurism, Suprematism, Constructivism, De Stijl and so on). Just five months prior to this show another polemic developed at the Salon d'Automne of 1912. Originating in \"Salle XI\" where the Cubists exhibited their works, this quarrel involved both the French and non-French avant-garde artists. On 3 December 1912 the polemic reached the Chambre des députés and was debated at the \"Assemblée Nationale\". At stake was more than just the future of public funding for exhibitions that included Cubist art. Le Fauconnier, Gleizes, Léger, Metzinger and Archipenko formed the core of the hanging committee at the 1912 Indépendants. The common hall, room 20, in which the Cubists placed themselves became the nucleus of the exhibition.c\n\nAt the 1912 Salon des Indépendants Albert Gleizes exhibited \"Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)\" (no. 1347) — Marcel Duchamp's \"Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2\" was listed in the catalogue (n. 1001) but was withdrawn prior to the exhibition — Roger de La Fresnaye exhibited \"Artillerie\" (no. 1235) — Robert Delaunay showed his monumental \"Ville de Paris\" (no. 868) — Jean Metzinger exhibited \"La Femme au Cheval (Woman with a horse)\" and \"Le Port\" — Fernand Léger showed \"La Noce\" — Henri Le Fauconnier, \"Le Chasseur (The Huntsman)\" — and the newcomer Juan Gris exhibited his \"Portrait of Picasso\".\n\nThe art critic Olivier-Hourcade writes of this exhibition in 1912 and its relation to the creation of a new French school: 'Metzinger with his \"Port\", Delaunay with \"Paris\", Gleizes with his \"Baigneuses, are close to this real and magnificent result, this victory comes from several centuries: the creation of a school of painting, 'French' and absolutely independent.\n\n's reviewed the 1912 Salon des Indépendants in the March–April 1912 issue of La Revue de France et des Pays, noting Metzinger's 'refined choice of colors' and the 'precious rarity' of the painting's 'matière'. André Salmon too, in his review, noted Metzinger's 'refined use of color' in \"La Femme au Cheval\" and praised its 'French grace', while noting Metzinger 'illuminated a cubist figure with the virtues of a smile'.\n\nGleizes, on the other hand, would write in 1913 of the Cubist movements continual evolution:\nAnd regarding the reception received by the Cubists at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne Gleizes writes:\n\nThe Salon des Indépendants was held March 9 through 18 May, the Cubist works were shown in room 46. Jean Metzinger exhibited his large \"L'Oiseau bleu\" — Albert Gleizes, Albert Gleizes. \"Les Joueurs de football (Football Players)\" 1912-13, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C — Robert Delaunay \"The Cardiff Team (L'équipe de Cardiff )\" 1913, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven — Fernand Léger, \"Le modèle nu dans l'atelier (Nude Model In The Studio)\" 1912-13, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York — Juan Gris, \"L'Homme dans le Café (Man in Café)\" 1912, Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nIn room 45 hung the works of Robert Delaunay, Sonia Delaunay, František Kupka, Morgan Russell and Macdonald-Wright. This was the first exhibition where Orphism and Synchromism were emphatically present. Apollinaire in \"L'Intransigeant\" mentioned la Salle hollandaise (room 43), which included Jacoba van Heemskerck, Piet Mondrian, Otto van Rees, Jan Sluyters en Leo Gestel and Lodewijk Schelfhout.\n\nThe 1914 exhibition, held from 1 March to 30 April, was composed of many Orphist works of large dimension and took place in one of the largest rooms on the ground floor: Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Patrick Henry Bruce and Arthur Burdett Frost were largely represented.\n\nDuring the First World War there were no exhibitions. After the war, however, there was a revival of Cubism, led by Gleizes and others, which included exhibitions at Léonce Rosenberg's \"Galerie l'Effort Moderne\" and a revival of the Salon de la Section d'Or.\n\nIn an attempt to regain their pre-war status at the forefront of the avant-garde, and faced with the possibility of being overthrown by Dada, the cubists regrouped. Their first chance to exhibit together presented itself at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. But the fight wasn't going to be easy. Opening on 28 January, over three thousand works were display, a large number of which were Cubist paintings. For the first time the exhibition took place at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées. Picasso was nowhere to be seen, but others were, such as Archipenko, Braque, Csaky, Gleizes, Gris, Hayden, Herbin, Léger, Lhote, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Severini and Survage.\n\nThe most outrageous Dada eruption to date transpired at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. The Dadaist saw the Indépendants as decisive in the push to the top of the avant-garde food chain of the Parisian art scene. The plan was as cunning as it was devious: Tristan Tzara and André Breton rented an auditorium at the Grand Palais. A group guided by Tzara distributed flyers and posters saying that Charlie Chaplin would appear \"in the flesh\" on February 5. The crowd heckled when Chaplin (not even aware of the event) never showed up, and Tzara was ready: his group hurled insults back at the crowd from the stage.\n\nThe renown literary figure André Gide present in the audience, fooled as the others, described the happening: \"Some young people, solemn, stilted, tied up in knots, got up on the platform and as a chorus declaimed insincere inanities\".\n\nThe offensive event witnessed by the more respectable Cubists solicited a vehement denunciation, declaring Dada an abomination.\n\nThe Salon des Indépendants of 1921, which opened in January, had less Cubist paintings than the previous year. Braque and Metzinger were not represented. The artists that did exhibit included Gleizes, Ferat, Hayden, Marcoussis, Hellesen and Survage. With the Cubists were also Hélène Pordriat, Marthe Laurens, Irène Lagut, Alice Halicka and Sonia Lewitska. At the exhibition were also the works of Bissière, Blanchard, Dufy, Lhote, Tirman, Zadkine and Lipchitz.\n\nThe hanging commission was conducted in opposition to Signac, who was in favor of the alphabetical order system. Léger left the placement committee in 1923. In 1924 placement was classified by nationality and alphabetically. Lhote left the placement committee, which consisted of 20 people, along with eight other members in 1925. Lhote was of the opinion that the change was mainly intended for the \"Sunday painters\". Signac and his supporters defended the alphabetical order stressing 'equal attention to all participants' and that there was no place for 'les petites chapelles' (the little chapels). The latter was especially directed against the neo-cubists, who after the First World wished to be associated with well-known artists.\n\nFrom 1920 the \"Société des Artistes Indépendants\" obtained the Grand Palais for its salon exhibitions. After World War II, the \"Salon des Indépendants\" was renewed with the artist group \"\", with the assistance of Dunoyer de Segonzac, Bernard Buffet, Jean Carzou, Maurice Boitel, Yves Brayer, Aristide Caillaud, Daniel du Janerand, amongst others.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Every wavelength of visible light is perceived as a spectral color, in a continuous spectrum; the colors of sufficiently close wavelengths are indistinguishable.\n\nThe spectrum is often divided into named colors, though any division is somewhat arbitrary; the spectrum is continuous. Traditional colors in English include: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. In some other languages the ranges corresponding to color names do not necessarily agree with those in English.\n\nThe division used by Isaac Newton, in his color wheel, was: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet; a mnemonic for this order is \"Roy G. Biv\". Less commonly, \"VIBGYOR\" is also used for the reverse order. In modern divisions of the spectrum, indigo is often omitted.\n\nOne needs at least trichromatic color vision for there to be a distinction between spectral and non-spectral colours: trichromacy gives a possibility to perceive both hue and saturation in the chroma. In color models capable of representing spectral colors, such as CIELUV, a spectral color has the maximal saturation.\n\nIn color spaces which include all, or most spectral colors, they form a part of boundary of the set of all real colors. If luminance is counted, then spectral colors form a surface, otherwise their locus is a curve in a two-dimensional chromaticity space.\n\nTheoretically, only RGB-implemented colors which might be really spectral are its primaries: red, green, and blue, whereas any other (mixed) color is inherently non-spectral. But due to different chromaticity properties of different spectral segments, and also due to practical limitations of light sources, the actual distance between RGB pure color wheel colors and spectral colors shows a complicated dependence on the hue. Due to location of R and G primaries near the almost \"flat\" spectral segment, RGB color space is reasonably good with approximating spectral orange, yellow, and bright (yellowish) green, but is especially poor in reaching a visual appearance of spectral colors between green and blue, as well as extreme spectral colors. The sRGB standard has an additional problem with its \"red\" primary which is shifted to orange due to a trade-off between purity of red and its reasonable luminance, so that the red spectral became unreachable. Some samples in the table below provide only rough approximations of spectral and near-spectral colors.\n\nCMYK is usually even poorer than RGB in its reach of spectral colors, with notable exception of process yellow, which is rather close to spectral colors due to aforementioned flatness of the spectral locus in the red–green segment.\n\nNote that spectral color are universally included to scientific color models such as CIE 1931, but industrial and consumer color spaces such as sRGB, CMYK, and Pantone, do not include any of spectral colors.\n\nMost of the colors listed do not reach the maximal (spectral) colorfulness, or are not usually seen with it, but they can be saturated enough to be perceived closely to their dominant wavelength spectral colors. Ranges of wavelengths and frequencies are only approximate.\n\nWavelengths and frequencies in gray indicate dominant wavelengths and frequencies, not actual range of spectrum composing a specified color, which extends farther to both sides and is averaged by receptors to give a near-spectral appearance.\n\nAmong some of the colors that are spectral colors are:\n\n\n"}

It has been held annually since 2002 and is organized by the student-driven, non-profit entrepreneurship association at the Royal Institute of Technology, Excitera. The competition's audience is students at Swedish universities and high schools, particularly those studying game development and software engineering. Funding is handled through partnerships with various software and game development companies, e.g. Digital Illusions CE and Sun Microsystems.\n\nSwedish Game Awards started in 2002 as a PC-only game competition under the name KTH Game Awards, and was targeted mainly at students in the Stockholm area. In 2004, KTH Game Awards was merged with another competition organized by Excitera, called the Excitera Mobile Award. This led to the creation of special class for mobile phone games. After its first iteration, the name was changed to Swedish Game Awards to reflect the increase in scope from local to national competition, as well as the fact that the competition had grown to be the largest of its kind in Sweden.\n\nIn 2014 the competitions hosts changed from students of Royal Institute of Technology to students of Södertörn University (while still maintaining its cooperation with Excitera).\n\nIn 2015 the competition added the category Best Diversity Effort as a result of their cooperataion with Diversi to reflect the games industry's increasing interest in variation of its developers and consumers. The final day of the competition also had its first livestream on YouTube by cooperating with students of Medieinstitutet to make the announcement of the winners available directly to the public. It also broke the previous record of submitted games in 2014 (which was 98) with 104 games.\n\nThe competition has gradually gained recognition from Swedish game development companies and universities as a way for students to show their game development capabilities and thus increase their chances of getting employment within the video game industry.\n\nThe 2014-2015 competition is organized by a team of Stockholm-based university students in various fields related to game design. \nIn its 13th year, the Swedish Game Awards continues annually to draw greater numbers of entries from student-development teams across Sweden.\n\nThe parameters to the competition have remained relatively stable over the years, aimed toward providing a launching pad for talented, independent, student game developers to develop new and marketable games. \nThe official rules are available at http://gameawards.se/competition/rules.\n\nThe process of the Swedish Game Awards spans the majority of each academic year. Beginning in October with the SGA Kickoff, previous winners, current jury members, and corporate sponsors are invited to present their perspectives of the game industry and the Swedish Game Awards in particular to the upcoming year's participants. Also at this time, the various award categories are announced.

Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in the application of Quantum Mechanics in physics and chemistry, for example it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's properties, such as its dipole moment and its allowed spectroscopic transitions (based on selection rules), without doing the exact rigorous calculations (which, in some cases, may not even be possible). Group theory is the predominant framework for analyzing molecular symmetry.\n\nAmong all the molecular symmetries, diatomic molecules show some distinct features and they are relatively easier to analyze.\n\nThe physical laws governing a system is generally written as a relation (equations, differential equations, integral equations etc.). An operation on the ingredients of this relation, which keeps the form of the relations invariant is called a symmetry transformation or a symmetry of the system.\nSymmetry is a fundamentally important concept in quantum mechanics. It can predict conserved quantities and provide quantum numbers. It can predict degeneracies of eigenstates and gives insights about the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian without calculating them. Rather than looking into individual symmetries, it is sometimes more convenient to look into the general relations between the symmetries. It turns out that Group theory is the most efficient way of doing this.\n\nA \"group\" is a mathematical structure (usually denoted in the form (\"G\",*)) consisting of a set \"G\" and a binary operation formula_1 (sometimes loosely called 'multiplication'), satisfying the following properties:\n\nThe set of all symmetry transformations of a Hamiltonian has the structure of a group, with group multiplication equivalent to applying the transformations one after the other. The group elements can be represented as matrices, so that the group operation becomes the ordinary matrix multiplication. In quantum mechanics, the evolution of an arbitrary superposition of states are given by unitary operators, so each of the elements of the symmetry groups are unitary operators. Now any unitary operator can be expressed as the exponential of some Hermitian operator . So, the corresponding Hermitian operators are the 'generators' of the symmetry group. These unitary transformations act on the Hamiltonian operator in some Hilbert space in a way that the Hamiltonian remains invariant under the transformations. In other words, the symmetry operators commute with the Hamiltonian. If formula_11 represents the unitary symmetry operator and acts on the Hamiltonian formula_12, then;\n\nThese operators have the above-mentioned properties of a group: \nSo, by the symmetry of a system, we mean a set of operators, each of which commutes with the Hamiltonian, and they form a symmetry group. This group may be Abelian or Non-Abelian. Depending upon which one it is, the properties of the system changes (for example, if the group is Abelian, there would be no degeneracy). Corresponding to every different kind of symmetry in a system, we can find a symmetry group associated with it.\n\nIt follows that the generator formula_13 of the symmetry group also commutes with the Hamiltonian. Now, it follows that:\n\nSome specific examples can be systems having rotational, translational invariance etc.. For a rotationally invariant system, The symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is the general rotation group. Now, if (say) the system is invariant about any rotation about Z-axis (i.e., the system has axial symmetry), then the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is the group of rotation about the symmetry axis. Now, this group is generated by the Z-component of the orbital angular momentum, formula_14 (general group element formula_15). Thus, formula_14 commutes with formula_12 for this system and Z-component of the angular momentum is conserved. Similarly, translation symmetry gives rise to conservation of linear momentum, inversion symmetry gives rise to parity conservation and so on.\n\nA molecule at equilibrium in a certain electronic state usually has some geometrical symmetry.This symmetry is described by a certain point group which consists of operations (called symmetry operations) that produce a spatial orientation of the molecule that is indistinguishable from the starting configuration. There are five types of point group symmetry operation: identity, rotation, reflection, inversion and improper rotation or rotation-reflection. Common to all symmetry operations is that the geometrical center-point of the molecule does not change its position; hence the name point group. One can determine the elements of the point group for a particular molecule by considering the geometrical symmetry of its molecular model. However, when one uses a point group, the elements are not to be interpreted in the same way. Instead the elements rotate and/or reflect the vibronic (vibration-electronic) coordinates and these elements commute with the vibronic Hamiltonian. The point group is used to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates. The symmetry classification of the rotational levels, the eigenstates of the full (rovibronic nuclear spin) Hamiltonian, requires the use of the appropriate permutation-inversion group as introduced by Longuet-Higgins. See the Section \"Inversion symmetry and nuclear permutation symmetry\" below, and Link \n. The elements of permutation-inversion groups commute with the full molecular Hamiltonian. In addition to point groups, there exists another kind of group important in crystallography, where translation in 3-D also needs to be taken care of. They are known as space groups.\n\nThe five basic symmetry operations mentioned above are:\nIt is to be noted that all other symmetry present in a specific molecule are a combination of these 5 operations.\n\nThe Schoenflies (or Schönflies) notation, named after the German mathematician Arthur Moritz Schoenflies, is one of two conventions commonly used to describe point groups. This notation is used in spectroscopy and is used here to specify a molecular point group.\n\nThere are two point groups for diatomic molecules: formula_22 for heteronuclear diatomics, and formula_22 for homonuclear diatomics.\nThe group formula_22, contains rotations formula_26 through any angle formula_27 about the axis of symmetry and an infinite number of reflections formula_18 through the planes containing the inter-nuclear axis (or the vertical axis, that is reason of the subscript '\"v\"').In the group formula_22 all planes of symmetry are equivalent, so that all reflections formula_18 form a single class with a continuous series of elements; the axis of symmetry is bilateral, so that there is a continuous series of classes, each containing two elements formula_31. Note that this group is Non-abelian and there exists an infinite number of irreducible representations in the group. The character table of the group is as follows:\n\nIn addition to axial reflection symmetry, homonuclear diatomic molecules are symmetric with respect to inversion or reflection through any axis in the plane passing through the point of symmetry and perpendicular to the inter-nuclear axis. The classes of the group formula_18 can be obtained from those of the group formula_22 using the relation between the two groups: formula_35. Like formula_22, formula_18 is non-Abelian and there are an infinite number of irreducible representations in the group.The character table of this group is as follows:\n\nUnlike a single atom, the Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule doesn't commute with formula_38. So the quantum number formula_39 is no longer a good quantum number. The internuclear axis chooses a specific direction in space and the potential is no longer spherically symmetric. Instead, formula_38 and formula_38 commutes with the Hamiltonian formula_12 (taking the arbitrary internuclear axis as the \"Z\" axis). But formula_43 do not commute with formula_12 due to the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule is invariant under rotations about the internuclear line (the \"Z\" axis), but not under rotations about the \"X\" or \"Y\" axes. Again, formula_38 and formula_38 act on a different Hilbert space, so they commute with formula_12 in this case also. The electronic Hamiltonian for a diatomic molecule is also invariant under reflections in all planes containing the internuclear line. The (\"X-Z\") plane is such a plane, and reflection of the coordinates of the electrons in this plane corresponds to the operation formula_48. If formula_38 is the operator that performs this reflection, then formula_50. So the Complete Set of Commuting Operators (CSCO) for a general heteronuclear diatomic molecule is formula_51; where formula_52 is an operator that inverts only one of the two spatial co-ordinates (\"x or y). \"\n\nIn the special case of a homonuclear diatomic molecule, there is an extra symmetry since in addition to the axis of symmetry provided by the internuclear axis, there is a centre of symmetry at the midpoint of the distance between the two nuclei (the symmetry discussed in this paragraph only depends on the two nuclear charges being the same. The two nuclei can therefore have different mass, that is they can be two isotopes of the same species such as the proton and the deuteron, or formula_38 and formula_38, and so on). Choosing this point as the origin of the coordinates, the Hamiltonian is invariant under an inversion of the coordinates of all electrons with respect to that origin, namely in the operation formula_55. Thus the parity operator formula_56. Thus the CSCO for a homonuclear diatomic molecule is formula_57.\n\nMolecular term symbol is a shorthand expression of the group representation and angular momenta that characterize the state of a molecule. It is the equivalent of the term symbol for the atomic case. We already know the CSCO of the most general diatomic molecule. So, the good quantum numbers can sufficiently describe the state of the diatomic molecule. Here, the symmetry is explicitly stated in the nomenclature.\n\nHere, the system is not spherically symmetric. So, formula_58, and the state cannot be depicted in terms of formula_39 as an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian is not an eigenstate of formula_18 anymore (in contrast to the atomic term symbol, where the states were written as formula_61). But, as formula_62, the eigenvalues corresponding to formula_38 can still be used. If,\n\nformula_64\n\nwhere formula_65 is the absolute value (in a.u.) of the projection of the total electronic angular momentum on the internuclear axis; formula_66 can be used as a term symbol. By analogy with the spectroscopic notation S, P, D, F, ... used for atoms, it is customary to associate code letters with the values of formula_66 according to the correspondence:\nFor the individual electrons, the notation and the correspondence used are:\n\nformula_68 and\n\nAgain, formula_50, and in addition: formula_70 [as formula_71]. It follows immediately that if formula_72 the action of the operator formula_38 on an eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue formula_74 of formula_14 converts this state into another one corresponding to the eigenvalue formula_76, and that both eigenstates have the same energy. The electronic terms such that formula_72 (that is, the terms formula_78) are thus doubly degenerate, each value of the energy corresponding to two states which differ by the direction of the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the molecular axis. This twofold degeneracy is actually only approximate and it is possible to show that the interaction between the electronic and rotational motions leads to a splitting of the terms with formula_72 into two nearby levels, which is called formula_66-doubling.\n\nformula_81 corresponds to the formula_82 states. These states are non-degenerate, so that the states of a formula_82 term can only be multiplied by a constant in a reflection through a plane containing the molecular axis. When formula_81, simultaneous eigenfunctions of formula_12,formula_14 and formula_14 can be constructed. Since formula_88, the eigenfunctions of formula_14 have eigenvalues formula_90. So to completely specify formula_82 states of diatomic molecules, formula_38 states, which is left unchanged upon reflection in a plane containing the nuclei, needs to be distinguished from formula_38 states, for which it changes sign in performing that operation.\n\nHomonuclear diatomic molecules have a center of symmetry at their midpoint. Choosing this point as the origin of the coordinates, the electronic Hamiltonian is invariant under the point group operation i of inversion of the coordinates of all electrons at that origin. This operation is not the parity operation P (or E*); the parity operation involves the inversion of nuclear and electronic spatial coordinates at the molecular center of mass. Electronic states are either even, i.e. remain unchanged by the operation i, or they are odd, i.e. changed in sign by i. The former are denoted by the subscript g and are called gerade, while the latter are denoted by the subscript u and are called ungerade. The subscripts g or u are therefore added to the term symbol, so that for homonuclear diatomic molecules we have formula_94 electronic states. A homonuclear diatomic molecule has four non-degenerate formula_82 electronic states: formula_96. Vibronic states are classified according to the irreducible representations of the appropriate point group.\n\nThe complete Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule (as for all molecules) commutes with the parity operation P or E* and rovibronic energy levels (usually called rotational levels) can be given the parity symmetry label + or -. The complete Hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule also commutes with the operation\nof permuting (or exchanging) the coordinates of the two (identical) nuclei and rotational levels \ngain the additional label s or a depending on whether the total wavefunction is\nunchanged (symmetric) or changed in sign (antisymmetric) by the permutation operation. Thus, the rotational levels of heteronuclear diatomic molecules are labelled + or -, whereas those of homonuclear diatomic\nmolecules are labelled +s, +a, -s or -a. The rovibronic nuclear spin states are classified using the appropriate permutation-inversion group.\n\nThe complete Hamiltonian of a homonuclear diatomic molecule (as for all centro-symmetric molecules)\ndoes not commute with the point group inversion operation i because of the effect of the nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian. The nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of g and u vibronic states (called ortho-para mixing) and give\nrise to ortho-para transitions\n\nIf S denotes the resultant of the individual electron spins, formula_97 are the eigenvalues of S and as in the case of atoms, each electronic term of the molecule is also characterised by the value of S. If spin-orbit coupling is neglected, there is a degeneracy of order formula_98 associated with each formula_99 for a given formula_66. Just as for atoms, the quantity formula_98 is called the multiplicity of the term and.is written as a (left) superscript, so that the term symbol is written as formula_102. For example, the symbol formula_103denotes a term such that formula_104 and formula_105. It is worth noting that the ground state (often labelled by the symbol formula_106) of most diatomic molecules is such that formula_107 and exhibits maximum symmetry. Thus, in most cases it is a formula_108 state (written as formula_109, excited states are written with formula_110 in front) for a heteronuclear molecule and a formula_111 state (written as formula_112) for a homonuclear molecule.\n\nSpin–orbit coupling lifts the degeneracy of the electronic states. This is because the \"z\"-component of spin interacts with the \"z\"-component of the orbital angular momentum, generating a total electronic angular momentum along the molecule axis J. This is characterized by the quantum number formula_18, where formula_114. Again, positive and negative values of formula_18 are degenerate, so the pairs (\"M\", \"M\") and (−\"M\", −\"M\") are degenerate. These pairs are grouped together with the quantum number formula_116, which is defined as the sum of the pair of values (\"M\", \"M\") for which \"M\" is positive: formula_117\n\nSo, the overall molecular term symbol for the most general diatomic molecule is given by:\n\nformula_118\n\nwhere\n\nThe electronic terms or potential curves formula_121 of a diatomic molecule depend only on the internuclear distance formula_122, and it is important to investigate the behaviour of these potential curves as R varies.It is of considerable interest to examine the intersection of the curves representing the different terms.\n\nLet formula_123 and formula_123 two different electronic potential curves. If they intersect at some point, then the functions formula_123 and formula_123 will have neighbouring values near this point. To decide whether such an intersection can occur, it is convenient to put the problem as follows. Suppose at some internuclear distance formula_127 the values formula_128 and formula_128 are close, but distinct (as shown in the figure). Then it is to be examined whether or formula_123 and formula_123 can be made to intersect by the modification formula_132. The energies formula_133 and formula_134 are eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian formula_135. The corresponding orthonormal electronic eigenstates will be denoted by formula_136 and formula_137 and are assumed to be real.\nThe Hamiltonian now becomes formula_138, where formula_139 is the small perturbation operator (though it is a degenerate case, so ordinary method of perturbation won't work). setting formula_140, it can be deduced that in order for formula_123 and formula_123 to be equal at the point formula_143 the following two conditions are required to be fulfilled:\n\nHowever, we have at our disposal only one arbitrary parameter formula_144 giving the perturbation formula_145. Hence the\n\ntwo conditions involving more than one parameter cannot in general be simultaneously satisfied (the initial assumption that formula_136 and formula_137 real, implies that formula_148 is also real). So, two case can arise: \nThus, in a diatomic molecule, only terms of different symmetry can intersect, while the intersection of terms of like symmetry is forbidden. This is, in general, true for any case in quantum mechanics where the Hamiltonian contains some parameter and its eigenvalues are consequently functions of that parameter. This general rule is known as von Neumann - Wigner non-crossing rule. \nThis general symmetry principle has important consequences is molecular spectra.\nIn fact, in the applications of valence bond method in case of diatomic molecules, three main correspondence between the atomic and the molecular orbitals are taken care of:\nThus, von Neumann-Wigner non-crossing rule also acts as a starting point for valence bond theory.\n\nSymmetry in diatomic molecules manifests itself directly by influencing the molecular spectra of the molecule. The effect of symmetry on different types of spectra in diatomic molecules are:\n\nIn the electric dipole approximation the transition amplitude for emission or absorption of radiation can be shown to be proportional to the vibronic matrix element of the component of the electric dipole operator formula_174 along the molecular axis. This is the permanent electric dipole moment.\nIn homonuclear diatomic molecules, the permanent electric dipole moment vanishes and there is no pure rotation spectrum.\nHeteronuclear diatomic molecules possess a permanent electric dipole moment and exhibit spectra corresponding to rotational transitions, without change in the vibronic state. For formula_175, the selection rules for a rotational transition are: formula_176. For formula_177, the selection rules become: formula_178.This is due to the fact that although the photon absorbed or emitted carries one unit of angular momentum, the nuclear rotation can change, with no change in formula_179, if the electronic angular momentum makes an equal and opposite change. Symmetry considerations require that the electric dipole moment of a diatomic molecule is directed along the internuclear line, and this leads to the additional selection rule formula_180.The pure rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule consists of lines in the far infra-red or the microwave region, the frequencies of these lines given by:\n\nformula_181; where formula_182, and formula_183\n\nThe transition matrix elements for pure vibrational transition are formula_184, where formula_185 is the dipole moment of the diatomic molecule in the electronic state formula_186. Because the dipole moment depends on the bond length formula_187, its variation with displacement of the nuclei from equilibrium can be expressed as: formula_188\n\nThe analysis of formula_189 using variational method starts assuming these forms. Again, this is only one possible combination of states. There can be other combination of states also, for example, the electron is in an excited state of the hydrogen atom. The corresponding Hamiltonian of the system is:\n\nformula_190\n\nClearly, using the states formula_191 and formula_192 as basis will introduce off-diagonal elements in the Hamiltonian. Here, because of the relative simplicity of the formula_189 ion, the matrix elements can actually be calculated. The electronic Hamiltonian of formula_189 commutes with the point group inversion symmetry operation i. Using its symmetry properties, we can relate the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian as:\n\nWhere, formula_197is the ground-state energy of the hydrogen atom.\n\nAgain,formula_198\n\nformula_199\n\nwhere the last step follows from the fact that formula_200 and from the symmetry of the system, the value of the integrals are same.\n\nNow the off-diagonal terms:\n\nformula_201\n\nformula_202\n\nby inserting a complete set of states formula_203 in the last term. formula_204 is called the 'overlap integral'\n\nAnd,\n\nformula_205\n\nformula_206 (as the wave functions are real)\n\nSo, formula_207\nBecause formula_208 as well as formula_208, the linear combination of formula_191 andformula_192 that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian is formula_212 (after normalization). Now as formula_213iformula_214 for formula_189, the states formula_216 are also eigenstates of i. It turns out that formula_217 and formula_218 are the eigenstates of i with eigenvalues +1 and -1 (in other words, the wave functions formula_219 and formula_220 are gerade (symmetric) and ungerade (unsymmetric), respectively). The corresponding expectation value of the energies are formula_221. \n\nFrom the graph, we see that only formula_38 has a minimum corresponding to a separation of 1.3 Å and a total energy formula_223, which is less than the initial energy of the system, formula_224. Thus, only the gerade state stabilizes the ion with a binding energy of formula_225. As a result, the ground state of formula_189 is formula_227 and this state formula_228 is called a bonding molecular orbital.\n\nThus, symmetry plays an explicit role in the formation of formula_189.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13271762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13271762", "title": "Territory band", "text": "Territory band\n\nTerritory bands were dance bands that crisscrossed specific regions of the United States from the 1920s through the 1960s. Beginning in the 1920s, the bands typically had 8 to 12 musicians. These bands typically played one-nighters, 6 or 7 nights a week at venues like VFW halls, Elks Lodges, Lions Clubs, hotel ballrooms, and the like. Francis Davis, jazz critic for The Village Voice, likened territory bands to \"the Top 40 cover bands (of the 1970s and 1980s) of their day, typically relying on stock arrangements of other ensembles' hits.\" He said, \"many historians give much credit to territory bands for popularizing modern ballroom dancing that began during the World War I era with the influence of Vernon and Irene Castle.\"\n\nTerritory bands helped disseminate popular music — which included swing, jazz, sweet dance music, or any combination thereof — bringing it to remote gin mills and dance halls that were otherwise ignored by national booking agents representing genuine recording stars like Ellington and Armstrong. Many developed original repertoires and signature sounds, none more storied than Walter Page's Blue Devils, the Oklahoma City-based outfit that Count Basie joined in 1926.\n\nThere were black bands and white bands, and bands of various immigrant ethnicities. There were also all-female bands, such as the International Sweethearts of Rhythm.\n\nMusician, composer, and scholar Gunther Schuller asserted in one of his books, \"The Swing Era: The Development of Jazz, 1930–1945 (The History of Jazz, Vol. 2)\" that, \"territory bands, by definition, were black. There were, of course, many white bands in the 'territories' but they tended to have the more lucrative and permanent jobs and therefore not required to travel as much as the black bands.\" Another musician (former territory band musician and historian), Jack Behrens, expressed in a book that Schuller's depiction of divergent work conditions was narrow. \"During my playing days in the 1940s and 50s in several white territory bands, we didn't have \"lucrative and permanent jobs\" unless you count day labor in a dairy bar or clerking at a military surplus store. Worse, there were times we didn't get paid at all and we had little recourse given the cost of legal advice.\"\n\nFor most territory bands — whether black, white, integrated, male, female — the musicians were nearly always paid. Neither the booking agencies nor the musicians got rich, but regular salaries helped maintain pretty decent musicianship.\n\nMost musicians witnessed and experienced a wide variety of Jim Crow practices, from city to city and region to region. One common present-day misconception is that Jim Crow practices were more prevalent in the South. The practices were prevalent everywhere, especially in New York City and the Midwest. The bands that were racially integrated commonly experienced problems, mostly from having to dodge different applications and degrees of Jim Crow among cities and regions. Many bands, especially The International Sweethearts of Rhythm, handled some of the absurdities with a degree of inward, sarcastic humor. When musicians grew wary or even felt vulnerable to injustices of Jim Crow, the band bus, for those who had one, served as a safe haven.\n\nThe published history of territory bands is thin. Most of what we know comes from fading memories and second-hand anecdotes. With a lack of discography and the passing of a generation, our knowledge is slipping. While many territory bands were of high quality, they rarely recorded and were often unfairly considered minor league to the national touring bands. Moreover, they were confined to specific regions or states … even parts of a state. Ambitious and hopeful young musicians saw territory bands as a training ground for, or rite of passage to, the major big bands. The alumni of territory band musicians who matriculated to fame within the industry reads like list of \"who's who\" in music.\n\nTerritory bands typically played more sweet music, though, some in the mid 1950s, particularly those with talented musicians, managed to entertain dancers with a jazzier sound. But dancing audiences are what kept the bands employed. In the 1920s, territory bands commonly traveled by car (station wagon), followed by an equipment truck for the PA system, guitar amplifiers and drum kit. Later, beginning in the mid-1930s, territory bands commonly traveled in sleeper trailers.\n\nHome territories were loosely defined, but some classifications emerged. Generally, the areas were defined as Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, West Coast, Southwest and Northwest. In addition, some state-groupings became common.\n\nMINK was a particularly distinguished state group. It was composed of Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas.\n\nVSA was composed of Virginia, South Carolina and Alabama.\n\nThe Southwest proved especially fertile for territory bands. Texas, with its spread-out geography and relatively large population, offered the greatest opportunity with developed markets for dance music in Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Amarillo, and other cities. The homegrown audiences of Texas bands were so plentiful that the bands developed to a high degree in relative isolation from outside influences. One such band was that of Alphonso Trent.\n\nBands out of Los Angeles and Seattle performed not only in California, Oregon, and Washington, but also Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana. The Glenn Henry Orchestra, which got its first big break playing summers at Yellowstone Park from 1935 to 1940, became a popular West Coast territory band.\n\nThere were military territories, too — NCO Clubs, Officers' Clubs. These clubs took bands to Greenland, Nova Scotia, Bermuda, Puerto Rico, as well as the US.\n\nThe musicians in the territory dance bands were primarily jazz musicians. Despite the overwhelming view that New Orleans was the cradle of jazz, the itinerant musicians were the ones who first disseminated it.\n\nThe dancing public could actually dance and they knew which bands swung and which simply just played well. Audiences responded with great enthusiasm to the black bands in the Midwest. The East Coast black bands were popular in the 1920s; but \"Swing\" came to that region in the form of Louis Armstrong joining the Fletcher Henderson band when he went to the Big Apple.\n\nTerritory bands were not all swing bands. The Midwest settlements of Europeans of various ethnicities brought their community dancing and revelry with them in the form of very popular polka bands (and also old time waltzes, leandlers, and schottisches). They played at all the ballrooms, Elk Clubs, and the like as well. Here's a short exemplary list:\n\nThere were traveling bands well before the 1920s & 30s. One of many examples were musicians who did their booking from Redfield, South Dakota. Redfield was a railroad hub in the Northern Plains. All their booking was up and down the rail line.\n\nIn 1924, according to Variety, there were more than 900 dance bands, representing steady work for 7,200 musicians. There were 68 Whiteman orchestras across the country, playing music from the Whiteman library, eleven in New York alone. In the mid-20s, bands typically had ten musicians: two altos, one tenor (who often doubled on other woodwinds and sometimes violin), two trumpets, trombone, banjo or guitar, piano, string bass or brass bass, and drums. Sometimes there were two trombones. If the band had only two saxophones, they would be alto and tenor.\n\nThe Great Depression, which hit bottom in 1933, was hard on territory bands. The public strained to afford entertainment. It was not uncommon for bands to be stranded for lack of funds. Many broke up during this period.\n\nThere are many theories on why swing music and territory bands declined. Here are a few:\n\nIn the history of traveling dance bands, all female bands are often excluded, or only given minor inclusion. Popular culture seemed to regard the musical performances dance bands provided as an area meant to be dominated by men. In the scenarios where women were allowed to join in, they were often denoted as separate. This is seen in the way many female singers were nicknamed “canaries,” denoting them not as musicians, but as pretty objects meant to be on display. One example that shows just how foreign women could be considered appears in the name of a band Mary Lou Williams headed that was called \"Six Men and a Girl.\" Oftentimes these stereotypes surrounding performing women extended to instrumentalists.\n\nAll female performers were not a new idea in the dawn of traveling jazz bands though. All women groups performing American genres of music dates back to minstrel groups like Madame Rentz’s Female Minstrels. Because women could not easily enter prestigious music bands that were essentially all male, all women groups continuously popped up as groups that allowed skilled female musicians to perform. Sometimes they were put together with help from outside sources. It was not uncommon for a group to be put together by a man or a talent agency, but to consist of all female performers. Sometimes performers received aide from family or friends involved in the business to help get their foot in the door. For instance, Lil Hardin Armstrong had an all woman dance band in the early 1930s. This group went by such names as \"Lil Armstrong and Her Swing Band.\" Other bands popular in the 1930s include The Harlem Playgirls, The Dixie Sweethearts, the Darlings of Rhythm, and Gertrude Long and Her Rambling Night Hawks.\n\nEven banding together with other women though, public perception would sometimes view all female bands as “all-girl gimmicks.” Some talented musicians avoided joining all female bands in the fear that their talent would be disregarded in such a context. Yet all female bands were also forced into the feminine appearances they were also demeaned for. In many ways, this made being in a traveling dance band more difficult for women than it had been for men. After a night spent traveling women were expected to be visions of beauty with perfect make up, hair, and personalities. Often the ultra feminine clothes they had to wear, such as strapless dress and high heels, also affected their ability to play and perform. As had been shown in previous attempts women had made to broach men’s groups, attempting to break away from this dainty female image could call the sexuality and morality of a performer into question. Yet women’s performances were also often debased to their visual looks and sexual attractiveness, even though many reviewers criticized them for these elements.\n\nA certain need to prove themselves seemed to exist among many of the female musicians who worked in dance bands. These performers inherited a lot of the stereotypes that surrounded their previous female performer counterparts: chorus line girls and girl singers. The sexual objectification of women that haunted those two careers was also a part of being in an all female band. Furthermore, chorus line girls had an association with loose morals and even prostitution, and loss of face for an instrumentalist could mean the end of a career. These kinds of associations also made many people assume that female instrumentalists were not talented players. Upon interviewing later in life, many women insisted that they were talented musicians who knew how to play. This insistence seems to be in direct reaction to the claims that circulated that female musicians were not meant to play well but simply to look pretty. While it’s true that many agencies required photos in their applications to join female bands, the musicians in them still tended to be quite talented.\n\nWhile many people view the end of the Swing era as the opening of World War II, this was not the case for all woman dance bands. Instead, they flourished during the 1940s. Swing music became a form of patriotism to a country at war. The all-girl bands that did the best at this time tended to be groups formed before American involvement in the war. Once it was realized that women could fill a major hole in the entertainment industry and that they could not be drafted, agencies and managers everywhere began trying to put together all female bands. In many ways, these musicians were very prepared to take over for the men because they had more advanced experience in playing instruments, either from hobbies or school bands. They were certainly more prepared for musical performance than many women were prepared for welding and factory work. Some groups connected to academic organizations, such as the International Sweethearts of Rhythm or the Prairie View Co-eds did very well at this time. These groups of industrious young women could come to represent an image of what the United States was at war for. Some of these groups even did USO tours. Soldiers shipped off to foreign lands, under the pressure war and deprived of any female presence were more than welcoming to these all woman groups. The armed audiences were known to have shown extreme appreciation for these female performers V-discs, recorded for broadcast on the Armed Forces Radio Network, often featured all-girl groups.\n\nOklahoma City\nHot Springs, Arkansas\nSaint Louis\nBirmingham, Alabama\nOhio\nMemphis\nDenver\nKansas City\nMiami\nOmaha\nMilwaukee\nTexas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArkansas\nCalifornia\nColorado\nIllinois\nIowa\nMinnesota \nMissouri\nNebraska\nNew York\nOklahoma\nOregon\nSouth Dakota\nTexas\nVirginia\n\n† Owned by Carl Fox until December 16, 1945, when he sold the Surf in Clear Lake, Iowa, The Prom in St. Paul, Minnesota, and The Terp in Austin, Minnesota, to William Karzas for $1.5 million.

The film premiere in Ukraine took place on March 7, 2018. \n\nThe film tells about a wandering artist Ruslan who saves princess Mila kidnapped by evil sorcerer Chornomor.\n\nIn Ukrainian version, the roles were dubbed by:\n\nTwo sorcerers, Finn and Shernomore, have an intense magical duel in favor of saving Finn's wife, Meena. Finn gains the upperhand at first, but is defeated by Shernomore who deceives him by stepping on a \"force field\", and losing all of his powers and youthfullness, which then transfers to Shernomore and transforms Meena into a stone statue in exchange for her power of love as a source of his magic.\n\nIn the present day, Ruslan, a wandering artist dreaming to become a knight, is having a small play which he plays the role of Finn and Shernomore, and is written by an eccentric and an aspiring playwright, Lester. In the castle lived a adventurous and kind princess named Meelah. She considers the castle as a hindrance for his father and the King, is forcing her to get married despite she doesn't love whoever he suggests. One night, she sneaks out and she was almost harrased by two men, until Ruslan arrives. He saves Meelah from the two and escape. When the two are alone, Ruslan, afraid of being judged by his status, disguises himself as a knight.\n\nThe next day, they share romantic moments as they develop their feelings for each other. Unfortunately, much to Ruslan's surprise and horror, Meelah was kidnapped via a tornado by Shernomore, He tries to pursue Meelah, but fails to do so and knocks himself unconscious. When he gained consciousness, he is confronted by the King, who mistakenly accuses him of harming the princess. He tries to tell the truth, but none of them belived him. Realizing Shernomore is real, he consults Lester and they set off to the cave where a wise cat lives. \n\nThe two asks for help on where to find Meelah and reveals to them a magic vortex where they discover a magical place and gives them a pea pod as a \"gift\". When they reached the cliff, a hamster suddenly steals the pod and they pursue it. But they realized that they are supposed to give it to him and unlocks a dinosaur-like bridge.\n\nMeanwhile, at Shernomore's castle, Meelah awakens at a bed and she tries to escape using a hat that makes the user invisible. Despite Shernomore casting a spell that makes all of the desserts there alive, she manages to defeat these and discovers the other ladies who are victims of Shernomore's evil sorcery.\n\nWhen the two arrive at the cave, they meet a strange old man who holds a staff similar to a wizard, and asks help on where to find Finn. However, the old man reveals himself to be Finn. But due to him having no contact on the outside world for too long, he is too paranoid to communicate with. With the help of Ruslan's plan, they pretend to be \"wizards\" who are casting a \"spell\" to lure him down. Finn, beliving that his powers are restored, tries to stop them. Ruslan and the gang pretend to be dead, only for them to contain Finn. When they got him, Ruslan asks where to find Shernomore and how to stop him, Finn tells them that his castle is made of spiky rocks and the source of his power is in his beard, asking him to cut it off, but no one was able to do that. And he tells Ruslan that he needs a magic sword in order to do that. After asking for the directions on where to find the sword, they locate and it is guarded by a giant knight. The giant challenges Ruslan in exchange for the armor and sword, but Ruslan manages to defeat all of them and they went to Shernomore's castle. \n\nWhen they got to the castle, they splitted to find Meelah. Ruslan finds Meelah in a different outfit and appearance and tells him that she does not need to rescue her, for she is happy at this place. This breaks Ruslan's heart. Feeling down, he slowly leaves the place. Suddenly, a giant monster attacks them. Lester tries to convince Ruslan to fight, but he's too lonely to do so. The bird gets Meelah's pendant and makes Ruslan realize that he is being deceived by Shernomore and gains courage to fight the monster. \n\nAfter defeating the monster, they went to the place where Meelah is kept and he and Shernomore engages at a n intense duel. Ruslan is defeated at first, but manages to incapacitate Shernomore by cutting his beard, losing his powers and transforms the stone staues and Finn back to normal. Ruslan tries to escape with Meelah, but they are trapped in the force field the same way as Finn did before. Ruslan sacrifices himself by pushing Meelah out of the trap, leaving him incapacitated. Meelah tries to pull Ruslan out, but is interrupted by the three nights, resulting in Ruslan's soul being zapped from him and leaving him lifeless. Enraged, Meelah fights the three knights and defeats them all (including Shernomore who is tied up). \n\nMeelah mourns for the apparent death of Ruslan and says that she loves him so much. A now-rejuvenated Finn appears and brings back Ruslan to life. The two reunite including Lester and Finn and Meena reunites as well. Ruslan confesses that he is not a real knight, but Meelah accepts this, and tells she still loves him no matter what. Finn conjures up a fireworks display, and they lived happily ever after.\n\nDuring the credits, Ruslan and Meelah shows being married and living a happy life.\n\nThe film is co-financed by Ukrainian State Film Agency: its share is 19.5 million UAH (total production cost of the film is 95.2 million UAH).\n\nOn January 30, 2013 producer Egor Olesov informed about the development of Ruslan and Lyudmila project based on a fairy tale poem with the same title by Aleksandr Pushkin. In September 2013, press service of FILM.UA Group announced the start of film production, and later the protagonists and synopsis for Ruslan and Lyudmila were presented with the film itself announced as 2D animation; later, however, the concept changed, and a decision was made to create a 3D animated film. \n\nHollywood consultants helped with developing the characters. According to the authors of the film, Ruslan and Lyudmila was made in English and then dubbed in Ukrainian. As Olesov says, Hollywood celebrities will be involved in English dubbing, and in Ukraine, popular local actors will lend their voices to the film. For the international market, the film was given another title, \"The Stolen Princess\".\n\nIn December 2015, the script and characters’ stories were finalized; animation of approved scenes was completed.\n\n\"The Stolen Princess\" became the first project in the line of theatrically animated premieres from Animagrad, which also includes Mavka. The Forest Song (2018), Snow Republic (2019), and Roksolana and Suleiman (2021). According to the company director, Animagrad plans to release one animated feature per year, both for local Ukrainian and international distribution.\n\nIn February 2015 at the European film market during Berlin International Film Festival, the rights to film distribution were sold to Israel and South Korea; in May 2016 at Marché du Film of Cannes International Film Festival, to France, French-speaking territories, Bulgaria, Iran, and Poland. On December 10, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter informed that the film after its presentation a month before at the American film market was sold to China, (Germany), Austria, Switzerland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, North Africa, and the Middle East. It was also announced that sales to some other territories were pending.\n\nOn March 13–16, 2017 in Hong Kong, FILMART took place, which is an annual film and TV content market. The FILM.UA Group stand presented projects of Animagrad studio, including \"The Stolen Princess\". On the penultimate day of the market, the scenes from the animated film were screened in Asia for the first time; the invitation to the premiere appeared on the cover of The Hollywood Reporter, and the screening itself was successful and gathered positive feedback from market participants. In early April, Cannes hosted MIPTV (Marché International des Programmes de Télévision), a major European market of audiovisual content. The stand of Ukrainian delegation presented, among others, \"The Stolen Princess\" film. On May 19 and 23, 2017 the biggest film market Marche du Film under the aegis of the 70th Cannes International Film Festival held market screenings of \"The Stolen Princess\", which enjoyed considerable success: the project gathered countless positive reviews, and negotiations on rights sales for the new territories began.\n\nImmediately after Ukrainian release, the theatrical release took place in Romania (March 16) and Turkey (March 23). During the first Romanian weekend, Ukrainian animated feature film collected $165,066 in the box office and placed second after American blockbuster Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer). It is interesting to compare the film with the main animated releases of 2017–2018 from Hollywood majors such as Disney Pixar, DreamWorks Animation, and Blue Sky Studios, which also took place in Romania: the box office of Ukrainian Princess during the first weekend exceeded those of Coco, Ferdinand the Bull, and Baby Boss, ceding only to the third movie of Cars franchise. The premiere box office of the Ukrainian film places it third among animated releases in Turkey in 2018.\n\nAs of April 13, \"The Stolen Princess\" is now shown in the cinemas of Ukraine, Romania, Turkey, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Lebanon, Jordan, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain. In total, the rights to the animated film screening have been sold to more than 50 countries, including France, Germany, countries of the Middle East, Southern Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In November 2018 Ukrainian media reported that the film had been shown in more than 40 countries with more than half a million viewers. In January 2019 the film will become the first Ukrainian film to be commercially released to cinemas in China.\n\nIn late December 2016 it was announced that the film will change its title from Ruslan and Lyudmila to \"The Stolen Princess\" for its Ukrainian release as well (before that, in February 2016 the film producers already informed that they will use \"The Stolen Princess\", not Ruslan and Lyudmila as the title for international distribution). In October 2017 it became known that film producers changed the title of the film for Ukrainian release again, to \"The Stolen Princess: Ruslan and Lyudmila\". The date of Ukrainian release, March 7, 2018, also became known. \nOn December 15, 2015, in the framework of winter film market of Odessa International Film Festival Novyi TV channel acquired the rights to TV broadcast of the film. According to the deal, the TV premiere of the film is scheduled in six months after the start of its theatrical release.\n\nThe theme song of the film Do zirok (To the Stars) was performed by Vremya i Steklo band. On February 14, a music video for the song was presented. The author of the Ukrainian lyrics is Oleksandra Ruban, the arrangement to the song was made by Milos Jelic, keyboard player in Okean Elzy band, and the instrumental part was performed by the musicians of Kyiv Virtuosos orchestra. \nThe final song in the end credits to the feature film, Ty Lyubov Moya (You’re My Love), was performed by Jamala.\n\nDuring the first weekend in Ukraine, the film collected 21 million UAH ($0.8 million) in its box office. During five weekends, the film collected 35,857,041 UAH and hit a record among films produced in Ukraine.\n\nThe film got mixed reviews. The audience noted the lack of Ukrainian flavor and blind copying of Hollywood standards, inappropriate references to current realia, and lack of charisma among certain characters. However, the reviewers have also praised high animation standards, clever jokes, and the animated feature film appealing to topics of interest to both adults and children.\n\n"}
