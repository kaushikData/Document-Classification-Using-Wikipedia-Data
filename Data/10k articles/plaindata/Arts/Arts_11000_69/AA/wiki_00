From the early 20th century, \"wildlife artist\" became a more usual term for contemporary animal painters.\n\nEspecially in the 17th century, animal painters would often collaborate with other artists, who would either paint the main subject in a historical or mythological piece, or the landscape background in a decorative one. Frans Snyders, a founder of the Baroque animal painting tradition, often provided the animals, and also still lifes of food, for Peter Paul Rubens; a different landscape specialist might provide the background.\n\nIn the Dutch Golden Age such specialists tended to produce smaller genre paintings concentrating on their specialism. Animal painters came lower down in the hierarchy of genres, but the best painters could make a very good living; many royal and aristocratic patrons were more interested in their subject matter than that of the more prestigious genres. Mainly in England, there were still more specialised painters from the 18th century who produced portraits of racehorses and prize specimens of livestock, whereas in France animal subjects continued to be decorative capriccios often set around garden statuary.\n\nIn 2014 \"The Guardian\" nominated \"The Goldfinch\" (1654) by Carel Fabritius (1622-1654) as the finest animal portrait.\n\nAnimalier, as a collective plural noun, is a term used in antiques for small-scale sculptures of animals in particular (animalier bronzes), but also paintings of animals. Large numbers of these were produced - often mass-produced - in the 19th century in France and elsewhere. Many earlier examples can be found, but animalier sculpture became more popular, and reputable, in early 19th century Paris, with the works of Antoine-Louis Barye (1795-1875) - for whom the term was coined, decisively, by critics in 1831 - and Christopher Fratin (1801-1864). By the mid 19th-century, a taste for animal subjects was widespread among the middle-classes.\n\nMany modern wildlife artists or art groups hold benefits to support wildlife conservation, or participate in contests held by wildlife conservation organisations.\n\n\nModern wildlife art painters include:\n\n\nForerunners of modern wildlife art sculpture include:\n\nModern wildlife art sculptors include:\n"}

Its projects include the Patent Lens, its successor The Lens, and the Biological Innovation for Open Society Initiative.\n\nCambia derives its name from the Spanish verb \"cambiar\", to change.\n\nCambia was established in 1992 by Richard Anthony Jefferson, a leading molecular biologist responsible for the invention of the GUS reporter system, with substantial early participation by Steven G Hughes, Kate J. Wilson, Andrzej Kilian, Chris A. Fields and Sujata Lakhani. Jefferson describes his vision to found a non-profit organisation in \"Innovations\", to provide more efficient and effective tools to solve the problems of agriculture and society.\n\nIn 1992, Cambia relocated to Canberra, Australia from The Netherlands, to oversee and troubleshoot the Rockefeller Foundation's rice biotechnology network in Asia. During this time, Jefferson, Wilson and the growing Cambia team visited hundreds of laboratories to help develop, improve, and apply biotechnology capabilities, particularly pertaining to rice. Cambia offered scientific courses and workshops, and increasing assistance in Intellectual Property management. Cambia's ethic was influenced by Jefferson's early years in enabling technology invention and distribution, but greatly refined through increasing awareness of socially and scientifically complex systems and using new thinking about biological evolution (including the Hologenome Theory of Evolution) as models for institution building and collaboration.\n\nCambia became one of the first social enterprises to use a hybrid licensing model to fund its public good activities. By selectively patenting important technologies, then creating tiered licensing models for their use, Cambia was able to ensure all parties fair access, but larger licensees would be required to pay more for their non-exclusive use, thus subsidising new developments and distribution and support to less wealthy users, including small enterprises and the public sector in the developing world. This model - developed also by the social entrepreneur David Green for universal access to eye care - is now becoming a pillar of social enterprise function.\n\nOver time Cambia's focus moved away from biotechnology and towards innovation systems and Intellectual Property. The Patent Lens and its successor The Lens are now the primary focus of Cambia. Cambia's goal has always been to enable and democratise innovation and their move towards free and open tools that help people understand intellectual property landscapes is a continuation of those values. In this way they have changed from a wet-science research institute into a strategic system-changing social enterprise.\n\nCambia's work to freely distribute scientific tools and techniques gave rise to the Biological Open Source (BiOS) Initiative in 2005. Through an open-source biotechnology license and Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) developed in 2005-2007, BiOS sought to establish freedom to operate for innovators by providing and exemplifying legal instruments by which innovators could collaboratively use intellectual property protection as a means to share and jointly improve technology for wider utility. BiOS was built on the back of Jefferson's invention of the GUS-based reporter system and the creation of TransBacter, a work-around for the creation of transgenic plants bypassing the highly patented Agrobacterium genus.\n\nAnother of Cambia's projects was the development in 2001 by then Chief Scientist Andrzej Kilian of Diversity Arrays Technology, a solid state sequence agnostic genotyping technology that was spun off into a company, DArT, Pty Ltd to perform agricultural genotyping services to the plant breeding community.\n\nA principal current project of Cambia is the free full-text online patent search and exploration facility and knowledge resource, The Lens (previously the Patent Lens). Launched in 2000 with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation as a US agricultural patent search facility, and substantially expanded in 2005-2007 to encompass patent documents from multiple jurisdictions and all domains, and information on the linkages between patent applications and the status of granted patents, the Patent Lens allowed free searching of almost 10 million full-text patent documents. It was distinguished as being the only not-for-profit facility of its kind, with international coverage and integrated links to non-patent literature. The Lens was launched in 2013 as the successor to the Patent Lens, making strides in the visual presentation of patent analysis and workspace management; it is the only global patent site with fully open, shareable, annotatable and re-usable data collections.\n\nIt also features an open biological patent facility, PatSeq, led by Professor Osmat Jefferson, with many advanced tools for searching and analysing biological sequences found in patents, to render gene patenting more transparent. The facility has mapped sequences disclosed in gene patents onto the genomes of humans, mice, maize, rice, soybean and others.\n\nCambia is social enterprise, and is a registered Non-Governmental Organisation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and a registered observer with the World Intellectual Property Organization. Within Australia, Cambia is registered with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) as a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee.\n\nCambia’s governance is overseen by a Board of Directors, according to its constitution.\n\nAs of July 2012, Cambia now operates principally from headquarters in Canberra, ACT at the NICTA (National ICT Australia) facility, with some staff based in Brisbane, Australia, at the Queensland University of Technology. Before its move to Brisbane in 2008, where it operated for four years, Cambia was located on the Black Mountain research campus of the CSIRO. Its glasshouse facilities were housed at the Australian National University campus.\n\n"}

It was released at the end of 1981; a year in which Wilde had already scored three highly successful hit singles and a best-selling debut album.\n\nThe single was another international success, topping the charts in Sweden and Switzerland and hitting the top ten in several other nations. It was released on the 7\" format but also as a 12\" single in Germany, although not in a remixed or extended version. The B-side of both releases was an exclusive non-album track called \"Watching for Shapes\".\n\n\"Cambodia\" was later included on Wilde's second album, \"Select\", which was released six months after the single in May 1982. The album version of \"Cambodia\" runs for 7:13 minutes, as it is teamed with a more uptempo instrumental version of the song, called \"Reprise\".\n\nMusically and lyrically, \"Cambodia\" showed a change in direction for Wilde from the new wave feel of her debut album. The song was mainly synth-driven, with oriental-sounding percussion.\n\nThe lyrics were inspired by the Operation Menu bombing campaign of Cambodia by the United States during the Vietnam War.\n\nIt has sold 1,080,000 copies in France.\n\n\"Cambodia\" was written by Marty Wilde and Ricki Wilde and has a length of seven minutes and thirteen seconds. \"The Independent\"s Chris Mugan found the song reminiscent of a \"film noir\". Stewart Mason of AllMusic noted that the song lacks the bubblegum pop influence present on Wilde's self-titled debut album, and is instead more synthesizer-driven. Matt James of \"PopMatters\" felt that the song was an attempt by Kim Wilde to prove that she could tackle serious issues, in the vein of The Human League's \"The Lebanon\" (1984) and Sting's \"Russians\" (1985).\n\nAccording to Yahoo!, songs like \"Cambodia\", \"View from a Bridge\" (1982) and Wilde's version of \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" (1986) brought her \"very close to [the] hearts\" of Australians. \"The Independent\"s Chris Mugan deemed the song one of Wilde's \"eighties classics\" alongside \"Kids in America\". In the \"Encyclopedia of Popular Music\", Colin Larkin opined that Wilde tried \"a more adventurous sound\" with \"Cambodia,\" indicating that she was \"an exciting talent.\" The \"Ipswich Star\" Wayne Savage said that \"Cambodia\" and \"Chequered Love\" (1981) are \"seminal smashes\" which prove that Wilde \"struck gold more often than not.\" \"Vogue\" Rachel Hahn called the song an \"underrated classic\".\n\nStewart Mason of AllMusic noted that \"Kim Wilde's second album didn't score any hits on the level of the debut's 'Kids in America,' although the dramatic 'Cambodia' was a sort of cult favorite in some circles.\" Writing for the same website, John Bush called the track a \"fan favorite\" and an \"odd, chilling attempt to record a dirge for Southeastern Asia.\" In \"The Legacies of Jean-Luc Godard\", Douglas Morrey wrote that \"'Cambodia' is not...a particularly moving record\". In his review of \"The Singles Collection 1981–1993\" in \"All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul\", Mike DeGagne wrote that \"Only the unbecoming 'Cambodia' and the hollowed out 'Child Come Away' should be avoided on this collection, as both lack the spirit that Wilde usually packs.\"\n\n\n\n\"Cambodia\" was featured in a scene of Christophe Honoré's film \"Dans Paris\" (2006), wherein the character of Paul sings along to it. It is also played in \"\" (2018).\n"}

In 2004, Peru declared this song as part of the national cultural heritage. This song is now considered the second national anthem of Peru.\n\nIt is the best-known Peruvian song in the English-speaking world due to a 1970 cover by Simon & Garfunkel on their \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" album. Their version is called \"El Cóndor Pasa (If I Could)\".\n\nIn 1913, Peruvian songwriter Daniel Alomía Robles composed \"El Cóndor Pasa\", and the song was first performed publicly at the Teatro Mazzi in Lima. The song was originally a musical piece in the Peruvian zarzuela (musical play), \"El cóndor pasa\".\n\nIts music was composed by Daniel Alomía Robles in 1913 and its script was written by Julio de La Paz (pseudonym of the Limenian dramatist Julio Baudouin). The piano arrangement of this play's most famous melody was legally registered on May 3, 1933 by The Edward B. Marks Music Corp. in the Library of Congress, under the number 9643. The zarzuela is written in prose and consists of one musical play and two acts.\n\nIn July 2013, the Colectivo Cultural Centenario El Cóndor Pasa cultural association re-edited the original script which had been lost for a period of time, and published it together with a CD containing the recorded dialogues and seven musical pieces. The music from the original score was reconstructed by musicologist Luis Salazar Mejía with the collaboration of musicians Daniel Dorival and Claude Ferrier and the support of cultural promoter Mario Cerrón Fetta, and re-released on November 14, 15, and 16, 2013 at the Teatro UNI in Lima to celebrate its first centenary. The zarzuela included the famous homonymous melody, without lyrics, based on the traditional Andean music of Peru, where it was declared a National Cultural Heritage in 2004.\n\nIn 1965, the American musician Paul Simon heard for the first time a version of the melody by the band Los Incas in a performance at the \"Théâtre de l'Est parisien\" in Paris in which both were participating. Simon became friendly with Los Incas band, later even touring with them and producing their first US-American album. He asked the band for permission to use the song in his production. The band's director and founding member Jorge Milchberg, who was collecting royalties for the song as co-author and arranger, responded erroneously that it was a traditional Peruvian composition. Milchberg told Simon he was registered as the arrangement's co-author and collected royalties.\n\nIn 1970, the Simon & Garfunkel duo covered the Los Incas version, adding some English lyrics which in turn added Paul Simon to the author credits under the song name \"El Cóndor Pasa (If I Could)\". The instrumental version by Los Incas was used as the base track. They included the song on the 1970 album \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\". Simon & Garfunkel released their version as a single in the U.S., which reached #18 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart and #6 on the Easy Listening chart, in fall 1970. This cover achieved major international success and fame.\n\nIn regard to the Simon & Garfunkel version, Daniel Alomía Robles, Jorge Milchberg, and Paul Simon are now all listed as songwriters, with Simon listed alone as the author of the English lyrics. However, Daniel Alomía Robles was not originally listed as the composer because Jorge Milchberg had told Simon that the song was considered an Andean folk melody. He further stated that he was the registered co-author and arranger of the composition.\n\nIn late 1970, Daniel Alomía Robles' son Armando Robles Godoy, a Peruvian filmmaker, filed a successful copyright lawsuit against Paul Simon. The grounds for the lawsuit extended that the song had been composed by his father, who had copyrighted the song in the United States in 1933. Armando Robles Godoy said that he held no ill will towards Paul Simon for what he considered a \"misunderstanding\" and an \"honest mistake\".\n\n\"It was an almost friendly court case because Paul Simon was very respectful of other cultures. It was not carelessness on his part,\" said Armando Robles Godoy. \"He happened to hear the song in Paris from a vernacular group Los Incas. He liked it, he went to ask the band for permission and they gave him the wrong information. Jorge Milchberg told him it was a traditional folk song from the 18th century and not my father's composition. It was a court case without further complications.\"\n\nLater that year, Perry Como released a cover of Paul Simon's English version on his album \"It's Impossible\", while Julie Felix had a UK Top 20 hit with it, taking advantage of Simon & Garfunkel's decision not to release their version as a UK single.\n\nArmando Robles Godoy subsequently wrote new Spanish lyrics for the song, taking Paul Simon's version as a reference.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is an example of Byzantine enameling. The box is dated to 843 (some scholars speculate an earlier date of 815). Both dates hover around the second wave of Byzantine Iconoclasm from 814–842, allowing this piece to become a lens into the post iconoclastic art. These reliquaries doubled as an icon in style and purpose. The physical material of icons and the content within the reliquary were believed to contained a spirit or energy. It was believed that reliquaries contained great power, thus explains its preservation throughout the years. There are numerous theories of where this piece was created and its movement. It's currently on display at the Metropolitan Museum.\n\nThe staurotheke is made from gilded silver, gold, enamel worked in cloisonné, and niello. The front lid depicts Christ on the cross wearing a colobium (sleeveless tunic) flanked by Mary and Saint John the Theologian. On either side of Christ head there is a sun and moon and Greek text which says \"Here is your son...Here is your Mother\" and each figure is called out by name; Mother of God, Jesus, and John. Christ eyes are open and appears to be alive which is an important dating factor, as 9th century crucifixion scenes often detailed Christ's eyes closed, a crown of thorns, bleeding hands and feet, and the skull of Adam. \nBordering the Crucifixion scene are 14 saints who are depicted subtly different from one another, starting from the top left going counter clockwise they are: Saint Demetrios, Saint Eustathios, Saint Lawrence, Luke, Mark, Thomas, James, Saint Damiano, Saint Kosmas, Saint Gregory the Miracle-Worker, Bartholomew, Matthew, Jude, and Simon. \n\nUnderneath the lid the surface is divided into four parts and created using niello, the top left, the Annunciation; top right, the Nativity and bathing of Jesus; bottom left, the Crucifixion (which mimics the front lid); and the bottom right, the Anastasis (Christ descent into Hell) scene pulling Adam and Eve out of Hell. Greek text within the scenes translates to, \"Hail, full of grace!\" and \"Here is your son...Here is your mother.\" The lid was only removed by intimate viewers, so these scenes might have been more privileged. \nThe interior of the box is divided by a Patriarchal (double cross) walls which create 5 sections. It is believed to have contained a wooden cross relic that would have fit perfectly within the main section, the 4 surrounding compartments would have contained other Holy relics, such as bones, hair, cloth, etc. \n\nAlong the sides of the box are 13 saints with halos and a golden latch; Saint Anastasios, Saint Nicholas, Saint Platon, Saint Theodore, Saint Prokopios, Saint George, Saint Merkourios, Saint Eustrastios, Saint Panteleimon, Saint Andrew, Saint John, Saint Paul, Saint Peter. The saints along the sides are represented with great variance, despite the approximately one square inch space, making distinguishes between color of eyes, hair style, and facial hair. The base of the container is gold stamped with a dot pattern into a shape of a Latin cross, with circular or disc shaped ends. \n\nOverall, the box is small in size and packs in many narratives and figures. Its cloisonne is considered crude and lettering is botched for Byzantine standards. Other scholars have called it naive and stiff compared to other cloisonné and enamel pieces of that period. The primary colors of the reliquary enamel are emerald green, blue, maroon, gold, and white.\n\nArtisans were persecuted, like the story of Lazarus whose hands were burnt after defying to destroy and renounce his craft. The Fieschi Morgan Staurotheke is an object that offers one perspective of art created after the decline in religious crafts. The trade of skilled artisans needed to be outsourced beyond the Byzantine empire and outside the purge of figurative art. Rome continued to create and explore art techniques and played a role reeducating Byzantine artists. Rome is a source for enamel art as the colors used in the Fieschi Morgan Staurotheke were in production there and the city was a place of refuge for iconophiles. It is most popularly believed that this was created in the shadows from iconoclasm or just after iconoclasm in Constantinople.\nThe reliquary could have arrived in Italy by the Crusaders in 1204, as many precious art pieces entered western Europe. It was also common that monks traveling west would give gifts to the monasteries. A theory of the relic being separated from the reliquary was due to its poor craftsmanship or creation by an immature student and was not worthy to house the true cross relic. The relic was taken out and worn on a necklace by Pope Innocent IV. Pope Innocent IV presented the relic to his new basilica, San Salvatore di Lavagna, in 1245 (where it still resides) and the box became an heirloom of the Fieschi Family. \nThe relic and reliquary have never been put together. Based on the dimensions presented of the reliquary and cross relic here is a diagram that shows that the relic could fit within the reliquary.\n\nAnother theory is that the reliquary was never brought to the west but was created in the west. Evidence of enamel coloring and the art practice being revived in Rome supports this theory.

In Hong Kong, the show aired under the title 電子神童, which translates to \"Electronic Prodigy\". The series was considered iconic in Asia , since it came at a time when the public was being exposed to video games for the first time. The manga and TV series opened the imagination and possibilities of what gaming entertainment was about, while boosting its popularity as a new phenomenon.\n\nThe story is about a young boy named Arashi Ishino who is obsessed with video games. He would spend all his time trying to beat the games and conquer the local arcades. He would meet competitors like Satoru Daimonji and Ishii, who would try to out match him with higher scores. At a certain point in each episode, he would display his special skill of unleashing a top which will spin so fast that both the top and his hands would catch on fire. On release, the spin would land on or near the cabinet panels, turning the ordinary button into a turbo button thus giving him a major advantage. His appearance is known for being bucktoothed, and he always wears a hat labeled \"Arashi\" with a picture of a sprited alien.\n\n\"Game Center Arashi\" was the first animation with a gamer as the lead character and have the plot revolve around life with competitive gaming. Some of the games featured in the show include Space Invaders, Breakout, Galaxian, though they were not explicitly named. Some of Arashi's gaming techniques even have special names like \"Blazed Top\", \"Vacuum Hurricane Shot\", \"Fish Stance\".\n\n\nIn 1999, the series spawned a PlayStation novel called Game Center Arashi R. In 2004 Microsoft Tokyo used the character of Arashi as a mascot to boost Xbox sales and image.\n\nWhile the 2002 manga Arcade Gamer Fubuki reused the concept of a powerful gamer in the arcades, and also spawned a TV series of the same name, that show used entirely different characters and plots, modernizing while separating itself from the 1982 counterpart.\n\nIn 2006 the Let's TV Play Classic series of Plug and Plays used Arashi as a mascot.\n\n"}

Burroughs from 1953 to 1958. The collection was first published by Viking Penguin in 1989, although several of the stories had already been printed elsewhere, including an earlier publication titled \"Early Routines\". The title was inspired by the International Zone in Tangiers, Morocco, where Burroughs lived for a time and by which he was greatly influenced.\n\nA notable inclusion is \"Twilight's Last Gleamings\", written in 1938 in collaboration with childhood friend Kells Elvins, and widely thought to be Burroughs' first attempt at fiction. The villain of the piece, Doctor Benway, was to play a pivotal role in \"Naked Lunch\". (This story differs from another Burroughs piece titled \"Twilight's Last Gleamings,\" which was published in the 1970s collection, \"Exterminator!\".)\n\n\"Interzone\" features many characters and concepts that would manifest themselves in \"Naked Lunch\", \"Nova Express\" and others. At one point, Interzone was considered as a title for \"Naked Lunch\". Moreover, the concluding section entitled \"WORD\" was part of the original \"Naked Lunch\" manuscript but was cut during the editing process (according to the introduction by editor James Grauerholz).\n\nSeveral of the short pieces were adapted into other media. Burroughs recorded the stories \"The Junky's Christmas\" and \"Spare Ass Annie,\" which were set to music and released on the album \"Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales\". \"The Junky's Christmas\" was also adapted as an animated film in the 1990s.\n\nThe book is divided into three sections:\n\n\n\nAs noted above, this is a novella-length story that was originally part of the \"Naked Lunch\" manuscript when it was entitled \"Interzone\". \n"}

It is built from brick, covered in white plaster and decorated with profiled cornice. The tower has three stories covered with tinned cupola and gilded cross on top. Ceilings of the ground and the first floors were originally wooden, but were later replaced by stone, thus increasing tower fire resistance. The tower height from the ground to the tip of the cross is 25 meters, its other dimensions decrease with height being 9,0 x 7,3 meters at the ground level and 8,5 x 7,0 meters on the first floor level. Octagonal walls have windows for shotguns and small cannons. The tower had a gallery on the monastery side, supported by wooden consoles connected to the general system of defensive walls. The upper tier of the tower has a semicircular window openings. The structure is built in a Kiev style of Ukrainian Baroque.\n\nThe tower was built between 1696 and 1701. It was heavily damaged by the great Lavra fire of 1718. Historic documents state that three towers with churches, among them St. John Kushchik, were set to be renovated in 1721, along other restorations of Lavra, but the plan was not realized until 1797. However, there was some maintenance before that – in 1785 the tower received a tin roof.\n\nIn 1918 the tower was damaged again – this time from the explosion at Zvirinets, then repaired the same year. Major renovations in 20th century were done in 1953 and in 1972. The last one was carried out under supervision of art historian V. Pidgora and architect A. Kulagin. During that renovation the lower walls and vaults of the tower were strengthened, the windows of the top floor and tier under cupola were reopened, and the cross re-gilded.\n\n"}
{"id": "10110080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10110080", "title": "Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe", "text": "Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe\n\nJeremy Gilbert-Rolfe (born UK 1945, US resident since 1968) is a painter, art critic, theorist, and educator. His work is in the permanent collections of the Albright-Knox Gallery of Art, Buffalo, NY; The Getty Study Center, Los Angeles; the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami; the Frederick R. Weisman Foundation in Los Angeles and Minneapolis; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and other public, corporate and private collections.\n\nGilbert-Rolfe has shown in New York fairly regularly since 1970, and sporadically elsewhere. \nRegarding the general consensus that describes his work as ‘Geometric Abstraction,’ Gilbert-Rolfe says he wishes people would think about what he does with the category rather than how his work fits into it. He says he went to an exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London in 1963 to see the Pop art that was in it but what caught his attention instead, causing him to decide he needed to go to America, were the paintings of the New York School and especially and specifically Barnett Newman’s Vir Heroicus Sublimis (1951.) The space in it felt as active as the space in Howard Hawkes’ Red River, which had entered his imagination when he was a child and stayed there. Rachel Kushner discusses his indebtedness to Newman and Hawkes, and much else in the work and practice, going on to say that she made an “automatic and instinctive” association of his painting Hottest Part of the Day (2001) with a poem of Sappho’s, and that it is her “sense that Gilbert-Rolfe has some uncanny mesh with feminine sensibilities… (His) electric verdure pulses—seductive, then bewildering, then seductive. Boucher, then radiator coolant, then Boucher.” \nFlattered by Kushner’s suggestion, he is however inclined to resist her further suggestion that “A line is a kind of violence, cutting the canvas as though it’s cutting a body. But color is violence as well, if of a soft, smothering sort. A smothering of reason.” Aside from wondering whether a drawn line doesn’t only divide but also connect, he is unwilling to accept the smothering of reason part. He says “his paintings are about complexity and as such have come to be about logic as much as anything else. Not logic as in philosophy, logic as in music, where one talks of it making sense but does not mean it provides a riddle and its answer. I want the work to interact with the viewer, to take place in the space around itself and between itself and the person looking at it, and to hold the attention for some time.” He has also said that seriousness is generally identified with terror, “but I want to identify it with questions of the formless… Art has to put you in touch with something that’s not manageable…. (but) it’s time to get rid of … tough-guy rhetoric about the sublime. Among other things, it would permit us to get closer to the sublime or sublimes that tough guys are too scared to touch.” As Kushner puts it, “Gilbert-Rolfe … lays out his ante, but never knows where a painting will go.” \nIn 2010 he and Rebecca Norton began to work together as the collaboration Awkward x 2, making paintings together and also writing occasional blogs. Awkward has shown in Brooklyn, Chicago and Louisville to date.\n\nGilbert-Rolfe writes about art and related topics, including poetry, fiction, fashion, with particular regard to its interaction with photography, technology, and the general state of things in art and how the present situation seems to have emerged. His publications include two anthologies of his essays, a book about Frank Gehry’s architecture co-authored with the architect, \"Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime\", and other essays and reviews. \n\"Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime\" reformulates the traditional definition of the differential relationship between beauty and the sublime, in which beauty is a sign of the passive and feminine and the sublime of the active and male—heroic or terrifying depending on one’s perspective, or of course both. In Gilbert-Rolfe’s version Winckelmann’s masculine active becomes instead androgynous transitivity, while intransitivity replaces passivity as a still entirely feminine characteristic, the feminine as intransitivity being a sign or force that stands for, or embodies, power as a kind of powerlessness. As well as redefining the differential, \"Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime\"’s argument also relocates the sublime from nature to technology, and with it subjectivity, from wherever it imagined itself to be to within techno-capitalism. Here and elsewhere Gilbert-Rolfe suggests that techno-capitalism and the subjectivity that accompanies it are largely made out of all that Heidegger warns against and denounces in his post-war essays on technology, for example the telephone’s capacity to sever the mutual dependence of space and time. He has returned to some aspects of this argument in two essays in particular. \nStarting out in Artforum, in 1973, he has written something at least once for most of the art magazines over the years, and more often for Critical Inquiry and Bomb. A founding editor of October, with Rosalind Krauss, Annette Michelson and Lucio Pozzi (who withdrew before the first issue was published,) Gilbert-Rolfe resigned from the journal after the third issue.\n\nFor painting, Gilbert-Rolfe has been honored by two National Endowment for the Arts fellowships (1979, 1989,) a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship (1997,) the Francis Greenberger Award (2001,) and a Pollock-Krasner Fellowship (2017.) He was awarded an NEA fellowship in criticism in 1974 and was the 1998 recipient of the College Art Association’s Frank Jewett Mather Award for Art and Architectural Criticism.\n\nGilbert-Rolfe retired from teaching at Art Center College of Design in 2015 receiving the title Professor/Chair Emeritus. He had worked there since 1986, when he was hired to develop an MFA program for the school; before that he taught at Princeton and Cal Arts.\n\nGilbert-Rolfe has been married twice and has two children, Cyrus, from his first marriage to Jennifer, and Cedric from the second to Annie. Between them his sons have generated three grandchildren, Harley, Leiah, and Vincent (formerly Maisie.) Having lived in New York and Los Angeles for forty years, he and Annie now live in Gainesville, Florida. They have a large garden.\n\n"}

She first gained notice in 1992 as a member of the group Xscape. She won a Grammy Award for Best R&B Song for her writing contributions on the TLC hit song \"No Scrubs\". She currently stars in the Bravo reality television series \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" since its second season premiere on July 30, 2009.\n\nBurruss was born in College Park, Georgia, the daughter of the Reverend Titus Burruss Jr. and Joyce Jones. She had an older brother, Patrick Riley, who died in 1991 in a car crash at age 22.\n\nBurruss attended Tri-Cities High School in East Point, Georgia, graduating in 1994. She first appeared on the BET series, \"Teen Summit\", at age 15.\n\nPrior to joining Xscape, LaTocha \nScott had been performing with a group called Precise. While attending Tri-Cities performing arts high school in East Point, Georgia, Scott's sister Tamika met Kandi Burruss. The three began singing together and recruited a fourth member, Tamera Coggins, though her time with the group was short-lived. Soon Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle was asked to audition for the girls, and Xscape was officially formed. After the group's major debut performance at BET's Teen Summit in 1992, the girls were introduced to record executive Ian Burke, who later became the group’s manager. Xscape soon caught the attention of Jermaine Dupri, who later signed the group to his recording label So So Def Recordings.\n\nThe group released their debut album, \"Hummin' Comin' at 'Cha\", on October 12, 1993. The album peaked at number seventeen the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 and number three on the Top R&B Albums chart. It was a critical and commercial success, certified platinum within a year, and launched two top ten singles.\n\nAfter their debut albums success, Xscape released their second studio album, \"Off the Hook\", in 1995. The lead single, \"Feels So Good\", reached the top forty of the US Hot 100, while \"Who Can I Run To\" peaked at number eight. The album eventually went platinum.\nTheir third and final studio album \"Traces of My Lipstick\" debuted at twenty-eight on the Billboard 200 and at six on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop album chart; over a million copies were sold in the U.S. The album featured the top ten hit \"The Arms of the One Who Loves You\", which reached number seven on the Hot 100 chart, and \"My Little Secret\", which reached nine. After \"Traces of My Lipstick\", LaTocha Scott initially left the group to pursue a solo career. The ladies soon regrouped and made appearances on the \"Big Momma's House\" and \"Hardball\" soundtracks, before going on another hiatus until 2005.\n\nIn 2017, TV One had planned to produce an unauthorized movie about Xscape which Kandi Burruss did not want to happen against her and the group's legacy. She called other band members to discuss starting a show of their own. The show was named Xscape: Still Kickin’ It, and it was set as a 4-episode miniseries. The show was launched on November 5, 2017 and is aired on BravoTV. Before Kandi could rejoin the group, she wanted an apology from band member Tamika Scott claiming in a 2007 interview that Burruss broke up the group by sleeping with their label head Jermaine Dupri and his father, Michael Mauldin. Kandi wanted an apology for the false statement that Scott told, but did confirm that she and Dupri had been involved (though Burruss claims that wasn't the reason why the group broke up). Kandi got an apology from Tamika.\n\nAfter the disbanding of Xscape, Burruss focused on production and songwriting. In 1999, Burruss teamed with groupmate Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle to score the international number one hit \"No Scrubs\" for TLC. That same year, Burruss wrote another song, \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" for Destiny's Child. Burruss would go on to work with Pink by co-writing her debut single \"There You Go.\" Burruss was the first African-American woman to win the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers's Songwriter of the Year award in 2000. This award, in the Rhythm & Soul category, was given for her songwriting credits such as Destiny's Child's \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" and TLC's \"No Scrubs.\" In 2000, Kandi had released her debut album entitled \"Hey Kandi...\" with well known singles including \"Don't Think I'm Not\". The album did not do as well on the chart as the single did, scoring #72 on the US Billboard 200.\n\nBurruss rewrote and executive produced the song \"Tardy for the Party\" for her \"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" co-star Kim Zolciak. On March 12, 2013, Kandi Burruss, and her collaborating songwriter/producer, Rodney \"Don Vito\" Richard, filed suit against Zolciak for profits earned from \"Tardy for the Party\". In the documents filed, Burruss' attorney, \"RHOA\" castmate Phaedra Parks, alleges her clients wrote the song for Zolciak and that Zolciak released and sold the single \"without [the] plaintiffs' authorization, license or consent.\" Burruss was also seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent future sales of the song and the \"destruction of all copies of the infringing single and any other product of defendant's that infringe plaintiffs' copyrights\", punitive damages, attorney's fees, and a jury trial.\n\nFollowing a hiatus from music Burrus released her debut EP, the \"Fly Above EP\", on October 29, 2009. By December 2009, Burruss announced she had signed a deal with Asylum Records after her deal with Capitol Records fell through. Her second album, \"Kandi Koated\", was released in December 2010. Burruss also teamed with Atlanta female rapper Rasheeda to form the duo Peach Candy.\nIn 2017, Ed Sheeran released his hugely successful single Shape of You. The song's lyrical rhythm drew comparisons to the TLC song \"No Scrubs\", particularly in the pre-chorus line, \"Boy, let's not talk too much/ Grab on my waist and put that body on me.\" As a result, Kandi Burruss, Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle, and Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs, were awarded co-writing credits on \"Shape of You\".\n\nIn March 2009, Entertainment Weekly reported that Burruss would replace DeShawn Snow in the second season of \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\". The introduction of Burruss, saw various storylines, initially she had recently become engaged to her boyfriend A.J. and expressed interest in reviving her music career. A feud developed between Nene Leakes and Burruss after the latter became friends with Zolciak and helped her record her single \"Tardy for the Party\". Burrus returned for the third season which saw, Zolciak and Burruss continue recording music together, although they clashed over their creative differences. A conflict between Burruss, Leakes, and Zolciak later ensued while the latter two women embark on a promotional concert tour. In later seasons, Burruss struck up a friendship with castmates Phaedra Parks and Porsha Williams, even starring the latter a role in her production of A Mother's Love, a play Burruss and her husband had created and produced. Sometime during her pregnancy with son Ace, a rift was shown between Phaedra and Kandi, eventually souring due to unpaid production fees that Parks owed Tucker.\n\nBurrus received the second spin-off from \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\". Originally planned as a one-time television special, \"The Kandi Factory\" was launched as the second spin-off from \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" in 2012. It followed Burruss and her record producers as they attempted to launch the music careers of undiscovered artists, although it was confirmed in 2013 that the series was canceled after airing one season. \nBravo announced Burruss and Tucker's wedding spin-off, \"Kandi's Wedding\", on April 8, 2014. The series premiered on June 1, 2014, and concluded on July 6, 2014. \"Kandi's Wedding\" brought in very high ratings for Bravo, and topped NeNe Leakes and Kim Zolciak's previous spin-offs. The network later announced another series titled \"Kandi's Ski Trip\", the third offshoot starring Burruss. The three-part special premiered after the conclusion of the seventh season of \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\".\n\nBurruss has made cameo appearances on series such as \"Single Ladies\", \"\", \"Chef Roblé & Co.\", and \"Let's Stay Together\". \nBurruss also owns a sex toy company called \"Bedroom Kandi\". Burruss and four friends started a \"sex and relationship\" web series on Ustream, \"Kandi Koated Nights\". The show started on television in 2018.\n\nBurruss and her ex-boyfriend, Russell \"Block\" Spencer of Block Entertainment, have a daughter named Riley Burruss born August 22, 2002.\n\nIn late 2008, Burruss began a relationship with Ashley \"A.J.\" Jewell and after dating several months, the couple became engaged in January 2009. However, on October 22, 2009, after sustaining head injuries in a brawl, Jewell died.\n\nOn January 15, 2013, Burruss announced via Twitter that she was engaged to Todd Tucker, a former line producer for \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\", whom she had been dating since 2011 while filming the fourth season. On April 4, 2014, the couple got married. On July 22, 2015, Burruss announced that she was pregnant. On January 6, 2016, the couple welcomed their son, Ace Wells Tucker.\n\nKandi and her husband reside in Atlanta with their daughters, Kaela Tucker and Riley Burruss; and their son, Ace Tucker.\n\nBurruss is a member of the Church of Holiness and believes in God.\n\n\n"}

It still occasionally airs reruns on Teletoon and was briefly aired by MTV and MTV2 in 2003.\n\nAccording to co-creator Miller the reason for putting historical figures in a school setting was that \"We chose these characters because they're sort of mythic figures, even people with a very limited knowledge of history have some preconceived ideas about them, which is part of the fun.\" Lord adds, \"The point of the whole show is that these people are not living up to their genetic forebears.\" Lord and Miller also explained that the development of the character of Gandhi as a \" party animal\" was because they researched that the young Gandhi was \"immature\" and \"into partying\" before witnessing the suffering in South Africa.

He is the main protagonist of the series, and most of the episodes are seen through his point of view. Abe is an average, awkward, naive, shy, clumsy yet kind teenager who feels he is struggling to live up to the legacy of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nHe has been friends with Gandhi since they were babies and also good friends with Joan. Throughout season one Abe desperately pursued Cleopatra, his love interest; at first she used him but he had eventually won her love and becomes her boyfriend starting at the end of the episode \"Sleep of Faith\" in which she agreed to go out with him after he won a drag race (despite the fact Cleo ditched him to be with JFK), they did not start a real relationship until the episode \"Plane Crazy\".\n\nAbe is very skinny and physically weak to complement his weak-willed and indecisive nature and he is claimed to weigh only 104 pounds despite being one of the tallest students in the school. He is often seen to fall into peer pressure despite his moral values. Though intelligent, he is very unaware when it comes to other people's feelings, as he regularly insulted his friend Joan without even realizing it. He has a bitter rivalry with JFK, mostly involving his attempts to win over Cleopatra and a possible joke to one president being Republican and the other Democrat. Another reason for their rivalry is because JFK is secretly angry over how Abe treats Joan on a daily basis in his attempt to win Cleopatra over.\n\nHe is unaware that his best friend Joan of Arc is in love with him, and even when she makes advances upon him or professes her love, he seems obstinately stuck in viewing her as his \"girl friend, not his girlfriend\", even to the point of improbably re-interpreting some of her statements and actions as gestures of friendship or humor(something of which JFK is angry about). In the series finale, Abe realizes his feelings for Joan are more than platonic. However, this was only after Cleopatra had given her an involuntary make-over for the prom and the anger he feels when he finds Joan with JFK. Before, Abe was oblivious to the fact that Cleo is attempting to drive a wedge between him and Joan and Gandhi, who she views as being detrimental to her image. When alone with Cleo, he found himself thinking about Joan more. Eventually, Abe realizes her true nature in driving away his friends and sees Cleo for the shallow person she is inside. After ending his relationship with Cleo, he rushes to Joan's house to tell her the truth of his feelings for her. By the time he got there to tell her, Abe discovers to his dismay that Joan has moved on and is in a relationship with JFK.\n\nHe is 16 years old. He drives a white 1960s-esque Lincoln Continental. He is captain of the basketball team because he is the tallest guy at school and on the cross country team though it is clear he lacks athleticism, and he is the president of the anti-drug club. His famous catchphrase is \"Dinger!\" often said out of great excitement or frustration.\n\nAbe is usually seen wearing a white T-shirt with a blue collar and blue sleeves, long, baggy cargo jeans and sneakers. He is very tall, skinny and gangly. He has messy brown hair and a scruffy black chin-strap beard (without a mustache) and a mole on his left cheek\n\nVoice by Will Forte. \"The Lego Movie\" references Clone High by casting Forte as the voice of Lego Abe Lincoln.\n\nJoan of Arc is the clone of Jeanne d'Arc, the devout 15th century French militant. She is Abe's closest friend and is obviously in love with him (everyone knows it except Abe himself), though his constant ignorance of this causes her a lot of frustration.\n\nIn the episode \"ADD: The Last D Stands for Disorder\" Joan admits to being a \"goth\" and has a very moody, cynical, aloof, sarcastic and angst-ridden personality. She has a tendency to erupt melodramatically into tears, usually when Abe ignores her advances or scores with Cleopatra. She hates Cleopatra considering her to be a bimbo and a snob but develops a special hatred when Cleo starts dating Abe and when she is forced to live with Cleo because her house burnt down. Joan prefers to confide in various characters such as Mr. Butlertron, Gandhi, and Jesus Cristo when she needs emotional support, though she also frequently allows Abe to obliviously confide in her regarding his infatuation with Cleo and their amorous affairs together, much to her emotional detriment.\n\nJoan is also very intelligent, well-read, witty and highly ethical and will speak up for what she believes in, though she is always ignored by the others as they see her as being too \"outspoken\". She serves as an environmentalist, a vegetarian and activist. mated to be attractive, though she does not recognize or emphasize this and dutifully wears an orthodontic retainer. Joan has proven to appeal to the other male characters, notably JFK whom frequently harasses her. Despite this, he is secretly attracted to Joan not only because she is immune to his charms, but also he is the only one who sees more to her as a person than Abe. In the Series Finale after realizing that Abe will never see her more than a friend, JFK comforts Joan and takes her to the prom with him. It's there that she realizes her feelings for JFK and sees more to him than the arrogant jock he usually displays in front of others. When Abe came over to her house to finally tell her the truth that he is in love with her, Joan has moved on and begins a relationship with JFK. \n\nShe is 16 years old. She is an agnostic (she rejects religion but is not disinclined to accepting the existence of God), which puts her at odds with the real Jeanne d'Arc who was a devout Christian (this was once explained by feeling unable to live up to the real Jeanne d'Arc). Joan makes home-movies to express herself artistically. In the episode \"Makeover, Makeover, Makeover\", Abe prints flyers of her in order to get her a date for the prom and the flyer describes her as \"Janeane Garofaloesque\".\n\nJoan's appearance consists of a tight black long-sleeved shirt and tight green cargo pants with black boots. She has pale skin, dark red hair, wears black eye liner, purple lipstick and a black choker around her neck. When Cleo gave her a makeover, she wore a different hairstyle, purple eyeshadow and eyeliner, red lipstick a tight black sleeveless leather minidress with a black and red, lacey pushup bra being revealed, fishnet stockings and higheels to highlight her shapely physique. In her original design, she had black hair.\n\nVoice by Nicole Sullivan.\n\nGandhi is the clone of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the Indian activist of the Indian Revolution. Gandhi is a hyperactive, funny, talkative, immature and rather mischievous teenager who wants to be accepted by those around him.\n\nThe reason for his often-ridiculous behavior and underachieving in academics is because he thinks he cannot live up to the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi. Though he has a somewhat likable and friendly personality, his outrageous behavior tends to offend and annoy others. He is a close friend of Abe and at times a confidant to Joan when he is not annoying her. Gandhi knows Joan likes Abe but does not say anything for Joan's privacy.\n\nGandhi believes he is a friend of the popular students and he especially wants to be best friends with JFK in order to be popular by association. He and JFK had three episodes in which they interacted, JFK admitted that he liked Gandhi as a friend in the episode \"Makeover, Makeover, Makeover\". Gandhi also erroneously believes himself to be a ladies man though no females are attracted to him except for Marie Curie but he did gain the attraction of several ladies when he briefly got a makeover as \"GFK\". In the series finale, Gandhi realizes his feelings for Marie and they begin a platonic relationship.\n\nIt is revealed that he used to be Cleo's foster brother for 10 years until she told her parents that he was hurting her image so he was disowned and later placed in the care of new foster parents, a stereotypical Jewish couple (despite the fact that Gandhi donated his kidney to Cleo when she was in terrible pain, something she seems to ignore). He is 16 years old. He is also very short for his age much to his own dismay (even having to use a booster seat when riding in a car). His favorite movie is \"American Pie\" and according to the 2003 MTV website, he is the associate editor of the school newspaper \"The Tatler\" in which he reviews movies. Gandhi is called by various nicknames notably \"G-spot\" and \"G-force\". He also is school's mascot DNA Dan and the treasurer for the Solid Gandhi Dancers.\n\nGandhi appearance consist of a gray short-sleeved shirt with a red stripe, blue jeans and white and red sneakers. He stands very short, is very skinny (almost to the point of looking emaciated) and has dark, swarthy skin. He is bald, wears glasses and has a black mustache and beard. He also wears a gold earring on his right ear.\n\nHis portrayal as a party animal enraged many in India, including prominent members of India's parliament.\n\nVoice by actor Michael McDonald.\n\nCleopatra Smith is the clone of Cleopatra VII, the last Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt. Cleopatra or \"Cleo\" is a beautiful, intelligent and popular student who is more commonly known as Abe's initial love interest.\n\nShe is a very selfish, snobby, cynical, vain, manipulative, pretentious and materialistic stereotypical school diva who cares only about her social image, beauty and popularity. She shows very little consideration for other people's feelings and believes she deserves to be treated like a queen among her peers. She is also an overachiever who frequently covets success in order to fit into her \"queen bee\" status. It is shown that she acts the way she does out of intense insecurity, and because she has an abusive foster mother who openly harbors contempt towards Cleo. She used to date JFK, but only because she thought he was good for her image.\n\nShe became Abe's girlfriend since the episode \"Plane Crazy\". Cleo is portrayed as seductive, hedonistic and libidinous, as result she is sexually promiscuous and hates it when people make of fun of it, especially when Joan does it to spite her. Cleo has always been aware that Joan harbors strong feelings for Abe, and will often warn Joan to stay away from him after she and Abe began dating. When she discovered JFK's feelings for Joan, Cleo encouraged him to pursue her. In the Series Finale, when Abe was about to have sex with Cleo after prom, he begins to realize his feelings for Joan. After seeing how Cleo had been mistreating both her and Gandhi, Abe ends his relationship to her and leaves.\n\nDespite her arrogance and mean-spirited nature she shows a limited ability of compassion as she willingly gave Joan a makeover to help boost her confidence, she gave up some of her vanity to date the obviously unpopular student Abe Lincoln and consoled JFK when he was sad about Poncey's death.\n\nShe is 16 years old. She is captain of the cheerleading team and is the Campus Life editor for \"The Tatler\" in which she interviews students and guest stars. Her physical appearance is derived from the wall paintings of Ancient Egyptian women. She is portrayed as being a tan Egyptian girl which contradicts with the fact the real Cleopatra was of Macedonian descent.\n\nCleo wears a blue (sometimes red or orange depending on her outfit) headband, a white tank top which shows her large cleavage and a tight black miniskirt to show her volumptuous figure and wears pumps. At night she sleeps in sexy purple lingerie and is sometimes seen in her cheerleading uniform at school. At the prom she wore a tight, revealing and seductive red dress and a black minidress at Poncey's funeral.\n\nVoice by actress Christa Miller, the wife of Clone High producer Bill Lawrence.\n\nJFK is the clone of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States. JFK is the stereotypical popular high school jock. He is arrogant, competitive, lecherous, vain and at times dimwitted. He initially antagonized Abe and Gandhi but he later befriends them by the end of the series. However, JFK and Abe maintained a bitter rivalry, mainly due to them wanting to win over Cleopatra over in the early episodes. This later changed when JFK realizes that he is in love with Joan and despises the way Abe callously treats her by ignoring her feelings for him.\n\nIt is shown in episodes \"Episode Two: Election Blue-galoo\" and in \"Raisin the Stakes\", that JFK is a very good speaker. He speaks with a thick, stereotypical, non-rhotic New England dialect and a Boston accent (a parody of the Kennedy accent) that is exaggerated and monotone for a comical effect (he usually switches \"-er\" suffix with \"-ah\" and also uses \"er\" and \"uh\" as filler which occur during mid-sentence). Despite his apparent macho exterior he is very sensitive, emotional and easily offended. JFK is known for his narcissism and his libido. He also has a penchant for using dirty jokes and innuendo. Despite this, JFK has been known to be very compassionate towards others.\n\nDespite being accident-prone, a target of physical harm and losing his best friend Poncey to a freak accident: he does not believe in the Kennedy curse - \"Nothing bad ever happens to the Kennedys\" and \"I'm a Kennedy, I'm not accustomed to tragedy\". His plan of living up to John F. Kennedy is simply by being a womanizer and he is shown to be attractive to women, he seems not to know much about his clonefather besides that he conquered the moon. It is shown that he likes Joan, which is possibly because she is one of the few girls that is immune to his charm. Another reason why JFK likes her is because she is more compassionate and has always seen more to her than Abe did. In the Series Finale, he comforts Joan and takes her to the prom with his other prom dates. However, they leave him when they realize JFK and Joan are in love with each other. It is at prom and later at Joan's home that they begin a relationship, much to Abe's detest.\n\nHe is 16 years old. He mainly drives a yellow van but in the episode \"Sleep of Faith\" drove a 1950s-esque corvette which was destroyed. He also seems to have a fear of sudden movements and friendly \"hand gun\" gestures as he constantly ducks, probably as a cruel joke about the John F. Kennedy assassination. He questioned his sexuality when he became attracted to \"John Dark\" (Joan in drag). He is the captain of the football team and soccer team. When he gets hit by Joan, he yells out \"Bobby!\", a reference to Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nJFK is seen wearing a red sweater with a white stripe in the center and on his sleeves, over a white shirt and tight khaki pants with brown loafers. He has tall, full brown hair and has a fit and muscular physique. His eyes are usually half-open but will get bigger whenever he is shocked, angered or upset. He appears as very healthy even though the real John F. Kennedy suffered a variety of sicknesses from birth (including Addison's disease).\n\nVoice by Christopher Miller. Miller had to study the speeches of John F. Kennedy in order to perfect the voice and the accent.\n\nPrincipal Cinnamon J. Scudworth, Ph.D. is a deluded, self-aggrandizing megalomaniac of a scientist who always wears rubber dish-gloves and if absolutely horrible at being a principal, he is always trying to betray the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures and use the clones for his own convoluted schemes, his favorite being a clone themed amusement park.\n\nHe is shown to have very little control over his emotions and is prone to violent outbursts. It's possible he is an atheist because he once said \"so, religion is for fools?...fools and liberals\". As seen in the opening theme, there is a photo of him and Mr. Butlertron salvaging the remains of Abraham Lincoln, which implies that he was the one along with Mr. B who had dug the corpses of the people in the mid-1980s who would later be used in the cloning experiment.\n\nScudworth apparently had a son named \"Brian Parker Scudworth\" who he bet in a basketball game against the principal of GESH and lost, as a result Brian ended up getting eaten.\n\nHe is seen wearing glasses, a long white lab coat, yellow rubber gloves (which he never takes off), underneath his coat are black pants and shoes. He has brown hair with a bald spot and a small soul patch under his lower lip.\n\nVoice by Phil Lord.\n\nMr. Lynn Butlertron is the loyal robot servant and best friend/roommate to Scudworth who is programmed with a highly sensitive compassion protocol (a parody of Mr. Belvedere). Also known as Mr. B. He calls everyone \"Wesley\", a reference to the youngest son on Mr. Belvedere, Wesley Owens. Strangely, even though he is a robot, Mr. Butlertron is shown without his mustache in a photograph taken in the 80s in the opening to the show and he also has chest hair and armpit hair as shown when he took off his red cardigan sweater vest. Though he is usually polite and laid-back, he does have a temper which came out when had a fight with Scangrade and when he showed jealousy towards Ecybo Pooch.\n\nMr. Butlertron is very human-like being programmed to be highly sentient (though its unknown on how he can feel physical sensations) and possesses artificial intelligence that which enables him to show human emotions, have free will and have facial expressions. He genuinely cares for Scudworth and the students.\n\nVoice by Christopher Miller.\n\nThe Secret Board of Shadowy Figures is a ruthless and secretive government organization who employs Principal Scudworth and is sponsored by Puma. They appear as a parody of the CIA, Secret Service, NSA and Area 51. They were responsible for the creation of the clones in the mid-80's. Their ultimate aim is to use the clones for a super army. The organization consists primarily of aged white male agents.\n\nIts chief director is referred to as The Shadowy Figure (voiced by Bill Lawrence). He is aware of Scudworth's craziness and incompetence in running Clone High. Though for the most part, he has shown amnesty as he gave Scudworth numerous times to redeem himself. He finally decides to kill Scudworth and takes the clones away for experimentation after discovering his video tape of his plot to betray the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures and create \"Cloney Island\". He also secretly hired many celebrities to spy on the clones and Scudworth. He may be lactose intolerant.\n\nThey all wear blue paramilitary uniforms complete with ribbon bars and in the \"Episode Two\" they are seen wearing Pumas sneakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Clone High\" is praised for its high character development and strong voice acting. Charles Soloman of the LA Times wrote that, \"Will Forte's ingenuous Abraham Lincoln and Nicole Sullivan's resigned Joan of Arc steal the show.\"\n"}

The period followed the end of the Byzantine iconoclasm and lasted until the fall of the Macedonian dynasty, which ruled the Byzantine Empire from 867 to 1056, having originated in Macedonia in the Balkans. It coincided with the Ottonian Renaissance in Western Europe. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Byzantine Empire's military situation improved, and art and architecture revived. \nNew churches were again commissioned, and the Byzantine church mosaic style became standardised. The best preserved examples are at the Hosios Lukas Monastery in mainland Greece and the Nea Moni Katholikon in the island of Chios. The very freely painted frescos at Castelseprio in Italy are linked by many art historians to the art of Constantinople of the period also. \n\nThere was a revival of interest in classical Greco-Roman styles and subjects, of which the Paris Psalter is an important testimony, and more sophisticated techniques were used to depict human figures. There was also a naturalistic style and more complex techniques from ancient Greek and Roman art mixed with Christian themes used in art.\n\nAlthough monumental sculpture is extremely rare in Byzantine art, the Macedonian period saw the unprecedented flourishing of the art of ivory sculpture. Many ornate ivory triptychs and diptychs survive, with the central panel often representing either deesis (as in the Harbaville Triptych) or the Theotokos (as in a triptych at Luton Hoo, dating from the reign of Nicephorus Phocas). On the other hand, ivory caskets (notably the Veroli Casket from Victoria and Albert Museum) often feature secular motifs true to the Hellenistic tradition, thus testifying to an undercurrent of classical taste in Byzantine art.\n\nThere are few important surviving buildings from the period. It is presumed that Basil I's votive church of the Theotokos of the Pharos (no longer extant) served as a model for most cross-in-square sanctuaries of the period, including the monastery church of Hosios Lukas in Greece (ca. 1000), the Nea Moni of Chios (a pet project of Constantine IX), and the Daphni Monastery near Athens (ca. 1050).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11928415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11928415", "title": "Madonna of Chancellor Rolin", "text": "Madonna of Chancellor Rolin\n\nThe Madonna of Chancellor Rolin is an oil painting by the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck, dating from around 1435. It is kept in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, and was commissioned by Nicolas Rolin, aged 60, chancellor of the Duchy of Burgundy, whose votive portrait takes up the left side of the picture, for his parish church, \"Notre-Dame-du-Chastel\" in Autun, where it remained until the church burnt down in 1793. After a period in Autun Cathedral, it was moved to the Louvre in 1805.\n\nThe scene depicts the Virgin Mary crowned by a hovering Angel while she presents the Infant Jesus to Rolin. It is set within a spacious loggia with a rich decoration of columns and bas-reliefs. In the background is a landscape with a city on a river, probably intended to be Autun in Burgundy, Rolin's hometown. A wide range of well detailed palaces, churches, an island, a towered bridge, hills and fields is portrayed, subject to a uniform light. Perhaps some of the Chancellor's many landholdings around Autun are included in the vista. A haze covers a mountain range in the far distance. As in many Early Netherlandish paintings, the steepness of the hills and mountains is shown as much greater than that found locally, for dramatic effect.\nThe small garden with many flowers identifiable (including lilies, irises, paeonies and roses), visible just outside the columns, symbolizes Mary's virtues. Beyond, two male figures wearing chaperons are looking through the crenellations of what looks to be a fortified balcony or bridge. There has been speculation that they may represent van Eyck and an assistant, after the pattern of his Arnolfini Portrait. The figure on the right wears a similar red chaperon to the probable van Eyck self-portrait in the National Gallery, London. Near to them are two peacocks, symbols both of immortality and of pride, to which even a powerful man as Rolin might succumb. \n\nThe interior has complex light sources, typical of van Eyck, with light coming both from the central portico and the side windows. The chancellor, whose strong character is well rendered by the artist, is wearing a fur-lined, elegant garment; the Virgin, the same size as Rolin (rather a novelty in comparison to the Gothic painting tradition), is instead covered by a red mantle. The Infant Jesus holds a cross in his left hand. The perfectionist rendering of details and textures, such as the capitals, the checquered pavement, the goldwork of the angel's crown or the garments is characteristic of Jan van Eyck's work, of which this is one of the finest examples.\n\nAs in other van Eycks, the depiction of the space is not as straightforward as it first appears. Comparison of the floor-tiles with other elements shows that the figures are only about six feet from the columned loggia screen, and that Rolin might have to squeeze himself through the opening to get out that way. Many van Eycks show an interior space that is actually very small, but the depiction is subtly managed to retain a sense of intimacy, but without feeling constricted.\n\nInfrared reflectograms have disclosed a number of changes from the underdrawing. Rolin had a large purse hanging from his belt; since he had grown very rich in public office he probably felt that would be inappropriate. The infant Christ was originally pointing at the floor. Old descriptions from Autun tell us that the painting originally had a wooden frame painted illusionistically with inscriptions seemingly carved, like van Eyck's two portraits in London (\"Léal Souvenir\" and \"Portrait of a Man in a Turban\").\n\nThe Virgin sits with the infant Christ \"on her knee\" (i.e. on her thighs), which make a platform for the infant. This very traditional motif is known as the \"Throne of Wisdom\", and was often used by Jan van Eyck, who elaborated the meaning in complex allusions. The Virgin's body was often compared to an altar, on which Christ was present as he was believed to be during the Mass. This painting may have originally hung to the left of Rolin's place at the front of his chapel in his parish church, between him and the altar. To Rolin, or a viewer of the real and painted Rolins together, the Virgin is painted in the position of the altar in the chapel. The illuminated manuscript in front of Rolin is open to a page with a large initial D, which probably indicates \"Domine, labia mea aperies\" (\"Lord, open my lips\"), the opening of Matins; this is therefore a Book of Hours. \n\nThe architecture of the loggia, as in so many of van Eyck's paintings, is in a rich and delicate Romanesque style far from the Gothic styles of his own day. The setting probably represents at the same time an imaginary building in Autun, and the \"Heavenly city of Jerusalem\"; two personages from two worlds are shown, and their surrounding combines the world of each.\n\nThe painting might be connected with the appointment in 1436 of Rolin's son Jean as Bishop of Autun; there is a magnificent cathedral on the Virgin's side of the river. Also, just above Rolin's hands there is a smaller church, perhaps intended to represent a new church dedicated to the Virgin, or his own parish church, \"Notre-Dame-du-Chastel\" which he greatly enriched.\n\nThere appears to be a series of illustrations of the Seven deadly sins distributed among the details of the painting. The reliefs just over Rolin's head show (from left) \"the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise\" (Pride), the \"Killing of Abel by Cain\" (Envy) and the \"Drunkenness of Noah\" (Gluttony). Then the lion-heads on the capitals behind Rolin may stand for Anger, and the tiny squashed rabbits between column and base in the loggia screen for Lust (which they were considered to exemplify in the Middle Ages). All these details are on Rolin's side of the painting; no equivalents are visible on the other, divine, side. However this leaves Avarice and Sloth unaccounted for, unless perhaps the human figures of Rolin himself (with his underdrawn purse), and the idlers out on the terrace (perhaps including, as stated above, van Eyck himself) represent the last two vices.\n\nNew theories about \"The Virgin and Child with Chancellor Rolin\" and Jan van Eyck's journey to Spain\n"}
{"id": "35492680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35492680", "title": "New Aesthetic", "text": "New Aesthetic\n\nThe New Aesthetic is a term, coined by James Bridle, used to refer to the increasing appearance of the visual language of digital technology and the Internet in the physical world, and the blending of virtual and physical. The phenomenon has been around for a long time but James Bridle articulated the notion through a series of talks and observations. The term gained wider attention following a panel at the SXSW conference in 2012.\n\nDeveloping from a series of collections of digital objects that have become located in the physical, the movement circulates around a blog named \"The New Aesthetic\" and which has defined the broad contours of the movement without a manifesto. The New Aesthetic as a concept was introduced at South By South West (SXSW) on March 12, 2012, at a panel organised by James Bridle and included Aaron Cope, Ben Terrett, Joanne McNeil and Russell Davies.\n\nAn article by Bruce Sterling in Wired Magazine propelled the ideas around the New Aesthetic into critical and public consciousness. Sterling's article described the concept's main outlines but also proposed some key critical areas for development. The subsequent response from across the web was rapid and engaged with a number of significant contemporaneous contributions.\n\nThe author Bruce Sterling has said of the New Aesthetic:\n\nMatthew Battles, a contributor to Metalab, a project of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, gives a definition that makes reference to purported paradigmatic examples:\n\nOne of the more substantive contributions to the notion of the New Aesthetic has been through a development of, and linking to, the way in which the digital and the everyday are increasingly interpenetrating each other. Here, the notion of the unrepresentability of computation, as both an infrastructure and an ecology, are significant in understanding the common New Aesthetic tendency towards pixelated graphics and a retro 8-bit form. This is related to the idea of an episteme (or ontotheology) identified with relation to computation and computational ways of seeing and doing: \"computationality\".\n\nMichael Betancourt has discussed the New Aesthetic in relation to digital automation. The ‘new aesthetic’ provides a reference point for the examination of Karl Marx's discussion of machines in ‘The Fragment on Machines.’\nAccording to Betancourt, the New Aesthetic documents a shift in production that is different than that described by Marx. Where the machines Marx described were dependent on human control, those identified with the New Aesthetic work to supplant the human element, replacing it with digital automation, effectively removing living labor from the production process.\n\nOne movement that draws parallels to \"New Aesthetic\" is \"Seapunk\".\n\n\n"}

Finally, a blow-up of the copy of the dictionary definition is to be hung to the right of the chair, its upper edge aligned with that of the photograph.\n\n\"Event cards\" of Fluxus-artists like George Brecht, Dick Higgins and Yoko Ono prefigured Kosuth's concern with the difference between a concept and its mode of presentation. These artists also tackled the problem of presenting \"concepts\" to an art audience. \"One and Three Chairs\" is, perhaps, a step towards a resolution of this problem. Rather than present the viewer with the bare written instructions for the work, or make a live event of the realization of the concept (in the manner of the Fluxus artists), Kosuth instead unifies concept and realization. \"One and Three Chairs\" demonstrates how an artwork can embody an idea that remains constant despite changes to its elements. \n\nKosuth stresses the difference between concept and presentation in his writings (e.g., \"Art after Philosophy\", 1969\n) and interviews (see the quotation below). He tries to intimately bind the conceptual nature of his work with the nature of art itself, thus raising his instructions for the presentation of an artwork to the level of a discourse on art. In 1963 Henry Flynt articulated these problems in the article \"Concept Art\". This was a forerunner to Kosuth's thematization of \"Concept Art\" in \"Art after Philosophy\", the text that made \"One and Three Chairs\" famous.\n\nThe work \"One and Three Chairs\" can be seen to highlight the relation between language, picture and referent. It problematizes relations between object, visual and verbal references (denotations) plus semantic fields of the term chosen for the verbal reference. The term of the dictionary includes connotations and possible denotations which are relevant in the context of the presentation of \"One and Three Chairs\". The meanings of the three elements are congruent in certain semantic fields and incongruent in other semantic fields: A semantic congruity (\"One\") and a threefold incongruity (\"One and Three\"). Ironically, \"One and Three Chairs\" can be looked upon as simple but rather complex model, of the science of signs. A viewer may ask \"what's real here?\" and answer that \"the definition is real\"; Without a definition, one would never know what an actual chair is.\n\nThere exist different interpretations of these semantic and ontological aspects. Some refer to Plato´s \"Republic\" (Book X); others refer to Ludwig Wittgenstein´s \"Tractatus\" or to Charles Sanders Peirce's triad icon-index-symbol. Dreher discusses the semantic problems of \"One and Three Chairs\" as inclusions of circles which represent semantic fields.\n\nThe work tends to defy formal analysis because one chair can be substituted for another chair, rendering the photograph and the chair photographed elusive to description. Nevertheless the particular chair and its accompanying photograph lend themselves to formal analysis. There are many chairs in the world; thus only those actually used can be described. Those chairs not used would not be analyzed. The enlarged dictionary definition of the word chair is also open to formal analysis, as is the diagram containing instructions of the work.\n\nKosuth's thematization of semantic congruities and incongruities can be seen as a reflection of the problems which the relations between concept and presentation pose. Kosuth uses the related questions, \"how meanings of signs are constituted\" and \"how signs refer to extra-lingual phenomena\" as a fundament to discuss the relation between concept and presentation. Kosuth tries to identify or equate these philosophical problems with the theory of art. Kosuth changes the art practice from hand-made originals to notations with substitutable realizations, and tries to exemplify the relevance of this change for the theory of art. \n\nIn \"Art after Philosophy,\" Kosuth provoked a confrontation with the formal criticism of Clement Greenberg and Michael Fried. Both exposed the concept of the art work as a non-substitutable instance realized by an artist who follows no other criteria than visual ones. They defined this concept as the core of modernism. In the sixties, Greenberg's and Fried's modernist doctrine dominated the American discussions on art; meanwhile, the artists Allan Kaprow, Dick Higgins, Henry Flynt, Mel Bochner, Robert Smithson and Joseph Kosuth wrote articles on art exemplifying a pluralistic anti- and post-modernist tendency which gained more influence at the end of the sixties. In 1968, Greenberg tried to disqualify the new tendencies as \"'novelty' art\": \"The different mediums are exploding...when everybody is a revolutionary the revolution is over.\" Sam Hunter offered a more positive view in 1972: \"The situation of open possibilities which confronted artists in the first years of the seventies allowed a variety of means and many fertile idea systems to coexist, reconciling through the poetic imagination apparent contradictions.\" \n\nJoseph Kosuth, WBAI, April 7, 1970:\n\n\n\n"}

One day a drug dealer named Thai (April Wade) mistakenly comes to his door. She decides to help Opie by finding him a good woman, initially (and unsuccessfully) by online personal ads. Thai and Opie end up sleeping together while high on marijuana, and then end up seeing each other regularly. Opie starts having sex with other women, including Thai's lesbian lover Dakota (Ute Werner) and a \"gun-toting\" nymphomaniac named Rain (Jesselynn Desmond).\n\n\nThe film was shot at the Higgins Building in Los Angeles, in a New York City-style loft, and is partly autobiographical. According to writer/director James Ricardo, it was [originally] called Sunnyvale because he \"\"didn't know what else to call it\", and expanding, \"Much like movie titles like Eraserhead. Sunnyvale is a comedic sounding title. It's a city that could only be in California.\"\" Under its new title it is distributed by Vivendi Entertainment.\n\nThe film was titled \"Sunnyvale\" during its film festival run and was the winner of the William Shatner Golden Groundhog Award for 'Best Underground Movie' of 2005. The award has been described by critic Joshua Taylor as \"maybe... just a veiled promotional tool for William Shatner's new DVD of the month club\".\n\nSFist wrote that \"...writer/director James Ricardo also starred in the movie and he was definitely the weakest of the actors. So it was hard to tell if it was just wooden acting that make Ricardo, the character, so passive or if he was intended to be. Talking to other filmgoers about it afterwards, we all seemed confused. No one really disliked it but everyone seemed unsure if they liked it really, or if they just wanted to like it.\"\n\nDVD Talk offered that the film is \"a lowbrow talking head comedy with a wittier than average script\", and for \"a first time director, Ricardo could have done much worse. His script is good, and he gets good performances from his three lead actresses.\" In making comparisons between Ricardo and directors such as Woody Allen and Clint Eastwood who have acted in films they were also directing, they made note that Ricardo's own lead performance as a deadpan Opie was serviceable, but had a stiffness that a director not himself in front of the camera might have caught. They summarized by stating the film \"is a quirky romantic comedy about sex that has no sex and stars a cast of unknowns. But if you can get past that, you should be entertained.\"\n\nDVD Verdict noted that the title and packaging led to expectations of a cheapo sex comedy featuring \"clichéd plot developments and plenty of gratuitous nudity\", but that the film \"feels more like a stage adaptation than anything else\", with sexual content only being alluded to by dialogue scenes serving \"as the 'before' and 'after' for dozens of brief but apparently successful sexual encounters\" They commented that the \"editing is tight, the dialogue is occasionally quite amusing, and the film rarely becomes terribly boring\", noting there were \"many individual attributes of merit here, so it's a little disappointing that the film as a whole doesn't quite gel.\" They commented that the character of Opie as written by Ricardo had lots of potential, but that as played by the director just was not interesting. They noted a paradox in that \"Ricardo's performance suggests that he knows his writing is good\", in that he \"delivers the dialogue with a sort of smug assurance that feels more like a tell than like a natural extension of the character's personality\". They concluded that the film \"wins points for breaking some genre conventions\", and that Ricardo and some of the other cast have potential for future films.\n\n"}
{"id": "241261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=241261", "title": "Orient", "text": "Orient\n\nThe Orient is a historical term for the \"East\", traditionally comprising anything that belongs to the Eastern world, in relation to Europe. In English, it is largely a metonym for, and coterminous with, the continent of Asia, loosely classified into the Near East, Middle East and Far East: the directional regions now known today as western Asia, southern Asia, eastern Asia, and southeast Asia (Note that traditionally directional regions of a continent do not use an upper-case letter). Originally, the term \"Orient\" was used to designate the Near East, and later its meaning evolved and expanded, designating also the Middle East or the Far East. \nThe term Oriental is often used to describe objects from the Orient. However, given its Eurocentric connotations and shifting, inaccurate definition through the ages, it is generally considered offensive as a label for people from Asia.\n\nThe term \"Orient\" derives from the Latin word \"oriens\" meaning \"east\" (lit. \"rising\" < \"orior\" \" rise\"). The use of the word for \"rising\" to refer to the east (where the sun rises) has analogs from many languages: compare the terms \"Levant\" (< French \"levant\" \"rising\"), \"Vostok\" (< Russian \"voskhod\" \"sunrise\"), \"Anatolia\" (< Greek \"anatole\"), \"mizrahi\" in Hebrew (\"zriha\" meaning sunrise), \"sharq\" (< Arabic ' \"rise\", ' \"rising\"), \"shygys\" (< Kazakh \"shygu\" \"come out\"), (< Turkish \"doğmak\" to be born; to rise), (, a pictograph of the sun rising behind a tree) and \"The Land of the Rising Sun\" to refer to Japan. Also, many ancient temples, including pagan temples and the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, were built with their main entrances facing the East. This tradition was carried on in Christian churches. To situate them in such a manner was to \"orient\" them in the proper direction. When something was facing the correct direction, it was said to be in the proper \"orientation\".\n\nAnother explanation of the term stems from Rome during the Roman Empire, specifically the Eastern Roman Empire, or the \"Roman Orient\", during the Byzantine Empire. Although the original East-West (or Orient-Occident) line was the Italian Peninsula's East Coast, around 600 AD this would shift to the City of Rome. Any area below the City of Rome was considered the Orient, as well as the ethnicities inhabiting the land, such as Dalmatian Italians, (modern Neapolitans along with Sicilians, Libyans, Moroccans, Greeks, etc.), as well as everything East of Southern Italy, hence the Italian name \"Italia nord-orientale\" (in English Northeast Italy) for Le Tre Venezie (the 3 Venices) located above the Roman latitude line separating it from modern Abruzzo; the beginning of the Orient in the East, while Lazio is its beginning in the West of the Italian Peninsula.\n\nThe opposite term \"Occident\" derives from the Latin word \"occidens\", meaning \"west\" (lit. \"setting\" < \"occido\" \"fall/set\"). This term meant the west (where the sun sets) but has fallen into disuse in English, in favor of \"Western world\".\n\nTerritorialization of the Roman term \"Orient\" occurred during the reign of emperor Diocletian (284-305), when the Diocese of the Orient (Latin: \"Dioecesis Orientis\") was formed. Later in the 4th century, the Praetorian prefecture of the Orient (Latin: \"Praefectura Praetorio Orientis\") was also formed, including most of the Eastern Roman Empire, from the Thrace eastwards; its easternmost part was the original \"Diocese of the Orient\", corresponding roughly to the region of Syria. \n\nOver time, the common understanding of \"the Orient\" has continually shifted eastwards, as European people traveled farther into Asia. It finally reached the Pacific Ocean, in what Westerners came to call \"the Far East\". These shifts in time and identification sometimes confuse the scope (historical and geographic) of Oriental Studies. Yet there remain contexts where \"the Orient\" and \"Oriental\" have kept their older meanings (e.g., \"Oriental spices\" typically are from the regions extending from the Middle East to sub-continental India to Indo-China). Travelers may again take the Orient Express train from Paris to its terminus in the European part of Istanbul, a route established in the early 20th century.\n\nIn European historiography, the meaning of \"the Orient\" changed in scope several times. Originally, the term referred to Egypt, the Levant, and adjoining areas. as far west as Morocco. During the 1800s, India, and to a lesser extent China, began to displace the Levant as the primary subject of Orientalist research. By the mid-20th century, Western scholars generally considered \"the Orient\" as just East Asia, Southeast Asia, and eastern Central Asia. As recently as the early 20th century, the term \"Orient\" often continued to be used in ways that included North Africa. Today, the term primarily evokes images of China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Mongolia, and peninsular Southeast Asia. Throughout the history of the changing sense of the term, \"the Orient\" was never equivalent to Asia as a whole. \"The Orient\" being largely a cultural term, large parts of Asia—Siberia most notably—were excluded from the scholarly notion of \"the Orient\".\n\nEqually valid terms for the Orient still exist in the English language in such collocations as Oriental studies (now Asian Studies in some countries).\n\nThe adjectival term Oriental has been used by the West to mean cultures, peoples, countries, Asian rugs, and goods from the Orient. \"Oriental\" means generally \"eastern\". It is a traditional designation (especially when capitalized) for anything belonging to the Orient or \"East\" (for Asia), and especially of its Eastern culture. It indicated the eastern direction in historical astronomy, often abbreviated \"Ori\". In contemporary American English, \"Oriental\" usually refers to things from the parts of East Asia traditionally occupied by East Asians and most Central Asians and Southeast Asians racially categorized as \"Mongoloid\". This excludes Jews, Indians, Arabs, and most other South or West Asian peoples. Because of historical discrimination against Chinese, Korean and Japanese, in some parts of the United States, some people consider the term derogatory. For example, Washington state prohibits the word \"Oriental\" in legislation and government documents, preferring the word \"Asian\" instead.\n\nIn more local uses, \"oriental\" is also used for eastern parts of countries, for example Morocco's Oriental Region. Oriental is also used as an adjective akin to \"eastern\", especially in the Spanish-speaking world. For example, the Philippine islands of Mindoro and Negros are each divided into two provinces whose titles include the words \"oriental\" and \"occidental\" respectively. The official name of Uruguay is the República Oriental del Uruguay or Oriental Republic of Uruguay because it is east of the Uruguay River.\n\nSince the 19th century, \"orientalist\" has been the traditional term for a scholar of Oriental studies; however, the use in English of \"Orientalism\" to describe academic \"Oriental studies\" is rare: the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" cites only one such usage, by Lord Byron in 1812. Orientalism is more widely used to refer to the works of the many 19th-century artists who specialized in \"Oriental\" subjects, often drawing on their travels to North Africa and Western Asia. Artists as well as scholars were already described as \"Orientalists\" in the 19th century. In 1978, Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said published his influential and controversial book, \"Orientalism\"; he used the term to describe a pervasive Western tradition, both academic and artistic, of prejudiced outsider interpretations of the Arab and Muslim worlds, shaped by the attitudes of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nIn British English, the term \"Oriental\" is sometimes used to refer to people from East and Southeast Asia (such as those from China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mongolia and Laos). \"Asian\" in Great Britain and Ireland generally refers to people that come from South Asia (in particular Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Maldives) since British Asians make up approximately 6.9% of the population within the United Kingdom. \"Orientals\" refers exclusively to people of East and Southeast Asian origin, who comprise 0.7% of the UK population as a whole, and 5.3% of the non-European population. Of these, the majority are of Chinese descent. \"Orient\" is also a word for the lustre of a fine pearl. Hong Kong, a former British colony, has been called \"Pearl of the Orient\".\n\nDistinct within American culture, some American English speakers consider the term \"Oriental\" to be a pejorative and disparaging term when used to describe a person. John Kuo Wei Tchen, director of the Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program and Institute at New York University, said the basic critique of the term developed in the U.S. in the 1970s. Tchen has said: \"With the U.S.A. anti-war movement in the '60s and early '70s, many Asian Americans identified the term 'Oriental' with a Western process of racializing Asians as forever opposite 'others'.\" In a 2009 American press release related to legislation aimed at removing the term \"oriental\" from official documents of the State of New York, Governor David Paterson said: \"The word 'oriental' does not describe ethnic origin, background or even race; in fact, it has deep and demeaning historical roots\".\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama signed legislation striking the word from federal law.\n\nIn Australian English, the term \"Asian\" generally refers to people of East Asian or Southeast Asian descent, such as those of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, or Filipino descent. Persons of Pakistani, Sri Lankan, and most other South Asian descent are referred to by their respective demonym, but without explicit knowledge, those people are indeterminately inferred as \"Indian\".\n\nIn German, \"Orient\" is usually used synonymously with the area between the Near East and India, including Israel, the Arab world, and Greater Persia.\n\nThe term \"Asiaten\" (English: Asians) means the people of East Asia and Southeast Asia. Another word for Orient in German is \"Morgenland\" (now mainly poetic), which literally translates as \"morning land\". The antonym \"Abendland\" (rarely: \"Okzident\") is also mainly poetic, and refers to (Western) Europe.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2361047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2361047", "title": "Page layout", "text": "Page layout\n\nPage layout is the part of graphic design that deals in the arrangement of visual elements on a page. It generally involves organizational principles of composition to achieve specific communication objectives.\n\nThe high-level page layout involves deciding on the overall arrangement of text and images, and possibly on the size or shape of the medium. It requires intelligence, sentience, and creativity, and is informed by culture, psychology, and what the document authors and editors wish to communicate and emphasize. Low-level pagination and typesetting are more mechanical processes. Given certain parameters - boundaries of text areas, the typeface, font size, and justification preference can be done in a straightforward way. Until desktop publishing became dominant, these processes were still done by people, but in modern publishing they are almost always automated. The result might be published as-is (as for a residential phone book interior) or might be tweaked by a graphic designer (as for a highly polished, expensive publication) it is very important as it allows you to read a Magazine.\n\nBeginning from early illuminated pages in hand-copied books of the Middle Ages and proceeding down to intricate modern magazine and catalog layouts, proper page design has long been a consideration in printed material. With print media, elements usually consist of type (text), images (pictures), and occasionally place-holder graphics for elements that are not printed with ink such as die/laser cutting, foil stamping or blind embossing.\n\nWith manuscripts, all of the elements are added by hand, so the creator can determine the layout directly as they create the work, perhaps with an advance sketch as a guide.\n\nWith ancient woodblock printing, all elements of the page were carved directly into wood, though later layout decisions might need to be made if the printing was transferred onto a larger work, such as a large piece of fabric, potentially with multiple block impressions.\n\nWith the Renaissance invention of letterpress printing and cold-metal moveable type, typesetting was accomplished by physically assembling characters using a composing stick into a galley—a long tray. Any images would be created by engraving.\n\nThe original document would be a hand-written manuscript; if the typesetting was performed by someone other than the layout artist, markup would be added to the manuscript with instructions as to typeface, font size, and so on. (Even after authors began to use typewriters in the 1860s, originals were still called \"manuscripts\" and the markup process was the same.)\n\nAfter the first round of typesetting, a galley proof might be printed in order for proofreading to be performed, either to correct errors in the original, or to make sure that the typesetter had copied the manuscript properly, and correctly interpreted the markup. The final layout would be constructed in a \"form\" or \"forme\" using pieces of wood or metal (\"furniture\") to space out the text and images as desired, a frame known as a chase, and objects which lock down the frame known as quoins. This process is called imposition, and potentially includes arranging multiple pages to be printed on the same sheet of paper which will later be folded and possibly trimmed. An \"imposition proof\" (essentially a short run of the press) might be created to check the final placement.\n\nThe invention of hot metal typesetting in 1884 sped up the typesetting process by allowing workers to produce slugs—entire lines of text—using a keyboard. The slugs were the result of molten metal being poured into molds temporarily assembled by the typesetting machine. The layout process remained the same as with cold metal type, however: assembly into physical galleys.\n\nOffset lithography allows the bright and dark areas of an image (at first captured on film) to control ink placement on the printing press. This means that if a single copy of the page can be created on paper and photographed, then any number of copies could be printed. Type could be set with a typewriter, or to achieve professional results comparable to letterpress, a specialized typesetting machine. The IBM Selectric Composer, for example, could produce type of different size, different fonts (including proportional fonts), and with text justification. With photoengraving and halftone, physical photographs could be transferred into print directly, rather than relying on hand-made engravings.\n\nThe layout process then became the task of creating the paste up, so named because rubber cement or other adhesive would be used to physically paste images and columns of text onto a rigid sheet of paper. Completed pages become known as camera-ready, \"mechanical\" or \"mechanical art\".\n\nPhototypesetting was invented in 1945; after keyboard input, characters were shot one-by-one onto a photographic negative, which could then be sent to the print shop directly, or shot onto photographic paper for paste-up. These machines became increasingly sophisticated, with computer-driven models able to store text on magnetic tape.\n\nAs the graphics capabilities of computers matured, they began to be used to render characters, columns, pages, and even multi-page signatures directly, rather than simply summoning a photographic template from a pre-supplied set. In addition to being used as display devices for computer operators, cathode ray tubes were used to render text for phototypesetting. The curved nature of the CRT display however, led to distortions of text and art on the screen towards the outer edges of the screens. The advent of \"flat screen\" monitors (LCD, LED, and more recently OLED) in early 2010 eliminated the distortion problems caused by older CRT displays. As of 2016 flat panel displays have almost completely replaced CRT displays.\n\nPrinters attached directly to computers allowed them to print documents directly, in multiple copies or as an original which could be copied on a ditto machine or photocopier. WYSIWYG word processors made it possible for general office users and consumers to make more sophisticated page layouts, use text justification, and use more fonts than were possible with typewriters. Early dot matrix printing was sufficient for office documents, but was of too low a quality for professional typesetting. Inkjet printing and laser printing did produce sufficient quality type, and so computers with these types of printers quickly replaced phototypesetting machines.\n\nWith modern desktop publishing software such as flagship software Adobe Indesign and cloud-based Lucidpress, the layout process can occur entirely on-screen. (Similar layout options that would be available to a professional print shop making a paste-up are supported by desktop publishing software; in contrast, \"word processing\" software usually has a much more limited set of layout and typography choices available, trading off flexibility for ease of use for more common applications.) A finished document can be directly printed as the camera-ready version, with no physical assembly required (given a big enough printer). Greyscale images must be either half toned digitally if being sent to an offset press, or sent separately for the print shop to insert into marked areas. Completed works can also be transmitted digitally to the print shop, who may print it themselves, shoot it directly to film, or use computer to plate technology to skip the physical original entirely. PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF) have become standard file formats for digital transmission.\n\nSince the advent of personal computing, page layout skills have expanded to electronic media as well as print media. E-books, PDF documents, and static web pages mirror paper documents relatively closely, but computers can also add multimedia animation, and interactivity. Page layout for interactive media overlaps with interface design and user experience design; an interactive \"page\" is better known as a graphical user interface (GUI).\n\nModern web pages are typically produced using HTML for content and general structure, cascading style sheets to control presentation details such as typography and spacing, and JavaScript for interactivity. Since these languages are all text-based, this work can be done in a text editor, or a special HTML editor which may have WYSIWYG features or other aids. Additional technologies such as Macromedia Flash may be used for multimedia content. Web developers are responsible for actually creating a finished document using these technologies, but a separate web designer may be responsible for establishing the layout. A given web designer might be a fluent web developer as well, or may merely be familiar with the general capabilities of the technologies and merely visualize the desired result for the development team.\n\nProjected slides used in presentations or entertainment often have similar layout considerations to printed pages.\n\nThe magic lantern and opaque projector were used during lectures in the 1800s, using printed, typed, photographed, or hand-drawn originals. Two sets of photographic film (one negative and one positive) or one reversal film can be used to create positive images that can be projected with light passing through. Intertitles were used extensively in the earliest motion pictures when sound was not available; they are still used occasionally in addition to the ubiquitous vanity cards and credits.\n\nIt became popular to use transparent film for presentations (with opaque text and images) using overhead projectors in the 1940s, and slide projectors in the 1950s. Transparencies for overhead projectors could be printed by some photocopiers. Computer presentation programs became available in the 1980s, making it possible to lay out a presentation digitally. Computer-developed presentations could be printed to a transparency with some laser printers, transferred to slides, or projected directly using LCD overhead projectors. Modern presentations are often displayed digitally using a video projector, computer monitor, or large-screen television.\n\nLaying out a presentation presents slightly different challenges than a print document, especially because a person will typically be speaking and referring to the projected pages. Consideration might be given to:\n\nGrids and templates are page layout design patterns used in advertising campaigns and multiple-page publications, including websites.\n\nA grid is a set of guidelines, able to be seen in the design process and invisible to the end-user/audience, for aligning and repeating elements on a page. A page layout may or may not stay within those guidelines, depending on how much repetition or variety the design style in the series calls for. Grids are meant to be flexible. Using a grid to lay out elements on the page may require just as much or more graphic design skill than that which was required to design the grid.\n\nIn contrast, a template is more rigid. A template involves repeated elements mostly visible to the end-user/audience. Using a template to lay out elements usually involves less graphic design skill than that which was required to design the template. Templates are used for minimal modification of background elements and frequent modification (or swapping) of foreground content.\n\nMost desktop publishing software allows for grids in the form of a page filled with coloured lines or dots placed at a specified equal horizontal and vertical distance apart. Automatic margins and booklet spine (gutter) lines may be specified for global use throughout the document. Multiple additional horizontal and vertical lines may be placed at any point on the page. Invisible to the end-user/audience shapes may be placed on the page as guidelines for page layout and print processing as well. Software templates are achieved by duplicating a template data file, or with master page features in a multiple-page document. Master pages may include both grid elements and template elements such as header and footer elements, automatic page numbering, and automatic table of contents features.\n\nStatic layouts allow for more control over the aesthetics, and thorough optimization of space around and overlapping irregular-shaped content than dynamic layouts. In web design, this is sometimes referred to as a fixed width layout; but the entire layout may be scalable in size while still maintaining the original proportions, static placement, and style of the content. All raster image formats are static layouts in effect; but a static layout may include searchable text by separating the text from the graphics.\n\nIn contrast, electronic pages allow for dynamic layouts with swapping content, personalization of styles, text scaling, image scaling, or reflowable content with variable page sizes often referred to as fluid or liquid layout. Dynamic layouts are more likely to separate presentation from content, which comes with its own advantages. A dynamic layout lays out all text and images into rectangular areas of rows and columns. As these areas' widths and heights are defined to be percentages of the available screen, they are responsive to varying screen dimensions. They'll automatically ensure maximized use of available space while always staying adapted optimally both on screen resizes and hardware-given restrictions. Text may freely be resized to provide users' individual needs on legibility while never disturbing a given layout's proportions. The content's overall arrangement on screen this way may always remain as it was originally designed.\n\nStatic layout design may involve more graphic design and visual art skills, whereas dynamic layout design may involve more interactive design and content management skills to thoroughly anticipate content variation.\n\nMotion graphics don't fit neatly into either category, but may involve layout skills or careful consideration of how the motion may affect the layout. In either case, the element of motion makes it a dynamic layout, but one that warrants motion graphic design more than static graphic design or interactive design.\n\nElectronic pages may utilize both static and dynamic layout features by dividing the pages or by combining the effects. For example, a section of the page such as a web banner may contain static or motion graphics contained within a swapping content area. Dynamic or live text may be wrapped around irregular shaped images by using invisible spacers to push the text away from the edges. Some computer algorithms can detect the edges of an object that contain transparency and flow content around contours.\n\nWith modern media content retrieval and output technology, there is much overlap between visual communications (front-end) and information technology (back-end). Large print publications (thick books, especially instructional in nature) and electronic pages (web pages) require meta data for automatic indexing, automatic reformatting, database publishing, dynamic page display and end-user interactivity. Much of the meta data (meta tags) must be hand coded or specified during the page layout process. This divides the task of page layout between artists and engineers, or tasks the artist/engineer to do both.\n\nMore complex projects may require two separate designs: page layout design as the front-end, and function coding as the back-end. In this case, the front-end may be designed using an alternative page layout technology such as image editing software or on paper with hand rendering methods. Most image editing software includes features for converting a page layout for use in a \"What You See Is What You Get\" (WYSIWYG) editor or features to export graphics for desktop publishing software. WYSIWYG editors and desktop publishing software allow front-end design prior to back-end coding in most cases. Interface design and database publishing may involve more technical knowledge or collaboration with information technology engineering in the front-end. Sometimes, a function on the back-end is to automate the retrieval and arrangement of content on the front-end.\n\nPage layout might be prescribed to a greater or lesser degree by a house style which might be implemented in a specific desktop publishing template. There might also be relatively little layout to do in comparison to the amount of pagination (as in novels and other books with no figures).\n\nTypical page layout decisions include:\n\nSpecific elements to be laid out might include:\n\nIn newspaper production, final selection and cropping of photographs accompanying stories might be left to the layout editor (since the choice of photo could affect the shape of the area needed, and thus the rest of the layout), or there might be a separate photo editor. Likewise, headlines might be written by the layout editor, a copy editor, or the original author.\n\nTo make stories fit the final layout, relatively inconsequential copy tweaks might be made (for example, rephrasing for brevity), or the layout editor might make slight adjustments to typography elements like font size or leading.\n\nA floating block in writing and publishing is any graphic, text, table, or other representation that is unaligned from the main flow of text. Use of floating blocks to present pictures and tables is a typical feature of academic writing and technical writing, including scientific articles and books. Floating blocks are normally labeled with a caption or title that describes its contents and a number that is used to refer to the figure from the main text. A common system divides floating block into two separately numbered series, labeled \"figure\" (for pictures, diagrams, plots, etc.) and \"table\". An alternative name for figure is image or graphic.\n\nFloating blocks are said to be \"floating\" because they are not fixed in position on the page at the place, but rather drift to the side of the page. By placing pictures or other large items on the sides of pages rather than embedding them in the middle of the main flow of text, typesetting is more flexible and interruption to the flow of the narrative is avoided.\n\nFor example, an article on geography might have \"Figure 1: Map of the world\", \"Figure 2: Map of Europe\", \"Table 1: Population of continents\", \"Table 2: Population of European countries\", and so on. Some books will have a table of figures—in addition to the table of contents—that lists centrally all the figures appearing in the work.\n\nOther kinds of floating blocks may be differentiated as well, for example:\n\nA mockup of a layout might be created to get early feedback, usually before all the content is actually ready. Whether for paper or electronic media, the first draft of a layout might be simply a rough paper and pencil sketch. A comprehensive layout for a new magazine might show placeholders for text and images, but demonstrate placement, typographic style, and other idioms intended to set the pattern for actual issues, or a particular unfinished issue. A website wireframe is a low-cost way to show layout without doing all the work of creating the final HTML and CSS, and without writing the copy or creating any images.\n\nLorem ipsum text is often used to avoid the embarrassment any improvised sample copy might cause if accidentally published. Likewise, placeholder images are often labelled \"for position only\".\n\n"}

Already before the end of the 1970s Samuel Beckett was produced in Poland by over a dozen national theatres in seven metropolitan cities including primary TV broadcast in 1971. His \"En attendant Godot\" in translation premiered as far back as 1957 both in Warsaw (at \"Teatr Współczesny\") and in Kraków (\"Teatr 38\"). Polish postmodernism can be identified in the work of prolific poet and playwright Tadeusz Różewicz, philosophers Leszek Kołakowski, Stanisław Lem, Tadeusz Kantor, or in the output of various Polish émigré writers such as the Nobel laureate Czesław Miłosz (\"The Captive Mind\") and his contemporaries including Witold Gombrowicz. The basis for the distinctiveness of Polish postmodernism were established avant la lettre already in the Interbellum through controversial, though widely recognized works of Witkacy (the \"Golden Laurel\" of PAL, 1935), and Karol Irzykowski among others.\n\nIn the Polish context, postmodernism has been categorized by literary critics as the framework of pluralism necessary for the success of European integration as far as post-national diversity and regional differences are concerned.\n\nThe official welcome of postmodernism in post-communist Poland was somewhat late; it met with severe impediments not so much from the former communist establishment as from Solidarity itself and the Catholic Church, both of which promoted \"collectivist\" rather than \"liberal\" values. However, beginning in the 1990s and throughout the early 21st century, postmodernism began to take a firm hold especially in the realms of poetics and art theory. Polish architects (Czesław Bielecki, TVP; Marek Budzyński) and selected filmmakers (i.e. Kieślowski, Machulski, Agnieszka Holland, : the \"Suicide Room\") contribute substantially to the Polish postmodernist in popular culture.\n\nAlthough postmodernism was widely promoted in the so-called \"Drugi obieg\" (the Second circulation) by Polish underground press, it has also been criticized as amorphous by both, Catholic philosophers, as well as \"fallen Marxists\", credited with the emergence of in Poland – based on \"extreme relativism\" and bitter sense of humor (see Mrożek). The continuous dialog extending well-beyond the Martial law in Poland, eventually led to destruction of the totalitarian ideology, and the inevitable acceptance of \"pluralism\" over \"foundationalism\" in art theory.\n\nPostmodernism entered Poland in the 1960s at the end of the Stalinist period (with Wróblewski having the greatest impact on postwar figurative painting). It was coupled with the advent of conceptualism, Pop art, as well as . These new movements – beginning as unofficial political and artistic discourses – challenged the vast matrix of Polish institutionalized culture defined before 1989 by the one-party system and the use of politically charged realism as method of social control.\n\n"}

May is coolly scrutinizing the viewer, her other hand on her hip, with her trousers unbuttoned such that her pubic hair is visible. McCall's intention in painting May was to explore \"how women choose to express their sexual identity beyond the male gaze\".\n\nThe painting received public attention after the Mall Galleries removed it from the Society of Women Artists's annual exhibition in 2014, after which it was replaced with another nude portrait. According to a statement by the Galleries, this was done because of \"a number of complaints regarding the depiction of the subject and taking account of its location en route for children to our learning centre\", and, according to McCall, because the painting had been deemed \"disgusting\" and \"pornographic\". Writing in \"The Guardian\", Rowan Pelling interpreted this reaction as implying that \"the minute a woman is alive and free to move, an active agent of her own sexuality, she is a menace to society\", whereas Mall Galleries viewers appeared to feel more comfortable with a nude woman who is a \"more passive and unthreatening recipient of the wandering viewer's gaze\".

He is best known for being one of the six flag-raisers who helped raise the second U.S. flag atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945 as shown in the iconic photograph \"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\".\n\nThe Marine Corps War Memorial located in Arlington, Virginia, which was modeled after the flag-raising photograph, depicts bronze statues of each of the six Marine flag-raisers.\n\nGagnon was born March 7, 1925 in Manchester, New Hampshire, the only child of French Canadian immigrants from Disraeli, Quebec, Henri Gagnon and Irène Marcotte. He grew up without a father. His parents separated when he was an infant, though they never divorced. When he was old enough, he worked alongside his mother at a local shoe factory. He also worked as a bicycle messenger boy for the local Western Union.\n\nGagnon was drafted in 1943, and elected to join the United States Marine Corps Reserve on May 6. He was sent to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina. On July 16, he was promoted to private first class. He was transferred to the Marine Guard Company at Charleston Navy Yard in South Carolina and remained there for eight months. He then joined the Military Police Company of the 5th Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California. On April 8, 1944, he was transferred to the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division. In September, the 5th division left Camp Pendleton for further training at Camp Tarawa, Hawaii, for the assault on Iwo Jima by three Marine divisions of the V Amphibious Corps (code named \"Operation Detachment\").\n\nOn February 19, 1945, Gagnon landed on the southeast side of Iwo Jima with E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines on \"Green Beach 1\", which was the closest landing beach to Mount Suribachi on the southern end of the island. On February 23, Gagnon, a battalion runner (messenger) for Easy Company, participated in what was most likely the most celebrated American flag raising in U.S. history.\n\nOn the morning of February 23, a 40-man combat patrol (mostly from Third Platoon, Easy Company) was sent to climb up Mount Suribach and siege and occupy the crest. First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, E Company's executive officer, who volunteered to lead the patrol, was to raise an American flag on top to signal that the mountaintop was captured. Once Schrier and his men were on top they attached the flag to a Japanese iron water pipe. Then Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sgt. Ernest Thomas, and Sgt. Henry Hansen raised the flag, planting the flagstaff into the ground. Seeing the raising of the national colors immediately caused loud cheers from the Marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen on the south end beaches of Iwo Jima and from the men on the ships near the beach.\nSome two hours after the first flag was raised on Mount Suribachi, the Marines decided that a larger flag should be flown on Mount Suribachi in order for the American flag to be seen more easily from the ships, beaches, and land off and around the north side of Mount Suribachi where most of the Japanese soldiers were located and heavy fighting would occur in the days ahead. Sgt. Michael Strank a squad leader of Second Platoon, E Company, was ordered to take three Marines from his squad up Mount Suribachi to raise the replacement flag. He selected Cpl. Harlon Block, Pfc. Ira Hayes, and Pfc. Franklin Sousley. Gagnon, a Second Battalion, 28th Marines runner (messenger) for E Company, was ordered to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return with the first flag that was flying on top.\n\nOnce Gagnon and the four Marines were on top, a Japanese pipe was found by Hayes and Sousley and taken near the first flag position, After the replacement flag was attached to it, Lt. Schrier ordered the replacement flag to be raised and the first flag lowered at the same time. Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Pfc. Gagnon, and Pfc. Harold Schultz raised the replacement flag (Navy corpsman John Bradley was incorrectly identified as a flag-raisers until June 23, 2016). In order to keep the flagstaff in a vertical position, rocks were added around the base and a rope was tied to it and staked down in three spots. Associated Press combat photographer Joe Rosenthal took a black and white photograph of this flag raising which became world-famous. The flag raising was also filmed in color by Sgt. Bill Genaust who was killed in action a few days later.\nOn March 14, 1945, a third American flag was officially raised by two Marines at Kitano Point at the northern end of the island. The flag that Gagnon helped raise in the two unofficial flag-raisings on February 23, was lowered and taken to Marine headquarters. On March 27, Gagnon and the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines left Iwo Jima and both flags that were flown on Mount Suribachi were taken to Marine Headquarters in Washington, D.C. after the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines returned to Hawaii.\n\nIn 1991, former Marine Lt. George Greeley Wells, who was the 2nd battalion, 28th Marines, adjutant in charge of carrying the American flag(s) for the battalion, stated in \"The New York Times\" that he was ordered by the battalion commander on February 23, 1945 to get a large replacement flag for the top of Mount Suribachi, and that he (Wells) ordered Gagnon, his E Company runner, to get a flag from a ship on shore — possibly the . Wells stated that this flag was the one taken up Mount Suribachi by Gagnon to be given to Lt. Schrier of Company E, with a message for Schrier to raise this flag and return the other smaller flag raised earlier on Mount Suribachi back to Gagnon. Wells also stated, that he had handed the first flag to Schrier that Schrier took up Mount Suribachi, and when this flag was returned to him by Gagnon, he secured the flag until it was delivered to Marine Headquarters after the 2nd battalion returned to Hawaii from Iwo Jima.\n\nOn March 27, 1945, when Gagnon and the 28th Marines left Iwo Jima for Hawaii, Gagnon was aboard the transport , On March 30, President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the six flag raisers in Rosenthal's flag raising photo to be sent to Washington, D.C.. Gagnon was the first to be identified, and as one of the three surviving flag raisers in the photo on April 7, followed by PhM2c. Bradley and Pfc. Hayes (Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, and Pfc. Franklin Soulsey were killed in action; Block was mistaken to be Sgt. Henry Hansen until a Marine investigation in 1946 revealed in 1947 it was Block). Once in Washington, D.C., the three were assigned to temporary duty with the Finance Division, United States Department of the Treasury, for appearances and participation in connection with the Seventh War Loan drive (bond selling tour) from May 11 through July 4 (Hayes left the bond tour on May 25 for E Company in Hawaii). The tour was kicked off with a flag raising at the Nation's capitol on May 9 and went through 33 U.S cities raising billions of desperately needed dollars to help boost morale and win the war. The three flag-raisers had the flag they had raised on Mount Suribachi with them during the bond tour.\n\nIn July 1945, Gagnon was ordered to San Diego for further transfer overseas. He married Pauline Georgette Harnois, of Hooksett, New Hampshire, in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 7, 1945.\nBy September, he was on his way overseas again, this time with the 80th Replacement Draft. On November 7, 1945, he arrived at Tsingtao, China, where he joined E Company, 2nd Battalion, 29th Marines, 6th Marine Division. He later served with the 3rd Battalion, 29th Marines. In March 1946, he had been on duty with the U.S. occupation forces in China for about five months before he boarded a ship at Tsingtao at the end of the month for San Diego. Gagnon arrived in San Diego on April 20, 1946. He was promoted to Corporal and was honorably discharged at Camp Pendleton, California, on April 27, 1946.\n\nThe Marine Corps War Memorial (also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial) in Arlington, Virginia which was inspired by Rosenthal's photograph of the second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi was dedicated on November 10, 1954. Gagnon is depicted as the second bronze statue from the bottom of the flagstaff with the 32 foot (9.8 M) bronze statues of the other five flag-raisers on the monument (as of June 23, 2016, Franklin Sousley and Harold Schultz are depicted as the third and fifth bronze statues from the bottom of the flagstaff).\n\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower sat upfront with Vice President Richard Nixon, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Anderson, and General Lemuel C. Shepherd, the 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps, during the dedication ceremony. Two of the three surviving flag-raisers depicted on the monument, Ira Hayes and Gagnon, were seated together with John Bradley (he was incorrectly identified as a surviving flag-raiser) in the front rows of seats along with relatives of those who were killed in action on the island. Speeches were given by Richard Nixon, Robert Anderson who dedicated the memorial, and General Shepherd who presented the memorial to the American people. Inscribed on the memorial are the following words:\n\nOn February 19, 1965, while working as an airline sales representative for Delta Air Lines, Gagnon visited Mount Suribachi after visiting Tokyo with his wife and son.\n\nRené Gagnon, Jr. commented in 2014 that his father René Gagnon, Sr. opened a travel agency and did accounting work and was not a bitter alcoholic, and in his last job, he had worked as head of maintenance at an apartment complex in Manchester where he suffered a heart attack in the boiler room. According to the book \"Flags of Our Fathers\" (2000), in his latter years Gagnon only participated in events that were at his wife's urging, events praising the U.S. flag raising on Iwo Jima. She enjoyed the limelight, whereas he, by that time, no longer did. \nGagnon appeared in two films about the battle of Iwo Jima: \"To the Shores of Iwo Jima\" (a government documentary which simply showed the color footage of the U.S. flag raising) and \"Sands of Iwo Jima\" (1949). He was also part of a Rose Bowl half-time show.\n\nGagnon died on October 12, 1979, at age 54, in Manchester, New Hampshire. He resided in nearby Hooksett, and was survived by wife Pauline Gagnon and son René Gagnon, Jr. at Mount Calvary Cemetery in Manchester. At the request of his widow, a government waiver was granted on April 16, 1981, and his remains were re-interred in Section 51, Grave 543 of Arlington National Cemetery on July 7. Inscribed on the back of his Arlington headstone are the words:\n\nGagnon's military awards include:\n\n\nThe Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal required 4 years service during World War II.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26681879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26681879", "title": "Royal Palace of Mari", "text": "Royal Palace of Mari\n\nThe Royal Palace of Mari was the royal residence of the rulers of the ancient kingdom of Mari in eastern Syria. Situated centrally amidst Palestine, Syria, Babylon, Levant, and other Mesopotamian city-states, Mari acted as the “middle-man” to these larger, powerful kingdoms. Both the size and grand nature of the palace demonstrate the importance of Mari during its long history, though the most intriguing feature of the palace is the nearly 25,000 tablets found within the palace rooms. The royal palace was discovered in 1935, excavated with the rest of the city throughout the 1930s, and is considered one of the most important finds made at Mari André Parrot led the excavations and was responsible for the discovery of the city and the palace. Thousands of clay tablets were discovered through the efforts of André Bianquis, which provided archaeologists the tools to learn about, and to understand, everyday life at the palace and in Mari. The discovery of the tablets also aided in the labeling of various rooms in terms of their purpose and function.\n\nThe palace reached its grandest state with its last renovation under king Zimri-Lim in the 18th century BC; in addition to serving as the home of the royal family, the palace would have also housed royal guards, state workers, members of the military, and those responsible for the daily activities of the kingdom. The apartments of the king were well separated from the rest of the palace and relatively simple to identify when Parrot led the excavations. While most rooms in the palace were interconnected and allowed access to one another, the private quarters of the royal family were very isolated. Parrot emphasized the amount of privacy afforded the king and his family, as well as the maximum level of security that was maintained through the architecture of the building.\n\nAn entry gate was the only access point of the large palace complex, thus providing added security. The layout of the palace was also built with the security of the royal family in mind. A central court was surrounded by a series of smaller rooms. Entryways to courtyards were positioned in such a way as to make any attacks on those within the courtyard nearly impossible. Such architectural features did not allow any visitor to peer directly into one of the open courts, but forced a visitor to change direction and enter on the side of the court; anyone wishing to use a weapon would not have been able to directly access any room inside of the main gateway.\n\nThe royal palace at Mari was decorated with frescoes and statues. Decoration different depending on the function of the room. Religious and royal scenes were placed in public areas, where the message of kingship and religion could easily be viewed by visitors and residents of the palace. More private rooms, like the royal apartments, were decorated with patterns, shapes, and geometric designs. Designs in the royal apartments would have added to the luxurious accommodations befitting the royal family, while the representational frescoes would have demonstrated luxury, power, and authority.\n\nStatues of gods and past rulers were the most common among statues unearthed at the Palace of Zimri-Lin. The title of Shakkanakku (military governor) was borne by all the princes of a dynasty who reigned at Mari in the late third millennium and early second millennium BC. These kings were the descendents of the military governors appointed by the kings of Akkad. Statues and sculpture were used to decorate the exterior and interior of the palace. Zimri-Lin used these statues to connect his kingship to the gods and to the traditions of past rulers. Most notable of these statues are the statue of Iddi-Ilum, Ishtup-Ilum, the Statue of the Water Goddess, and Puzur-Ishtar.\n\nThe statue of Puzur-Ishtar once stood in one of the sanctuaries of the Palace of Zimri-Lim, but was discovered in the museum of Nebuchadrezzar’s palace at Babylon (604-562 B.C.E). The inscription on the hem of the statue’s skirt mentions Puzur-Ishtar, sakkanakku of Mari, and also mentions his brother the priest Milaga. Horned caps are usually limited to divine representations in Mesopotamian art but they do not occur on depictions of kings during the Ur III period, therefore it is considered that perhaps the horns of divinity on Puzur-Ishtar’s cap qualified him (to the Babylonian soldiers) as a god to be carted home as the ultimate symbol of their victory over the people of Mari.\n\nThe Statue of Ishtup-Ilum is made of basalt and was found in room 65 of the palace. The inscription on his shoulder identifies this man as a governor (sakkanakku) of Mari during the early second millennium B.C.E. Ishtup-Ilum was known for his lavish gifts to the Ishtar temple, the temple of the popular goddess of fertility, love, war, and sex. The height of the statue is 1.52 meters. The statue is now in the Aleppo Museum.\n\nIddi-Ilum was a former sakkanakku of Mari. This statue portrays Iddi-Ilum as a religious ruler, for his hands are clasped in front of him in the typical Mesopotamian pose of prayer. His luxurious robe has a tasseled border and is wound around his body, contrary to Mesopotamian tradition. The statuette bears an inscription in Akkadian: “Iddi-Ilum, shakkanakku of Mari, has dedicated his statue to Inanna. Whosoever erases this inscription will have his line wiped out by Inanna.” Connections can be made between this statuette and the statue of Puzur-Ishtar, also shakkanakku of Mari, by virtue of the trimmed beard and rich garments.\n\nDepictions of water bearing goddesses were a common occurrence in Mesopotamia. The statue of a Goddess holding a vase was in fact a fountain, with water flowing out of the vase. This statue is nearly life size and most likely stood in the palace chapel. A channel connected to a water supply was drilled through the body of the statue and allowed water to flow from the goddess’ vase.\n\nMore than 20,000 tablets have been found in the palace. The tablets, according to André Parrot, \"brought about a complete revision of the historical dating of the ancient Near East and provided more than 500 new place names, enough to redraw or even draw up the geographical map of the ancient world\"\n\nMany of the recovered tablets have been identified as either the remains of the royal epistolary archive of Mari, other administrative documents, and the Kings letters to his wives which were found in the women's quarters. Some letters include direct quotes from King Hammurabi leading us to believe that they were contemporaneous with his rule.\n\nOther letters shed light on divinity at Mari and in the ancient Near East. Letters from the epistolary archive include fascinating information about divination, gods, and even descriptions of ancient dreams. According to the tablets, a prophetic dream was had, a letter would be sent to a diviner who would perform extispicy to confirm the revelation.\n\nFigural frescoes were found in five rooms within the Palace of Mari. From those recovered, only four compositions were able to be restored, due to the deterioration of the materials and damage done by Hammurabi of Babylon's sacking of Mari circa 2760 BCE. the date here is a misprint for ca. 1760 bce. (middle chronology) \n\n\"The Investiture of Zimri-Lim,\" dating to the 18th century BCE and discovered during 1935–1936 excavations at Mari by French archaeologist André Parrot, was the only painting found in situ in the palace. The painting is distinguished in part by its wide range of color, including green and blue. Painted on a thin layer of mud plaster applied directly to the palace's brick wall, the scene features a warrior goddess, likely Ishtar, giving Zimri-Lim a ring and a staff, the symbols of kingship. The continuation of the red and blue painted border of the panel suggests that it was one of several adorning the walls of the room.\n\nRecent restoration efforts by the Louvre have revealed previously unseen details, such as scalloping on Zimri-Lim's robe, and unexpectedly vibrant colors, such as a brilliantly orange bull.\n\nFragments of a sacrificial procession scene were found at the base of the eastern half of the same wall on which \"The Investiture of Zimri-Lim\" was recovered. The painting has multiple registers and depicts a life-size figure leading men who are in turn leading a procession of sacrificial animals. The colors utilized are black, brown, red, white, and gray.\n\nThe application technique of this scene differs from the thin mud plaster used as a base for other frescoes in the palace. The sacrificial procession scene utilized layered mud, which was scored to aid attachment to a top layer of thick gypsum plaster. The presence of both frescoes in the same room and the better preservation of the \"Investiture\" scene could mean that \"Investiture\" was an earlier painting, and that the concealing of this fresco by the later procession scene is what saved it from suffering the same degree of damage as the palace's other frescoes.\n\nA number of wall-painting fragments were also discovered in from the south-western end of narrow room that Parrot dubbed the \"king's audience chamber.\" These fragments were restored to a size of 2.8 meters (nearly ten feet) in height and 3.35 meters (nearly eleven feet) in width.\n\nThe paintings include two major registers, each depicting a scene in which offerings are made to deities. The scenes are framed by mythological creatures and bordered top and bottom by striding men carrying bundles on their backs. The figures are outlined with thick black line, with red, gray, brown, yellow, and white pigments utilized throughout the painting.\n\nPainting fragments found in the same room as the \"Investiture of Zimri-Lim\" and the sacrificial procession scene include goats in heraldic pose flanking a tree, a life-size figure with a dagger in his belt, a figure in front of an architectural background, and a hand grasping hair in a manner very similar to the traditional Egyptian scene of a king smiting an enemy with a mace.\n\nOthers rooms yielded very fragmentary wall paintings, which may have fallen and broken partly as a result of the collapse of an upper story. The fragments fall into two general stylistic groups: figures resembling the bundle-bearing men in the \"audience chamber\" frescoes, and life-size figures bearing similarity to the sacrificial procession scene.\n\n"}

It trains participants and runs arts and development programmes across all of the creative arts: visual arts, music, dance, writing and acting. Shape Arts partners with major cultural institutions to create positive change for disabled people by improving access, exposure and opportunities in contemporary art.\n\nShape was founded by Gina Levete MBE in 1976 with project funding from the Gulbenkian Foundation. The current CEO is Tony Heaton OBE.\n\nShape was informed by the political activism of the 60s. Disability arts grew out of the disability rights movement, and the wider struggle by disabled people for equality and the right to participate in all aspects of society.\n\nTheir mission is to provide skills, opportunities and support for disabled artists, individuals and cultural organisations; and help build a more inclusive cultural sector. It does this through four delivery aims:\n\n\nShape Arts arranges exhibitions, awards bursaries to promising disabled artists and provides training in media and marketing skills. From December 2012 - Spring 2013, a pop-up exhibition entitled 'Shape in the City' was presented in the centre of the City of London. Shape recently had a temporary exhibition space for two years - a gallery at Westfield Stratford City.\n\n\nRenowned British contemporary artists have donated artworks to Shape to raise money for the charity through an auction at Bonhams. Funds raised from the sale were matched by the Arts Council’s Catalyst Arts Fund and went towards supporting new arts activities and opportunities for disabled people. Works by Jake and Dinos Chapman, Mat Collishaw, Angela de la Cruz, Tacita Dean, Sir Antony Gormley, Marc Quinn and David Shrigley were auctioned at Bonhams London on 4 March 2014.\n\nIn 2016, an online auction at Paddle8 included donations of twenty-five artworks from a range of internationally acclaimed artists including Jeremy Deller, Julie Umerle, Candida Hofer, Ragnar Kjartansson, Hito Steyerl, Grayson Perry and Hans Op de Beeck in support of Shape Arts' 40th anniversary and the continued importance of the organisation's work.\n\nThe Adam Reynolds Memorial Bursary was inaugurated in 2008 in memory of the sculptor Adam Reynolds (1959-2005). It is one of the most significant opportunities for disabled visual artists in the UK, offering an opportunity to engage in a three-month residency at a high-profile gallery. Venues that have hosted the residencies include the V & A, Camden Arts Centre, Spike Island, The BALTIC, the Bluecoat Gallery and New Art Gallery Walsall.\n\n"}
{"id": "1460251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1460251", "title": "Sirenomelia", "text": "Sirenomelia\n\nSirenomelia, also called mermaid syndrome, is a rare congenital deformity in which the legs are fused together.\n\nThe word \"sirenomelia\" derives from the ancient Greek word \"seirēn,\" referring to the mythological Sirens, who were sometimes depicted as mermaids, and \"melos\", meaning \"limb\".\n\nSirenomelia is mainly characterized by the fusion of both legs with rotation of the fibula. It often also includes single umbilical artery, anal and rectal atresia, little to no development of the genitals, renal agenesis, and sacral agenesis or dysplasia. Less severe cases involve a single poorly functioning kidney rather than full renal agenesis. In general, the more severe cases of limb fusion correlate with more severe dysplasia in the pelvis. Rather than the two iliac arteries present in fetuses with complete renal agenesis, fetuses with sirenomelia display no branching of the abdominal aorta, which is always absent.\n\nAssociated defects recorded in cases of sirenomelia include neural tube defects (rachischisis, anencephaly, and spina bifida), holoprosencephaly, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, other heart defects, esophageal atresia, omphalocele, intestinal malrotation, persistent cloaca, and other limb defects (most commonly absence of the radius).\n\nThough obvious at birth, sirenomelia can be diagnosed as early as 14 weeks gestation on prenatal ultrasound. When there is low amniotic fluid around the fetus (oligohydramnios), the diagnosis is more difficult.\n\nThe ultimate cause of sirenomelia is a subject of debate.The first hypothesis of its origin was developed in 1927 and proposed that a lack of blood supply to the lower limbs during their development is responsible for the defect. This \"vascular steal\" hypothesis was developed in response to the observed absence or severe underdevelopment of the aorta below the umbilical artery, which \"steals\" the blood supply from the lower limbs. Other hypotheses involve an insult to the embryo between 28–32 days affecting the caudal mesoderm, a teratogen exposure affecting the neural tube during neurulation, and a defect in the twinning process that either stops the process of caudal differentiation or generates a second primitive streak.\n\nMaternal diabetes mellitus has been associated with caudal regression syndrome and sirenomelia, although a few sources question this association. Prenatal cocaine exposure has also been suggested as an association with sirenomelia.\n\nIn animal models, several genes have been found to cause or be associated with sirenomelia. The \"srn\" (\"siren\") gene is observed to cause hindlimb fusion in homozygous mice. Mice with knockouts or mutations in both \"tsg1\" and \"bmp7\" will also have hindlimb fusion.\n\nSirenomelia is classified by the skeletal structure of the lower limb, ranging from class I, where all bones are present and only the soft tissues are fused, to class VII where the only bone present is a fused femur.\n\nIt has also been classified as an expanded part of the VACTERL association and as a form of caudal regression syndrome.\n\nSirenomelia is usually fatal. Many pregnancies with a sirenomelic fetus spontaneously miscarry. One-third to one-half of infants are stillborn, with all but a few dying in the neonatal period.\n\nIn cases of monoamniotic twins where one is affected, the twin with sirenomelia is protected from Potter sequence (particularly pulmonary hypoplasia and abnormal facies) by the normal twin's production of amniotic fluid.\n\nThis condition is found in approximately one out of every 100,000 live births; studies produce rates from 1 in 68,741 to 1 in 97,807. It is 100 to 150 times more likely in identical (monozygotic) twins than in singletons or fraternal twins. Sirenomelia is not associated with any ethnic background, but fetuses with sirenomelia are more likely to have testes.\n\nSirenomelia was first reported in 1542. In 1927, Otto Kampmeier discovered the association between sirenomelia and single umbilical artery.\n\nOnly a few individuals who had some functioning kidney tissue have survived the neonatal period.\n\nTiffany Yorks of Clearwater, Florida (May 7, 1988 - February 24, 2016) underwent successful surgery in order to separate her legs before she was a year old. She was the longest-surviving sirenomelia patient to date. She suffered mobility issues due to her fragile leg bones, and compensated by using crutches or a wheelchair. She died on February 24, 2016 at the age of 27.\n\nShiloh Jade Pepin (August 4, 1999 – October 23, 2009) was born in Kennebunkport, Maine, United States with her lower extremities fused, no bladder, no uterus, no rectum, only 6 inches of large colon, no vagina, and with only one quarter of a kidney and one ovary. Her parents initially anticipated she could expect only a few months of life. At age 3, her natural kidney failed, and she began dialysis. A kidney transplant at age 2 lasted a number of years, and in 2007 a second kidney transplant was successful. She attended Consolidated Elementary School. She remained hopeful about her disease and joked often and lived her life happily, despite her challenges, as seen in her TLC documentary in \"Extraordinary People: Mermaid Girl\". Shiloh and her family were debating surgery because of the risks involved, even though it would improve her quality of life. Many people who have this condition receive surgery when they are young, but Shiloh was already 8 years old in the documentary and had not received surgery. Shiloh was the only one of the three survivors of sirenomelia without surgery for separation of the conjoined legs. She died of pneumonia on October 23, 2009, at Maine Medical Center in Portland, Maine, at the age of 10; having appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show on September 22, 2009. Shiloh gained a following of admirers by documenting her condition on TV, Facebook, and the Internet.\n\nMilagros Cerrón Arauco was born on April 27, 2004, in Huancayo, Peru. Although most of Milagros’ internal organs, including her heart and lungs, are in perfect condition, she was born with serious internal defects, including a deformed left kidney and a very small right one located very low in her body. In addition, her digestive, urinary tracts and genitals share a single tube.\nThis birth defect occurs during the gastrulation week (week 3) of embryonic development. Gastrulation establishes the three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. It seems that complications such as defects in the urogenital system as mentioned above can be possibly due to malformations in the intermediate mesoderm.\n\nA four-hour operation to insert silicone bags between her legs to stretch the skin was successfully completed on February 8, 2005. A successful operation to separate her legs to just above the knee took place May 31, 2005, in a \"Solidarity Hospital\" in the district of Surquillo in Lima. The procedure, however, was so intensive that she became traumatized to the degree of losing her ability to form proper speech patterns, leaving her nearly mute. It is not yet known if this is a physiological or psychological condition. However, at Milagros' second birthday, her mother reported that she knew more than 50 words. A second operation to complete the separation up to the groin took place on September 7, 2006.\n\nHer doctor Luis Rubio said he was pleased with the progress Milagros had made, but cautioned that she still needed 10 to 15 years of rehabilitation and more operations before she could lead a normal life. Particularly, she will require reconstructive surgery to rebuild her rudimentary anus, urethra and genitalia.\n\nMilagros' parents are from a poor village in Peru's Andes Mountains; the Solidarity Hospital has given a job to her father Ricardo Cerrón so that the family can remain in Lima, while the City of Lima has pledged to pay for many of the operations.\n"}

{"id": "26342598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26342598", "title": "The Autobiography of Malcolm X", "text": "The Autobiography of Malcolm X\n\nThe Autobiography of Malcolm X was published in 1965, the result of a collaboration between human rights activist Malcolm X and journalist Alex Haley. Haley coauthored the autobiography based on a series of in-depth interviews he conducted between 1963 and Malcolm X's 1965 assassination. The \"Autobiography\" is a spiritual conversion narrative that outlines Malcolm X's philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. After the leader was killed, Haley wrote the book's epilogue. He described their collaborative process and the events at the end of Malcolm X's life.\n\nWhile Malcolm X and scholars contemporary to the book's publication regarded Haley as the book's ghostwriter, modern scholars tend to regard him as an essential collaborator. They say he intentionally muted his authorial voice to create the effect of Malcolm X speaking directly to readers. Haley influenced some of Malcolm X's literary choices. For example, Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam during the period when he was working on the book with Haley. Rather than rewriting earlier chapters as a polemic against the Nation which Malcolm X had rejected, Haley persuaded him to favor a style of \"suspense and drama\". According to Manning Marable, \"Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as Malcolm X's anti-Semitism\" and he rewrote material to eliminate it.\n\nWhen the \"Autobiography\" was published, \"The New York Times\" reviewer described it as a \"brilliant, painful, important book\". In 1967, historian John William Ward wrote that it would become a classic American autobiography. In 1998, \"Time\" named \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" as one of ten \"required reading\" nonfiction books. James Baldwin and Arnold Perl adapted the book as a film; their screenplay provided the source material for Spike Lee's 1992 film \"Malcolm X\".\n\nPublished posthumously, \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" is an account of the life of Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little (1925–1965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book describes Malcolm's childhood in Michigan, the death of his father under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her commitment to a psychiatric hospital. Little's young adulthood in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in organized crime. This led to his arrest and subsequent eight- to ten-year prison sentence, of which he served six-and-a-half years (1946–1952). The book addresses his ministry with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam (1952–1963) and his emergence as the organization's national spokesman. It documents his disillusionment with and departure from the Nation of Islam in March 1964, his pilgrimage to Mecca, which catalyzed his conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam, and his travels in Africa. Malcolm X was assassinated in New York's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965, before they finished the book. His co-author, journalist Alex Haley, summarizes the last days of Malcolm X's life, and describes in detail their working agreement, including Haley's personal views on his subject, in the \"Autobiography\"s epilogue.\n\nThe \"Autobiography\" is a spiritual conversion narrative that outlines Malcolm X's philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. Literary critic Arnold Rampersad and Malcolm X biographer Michael Eric Dyson agree that the narrative of the \"Autobiography\" resembles the Augustinian approach to confessional narrative. Augustine's \"Confessions\" and \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" both relate the early hedonistic lives of their subjects, document deep philosophical change for spiritual reasons, and describe later disillusionment with religious groups their subjects had once revered. Haley and autobiographical scholar Albert E. Stone compare the narrative to the Icarus myth. Author Paul John Eakin and writer Alex Gillespie suggest that part of the \"Autobiography\"s rhetorical power comes from \"the vision of a man whose swiftly unfolding career had outstripped the possibilities of the traditional autobiography he had meant to write\", thus destroying \"the illusion of the finished and unified personality\".\n\nIn addition to functioning as a spiritual conversion narrative, \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" also reflects generic elements from other distinctly American literary forms, from the Puritan conversion narrative of Jonathan Edwards and the secular self-analyses of Benjamin Franklin, to the African American slave narratives. This aesthetic decision on the part of Malcolm X and Haley also has profound implications for the thematic content of the work, as the progressive movement between forms that is evidenced in the text reflects the personal progression of its subject. Considering this, the editors of the \"Norton Anthology of African American Literature\" assert that, \"Malcolm's \"Autobiography\" takes pains to interrogate the very models through which his persona achieves gradual self-understanding...his story's inner logic defines his life as a quest for an authentic mode of being, a quest that demands a constant openness to new ideas requiring fresh kinds of expression.\"\n\nHaley coauthored \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\", and also performed the basic functions of a ghostwriter and biographical amanuensis, writing, compiling, and editing the \"Autobiography\" based on more than 50 in-depth interviews he conducted with Malcolm X between 1963 and his subject's 1965 assassination. The two first met in 1959, when Haley wrote an article about the Nation of Islam for \"Reader's Digest\", and again when Haley interviewed Malcolm X for \"Playboy\" in 1962.\n\nIn 1963 the Doubleday publishing company asked Haley to write a book about the life of Malcolm X. American writer and literary critic Harold Bloom writes, \"When Haley approached Malcolm with the idea, Malcolm gave him a startled look ...\" Haley recalls, \"It was one of the few times I have ever seen him uncertain.\" After Malcolm X was granted permission from Elijah Muhammad, he and Haley commenced work on the \"Autobiography\", a process which began as two-and three-hour interview sessions at Haley's studio in Greenwich Village. Bloom writes, \"Malcolm was critical of Haley's middle-class status, as well as his Christian beliefs and twenty years of service in the U.S. Military.\"\n\nWhen work on the \"Autobiography\" began in early 1963, Haley grew frustrated with Malcolm X's tendency to speak only about Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. Haley reminded him that the book was supposed to be about Malcolm X, not Muhammad or the Nation of Islam, a comment which angered Malcolm X. Haley eventually shifted the focus of the interviews toward the life of his subject when he asked Malcolm X about his mother:\nI said, 'Mr. Malcolm, could you tell me something about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.\nThough Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the \"Autobiography\", modern scholars tend to treat him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure in the composition of the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing what looked like verbatim copy. However, Malcolm X biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of the \"Autobiography\", or the full relationship between Malcolm X and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.\n\nHaley's contribution to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss how it should be characterized. In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, psychobiographical writer Eugene Victor Wolfenstein writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-psychoanalytic Freudian psychiatrist and spiritual confessor. Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, that the act of self-narration was itself a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.\n\nHaley exercised discretion over content, guided Malcolm X in critical stylistic and rhetorical choices, and compiled the work. In the epilogue to the \"Autobiography\", Haley describes an agreement he made with Malcolm X, who demanded that: \"Nothing can be in this book's manuscript that I didn't say and nothing can be left out that I want in it.\" As such, Haley wrote an addendum to the contract specifically referring to the book as an \"as told to\" account. In the agreement, Haley gained an \"important concession\": \"I asked for—and he gave—his permission that at the end of the book I could write comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review.\" These comments became the epilogue to the \"Autobiography\", which Haley wrote after the death of his subject.\n\nIn \"Malcolm X: The Art of Autobiography\", writer and professor John Edgar Wideman examines in detail the narrative landscapes found in biography. Wideman suggests that as a writer, Haley was attempting to satisfy \"multiple allegiances\": to his subject, to his publisher, to his \"editor's agenda\", and to himself. Haley was an important contributor to the \"Autobiography\"s popular appeal, writes Wideman. Wideman expounds upon the \"inevitable compromise\" of biographers, and argues that in order to allow readers to insert themselves into the broader socio-psychological narrative, neither coauthor's voice is as strong as it could have been. Wideman details some of the specific pitfalls Haley encountered while coauthoring the \"Autobiography\":\nYou are serving many masters, and inevitably you are compromised. The man speaks and you listen but you do not take notes, the first compromise and perhaps betrayal. You may attempt through various stylistic conventions and devices to reconstitute for the reader your experience of hearing face to face the man's words. The sound of the man's narration may be represented by vocabulary, syntax, imagery, graphic devices of various sorts—quotation marks, punctuation, line breaks, visual patterning of white space and black space, markers that encode print analogs to speech—vernacular interjections, parentheses, ellipses, asterisks, footnotes, italics, dashes ...\nIn the body of the \"Autobiography\", Wideman writes, Haley's authorial agency is seemingly absent: \"Haley does so much with so little fuss ... an approach that appears so rudimentary in fact conceals sophisticated choices, quiet mastery of a medium\". Wideman argues that Haley wrote the body of the \"Autobiography\" in a manner of Malcolm X's choosing and the epilogue as an extension of the biography itself, his subject having given him carte blanche for the chapter. Haley's voice in the body of the book is a tactic, Wideman writes, producing a text nominally written by Malcolm X but seemingly written by no author. The subsumption of Haley's own voice in the narrative allows the reader to feel as though the voice of Malcolm X is speaking directly and continuously, a stylistic tactic that, in Wideman's view, was a matter of Haley's authorial choice: \"Haley grants Malcolm the tyrannical authority of an author, a disembodied speaker whose implied presence blends into the reader's imagining of the tale being told.\"\n\nIn \"Two Create One: The Act of Collaboration in Recent Black Autobiography: Ossie Guffy, Nate Shaw, and Malcolm X\", Stone argues that Haley played an \"essential role\" in \"recovering the historical identity\" of Malcolm X. Stone also reminds the reader that collaboration is a cooperative endeavor, requiring more than Haley's prose alone can provide, \"convincing and coherent\" as it may be:\nThough a writer's skill and imagination have combined words and voice into a more or less convincing and coherent narrative, the actual writer [Haley] has no large fund of memories to draw upon: the subject's [Malcolm X] memory and imagination are the original sources of the arranged story and have also come into play critically as the text takes final shape. Thus \"where\" material comes from, and \"what\" has been done to it are separable and of equal significance in collaborations.\nIn Stone's estimation, supported by Wideman, the source of autobiographical material and the efforts made to shape them into a workable narrative are distinct, and of equal value in a critical assessment of the collaboration that produced the \"Autobiography\". While Haley's skills as writer have significant influence on the narrative's shape, Stone writes, they require a \"subject possessed of a powerful memory and imagination\" to produce a workable narrative.\n\nThe collaboration between Malcolm X and Haley took on many dimensions; editing, revising and composing the \"Autobiography\" was a power struggle between two men with sometimes competing ideas of the final shape for the book. Haley \"took pains to show how Malcolm dominated their relationship and tried to control the composition of the book\", writes Rampersad. Rampersad also writes that Haley was aware that memory is selective and that autobiographies are \"almost by definition projects in fiction\", and that it was his responsibility as biographer to select material based on his authorial discretion. The narrative shape crafted by Haley and Malcolm X is the result of a life account \"distorted and diminished\" by the \"process of selection\", Rampersad suggests, yet the narrative's shape may in actuality be more revealing than the narrative itself. In the epilogue Haley describes the process used to edit the manuscript, giving specific examples of how Malcolm X controlled the language.\n\nWhile Haley ultimately deferred to Malcolm X's specific choice of words when composing the manuscript, Wideman writes, \"the nature of writing biography or autobiography ... means that Haley's promise to Malcolm, his intent to be a 'dispassionate chronicler', is a matter of disguising, not removing, his authorial presence.\" Haley played an important role in persuading Malcolm X not to re-edit the book as a polemic against Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam at a time when Haley already had most of the material needed to complete the book, and asserted his authorial agency when the \"Autobiography\"s \"fractured construction\", caused by Malcolm X's rift with Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, \"overturned the design\" of the manuscript and created a narrative crisis. In the \"Autobiography\"s epilogue, Haley describes the incident:\nI sent Malcolm X some rough chapters to read. I was appalled when they were soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning Malcolm X, I reminded him of his previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. Malcolm X said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night Malcolm X telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. I was upset about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.\n\nHaley's warning to avoid \"telegraphing to readers\" and his advice about \"building suspense and drama\" demonstrate his efforts to influence the narrative's content and assert his authorial agency while ultimately deferring final discretion to Malcolm X. In the above passage Haley asserts his authorial presence, reminding his subject that as a writer he has concerns about narrative direction and focus, but presenting himself in such a way as to give no doubt that he deferred final approval to his subject. In the words of Eakin, \"Because this complex vision of his existence is clearly not that of the early sections of the \"Autobiography\", Alex Haley and Malcolm X were forced to confront the consequences of this discontinuity in perspective for the narrative, already a year old.\" Malcolm X, after giving the matter some thought, later accepted Haley's suggestion.\n\nWhile Marable argues that Malcolm X was his own best revisionist, he also points out that Haley's collaborative role in shaping the \"Autobiography\" was notable. Haley influenced the narrative's direction and tone while remaining faithful to his subject's syntax and diction. Marable writes that Haley worked \"hundreds of sentences into paragraphs\", and organized them into \"subject areas\". Author William L. Andrews writes:\n[T]he narrative evolved out of Haley's interviews with Malcolm, but Malcolm had read Haley's typescript, and had made interlineated notes and often stipulated substantive changes, at least in the earlier parts of the text. As the work progressed, however, according to Haley, Malcolm yielded more and more to the authority of his ghostwriter, partly because Haley never let Malcolm read the manuscript unless he was present to defend it, partly because in his last months Malcolm had less and less opportunity to reflect on the text of his life because he was so busy living it, and partly because Malcolm had eventually resigned himself to letting Haley's ideas about effective storytelling take precedence over his own desire to denounce straightaway those whom he had once revered.\n\nAndrews suggests that Haley's role expanded because the book's subject became less available to micro-manage the manuscript, and \"Malcolm had eventually resigned himself\" to allowing \"Haley's ideas about effective storytelling\" to shape the narrative.\n\nMarable studied the \"Autobiography\" manuscript \"raw materials\" archived by Haley's biographer, Anne Romaine, and described a critical element of the collaboration, Haley's writing tactic to capture the voice of his subject accurately, a disjoint system of data mining that included notes on scrap paper, in-depth interviews, and long \"free style\" discussions. Marable writes, \"Malcolm also had a habit of scribbling notes to himself as he spoke.\" Haley would secretly \"pocket these sketchy notes\" and reassemble them in a sub rosa attempt to integrate Malcolm X's \"subconscious reflections\" into the \"workable narrative\". This is an example of Haley asserting authorial agency during the writing of the \"Autobiography\", indicating that their relationship was fraught with minor power struggles. Wideman and Rampersad agree with Marable's description of Haley's book-writing process.\n\nThe timing of the collaboration meant that Haley occupied an advantageous position to document the multiple conversion experiences of Malcolm X and his challenge was to form them, however incongruent, into a cohesive workable narrative. Dyson suggests that \"profound personal, intellectual, and ideological changes ... led him to order events of his life to support a mythology of metamorphosis and transformation\". Marable addresses the confounding factors of the publisher and Haley's authorial influence, passages that support the argument that while Malcolm X may have considered Haley a ghostwriter, he acted in actuality as a coauthor, at times without Malcolm X's direct knowledge or expressed consent:\nAlthough Malcolm X retained final approval of their hybrid text, he was not privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as Malcolm X's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past Malcolm X,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of Malcolm X had begun well \"prior\" to his assassination.\nMarable says the resulting text was stylistically and ideologically distinct from what Marable believes Malcolm X would have written without Haley's influence, and it also differs from what may have actually been said in the interviews between Haley and Malcolm X.\n\nIn \"Making Malcolm: The Myth and Meaning of Malcolm X\", Dyson criticizes historians and biographers of the time for re-purposing the \"Autobiography\" as a transcendent narrative by a \"mythological\" Malcolm X without being critical enough of the underlying ideas. Further, because much of the available biographical studies of Malcolm X have been written by white authors, Dyson suggests their ability to \"interpret black experience\" is suspect. \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\", Dyson says, reflects both Malcolm X's goal of narrating his life story for public consumption and Haley's political ideologies. Dyson writes, \"\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" ... has been criticized for avoiding or distorting certain facts. Indeed, the autobiography is as much a testament to Haley's ingenuity in shaping the manuscript as it is a record of Malcolm's attempt to tell his story.\"\nRampersad suggests that Haley understood autobiographies as \"almost fiction\". In \"The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's \"Malcolm\" and Malcolm's Malcolm\", Rampersad criticizes Perry's biography, \"Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America\", and makes the general point that the writing of the \"Autobiography\" is part of the narrative of blackness in the 20th century and consequently should \"not be held utterly beyond inquiry\". To Rampersad, the \"Autobiography\" is about psychology, ideology, a conversion narrative, and the myth-making process. \"Malcolm inscribed in it the terms of his understanding of the form even as the unstable, even treacherous form concealed and distorted particular aspects of his quest. But there is no Malcolm untouched by doubt or fiction. Malcolm's Malcolm is in itself a fabrication; the 'truth' about him is impossible to know.\" Rampersad suggests that since his 1965 assassination, Malcolm X has \"become the desires of his admirers, who have reshaped memory, historical record and the autobiography according to their wishes, which is to say, according to their needs as they perceive them.\" Further, Rampersad says, many admirers of Malcolm X perceive \"accomplished and admirable\" figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., and W. E. B. Du Bois inadequate to fully express black humanity as it struggles with oppression, \"while Malcolm is seen as the apotheosis of black individual greatness ... he is a perfect hero—his wisdom is surpassing, his courage definitive, his sacrifice messianic\". Rampersad suggests that devotees have helped shape the myth of Malcolm X.\n\nAuthor Joe Wood writes:\n[T]he autobiography iconizes Malcolm twice, not once. Its second Malcolm—the El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz finale—is a mask with no distinct ideology, it is not particularly Islamic, not particularly nationalist, not particularly humanist. Like any well crafted icon or story, the mask is evidence of its subject's humanity, of Malcolm's strong human spirit. But both masks hide as much character as they show. The first mask served a nationalism Malcolm had rejected before the book was finished; the second is mostly empty and available.\nTo Eakin, a significant portion of the \"Autobiography\" involves Haley and Malcolm X shaping the fiction of the completed self. Stone writes that Haley's description of the \"Autobiography\"s composition makes clear that this fiction is \"especially misleading in the case of Malcolm X\"; both Haley and the \"Autobiography\" itself are \"out of phase\" with its subject's \"life and identity\". Dyson writes, \"[Louis] Lomax says that Malcolm became a 'lukewarm integrationist'. [Peter] Goldman suggests that Malcolm was 'improvising', that he embraced and discarded ideological options as he went along. [Albert] Cleage and [Oba] T'Shaka hold that he remained a revolutionary black nationalist. And [James Hal] Cone asserts that he became an internationalist with a humanist bent.\" Marable writes that Malcolm X was a \"committed internationalist\" and \"black nationalist\" at the end of his life, not an \"integrationist\", noting, \"what I find in my own research is greater continuity than discontinuity\".\n\nMarable, in \"Rediscovering Malcolm's Life: A Historian's Adventures in Living History\", critically analyzes the collaboration that produced the \"Autobiography\". Marable argues autobiographical \"memoirs\" are \"inherently biased\", representing the subject as he would appear with certain facts privileged, others deliberately omitted. Autobiographical narratives self-censor, reorder event chronology, and alter names. According to Marable, \"nearly everyone writing about Malcolm X\" has failed to critically and objectively analyze and research the subject properly. Marable suggests that most historians have assumed that the \"Autobiography\" is veritable truth, devoid of any ideological influence or stylistic embellishment by Malcolm X or Haley. Further, Marable believes the \"most talented revisionist of Malcolm X, was Malcolm X\", who actively fashioned and reinvented his public image and verbiage so as to increase favor with diverse groups of people in various situations.\n\nHaley writes that during the last months of Malcolm X's life \"uncertainty and confusion\" about his views were widespread in Harlem, his base of operations. In an interview four days before his death Malcolm X said, \"I'm man enough to tell you that I can't put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'm flexible.\" Malcolm X had not yet formulated a cohesive Black ideology at the time of his assassination and, Dyson writes, was \"experiencing a radical shift\" in his core \"personal and political understandings\".\n\nEliot Fremont-Smith, reviewing \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" for \"The New York Times\" in 1965, described it as \"extraordinary\" and said it is a \"brilliant, painful, important book\". Two years later, historian John William Ward wrote that the book \"will surely become one of the classics in American autobiography\". Bayard Rustin argued the book suffered from a lack of critical analysis, which he attributed to Malcolm X's expectation that Haley be a \"chronicler, not an interpreter.\" \"Newsweek\" also highlighted the limited insight and criticism in \"The Autobiography\" but praised it for power and poignance. However, Truman Nelson in \"The Nation\" lauded the epilogue as revelatory and described Haley as a \"skillful amanuensis\". \"Variety\" called it a \"mesmerizing page-turner\" in 1992, and in 1998, \"Time\" named \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" one of ten \"required reading\" nonfiction books.\n\n\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" has influenced generations of readers. In 1990, Charles Solomon writes in the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Unlike many '60s icons, \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\", with its double message of anger and love, remains an inspiring document.\" Cultural historian Howard Bruce Franklin describes it as \"one of the most influential books in late-twentieth-century American culture\", and the \"Concise Oxford Companion to African American Literature\" credits Haley with shaping \"what has undoubtedly become the most influential twentieth-century African American autobiography\".\n\nConsidering the literary impact of Malcolm X's \"Autobiography\", we may note the tremendous influence of the book, as well as its subject generally, on the development of the Black Arts Movement. Indeed, it was the day after Malcolm's assassination that the poet and playwright, Amiri Baraka, established the Black Arts Repertory Theater, which would serve to catalyze the aesthetic progression of the movement. Writers and thinkers associated with the Black Arts movement found in the \"Autobiography\" an aesthetic embodiment of his profoundly influential qualities, namely, \"the vibrancy of his public voice, the clarity of his analyses of oppression's hidden history and inner logic, the fearlessness of his opposition to white supremacy, and the unconstrained ardor of his advocacy for revolution 'by any means necessary.'\"\n\nbell hooks writes \"When I was a young college student in the early seventies, the book I read which revolutionized my thinking about race and politics was \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\".\" David Bradley adds:\n\nShe [hooks] is not alone. Ask any middle-aged socially conscious intellectual to list the books that influenced his or her youthful thinking, and he or she will most likely mention \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\". Some will do more than mention it. Some will say that ... they picked it up—by accident, or maybe by assignment, or because a friend pressed it on them—and that they approached the reading of it without great expectations, but somehow that book ... took hold of them. Got \"inside\" them. Altered their vision, their outlook, their insight. Changed their lives.\n\nMax Elbaum concurs, writing that \"\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" was without question the single most widely read and influential book among young people of all racial backgrounds who went to their first demonstration sometime between 1965 and 1968.\"\n\nAt the end of his tenure as the first African-American U.S. Attorney General, Eric Holder selected \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" when asked what book he would recommend to a young person coming to Washington, D.C.\n\nDoubleday had contracted to publish \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" and paid a $30,000 advance to Malcolm X and Haley in 1963. In March 1965, three weeks after Malcolm X's assassination, Nelson Doubleday, Jr., canceled its contract out of fear for the safety of his employees. Grove Press then published the book later that year. Since \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" has sold millions of copies, Marable described Doubleday's choice as the \"most disastrous decision in corporate publishing history\".\n\n\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" has sold well since its 1965 publication. According to \"The New York Times\", the paperback edition sold 400,000 copies in 1967 and 800,000 copies the following year. The \"Autobiography\" entered its 18th printing by 1970. \"The New York Times\" reported that six million copies of the book had been sold by 1977. The book experienced increased readership and returned to the best-seller list in the 1990s, helped in part by the publicity surrounding Spike Lee's 1992 film \"Malcolm X\". Between 1989 and 1992, sales of the book increased by 300%.\n\nIn 1968 film producer Marvin Worth hired novelist James Baldwin to write a screenplay based on \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\"; Baldwin was joined by screenwriter Arnold Perl, who died in 1971 before the screenplay could be finished. Baldwin developed his work on the screenplay into the book \"One Day, When I Was Lost: A Scenario Based on Alex Haley's \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\"\", published in 1972. Other authors who attempted to draft screenplays include playwright David Mamet, novelist David Bradley, author Charles Fuller, and screenwriter Calder Willingham. Director Spike Lee revised the Baldwin-Perl script for his 1992 film \"Malcolm X\".\n\nIn 1992, attorney Gregory Reed bought the original manuscripts of \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" for $100,000 at the sale of the Haley Estate. The manuscripts included three \"missing chapters\", titled \"The Negro\", \"The End of Christianity\", and \"Twenty Million Black Muslims\", that were omitted from the original text. In a 1964 letter to his publisher, Haley had described these chapters as, \"the most material of the book, some of it rather lava-like\". Marable writes that the missing chapters were \"dictated and written\" during Malcolm X's final months in the Nation of Islam. In them, Marable says, Malcolm X proposed the establishment of a union of African American civic and political organizations. Marable wonders whether this project might have led some within the Nation of Islam and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to try to silence Malcolm X. In April 2010, the \"New York Post\" reported that the missing chapters would be published with a foreword by Malcolm X's daughter Ilyasah Shabazz.\n\nThe book has been published in more than 45 editions and in many languages, including Arabic, German, French, Indonesian. Important editions include:\n\n\n\n"}
