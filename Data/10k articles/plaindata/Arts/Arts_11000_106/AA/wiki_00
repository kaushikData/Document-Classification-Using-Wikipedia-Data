Hardy revised all four of these stories significantly before adding them to the collection in 1891. The remaining six stories were written in early 1890 and published in bowdlerised form in a special Christmas number of \"The Graphic\" in December 1890.\n\nHardy collected all ten stories together for the first time in \"A Group of Noble Dames\", which was published in England by Osgood, McIlvaine, & Co. and in America by Harper & Brothers in 1891.

{"id": "33261227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33261227", "title": "Celia (As You Like It)", "text": "Celia (As You Like It)\n\nCelia is one of the important characters of Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\".\n\nCelia is the daughter of Duke Frederick and niece of the banished Duke Senior. Celia and Rosalind are cousins but they have sisterly affection.\nCelia is beautiful, but with a beauty less sparkling than that of Rosalind. Orlando describes both of them as 'fair and excellent ladies'. \n\nCelia is shorter than her cousin and less majestic in appearance. She has a gentle expression combined with a habitual serious appearance. Hence Rosalind addresses her at one time as 'my pretty little coz', and at another as, 'sad brow and true maid'.\n\nCelia's love for Rosalind knows no limits and is frequently referred to in the play. Charles, the wrestler, relates that Celia loves her cousin so much that she would have followed Rosalind into exile in case Rosalind too had been banished along with her father.\n\nLe Beau, the courtier, describes their love as 'dearer than the natural bond of sisters'. This shows that her love for cousin is pure and supreme.\n\nCelia is silent and reserved. She is more conventional than Rosalind and hence more worldly and prudent. Her silence is in contrast to Rosalind's talkative nature. However, Celia, by her prudence, exercises command over herself as well as over others. When the two cousins are alone, Celia is full of life and humour, but in the presence of others she is content to play the part of a spectator. She first listens and judges what to speak, exactly opposite to Rosalind. Some consider that Celia's individual character has been overlooked by literary critics in favour of the more central character of Rosalind.\n\nCelia's love for Oliver is sudden, intense and uncontrollable, despite the knowledge of Oliver's past wicked deeds. In this connection, it should be remembered that love in Shakespeare is an irrational passion.\n\nCelia's marriage with Oliver has been criticised by many critics. Stopford Brooke opines that this marriage is against probability because it looks strange that Oliver should change in a moment from the scoundrel. But her marriage with Oliver does not bring disgrace to her character. Oliver was a bad character but has changed into a good one by a sudden stroke. So Celia's marriage with Oliver is not a blot on her character.\n\nIt has been suggested that Celia's role in the play is \"subversive\", in the sense that she adds to the sexual complications of the plot by her friendship with the cross-dressing Rosalind. Celia effectively sets up home with Rosalind in the forest, requiring no male presence, and her marriage to Oliver may be regarded as a means of prolonging their relationship rather than the result of any affection she feels for him.\n\nCelia has been played by various notable actresses on screen. Sophie Stewart played Celia in a 1936 film, Rosalind Knight in the 1963 UK television series, Angharad Rees in the 1978 BBC version of the play directed by Basil Coleman, and Romola Garai in the 2006 production directed by Kenneth Branagh. In a 1985 production by the Royal Shakespeare Company, Celia was played by Fiona Shaw. Sophie Thompson played Celia with the Renaissance Theatre Company, and in 1989 it was her first role with the RSC.\n"}

The course, published between 1866 and 1871 by Goupil & Cie, comprised 197 lithographs printed as individual sheets, was to guide students from plaster casts to the study of great master drawings and finally to drawing from the living model.

She currently presents for BBC Sport, Channel 4, BT Sport and formerly presented the religious programme \"Good Morning Sunday\" on BBC Radio 2.\n\nBalding was educated at Downe House in Berkshire, where she was Head Girl and a contemporary of comedian Miranda Hart. Hart and Balding are in fact tenth-cousins, sharing a nine-times-great-grandfather in Sir William Leveson-Gower, 4th Baronet.\n\nClare Balding applied to read law at Christ's College, Cambridge, but failed her interview and realised that law was not what she most wanted to do. She later successfully applied to Newnham College, Cambridge, and read English. While at university she was President of the Cambridge Union Society in Easter 1992 and graduated in 1993 with a 2:1 honours degree.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1993, Balding was a leading amateur flat jockey and Champion Lady Rider in 1990. Her memoir \"My Animals and Other Family\" documents her life growing up in a racing yard. It won the National Book Awards \"Autobiography of the Year\" in 2012.\n\nClare Balding has close family links to horse racing: her father, Ian Balding, trained Mill Reef, 1971 winner of The Derby, Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes; and her younger brother, Andrew Balding, trained Casual Look, the winner of the 2003 Epsom Oaks. The latter win led to a very emotional post-race interview with her brother. Her uncle Toby Balding trained winners in the Grand National, Cheltenham Gold Cup and Champion Hurdle. Furthermore, her maternal grandfather was the trainer Peter Hastings-Bass and her maternal uncle the 17th Earl of Huntingdon was once trainer to Queen Elizabeth II. Her maternal grandmother, Priscilla Hastings, is descended from the Earls of Derby and was one of the first women elected to membership of the Jockey Club.\nBalding's well-documented aristocratic lineage on her mother's side can be seen in records that TheGenealogist has identified in research. Researchers found Balding's maternal line reveals that she is the great-granddaughter of Sir Malcolm Bullock whose sexuality was investigated in her episode of the \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" programme first broadcast in July 2017. Balding's paternal grandfather Gerald Barnard Balding Sr, was a 10-goal polo player who travelled to play polo in America in the 1920s when he was in his 20s. Outbound passenger lists on a genealogy website include Balding's grandfather and it was at this time that Gerald Balding Sr met and later married the American heiress, Eleanor Hoagland.\n\nClare became a trainee with BBC National Radio in 1994, working on 5 Live, Radio 1 (presenting the sport on the Chris Evans Breakfast Show), Radio 2 and Radio 4. In June 1995, she made her debut as a television presenter, introducing highlights of Royal Ascot. The following year she began presenting live, and in December 1997 she became the BBC's lead horse racing presenter after the retirement of Julian Wilson, and has fronted coverage of the Grand National.\nInfamously humiliating Liam Treadwell Grand National winner 2009.\n\nBalding has reported from six Olympic Games, for BBC Radio in Atlanta and for BBC Television in Sydney, Athens, Beijing, London and Rio de Janeiro. She has presented four Paralympic Games, the Winter Olympics from Salt Lake City, Turin, Vancouver and Sochi as well as the Commonwealth Games from Melbourne, Delhi and Glasgow. She was the face of the BBC's rugby league coverage, having presented \"Grandstand\" from a Rugby League Challenge Cup semi-final, and having been so impressed by the vibrancy and physical challenge of the sport she asked to cover further rugby league events. She was the last person to present \"Sunday Grandstand\".\n\nShe also presents the Lord Mayor's Show as well as other live events for the BBC, such as Trooping the Colour and New Year's Eve. Clare has presented Crufts for the BBC from 2004 – 2009 and for Channel 4 since 2013.\n\nShe also presents the walking programme \"Ramblings\" for BBC Radio 4 where she walks and talks with one or more devotees of a particular route, area or activity and has, for example, walked sections of the Lyke Wake Walk and Dales Way for the programme.

In August 2012 it was reported that Balding would be presenting Channel 4's racing coverage, while still retaining an option to work for the BBC on non-racing programmes such as rugby league.\n\nIn October 2012, she appeared before an All Party Parliamentary Group on Women's Sport, with Katherine Grainger, Hope Powell and Tanni Grey-Thompson. \"Women having freedom to play sport leads directly to women having political freedom,\" said Balding. In 2013, to mark the centenary of Emily Wilding Davison's fatal intervention in the 1913 Derby, Balding presented a documentary about Davison for Channel 4 called \"Secrets of the Suffragettes\".

Balding was the presenter of \"Good Morning Sunday\" on BBC Radio 2 from January 2013 to November 2017; leaving the show due to schedule changes which would not allow her to continue to present the programme and do other work. Balding also presented a Saturday night quiz show for BBC1 called \"Britain's Brightest\", which began in January 2013, described as \"Ordinary people with extraordinary minds face a series of nail-biting challenges and demanding puzzles as they battle to become crowned as Britain's Brightest\".

Her second book, \"Walking Home: My Family and other Ramblings\", was published in September 2014.\n\nBalding was involved in a copy-control controversy in 2017, when it was alleged that she or her agent rewrote part of an interview that she gave to \"Saga\" magazine, provoking the journalist Ginny Dougary to remove her byline from the interview. According to Dugarry, Balding removed sections of the text and inserted promotional material about her new book, as well as details of her hosting of the women’s European football championships and the words \"And indeed she [Balding] sparkles all the way through the photo shoot,\" despite Dougary commenting that this was not the case and that Balding was rather \"a brisk, jolly-hockey-sticks type\". In a statement, Saga claimed that it had not given Balding copy control and that the interview was edited in conjunction with the author.\n\nBalding was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting and journalism. In the same year, Balding was presented with the special BAFTA for her work on the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nBalding won the Royal Television Society's \"Sports Presenter of the Year\" in 2003 and “Presenter” in 2012. Also in 2003, she won the \"Racing Journalist of the Year Award\" and has followed up with the award for \"Racing Broadcaster of the Year\".\n\nIn December 2012, she was awarded the \"Biography/Autobiography of the Year\" award of the National Book Awards for \"My Animals and Other Family\".\n\nShe also won an achievement award from the UK chapter of the Women in Film and Television in 2012 for her coverage of the Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nBalding was awarded the 2012 Sports Journalists' Association's annual British Sports Journalism Award for Sports Broadcaster of the Year (BBC and Channel 4).\n\nIn February 2013 she was assessed as being one of the 100 most powerful women in the UK by \"Woman's Hour\" on BBC Radio 4. and also won the award for Sports Presenter at the Television and Radio Industries Club Awards.\n\nHer other awards include Attitude Awards TV Personality of the Year 2012, TRIC Sports Presenter of the Year 2013, British Equestrian Federation Outstanding Journalist of the Year 2014 and First Women Awards Lifetime Achievement 2015. Plus awards from \"Red\" magazine, \"Tatler\" and the Horserace Writers' Association.\n\nBalding formalised her relationship with Alice Arnold, then a BBC Radio 4 continuity announcer and newsreader, in September 2006 by entering into a civil partnership. The couple live in Chiswick, London, with their Tibetan terrier, Archie. In April 2015, she and Arnold married in a private ceremony.\n\nOn 29 May 2009, Balding announced that she had thyroid cancer. She told the \"Daily Mail\" newspaper that she had her thyroid gland removed and would have radioactive iodine treatment in July that year. She promised to be back on television covering the Epsom Derby, by the following Saturday. On 21 August 2009, she announced that the radioactive iodine had been successful with no signs of the cancer having spread.\n\nIn July 2010, Balding made a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission over an article by writer A. A. Gill in \"The Sunday Times\" that she felt had mocked her sexuality and appearance and for which the newspaper refused to apologise. The PCC found in her favour, judging that AA Gill had \"refer[red] to the complainant's sexuality in a demeaning and gratuitous way\". In 2014, she was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.\n\nAfter Liam Treadwell's Grand National victory on 4 April 2009, Balding interviewed him and made fun of his apparently bad teeth. Both the BBC and Balding apologised by 6 April. Balding later clarified on BBC's \"Have I Got News For You\" quiz that she believed Treadwell to have had his teeth \"kicked out\" by a horse, a common injury suffered by jockeys, apologising again for her error.\n\nIn 2014, Balding publicly backed Hacked Off and its campaign towards UK press self-regulation by \"safeguarding the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable.\"\n\nBalding's matrilineal great-great-grandparents Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby and Lady Alice Montagu both descended from Henry VII. The earl's lineage can also be traced back to Sir Thomas Frankland. This makes Balding a 11-times-great-granddaughter of Oliver Cromwell.\n\nShe is also descended, via Joseph C. Hoagland, from Sarah Rapelje, the first woman of European descent born in what is now New York, to Dutch-settler parents.\n\nBalding has been a presenter on Sport Relief since its inception in 2002. She also participated in a celebrity edition of \"The Apprentice\" to raise money for charity. \"Sport Relief Does The Apprentice\" is part of the BBC's annual charity initiative and aired on 12 and 14 March 2008. \"The Girls' team\", which also included Louise Redknapp, Jacqueline Gold, Kirstie Allsopp and Lisa Snowdon, won the contest, raising over £400,000 from ticket sales and sales on the night of the big event at their shop.\n\nIn 2010, Balding became a patron of the British Thyroid Foundation.\n\nIn 2015, Balding became an ambassador for Southampton FC's official charity, the Saints Foundation.\n\nShe is also patron to a number of other charities including Riding for the Disabled, British Paralympic Association, Diversity Role Models, Retraining of Racehorses and the Jane Tomlinson Appeal.

Eugenio Viola writes of Ferrari, \"In a time when many continue to lament what they see as the inexorable decline of theory’s role in criticism, “Arte essenziale” (Essential Art), curated by philosopher Federico Ferrari, does its part to placate concerns with an exploration of the ties that link artistic practice and philosophical speculation. The show focuses on the Wesen, or essence, of a work of art—a notion that has always been inextricably linked with a search for the new.\"\n\n\n"}

When twelve years of age, at that time \nfatherless, he was placed under John Varley, with whom he worked altogether five years, a friend having paid a premium of £200. Among his earliest patrons was Lord Northwick, a patron of the fine arts, who employed FInch in making views of his mansion and grounds. Some time after leaving his master's studio the same friend who had assisted in \nplacing him there afforded him the benefit of a tour through Scotland.\n\nAfter his return he doubted for some time whether he should continue the practice of landscape or enter as a student at the Royal Academy. He joined Sass's life academy and produced several \nportraits, but circumstances drawing him back to landscape-painting he became a candidate for admission into the then newly formed Society of Painters in Water Colours. On 11 February 1822 he was elected an \nassociate, and on 4 June 1827 a member of that society. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1817, at that period living at 44 Conduit Street, Bond Street. He married in the spring of 1837, and lived in Charlotte Street for some time, and later in Argyle Square, Euston Road. \n\nHe possessed a fine voice, and was a talented musician, and a poet.

The term derives from its traditional use as durable layers interleaved between sheets of gold stock during the process of making gold leaf by goldbeating, as a batch process producing many \"leaves\" at the same time. In the early modern production of airships, application of its high strength-to-weight ratio and reliability were crucial for building at least the largest examples.\n\nTo manufacture goldbeater's skin, the gut of oxen (or other cattle) is soaked in a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide, washed, stretched, beaten flat and thin, and treated chemically to prevent putrefaction. A pack of 1,000 pieces of goldbeater's skin requires the gut of about 400 oxen and is thick.\n\nUp to 120 sheets of gold laminated with goldbeater's skin can be beaten at the same time, since the skin is thin and elastic and does not tear under heavy goldbeating. The resultant thickness of gold leaf can be as small as 1 μm-thick.\n\nGoldbeater's skin is used as the sensitive element in hygrometers, since its hygroscopic behavior includes contraction or expansion in response to atmospheric humidity.\nAlexander Graham Bell used a drum of goldbeater's skin with an armature of magnetised iron attached to its middle as a sound receiver (\"see Invention of the telephone\").\nThe North German Confederation printed 10- and 30-groschen postage stamps on goldbeater's skin to prevent reuse of these high-value stamps. \nJoseph Thomas Clover invented an apparatus for measuring the inhalation of chloroform in 1862; it included a large reservoir bag, lined with goldbeater's skin to make it airtight, into which a known volume of liquid chloroform was injected, while its contraction or expansion was monitored.\n\nDue to its transparency, strength, and fairly uniform thickness, goldbeater's skin is also used to repair holes and tears in manuscripts written on vellum.\nLarge quantities of goldbeater's skin were used to make the gas bags of early balloons created by the Royal Engineers at Chatham, Kent starting in 1881–82 culminating in 1883 with \"The Heron\", of 10,000 cu ft capacity. The method of preparing and making gas-tight joins in the skins was known only to a family from Alsatia called Weinling who were employed by the RE for many years. The British had a monopoly on the technique until around 1912 when the Germans adopted the material for the internal gas bags of the \"Zeppelin\" rigid airships, exhausting the available supply: about 200,000 sheets were used for a typical World War I Zeppelin, while the USS \"Shenandoah\" needed 750,000 sheets. The sheets were joined together and folded into impermeable layers.\nGoldbeater's skin (sometimes also called \"fish skin\" in this context) is sometimes also used to seal oboe reeds to prevent them from leaking air.\nThe goldbeater's skin test is used to assess the tanning properties of a compound.\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, goldbeater's skin was also used as a material for condoms..\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33543260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33543260", "title": "Historical criticism", "text": "Historical criticism\n\nHistorical criticism, also known as the historical-critical method or higher criticism, is a branch of criticism that investigates the origins of ancient texts in order to understand \"the world behind the text\". While often discussed in terms of Jewish and Christian writings from ancient times, historical criticism has also been applied to other religious writings from various parts of the world and periods of history.\nThe primary goal of historical criticism is to discover the text's primitive or original meaning in its original historical context and its literal sense or \"sensus literalis historicus\". The secondary goal seeks to establish a reconstruction of the historical situation of the author and recipients of the text. That may be accomplished by reconstructing the true nature of the events that the text describes. An ancient text may also serve as a document, record or source for reconstructing the ancient past, which may also serve as a chief interest to the historical critic. In regard to Semitic biblical interpretation, the historical critic would be able to interpret the literature of Israel as well as the history of Israel.\nIn 18th century Biblical criticism, the term \"higher criticism\" was commonly used in mainstream scholarship in contrast with \"lower criticism\". In the 21st century, historical criticism is the more commonly used term for higher criticism, and textual criticism is more common than the loose expression \"lower criticism\".\n\nHistorical criticism began in the 17th century and gained popular recognition in the 19th and 20th centuries. The perspective of the early historical critic was rooted in Protestant Reformation ideology since its approach to biblical studies was free from the influence of traditional interpretation. Where historical investigation was unavailable, historical criticism rested on philosophical and theological interpretation. With each passing century, historical criticism became refined into various methodologies used today: source criticism, form criticism, redaction criticism, tradition criticism, canonical criticism, and related methodologies.\n\nHistorical-critical methods are the specific procedures used to examine the text's historical origins, such as/the time, the place in which the text was written; its sources; and the events, dates, persons, places, things, and customs that are mentioned or implied in the text.\n\nApplication of the historical critical method, in biblical studies, investigates the books of the Hebrew Bible as well as the New Testament. Historical critics compare texts to other texts written around the same time. An example is that modern biblical scholarship has attempted to understand the Book of Revelation in its 1st century historical context by identifying its literary genre with Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature.\n\nIn regard to the Gospels, higher criticism deals with the synoptic problem, the relations among Matthew, Mark, and Luke. In some cases, such as with several Pauline epistles, higher criticism can confirm the traditional understanding of authorship. Higher criticism understands the New Testament texts within a historical context: that is, that they are not adamantine but writings that express the \"traditio\" (what is handed down). The truth lies in the historical context.\n\nIn classical studies, the 19th century approach to higher criticism set aside \"efforts to fill ancient religion with direct meaning and relevance and devoted itself instead to the critical collection and chronological ordering of the source material.\" Thus, higher criticism, whether biblical, classical, Byzantine or medieval, focuses on the source documents to determine who wrote it and where and when it was written.\n\nHistorical criticism has also been applied to other religious writings from Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism and Islam.\n\nHistorical criticism comprises several disciplines, including source criticism, form criticism, redaction criticism, tradition criticism, and radical criticism.\n\nSource criticism is the search for the original sources which lie behind a given biblical text. It can be traced back to the 17th century French priest Richard Simon, and its most influential product is undoubtably Julius Wellhausen's \"Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels\" (1878), whose \"insight and clarity of expression have left their mark indelibly on modern biblical studies.\"\nForm criticism breaks the Bible down into sections (\"pericopes\", stories), which are analyzed and categorized by genres (prose or verse, letters, laws, court archives, war hymns, poems of lament etc.). The form critic then theorizes on the pericope's \"Sitz im Leben\" (\"setting in life\"), the setting in which it was composed and, especially, used. Tradition history is a specific aspect of form criticism, which aims at tracing the way in which the pericopes entered the larger units of the biblical canon, especially the way in which they made the transition from oral to written form. The belief in the priority, stability and even detectability, of oral traditions is now recognised to be so deeply questionable as to render tradition history largely useless, but form criticism itself continues to develop as a viable methodology in biblical studies.\n\nRedaction criticism studies \"the collection, arrangement, editing and modification of sources\" and is frequently used to reconstruct the community and purposes of the authors of the text.\n\nPioneers of historical criticism as applied to the Bible include the Dutch scholars Desiderius Erasmus (1466? – 1536) and Benedict Spinoza (1632–1677).\nWhen it is applied to the Bible, the historical-critical method is distinct from the traditional, devotional approach. In particular, while devotional readers concern themselves with the overall message of the Bible, historians examine the distinct messages of each book in the Bible. Guided by the devotional approach, for example, Christians often combine accounts from different gospels into single accounts, but historians attempt to discern what is unique about each gospel, including how they differ.\n\nThe phrase \"higher criticism\" became popular in Europe from the mid-18th century to the early 20th century to describe the work of such scholars as Jean Astruc (1684-1766), Johann Salomo Semler (1725–91), Johann Gottfried Eichhorn (1752–1827), Ferdinand Christian Baur (1792–1860), and Wellhausen (1844–1918). In academic circles, it now is the body of work properly considered \"higher criticism\", but the phrase is sometimes applied to earlier or later work using similar methods.\n\n\"Higher criticism\" originally referred to the work of German biblical scholars of the Tübingen School. After the groundbreaking work on the New Testament by Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), the next generation, which included scholars such as David Friedrich Strauss (1808–74) and Ludwig Feuerbach (1804–72), analyzed in the mid-19th century the historical records of the Middle East from biblical times, in search of independent confirmation of events in the Bible. The latter scholars built on the tradition of Enlightenment and Rationalist thinkers such as John Locke (1632–1704), David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Gotthold Lessing, Gottlieb Fichte, G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831) and the French rationalists.\n\nSuch ideas influenced thought in England through the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and, in particular, through George Eliot's translations of Strauss's \"The Life of Jesus\" (1846) and Feuerbach's \"The Essence of Christianity\" (1854). In 1860, seven liberal Anglican theologians began the process of incorporating this historical criticism into Christian doctrine in \"Essays and Reviews\", causing a five-year storm of controversy, which completely overshadowed the arguments over Charles Darwin's newly-published \"On the Origin of Species\". Two of the authors were indicted for heresy and lost their jobs by 1862, but in 1864, they had the judgement overturned on appeal. \"La Vie de Jésus\" (1863), the seminal work by a Frenchman, Ernest Renan (1823–1892), continued in the same tradition as Strauss and Feuerbach. In Catholicism, \"L'Evangile et l'Eglise\" (1902), the magnum opus by Alfred Loisy against the \"Essence of Christianity\" of Adolf von Harnack (1851–1930) and \"La Vie de Jesus\" of Renan, gave birth to the modernist crisis (1902–61). Some scholars, such as Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976) have used higher criticism of the Bible to \"demythologize\" it.\n\nJohn Barton argues that the term \"historical-critical method\" conflates two nonidentical distinctions, and prefers the term \"Biblical criticism\":\n\nNot a few observers, especially among religious circles, have criticized the historical-critical method as biased by \"a priori\" reasons:\n\nFrom these two principles the Modernists deduce two laws, which, when united with a third which they have already got from agnosticism, constitute the foundation of historical criticism. We will take an illustration from the Person of Christ. In the person of Christ, they say, science and history encounter nothing that is not human. Therefore, in virtue of the first canon deduced from agnosticism, whatever there is in His history suggestive of the divine, must be rejected. Then, according to the second canon, the historical Person of Christ was transfigured by faith; therefore everything that raises it above historical conditions must be removed. Lately, the third canon, which lays down that the person of Christ has been disfigured by faith, requires that everything should be excluded, deeds and words and all else that is not in keeping with His character, circumstances and education, and with the place and time in which He lived. A strange style of reasoning, truly; but it is Modernist criticism.\nNow we ask here: Who is the author of this history? The historian? The critic? Assuredly, neither of these but the philosopher. From beginning to end everything in it is a priori.\n\n"}

It is located in the Roman city of Pompeii. It, along with the rest of Pompeii was preserved by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius on October A 24, 79 AD.\n\nThe House of Loreius Tiburtinus was excavated between the years 1916 and 1921 by V. Spinazzola. It can be found on the Via Dell'Abbondanza (or street of abundance), one of the most prosperous streets in Pompeii. There is considerable debate over the naming of this particular house. Its original name of Loreius Tiburtinus was derived from electoral advertisements of sorts etched in the outer façade, some saying \"Vote for Loreius\" and others \"Vote for Tiburtinus.\" In fact, the last known owner of the house was a man named Octavius Quartio, whose bronze seal was found inside the house during excavation. Some historians choose to refer to this house as the House of Octavius Quartio.\nPompeii is organized into a series of \"insulae\" or rectangular blocks of buildings made up of a combination of shops and residences. The House of Loreius Tiburtinus occupies almost its entire \"insula\" with a combination of its residential area and its garden. Also included in the \"insula\" were two \"cauponae\" (Inns where locals could receive a hot meal). Its location was convenient to both the palaestra and the amphitheatre, and the section of Via Dell'Abbondanza it occupied was closed off to cart traffic in ancient times.\n\nThe inside of the house is fairly uniform in its organization, and matches the standard of much of the Roman architecture at the time. Unfortunately some of the house's original integrity was compromised before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the earthquake of 62 AD.\n\nThe entryway or anteroom leads into the atrium, a large open room with an \"impluvium\" in the center. This basin collected rainwater through a hole in the roof to be used by the patrons of the house. On the far side of the atrium is a modest peristyle where the original tablinum (office) once was. The lack of a functional tablinum is evidence of the earthquake's toll on the house's infrastructure. There are several oeci off the main atrium used as receiving rooms with various art displayed in each room. In the House of Loreius Tiburtinus, one specific oecus that borders the \"viridarium\" or indoor garden functioned as a \"triclinium\" or dining area where guests could be entertained. This room was particularly well decorated to please the many guests that must have passed through. Bordering the garden is a summer \"triclinium\" where diners could recline during the warmer months.\n\nThe House of Loreius Tiburtinus is particularly well known for its extensive gardens and outdoor ornamentation. Beyond the summer triclinium there was a specific arrangement of two \"Euripi\", a decorative type of fountain. These fountains were the centerpiece for many frescoes and statuettes. The upper \"Epirus\" has a strong significance to the excavated city of Pompeii because its decorative frescoes are the source of the only known artist's signature: \"Lucius pinxit\" or \"Painted by Lucius.\" These frescoes portray the myths of Narcissus on one side of the fountain and Pyramus and Thisbe on the other. The other lower Euripus is a fountain that spans the long garden which holds numerous types of foliage including various fruit trees. All of these fountains operate using a technology called castellum plumbeum, a fairly complex water pressure system which functioned with the local water towers, providing to several locations.\n\n"}

She is the half-sister of Denise Fox (Diane Parish), and aunt to Chelsea Fox (Tiana Benjamin) and Libby Fox (Belinda Owusu). She first appeared as a guest character on 24 November 2009, and was reintroduced in 2010 as a regular character after piquing the interest of new executive producer Bryan Kirkwood. Empson took maternity leave in October 2013 and after appearing several times during her break via webcam, Kim returned to Albert Square on 30 December 2014.\n\nKim is described as \"viscous and bubbly\" on the outside, but hiding vulnerability and low self-esteem. The \"EastEnders\" website describes Kim as having big hair, a loud personality, hyperactive and a big heart. She is sharp, family-orientated and cares about her appearance, having a loud dress sense and being the life and soul of any party. She chooses the wrong men to have relationships with, but knows what she wants when it comes to love. Kim makes her first appearance for Denise's wedding to Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet). She briefly returns after Denise is presumed dead, but makes a more permanent return when she separates from her boyfriend Dexter Mulholland (Robbie Gee). Kim kisses Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen), sparking a brief feud with his wife, Bianca (Patsy Palmer). She establishes a short-lived speakeasy and later opens a bed and breakfast. Kim also goes through a HIV scare and has a relationship with Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn). Kim gave birth to a baby girl, Pearl, prematurely during \"EastEnders\" Live Week, which celebrated \"EastEnders\"' 30th anniversary. In a later storyline, Kim suffered a miscarriage.\n\nKim is often shown in a comedic light and as a result, Empson earned a nomination for \"Best Comedy Performance\" at the 2011 British Soap Awards. That same year she won the \"Funniest Performance\" award at the \"Inside Soap Awards\" and again the following year. Ruth Deller from entertainment website Lowculture praised the character during her guest appearance in 2009 and later said Kim is a \"big, ballsy, whirlwind\", who provides some light relief to the show. Daniel Maier from \"The Guardian\" has criticised Kim's B&B venture, calling it a \"holding pen for characters who are 'between homes' within Albert Square's hermetically sealed biosphere.\"\n\nKim visits Walford to attend the wedding of her sister, Denise. She is disappointed by her plans for a low-key hen night, so organises a livelier event. During her visit, Kim's partner, Dexter Mulholland (Robbie Gee), makes a pass at her niece, Chelsea, but she chooses to forgive him. She makes a repeat visit seven months later and reveals that she has broken up with Dexter, as he was unfaithful to her. The following month, Kim is told that Denise has committed suicide. She returns to Walford for the funeral, as does her sister, Daphne (Emi Wokoma). It later transpires that Denise is still alive, as her death was staged by her husband, Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet). Kim comes to stay with her, having once more separated from Dexter. She begins working at the local beauty salon and establishes a short-lived speakeasy. Kim causes trouble by kissing her married neighbour, Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). His wife, Bianca (Patsy Palmer), finds out and is initially furious, but she and Kim forge a bond and become friends. Despite earlier conflict over her speakeasy, Kim also becomes friends with Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace), landlady of the local pub. When Dexter buys Kim out of their restaurant business, she purchases the house next door to Denise's and opens a bed and breakfast, called \"Kimberley's Palace\". It becomes her sole source of income when she is fired from the beauty salon for her lax attitude to work. Walford's new GP, Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti), makes a long term booking at the B&B. Kim is initially attracted to him, but refrains from pursuing him as Denise is also interested in him. She accidentally tells Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) that Denise and Yusef haven't had sex yet which Masood uses to his advantage by telling Denise. Denise is at first annoyed with Kim for telling people about her private life, but they later reconcile. The next day, Kim helps out at Tommy Moon's christening.\n\nKim wakes up in a skip and after initially lets Patrick and Denise believe she may have been attacked. However, Patrick find CCTV footage of a drunken Kim entering the local shop, the Minute Mart, late at night and taking alcohol. Kim explains to Denise that her erratic behaviour is due to a former boyfriend telling her that he has contracted HIV. Denise persuades Kim to take a HIV test which comes back negative, leaving Kim relieved. After Yusef sets the B&B on fire, Kim, Patrick and Denise are left homeless, so they move in with Anthony (Matt Lapinskas) and Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline) and borrow clothes from friends. Kim starts spending money, thinking that insurance will cover the damage, but Patrick tells her that he was holding illegal alcohol and fireworks in the B&B, which made the fire worse, and the insurance may not pay out. Kim is angry and says she no longer wants to live with Patrick, but Denise later convinces Kim that her material possessions are not what matters and they should be a family. After the insurance company refuse to pay for the damage, Patrick decides to retire and offers Kim and Denise the Minute Mart. Kim arranges a blind date, and on her way to it, is saved by Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn) from a falling ladder. She is attracted to him, and later when he sees she has been stood up, he offers to get her another drink. However, she is disappointed to learn that he has two children, saying she is fed up of men with \"baggage\". She then tries to chat up Gethin Williams (Bradley Freegard), but he harshly rejects her.\n\nShe turns her attention back to Ray after seeing him running and tells him she has started an fitness venture called \"Kimba\". She enlists some people to come to the class but Ray does not come. Ray asks Kim out but she says she has a date, and then meets Sinclair (Colin Michael Carmichael) from the Internet. Sinclair makes inappropriate comments about Kim's race. Ray calls Kim easy so she slaps him, and she then slaps Sinclair for his comments. When Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia) inherits all of Yusef's money, she gives it to Kim and Denise but is unhappy when they start spending it frivolously. Kim and Ray eventually reconcile and they share a kiss, although Kim continues to play hard to get, pretending she does not like him. Kim dislikes it when she sees Ray and Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) playfight in the kitchen. She also becomes jealous when she overhears him flirting with Bianca whilst helping in the kitchen. As a result, she accidentally slices off the top of Ray's finger when he tries to help her fillet some fish. She accompanies him to the hospital where they open up to one another and decide to start a relationship. Ray is upset when his son, Morgan (Devon Higgs) moves away. To cheer him up, Kim organises an intimate evening for them, however Ray arrives with his daughter, Sasha (Rebecca Sanneh). Kim is shocked and tells Ray that, although she is interested in him, she does not think she can take on his children. Denise convinces Kim that she needs to accept Sasha and arranges for Kim to look after her. It goes well and she promises to do it again.\n\nMeanwhile, a man from the local council tells Kim that the new name for the B&B, Kim's Olympic Palace, infringes copyright. The next day, Kim is disappointed as the B&B's sign is taken down. Kim and Sasha start to bond and Kim and Ray declare their love for one another. When the B&B opens, Denise is annoyed by Kim's apaethetic approach to running the place and quits. Kim struggles to run the B&B by herself and they later reconcile. When playing basketball with Sasha and Morgan, Kim smashes a window in the charity shop. Sasha takes the blame and works there, but she is unhappy, so Kim says she will organise some work experience for Sasha with a forensic scientist. Kim later admits this was a lie, leading to Ray moving out. Kim then gets Sasha a placement with Les Coker's (Roger Sloman) firm of funeral directors, and Ray and Kim make up. Kim discovers that Ray has been looking for flats locally and she assumes that Ray is looking for somewhere for them both to live. However, she is left upset and humiliated when Ray reveals that the flat is actually for Sasha's mother, Deanne, so that they can both be closer to Sasha. Ray affirms his love for her and they reconcile. A few months later, Ray kisses Denise, and when Kim finds out, Ray says Denise initiated it. Kim slaps Denise and disowns her, however they soon reconcile. Ray ends his relationship with Kim, who is devastated and blames Denise, saying she does not want to see her again. Kim and Denise reconcile again when Ray admits he kissed Denise. A few months later Kim and Ray resume their relationship. Ray learns that Deanne has been in an accident and so decides to move to Essex to be closer to Sasha. Kim agrees to move with him, but at her birthday party she realises they do not have much in common and decides to stay, saying a tearful goodbye to him. Kim departs to work on a cruise ship, and during her time away, she marries Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood).\n\nKim returns to Walford after splitting from Vincent and reveals to Denise that she is pregnant. Kim struggles with caring for Patrick, who has suffered a stroke. Kim goes into labour early and gives birth to a girl, Pearl. She briefly falls out with Denise when she insults Kim's failed marriage, and leaves a voicemail and a text message for Vincent, informing him that he is a father. She regrets this afterwards and confides in Kat, Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Patrick that after the cruise, she visited Vincent to tell him she was pregnant but discovered he was a criminal when she saw him covered in blood and fled. Pearl develops an infection and is ill in hospital for several months, and when she brings her daughter home, Kim finds Vincent waiting for her. He explains that he was helping the victim of a mugging when she saw him, and although she is still suspicious, she reunites with him. She provides him with a false alibi for the assault on a drug dealer and key witness at Dot Branning's (June Brown) trial, and later discovers from his foster sister Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) that he did this for Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), a former girlfriend of his. She confronts Ronnie thinking she is having an affair with Vincent, but they explain they are no longer together, although Kim tells Ronnie to stay away from Vincent. Vincent cons Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) into giving him his wife, Sharon Mitchell's (Letitia Dean) bar, the Albert. Sharon reinvests in the bar and Kim competes with Sharon to manage it. Vincent surprises Kim with news that he has bought them a house, but Denise tells Kim that he is just sweetening her up and Patrick throws him out of the house. Vincent tries to win Kim back by saying the new house is for Pearl. Kim decides to move on from Vincent but soon changes her mind and they kiss. Kim and Vincent's mother Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) then realise that Vincent has invited them both to live with him without telling them. When Claudette accuses Kim of freeloading, Kim decides to sell her share of her house, where Denise and Patrick live, which leaves them with a smaller home.\n\nKim is shocked to discover Vincent has taken delivery of a large amount of drugs, but he tells her that it is so he can set up Phil by planting them in his house as revenge for his father, Eric, killing Vincent's father, Henry. Vincent tells Kim how this happened, and Claudette confirms it, but convinces Kim not to tell anyone. When Phil deliberately scares Kim, Kim and Sharon attempt to end the feud and with Ronnie's help, Phil and Vincent agree. However, Phil later kidnaps Pearl from the house, and Vincent refuses to call the police, instead revealing he has a gun and will end it his own way. However, it soon emerges that Claudette killed Henry, not Eric, and Kim is reunited with Pearl.\n\nKim and Claudette clash at Pearl's first birthday party, and when Claudette's foster son Linford Short (Leon Lopez) announces that she is a finalist in the Pride of Walford Awards, Kim tries to take the attention away by jumping on Pearl's bouncy castle, which Claudette then punctures; Denise tells Kim that Claudette did this deliberately. Kim is horrified when Donna decides she wants Vincent to be a sperm donor so she can have a baby, but Vincent convinces her it is the right thing to do, however, it does not work and Donna changes her mind. When Kim finds out that Denise is pregnant but wants the baby adopted, Kim decides she and Vincent should adopt the child, but Denise is against this. Vincent discovers that Kim has received a parking fine in his car for parking in a bus lane; she discovers that Donna has a disabled parking permit so Kim uses Claudette as a way into Donna's flat and steals the permit to go shopping. Vincent discovers this and tells Donna, who tells her it is wrong; Patrick reveals Kim has never passed her driving test so Vincent bans her from driving his car. Vincent then gives Kim driving lessons, but she is angry that people are taking bets on whether she will pass or fail her test. She also worries when Denise does not want to tell her daughters that she is pregnant; Kim tells Libby, prompting her return to Walford. She passes her driving test but breaks her arm, so she is annoyed that she is unable to drive. Kim and Vincent travel to Montserrat and Denise is upset to learn that Kim has told their mother, Emerald Fox (Doña Croll), that Denise is pregnant. Denise gives birth to a boy, but Kim becomes angry when she discovers that Denise still plans to have her son adopted and tries to reason with her. Denise refuses to change her mind, so Kim brands her a \"cold-hearted bitch\". Vincent comforts Kim but advises her to accept and respect Denise's decision otherwise she would lose her sister, however, Kim stands by her own decision and decides to cut all ties with Denise. When Denise survives a bus crash, Denise rejects Kim's support. Kim throws Emerald a farewell dinner and invites Denise but Emerald and Patrick suspect that she has planned it for the same time as Denise's class to make her look bad. Kim embarrasses Denise by interrupting her class and revealing that Denise abandoned her son. An angry but defiant Denise eventually goes to the dinner but confronts Kim, telling her that she realises that Kim still sees Denise as a mother and fears being abandoned by her. At Emerald's leaving party, Kim and Denise stand up for each other against Emerald when she criticises Kim's parenting, and when Kim says she is thankful for her sister, Emerald says they are not really sisters, explaining that Denise was brought to her as a baby. This causes Kim and Denise to reunite. After learning that Denise's friends know the identity of her son's biological father, Kim decides to find out the truth herself, concluding that Denise's former fiancé Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is the father. Kim confronts Ian but his wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) informs her that he has had a vasectomy so cannot father any more children. Denise eventually tells Kim that Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) is the father, which shocks Kim; Denise begs her not to tell anyone. When Kush suffers a cardiac arrest, Kim assists Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), who performs CPR. Kim is interviewed by a local radio station and plans to use the opportunity to advertise The Albert, but changes her mind after seeing Ian, who has lost his son and business in a fire.\n\nKim thinks she has food poisoning but later finds out she is being sick because she is pregnant. She tells Vincent but he refuses to show interest of the idea of having another child, which hurts and confuses Kim, but they later are both excited by this. However, Kim suffers a miscarriage, which devastates her. She continues to pretend she is pregnant and tries to get pregnant but this fails and she eventually tells Denise and Carmel the truth. Kim suspects Vincent is cheating on her but he is selling the Albert, which he has been forced to do by Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin). Aidan buys it from Vincent for £1, and Kim discovers that she and Vincent risk losing their home due to Vincent's loss of income. Vincent decides to return to his police informant days, offering information on the heist in return for cash. However, Phil discovers Vincent is talking to the police and has a corrupt officer threaten Vincent. Vincent disappears and Kim is forced to move in with Denise and get a job at the local shop.\n\nKim was referenced multiple times following Denise's arrival in \"EastEnders\". She initially appeared as a guest character, along with her boyfriend Dexter, between 24 and 27 November 2009. In December 2009, executive producer Diederick Santer was asked by entertainment website \"Digital Spy\" if there were plans for Kim and Dexter to return. He said, \"There's nothing currently storylined for Kim and Dexter, but they really caught my eye. I know they've caught [future executive producer] Bryan [Kirkwood]'s eye, too, because we were only talking about them recently. They work brilliantly with the rest of the family. I hope that if the actors are up for it and if me or Bryan find the right moment, we'll see them again.\" Kim was subsequently brought back as a regular character by Kirkwood in 2010, on which he said, \"I'm a huge fan of Tameka. She is a real talent and will bring a fresh, funny and exciting new flavour to the show.\" Empson said \"I'm really thrilled and excited to be returning to \"EastEnders\". I've always loved the show and working with such fantastic actors makes the whole experience even sweeter. Kim Fox is such a great character to play and gives me scope to do things I usually wouldn't get away with.\" Kim's return was aired on 27 July 2010. Empson also believes that she is different from Kim, commenting : \"I don't know if I am, you know! In a way yes, and no. She's bolder than myself. She can go on all night – I need a break in between dancing and stuff! I like good shoes, comfortable shoes. But it all works [for Kim], from the toes right the way up.\" Empson managed to win the 'Funniest Female' award at the 2012 Inside Soap Awards.\n\nWith the announcement of Kim's permanent return to Albert Square, the character was described as \"viscous and bubbly\" on the outside, but hiding vulnerability and low self-esteem by Kris Green of Digital Spy. The \"EastEnders\" website describes Kim as having \"big hair\", a \"loud personality\" and a big heart to match.\" It continues to read: \"With dress sense louder than Bianca Jackson's brood and an unsuitable boyfriend in toe, you will definitely know when Kim Fox enters the building! With her big hair and loud personality she is always the life and soul of the party. Kim's appearance is important to her, but she's not concerned about labels – for her it is 'upkeep on the cheap'. She might look like a long in the tooth ghetto princess, but scratch beneath the surface and you will find a sharp, family-orientated person with a big heart.\" Kim has also been described as \"feisty\".\n\nWhile speaking to the Press Association, Empson said she felt good about bringing humour to \"EastEnders\" through her character. The actress explained \"I think people want to smile, people want to have a laugh and I love Kim. You get so much theatre with Kim. I'm not actually like her but I love it. I like to party like Kim, but Kim can out-drink me any time.\" Empson said of the character and her style: \"I like to have a good time but Kim's like ten times more full-on than me. Her outfits—I could only dream about wearing her outfits. The tighter the better for Kim! I like a bit of comfort and to be able to breathe. [...] Kim knows no bounds—she feels no shame. Kim's very feminine and she's all about 'the look' and pampering herself.\" Jaci Stephen from the \"Daily Mail\" has described Kim's style as \"bling-on-a-budget\" and said that if her outfits do not turn heads, then her loud voice will always get attention as her voice is \"louder than her taste in clothes\".\n\nSpeaking in July 2010 about the storyline where Denise is discovered to be alive, Empson told \"Digital Spy\" that finding out was \"crazy\" for Kim, but said that \"It's the start of a new direction for Kim and Denise, though.\" Speaking about Kim's relationship with Denise, Empson said that they are \"chalk and cheese—and the macaroni's yet to be made. You'll start to see—even more than you can now—that Denise and Kim are very different. You'll start to wonder how they can be sisters! They're Foxes by blood, though. They'll watch each other's backs but at the same time, they'll tear each other down. They won't let anyone else tear the other down, though—that's their job!\"\n\nIn September 2010, Empson teased that Kim would stir things up with her kiss with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen): \"Well put it this way, all the men are in my eyesight. [...] I don't think anybody is safe from Kim.\"\n\nEmpson revealed in December 2011 that both Kim and Denise will stand up to Phil Mitchell after they receive incriminating evidence about him on Christmas Day. They are both shocked when they find a USB stick which contains a recording of Phil confessing the role he had in Kevin's death. Speaking to \"Inside Soap\", Empson commented: \"When all the information about Kevin Wicks and Phil blows up, it comes out of nowhere for the Fox girls. Kevin's death was way before Kim's time, so she's bewildered by the whole thing. They wonder why someone would tell them about such a thing on Christmas Day. Kim knows no fear. It might be Phil, but she's not afraid to take him on. The Mitchells think that they're the big guns in the Square – but as far as Kim's concerned, the Fox family are the same. They might not have the same numbers as the Mitchells, but they won't shy away from a fight.\" Empson added that she gets on much better with McFadden when not filming. She commented: \"He's such a great actor because he's not like his character Phil at all. He's so lovely.\"\n\nThe B&B (also called The B&B – Kim's Palace) is a mock–documentary focussing on Kim and her life running her bed and breakfast. There have been four episodes, plus one video featuring outtakes. Empson wrote the entire series, which was produced by Matt Taylor. Kim's sister Denise features in two of the episodes, and Lorna Sinclair plays a B&B guest in the third episode. The official synopsis says: \"A camera crew is given access to all areas of 'Kim's Palace'. The team focus on her adventures (and mishaps) as she strives to raise her small business from the ashes of disaster, catapulting her into the realm of the Alan Sugars and Richard Bransons of this world. With Kim at the helm, surely nothing can go wrong. Can it?! Watch this space...\" Empson revealed in an interview with Digital Spy that she came up with the idea for the spin-off when she was on set thinking that the B&B should be used more, and more people should be seen staying there, but as most regular characters have their own homes, Empson though of a \"behind-the-scenes\" look at the B&B. Bryan Kirkwood was \"EastEnders\" executive producer at the time, and Empson had heard the B&B would be burnt down, but she was reassured that it would be refurbished. Lorraine Newman took over from Kirkwood and agreed to Empson's idea. Empson worked with the \"EastEnders\" web team to create the series, and they wanted it to be shorter than she did, so her scripts were edited but all her jokes were kept. Empson said of the series: \"It's still \"EastEnders\", but at the same time it's going to be its own show. It's a standalone thing and Kim is showing how to run a successful business. She thinks that she's a bit like Hilary Devey, but she would give Hilary Devey a run for her money! It's a bit of \"Dragons' Den\", a bit of \"The Apprentice\" and \"The Hotel Inspector\" all rolled into one.\"\n\nDaniel Maier from \"The Guardian\" criticised Kim's B&B, saying, \"There's been a [...] futile relaunch afoot in \"EastEnders\", in which the B&B has reopened as Kimberley's Palace. Who stays there? Really, though? Tourists? Escaped convicts? Delegates for Whelk 2011, Europe's leading mollusc expo at Walford International Conference Centre? By the look of it, the place is actually a holding pen for characters who are \"between homes\" within Albert Square's hermetically sealed biosphere.\n\nRuth Deller from Lowculture praised Kim on her guest appearance in 2009 saying, \"Denise Johnson's sister, Kim, has only been in the show five minutes and has already stolen the limelight big style. Tameka [Empson] is a joy in everything she appears in and she was the only thing that made those terrible wedding episodes worth watching. A new Aunt Sal type recurring character, perhaps? She's a much more interesting prospect than yet another new Mitchell/Branning/Slater/etc, though I'd fear for her if she was made a permanent fixture and had to complete the obligatory Phil Mitchell shagging initiation ritual. Some people are just too good for all that nonsense\". Deller later praised Kim when she had returned saying, \"It's widely acknowledged that \"EastEnders\" can't do comedy very well, but that's only because it tries to do comedy the way \"Coronation Street\" or \"Neighbours\" do, which just won't wash in Britain's most miserable postcode. What it can do is provide characters who offer some light relief to the show, whilst still functioning (just about) as believable human beings. Kim Fox is one such character—a big, ballsy, whirlwind, she brings a sense of fabulousness to all her scenes and works well as the kind of character that can sympathise with those going through the usual Walford misery whilst encouraging them to embrace their inner fag/hag. Cherish her before she succumbs to the inevitable marriage to Phil/Ian/Max/Whoever.\"\n\nEmpson received a nomination in the \"Best Comedy Performance\" category at the British Soap Awards 2011, for her portrayal of Kim. She later won \"Funniest Performance\" at the 2011 Inside Soap Awards. Of her win, she said \"It feels amazing. All those days in the bedroom practising with the hairbrush, now I've finally got my award and it feels great.\" In October 2011, Empson was nominated for one award, at the Screen Nation Awards which celebrate the best British Black talent. She was nominated for the Favourite Female TV Star. In August 2017, Empson was longlisted for Funniest Female at the Inside Soap Awards. She made the viewer-voted shortlist, but lost out to Dolly-Rose Campbell, who portrays Gemma Winter in \"Coronation Street\".\n\nClaire Crick of \"All About Soap\" said \"Blimey, that Kim Fox is a feisty one isn't she?\" She said that Kim has a good \"right hook\" and said that Kim and Ray should just get together as soon as possible. Lucy Mangan of \"The Guardian\" said that Kim \"walks and talks like an actual warm, funny, normal person\", adding that she \"has dropped into Walford like manna-with-comedy-chops from heaven\". Mangan also said that Kim \"moves across [Albert Square] like a shaft of sunlight, piercing the gloom. She laughs. She cracks jokes. She is warm, funny, vivacious and we must enjoy her while we can. Because eventually the dank, fetid air of Walford will poison her lungs and the cold, clammy hand of 'Enders-doom will lay itself upon her soul and quieten it forever.\" The \"Daily Mail's\" soap critic Jaci Stephen commented that Kim is \"gobby, nagging and sporting a hairdo that looks like a motorway pile-up.\" Stephen added that she has \"never been convinced by Kim\".\n\n"}

This strongly male-dominated culture is cinematographically afraid of a male that contradicts the traditional ideal, leading to a lack of exposure for the transgender male within Latin American queer cinema. While many have attempted to bring the Latino transgender man into queer cinema, such as in Arturo Ripstein’s \"El Lugar sin limites\" (1978), the man is seldom portrayed in a positive light.\nIn queer Latin American cinema, the body is often seen as a tool above all else. The body is a tool that is used in order to attain satisfaction above all other things. There is also a normative ideal in Latin American cinema that it is acceptable for women to sleep in the same bed together, situation such as those do not automatically place a movie within the realm of queer cinema. It is not a social norm, however, for two men to share a bed. Two men sharing a bed within Latin American cinema, even if those men are young, is often used as an indication of queer acts that are not explicitly shown.\n\n\"La Mission\" (2009)\nChe Rivera (Benjamin Bratt) is a newly released prisoner.

Che thought that he brought up his son right by encouraging him to be a better person than Che. However, dynamics change when he finds out that his son is gay. He does not accept it and ends up kicking Jes out of the house. For Che, being gay is losing your machismo within the community and you are viewed as weak.

{"id": "14272511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14272511", "title": "Marine art", "text": "Marine art\n\nMarine art or maritime art is any form of figurative art (that is, painting, drawing, printmaking and sculpture) that portrays or draws its main inspiration from the sea. Maritime painting is a genre that depicts ships and the sea—a genre particularly strong from the 17th to 19th centuries. In practice the term often covers art showing shipping on rivers and estuaries, beach scenes and all art showing boats, without any rigid distinction - for practical reasons subjects that can be drawn or painted from dry land in fact feature strongly in the genre. Strictly speaking \"maritime art\" should always include some element of human seafaring, whereas \"marine art\" would also include pure seascapes with no human element, though this distinction may not be observed in practice.\n\nShips and boats have been included in art from almost the earliest times, but marine art only began to become a distinct genre, with specialized artists, towards the end of the Middle Ages, mostly in the form of the \"ship portrait\" a type of work that is still popular and concentrates on depicting a single vessel. As landscape art emerged during the Renaissance, what might be called the marine landscape became a more important element in works, but pure seascapes were rare until later. Marine painting was a major genre within Dutch Golden Age painting, reflecting the importance of overseas trade and naval power to the Dutch Republic, and saw the first career marine artists, who painted little else. In this, as in much else, specialist and traditional marine painting has largely continued Dutch conventions to the present day. With Romantic art, the sea and the coast was reclaimed from the specialists by many landscape painters, and works including no vessels became common for the first time.\n\nVessels on the water have featured in art from the earliest times. The earliest known works are petroglyphs from 12,000 BCE showing reed boats in the Gobustan Petroglyph Reserve in modern Azerbaijan, which was then on the edge of the much larger Caspian Sea. Rock carvings and carved objects depicting ships have been found on several islands of the Aegean (Andros, Naxos, Syros, Astypalaia, Santorini) as well as mainland Greece (Avlis), dating from 4,000 BCE onwards.\n\nBoth men and gods are shown on river \"barges\" in Ancient Egyptian art; these boats were made of papyrus reed for most uses, but the vessels used by the pharaohs were of costly imported cedar wood, like the 43.6 m (143 ft) long and 5.9 m (19.5 ft) wide Khufu ship of c. 2,500. Nilotic landscapes in fresco in Egyptian tombs often show scenes of hunting birds from boats in the Nile delta, and grave goods include detailed models of boats and their crews for use in the afterlife. The central cult image in Egyptian temples was usually a small figure of the god, carried in a barge or \"barque\". \nShips sometimes appear in Ancient Greek vase painting, especially when relevant in a narrative context, and also on coins and other contexts, though with little attempt at a seascape setting. As in Egyptian painting, the surface of the water may be indicated by a series of parallel wavy lines. Ancient Roman painting, presumably drawing on Greek traditions, very often shows landscape views from the land across a lake or bay with distant land on the horizon, as in the famous \"Ulysses\" paintings in the Vatican Museums. The water is usually calm, and objects that are submerged, or partly so, may be shown through the water. The large Nile mosaic of Palestrina (1st century BCE) is a version of such compositions, with a view intended to show all the course of the river.\n\nFrom Late Antiquity to the end of the Middle Ages marine subjects were shown when required for narrative purposes, but did not form a genre in the West, or in Asian ink painting traditions, where a river with a small boat or two was a standard component of scholar landscapes. Marine highlights in Medieval art include the 11th century Bayeux Tapestry showing the Norman Invasion of England. From the 12th century onwards, seals of ports often featured a \"ship portrait\". The ship functioned as an image of the church, as in Giotto's lost \"Navicella\" above the entrance to Old St Peter's in Rome, but such representations are of relatively little interest from the purely marine point of view.\n\nA distinct tradition begins to re-emerge in Early Netherlandish painting, with two lost miniatures in the Turin-Milan Hours, probably by Jan van Eyck in about 1420, showing a huge leap in the depiction of the sea and its weather. Of the seashore scene called \"The Prayer on the Shore\" (or \"Duke William of Bavaria at the Seashore\", the \"Sovereign's prayer\" etc.) Kenneth Clark says: \"The figures in the foreground are in the chivalric style of the de Limbourgs; but the sea shore beyond them is completely outside the fifteenth-century range of responsiveness, and we see nothing like it again until Jacob van Ruisdael's beach-scenes of the mid-17th century.\" There was also a true seascape, the \"Voyage of St Julian & St Martha\", but both pages were destroyed in a fire in 1904, and only survive in black and white photographs. For the rest of the 15th century illuminated manuscript painting was the main medium of marine painting, and in France and Burgundy in particular many artists became skilled in increasingly realistic depictions of both seas and ships, used in illustrations of wars, romances and court life, as well as religious scenes. Scenes of small pleasure boats on rivers sometimes feature in the calendar miniatures from books of hours by artists such as Simon Bening.\n\nDuring the Gothic period the nef, a large piece of goldsmith's work in the shape of a ship, used for holding cutlery, salt or spices, became popular among the grand. Initially just consisting of the \"hull\", from the 15th century the most elaborate had masts, sails and even crew. As the exotic nautilus shell began to reach Europe, many used these for their hull, like the Burghley Nef of about 1528. Lower down the social scale, interest in shipping was reflected in many early prints of ships. The earliest are by Master W with the Key, who produced several engravings of ships; for some time such \"ship portraits\" were confined to prints and drawings, and typically showed the ship with no crew, even if under sail. They also usually anticipated the low horizon that painting would not achieve until the 17th century. The first print of a naval battle is an enormous (548 x 800 mm) woodcut of the Battle of Zonchio in 1499 between the Venetians and the Turks. The only surviving impression is coloured with stencils; most were probably pasted onto walls. The earliest comparable painting to survive comes from several decades later.\n\nAt the same time artists were often involved in the expansion of Western cartography, and more aware than might always seem evident of the scientific and nautical advances of the age. According to Margarita Russell, one of Erhard Reuwich's woodcuts from the first printed travel book (1486) shows him trying to demonstrate his understanding of the curvature of the earth with a ship half-seen on the horizon. The many coastal views in the book's woodcuts are important in the development of such representations. Birds-eye plans of cities, often coastal, which we would today usually consider as cartography, were often done by artists, and considered as much as works of art as maps by contemporaries.\n\nItalian Renaissance art showed maritime scenes when required, but apart from the Venetian artist Vittore Carpaccio there were few artists in this or the next century who often returned to such scenes, or did so with special sensitivity. Carpaccio's scenes show Venetian canals or docksides; there are several arrivals and departures in his \"Legend of Saint Ursula\". In the German-speaking lands, Konrad Witz's \"Miraculous Draught of Fishes\" (1444) is both the first landscape painting to show a recognisable rural location, and an atmospheric view across Lake Geneva.\n\nThe Netherlandish tradition of the \"world landscape\", a panoramic view from a very high viewpoint, pioneered by Joachim Patinir in the 1520s, once again begins to include a wide expanse of water in a rather similar way to the classical paintings, which these artists cannot have been aware of. These paintings were essentially landscapes in the guise of history paintings, with small figures usually representing a religious subject. A strong marine element was therefore present as landscape painting began to emerge as a distinct genre. The Protestant Reformation greatly restricted the uses of religious art, accelerating to the development of other secular types of art in Protestant countries, including landscape art and secular forms of history painting, which could both form part of marine art. \nAn important work by a Flemish \"follower of Patenir\" is the \"Portuguese Carracks off a Rocky Coast\" of about 1540 (787 x 1447 mm), in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London, \"which has justly been labelled the earliest known pure marine painting\". This probably represents the meeting of two small fleets involved in escorting a Portuguese princess going to be married; a type of ceremonial maritime subject which remained very common in court art until the late 17th century, although more often set at the point of embarkation or arrival. Another example is the painting in the Royal Collection showing Henry VIII embarking for the Field of the Cloth of Gold, which is typical in clearly showing the ships side-on, with no attempt to adjust for the high view point. A superb coloured drawing by Hans Holbein the Younger of a ship crowded with drunken lansquenets was perhaps done in preparation for a mural in London. This adopts the low viewpoint typical of the ship portrait.\nPieter Bruegel the Elder is famous for his development of genre painting scenes of peasant life, but also painted a number of marine subjects, including Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (c. 1568); the original is now recognised as lost, and the painting in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels is now seen as a good early copy of Bruegel's original. He also painted a large \"\", of 1560, Galleria Doria-Pamphilj, Rome, and a small but dramatic late shipwreck scene. A larger storm scene in Vienna, once regarded as his, is now attributed to Joos de Momper. Such subjects were taken up by his successors, including his sons. \nThe highly picturesque and historically useful Anthony Roll was a luxury illuminated manuscript inventory of the ships of the Royal Navy prepared for Henry VIII in the 1540s. However it is neither very visually accurate nor artistically accomplished, having perhaps been illustrated by the official concerned. As in France, 16th-century English paintings of elaborate royal embarkations and similar occasions are formulaic, if often impressive. Most used Netherlandish artists, as did representations in prints of the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. The Virgin of the Navigators is a Spanish work of the 1530s with a group of ships at anchor, presumably in the New World, protected by the Virgin.\n\nMannerism in both Italy and the North began to paint fantastic tempests with gigantic waves and lightning-filled skies, which had not been attempted before but were to return into fashion at intervals over the following centuries. As naval warfare became more prominent from the late 16th century, there was an increased demand for works depicting it, which were to remain a staple of maritime painting until the 20th century, pulling the genre in the direction of history painting, with an emphasis on the correct and detailed depiction of the vessels, just as other trends pulled in the direction of increasingly illusionist and subtle effects in the treatment of the sea and weather, paralleling those of landscape painting. Many artists could paint both sorts of subject, but others specialized in one or the other. However at this date seascapes showing a large portion of sea and with no vessels at all were very rare.\n\nThe Dutch Republic relied on fishing and trade by sea for its exceptional wealth, had naval wars with Britain and other nations during the period, and was criss-crossed by rivers and canals. By 1650 95% of ships passing from the North Sea into the Baltic were Dutch. Pictures of sea battles told the stories of a Dutch navy at the peak of its glory, though today it is usually the \"calms\", or more tranquil scenes that are highly estimated. It is therefore no surprise that the genre of maritime painting was enormously popular in Dutch Golden Age painting, and taken to new heights in the period by Dutch artists. As with landscapes, the move from the artificial elevated view typical of earlier marine painting to a low viewpoint was a crucial step, made by the first great Dutch marine specialist Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom.\n\nMore often than not, even small ships fly the Dutch tricolour, and many vessels can be identified as naval or one of the many other government ships. Many pictures included some land, with a beach or harbour viewpoint, or a view across an estuary. Other artists specialized in river scenes, from the small pictures of Salomon van Ruysdael with little boats and reed-banks to the large Italianate landscapes of Aelbert Cuyp, where the sun is usually setting over a wide river. The genre naturally shares much with landscape painting, and in developing the depiction of the sky the two went together; many landscape artists also painted beach and river scenes. Artists probably often had precise models of ships available to help them achieve accurate depictions. Artists included Jan Porcellis, Simon de Vlieger, Jan van de Cappelle, and Hendrick Dubbels. \nThe prolific workshop of Willem van de Velde the Elder and his son was the leader of the later decades, tending, as at the beginning of the century, to make the ship the subject, but incorporating the advances of the tonal works of earlier decades where the emphasis had been on the sea and the weather. The Younger van de Velde was very strongly influenced by Simon de Vlieger, whose pupil he was. The Elder van de Velde had first visited England in the 1660s, but both father and son left Holland permanently for London in 1672, leaving the master of heavy seas, the German-born Ludolf Bakhuizen, as the leading artist in Amsterdam. Reinier Nooms, who had been a sailor and signed his works \"Zeeman\" (\"seaman\"), specialized in highly accurate battle scenes and ship portraits, with some interest also in effects of light and weather, and it was his style that was to be followed by many later specialized artists. Abraham Storck and Jan Abrahamsz Beerstraaten were other battle specialists. Nooms also painted several scenes of dockyard maintenance and repair operations, which are unusual and of historical interest.\n\nThe tradition of marine painting continued in the Flemish part of the Netherlands, but was much less prominent, and took longer to shake off the Mannerist style of shipwrecks amid fantastic waves. Most paintings were small \"zeekens\", whereas the Dutch painted both large and small works. The leading artist was Bonaventura Peeters. \nThe Dutch style was exported to other nations by various artists who emigrated, as well as mere emulation by foreign artists. The most important emigrants were the leading Amsterdam marine artists, the father and son Willem van de Velde. Having spent decades chronicling Dutch naval victories over the English, after the collapse of the art market in the disastrous rampjaar of 1672, they accepted an invitation from the English court to move to London, and spent the rest of their lives painting the wars from the other side. Artists loosely said to have \"followed\" their style include Isaac Sailmaker, although he was a much earlier Dutch emigrant who had preceded their arrival in England by at least 20 years, and whose style is very different from theirs; as well as Peter Monamy, whose style derives from numerous marine painters besides the van de Veldes, such as Nooms, Peeters and Bakhuizen; and several others, such as Thomas Baston and the Vale brothers, who painted in the native English tradition.\n\nIncreasingly, marine art was already mostly left to specialists, with rare exceptions like Rembrandt's powerful \"The Storm on the Sea of Galilee\" of 1633, his only true seascape. Van Dyck made some fine drawings of the English coast from boats off Rye, apparently when waiting for his ship to the continent, but never produced any paintings. Some of Rubens's paintings involve the sea and ships, but are so extravagant and stylised that they can hardly be called marine art. However Claude Lorrain developed an influential type of harbour scene, usually with a view out to a sea with a rising or setting sun, and extravagant classical buildings rising on both sides of the channel. This elaborated on a tradition of Italianate harbour scenes by Northern artists (Italian ones took little interest in such scenes) that goes back at least as far as Paul Bril and was especially popular in Flanders, with Bonaventura Peeters and Hendrik van Minderhout, an emigrant from Rotterdam, as the leading exponents there, and Jan Baptist Weenix in the Republic.\n\nThe century supplied an abundance of military actions to depict, and before the Annus Mirabilis of 1759 the English and French had roughly equal numbers of victories to celebrate. There were a considerable number of very accomplished specialist artists in several countries, who continued to develop the Dutch style of the previous century, sometimes in a rather formulaic manner, with carefully accurate depictions of ships. This was insisted on for the many paintings commissioned by captains, ship-owners and others with nautical knowledge, and many of the artists had nautical experience themselves. For example, Nicholas Pocock had risen to be master of a merchantman, learning to draw while at sea, and as official marine painter to the king was present at a major sea battle, the Glorious First of June in 1794, on board the frigate HMS \"Pegasus\". Thomas Buttersworth had served as a seaman in several actions up to 1800. The Frenchman Ambroise Louis Garneray, mainly active as a painter in the following century, was an experienced sailor, and the accuracy of his paintings of whaling is praised by the narrator in Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\", who knew them only from prints. At the bottom end of the market, ports in many European countries by now had \"pierhead artists\" at the docks, who would paint cheap ship portraits that were typically fairly accurate as to the features and rigging of the ship, which was demanded by sailor customers, but very formulaic in general artistic terms.\n\nThe Venetian artists Canaletto and Francesco Guardi painted vedute in which the canals, gondolas and other small craft, and lagoon of Venice are most often prominent features; many of Guardi's later works barely show land at all, and Canaletto's works from his period in England also mostly feature a river and boats. Both produced a large quantity of work, not all of the same quality, but their best paintings handle water and light superbly, though in very different moods, as Canaletto's world is always bright and sunny, where Guardi's is often overcast, if not misty and gloomy.\nNaval cadets were now encouraged to learn drawing, as new coastal charts made at sea were expected to be accompanied by \"coastal profiles\", or sketches of the land behind, and artists were appointed to teach the subject at naval schools, including John Thomas Serres, who published \"Liber Nauticus, and Instructor in the Art of Marine Drawings\" in 1805/06. Professional artists were now often sent on voyages of exploration, like William Hodges (1744–1797) on James Cook's second voyage to the Pacific Ocean, and exotic coastal scenes were popular as both paintings and prints.\n\nPrints had become as significant as a source of income as the original painting for some artists, for example the much-engraved French painter Claude Joseph Vernet (1714–1789), who both revived something of the spirit of the Mannerist tempest, and looked forward to Romanticism, in his large and extremely dramatic scenes of storms and shipwrecks. He was also commissioned by the French government to produce a series of views of French harbours, with the strange result that many of his works showing merchant shipping are very violent, and most showing naval vessels very tranquil. He also developed a type of large Claudeian harbour-scene, at sunset and with a generalized Mediterranean setting, which were imitated by many artists. Another early Romantic French, or at least Alsatian-Swiss, artist was Philip James de Loutherbourg (1740–1812), who spent most of his career in England, where he was commissioned by the government to produce a number of works depicting naval victories. Watson and the Shark is a famous marine history subject of 1778 by John Singleton Copley.\n\nThe Romantic period saw marine painting rejoin the mainstream of art, although many specialized painters continued to develop the \"ship portrait\" genre. Antoine Roux and sons dominated maritime art in Marseille throughout the 1800s with detailed portraits of ships and maritime life. \nArguably the greatest icon of Romanticism in art is Théodore Géricault's \"The Raft of the Medusa\" (1819), and for J.M.W. Turner painting the sea was a lifelong obsession. The \"Medusa\" is a radical type of history painting, while Turner's works, even when given history subjects, are essentially approached as landscapes. His public commission The Battle of Trafalgar (1824) was criticised for inaccuracy, and his most personal late works make no attempt at accurate detail, often having lengthy titles to explain what might otherwise seem an unreadable mass of \"soapsuds and whitewash\", as The Athenaeum described Turner's \"\" of 1842.\n\nThe new force in painting, the art of Denmark, featured coastal scenes very strongly, with an emphasis on tranquil waters and still, golden light. These influenced the German Caspar David Friedrich, who added an element of Romantic mysticism, as in \"The Stages of Life\" (1835); his \"The Sea of Ice\" is less typical, showing a polar shipwreck. Ivan Aivazovsky continued the old themes of battles, shipwrecks and storms with a full-blooded Russian Romanticism, as in The Ninth Wave (1850).\nRiver, harbour and coastal scenes, typically with only small boats, were popular with Corot and the Barbizon school, especially Charles-François Daubigny; many of the most famous works of the most important Russian landscapist, Isaac Levitan, featured tranquil lakes and also the huge rivers of Russia, which he and many artists treated as a source of national pride. Gustave Courbet painted a number of scenes of beaches with cliffs and views looking out to sea of waves breaking on a beach, usually with no human figures or craft. During the 1860s Édouard Manet painted a number of paintings depicting important and newsworthy events including his 1864 'marine' painting of the \"Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama,\" memorializing a sea battle that took place in 1864 during the Civil War in the United States.\nThe ship portrait genre was taken to America by a number of emigrants, most English like James E. Buttersworth (1817–1894) and Robert Salmon. The Luminist Fitz Henry Lane (1804–1865) was the earliest of a number of artists who developed American styles based in landscape art; he painted small boats at rest in tranquil small bays. Martin Johnson Heade was a member of the Hudson River School, and painted tranquil scenes, but also threatening storms of alarming blackness. Winslow Homer increasingly specialized in marine scenes with small boats towards the end of the century, often showing boats in heavy swells on the open sea, as in his \"The Gulf Stream\".Thomas Eakins often painted river scenes, including \"Max Schmitt in a Single Scull\" (1871).\n\nThomas Goldsworthy Dutton (1820-1891) has the reputation of being one of the finest lithographers of 19th Century nautical scenes and ship portraits.\n\nLater in the century, as the coast became increasingly regarded as a place of pleasure rather than work, beach scenes and coastal landscapes without any shipping became prominent for the first time, often including cliffs and rock formations, which had earlier been mostly found in scenes of shipwreck. Many later beach scenes became increasingly crowded, as holidaymakers took over the beaches of Europe. Eugène Boudin's scenes of the beaches of north France strike a familiar note to the modern viewer, despite the heavy clothing worn by the ladies sitting on chairs in the sand. The Impressionists painted many scenes of beaches, cliffs and rivers, especially Claude Monet, who often returned to Courbet's themes, as in \"Stormy Sea in Étretat\". It was his \"Impression, Sunrise\" (1872), a view over the waters of the harbour at Le Havre, that had given the movement its name. River scenes were very common among the Impressionists, especially by Monet and Alfred Sisley.\n\nThe Spanish painter Joaquín Sorolla painted many beach scenes, typically concentrating on a few figures seen close up, in contrast to the smaller figures of most beach paintings. American artists who painted beaches and shores, typically less populated, include John Frederick Kensett, William Merritt Chase, Jonas Lie, and James Abbott McNeill Whistler, who mainly painted rivers and the canals of Venice. Towards the end of the 19th century the American painter Albert Pinkham Ryder created moody and darkly visionary early modernist seascapes. The Fauve and Pointilliste groups included fairly tranquil waters in large numbers of their work, as did Edvard Munch in his early paintings. In England the Newlyn School and the naive fisherman-artist Alfred Wallis are worth noting.\n\nThe rather traditional British marine artist Sir Norman Wilkinson was during World War I the inventor of dazzle camouflage, by which ships were boldly painted in patterns, achieving results not dissimilar to Vorticism, inspiring the naval ditty: \"Captain Schmidt at the periscope / You need not fall or faint / For it’s not the vision of drug or dope / But only the dazzle paint\". When the American navy adopted the idea in 1918, Frederick Judd Waugh was put in charge of design.\n\nSpecialized marine painters concentrating on ship portraits continue to the present day, with artists such as Montague Dawson (1895–1973), whose works were very popular in reproduction; like many, he found works showing traditional sailing ships more in demand than those of modern vessels. Even in 1838 Turner's \"The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up\", still probably his most famous work, displayed nostalgia for the age of sail. Marine subjects still attract many mainstream artists, and more popular forms of marine art remain enormously popular, as shown by the parodic series of paintings by Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid called \"America's Most Wanted Painting\", with variants for several countries, almost all featuring a lakeside view.\n\nAs noted above, a river with a small boat or two was a standard component of Chinese ink and brush paintings, and many featured lakes and, less often, coastal views. However the water was often left as white space, with the emphasis firmly on the land elements in the scene. The more realist court school of Chinese painting often included careful depictions of the shipping on China's great rivers in the large horizontal scrolls showing panoramas of city scenes with the Emperors progressing across the Empire, or festivals like the one shown above.\n\nThe turning-away from long-distance maritime activity of both the Chinese and Japanese governments at the time of the Western Renaissance no doubt helped to inhibit the development of marine themes in the art of these countries, but the more popular Japanese ukiyo-e coloured woodblock prints very often featured coastal and river scenes with shipping, including \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\" (1832) by Hokusai, the most famous of all ukiyo-e images.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1348989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1348989", "title": "Numbers (TV series)", "text": "Numbers (TV series)\n\nNumbers (stylized as NUMB3RS) is an American crime drama television series that ran on CBS from January 23, 2005, to March 12, 2010. The series was created by Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, and follows FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) and his brother Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), a college mathematics professor and prodigy who helps Don solve crimes for the FBI. Brothers Ridley and Tony Scott produced \"Numbers\"; its production companies are the Scott brothers' Scott Free Productions and CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Network Television, and later CBS Paramount Network Television).\n\nThe show focuses equally on the relationships among Don Eppes, his brother Charlie Eppes, and their father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), and on the brothers' efforts to fight crime, normally in Los Angeles. A typical episode begins with a crime, which is subsequently investigated by a team of FBI agents led by Don and mathematically modeled by Charlie, with the help of Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol) and Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat). The insights provided by Charlie's mathematics were always in some way crucial to solving the crime.\n\nOn May 18, 2010, CBS announced that \"Numbers\" had been canceled after six seasons.\n\nThe show revolved around three intersecting groups of characters: the FBI, scientists at the fictitious California Institute of Science (CalSci), and the Eppes family.\n\n\nTemporary characters on the show were often named after famous mathematicians. For example, in the episode \"In Plain Sight\" (season 2, episode 8), one of the criminals is named Rolle and Charlie's father mentions a meeting with a man named Robert Peterson.\n\nOpening: (Voice-over by David Krumholtz) We all use math every day. To predict weather…to tell time…to handle money. Math is more than formulas and equations. It’s logic; it’s rationality. It’s using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.\n\nThe first season run of the show aired between January 23, 2005, and May 13, 2005, at 10:00 p.m. on Fridays. It sees the start of the working relationship between Los Angeles' FBI field office and Charlie Eppes. The main FBI agents are Charlie's brother, Don Eppes, and Terry Lake, as well as David Sinclair. Don and Charlie's father, Alan Eppes, provides emotional support for the pair, while Professor Larry Fleinhardt and doctoral student Amita Ramanujan provide mathematical support and insights to Charlie. Season One was a half-season, producing only 13 episodes. Sabrina Lloyd played Terry Lake, an agent, in this season; she was later replaced by Diane Farr, who played Megan Reeves.\n\nThe second season run of the show aired between September 23, 2005, and May 19, 2006, again at 10:00 p.m. on Fridays. Season Two sees several changes to Don's FBI team: Terry Lake is reassigned to Washington and two new members join Don and David Sinclair: Megan Reeves and Colby Granger. Charlie is challenged on one of his long-standing pieces of mathematical work and also starts work on a new theory, Cognitive Emergence Theory. Larry sells his home and assumes a nomadic lifestyle, while he becomes romantically involved with Megan. Amita receives an offer for an assistant professor position at Harvard University, but is plagued by doubt as her relationship with Charlie is challenged and her career is in upheaval. Alan begins work and dating again, although he struggles with the loss of his wife, and both he and Charlie dream of her.\n\n\"Numb3rs\" was renewed for a third season, which began airing at 10:00 p.m. on Friday, September 22, 2006, and ended on May 18, 2007. Charlie and Amita intensify their relationship, as do Larry and Megan, especially after Megan's kidnapping. Amita has troubles adjusting in her new role as a CalSci professor, and Larry announces his leave of absence—he will be on the International Space Station for six months, which greatly distresses Charlie. Charlie and his colleagues are troubled by Dr. Mildred Finch, the newly appointed Chair of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, whom they learn has begun dating Alan. Meanwhile, Don dates Agent Liz Warner and questions his ethics and self-worth, and receives counseling. Charlie sees Don's therapist and the two understand one another more. Despite Don's concerns, Alan engages in some FBI consulting with his knowledge of engineering, and Larry returns from the space station, disillusioned. The finale wraps up with a revelation that Colby was actually a double agent for the Chinese.\n\nNoticeable changes from previous seasons include the removal of the opening credit sequence (credits are now done during the first segment of the show), the absence of Peter MacNicol's character for much of the season, and the absence of Diane Farr's character for a few episodes. Peter MacNicol appeared in the first eleven episodes before leaving for the television show \"24\", but returned to \"Numbers\" for the 21st episode of season 3 (\"The Art of Reckoning\"). His character's absence was written into the show by having him become a Payload Specialist on the International Space Station. Diane Farr, pregnant for most of the season, left the show for maternity leave in episode 18 (\"Democracy\"); her character's absence is explained as a special assignment to the Department of Justice.\n\nThe season premiere aired on September 28, 2007, in the same time slot as in previous seasons, 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Because of the writer's strike, only 12 episodes were initially produced. However, once the strike ended, CBS announced the show's return April 4, 2008, with six episodes. The season ended on May 16, 2008.\n\nAs this season starts, Colby Granger escapes from jail, and is revealed to be a triple agent. He then rejoins the team. Don and Liz break up halfway through this season, after Liz has trouble with Don's trust issues. Amita's parents come to visit, which becomes a secondary theme throughout most of the season. Due to her work at the D.O.J., Megan is conflicted by her work, and turns to Larry for help. Near the end of the season, Don's girlfriend from season 2, Robin Brooks, returns. Don and Robin then continue their relationship. Charlie attends FBI training camp because he has been working with Don for several years and wants to better understand what his brother does. In the season finale, Megan leaves the team to move back to Washington, D.C., and Charlie goes head-to-head with Don about a case. This causes Charlie to send information to scientists in Pakistan. He is subsequently arrested and has his security clearance revoked, so he can no longer help Don on cases. At the end of the episode, Don drives away to another case and Charlie admits that giving up FBI work will be harder than he expected.\n\nSeveral characters from previous seasons did not appear in season 4, most notably Mildred Finch and Ian Edgerton.\n\nThe fifth season premiered on October 3, 2008, and the season finale aired on May 15, 2009. The season premiere was moved back one week to accommodate the 2008 presidential debates.\n\nSeason five opens three weeks after \"When Worlds Collide\" (season four's season finale), with the government dropping the charges against Charlie. Charlie gets his security clearance back after he and Don fight FBI Security Officer Carl McGowan. Don begins to explore Judaism. The team adds new agent Nikki Betancourt, who arrives shortly after Megan Reeves' departure. Robin is offered a promotion but turns it down. Buck Winters (from the episodes, \"Spree\" and \"Two Daughters\") breaks out of prison and comes after Don. Alan suddenly finds himself coaching CalSci's basketball team. David becomes Don's primary relief supervisor. DARPA tries to recruit Charlie, but he turns down their offer. Toward the end of the season, Don is stabbed, and Charlie blames himself for it. The aftermath of Don's stabbing causes Charlie to focus more on his FBI consultation work. Amita is kidnapped, and the team races to find her. After she is rescued, Charlie proposes to Amita. Her response is left unidentified.\n\nNotes about Season Five:\n\"Disturbed\" marked the 100th episode of \"Numbers\".\n\nThe sixth and final season premiered Friday, September 25, 2009, at 10:00 p.m. EDT and the season finale aired on March 12, 2010, 3 days before Hirsch's 75th birthday.\n\nThe season starts with the engagement of Charlie and Amita. Soon after, Larry turns down an opportunity to meet with mathematicians at CERN, in Geneva, and drops his course load for the following semester. This leads Charlie to realize Larry is once again leaving, and leaving all of his work to Charlie. Don learns that his former mentor is crooked, causing Don angst when he has to shoot his mentor. Charlie and Don learn that Alan has lost a substantial amount of money in his 401(k). After some delay, Larry leaves Los Angeles, only to find a vacant piece of land for sale within driving distance of the city. Alan decides to return to work and finds a job as a software technical consultant. David asks Don for advice about career paths within the FBI.

Also, the show's stunt coordinator, Jim Vickers, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination in 2006 for episode 14 of Season 2, \"Harvest\".\n\nSeveral mathematicians work as consultants for each episode. Actual mathematics is presented in the show; the equations on the chalkboards are mathematically valid, and are somewhat applicable to the situations presented in each show. This mathematical validity and applicability of the equations has been asserted by professional mathematicians.\n\nA book entitled \"The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics\" (; published August 28, 2007), written by Keith Devlin and Dr. Gary Lorden, a consultant to the show along with Dr. Orara, a physics consultant, explain some of the mathematical techniques that have been used both in actual FBI cases and in other law enforcement departments.\n\nSince the premiere season, the blog edited by Prof. Mark Bridger (Northeastern University) has commented on the mathematics behind each episode of the show.\n\nWolfram Research (the developers of \"Mathematica\") is the chief math consultant, reviewing scripts and providing background mathematics for the show. Starting with season four, their website in collaboration with CBS is entitled \"The math behind \"NUMB3RS\"\".\n\nOne part-time mathematician consultant to the show has expressed concern with its use of mathematics, asserting that the math is inserted after the initial script and written to provide plausible sounding jargon, rather than having consultants involved at all stages of story development. The same part-time consultant offered criticism of the show's portrayal of female mathematicians and expressed concern over the appropriateness of the relationship between Charlie Eppes and his graduate student Amita Ramanujan.\n\nThe idea for \"Numbers\" was generated in the late 1990s when Nick Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, attended a lecture given by Bill Nye, a popular science educator. The premise of the show is similar to that of author Colin Bruce's reimaginings of the Sherlock Holmes character, and to the \"Mathnet\" segment on the children's television show \"Square One\".\n\nGabriel Macht was originally cast to portray the character of Don Eppes. Also, the original concept for the show had the events take place at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; this was later changed to the fictional California Institute of Science, commonly called CalSci. Scenes which take place at CalSci are filmed at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the University of Southern California. One of the most frequent campus locations at Caltech is the vicinity of , including the bridge over Millikan Pond, the Trustees room, and the arcades of nearby buildings. At USC, locations include Doheny Library and the Town and Gown dining room. Exteriors for the FBI offices are on the distinctive bridge at Los Angeles Center Studios.\n\nAnother common location is the Craftsman home of the Eppes family. The house shown in the first season is real; it is owned by David Raposa and Edward Trosper, although a replica set was used from the second season onwards.\n\nThe show uses the number three in its title instead of the letter \"e\". In interviews with Tom Jicha of the \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\" and with Alan Pergament of \"The Buffalo News\", Heuton mentioned that the use of the number three in the title derives from leet, a form of computer jargon that replaces letters with numbers. Dr. Gary Lorden, a California Institute of Technology mathematics professor who served as the show's mathematics consultant, told NPR's Ira Flatow that it was created on a normal computer keyboard. Lorden also mentioned that the use of the number three in the title can serve as a restriction in Internet searches about the series.\n\nBoth entertainment reporters and psychologists noticed the title's spelling. Some reporters, such as Joanne Ostrow of the \"Denver Post\", the staff members of \"People Magazine\", the editors of The Futon Critic, the staff of the Scripps Howard News Service, and Mike Hughes of \"USA Today\" acknowledged the presence of the number three in the title. Lynette Rice of \"Entertainment Weekly\" asked Krumholtz about the three in the title; his response was, \"Isn't that annoying? I think it should be the mathematical symbol for sigma, which looks like an E. I've been fighting that for weeks.\" (The sigma (∑) stands for summation.) Others used varying adjectives to describe the title. The TV site Zap2it.com called it \"their typographical silliness, not ours\". Brad Aspey of \"The Muskegon Chronicle\", stated, \"No, that wasn’t an ugly typo you just read - “NUMB3ERS” (pronounced numbers) is the idiosyncratic title of filmmakers Ridley and Tony Scott’s astute and crafty psychological drama which shows that even math can make for edge-of-your-seat entertainment.\" Ellen Gray of \"The Philadelphia Daily News\", said, \"Some of you may have noticed that in promoting \"Numb3rs,\" which premieres Sunday before moving to its regular 10 p.m. Friday slot, CBS has chosen to put a 3 in place of the \"e\" in the title….I won't be going along with this particular affectation, which slows down my typing and seems to be the graphic equivalent of the reversed \"R\" in Toys R Us. So there.\"\n\nStill others had a more positive view of the title. When NPR's Flatow asked both Lorden and Dr. Keith Devlin, NPR's mathematics reporter, about the title, both men denied creating the title; Devlin believed that executive producer Tony Scott originated the title. Lorden stated that he initially thought that the title was \"kind of hokey\" but later saw it as \"brilliant\" and a \"catchy logo\". Jonathan Storm of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", in his review of the series stated, \"You'd think CBS's new Numbers, which premieres at 10 tonight after the Patriots-Steelers football game, is just another one of those shows with numskull titles trying to draw attention to themselves. But the \"3\" substituting for the \"e\" is actually based on a real thing\"…. He later said that the show was \"written by people familiar with the Dead Cow Cult\". David Brooks of \"The Telegraph (Nashua, NH)\" devoted the majority of his entire review to the use of leet in the series title. In addition, three psychologists, Manuel Perea, Jon Andoni Duñabeitia, and Manuel Carreiras mentioned the television series in their 2008 article for the American Psychological Association's \"\".\n\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of \"Numb3rs\" on CBS.\n\n\"Note: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\"\n\n"}

She is the daughter of Marina L. and Donald Maxwell \"Don\" Segall (1933–1994), who was a television comedy writer-producer, and author of comic books and science fiction pulp novels. Her father produced \"The Dave Garroway Show,\" which became \"AM New York,\" and then \"The Today Show.\" He was a page at NBC with Gil Cates, and wrote erotic fiction under various pseudonyms, including Troy Conway. Adlon's father was from Boston, Massachusetts, and her mother is English. Her father was born to a Jewish family, and her mother, originally an Episcopalian, converted to Judaism. Adlon has said that her parents met at the USO in Paris.\n\nAs a child, Adlon lived in the Carnegie House building at 100 West 57th Street. She has said that she and her family lived bi-coastally, moving between Los Angeles and New York because her father was a journeyman writer and producer for TV. She started performing at age nine; one of her father's friends had a radio studio, so she would do voice-over work there. While in Los Angeles, she did TV and film acting work. She attended Sarah Lawrence College for a semester. After moving to Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, she shared a house with Anna Gunn.\n\nAdlon said voice-overs saved her career. As successful as her child-actress years had been, she struggled to find parts in her 20s.\n\nAdlon's best known role is playing Bobby Hill on the animated TV show \"King of the Hill\", for which she won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 2002.

{"id": "58992854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58992854", "title": "Rough Waves", "text": "Rough Waves\n\nRough Waves () is a painting by the Japanese artist Ogata Kōrin, on a two-panel \"byōbu\" (folding screen). The work was created , and depicts a swirl of stormy sea waves. It has been in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, since 1926, when it was acquired with financial support from the Fletcher Fund.\n\nThroughout the history of Japanese art, many artists have sought to convey in their works the fleeting state of rolling sea waves. The theme has been depicted not only on \"emakimono\" (handscrolls) and silk, but also on fans, \"byōbu\" and decor items.\n\nOgata's painting \"Rough Waves\" is the most important image of the unapproachable sea elements to be created in Japanese painting before Hokusai's \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\". To create it, Ogata used an ancient Chinese technique of drawing with two brushes, held together in one hand. \n\nThe materials Ogata used for the painting were ink, paint and gilded paper. He conveyed the threatening and dangerous nature of the waves with the help of elongated and contrastingly contoured, finger- or dragon-claw-like wave crests and sea foam. The expressiveness of the work appears to be unusual for Ogata, with the main means of expression being the use of lines created by ink.\n\nThe screen on which \"Rough Waves\" was painted bears the seal “Dōsū”, a pseudonym that Ogata used from 1704. Recent studies show that Ogata created the painting between 1704 and 1709, during the transitional period in his career when he lived in the city of Edo (now Tokyo). The works of the artist during this period are characterized by a strong influence of the creativity of representatives of the Kanō school.\n\nThe direct source of inspiration for \"Rough Waves\" may have been the work of the artist Sesson Shukei (), whose still-extant paintings include a number of dynamic and mysterious images of sea waves, among them \"Egret, Moon, and Wave\" and \"The Wind and the Waves\". \"Rough Waves\" also reflects the influence of Tawaraya Sōtatsu, who specialized in gloomy landscapes, but is nevertheless an independent interpretation by Ogata of the frightening and violent force of the sea.\n\n\"Rough Waves\" impressed Ogata’s follower Sakai Hōitsu, who in 1805 created his work \"Waves\", in which he tried to convey a similar frightening atmosphere and a premonition of danger. At some time in the past, Hōitsu's family had commissioned work from Ogata, and so a collection of Ogata's pictures was available for Hōitsu to study in detail. The images in \"Waves\", created in ink on silver-plated paper, were more abstract than those in Ogata's work, but retained their demonic character.\n"}
{"id": "104540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=104540", "title": "Salon des Refusés", "text": "Salon des Refusés\n\nThe Salon des Refusés, French for \"exhibition of rejects\" (), is generally an exhibition of works rejected by the jury of the official Paris Salon, but the term is most famously used to refer to the \"Salon des Refusés\" of 1863.\n\nToday by extension, \"salon des refusés\" refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show.\n\nThe Paris Salon, sponsored by the French government and the Academy of Fine Arts, took place annually, and was a showcase of the best academic art. A medal from the Salon was assurance of a successful artistic career; winners were given official commissions by the French government, and were sought after for portraits and private commissions. Since the 18th century, the paintings were classified by genre, following a specific hierarchy; history paintings were ranked first, followed by the portrait, the landscape, the \"genre scene\", and the still life. The jury, headed by the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, the head of the Academy of Fine Arts, was very conservative; near-photographic but idealized realism was expected.\n\nMuch intrigue often went on to get acceptance, and to be given a good place in the galleries. In 1851, Gustave Courbet managed to get one painting into the Salon, \"Enterrement á Ornans\", and in 1852 his \"Baigneuses\" was accepted, scandalizing critics and the public, who expected romanticized nudes in classical settings, but in 1855 the Salon refused all of Courbet's paintings. As early as the 1830s, Paris art galleries mounted small-scale, private exhibitions of works rejected by the Salon jurors. Courbet was obliged to organize his own exhibit, called \"Le Realism\", at a private gallery. Private exhibits attracted far less attention from the press and patrons, and limited the access of the artists to a small public.\n\nIn 1863 the Salon jury refused two thirds of the paintings presented, including the works of Gustave Courbet, Édouard Manet, Camille Pissarro and Johan Jongkind. The rejected artists and their friends protested, and the protests reached Emperor Napoleon III. The Emperor's tastes in art were traditional; he commissioned and bought works by artists such as Alexandre Cabanel and Franz Xaver Winterhalter, but he was also sensitive to public opinion. His office issued a statement: \"Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition. His Majesty, wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints, has decided that the works of art which were refused should be displayed in another part of the Palace of Industry.\"\n\nMore than a thousand visitors a day visited the Salon des Refusés. The journalist Émile Zola reported that visitors pushed to get into the crowded galleries where the refused paintings were hung, and the rooms were full of the laughter of the spectators. Critics and the public ridiculed the \"refusés\", which included such now-famous paintings as Édouard Manet's \"Déjeuner sur l'herbe\" and James McNeill Whistler's \"\". But the critical attention also legitimized the emerging avant-garde in painting.\n\nThe Impressionists successfully exhibited their works outside the traditional Salon beginning in 1874. Subsequent Salons des Refusés were mounted in Paris in 1874, 1875, and 1886, by which time the popularity of the Paris Salon had declined for those who were more interested in Impressionism.\n\nRejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit \"Déjeuner sur l'herbe\" and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés. \"Déjeuner sur l'herbe\" depicts the juxtaposition of a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather in the background, on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. The painting sparked public notoriety and stirred up controversy and has remained controversial, even to this day. Odilon Redon, for example, did not like it. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in Proust's \"Remembrance of Things Past\".\n\nOne interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution in the \"Bois de Boulogne\", a large park at the western outskirts of Paris, at the time. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting. Indeed, the \"Bois de Boulogne\" is to this day known as a pick-up place for prostitutes and illicit sexual activity after dark, just as it had been in the 19th century.\n\nÉmile Zola comments about \"Déjeuner sur l'herbe\":\n\n\"The Luncheon on the Grass\" is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. My God! What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! That has never been seen. And this belief is a gross error, for in the Louvre there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging \"The Luncheon on the Grass\" like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience. Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of \"The Luncheon on the Grass\" is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.\n\nÉmile Zola incorporated a fictionalized account of the 1863 scandal in his novel \"L'Œuvre\" \"(The Masterpiece)\" (1886).\n\nIn 1861, after returning to Paris for a time, James Abbott McNeill Whistler painted his first famous work, \"\". This portrait of his mistress and business manager Joanna Hiffernan was created as a simple study in white; however, others saw it differently. The critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary thought the painting an allegory of a new bride's lost innocence. Others linked it to Wilkie Collins's \"The Woman in White\", a popular novel of the time, or various other literary sources. In England, some considered it a painting in the Pre-Raphaelite manner. In the painting, Hiffernan holds a lily in her left hand and stands upon a bear skin rug (interpreted by some to represent masculinity and lust) with the bear's head staring menacingly at the viewer.\n\nCountering criticism by traditionalists, Whistler's supporters insisted that the painting was \"an apparition with a spiritual content\" and that it epitomized his theory that art should be concerned essentially with the arrangement of colors in harmony, not with a literal portrayal of the natural world.\n\nWhistler started working on \"The White Girl\" shortly after December 3, 1861, with the intention of submitting it to the prestigious annual exhibition of the Royal Academy. In spite of bouts of illness, he finished the painting by April . The portrait was refused for exhibition at the conservative Royal Academy, but in 1863 it was accepted at the Salon des Refusés in Paris, an event sponsored by Emperor Napoleon III for the exhibition of works rejected from the Salon. In a letter to George du Maurier in early 1862 Whistler wrote of the painting:\n\nWhistler submitted the painting to the Academy, but according to Joanna Hiffernan, he expected it to be rejected. The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. Edwin Henry Landseer's \"The Shrew Tamed\" showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert, a noted equestrienne of the period, however it was soon rumored that it was actually Catherine Walters, the notorious London courtesan. Whistler's painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer's that the judges were wary of admitting it. \"White Girl\" was submitted to the Academy along with three etchings, all three of which were accepted, while the painting was not. Whistler exhibited it at the small Berners Street Gallery in London instead. The next year, Whistler tried to have the painting exhibited at the \"Salon\" in Paris – the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts – but it was rejected there as well. Instead, it was accepted at the alternative \"Salon des Refusés\" – the \"exhibition of rejects\" that opened on May 15, two weeks after the official \"Salon\".\n\nAlthough others said while Whistler's painting was widely noticed, he was upstaged by Manet's more shocking painting \"Le déjeuner sur l'herbe\". The controversy surrounding the paintings was described in Émile Zola's novel \"L'Œuvre\" (1886). The reception Whistler's painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris. The painting was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter Gustave Courbet and the poet Charles Baudelaire. The art critic Théophile Thoré-Bürger saw it in the tradition of Goya and Velázquez. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.\n\nArt historian Albert Boime wrote: \"The Salon des Refusés introduced the democratic concept of a multi-style system (much like a multi-party system) subject to the review of the general jury of the public.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18194609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18194609", "title": "Societal views on patents", "text": "Societal views on patents\n\nLegal scholars, economists, activists, policymakers, industries, and trade organizations have held differing views on patents and engaged in contentious debates on the subject. Critical perspectives emerged in the nineteenth century that were especially based on the principles of free trade. Contemporary criticisms have echoed those arguments, claiming that patents block innovation and waste resources that could otherwise be used productively, and also block access to an increasingly important \"commons\" of enabling technologies (a phenomenon called the tragedy of the anticommons), apply a \"one size fits all\" model to industries with differing needs, that is especially unproductive for industries other than chemicals and pharmaceuticals and especially unproductive for the software industry. Enforcement by patent trolls of poor quality patents has led to criticism of the patent office as well as the system itself. Patents on pharmaceuticals have also been a particular focus of criticism, as the high prices they enable puts life-saving drugs out of reach of many people. Alternatives to patents have been proposed, such Joseph Stiglitz's suggestion of providing \"prize money\" (from a \"prize fund\" sponsored by the government) as a substitute for the lost profits associated with abstaining from the monopoly given by a patent.\n\nThese debates are part of a larger discourse on intellectual property protection which also reflects differing perspectives on copyright.\n\nCriticism of patents reached an early peak in Victorian Britain between 1850 and 1880, in a campaign against patenting that expanded to target copyright too and, in the judgment of historian Adrian Johns, \"remains to this day the strongest [campaign] ever undertaken against intellectual property\", coming close to abolishing patents. Its most prominent activists - Isambard Kingdom Brunel, William Robert Grove, William Armstrong and Robert A. MacFie - were inventors and entrepreneurs, and it was also supported by radical laissez-faire economists (The Economist published anti-patent views), law scholars, scientists (who were concerned that patents were obstructing research) and manufacturers. Johns summarizes some of their main arguments as follows:\nSimilar debates took place during that time in other European countries such as France, Prussia, Switzerland and the Netherlands (but not in the USA).\n\nBased on the criticism of patents as state-granted monopolies inconsistent with free trade, the Netherlands abolished patents in 1869 (having established them in 1817), and did not reintroduce them until 1912. In Switzerland, criticism of patents delayed the introduction of patent laws until 1907.\n\nContemporary arguments have focused on ways that patents can slow innovation by: blocking researchers' and companies' access to basic, enabling technology, and particularly following the explosion of patent filings in the 1990s, through the creation of \"patent thickets\"; wasting productive time and resources fending off enforcement of low-quality patents that should not have existed, particularly by \"patent trolls\"; and wasting money on patent litigation. Patents on pharmaceuticals have been a particular focus of criticism, as the high prices they enable puts life-saving drugs out of reach of many people.\n\nThe most general argument against patents is that \"intellectual property\" in all its forms represents an effort to claim something that should not be owned, and harms society by slowing innovation and wasting resources.\n\nLaw professors Michael Heller and Rebecca Sue Eisenberg have described an ongoing tragedy of the anticommons with regard to the proliferation of patents in the field of biotechnology, wherein intellectual property rights have become so fragmented that, effectively, no one can take advantage of them as to do so would require an agreement between the owners of all of the fragments.\n\nSome public campaigns for improving access to medicines and genetically modified food have expressed a concern for \"preventing the over-reach\" of intellectual property protection including patent protection, and \"to retain a public balance in property rights\". Some economists and scientists and law professors have raised concerns that patents retard technical progress and innovation. Others claim that patents have had no effect on research, based on surveys of scientists.\n\nPatents have also been criticized for being granted on already-known inventions, with some complaining in the United States that the USPTO fails \"to do a serious job of examining patents, thus allowing bad patents to slip through the system.\" On the other hand, some argue that because of low number of patents going into litigation, increasing quality of patents at patent prosecution stage increases overall legal costs associated with patents, and that current USPTO policy is a reasonable compromise between full trial on examination stage on one hand, and pure registration without examination, on the other hand.\n\nEnforcement of patents – especially patents perceived as being overly broad – by patent trolls, has brought criticism of the patent system, though some commentators suggest that patent trolls are not bad for the patent system at all but instead realign market participant incentives, make patents more liquid, and clear the patent market.\n\nSome patents granted in Russia have been denounced as pseudoscientific (for example, health-related patents using lunar phase or religious icons).\n\nAccording to James Bessen, the costs of patent litigation exceed their investment value in all industries except chemistry and pharmaceuticals. For example, in the software industry, litigation costs are twice the investment value. Bessen and Meurer also note that software and business model litigation accounts for a disproportionate share (almost 40 percent) of patent litigation cost, and the poor performance of the patent system negatively affects these industries.\n\nRichard Posner noted that the most controversial feature of US patent law is that it covers all industries in the same way, but not all industries benefit from the time-limited monopoly a patent provides in order to spur innovation. He said that while the pharmaceutical industry is \"poster child\" for the need for a twenty-year monopoly, since costs to bring to a market are high, the time of development is often long, and the risks are high, in other industries like software the cost and risk of innovation is much lower and the cycle of innovation is quicker, and obtaining and enforcing patents and defending against patent litigation is generally a waste of resources in those industries.\n\nSome have raised ethical objections specifically with respect to pharmaceutical patents and the high prices for medication that they enable their proprietors to charge, which poor people in the developed world, and developing world, cannot afford. Critics also question the rationale that exclusive patent rights and the resulting high prices are required for pharmaceutical companies to recoup the large investments needed for research and development. One study concluded that marketing expenditures for new drugs often doubled the amount that was allocated for research and development.\n\nIn 2003, World Trade Organization (WTO) reached an agreement, which provides a developing country with options for obtaining needed medications under compulsory licensing or importation of cheaper versions of the drugs, even before patent expiration.\n\nIn 2007 the government of Brazil declared Merck's efavirenz anti-retroviral drug a \"public interest\" medicine, and challenged Merck to negotiate lower prices with the government or have Brazil strip the patent by issuing a compulsory license.\n\nIt is reported that Ghana, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia have similar plans to produce generic antiviral drugs. Western pharmaceutical companies initially responded with legal challenges, but some have now promised to introduce alternative pricing structures for developing countries and NGOs.\n\nIn July 2008 Nobel Prize-winning scientist Sir John Sulston called for an international biomedical treaty to clear up issues over patents.\n\nIn response to these criticisms, one review concluded that less than 5 percent of medicines on the World Health Organization's list of essential drugs are under patent. Also, the pharmaceutical industry has contributed US$2 billion for healthcare in developing countries, providing HIV/AIDS drugs at lower cost or even free of charge in certain countries, and has used differential pricing and parallel imports to provide medication to the poor. Other groups are investigating how social inclusion and equitable distribution of research and development findings can be obtained within the existing intellectual property framework, although these efforts have received less exposure.\n\nQuoting a World Health Organization report, Trevor Jones (director of research and development at the Wellcome Foundation, as of 2006) argued in 2006 that patent monopolies do not create monopoly pricing. He argued that the companies given monopolies \"set prices largely on the willingness/ability to pay, also taking into account the country, disease and regulation\" instead of receiving competition from legalized generics.\n\nAlternatives have been discussed to address the issue of financial incentivization to replace patents. Mostly, they are related to some form of direct or indirect government funding. One example is Joseph Stiglitz's idea of providing \"prize money\" (from a \"prize fund\" sponsored by the government) as a substitute for the lost profits associated with abstaining from the monopoly given by a patent. Another approach is to remove the issue of financing development from the private sphere altogether, and to cover the costs with direct government funding.\n\n"}

She formerly held the records for total spacewalks by a woman (seven) and most spacewalk time for a woman (50 hours, 40 minutes). Williams was assigned to the International Space Station as a member of Expedition 14 and Expedition 15. In 2012, she served as a flight engineer on Expedition 32 and then commander of Expedition 33.\n\nSunita Williams was born in Euclid, Ohio, to Indian American neuroanatomist Deepak Pandya and Slovene American Ursuline Bonnie (Zalokar) Pandya, who reside in Falmouth, Massachusetts. She is the youngest of three children. Her brother Jay Thomas is four years older and her sister Dina Annadj is \nthree years older. Williams' paternal family is from Jhulasan, Mehsana district in Gujarat, India, while her maternal great-grandmother Mary Bohinc (originally Marija Bohinjec), born in Leše, Slovenia, immigrated to America as an eleven-year-old with her mother, 1891 Slovene emigrant Ursula (Strajhar) Bohinac.\n\nWilliams graduated from Needham High School in Needham, Massachusetts, in 1983. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in physical science from the United States Naval Academy in 1987, and a Master of Science degree in Engineering Management from Florida Institute of Technology in 1995.\n\nWilliams was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy in May 1987. After a six-month temporary assignment at the Naval Coastal System Command, she was designated a Basic Diving Officer. She next reported to the Naval Air Training Command, where she was designated a Naval Aviator in July 1989. She received initial H-46 Sea Knight training in Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 3 (HC-3), and was then assigned to Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 8 (HC-8) in Norfolk, Virginia, with which she made overseas deployments to the Mediterranean, Red Sea and the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Shield and Operation Provide Comfort. In September 1992, she was the Officer-in-Charge of an H-46 detachment sent to Miami, Florida, for Hurricane Andrew relief operations aboard . In January 1993, Williams began training at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. She graduated in December, and was assigned to the Rotary Wing Aircraft Test Directorate as an H-46 Project Officer and V-22 chase pilot in the T-2. Later, she was assigned as the squadron Safety Officer and flew test flights in the SH-60B/F, UH-1, AH-1W, SH-2, VH-3, H-46, CH-53, and the H-57. In December 1995, she went back to the Naval Test Pilot School as an instructor in the Rotary Wing Department and as the school's Safety Officer. There she flew the UH-60, OH-6, and the OH-58. She was then assigned to as the Aircraft Handler and the Assistant Air Boss. Williams was deployed on \"Saipan\" in June 1998 when she was selected by NASA for the astronaut program. She has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 aircraft types.\n\nSunita Williams began her Astronaut Candidate training at the Johnson Space Center in August 1998.Following are the space mission undertaken by Sunita Williams\n\nWilliams was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) with STS-116, aboard the Space Shuttle \"Discovery\", on December 9, 2006, to join the Expedition 14 crew. In April 2007, the Russian members of the crew rotated, changing to Expedition .\n\nAfter launching aboard the Shuttle \"Discovery\", Williams arranged to donate her pony tail to Locks of Love. Fellow astronaut Joan Higginbotham cut her hair aboard the International Space Station and the ponytail was brought back to Earth by the STS-116 crew. Williams performed her first extra-vehicular activity on the eighth day of the STS-116 mission. On January 31, February 4, and February 9, 2007, she completed three spacewalks from the ISS with Michael López-Alegría. During one of these walks, a camera became untethered, probably because the attaching device failed, and floated off to space before Williams could react.\n\nOn the third spacewalk, Williams was outside the station for 6 hours and 40 minutes to complete three spacewalks in nine days. She has logged 29 hours and 17 minutes in four spacewalks, eclipsing the record held by Kathryn C. Thornton for most spacewalk time by a woman. On December 18, 2007, during the fourth spacewalk of Expedition 16, Peggy Whitson surpassed Williams, with a cumulative EVA time of 32 hours, 36 minutes. In early March 2007, she received a tube of wasabi in a Progress spacecraft resupply mission in response to her request for more spicy food. When she opened the tube, which was packaged at one atmospheric pressure, the gel-like paste was forced out in the lower pressure of the ISS. In the free-fall environment, the spicy geyser was difficult to contain.\n\nOn April 26, 2007, NASA decided to bring Williams back to Earth on the STS-117 mission aboard \"Atlantis\". She did not break the U.S. single spaceflight record that was recently broken by former crew member Commander Michael López-Alegría, but did break the record for longest single spaceflight by a woman. Williams served as a mission specialist and returned to Earth on June 22, 2007, at the end of the STS-117 mission. Poor weather at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral forced mission managers to skip three landing attempts there over previous 24 hours. They then diverted \"Atlantis\" to Edwards Air Force Base in California, where the shuttle touched down at 3:49 p.m. EDT, returning Williams home after a record 192-day stay in space.\n\nOn April 16, 2007, she ran the first marathon by any person in space. Williams was listed as an entrant for the 2007 Boston Marathon, and completed the distance in four hours and 24 minutes. The other crew members cheered her on and gave her oranges during the race. Williams' sister, Dina Pandya, and fellow astronaut Karen L. Nyberg ran the marathon on Earth, and Williams received updates on their progress from Mission Control. In 2008, Williams participated in the Boston Marathon again, this time on Earth.\n\nWilliams launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on July 15, 2012, as part of Expedition 32/33. Her Russian spacecraft Soyuz TMA-05M docked with the ISS for a four-month stay at the orbiting outpost on July 17, 2012. The docking of the Soyuz occurred at 4:51 GMT as the ISS flew over Kazakhstan at an altitude of 252 miles. The hatchway between the Soyuz spacecraft and the ISS was opened at 7:23 GMT and Williams floated into the ISS to begin her duties as a member of the Expedition 32 crew. She was accompanied on the Soyuz TMA-05M spacecraft by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Aki Hoshide and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko. Williams served as commander of the ISS during her stay onboard ISS Expedition 33, succeeding Gennady Padalka. She became the commander of the International Space Station on September 17, 2012, being only the second woman to achieve the feat. Also in September 2012, she became the first person to do a triathlon in space, which coincided with the Nautica Malibu Triathlon held in Southern California. She used the International Space Station's own treadmill and stationary bike, and for the swimming portion of the race, she used the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) to do weightlifting and resistance exercises that approximate swimming in microgravity. After 'swimming' half a mile (0.8 km), 'biking' 18 miles (29 km), and 'running' 4 miles (6.4 km), Williams finished with a time of one hour, 48 minutes and 33 seconds, as she reported.\n\nShe returned to earth with fellow astronauts Flight Engineers Yuri Malenchenko and Aki Hoshide on November 19, 2012, touching down in the town of Arkalyk, Kazakhstan. Helicopters joined the search-and-recovery crew to assist them, as their capsule parachuted down some from the planned touchdown site due to a procedural delay.\n\n, Williams has made seven spacewalks totaling 50 hours and 40 minutes, putting Williams in No. 9 on the list of most experienced spacewalkers. On August 30, 2012, Williams and JAXA astronaut Hoshide ventured outside the ISS to conduct US EVA-18. They removed and replaced the failing Main Bus Switching Unit-1 (MBSU-1), and installed a thermal cover onto Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA-2).\n\nIn July 2015, NASA announced Williams as one of the first astronauts for U.S. Commercial spaceflights. Subsequently, she has started working with Boeing and SpaceX to train in their commercial crew vehicles, along with other chosen astronauts. In August 2018 she was assigned to the first mission flight, CTS-1, to the International Space Station of the Boeing CST-100 Starliner.\n\nShe was a member of Society of Experimental Test Pilots.\n\nWilliams is married to Michael J. Williams, a Federal police officer in Oregon. The two have been married for more than 20 years, and both flew helicopters in the early days of their careers. She had a pet Jack Russell Terrier named Gorby (deceased) who was featured with her on the \"Dog Whisperer\" television show on the National Geographic Channel on November 12, 2010. In 2012, Williams expressed a desire to adopt a girl from Ahmedabad.\n\nIn September 2007, Williams visited India. She went to the Sabarmati Ashram and her ancestral village Jhulasan in Gujarat. She was awarded the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Vishwa Pratibha Award by the World Gujarati Society, the first person of Indian descent who was not an Indian citizen to be presented the award. On October 4, 2007, Williams spoke at the American Embassy School, and then met Manmohan Singh, the then Prime Minister of India.\n\nIn October 2014, Williams visited Slovenia. During her stay, amongst other things, she paid a visit to the Astronomical Society Vega in Ljubljana.\n\nOn June 7, 2017, The Needham School Committee voted unanimously to name the town's new elementary school the Sunita L. Williams Elementary School.\n\n\n\n"}

Viswanath. Produced by V. Madhusudhan Rao, the film starred Mammootty, Master Manjunath and Raadhika. The film is about an egotistical music teacher envious of the extraordinary talent of his prodigious young disciple. The film was showcased among the Indian panorama section, at the 1992 International Film Festival of India, the Asia Pacific Film Festival, the Moscow Film Festival and the AISFM Film Festival. The film has garnered the Filmfare Award for Best Music Direction and the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer. The film was dubbed into Malayalam as \"Pranavam\".\n\nThe film starts with a shabby old man living as a recluse near a famous temple. When he ventures out into the village, he is beaten by the shepherds who believe that he is a thief. When they hand him over to the police, the officer in charge identifies him as a once-famous musician, Anantha Rama Sharma (Mammooty), hailed as Sangeeta Samrat (Emperor of music), who has been missing for four years. The inspector RadhaKrishna (Achyuth) informs his aunt (Jayanthi), who teaches music in his native village, of this and the past of Anantha Sharma is narrated through flashback.\n\nAnantha Rama Sharma is a widely respected Carnatic singer with a big ego. This is established when he rejects the \"Padma Shri\" bestowed upon him by the Government of India, as he believes that the other awardees are not worthy to be mentioned alongside him.\n\nGangadhar (Master Manjunath) lives in the same village. He rejects the society's norms (taking music classes and going to school) and spends his time sitting by the riverside. The river inspires him to sing many songs in different tunes. His music teacher, also the policeman's aunt, recognizes his talent and tries to nurture it. His school teacher (the music teacher's brother) is also fond of Gangadhar.\n\nGangadhar wants to become a great singer, like Ananta Sharma, and his father (Dharmavarapu Subrahmanyam) encourages him. His day comes when Anantha Sharma is honored in an auditorium. Gangadhar sings a song (\"Aanathi Neeyara\") in honor of Anantha Sharma, which many consider to be much better than any of Anantha Sharma's works. The boy is hailed as a child prodigy by everyone including Anantha Sharma's wife.\n\nAnantha Sharma wants to imprison Gangadhar's talents. So he asks Gangadhar to stay in his house and learn music as one must be well-experienced to sing on stage. Anantha Sharma goes to the extent of copying one of Gangadhar's tunes and singing it on stage to win back his glory. But Gangadhar and Ananta's wife find this out. He now feels guilty and defends himself by saying that he did it as he was afraid this child would destroy his name and fame.\n\nIn this emotional moment, he suffers a heart-attack. To show his gratitude towards his adopted mother, Gangadhar kills himself so that there is no competition for Anantha Sharma. The incident shocks the villagers and they call Anantha Sharma a murderer. To escape their wrath and insults, he runs away and becomes a recluse.\n\nAnanta Sharma is still unconscious while in the police station. When he awakes, he finds himself in the house of Gangadhar's music teacher. The music teacher's husband tells him that they have forgiven him and asks him to return to his house. At his house, he finds his wife giving music classes (an institute named \"Gangadhar Music Academy\") for young children.\n\nHe sits down amongst the children learning the music basics from his wife. The movie ends with a scene when a young girl next to him chides him gently by correcting his way of singing a basic song note.\n"}

It is one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings.\n\nDesigned by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.\n\nThe building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and close by the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nThough its name suggests a single venue, the building comprises multiple performance venues which together host well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2 million people. Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, including three resident companies: Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, more than eight million people visit the site annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year. The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust, an agency of the New South Wales State Government.\n\nOn 28 June 2007, the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site; having been listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate since 1980, the National Trust of Australia register since 1983, the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000, the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003, and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005.\n\nThe facility features a modern expressionist design, with a series of large precast concrete \"shells\", each composed of sections of a sphere of radius, forming the roofs of the structure, set on a monumental podium. The building covers of land and is long and wide at its widest point. It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as below sea level.\n\nAlthough the roof structures are commonly referred to as \"shells\" (as in this article), they are precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs, not shells in a strictly structural sense. Though the shells appear uniformly white from a distance, they actually feature a subtle chevron pattern composed of 1,056,006 tiles in two colours: glossy white and matte cream. The tiles were manufactured by the Swedish company Höganäs AB which generally produced stoneware tiles for the paper-mill industry.\n\nApart from the tile of the shells and the glass curtain walls of the foyer spaces, the building's exterior is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at Tarana. Significant interior surface treatments also include off-form concrete, Australian white birch plywood supplied from Wauchope in northern New South Wales, and brush box glulam.\n\nOf the two larger spaces, the Concert Hall is in the western group of shells, the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the eastern group. The scale of the shells was chosen to reflect the internal height requirements, with low entrance spaces, rising over the seating areas up to the high stage towers. The smaller venues (the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio) are within the podium, beneath the Concert Hall. A smaller group of shells set to the western side of the Monumental Steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant. The podium is surrounded by substantial open public spaces, and the large stone-paved forecourt area with the adjacent monumental steps is regularly used as a performance space.\n\nThe Sydney Opera House includes a number of performance venues:\n\nOther areas (for example the northern and western foyers) are also used for performances on an occasional basis. Venues are also used for conferences, ceremonies and social functions.\n\nThe building also houses a recording studio, cafes, restaurants, bars and retail outlets. Guided tours are available, including a frequent tour of the front-of-house spaces, and a daily backstage tour that takes visitors backstage to see areas normally reserved for performers and crew members.\n\nPlanning began in the late 1940s, when Eugene Goossens, the Director of the NSW State Conservatorium of Music, lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions. The normal venue for such productions, the Sydney Town Hall, was not considered large enough. By 1954, Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of NSW Premier Joseph Cahill, who called for designs for a dedicated opera house. It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site: Cahill had wanted it to be on or near Wynyard Railway Station in the northwest of the CBD.\n\nAn international design competition was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received 233 entries, representing architects from 32 countries. The criteria specified a large hall seating 3,000 and a small hall for 1,200 people, each to be designed for different uses, including full-scale operas, orchestral and choral concerts, mass meetings, lectures, ballet performances, and other presentations.\n\nThe winner, announced in 1957, was Jørn Utzon, a Danish architect. According to legend the Utzon design was rescued by noted Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen from a final cut of 30 \"rejects\". The runner-up was an entry by firm GBQC of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The grand prize was 5,000 Australian pounds. Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project. His office moved to Palm Beach, Sydney in February 1963.\n\nUtzon received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, architecture's highest honour, in 2003. The Pritzker Prize citation read:\nThe Fort Macquarie Tram Depot, occupying the site at the time of these plans, was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959. It was built in three stages: stage I (1959–1963) consisted of building the upper podium; stage II (1963–1967) the construction of the outer shells; stage III (1967–1973) interior design and construction.\n\nStage I commenced on 2 March 1959 with the construction firm Civil & Civic, monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners. The government had pushed for work to begin early, fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. However, Utzon had still not completed the final designs. Major structural issues still remained unresolved. By 23 January 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind, mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared, changes of original contract documents). Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963. The forced early start led to significant later problems, not least of which was the fact that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.\n\nThe shells of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry, but, early in the design process, the \"shells\" were perceived as a series of parabolas supported by precast concrete ribs. However, engineers Ove Arup and Partners were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them. The formwork for using \"in-situ\" concrete would have been prohibitively expensive, and, because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms, the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1963, the design team went through at least 12 iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form (including schemes with parabolas, circular ribs and ellipsoids) before a workable solution was completed. The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in structural analysis, to understand the complex forces to which the shells would be subjected. The computer system was also used in the assembly of the arches. The pins in the arches were surveyed at the end of each day, and the information was entered into the computer so the next arch could be properly placed the following day. In mid-1961, the design team found a solution to the problem: the shells all being created as sections from a sphere. This solution allows arches of varying length to be cast in a common mould, and a number of arch segments of common length to be placed adjacent to one another, to form a spherical section. With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy. It was originally credited to Utzon. Ove Arup's letter to Ashworth, a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, states: \"Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions.\" Peter Jones, the author of Ove Arup's biography, states that \"the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise \"eureka\" moment ... ; the engineers and some of their associates, with equal conviction, recall discussion in both central London and at Ove's house.\"\n\nHe goes on to claim that \"the existing evidence shows that Arup's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells, from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres.\" Yuzo Mikami, a member of the design team, presents an opposite view in his book on the project, \"Utzon's Sphere\". It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.\n\nAs Peter Murray states in \"The Saga of the Sydney Opera House\":\n\nThe design of the roof was tested on scale models in wind tunnels at University of Southampton and later NPL in order to establish the wind-pressure distribution around the roof shape in very high winds, which helped in the design of the roof tiles and their fixtures.\n\nThe shells were constructed by Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd, who were also responsible for construction in Stage III. Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on-site factory and also developed the construction processes. The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units (it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground, instead of being stuck on individually at height). Ove Arup and Partners' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells, which used an innovative adjustable steel-trussed \"erection arch\" to support the different roofs before completion. On 6 April 1962, it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965.\n\nStage III, the interiors, started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963. However, there was a change of government in 1965, and the new Robert Askin government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works. Due to the Ministry's criticism of the project's costs and time, along with their impression of Utzon's designs being impractical, this ultimately led to his resignation in 1966 (see below).\n\nThe cost of the project so far, even in October 1966, was still only $22.9 million, less than a quarter of the final $102 million cost. However, the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant.\n\nThe second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned. His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall, who became largely responsible for the interior design. Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E. H. Farmer as government architect, D. S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd.\n\nFollowing Utzon's resignation, the acoustic advisor, Lothar Cremer, confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC) that Utzon's original acoustic design allowed for only 2000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics. According to Peter Jones, the stage designer, Martin Carr, criticised the \"shape, height and width of the stage, the physical facilities for artists, the location of the dressing rooms, the widths of doors and lifts, and the location of lighting switchboards.\"\n\n\nThe Opera House was formally completed in 1973, having cost $102 million. H.R. \"Sam\" Hoare, the Hornibrook director in charge of the project, provided the following approximations in 1973:\nStage I: podium Civil & Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5m.\nStage II: roof shells M.R. Hornibrook (NSW) Pty Ltd approximately $12.5m.\nStage III: completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5m.\nSeparate contracts: stage equipment, stage lighting and organ $9.0m.\nFees and other costs: $16.5m.\n\nThe original cost and scheduling estimates in 1957 projected a cost of £3,500,000 ($7 million) and completion date of 26 January 1963 (Australia Day). In reality, the project was completed ten years late and 1,357% over budget in real terms.\n\nBefore the Sydney Opera House competition, Jørn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built. Utzon's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking. The Assessors Report of January 1957, stated:\n\nFor the first stage, Utzon worked successfully with the rest of the design team and the client, but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions. They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design. This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.\n\nAfter the 1965 election of the Liberal Party, with Robert Askin becoming Premier of New South Wales, the relationship of client, architect, engineers and contractors became increasingly tense. Askin had been a \"vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office.\" His new Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, was even less sympathetic. Elizabeth Farrelly, an Australian architecture critic, wrote that:\nDifferences ensued. One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender.\n\nUtzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC). However, he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges, Harry Ingham Ashworth. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change.\n\nUtzon's ability was never in doubt, despite questions raised by Davis Hughes, who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer. Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was \"probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects\" and: \"The Opera House could become the world's foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head.\"\nIn October 1965, Utzon gave Hughes a schedule setting out the completion dates of parts of his work for stage III. Utzon was at this time working closely with Ralph Symonds, a manufacturer of plywood based in Sydney and highly regarded by many, despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds's \"knowledge of the design stresses of plywood, was extremely sketchy\" and that the technical advice was \"elementary to say the least and completely useless for our purposes.\" Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup's project engineer Michael Lewis as having \"other agendas\". In any case, Hughes shortly after withheld permission for the construction of plywood prototypes for the interiors, and the relationship between Utzon and the client never recovered. By February 1966, Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees. Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff. The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation, Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes: \"If you don't do it, I resign.\" Hughes replied: \"I accept your resignation. Thank you very much. Goodbye.\"\n\nUtzon left the project on 28 February 1966. He said that Hughes's refusal to pay him any fees and the lack of collaboration caused his resignation and later famously described the situation as \"Malice in Blunderland\". In March 1966, Hughes offered him a subordinate role as \"design architect\" under a panel of executive architects, without any supervisory powers over the House's construction, but Utzon rejected this. Utzon left the country never to return.\n\nFollowing the resignation, there was great controversy about who was in the right and who was in the wrong. \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" initially opined: \"No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon. Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW. One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other.\" On 17 March 1966, the \"Herald\" offered the view that: \"It was not his [Utzon's] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project ... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step ... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along.\"\n\nThe Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture. The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer-aided design to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of Gehry and blobitecture, as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.\n\nIt was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, Steensen Varming, was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over of air per minute, using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.\n\nAfter the resignation of Utzon, the Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, and the Government Architect, Ted Farmer, organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion. The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.\n\nPeter Hall (1931–1995) completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University. Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Hellebæk. Returning to Sydney, Hall worked for the Government Architect, a branch of the NSW Public Works Department. While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings, including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales, which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964.\n\nHall resigned from the Government Architects office in early 1966 to pursue his own practice. When approached to take on the design role, (after at least two prominent Sydney architects had declined), Hall spoke with Utzon by phone before accepting the position. Utzon reportedly told Hall: he (Hall) would not be able to finish the job and the Government would have to invite him back. Hall also sought the advice of others, including architect Don Gazzard who warned him acceptance would be a bad career move as the project would \"never be his own\".\n\nHall agreed to accept the role on the condition there was no possibility of Utzon returning. Even so, his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that no one but Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House. Upon Utzon's dismissal, a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point. A petition was also circulated, including in the Government Architects office. Peter Hall was one of the many who had signed the petition that called for Utzon's reinstatement.\n\nWhen Hall agreed to the design role and was appointed in April 1966, he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. What he found was an enormous amount of work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure. In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall. Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls, their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role. With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.\n\nA former Government Architect, Peter Webber, in his book \"Peter Hall: the Phantom of the Opera House\", concludes: when Utzon resigned no one was better qualified (than Hall) to rise to the challenge of completing the design of the Opera House.\n\nThe Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, on 20 October 1973. A large crowd attended. Utzon was not invited to the ceremony, nor was his name mentioned. The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9.\n\nDuring the construction phase, lunchtime performances were often arranged for the workers, with American vocalist Paul Robeson the first artist to perform, in 1960.\n\nVarious performances were presented prior to the official opening:\n\nAfter the opening:\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Sydney Opera House Trust resumed communication with Utzon in an attempt to effect a reconciliation and to secure his involvement in future changes to the building. In 1999, he was appointed by the Trust as a design consultant for future work.\nIn 2004, the first interior space rebuilt to an Utzon design was opened, and renamed \"The Utzon Room\" in his honour. It contains an original Utzon tapestry (14.00 x 3.70 metres) called \"Homage to Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach\". In April 2007, he proposed a major reconstruction of the Opera Theatre, as it was then known. Utzon died on 29 November 2008.\n\nA state memorial service, attended by Utzon's son Jan and daughter Lin, celebrating his creative genius, was held in the Concert Hall on 25 March 2009 featuring performances, readings and recollections from prominent figures in the Australian performing arts scene.\n\nRefurbished Western Foyer and Accessibility improvements were commissioned on 17 November 2009, the largest building project completed since Utzon was re-engaged in 1999. Designed by Utzon and his son Jan, the project provided improved ticketing, toilet and cloaking facilities. New escalators and a public lift enabled enhanced access for the disabled and families with prams. The prominent paralympian athlete Louise Sauvage was announced as the building's \"accessibility ambassador\" to advise on further improvements to aid people with disabilities.\n\nOn 29 March 2016, an original 1959 tapestry by Le Corbusier (2.18 x 3.55 metres), commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called \"Les Dés Sont Jetés\" (The Dice Are Cast), was finally unveiled \"in situ\" after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years. The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015. It now hangs in the building's Western Foyer and is accessible to the public.\n\nIn the second half of 2017, the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works. The Concert Hall is scheduled for work in 2020-2021.\n\nIn 1993, Constantine Koukias was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House Trust in association with REM Theatre to compose \"Icon\", a large-scale music theatre piece for the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House \n\nDuring the 2000 Summer Olympics, the venue served as the focal point for the triathlon events. The event had a swimming loop at Farm Cove, along with competitions in the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens for the cycling and running portions of the event.\n\nSince 2013, a group of residents from the nearby Bennelong Apartments (better known as 'The Toaster'), calling themselves the Sydney Opera House Concerned Citizens Group, have been campaigning against Forecourt Concerts on the grounds that they exceed noise levels outlined in the development approval (DA). In February 2017 the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment handed down a $15,000 fine to the Sydney Opera House for breach of allowed noise levels at a concert held in November 2015. However the DA was amended in 2016 to allow an increase in noise levels in the forecourt by 5 decibels. The residents opposing the concerts contend that a new DA should have been filed rather than an amendment.\n\nThe Sydney Opera House sails formed a graphic projection-screen in a lightshow mounted in connection with the International Fleet Review in Sydney Harbour on 5 October 2013.\n\nOn 31 December 2013, the venue's 40th anniversary year, a New Year firework display was mounted for the first time in a decade. The Sydney Opera House hosted an event, 'the biggest blind date' on Friday 21 February 2014 that won an historic Guinness World Record. The longest continuous serving employee was commemorated on June 27th 2018, for 50 years of service.\n\nOn 5 October 2018 the Opera House chief executive Louise Herron clashed with Sydney radio commentator Alan Jones who called for her sacking for refusing to allow Racing NSW to use the Opera House sails to advertise The Everest horse race.  Within hours, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian overruled Herron. Two days later, Prime Minister Scott Morrison supported the decision, calling the Opera House \"the biggest billboard Sydney has\". The NSW Labor party leader, Luke Foley, and senior federal Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese have supported the proposal. The political view is not supported by significant public opinion, with a petition against the advertising collecting over 298,000 names by 9 October 2018. 235,000 printed petition documents were presented to the NSW parliament in the morning. A survey conducted on 8 October by market research firm Micromex found that 81% of those surveyed were not supportive of the premier's direction.\n\n\n\n\n This Wikipedia article was originally based on the \"Sydney Opera House\", listed on the \"New South Wales State Heritage Register\" published by the Government of New South Wales under CC-BY 3.0 AU licence (accessed on 3 September 2017).\n\n\n"}

It was designed by Earnest Woodrow and was first opened in 1900 as The New Grand Theatre of Varieties.\n\nThe theatre was built for a consortium which was led by the well-known music hall artistes Dan Leno, Herbert Campbell, Harry Randall, and Fred Williams. Today, it is a nightclub, live music venue, theatre and event space.\n\nThe venue opened on Monday 26 November 1900 as \"The New Grand Theatre of Varieties\", with a music hall production featuring many well-known artistes of the time. When the theatre opened it had a capacity of 3,000 and a stage .\n\nThe Grand continued to be a successful Music Hall and Variety venue for 40 years. In 1927, the theatre was fitted for cinema use and was known as The Grand Theatre, as it still mainly staged variety shows. From 8 May 1950, The Grand went on to become a full-time cinema after it was purchased by the Essoldo Cinema chain and was renamed Essoldo Cinema. The Essoldo Cinema closed on 31 August 1963 and became the Essoldo Bingo Club on 11 October 1963 which was later taken over by Classic Cinemas who renamed it Vogue Bingo Club. During this time, they built a false ceiling, cutting off the upper parts of the theatre. From 1972 until 1979, Mecca Bingo took over as the final bingo operator.\nThe building remained closed until 1989 when it was bought by The Mean Fiddler group to be transformed into a live music venue. Due to licensing issues the venue did not open until 17 December 1991. During the 10-year closure, the false ceiling was removed and the building was restored and redecorated. Mean Fiddler closed on 20 July 1997 after being mostly unsuccessful as a music venue and was then purchased by pub chain J.D.Wetherspoon. J.D.Wetherspoon were refused a license after a public enquiry but refused to sell the property when actors Colin and Vanessa Redgrave put forward plans to restore the building back to its original use.\n\nThe Grand is now an independently run venue which functions as a nightclub, live music venue, theatre and event space. Some of the acts to have performed at The Grand in recent years include; The Kinks, Chuck Berry, The Temptations, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Echo and the Bunnymen, Madness, Public Enemy, Jamiroquai, Chipmunk, Paul Weller, Oasis, Muse, Hole, The Verve and Jamie Cullum, The Jam and Brian May. It was also used as the studio location for the TV show Taskmaster.\n\n"}
