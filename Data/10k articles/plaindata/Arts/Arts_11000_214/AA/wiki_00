According to Homer she was the wife of Zethus, and the mother of Itylus.\n\nEnvious of Niobe, the wife of her husband's brother Amphion, who had six sons and six daughters, she formed the plan of killing the eldest of Niobe's sons, but by mistake slew her own son Itylus. Zeus relieved her grief by changing her into a nightingale, whose melancholy tunes are represented by the poet as Aëdon's lamentations about her child.\n\nAccording to a later tradition preserved in Antoninus Liberalis, Aëdon is instead the wife of Polytechnos, an artist of Colophon. The couple boasted that they loved each other more than Hera and Zeus. Hera sent Eris to cause trouble between the two of them. Polytechnus was then making a chair, and Aëdon a piece of embroidery, and they agreed that whoever should finish the work first should receive from the other a female slave as the prize. Polytechnos was furious when Aëdon (with Hera's help) won. He went to Aëdon's father, and pretending that his wife wished to see her sister Chelidonis, he took her with him. On his way home he raped her, dressed her in slave's attire, commanded her to silence, and gave her to his wife as the promised prize. After some time Chelidonis, believing herself unobserved, lamented her own fate, but she was overheard by Aëdon, and the two sisters conspired against Polytechnus for revenge. They murdered Polytechnos' son Itys and served him up as a meal to his father.\n\nAëdon then fled with Chelidonis to her father, who, when Polytechnos came in pursuit of his wife, had him bound, smeared with honey, and exposed to the insects. Aëdon now took pity upon the sufferings of her husband, and when her relations were on the point of killing her for this weakness, Zeus changed Polytechnos into a pelican, the brother of Aëdon into a whoop, her father into a sea-eagle, Chelidonis into a swallow, and Aëdon herself into a nightingale. This myth seems to have originated in mere etymologies, and is of the same class as that about Philomela and Procne.\n"}

Its permanent home is the Staatsoper Unter den Linden, commonly referred to as \"Lindenoper\", in the central Mitte district, which also hosts the Staatskapelle Berlin orchestra. Originally the \"Hofoper\" (court opera) from 1742, it was named \"Königliches Opernhaus\" (Royal Opera House) in 1844, and \"Staatsoper Unter den Linden\" in 1918. From 1949 to 1990 it housed the state opera of East Germany. Since 2004, the State Opera company belongs to the Berlin Opera Foundation, like the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Komische Oper Berlin, the Berlin State Ballet, and the Bühnenservice Berlin (Stage and Costume Design).\n\nKing Frederick II of Prussia shortly after his accession to the throne commissioned the original building on the site. Construction work began in July 1741 with what was designed by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff to be the first part of a \"Forum Fredericianum\" on present-day Bebelplatz. Although not entirely completed, the Court Opera (\"Hofoper\") was inaugurated with a performance of Carl Heinrich Graun's \"Cesare e Cleopatra\" on December 7, 1742. This event marked the beginning of the successful, 250-year co-operation between the Staatsoper and the Staatskapelle Berlin, the state orchestra, whose roots trace back to the 16th century.\n\nIn 1821, the Berlin Opera—hosted at the Schauspielhaus Berlin—gave the premiere of Weber's \"Der Freischütz\". In 1842, Wilhelm Taubert instituted the tradition of regular symphonic concerts. In the same year, Giacomo Meyerbeer succeeded Gaspare Spontini as General Music Director. Felix Mendelssohn also conducted symphonic concerts for a year.\n\nOn August 18, 1843 the Linden Opera was destroyed by fire. The reconstruction of the building was supervised by architect Carl Ferdinand Langhans, and the Königliches Opernhaus (Royal Opera House) was inaugurated the following autumn by a performance of Meyerbeer's \"Ein Feldlager in Schlesien\". In 1849, Otto Nicolai's \"Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor\" was premiered at the Royal Opera House, conducted by the composer.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the Royal Court Opera, Berlin, attracted many illustrious conductors. They included Felix von Weingartner, Karl Muck, Richard Strauss, and Leo Blech. After the collapse of the German Empire in 1918, the Opera was renamed \"Staatsoper unter den Linden\" and the \"Königliche Kapelle\" became \"Kapelle der Staatsoper\".\n\nIn the 1920s, Kurt Adler, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Erich Kleiber, Otto Klemperer, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Bruno Walter occupied the conductor's post. In 1925, Alban Berg's \"Wozzeck\", was given its premiere in a production conducted by Erich Kleiber in the composer's presence.\n\nAfter having undergone an extensive renovation, the Linden Opera reopened on 28 April 1928 with a new production of Mozart's \"Die Zauberflöte\". The cast included Delia Reinhardt, Richard Tauber, Friedrich Schorr and Leo Schützendorf, conducted by Erich Kleiber. The same year, the famous Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin and Serge Diaghilev's \"Ballets Russes\" with conductor Ernest Ansermet were guest performers. In 1930 Erich Kleiber conducted the premiere of Darius Milhaud's \"Christophe Colomb\". However, in 1934, when symphonic pieces from Alban Berg's \"Lulu\" were performed by Kleiber, the National Socialists provoked a scandal and the conductor was forced into exile.\n\nAfter Hitler's Nazi takeover, members of Jewish origin were dismissed from the ensemble. Many German musicians associated with the opera went into exile, including the conductors Kurt Adler, Otto Klemperer and Fritz Busch. Clemens Krauss became a prominent German conductor first at the Berlin State Opera in 1933 and was then appointed as its director in 1935 due to Fritz Busch and Erich Kleiber resigning, respectively, their positions in protest over Nazi rule. During the Third Reich, Robert Heger, Herbert von Karajan (1939–1945) and Johannes Schüler were the \"Staatskapellmeister\".\n\nThe second rebuilding took a long time. From 1945, the opera company played in the former \"Admiralspalast\" (today's \"Metropoltheater\"). From 1949, the company served as the state opera of East Germany. It moved back to its original home after the rebuilding in freely adapted baroque forms was finally completed in 1955. The newly rebuilt opera house was opened, again, with Wagner's \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\". The capacity is now about 1,300. After the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, the Opera was somewhat isolated, but still maintained a comprehensive repertoire that featured the classic and romantic period together with contemporary ballet and operas.\n\nAfter reunification, the Linden Opera rejoined the operatic world. Important works that had already performed in the past were rediscovered and discussed anew within the framework of a \"Berlin Dramaturgy\". Baroque Opera in particular was at the center of attention, with Graun's \"Cleopatra e Cesare\", Keiser's \"Croesus\", Florian Leopold Gassmann's \"L'opera seria\" and Scarlatti's \"Griselda\". These works were performed by Belgian conductor René Jacobs together with the Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin and the Freiburger Barockorchester on period instruments. In the 1990s, the opera was officially renamed \"Staatsoper Unter den Linden\".\n\nIn 1992, the Argentine-Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim was appointed Music Director. In 2000, the orchestra (according to its official website) elected Barenboim \"conductor for life.\" During the 2002 \"Festtage\", he led a Wagner cycle in ten parts, a production created in collaboration with director Harry Kupfer.\n\nSince 2009, the Berlin State Opera has been undergoing considerable renovation work led by German architect HG Merz. The roof of the opera building was raised and the proscenium prolonged to improve the acoustics. Other renovation and extension works include the director's building, the below-ground connection building and the depot building. The latter will house the new rehearsal center.\n\nThe house was reopened in 2017 with premieres of Humperdinck's \"Hänsel und Gretel\" and Monteverdi's \"L'incoronazione di Poppea\" on one weekend.\n\n\n"}

Completed in 1836, it is thought to be one of Delaroche's greatest masterpieces. It was displayed as part of the Bridgewater Collection in London, although it was latterly thought to have been lost when, during The Blitz of 1941, a German bomb struck close to Bridgewater House, causing shrapnel damage to the canvas in the ensuing explosion. In 2009 it was rediscovered in Scotland in an unexpectedly good condition, having been rolled up and stored after the war, but recorded in the intervening years as badly damaged or destroyed. After a partial restoration it went on display in the National Gallery in London, in an exhibition re-appraising Delaroche's work. After the exhibition, it is to be fully restored.\n\n\"Charles I Insulted\" features Charles I, the King of England, who had by 1648 lost the Second English Civil War fought against Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army, after the Battle of Preston. By January 1649, he was being put on trial for treason, and on 30 January, he was beheaded.\n\nThe painting depicts Charles in the days before his execution, being bullied and taunted by Cromwell's defiant troops, one of whom is blowing pipe smoke in his face. The deposed king remains calm, holding a book which he appears to have been reading.\n\nDelaroche's \"Charles I Insulted\" was commissioned by Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere, who was known as Lord Francis Leveson-Gower until 1833 when, following the death of his father, he was created the first Earl of Ellesmere, inheriting Bridgewater House in London from his bachelor great uncle, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. The family line of the Earls of Ellesmere became the Dukes of Sutherland when, in 1963, John Egerton, 5th Earl of Ellesmere, succeeded to the title of duke of Sutherland on the death of the 5th Duke of Sutherland with no male heir in the elder line. As of its rediscovery in 2009, the painting remained privately owned by the present Duke, Francis Egerton, 7th Duke of Sutherland. The 7th Duke was the 6th Duke's cousin and heir to the Dukedom, since the 6th Duke had no children himself.\n\n\"Charles I Insulted\" is a large piece, painted on a canvas measuring by ., also described as being nearly three metres square. It was completed in 1836. It was first displayed at the Paris Salon of 1837, and in 1838 at the British Institution in London. The painting was then hung for decades as part of the semi-public Bridgewater Collection in Bridgewater House in London.\n\nThe painting suffered serious damage during a Second World War German bombing raid on London. Unlike other collections, the Bridgewater artworks had not been stored underground before the war, due to the 5th Earl having been captured at Dunkirk in 1940. On 11 May 1941, during the last night and most deadly raid of what became known as The Blitz, one bomb landed on the street outside Bridgewater House, leaving a deep bomb crater. Hanging in the dining room at the time, the painting suffered extensive shrapnel damage. At least four paintings in the collection were totally destroyed in the raid, while others less damaged were eventually restored. \"Charles I Insulted\" was demounted, and rolled up, having been given a rudimentary repair using paper to hold together the largest tears. After the war, it was transported to Mertoun House in St. Boswells, Scottish Borders, the family's Scottish home, for storage.\n\nWhile stored safe and dry in Mertoun, over the next 68 years the existence of the painting was gradually forgotten about by its owners, and presumed by the art world to be lost as irreparably damaged in the raid. In subsequent catalogues of Delaroche's work, it had been listed as either 'badly damaged' or sometimes 'destroyed'.\n\nThe painting was rediscovered in the summer of 2009 by National Gallery curators, after they made enquiries about the painting as they prepared a Delaroche exhibition. The 2010 exhibition was to be the first major show on Delaroche to be held in Britain, aiming to re-assess the works of Delaroche, who fell out of fashion during the early 20th century, and featuring his most famous work from the National Gallery collection, \"The Execution of Lady Jane Grey\" (1833), which was also a rediscovered work: it had been thought lost when the Tate Gallery was flooded in 1928, and found rolled up in 1973.\n\nOn 7 June 2009 at Mertoun, it was unrolled for the first time since being moved to Scotland. To the surprise of those present, the painting was largely intact, having \"lost none of its intensity\". The explosion damage consisted of around 200 individual tears in the canvas, which still contained plaster fragments and dust from the blast.\n\nAfter moving the painting to London, it was restored sufficiently to be able to be displayed in the exhibition, albeit with the shrapnel scars still visible, and \"somewhat yellowed by a layer of discoloured varnish\". Because the canvas had been rolled up for nearly 70 years, it had to be weighed down flat for six weeks. The tears were then stitched together, and the canvas lined.\n\nThe painting's first ever public display since rediscovery was as part of the exhibition \"Painting History: Delaroche and Lady Jane Grey\", running from 24 February to 24 May 2010. It went on display on 23 February in a separate room in the museum's free admission area, with the main part of the exhibition held in the adjacent Sainsbury Wing of the gallery. The painting is to be fully restored after the London exhibition whereupon work would start to remove the discoloured varnish and retouch the damaged areas.\n\nAccording to the London National Gallery, it is \"one of the great paintings on themes of English history for which Delaroche had become renowned\", in which Delaroche was \"able to imply striking parallels between the poignant fate of Charles and the recent course of French history\". According to the gallery director Nicholas Penny, the rediscovery was \"huge\" and its redisplay would be an historic moment, describing it as \"an extraordinarily powerful work\", \"one of the great French paintings\" and by \"one of the greatest painters\" of the 19th century. According to Penny, Delaroche, a Frenchman, was a notable painter of Tudor and Stuart history, as a method of \"exploring the violence and vicissitudes of the French Revolution\" without actually portraying the events themselves, which were regarded as too recent to paint.\n\nAccording to the National Gallery's exhibition curator Christopher Riopelle, both \"Charles I Insulted\" and Delaroche's other painting, \"Marie-Antoinette Before the Tribunal\", painted fifteen years later in 1851, \"suggest episodes of the suffering of Christ\". Riopelle added that Delaroche's \"obsession with English royalist history\" was \"classic displacement of what you want to talk about but can't, because it's still so raw and recent\", particularly referring to the execution of Louis XVI of France in January 1793, and nine months later of his Queen Marie Antoinette.\n\nCharlotte Higgins of \"The Guardian\" described it as \"one of Delaroche's masterpieces\", which \"owes a debt\" to Anthony van Dyck's famous painting of Charles I. Higgins also said that it \"clearly references the popular artistic subject of the mocking of Christ by his guards\". According to Arifa Akbar of \"The Independent\", \"Delaroche's monumental painting featuring Charles I as a Christ-like figure\" is regarded as \"one of Delaroche's most powerful pieces\", commissioned at the \"height of his fame\".\n\nDavid Horspool of \"The Times\", reflecting on the fate of Delaroche's \"Execution of Lady Jane Grey\" which was relegated to a basement, in which it was later flood damaged, due to Delaroche's falling fame, said \"there seems no chance that [\"Charles I Insulted\"] will be rolled up and put away. Delaroche's days as the forgotten master seem to be over\", predicting the rediscovered piece would be perhaps \"the most exciting exhibit to go on display\" in the 2010 National Gallery exhibition.\n"}

For example, the New Zealand flag is the British Blue Ensign defaced with a Southern Cross in the fly. In the context of vexillology, the word \"deface\" carries no negative connotations, in contrast to general usage. It simply indicates differentiation of the flag from that of another owner by addition of elements. For example, many state flags are formed by defacing the national flag with a coat of arms.\nWhere countries pass through changes of regime with contrasting ideological orientations (monarchist/republican, fascist/democratic, communist/capitalist, secular/religious etc.)—all of which, despite their differences, claim allegiance to a common national heritage expressed in a venerated national flag—it can happen that a new regime defaces that flag with its own specific emblem while keeping the basic flag design unchanged. Such changing ideological emblems appeared over time, among others, on the flags of Italy, Hungary, Romania, Germany (West and East, see illustration) Ethiopia and Iran. As a result, during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Romanian Revolution of 1989, insurgents tore out of the national flag the emblem of the regime which they opposed and waved the flag itself with which they identified. \n\nAn already defaced flag can be further defaced. For example, the Australian flag is a defaced Blue Ensign. The Australian Border Force Flag is further defaced with the words \"Australian border force\" in block letters.\n\nIn the United States, it is against the Flag Code to deface the national flag with advertising or with any other sigil, image or insignia. Such flags are nevertheless commercially available, depicting the seals of various branches of the U.S. military, Native American related objects such as tomahawks or war bonnets, and the like.\n\nIt is common for association football supporters travelling abroad for a match to bring a national flag defaced with the name of their hometown or a similar local identifier.\n"}

It was produced by Dino De Laurentiis and has a music score by Ennio Morricone. It was distributed by Paramount Pictures in the United States.\n\nA woman spy and some male agents working for the Germans during World War I land at night near the British naval base at Scapa Flow, from a U-boat. The British, led by Col. Foreman, ambush the landing party, capturing two of the men, but the woman gets away. Foreman fakes the execution of one of the spies, thus tricking the second one, Meyer, into becoming a double agent in the hopes of using him to capture his woman accomplice, whom Meyer identifies under the codename Fraulein Doktor. Fraulein Doktor is portrayed as a brilliant spy who stole a formula for a skin blistering gas similar to mustard gas which the Germans used to great effect against the Allies on the battlefield. \n\nMeanwhile, Fraulein Doktor seduces a laundryman to find out which ship Lord Kitchener will be sailing on to Russia, and when it will sail.

The film depicts the everyday lives of two reclusive, formerly upper class women, a mother and daughter both named Edith Beale, who lived in poverty at Grey Gardens, a derelict mansion at 3 West End Road in the wealthy Georgica Pond neighborhood of East Hampton, New York. The film was screened at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival but was not entered into the main competition.\n\nEllen Hovde and Muffie Meyer also directed, and Susan Froemke was the associate producer. The film's editors are credited as Hovde (who also edited \"Gimme Shelter\" and \"Salesman\"), Meyer and Froemke.\n\nIn 2010 the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In a 2014 \"Sight and Sound\" poll, film critics voted \"Grey Gardens\" the joint ninth best documentary film of all time.\n\n\nEdith Ewing Bouvier Beale (1895–1977), known as \"Big Edie\", and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (1917–2002), known as \"Little Edie\", were the aunt and the first cousin, respectively, of former US First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The two women lived together at the Grey Gardens estate for decades with limited funds in increasing squalor and isolation.\n\nThe house was designed in 1897 by Joseph Greenleaf Thorpe and purchased in 1923 by \"Big Edie\" and her husband Phelan Beale. After Phelan left his wife, \"Big Edie\" and \"Little Edie\" lived there for more than 50 years. The house was called Grey Gardens because of the color of the dunes, the cement garden walls, and the sea mist.\n\nThroughout the fall of 1971 and into 1972, their living conditions—their house was infested by fleas, inhabited by numerous cats and raccoons, deprived of running water, and filled with garbage and decay—were exposed as the result of an article in the \"National Enquirer\" and a cover story in \"New York Magazine\" after a series of inspections (which the Beales called \"raids\") by the Suffolk County Health Department. With the Beale women facing eviction and the razing of their house, in the summer of 1972 Jacqueline Onassis and her sister Lee Radziwill provided the necessary funds to stabilize and repair the dilapidated house so that it would meet village codes.\n\nAlbert and David Maysles became interested in their story and received permission to film a documentary about the women, which was released in 1976 to wide critical acclaim. Their \"direct cinema\" technique left the women to tell their own stories.\n\nAlbert and David Maysles initially came into contact with the Beales after Lee Radziwill suggested they make a documentary on her childhood in East Hampton and brought them with her on a trip to Grey Gardens. According to Ellen Hovde, the initial film was being funded by Radziwill; when the Maysles attempted to show her their early footage of the Beales to convince her that a documentary about them was a better idea, Radziwill confiscated their negatives and withdrew her funding.\n\nThe Maysles brothers shot and recorded all the footage themselves. Ellen Hovde and Muffie Meyer received co-directing credit for their editing work.\n\n\n\"Big Edie\" died in 1977 and \"Little Edie\" sold the house in 1979 for $220,000 ($ today) to Sally Quinn and her husband, longtime \"Washington Post\" editor Ben Bradlee, who promised to restore the dilapidated structure (the sale agreement forbade razing the house). The couple subsequently restored the house and grounds. \"Little Edie\" died in Florida in 2002 at the age of 84.\n\nJerry Torre, the teenaged handyman shown in the documentary (nicknamed The Marble Faun by \"Little Edie\"), was sought by the filmmakers for years afterward, and was found by chance in 2005 driving a New York City taxicab. A 2011 documentary, \"The Marble Faun of Grey Gardens\" by Jason Hay and Steve Pelizza, showed that he was then a sculptor at The Art Students League of New York.\n\nLois Wright, one of the two birthday party guests in the film, has hosted a public television show in East Hampton since the 1980s. She wrote a book about her experiences at the house with the Beales.\n\nIn 2006, Maysles made available previously unreleased footage for a special two-disc edition for the Criterion Collection. It included a new feature titled \"The Beales of Grey Gardens\", which also received a limited theatrical release. In 2018, a prequel, \"That Summer,\" shot in 1972 and using 16mm footage, was released.\n\nThe documentary, and the women's story, were adapted as a full-length musical, \"Grey Gardens\", with book by Doug Wright, music by Scott Frankel and lyrics by Michael Korie. Starring Christine Ebersole and Mary Louise Wilson, the show premiered at Playwrights Horizons in New York City in February 2006. The musical re-opened on Broadway in November 2006 at the Walter Kerr Theatre, and was included in more than 25 \"Best of 2006\" lists in newspapers and magazines. The production won a Tony Award for Best Costume Design, and Ebersole and Wilson each won Tony Awards for their performances. The Broadway production closed on July 29, 2007. It was the first musical on Broadway ever to be adapted from a documentary.\n\n\"Grey Gardens\", an HBO film, stars Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore as the Edies, with Jeanne Tripplehorn as Jacqueline Kennedy, and Daniel Baldwin as Julius Krug. Directed and co-written (with Patricia Rozema) by filmmaker Michael Sucsy, filming began on October 22, 2007, in Toronto. It flashes back and forth between Little Edie's life as a young woman and the actual filming/premiere of the 1975 documentary. First aired on HBO on April 18, 2009, the film won six Primetime Emmys. and two Golden Globes.\n\nIn 2008, \"Little Edie & The Marble Faun\" premiered as part of the Metropolitan Playhouse's Annual Author Festival. In a mashup between Grey Gardens and Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Marble Faun\", the relationship between Little Edie, Big Edie and Jerry was explored.\n\nIn 1999, fashion photographer Steven Meisel shot an editorial, with the same name, featuring Amber Valletta, for \"Vogue Italia\".\n\nRufus Wainwright's song \"Grey Gardens\" appears on his 2001 album \"Poses\". \n\nCanadian rock band Stars' song \"The Woods\" from their album \"Heart\" contains samples of dialogue from the film. \n\nAmerican band Six Gallery has a song \"Edie and the Marble Faun,\" the lyrics of which talk about the documentary.\n\nIn the season 3 \"Gilmore Girls\" episode, \"A Deep Fried Korean Thanksgiving\", the episode begins with Lorelai and Rory watching \"Grey Gardens\". \n\nThe \"Comedy Central Roast of Joan Rivers\" (2009) featured a joke by comic impressionist Mario Cantone that Joan and her daughter Melissa starred together in a TV movie titled \"Grey Gardens\".\n\nOn NBC's \"The New Normal\", season 1, episode #2: \"Sofa's Choice\" (2012), a character impersonates Little Edie.\n\nGrey Gardens has been mentioned on \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" more than once: in season 4, contestant Sharon Needles dressed as Edie for a cat-themed magazine cover; and in season 5, episode 5: \"Snatch Game\", contestant Jinkx Monsoon participated in a \"Match Game\"–style challenge impersonating Little Edie.\n\nIn 2015, the IFC series \"Documentary Now!\" features a \"Grey Gardens\" parody called \"Sandy Passage.\" The episode was written by Seth Meyers and stars Bill Hader and Fred Armisen as \"Little Vivvy\" and \"Big Vivvy.\"\n\nIn part 3 of Bravo's Season 6 \"The Real Housewives\" of New York reunion episode, host Andy Cohen suggests to cast member Sonja Morgan \"...you have a little Grey Gardens in you\".

The ateliers belonged to a Praça da Sé building named \"Palacete Santa Helena\". This building was demolished in 1971, when the Sé station of São Paulo Metro was built.\n\nThe Santa Helena Group was formed spontaneously, without any conceptual commitment. Most of its members were Italian immigrants, like Alfredo Volpi and Fulvio Pennacchi; sons of Italian immigrants, like Aldo Bonadei, Alfredo Rizzotti, Mario Zanini and Humberto Rosa; some were Spanish immigrants like Francisco Rebolo; some Portuguese immigrants like Manuel Martins.\n\nThey all shared a humble origin, and worked as artisans or proletarians. Rebolo, Volpi and Zanini were wall painters. Clóvis Graciano was a railroad worker. Fulvio Pennacchi was a butcher. Aldo Bonadei worked with costume design and embroidery. Rizzotti was an auto mechanic and a lathe worker. Manoel Martins was a goldsmith. Rebolo was a football player. Humberto Rosa and Pennacchi taught drawing. Painting was for the weekends or leisure time.\n\nMost of them had courses in the \"Liceu de Artes e Ofícios\" (or \"Arts and Crafts Lyceum\", that was one Liceo scientifico), or the \"Escola Profissional Masculina do Brás\" (or \"Men's Professional School of Brás\"). However, they reduced what they learned to drawing and painting techniques, not to the academic guiding of formal order, were they aware of that or not.\n\nBy this time, some painters associations were created in São Paulo, like the \"Sociedade Pró-Arte Moderna\" (or \"Pro-Modern Art Society\", aka SPAM) or \"Clube dos Artistas Modernos\" (CAM, or \"Modern Artists Club\"). They joined the participants of the \"Semana de Arte Moderna\" (or \"Modern Art Week\"). These groups were formed by intellectuals and members of the São Paulo elite, which kept a great distance from the Santa Helena members and other proletarian groups, about which they had little or no knowledge.\n\nThe group union, that lasted for years, can be explained as a reaction against the enormous prejudice that existed about the poor immigrants, that came not only from the pre-existent Brazilian elite families, but also from immigrants that became wealthy in Brazil. That prejudice was made clear in several criticisms that were directed to the Group's work, particularly when it started to cause a sensation, and to threaten positions already established.\n\nSome Santa Helena artists had already studied art in Europe before arriving in Brazil; for instance Pennacchi, Rizzotti and Bonadei. All others had difficulty learning about the art created there, and could only be taught by teachers in Brazil. Bonadei was a student of Pedro Alexandrino, Antonio Rocco and Amadeo Scavone. Graciano was taught by Waldemar da Costa, and Zanini was a Georg Elpons student.\n\nThe perseverance of the group, in its fight for survival, caused interest and attracted new friends and partners. So, in due time, the place became the meeting point of many other artists.\n\nThe Santa Helena Group's major achievement was to reveal some of the most important Brazilian visual artists of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1937, an exhibition named \"Família Artística Paulista\", or \"Artistic Family of São Paulo\" shown a set of artists, including the \"Grupo Santa Helena\", that could show their work publicly for the first time. From then on, the Grupo became known. They provoked the interest of Mário de Andrade, that identified in them a \"São Paulo school of painting\".\n\nIn 1940, the \"Exhibition of French Painters\", that presented Cézanne, Picasso, Braque and Gris, among others, caused an enormous impact and several components of the group started to redirect his work, what made them more distant of the Grupo's themes or in their formal aspects.\n\n\n"}

It replaced stamp mills for preparing pulp because the Hollander could produce in one day the same quantity of pulp it would take a stamp mill eight days to prepare.\n\nHowever, the wooden paddles and beating process of a stamp mill produced longer, more easily hydrated, and more fibrillated cellulose fibers; thus increasing the resulting paper's strength. The Hollander used metal blades and a chopping action to cut the raw material, resulting in shorter cellulose fibers and weaker paper. Further, the metal blades of the Hollander often introduced metal contaminants into the paper as one metal blade struck another. These contaminants often acted as catalysts for oxidation that have been implicated in browning of old paper called foxing.\n\nIn turn, the Hollander was (partially) replaced by the conical refiner or Jordan refiner, named after its American inventor Joseph Jordan, who patented the device in 1858.\n\nA Hollander beater design consists of a circular or ovoid water raceway with a beater wheel at a single point along the raceway. The beater wheel is a centrifugal compressor or radial impeller cylinder parallel to a grooved plate, similar to the construction of a water wheel or timing pulley. Under power, the blades rotate to beat the fiber into a usable pulp slurry. The beater wheel and plate do not touch, as this would result in cutting. The distance between the two is adjusted to increase or decrease the pressure on the fibers when passing through the beater.\n\nThe objective of using a beater (rather than another process like grinding, as many wood-pulp mills do) is to create longer, hydrated, fibrillated fibers. (Fibrillated fibers are abraded to the extent that many partially broken-off fibers extend from the main fiber, increasing the fiber's surface area, and hence its potential for hydrogen bonding). Grinding of fibers is not desirable. Therefore, the \"blades\" are not what might be thought of as \"sharpened,\" and well-designed beaters make it possible to minimize the shear action of the rotating blades against the bottom of the water raceway.\n\n"}
{"id": "50323022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50323022", "title": "Inger on the Beach", "text": "Inger on the Beach\n\nInger on the Beach (also \"Summernacht\"; Norwegian: \"Inger på stranden, Sommernatt\") is a painting by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch. It was created in the summer of 1889, at Åsgårdstrand and is a portrait of Munch's youngest sister Inger.\n\nA young woman, identified by the title as Munch's youngest sister Inger, sits in a quiet pose, a straw hat in her hands, on a large granite rock and holds her head in profile. Her bright white dress contrasts with the green mossy stones and the blues and purples of the sea water behind her, which, as the alternative titles indicate, suggests \"Nordic summer nights\". Only a few pots and a fishing boat behind her betray human life in the countryside.\n\nMunch used a similar pose for his 1884 interior composition \"Morning\", featuring a girl on the edge of a bed.\n\nIn the summer of 1889, Munch rented a small house in Åsgårdstrand, a small Norwegian coastal town on the Oslofjord, which served as a summer resort of many citizens and artists from nearby Kristiana, now Oslo. Among them were Munch's friends Christian Krohg and Frits Thaulow. The place acquired great importance in the life of Munch: Here he spent not only many summers, and bought in 1897 a house, it was the place for many important pictures of his life work. In 1889, his first year in Åsgårdstrand, he painted \"Inger on the beach\". The model was his youngest sister Inger, who had previously modeled for him. The painting was preceded by a series of studies Munch made between 9 and 11 pm to study the lighting conditions of Norwegian summer night.\n\nUlrich Bischoff suggests that—unlike Munch's earlier 1884 portrait of the then 14-year-old Inger in her black confirmation dress, a youthful work in the tradition of portraiture of the 19th century—\"Inger on the beach\" shows the future importance of the artist. Munch displays in this work his artistic repertoire for expressing loneliness, melancholy and angst, and foreshadows the compositional breakdown in horizontal and vertical axes of the later \"Frieze of Life\".\n\nFor Reinhold Heller the painting conveys less a time of day than a mood, created by the contours and dimensional representations of figure and stones, the nonexistent horizon between sky and sea, and the almost monochrome blue.\nAnni Carlsson describes the work as a \"character landscape\" in which the beach, sea and figure are incorporated into a mood and the boundaries cancel space. \n\nIn a later statement, Munch compared seaside rocks with living creatures, goblins and sea spirits: \"In the night's light which forms have fantastic tones\". Nicolay Stang compares the \"simplification of form and color, which is a colored form against the other\" to Paul Gauguin, a painter whose work was familiar to Munch before 1889.\n\nTone Skedsmo says \"Inger on the beach\" is in the tradition of the naturalistic painters of the \"Fleksum colony\", namely Christian Skredsvig, Eilif Peterssen, Erik Werenskiold, Gerhard Munthe, Kitty Kielland and Harriet Backer, who were known for their quiet summer night moods. While the composition of a figure in a landscape and the elegiac mood are typical of the work of Munch's Norwegian colleagues, Munch's simplification of forms to express a mood adds elements of modernity. He may have been influenced by Puvis de Chavannes and Jules Bastien-Lepage, whom he had met at the Exposition Universelle d'Anvers (1885), in the rigid countenance of Ingers with her blank stare and the dry handling of the paint.\n\nA few months after its completion, the painting (originally titled \"Evening\") was displayed for the first time at the annual autumn exhibition in Kristiana, while Munch had already traveled to Paris to collect impressions of the local art scene through which his symbolism would find expressive style. \nThe contemporary criticism was extremely hostile. \n\"Morgenbladet\" called the painting pure \"gibberish\" and said the public was being bamboozled. Other voices criticized the \"easily thrown stones that seem to be made only from soft, shapeless substance\".\n\"Aftenposten\" described the seated figure as \"a physical entity with no trace of life and expression, as untrue in the form as in the color [...] On the whole this seems to us to have such a low artistic value that his presence at the exhibition itself is difficult to defend. \" Dagbladet nevertheless pointed out: \"To understand it, one must constantly have in mind that Munch poet is - a person who can be entirely covered by a mood to her and her playing devotedly, without regard to conventional laws and forms, often with a tendency to fantasy. \"\n\nMunch's Norwegian colleague Erik Werenskiold bought it directly from the exhibition in 1909; it was acquired in 1924 by the Norwegian art collector Rasmus Meyer as part of his public collections in Bergen.\n\n"}

Though the term \"inscape\" has been applied to stylistically diverse artworks, it usually conveys some notion of representing the artist's psyche as a kind of interior landscape. The word \"inscape\" can therefore be read as a kind of portmanteau, combining \"interior\" (or \"inward\") with \"landscape\".\n\nAccording to Professor Claude Cernuschi, writing in a catalogue for a Matta exhibition at Boston College (see external link below), Matta's use of the term \"inscape\" for a series of landscape-like abstract or surrealist paintings reflects \"the psychoanalytic view of the mind as a three-dimensional space: the 'inscape'.\" The 'inscape' concept is particularly apt for Matta's works of the late 1930s. As Dawn Adès (p. 233) writes, \"A series of brilliant oil paintings done during the years of his [Matta's] first association with the Surrealists explore visual metaphors for the mental landscape.\" And Valerie Fletcher, in \"Crosscurrents of Modernism\" (p. 241), writes that during this time Matta \"created with startling mastery the paintings he called 'inscapes' or 'psychological morphologies.' \" See also Miriam Basilio's essay, \"Wifredo Lam's 'The Jungle' and Matta's 'Inscapes' \".\n\nThe term \"inscape\" was later taken up by the leading Australian surrealist James Gleeson, American abstract artists such as James Brooks, Jane Frank, and Mary Frank (no relation), and even a group of British fantasy artists founded by Brigid Marlin in 1961 and calling themselves the 'Inscape Group.' (The latter group may have had in mind another sense of the word 'inscape', associated with the British poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. See the article titled simply 'inscape' for more information on this.) More recently, in a 1998 review of a Mary Frank exhibition in New York City (cited below), Carol Diehl writes, \"Titled 'Inscapes', the paintings are landscapes of the soul...\"\n\nAlso clearly referring to the psychoanalytical meaning of the word as described by Prof. Cernuschi and others above, the leading journal of art therapy was formerly called simply \"Inscape\". The journal is now called \"International journal of art therapy : Inscape.\" (This is not to be confused with the \"Inscape\" magazine produced by Brigid Marlin's Society for Art of Imagination.)\n\nThe word \"inscape\" is sometimes used, perhaps with a bit of poetic license, to refer to the domain of interior design, suggesting that the interior of a house or building is a kind of interior (or indoor) landscape, a counterpart to the landscape surrounding the structure. This is the sense suggested by the name of the South African interior design school Inscape Design College, which see. It could be, however, that this use of the term is intended as a double-entendre, evoking those other meanings of \"inscape\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Pope Gregory I (c. 540–604) is shown saying Mass just as a vision of Christ as the \"Man of Sorrows\" has appeared on the altar in front of him, in response to the Pope's prayers for a sign to convince a doubter of the doctrine of transubstantiation.\n\nThe earliest version of the story is found in the 8th-century biography of Gregory by Paul the Deacon, and was repeated in the 9th-century one by John the Deacon. In this version, the Pope was saying Mass when a woman present started to laugh at the time of the Communion, saying to a companion that she could not believe the bread was Christ, as she herself had baked it. Gregory prayed for a sign, and the host turned into a bleeding finger. \nThis story is retained in the popular 13th century compilation the \"Golden Legend\", but other versions conflate the legend with other stories and the finger is changed into a visionary appearance of the whole of Christ on the altar, and the doubter becomes one of the deacons.\n\nThe story was hardly seen in art until the Jubilee Year of 1350, when pilgrims to Rome saw a Byzantine icon, the \"Imago Pietatis\", in the basilica of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, which was claimed to have been made at the time of the vision as a true representation. In this the figure of Christ was typical of the Byzantine forerunners of the \"Man of Sorrows\", at half-length, with crossed hands and a head slumped sideways to the viewer's left. According to Gertrud Schiller and the German scholars she cites, this has now been lost, but is known from many copies, including the small Byzantine micromosaic icon of about 1300 now in Santa Croce. This image seems to have had, perhaps initially only for the Jubilee, a Papal indulgence of 14,000 years granted for prayers said in its presence. This form of the image, converted to a more standard Western \"Man of Sorrows\", rising from the tabernacle on the altar, shown as a tomb-like box, with the \"Arma Christi\" around him, became standard across Europe, and very popular, especially north of the Alps, as an altarpiece, in miniatures in illuminated manuscripts, and other media. The strong connection of the image with indulgences was also maintained, and largely escaped from any Papal control. There was another Jubilee year in 1500, and the years on either side of this perhaps show the height of popularity of the image. It often appeared in books of hours, usually at the start of the Hours of the Cross or Penitential Psalms.\n\nThe iconography is one of a number of examples where detached andachtsbilder images such as the \"Man of Sorrows\" intended for intense personal meditation, are worked back into monumental compositions for prominent display. The deacon is invariably shown, and in larger compositions there is often a crowd of cardinals, attendants and worshippers, often with a donor portrait included. Sometimes the chalice on the altar is being filled with blood pouring from the wound in Christ's side. The head tilted to the left of the mosaic in Rome is typically retained in modified form. Sometimes Christ is full-length, and he may appear to be stepping forward onto the altar in later versions.\n\nThere were several prints that were often copied by artists, notably ten different engravings of the subject by Israhel van Meckenem and a woodcut by Albrecht Dürer of 1511. Many of these included printed indulgences, usually unauthorised. The oldest dated Aztec feather painting is a \"Mass\" of 1539 (see gallery) following one of the van Meckenem indulgence prints (not the one illustrated). The print illustrated began with a \"bootlegged\" indulgence of 20,000 years, but in a later state the plate has been altered to increase it to 45,000 years.\n\nWith the Protestant Reformation, an image that asserted both divine approval of the Papacy and the doctrine of the Real Presence was attractive to Catholics, and the iconography continued to be used.\n\n\n\nIndividual paintings in depth:\n"}

It is located on the north side of the Merdeka Square in Central Jakarta, Indonesia and is used as the official residence of the President of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nThe palace was a residence for the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies during the colonial era. In 1949, the palace was renamed Merdeka Palace, \"(ke)merdeka(an)\" meaning \"freedom\" or \"independence\".\n\nThe Merdeka Palace is part of the Jakarta Presidential Palace Complex, which also includes the Negara Palace, Wisma Negara (State Guesthouse), Sekretariat Negara (State Secretariat), and the Bina Graha building. It is the center of the Indonesian executive authority.\n\nThe building that is now the Merdeka Palace was built in the premise of the Rijswijk Palace (present Istana Negara) when it was considered no longer sufficed for administrative purposes e.g. big receptions and conferences during the mid-19th-century. In 1869, the instruction to construct a new palace was given by Governor-General Pieter Mijer. Construction took place on the south lawn of the Rijswijk Palace on March 23, 1873 during the tenure of Governor-General James Loudon.\n\nThe Neo-Palladian palace was designed by Jacobus Bartholomeus Drossaers and was built by the Department of Public Works and the contracting firm Drossaers & Company at a cost of ƒ 360,000. The new building was built in southern part of the Rijswijk Palace grounds, directly facing Koningsplein (now Merdeka Square).\n\nConstruction of the palace was finished in 1879 during the tenure of Governor-General Johan Wilhelm van Lansberge. The new palace was given the official name \"Paleis van de Gouverneur Generaal\" (\"Palace of the Governor-General\"), the official residence of the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies and his family.\n\nGovernor-General Johan Wilhelm van Lansberge (1875-1881) was the first to reside in the building. Governor-General Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer (1936-1942) was the last Dutch governor-general to reside in the Palace.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Indonesia (1942-1945), the \"Saiko Shikikan\" (army commander) of the Japanese garrison resided in the Rijswijk Palace compound. Three Japanese commanders have taken residence in the Merdeka Palace.\n\nThe Indonesian national revolution (1945–1949) ended with the Netherlands' recognition of the Republic of Indonesia. The Indonesian declaration of independence from the Dutch in 1949 was announced in Gambir Palace. During the ceremony, the Dutch flag was substituted with the Flag of Indonesia. Many spectators were rejoicing when the flag was hoisted, and yelled \"Merdeka! (Freedom!)\". From that moment, Gambir Palace became known as Merdeka Palace. Tony Lovink, the High Commissioner of the Dutch Crown was the last man representing the Dutch power to leave the Palace. The name of the palace officially changed to Istana Merdeka (\"Indendepence Place\") on 28 December 1949 at 17.55 hours.\n\nOn 27 December 1949, a day after the ceremony, President Sukarno and his family arrived from Yogyakarta. For the first time, the President of the Republic of Indonesia settled in Merdeka Palace.\n\nThe first annual Independence Day ceremony was held at the Merdeka Palace in 1950.\n\nThe building has remain unchanged since the building was finished in 1879. After the Indonesian independence, the Merdeka Palace compound was expanded to include not only Istana Negara (State Palace), but also to construct Wisma Negara, Sekretariat Negara (State Sectreatiat) and Bina Graha. Several colonial buildings and residences were demolished in the Weltevreden area to make way for today's State Palace compound.\n\nA small octagonal gazebo located in the courtyard of the palace was used as private school for Sukarno's and the palace staff's children. This gazebo was previously used by Dutch colonial officials as \"muziekkoepel\" (music gazebo), where music performances were played during formal balls.\n\nWhen Suharto became president of Indonesia, he made changes to the previously residential function of the Palace. Sukarno's bedroom was converted into Ruang Bendera Pustaka (Regalia Room) and the room of Sukarno's wife Fatmawati became the President's bedroom. An old wooden building in the palace complex known as \"Sanggar\" was demolished to make way for the Puri Bhakti Renatama building, and was used as a museum to store valuable artifacts, artwork and gifts from foreign emissaries. Later he also built the Bina Graha building on the palace grounds, which he used as his office.\n\nWhen Megawati took office, she had the Puri Bhakti Renatama building converted into the President's office, while its contents moved to Bina Graha building. She also restored the furniture and decorations of the palace back to the way it was under Sukarno. Suharto's Jepara wood carving furniture was removed, with the exception of the Ruang Jepara (Jepara Room, as a reminder of Suharto's regime), and replaced with the old colonial refurbishment.\n\nThe Merdeka Palace serves as an official venue for state events such as the Independence Day ceremony, welcoming (foreign) dignitaries, cabinet meetings, state banquets and reception of letters of credence from foreign ambassadors. Additionally, it still contains the president's private quarters and offices.\n\nThe administrative role that the palace once had, has been shifted to the State Palace and State Secretariat, while the Merdeka Palace remains a symbol of authority.\n\nA 17 m tall flagpole and a fountain are located on the front lawn of the Merdeka Palace. The annual flag raising ceremony takes place during the Indonesian Independence day on 17 August. During the Independence ceremony, the veranda is often used as a ceremonial stage for the President and dignitaries.\n\nNotable rooms in the Palace include:\n\n\nThe presidents after Sukarno no longer use the palace as a residence, although it is still the official presidential residence. The palace's offices are still in use by the current Indonesian president. During the Suharto administration, Suharto preferred to reside in his own house at Jalan Cendana, Menteng, while the palace and Bina Graha only served as his office. The palace once again became the official presidential residence during the Abdurrahman Wahid and Megawati administrations. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono sometimes resides in Merdeka Palace, however just like Suharto, he often prefers to reside in his own house, at Puri Cikeas, Cibubur, south of Jakarta.\n\nSince 17 July 2016, the changing of the guard ceremony by the Paspampres has been opened to the public. It is held at 8 am on every last Sunday of the month in front of the palace yard.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "410857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=410857", "title": "Monody", "text": "Monody\n\nIn poetry, the term monody has become specialized to refer to a poem in which one person laments another's death. (In the context of ancient Greek literature, monody, could simply refer to lyric poetry sung by a single performer, rather than by a chorus.)\n\nIn music, monody refers to a solo vocal style distinguished by having a single melodic line and instrumental accompaniment. Although such music is found in various cultures throughout history, the term is specifically applied to Italian song of the early 17th century, particularly the period from about 1600 to 1640. The term is used both for the style and for individual songs (so one can speak both of monody as a whole as well as a particular monody). The term itself is a recent invention of scholars. No composer of the 17th century ever called a piece a monody. Compositions in monodic form might be called madrigals, motets, or even concertos (in the earlier sense of \"concertato\", meaning \"with instruments\").\n\nIn monody, which developed out of an attempt by the Florentine Camerata in the 1580s to restore ancient Greek ideas of melody and declamation (probably with little historical accuracy), one solo voice sings a melodic part, usually with considerable ornamentation, over a rhythmically independent bass line. Accompanying instruments could be lute, chitarrone, theorbo, harpsichord, organ, and even on occasion guitar. While some monodies were arrangements for smaller forces of the music for large ensembles which was common at the end of the 16th century, especially in the Venetian School, most monodies were composed independently. The development of monody was one of the defining characteristics of early Baroque practice, as opposed to late Renaissance style, in which groups of voices sang independently and with a greater balance between parts.\n\nOther musical streams which came together in the monody were the madrigal and the motet, both of which developed into solo forms after 1600 and borrowed ideas from the monody.\n\nContrasting passages in monodies could be more melodic or more declamatory: these two styles of presentation eventually developed into the aria and the recitative, and the overall form merged with the cantata by about 1635.\n\nThe parallel development of solo song with accompaniment in France was called the \"air de cour\": the term monody is not normally applied to these more conservative songs, however, which retained many musical characteristics of the Renaissance \"chanson\".\n\nAn important early treatise on monody is contained in Giulio Caccini's song collection, \"Le nuove musiche\" (Florence, 1601).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2387895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2387895", "title": "Music publisher (popular music)", "text": "Music publisher (popular music)\n\nIn the music industry, a music publisher (or publishing company) is responsible for ensuring the songwriters and composers receive payment when their compositions are used commercially. Through an agreement called a publishing contract, a songwriter or composer \"assigns\" the copyright of their composition to a publishing company. In return, the company licenses compositions, helps monitor where compositions are used, collects royalties and distributes them to the composers. They also secure commissions for music and promote existing compositions to recording artists, film and television.\n\nThe copyrights owned and administered by publishing companies are one of the most important forms of intellectual property in the music industry. (The other is the copyright on a master recording which is typically owned by a record company) Publishing companies play a central role in managing this vital asset.\n\nSuccessful songwriters and composers have a relationship with a publishing company defined by a publishing contract. Publishers also sometimes provide substantial advances against future income. In return, the publishing company receives a percentage, which can be as high as 50% and varies for different kinds of royalty.\n\nThere are several types of royalty: mechanical royalties derive from the sale of recorded music, such as CDs or digital downloads. These royalties are paid to publishers by record companies (through the Harry Fox Agency as well as through American Mechanical Rights Agency in the U.S.). Performance royalties are collected by performance rights organizations such as SESAC, BMI, ASCAP or PRS and are paid by radio stations and others who broadcast recorded music; and are paid by venues, event organizers for live performances of the compositions. Synchronization royalties are required when a composition is used in a film or television soundtrack. These royalties typically pass through the hands of a music publisher before they reach the composer.\n\nPublishers also work to link up new songs by songwriters with suitable recording artists to record them and to place writers' songs in other media such as movie soundtracks and commercials. They will typically also handle copyright registration and \"ownership\" matters for the composer. Music print publishers also supervise the issue of songbooks and sheet music by their artists.\n\nTraditionally, music publishing royalties are split seventy/thirty, with thirty percent going to the publisher (as payment for their services) and the rest going to the songwriter – or songwriters, as the case may be. Other arrangements have been made in the past, and continue to be; some better for the writers, some better for the publishers. Occasionally a recording artist will ask for a co-writer's credit on a song (thus sharing in both the artist and publishing royalties) in exchange for selecting it to perform, particularly if the writer is not well known. Sometimes an artist's manager or producer will expect a co-credit or share of the publishing (as with Norman Petty and Phil Spector), and occasionally a publisher will insist on writer's credit (as Morris Levy did with several of his acts); these practices are listed in ascending order of scrupulousness, as regarded by the music industry.\n\nThe most unscrupulous type of music publisher is the songshark, who does little if any real \"legwork\" or promotion on behalf of songwriters. Songsharks make their profit not on royalties from sales, but by charging inexperienced writers for \"services\" (some real, such as demo recording or musical arranging, some fictional, such as \"audition\" or \"review\" fees) a legitimate publisher would provide without cost to the writer, as part of their job. (By comparison, a bona fide publisher who charges admission to a workshop for writers, where songs may be auditioned or reviewed, isn't wrong to do so.)\n\nRock-n-roll pioneer Buddy Holly split with longtime manager Norman Petty over publishing matters in late 1958, as did the Buckinghams with producer James William Guercio almost a decade later. John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival was sued by his former publisher Saul Zaentz (who'd also served as his manager) over a later Fogerty song that sounded slightly like a CCR song Zaentz published. (Fogerty won in court.)\n\nSeveral bands and artists own (or later purchase) their own publishing, and start their own companies, with or without help from an outside agent. The sale or loss of publishing ownership can be devastating to a given artist or writer, financially and emotionally. R&B legend Little Richard was largely cheated on his music publishing and copyrights, as were many performers. Brian Wilson and Mike Love of The Beach Boys were crushed to learn that Murry Wilson (father to three of the Beach Boys, Love's uncle, and the band's music publisher) had sold their company Sea of Tunes to A&M Records during 1969 for a fraction of what it was worth – or earned in the following years.\n\nA large factor in the Beatles' breakup was when their publisher Dick James sold his share of Northern Songs, the company they'd formed with him in 1963 (then taken public in 1967, with shares trading on the London Stock Exchange), to Britain's Associated TeleVision (ATV) in 1969. Neither the Beatles nor managers Lee Eastman and Allen Klein were able to prevent ATV from becoming majority stockholders in Northern Songs, whose assets included virtually all the group's song copyrights. Losing control of the company, John Lennon and Paul McCartney elected to sell their share of Northern Songs (and thus their own copyrights), while retaining their writer's royalties. (George Harrison and Ringo Starr retained minority holdings in the company.)\n\n\n"}

It operated from 1897 to 1928, and encouraged classical academic studies and liberal arts. \n\nIt was formed to provide support to classic scholarship, in contrast to Booker T. Washington's approach to education. Washington's Tuskegee University emphasized vocational and industrial training for southern blacks, as he thought this was more practical for the lives most would live in the segregated South, where most blacks lived in rural areas. \n\nThe founders of the ANA were primarily authors, scholars, and artists. They included Alexander Crummell, an Episcopal priest and Republican from New York City; John Wesley Cromwell of Washington, DC; Paul Laurence Dunbar, poet and writer in Washington; Walter B. Hayson, and Kelly Miller. Crummell served as the first president.\n\nTheir first meeting on March 5, 1897 included eighteen members:\n\n\nThe Academy was organized in 1897 in Washington, D.C. Black newspapers expressed excitement that the Academy would have wide possibilities to serve a large audience, seeking to elevate the race through educational enlightenment. Through an assessment of statistical tends, mainly concerning black illiteracy, the Academy-based its work that was to then be published in its Occasional Papers. The scholarly contributions aided the spirit of blacks who were being forced into legal segregation in southern states.\n\nThe Academy generally held an annual meeting of one-two days at the Lincoln Memorial Church in Washington, D.C. A public audience was invited to attend all but the Academy's business meetings, reserved solely for members. The schedule would occupy the entire day. Reports were presented by the Academy's secretary and treasurer. During this time, new membership applications to the Academy were considered, as well as discussions on current business. In the evening, an annual address was delivered. For example, W.E.B. Du Bois presented the Academy's second annual address. A presentation of a paper would follow. The following day, after several paper presentations, discussions took place. Discussions centered around the efficacy of a scholar's musings. In order to distribute the works of various Academy members, copies were available upon requests made directly to the Academy's secretary, or through newspaper requests.\n\nThe ANA took its turn in the struggle for equal rights for blacks. It was organized shortly after the United States Supreme Court had upheld the principle of \"separate but equal\" in the 1896 case, \"Plessy v. Ferguson.\" \n\nDu Bois suggested that a Talented Tenth of African Americans, primarily composed of blacks trained in classical higher education, could lead in educating masses of black citizens. Most of the latter would work in rural or unskilled jobs; in the South they suffered second-class status. Through a publication of works among the Academy's Occasional Papers, the group wanted to expand the reach of its scholarship, and to aid black intellectuals' efforts having influence on “his schools, academies and colleges; and then enters his pulpits; and so filters down into his families and his homes…to be a laborer with intelligence, enlightenment and manly ambitions”.\n\nScholars have disputed the influence of the Academy. Dr. Alfred A. Moss Jr. argued for its efficacy in \"The American Negro Academy: Voice of the Talented Tenth\". In his analysis of a collection of private letters written by Crummell, Moss explains that nearly from the beginning, the Academy was bound to become fully defunct. The organization was unable to consistently organize; it struggled to recruit new members, and to raise scholarship funds for educational uplift of more students.

It was destroyed by fire in 1856 and rebuilt as the New Royal Pavilion Theatre.\n\nThe theatre was opened in 1828 on the site of a former factory, and was the first major theatre to open in London's East End. The first managers were William Wyatt and John Farrell.\n\nThe first Pavilion Theatre was entirely destroyed by fire on 13 February 1856, and was rebuilt in 1858 as the New Royal Pavilion Theatre, with a capacity of 3,500. It was further reconstructed in 1871 by the architect J. T. Robinson, and the capacity increased to 4,000. Charles Dickens, Jr. (eldest child of Charles Dickens), in his 1879 book \"Dickens's Dictionary of London\", described the Pavilion this way: \"A large East-end theatre capable of holding considerably over 3,000 persons. Melodrama of a rough type, farce, pantomime, &c.\"\n\nIn the early 20th century it became the home of Yiddish theatre, catering to the large Jewish population of the area, and gave birth to the Anglo-Jewish 'Whitechapel Boys' avant-garde literary and artistic movement.\n\nIn later years, it operated under the names, Royal Clarence Theatre, Eastern Opera House, and New Royal Pavilion Theatre, continuing in business until 1935.

For each competition, entrants had to submit their designs for a car. A model of the winning design was built by the Peugeot Styling Centre and unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The last competition took place in 2008.\n\nThe first contest took place in 2000-2001, with the theme \"2020\" - a challenge to design a Peugeot car for the year 2020. The contest was announced at the Paris Motor Show in 2000, and culminated in the winning design being built by Peugeot, and unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2001. Since then, the contest has followed a similar schedule every two years. For the 2006-2007 contest, the winning design featured in an Xbox 360 game.\n\nEach contest has a theme, which contestants must follow when creating their designs:\n\nThe contest runs to a similar schedule, with similar rules, each year. In 2008, the contest opened in June, with the deadline for submissions on July 20. When the deadline for submissions has passed, Peugeot selects 30 entries to go forward to the next stage. These 30 entries are placed on the competition's website and are voted on by visitors to the site and selected industry and press figures. Based on these votes, these 30 entries are narrowed down to ten entries and these entries are posted to the website. This stage is not a majority vote - the ten entries which are selected may not be the highest-voted entries.\n\nIn the final stage of voting, the Peugeot Jury select the winner and 2nd and 3rd runners-up from the final ten. The results of this are then posted to the competition's website, usually some time in February.\nIn the 2008-2009 contest, the prize structure will be as follows:\nThe winner of the 2000-2001 competition was \"Moonster\" by Marko Lukovic. The concept behind this design was that the vehicle should be totally original. It features a wheel-level engine with a raised central compartment capable of seating two people.\nThis contest, themed \"Retrofuturism\", was won by Stefan Schulze with \"4002\". With this design, the artist intended to make the car look like a typical Peugeot. Many commentators felt that he was successful with this, citing the design of the headlights as particularly Peugeot-like.\nThis contest was won by André Costa with \"Moovie\". His was an unusual design, almost totally enclosed by dark glass with few visible external features. The creator has stated that the car was designed to be environmentally friendly and ideal for use in cities.\nThe 2006-2007 competition was won by Mihai Panaitescu with his design, \"Flux\". According to its creator, the car is intended to be sporty and versatile, and able to handle many different environments with ease. \"Flux\" is meant to symbolise \"the continuous change and flow of our daily lives during work and play\" - to this end, the car contains an integrated Xbox 360 console.\n\n\n"}

The fairy promises to grant the boy a boon such as beauty, wealth or military success, but the king asks only that the fairy make the boy a good person. The fairy says she cannot change the boy's character, but she can give him advice and correct him when he errs.\n\nAfter the king's death, the fairy appears to Prince Darling, now the king, and gives him a magic ring that will prick his finger whenever he does wrong. Prince Darling continues to follow the instructions of his wise old mentor, Suleiman, but begins carousing at night with power-seeking sycophants who encourage his bad behaviour. Prince Darling meets a young shepherdess and arrogantly announces to her that he will marry her. Instead of being honoured, the shepherdess refuses because of Prince Darling's wicked reputation. The sycophants tell him that if he won't punish subjects who disobey him, his power will dissolve and the people will depose him. By this time Prince Darling has discarded the magic ring because it was almost constantly pricking him. So he puts the shepherdess in prison to force her consent to the marriage. When she mysteriously vanishes from her cell, the sycophants accuse Suleiman of freeing her, and that he is trying to undermine Prince Darling's authority and take over the kingdom. Prince Darling then imprisons Suleiman.\n\nAt this time the fairy of truth again appears to Prince Darling in a rage, saying that because he did not heed the ring's gentle correction he has become a monster. She transforms him into a beast with the body of a snake, the legs of a wolf, the head of a lion and the horns of a bull. The fairy tells him that as ugly as she can make him, his soul is still a hundred times more hideous. She disappears, and the creature is left alone in the woods to ruminate on the error of his ways.\n\nThe monster prince is captured by a hunter, who hopes to sell him as a curiosity. On the way back to the town, they encounter a reveller who says the whole town is rejoicing because Prince Darling is dead. He says the people have released Suleiman from prison and crowned him as the new king. Prince Darling sees this as a confirmation of everything his flattering friends said, and roars in rage. The hunter decides to take the monster to the new king as a coronation gift.\n\nThe hunter takes the monster prince to the coronation ceremony where they hear Suleiman announce that he is only taking the throne in trust for Prince Darling, who is not dead and will return one day. The hunter presents the monster to the king, who puts it in his menagerie. In his cage, Prince Darling observes that the animal keeper is a drunkard who abuses the animals. Prince Darling reflects that he was wrong about Suleiman, who only has his best interests in mind. He realizes that his friends were really the ones manipulating him and seeking power, and the prince resolves to do only good from now on. When the animal keeper has a near-fatal accident, the prince monster breaks out of his cage to save him. The Fairy of Truth appears momentarily, saying that good actions will be rewarded, and transforms him from the horrible monster into a dog.\n\nThe animal keeper takes the dog to King Suleiman to report that a miracle has happened. Suleiman's daughter takes a liking to the dog and decides to keep him herself. One morning the dog receives a spare breakfast of one dinner roll, which he takes out in the countryside. As he roams, he discovers a house of splendour, made of jewels. There are well-dressed people going into the building, but when they come out, they are thin and pale, wearing rags and apparently starving to death. One young girl crawling out of the palace passes the dog, and attempts to eat a blade of grass. The dog decides to give his roll to the girl. The girl tells the dog not to go in the house, because it is the Palace of Pleasure, and all the food is poisoned. The dog sees the shepherdess entering the palace and is desperate to save her. At this time, the Fairy of Truth appears and rewards his generosity by turning him into a dove. The dove prince flies around the palace, and through a window he sees the shepherdess, who suddenly vanishes in a puff of smoke. Resolving to find her, the dove flies all across the land. Eventually he spies her in a remote place, walking with an old beggar woman in rags. He flies down and lights on the shepherdess' finger, cooing. She remarks that it is the most beautiful dove in the world and that if it were a man, she would marry it. The beggar woman throws off her rags and reveals that she is the Fairy of Truth. She transforms the dove back into Prince Darling. The Prince kneels and begs the shepherdess for forgiveness. The fairy declares that the girl had always loved the prince, but didn't like his bad behaviour. Prince Darling and the shepherdess are then married, and Prince Darling resumes the throne to become a just and beloved ruler.\n"}

By April 30 of each year, the USTR must identify countries which do not provide \"adequate and effective\" protection of intellectual property rights or \"fair and equitable market access to United States persons that rely upon intellectual property rights\".\n\nThe Special 301 Report is published pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (, ) as amended by Section 1303 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The Special 301 Report was first published in 1989. \n\nBy statute, the annual Special 301 Report includes a list of \"Priority Foreign Countries\", that are judged to have inadequate intellectual property laws; these countries may be subject to sanctions. In addition, the report contains a \"Priority Watch List\" and a \"Watch List\", containing countries whose intellectual property regimes are deemed of concern.\n\nThe Special 301 Sub-Committee of the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) advises the United States Trade Representative on which countries to designate as \"priority foreign countries\" or to include in the watchlists. The Special 301 Sub-Committee is chaired by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and its members include the Department of Commerce, the Patent and Trademark Office, the Department of State, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, the Copyright Office, the Council of Economic Advisers, and other agencies. U.S. companies provide extensive comments in the annual National Trade Estimate Report. The Special 301 Sub-Committee also takes the views of foreign governments and the views of U.S. embassies on intellectual property rights.\n\nU.S. companies and intellectual property owners, including copyrights, patents and trademarks, can submit complaints (ie., a petition alleging that a country has violated an international agreement with the United States that adversely affects the company or industry) to the Trade Compliance Centre, which provides a template for such complaints, or the country or industry desk at the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The ITA then reviews trade-related complaints with co-operation from the Office of General Counsel and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The complaint cannot be in relation to disputes between companies on intellectual property rights, but must be about instances where a country has violated an international agreement with the United States. Complaints can be made in relation to the intellectual property law of the country, judicial or administrative procedures that discriminate against the US company, and failure to enforce intellectual property laws, particularly in relation to trade in counterfeit goods, and lately online copyright infringement. Complaints do not need to reference specific international agreements or provisions that are being breached. Complaints will focus on a country's failure to protect the intellectual property rights of a US company or lack of intellectual property rights relates market access. Complaints are expected to include a description of the efforts the company has made to enforce its intellectual property rights in that country and provide estimates of economic losses resulting from the infringement of intellectual property rights in that country.\n\nMost countries included in the \"Priority Watch List\" and \"Watch List\" between 1996 and 2000 were requested by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) or the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA). According to Andres Guadamuz of the University of Edinburgh, the IIPA, which represents the U.S. media industry, urged the U.S. government to consider countries like Indonesia, Brazil, and India for inclusion in the Special 301 Watchlist in early 2010 because they either mandated or suggested the use of open-source software.\n\nIn 2010, NGOs such as PhRMA, Oxfam, and MSF made submissions to the USTR.\n\nA \"Priority Foreign Country\" is the worst classification given to \"\"foreign countries that deny \"adequate and effective\" protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) or \"fair and equitable market access\" to U.S. persons relying upon IPR protection\"\" under the Trade Act. \n\nOn 13 March 2001, the United States Trade Representative designated Ukraine as a Priority Foreign Country citing the massive amounts of unlicensed CDs sold in Europe that originate in the Ukraine. In 2011 and 2012, no countries were classified as a Priority Foreign Country; however, Paraguay was made subject to Section 306 Monitoring. In 2013, Ukraine was redesignated as a Priority Foreign Country. In 2014, the US was in talks with the WTO to designate India as a \"Priority Foreign Country\" especially for the pharmaceutical sector.\n\nUnder the amended Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 the USTR must by April 30 of each year:\n\n\"identify (1) those foreign countries that (A) deny adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights, or (B) deny fair and equitable markets access to United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection, and (2) those foreign countries identified under paragraph (1) that are determined by the Trade Representative to be priority foreign countries\".\n\nThe Act defines \"priority foreign countries\" as: \n\n\"those foreign countries - (A) that have the most onerous or egregious acts, policies, or practices that (i) deny adequate and effective intellectual property rights, or (ii) deny fair and equitable market access to United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection, (B) whose acts, policies, or practices described in subparagraph (A) have the greatest adverse impact (actual or potential) on the relevant United States products, and (C) that are not (i) entering into good faith negotiations, or (ii) making significant progress in bilateral or multilateral negotiations to provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights\".\nThe Uruguay Round Agreement Act furthermore states that countries may be identified under Special 301 \"taking into account the history of intellectual property laws and practices of the foreign country, including any previous identifications\" and \"the history of efforts of the United States, and the response of the foreign country, to achieve adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights\". It also states that compliance with the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) does not preclude a country from being identified as denying \"adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights\".\n\nThe USTR acts on the information available at the time and can identify new \"priority foreign countries\" on an annual basis. The Special 301 Sub-Committee conducts additional reviews throughout the year for countries that \"merit additional monitoring\". The Trade Act of 1974 requires that the USTR to start investigations within 30 days of a country being identified as \"priority foreign country\", unless the USTR concludes that such an investigation \"would be detrimental to United States economic interests\". Unless the \"priority foreign country\" is regarded as being in breach of a trade agreement, including the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), investigations must conclude within six months, with the possibility of a three-month extension. Reasons for extension include \"substantial progress in drafting or implementing legislative or administrative measures that will provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights\" by the \"priority foreign country\". If the USTR believes that a trade agreement is being breached the USTR must conclude the investigation within 18 months, or within 30 days after the \"dispute settlement procedure\" has finished. If the USTR concludes that a trade agreement is being breached, \"retaliation actions\" may be taken under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.\n\nTwo non-statutory categories have been created in addition to the statutory category of \"priority foreign country\", which once identified as such needs to be investigated and if found in breach with a trade agreement is subject to possible \"retaliation actions\" under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. \"Priority Watch List\" and \"Watch List\" countries are identified by the annual Special 301 Report. \"Priority Watchlist countries\" are judged by the USTR as having \"serious intellectual property rights deficiencies\" that require increased USTR attention. \"Watch List\" countries have been identified by the USTR as having \"serious intellectual property rights deficiencies\" but are not yet placed on the \"Priority Watchlist\". The USTR can move countries from one list to the other, or remove them from the lists, throughout the year.\n\nThe International Intellectual Property Alliance keeps these statistics since 1989.\n\nIn response to countries being included on the Special 301 Report Watchlists the U.S. government may initiate dispute settlement proceedings at the World Trade Organization (WTO) or other relevant trade agreement, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The U.S. government can also eliminate tariff preferences unilaterally granted, such as the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).\n\nIf an USTR investigation concludes that a country has violated a trade agreement Section 301 allows the U.S. government to impose unilateral trade sanctions if the country is not a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) or any other trade agreement establishing dispute settlement provisions, such as free trade agreements, which are relevant to the alleged violation. Unilateral trade sanctions under section 301 were imposed on December 20, 2001, on Ukraine, which was not yet a WTO member, by imposing a prohibitive tariff on metals, footwear, and other imports because the USTR concluded that the country had failed to enact legislation to enforce copyright in relation to music CDs and their export. Section 301 was also invoked by President Trump in March 2018, setting off the 2018 China–United States trade dispute.\n\nAccording to the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) the Special 301 Report and the Watchlists is used to pressure other nations to adopt stricter copyright laws and take a more active role in combating copyright infringement.\n\nThe USTR has used the Special 301 Reports to initiate formal dispute settlement proceedings at the World Trade Organization (WTO) if it believes a country does not comply with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). WTO dispute settlement proceedings are initiated when the country's noncompliance with TRIPS is judged to be too narrow to make the country a \"priority foreign country\". The countries against which the USTR intends to pursue dispute settlement proceedings are announced every April in the Special 301 Report.\n\nPeter Drahos, a law professor at the Centre for Commercial Law Studies at Queen Mary University of London's School of Law, has called the Special 301 Report \"a public law devoted to the service of private corporate interests\". It explicitly protects and acts in favor of U.S. intellectual property owners, most often large corporations, against any foreign national policy or unofficial action that does not conform, even in its domestic legislation, to the United States' position on international copyright and IP. Threat of action under Special 301 has been used to insert U.S. trade lobby backed advisers into states' domestic legislative process in order to ensure compliance with U.S. trade norms. One of the most direct examples comes from a former U.S. trade lobbyist, speaking in 1993:\n\n\"Jamaica had no intellectual property law, but they wrote one (with our help). Similarly the Dominican Republic. I sat down with their lawyer and together we wrote their copyright law.\" \n\nSuch methods of drafting national-level legislation inevitably raise questions about undue influence from the private sector. Lobbyists for the IP industry have been successful in their efforts to secure legal backing in foreign countries to already existing regimes such as TRIPS, and private corporations are now able to act as watchdogs to foreign national legislation on behalf of the U.S. government.\n\nMost countries included in the \"Priority Watch List\" and \"Watch List\" between 1996 and 2000 were requested by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or International Intellectual Property Alliance. For example, Finland was blacklisted in retaliation to unanimously adopted legislation requiring the tax-funded Social Insurance Institution to reimburse the cost of medications only up to the price of the cheapest generic. Intellectual property is not violated, as this affects all manufacturers equally; nevertheless, this retaliatory measure has had a negative impact on investment decisions unrelated to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\n"}

He listed as his source Francis Hindes Groome's \"In Gypsy Tents\", where the informant was John Roberts, a Welsh gypsy.\n\nA version of this tale appears in by Ruth Manning-Sanders, under the title \"An Old King and His Three Sons of England\".\n\nAn old king could be cured only by golden apples from a far country. His three sons set out to find them, and parted ways at a crossroads. The youngest son found a house in a forest, where an old man greeted him as a king's son, and told him to put his horse in the stable and have something to eat. After the meal, he asked how the man knew he was a king's son, and the man said he knew many things, including what the prince was doing. He told the prince that he had to stay there the night, though many snakes and toads would crawl over him, and if he stirred, he would turn into one himself.\n\nThe prince got little sleep but did not stir. In the morning, the old man gave him breakfast, a new horse, and a ball of yarn to throw between the horse's ears. When the prince threw it and chased it, he came to the old man's brother, who was uglier than the first one. He received the same hospitality, and the same unpleasant night, and this brother sent him on to the third brother.\n\nAt the third brother's, the brother, who was even uglier than the second one, told him he must go on to a castle. There, he must tell swans to bear him over the lake to a castle. It was guarded by giants, lions, and dragons, but they would be asleep, and so he must go in at one o'clock and come out again by two. He must go through some grand rooms, go down into the kitchen, and then go out into the garden. There he must pick the apples. He should come back the same way, and when riding off, never look back because they would pursue him into he nearly reached the old man's house.\n\nHe went to bed, and this time the brother assured him that nothing would disturb him, and nothing did. In the morning, the old man warned him not to tarry because of a beautiful woman.\n\nHe reached the castle by the swans and saw a beautiful woman there. He exchanged his garter, gold watch, and pocket-handkerchief for hers, and kissed her. Then he got the apples and had to flee with all speed, because the hour was nearly up, but he escaped.\n\nThe old man brought him to a well and insisted that the prince cut his head off and throw it into the well. This turned him into a young, handsome man, and the house into a palace. At the second brother's, he received a new bed, with no snakes or toads, and cut off his head as well, and then same with the first.\n\nHe met up with his brothers again. They stole his apples and put others in their place, and went on before him. When he reached home, his apples were not as good as his brother's, and his father thought they were poisoned and told his headsman to cut his head off. The headsman instead took him into the woods and left him there. A bear came up to him, and he climbed a tree, but the bear persuaded him to come down. The bear brought him to some tents, where they made him welcome, and changed in a handsome young man, Jubal. He stayed with them and was happy, although he had lost the golden watch somewhere. One day, he saw it in the tree where he had climbed to hide from the bear, and climbed it to get it again.\n\nMeanwhile, the princess, realizing one of the king's sons had been there, set out with an army. When she reached the king, she demanded to see his sons. When the oldest came, he said he had been to her castle, but when she threw down the handkerchief and he walked over it, he broke his leg; then the second brother said the same, but also broke his leg. She demanded of the king whether he had more sons; the king sent to the headsman, who confessed he had not killed the prince, and the king said he must find him, to save the king's life. They found Jubal, who pointed to the tree where the prince was, and they told the prince he must come because a lady was looking for him, and they brought Jubal with them. He did not break his leg over the handkerchief, and the princess knew he was the prince, so they married, and went back to her castle.\n\nJacobs noted the king with three sons was a common motif, and that the Sleeping Beauty is found in Perrault.\n\n"}

He filled the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard from 1956 to 1978. A 2009 poll conducted among analytic philosophers named Quine as the fifth most important philosopher of the past two centuries. He won the first Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy in 1993 for \"his systematical and penetrating discussions of how learning of language and communication are based on socially available evidence and of the consequences of this for theories on knowledge and linguistic meaning.\" In 1996 he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy for his \"outstanding contributions to the progress of philosophy in the 20th century by proposing numerous theories based on keen insights in logic, epistemology, philosophy of science and philosophy of language.\"\n\nQuine falls squarely into the analytic philosophy tradition while also being the main proponent of the view that philosophy is not conceptual analysis but the abstract branch of the empirical sciences. His major writings include \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" (1951), which attacked the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions and advocated a form of semantic holism, and \"Word and Object\" (1960), which further developed these positions and introduced Quine's famous indeterminacy of translation thesis, advocating a behaviorist theory of meaning. He also developed an influential naturalized epistemology that tried to provide \"an improved scientific explanation of how we have developed elaborate scientific theories on the basis of meager sensory input.\" He is also important in philosophy of science for his \"systematic attempt to understand science from within the resources of science itself\" and for his conception of philosophy as continuous with science. This led to his famous quip that \"philosophy of science is philosophy enough.\" In philosophy of mathematics, he and his Harvard colleague Hilary Putnam developed the \"Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis,\" an argument for the reality of mathematical entities.\n\nAccording to his autobiography, \"The Time of My Life\" (1986), Quine grew up in Akron, Ohio, where he lived with his parents and older brother Robert Cloyd. His father, Cloyd Robert, was a manufacturing entrepreneur (founder of the Akron Equipment Company, which produced tire molds) and his mother, Harriett E., was a schoolteacher and later a housewife. He received his B.A. in mathematics from Oberlin College in 1930, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard University in 1932. His thesis supervisor was Alfred North Whitehead. He was then appointed a Harvard Junior Fellow, which excused him from having to teach for four years. During the academic year 1932–33, he travelled in Europe thanks to a Sheldon fellowship, meeting Polish logicians (including Stanislaw Lesniewski and Alfred Tarski) and members of the Vienna Circle (including Rudolf Carnap), as well as the logical positivist A. J. Ayer.\n\nIt was Quine who arranged for Tarski to be invited to the September 1939 Unity of Science Congress in Cambridge, for which Tarski sailed on the last ship to leave Danzig before the Third Reich invaded Poland. Tarski survived the war and worked another 44 years in the US.\n\nDuring World War II, Quine lectured on logic in Brazil, in Portuguese, and served in the United States Navy in a military intelligence role, deciphering messages from German submarines, and reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.\n\nAt Harvard, Quine helped supervise the Harvard graduate theses of, among others, David Lewis, Daniel Dennett, Gilbert Harman, Dagfinn Føllesdal, Hao Wang, Hugues LeBlanc, Henry Hiz and George Myro. For the academic year 1964–1965, Quine was a fellow on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University. In 1980\nQuine received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Humanities at Uppsala University, Sweden.\n\nQuine was an atheist when he was a teenager.\n\nHe had four children by two marriages. Guitarist Robert Quine was his nephew.\n\nIn the foreword to the new edition of \"Word and Object\", Quine's student Dagfinn Føllesdal noted that Quine began to lose his memory toward the end of his life. The deterioration of his short-term memory was so severe that he struggled to continue following arguments. Quine also had considerable difficulty in his project to make the desired revisions to \"Word and Object.\" Before passing away, Quine noted to Morton White, \"I do not remember what my illness is called, Althusser or Alzheimer, but since I cannot remember it, it must be Alzheimer.\" He passed away from the illness on Christmas Day in 2000.\n\nQuine was politically conservative, but the bulk of his writing was in technical areas of philosophy removed from direct political issues. He did, however, write in defense of several conservative positions: for example, in \"Quiddities: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary\", he wrote a defense of moral censorship; while, in his autobiography, he made some criticisms of American postwar academic culture.\n\nQuine's Ph.D. thesis and early publications were on formal logic and set theory. Only after World War II did he, by virtue of seminal papers on ontology, epistemology and language, emerge as a major philosopher. By the 1960s, he had worked out his \"naturalized epistemology\" whose aim was to answer all substantive questions of knowledge and meaning using the methods and tools of the natural sciences. Quine roundly rejected the notion that there should be a \"first philosophy\", a theoretical standpoint somehow prior to natural science and capable of justifying it. These views are intrinsic to his naturalism.\n\nQuine could lecture in French, Spanish, Portuguese and German, as well as his native English.\n\nLike the logical positivists, Quine evinced little interest in the philosophical canon: only once did he teach a course in the history of philosophy, on Hume.\n\nIn the 1930s and 40s, discussions with Rudolf Carnap, Nelson Goodman and Alfred Tarski, among others, led Quine to doubt the tenability of the distinction between \"analytic\" statements—those true simply by the meanings of their words, such as \"All bachelors are unmarried\"—and \"synthetic\" statements, those true or false by virtue of facts about the world, such as \"There is a cat on the mat.\" This distinction was central to logical positivism. Although Quine is not normally associated with verificationism, some philosophers believe the tenet is not incompatible with his general philosophy of language, citing his Harvard colleague B. F. Skinner and his analysis of language in \"Verbal Behavior\".\n\nLike other Analytic philosophers before him, Quine accepted the definition of \"analytic\" as \"true in virtue of meaning alone\". Unlike them, however, he concluded that ultimately the definition was circular. In other words, Quine accepted that analytic statements are those that are true by definition, then argued that the notion of truth by definition was unsatisfactory. \n\nQuine's chief objection to analyticity is with the notion of synonymy (sameness of meaning), a sentence being analytic, just in case it substitutes a synonym for one \"black\" in a proposition like \"All black things are black\" (or any other logical truth). The objection to synonymy hinges upon the problem of collateral information. We intuitively feel that there is a distinction between \"All unmarried men are bachelors\" and \"There have been black dogs\", but a competent English speaker will assent to both sentences under all conditions since such speakers also have access to \"collateral information\" bearing on the historical existence of black dogs. Quine maintains that there is no distinction between universally known collateral information and conceptual or analytic truths.\n\nAnother approach to Quine's objection to analyticity and synonymy emerges from the modal notion of logical possibility. A traditional Wittgensteinian view of meaning held that each meaningful sentence was associated with a region in the space of possible worlds. Quine finds the notion of such a space problematic, arguing that there is no distinction between those truths which are universally and confidently believed and those which are necessarily true.\n\nThe central theses underlying the indeterminacy of translation and other extensions of Quine's work are ontological relativity and the related doctrine of confirmation holism. The premise of confirmation holism is that all theories (and the propositions derived from them) are under-determined by empirical data (data, sensory-data, evidence); although some theories are not justifiable, failing to fit with the data or being unworkably complex, there are many equally justifiable alternatives. While the Greeks' assumption that (unobservable) Homeric gods exist is false, and our supposition of (unobservable) electromagnetic waves is true, both are to be justified solely by their ability to explain our observations.\n\nQuine concluded his \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" as follows:\n\nAs an empiricist I continue to think of the conceptual scheme of science as a tool, ultimately, for predicting future experience in the light of past experience. Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer . . . For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.\nQuine's ontological relativism (evident in the passage above) led him to agree with Pierre Duhem that for any collection of empirical evidence, there would always be many theories able to account for it. However, Duhem's holism is much more restricted and limited than Quine's. For Duhem, underdetermination applies only to physics or possibly to natural science, while for Quine it applies to all of human knowledge. Thus, while it is possible to verify or falsify whole theories, it is not possible to verify or falsify individual statements. Almost any particular statement can be saved, given sufficiently radical modifications of the containing theory. For Quine, scientific thought forms a coherent web in which any part could be altered in the light of empirical evidence, and in which no empirical evidence could force the revision of a given part.\n\nThe problem of non-referring names is an old puzzle in philosophy, which Quine captured when he wrote,\n\nA curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity. It can be put into three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables: 'What is there?' It can be answered, moreover, in a word—'Everything'—and everyone will accept this answer as true.\n\nMore directly, the controversy goes,\n\nHow can we talk about Pegasus? To what does the word 'Pegasus' refer? If our answer is, 'Something,' then we seem to believe in mystical entities; if our answer is, 'nothing', then we seem to talk about nothing and what sense can be made of this? Certainly when we said that Pegasus was a mythological winged horse we make sense, and moreover we speak the truth! If we speak the truth, this must be truth \"about something\". So we cannot be speaking of nothing.\n\nQuine resists the temptation to say that non-referring terms are meaningless for reasons made clear above. Instead he tells us that we must first determine whether our terms refer or not before we know the proper way to understand them. However, Czesław Lejewski criticizes this belief for reducing the matter to empirical discovery when it seems we should have a formal distinction between referring and non-referring terms or elements of our domain. Lejewski writes further,\n\nThis state of affairs does not seem to be very satisfactory. The idea that some of our rules of inference should depend on empirical information, which may not be forthcoming, is so foreign to the character of logical inquiry that a thorough re-examination of the two inferences [existential generalization and universal instantiation] may prove worth our while.\n\nLejewski then goes on to offer a description of free logic, which he claims accommodates an answer to the problem.\n\nLejewski also points out that free logic additionally can handle the problem of the empty set for statements like formula_1. Quine had considered the problem of the empty set unrealistic, which left Lejewski unsatisfied.\n\nOver the course of his career, Quine published numerous technical and expository papers on formal logic, some of which are reprinted in his \"Selected Logic Papers\" and in \"The Ways of Paradox\".\n\nQuine confined logic to classical bivalent first-order logic, hence to truth and falsity under any (nonempty) universe of discourse. Hence the following were not logic for Quine:\n\nQuine wrote three undergraduate texts on formal logic:\n\n\"Mathematical Logic\" is based on Quine's graduate teaching during the 1930s and '40s. It shows that much of what \"Principia Mathematica\" took more than 1000 pages to say can be said in 250 pages. The proofs are concise, even cryptic. The last chapter, on Gödel's incompleteness theorem and Tarski's indefinability theorem, along with the article Quine (1946), became a launching point for Raymond Smullyan's later lucid exposition of these and related results.\n\nQuine's work in logic gradually became dated in some respects. Techniques he did not teach and discuss include analytic tableaux, recursive functions, and model theory. His treatment of metalogic left something to be desired. For example, \"Mathematical Logic\" does not include any proofs of soundness and completeness. Early in his career, the notation of his writings on logic was often idiosyncratic. His later writings nearly always employed the now-dated notation of \"Principia Mathematica\". Set against all this are the simplicity of his preferred method (as exposited in his \"Methods of Logic\") for determining the satisfiability of quantified formulas, the richness of his philosophical and linguistic insights, and the fine prose in which he expressed them.\n\nMost of Quine's original work in formal logic from 1960 onwards was on variants of his predicate functor logic, one of several ways that have been proposed for doing logic without quantifiers. For a comprehensive treatment of predicate functor logic and its history, see Quine (1976). For an introduction, see chpt. 45 of his \"Methods of Logic\".\n\nQuine was very warm to the possibility that formal logic would eventually be applied outside of philosophy and mathematics. He wrote several papers on the sort of Boolean algebra employed in electrical engineering, and with Edward J. McCluskey, devised the Quine–McCluskey algorithm of reducing Boolean equations to a minimum covering sum of prime implicants.\n\nWhile his contributions to logic include elegant expositions and a number of technical results, it is in set theory that Quine was most innovative. He always maintained that mathematics required set theory and that set theory was quite distinct from logic. He flirted with Nelson Goodman's nominalism for a while, but backed away when he failed to find a nominalist grounding of mathematics.\n\nOver the course of his career, Quine proposed three variants of axiomatic set theory, each including the axiom of extensionality:\n\nAll three set theories admit a universal class, but since they are free of any hierarchy of types, they have no need for a distinct universal class at each type level.\n\nQuine's set theory and its background logic were driven by a desire to minimize posits; each innovation is pushed as far as it can be pushed before further innovations are introduced. For Quine, there is but one connective, the Sheffer stroke, and one quantifier, the universal quantifier. All polyadic predicates can be reduced to one dyadic predicate, interpretable as set membership. His rules of proof were limited to modus ponens and substitution. He preferred conjunction to either disjunction or the conditional, because conjunction has the least semantic ambiguity. He was delighted to discover early in his career that all of first order logic and set theory could be grounded in a mere two primitive notions: abstraction and inclusion. For an elegant introduction to the parsimony of Quine's approach to logic, see his \"New Foundations for Mathematical Logic,\" ch. 5 in his \"From a Logical Point of View\".\n\nJust as he challenged the dominant analytic–synthetic distinction, Quine also took aim at traditional normative epistemology. According to Quine, traditional epistemology tried to justify the sciences, but this effort (as exemplified by Rudolf Carnap) failed, and so we should replace traditional epistemology with an empirical study of what sensory inputs produce what theoretical outputs: \"Epistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a natural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject is accorded a certain experimentally controlled input — certain patterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for instance — and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as output a description of the three-dimensional external world and its history. The relation between the meager input and the torrential output is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the same reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to see how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one's theory of nature transcends any available evidence...But a conspicuous difference between old epistemology and the epistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting is that we can now make free use of empirical psychology.\" (Quine, 1969: 82–3)\n\nQuine's proposal is controversial among contemporary philosophers and has several critics, with Jaegwon Kim the most prominent among them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
