Leonetti, written by Gary Dauberman and produced by Peter Safran and James Wan. It is a prequel to 2013's \"The Conjuring\" and the second installment in The Conjuring Universe. The film was inspired by a story of a doll named Annabelle told by Ed and Lorraine Warren. The film stars Annabelle Wallis, Ward Horton, and Alfre Woodard.\n\n\"Annabelle\" premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on September 29, 2014, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 3, 2014. The film received generally negative reviews from critics but was a box office success, grossing over $257million against its $6.5million production budget. A prequel, titled \"\", was released on August 11, 2017. A currently untitled sequel will be released on July 3, 2019.\n\nIn 1967 in Santa Monica, CA, John Form, a doctor, presents his expectant wife Mia with a rare vintage porcelain doll as a gift for their first child to be placed in a collection of dolls in their daughter's nursery.\n\nThat night, the couple is disturbed by the sounds of their next door neighbors, the Higgins, being murdered during a home invasion. While Mia calls the police, she and John are attacked by the Higgins' killers. The police arrive and shoot one killer, a man, dead while the female killer commits suicide by slitting her own throat inside the nursery while holding the porcelain doll. News reports identify the assailants as the Higgins' estranged daughter, Annabelle, and her unidentified boyfriend, both members of a cult.\n\nIn the days following the attack, a series of paranormal activities occur around the Form's residence. Afterwards, Mia gives birth to a healthy baby girl. She and John name their child Leah. The family rents an apartment in Pasadena and, after finding the doll that John had discarded since Annabelle's previous attack in one of their boxes, another set of paranormal events plagues Mia and her daughter. The next night, Mia is haunted by a malevolent presence in her apartment and believes it to be Annabelle's ghost. During a storm, Mia encounters an enigmatic figure in the building's basement who begins pursuing her before she escapes.\n\nMia calls back Detective Clarkin to gather information about Annabelle and the cultist and learns that the cult intends to summon supernatural beings. With the help of bookseller and fellow tenant Evelyn, Mia realizes that the cult practiced devil worship, which summoned a demon who followed the family after they moved to their apartment in order to claim a soul. Upon returning home, Mia and Leah are attacked by the demon who reveals itself while manipulating the doll. Mia and John contact their parish priest, Father Perez, who informs them that demons sometimes attach themselves to inanimate objects as an advantage to accomplish their goals and that a human soul must be offered for a purpose. Without any hopes of exorcising the demon out of the doll, Father Perez decides to take it away to seek help from the Warrens for investigation. But before he can enter the church, the demon impersonating Annabelle's spirit attacks him and grabs the doll.\n\nThe priest is hospitalized on the next day and, when John checks on him, Father Perez warns the latter that after sensing its powerful presence, the demon's true intention is to claim Mia's soul. That night, while Evelyn is visiting Mia, the demon uses Father Perez's physical form to sneak into the apartment and abduct Leah in exchange for her mother's soul. To spare her daughter, Mia attempts to jump out of the window with the doll but John arrives in time along with Evelyn to stop her. Evelyn decides to take her own life in Mia's place instead as atonement for causing a car accident that resulted in the death of her daughter Ruby years ago. As the Forms are reunited, the demon and the doll disappear, while Leah is safely inside her crib.\n\nSix months later, the doll is bought from an antique shop by a mother as a gift for her daughter Debbie, one of the nursing students from the prelude of the first film.\n\nThe film is a spin-off of the 2013 horror film \"The Conjuring\", focusing on the origins of the Annabelle doll found in that film. The film was designed to be stand alone yet at the same time catering to fans of \"The Conjuring\" who would already be familiar with the latter film. According to Backstage.com, the film was one of the first in a new strategy by distributors Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema \"that capitalizes on the built-in fan bases for successful films, allowing for smaller budgets and production time with a bigger payout on the back end.\"\n\nCasting was announced in January 2014, with Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton playing the lead roles. with actors Eric Ladin, Brian Howe and Alfre Woodard also being announced that month.\n\nPrincipal photography began on January 27, 2014, at The Book Shop in Covina, California. On February 25, 2014, filming continued at an apartment in South Normandie Avenue in Los Angeles County, where the 55-member crew shot for several days. Director Leonetti and producer Safran told reporters that the \"Annabelle\" set was \"haunted\" and that they thought \"supernatural phenomena\" had occurred there. The film was shot in sequence so that the actors were always aware of their emotional arcs.\n\nOn April 24, 2014, Joseph Bishara was hired to compose the music for the film. WaterTower Music released the soundtrack album on September 30, 2014.\n\n\"Annabelle\" grossed $84.3million in North America and $172.8 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $257million, against a production budget of $6.5million. In the U.S. and Canada, \"Annabelle\" is the fourteenth highest-grossing horror/supernatural film. \n\nEarly tracking projected \"Annabelle\" would gross around $25–27million in its opening weekend. However, estimates declined shortly after to a range between $20–22million. \"Annabelle\" was released on October 3, 2014, in 3,185 theatres in North America. It topped the box office in its opening day earning $15.4million (including its $2.1million midnight previews). In its traditional three-day opening the film debuted at #2 at the box office with $37.1million, at an average of $11,659 per theater from 3,185 theaters after a neck-and-neck competition against \"Gone Girl\" which earned $37.5million. The two releases were separated by $378,854. Its opening weekend gross is the eleventh highest in October and the biggest for a horror genre film of 2014, surpassing \"\"s $28.9million opening. Dan Fellman, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros., said about the opening box office performance, \"we had a wonderful campaign for the film and a good date\"; she added \"being a spinoff of \"The Conjuring\" set it up really well and we just hit the right note.\" It is the second time that an October weekend has produced two $30million or more debuts; the first was in 2008: \"High School Musical 3\" ($42million) and \"Saw V\" ($31million). According to Rentrak, the opening weekend crowd was evenly split between female with 51% and under 25 years with 54%. The film closed down its theatrical run on December 18, 2014 and earned a total of $84,273,813 becoming the thirty-fifth highest-grossing movie of 2014 in the US.\n\nThe film was released in Russia on September 26, 2014, a week prior to its wide release and earned $2.1million on its opening weekend, debuting at No. 3 at the Russian box office. Overseas in its opening weekend the film earned $23.6million from nearly 3,300 screen and 39 foreign markets for a first-weekend worldwide total of $60.8million.\n\nHigh openings of \"Annabelle\" internationally were reported in France ($3.4million), Brazil ($3million), the UK ($3.1million), Argentina ($1.2million), Spain ($1.45million) and Germany ($1.14million). In India \"Annabelle\" debuted at #2 behind Bollywood blockbuster \"Bang Bang!\" and collected $1.3million. It set an all-time opening record for a horror film in Peru with $1.34million which is also Warner Bros. second biggest opening weekend of all time there overall. In Mexico, the film earned $10.9million (including previews) on its opening weekend and broke the record for the biggest debut ever for a horror movie and the best 2D opening. Its opening weekend gross is also the third-biggest opening overall of 2014 behind \"Maleficent\" and \"\" there. In total the film took 59% of the total market share.\n\nAs of October 13, 2014, \"Annabelle\" has become the highest-grossing horror film in the Philippines, earning over ₱121.33million. The film surpassed \"\"s record (₱113million), doing so after 12 days of release. The film has also become the highest-grossing horror movie in Lebanon after staying atop the box office for two weekends.\n\n\"Annabelle\" received generally negative reviews from critics, the majority of which felt the film inferior to its predecessor. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 29% based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Annabelle\" borrows unabashedly from better horror films, content to leave viewers with a string of cheap jolts that fail to build on the far more effective \"The Conjuring\".\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nFrank Scheck of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" criticized the film for its cheap production and screenplay, but was positive towards the performances of the cast and saying, \"the film is ultimately so scary and formulaic that you won't forget it.\"\n\nScott Foundas of \"Variety\" gave the film a positive review, calling the film \"inspired\" but periodically cheap. He added \"a cut-rate spinoff from James Wan's superlative haunted-house hit \"The Conjuring\" that (partly) makes up in crude shock effects, but lacks in atmosphere. Designed mainly as a starring vehicle for the eponymous, creepy-as-hell doll (who easily outclasses her human co-stars), this WB/New Line quickie is the thirst of die-hard genre fans and is by the far the best horror movie of the year\".\n\nPete Hammond of \"Deadline\" gave the film a positive review and said that the scary doll show has left him pining for Chucky in \"Child's Play\". He further added, \"\"Annabelle\" may still draw horror fans in this Halloween month, and they will be quaking over the scares in this film.\"\n\nIn October 2014, Fellman told \"The Washington Post\" that the studio was considering a film series based on the film, with a sequel already in the works. In October 2015, it was reported that Gary Dauberman would be returning to write the script. On March 22, 2016, Warner Bros. slated the film for release on May 19, 2017, with \"Lights Out\" director David F. Sandberg directing the film.\n\nIn June 2016, Miranda Otto and Stephanie Sigman were cast to star in the prequel. The story centers on a dollmaker and his wife (Otto) whose daughter tragically dies. Twelve years later they decide to open their home to a nun (Sigman) and several girls from a shuttered orphanage. When the dollmaker’s possessed creation Annabelle sets her sights on the children, it turns their shelter into a storm of horror.\n\nIn April 2018, Warner Bros. announced July 3, 2019, as the release date for an as-yet untitled new film in \"The Conjuring\" franchise. Later that month it was announced that the film will be a third \"Annabelle\" film, with Gary Dauberman signed on to write and direct, in his directorial debut. James Wan and Peter Safran will co-produce the project.\n\n"}
{"id": "19274956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19274956", "title": "Armenian art", "text": "Armenian art\n\nArmenian art is the unique form of art developed over the last five millennia in which the Armenian people lived on the Armenian Highland. Armenian architecture and miniature painting have dominated Armenian art and have shown consistent development over the centuries. Other forms of Armenian art include sculpture, fresco, mosaic, ceramic, metalwork, engraving, and textiles, especially Armenian carpets.\n\nPrehistoric Armenia was home to the Urartu culture in the Iron Age, notable for its early metal sculptures, often of animals. The region was, as later, often contested by the large empires holding the nearby regions of Persia, Mesopotamia and Anatolia, and these all had considerable influence of Armenian art. The Armenians adopted Christianity very early, and developed their own version of Eastern Christian art, with much use of icons, Armenian miniatures in books, and the very original architecture of their churches and monasteries. A distinctive Armenian feature, which may have influenced the Medieval art of Europe, was the popularity from early on of figurative relief carvings on the outside of churches, unknown in Byzantium. \n\nArmenians specialized in arts and crafts such as carpet-weaving.\n\nThe study of Armenian art began in the early 20th century. Notable scholars of Armenian art were Catholicos Garegin Hovsepian and professor Sirarpie Der Nerséssian. More recently, Jean-Michel Thierry and Professor Dickran Kouymjian are prominent scholars of Armenian art.\n\nThe first Armenian churches were built during the lifetime of St. Gregory the Illuminator, were often built on the sites of destroyed pagan temples, and imitated some aspects of Armenian pre-Christian architecture.\n\nClassical and Medieval Armenian architecture is divided into four separate periods.\n\nThe first period, from the 4th to the 7th centuries, began with Armenia's conversion to Christianity, and ended after the Arab invasions of Armenia. The early churches were mostly simple basilicas, some with side apses. By the 5th century the typical cupola cone in the center had become widely used. By the 7th century, centrally-planned churches had been built and the more complicated \"niched buttress\" and radiating \"Hrip'simé\" style had formed. By the time of the Arab invasions, most of what we now know as classical Armenian architecture had formed.\n\nThe second period lasted from the 9th to the 11th centuries. Armenian architecture underwent a revival under the patronage of the Bagratid dynasty with many buildings erected in the regions of Ani and Lake Van: these included both traditional styles and new innovations. Ornately carved Armenian khachkars were developed during this time. Many new cities and churches were built during this time, including a new capital at Lake Van and a Cathedral on Akdamar Island to match. The Cathedral of Ani was also completed during this dynasty. It was during this time that the first major monasteries, such as Haghpat and Haritchavank were founded. This period was ended by the Seljuk invasion.\n\nIlluminated manuscripts were produced in Armenia mainly between the 5th and the 17th centuries. The highest point of this art is associated with the 13th century and the name of Toros Roslin, considered to be the most prominent medieval Armenian manuscript illuminator. The majority of the manuscripts were lost, and scholarly approach to studies of Armenian illuminated manuscripts was only developed in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nEach culture possesses a certain original element which becomes a symbol of the entire national culture. In Armenia such symbol is “\"khachkar\", the so-called cross-stones, the monuments of Armenia which are not found anywhere in the world. The word “khachkar” is formed by two Armenian roots: “khach” (cross) and \"kar\" (stone). Armenia has been called “a country of rocks” and has a rich heritage when it comes to sculptures. Some of the sculptures in the country date way back even before the formation of Armenia as a nation. Such sculptures were created by empires that existed in the region before the modern period. A good example of these is the “Khachkar” which were ancient religious sculptures. Besides these ancient sculptures, Armenia also has plenty of post-war sculptures which show the influence of modern times and also foreign traditions that have been adopted.\n\nCeramics, mosaics, and frescoes constitute a different category of Armenian artwork. The creation of the outlined artifacts dates back to the days of the Urartian Empire that existed long before the establishment of Armenia as a nation. Therefore some of the ancient art is shared among several countries in the region that were part of the Urartian Empire. While the evidence of these forms of art was realized through excavations in the country, their remains have been reconstructed thus providing physical evidence of what they looked like. \n\nArmenia has a history of making engravings and metalwork which are also considered as part of the art. Artifacts in this category can be subdivided into coins, silver and gold, and bronze and tinned copper. The coins refer to the pieces of metals that were designed during the ancient times for trading purposes between Armenia and its neighbors such as Greece. On the other hand, gold and silver were luxury items during ancient Armenia which were fashioned in various ways such as drinking vessels, medallions, and statues just to mention a few. Besides, tinned copper and bronze were also used. Excavations in the country have revealed that these were used to make household items, weapons, and even statues.\n\nTextiles are another part of Armenian art and also a significant part of their economy both in the ancient and present times. One of the most extensive collections of Armenian textiles can be found in the Armenian Museum of America. In the current world, textile products from Armenia are a major trade commodity between Armenia, Europe, and America.\n\nDance and Music are also an essential aspect of the Armenian Heritage. Initially, Armenian music consisted of Armenian Church music and folk songs that were based on an indigenous tonal system (Tetrachords) as opposed to the European tonal system. However, in the present time, other genres of music have influenced Armenian music thus resulting in the production of modern styles in the country such as Hip Hop, Pop, Rock, among many others. Accompanying original Armenian songs was Armenian dance. Native Armenian dance is one of the oldest practices of the inhabitants of the region. Armenian dance is even depicted in some of the ancient paintings on rocks.\n\nIn 2015, Armenia won the Leone d'Oro for Best Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. Besides the above-discussed art categories, Armenia also has well developed contemporary art which is overseen by the Biennale Foundation. The Foundation is responsible for organizing exhibitions in the country which are termed as Art Biennale. The name is used so as to distinguish its exhibitions from other shows conducted by different organizations. The institution has been doing its activities that date back from 1948 to date. \n\n\n\n"}

Part of a larger tradition of similar figures spanning the period from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages, they are human-like in appearance and have been carbon dated to the 2nd or 3rd century BCE; the Schleswig-Holstein state archaeology museum puts them as far back as 400BCE. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain their function and what they may represent, from depictions of deities to ancestor worship.\n\nCarved from carefully selected naturally forked oak branches, the figures are human-like and are (male) and (female) in height. They have sockets for arms (the appendages are missing) and pebbles may have been used for their eyes. The figures exhibit marked sexual dimorphism: in addition to the difference in height, the female has her hair in a topknot and the male has short hair with bangs, and the sexual organs are emphasized. The breasts of the female figure are \"set in separately\" and the male figure's genital had been \"struck off\". The noses are also differentiated, but both have open mouths as if screaming. Fires had repeatedly been built near the site of the find.\n\nThe Braak figures are carbon dated to the 3rd to 2nd century BCE, but have also been dated to the early 4th century BCE. They are among several anthropomorphic wooden figures of varying form unearthed from the Neolithic and into the Middle Ages, in areas of Northern Europe ranging from Schleswig-Holstein in Germany to Norrland in Sweden. The majority of these figures date to the Iron Age and the Roman period. Of these, the Braak Bog Figures are the largest found in Germany, and Malcolm Todd calls them the \"most imposing\".\n\nFokke Sierksma commented in 1960 that as the figures were found together in a peat bog, near a pile of stones containing fragments of pottery and evidence of fire, these find circumstances \"together with the considerable dimension of the figures, and the combination of a male and a female figure, make it virtually certain that they represent deities of Northern Germanic tribes. These located the residence of their gods in peat bogs, and regarded the sacred union of a fertility god and a fertility goddess as prerequisite for the continued propagation of life in all its forms\".\n\nHilda Ellis Davidson (1975) comments that these figures may represent a \"Lord and Lady\" of the Vanir, a group of Norse gods, and that \"another memory of [these wooden figures] may survive in the tradition of the creation of Ask and Embla, the man and woman who founded the human race, created by the gods from trees on the seashore\". It is also possible to regard them as part of ancestor worship.\n\nMalcolm Todd (2009) comments that the Braak Bog Figures and other similar bog figures have a \"significance [that is] difficult to determine but [they] should be related to the supra-mundane and perhaps specifically to the presiding deities of fertility and war\".\n\nThe Braak Bog Figures are in the Schleswig-Holstein state archaeology museum at Gottorf Castle. The post-war conservator there, Karl Schlabow, has been accused of over-restoring archaeological exhibits, including accentuating the sexual characteristics of the Braak figures.\n\n\n"}

It was the first feature film produced by RKO Pictures after a break of many years, though they were only co-distributor with Avco/Embassy Pictures and Hemdale Film Corporation.\n\nRoger Porter (Washington), a black man, is the long-lost son of Walter Whitney (Segal), a white businessman living in the exclusive, predominantly white community of San Marino, California. Walter, who is Jewish, lives a frustrating life in his gated community, sexually and otherwise. One day he finds out about his former girlfriend son's existence. Once Roger turns up at Walter's office, it turns out that he is the result of Walter's relationship with a black woman, who is now dead. For purposes of professional advancement in the business, he left Roger's mother. The only person who knew about Roger's mother was his anti-Semitic father-in-law (Warden) who is also his boss. Walter's father-in-law had warned him that the relationship would be harmful to his career, so Walter under pressure broke it off.\n\nWalter attempts to help Roger by telling his wife Vivian (Saint James) that he wants to adopt him. She accepts, but soon regrets the decision after she finds out about Roger's real relationship with Walter and ends up kicking Walter out.

Costume may refer to the style of dress particular to a nation, a class, or a period. In many cases, it may contribute to the fullness of the artistic, visual world which is unique to a particular theatrical or cinematic production. The most basic designs are produced to denote status, provide protection or modesty, or provide visual interest to a character. Costumes may be for a theater, cinema, or musical performance but may not be limited to such. Costume design should not be confused with costume coordination which merely involves altering existing clothing, although both create stage clothes.\n\nFour types of costumes are used in theatrical design: historical, fantastical, dance, and modern.\n\nVillage festivals and processions in honor of Dionysus (See also: Dionysia) amongst the ancient Greeks, are believed to be the origin of theatre, and therefore theatre costume. The sculpture and vase paintings provide the clearest evidence of this costume. Because of their ritualized style of theatre many masks were used giving each character a specific look and they varied depending if they were used for comedic or dramatic purposes. Some masks were constructed with a cheerful as well as a serious side on the same face in an attempt to indicate a change in emotion without a change of mask. The same is true for the Romans, who continued the mask tradition, which made the doubling of roles easier.\n\nDuring the late Middle Ages in Europe, dramatic enactments of Bible stories were prevalent, therefore actual Christian vestments, stylized from traditional Byzantine court dress, were worn as costumes to keep the performances as realistic as possible. Stereotypical characterization was key when clothing performers for this style of theatre. In most instances actors had to supply their own costumes when playing a character found in daily life.\n\nLater, in Elizabethan performance during the 1500-1600s in England, costume became the most important visual element. Garments were very expensive because only the finest fabrics were used. The majority of characters were clothed in Elizabethan fashion, otherwise the costumes could be divided into five categories; \n\"Ancient\", which was out of style clothing used to represent another period; \"Antique\", older additions to contemporary clothing to distinguish classical characters; Dreamlike, \"fanciful\" garments for supernatural or allegorical characters; \"Traditional\" clothing which represented only a few specific people, such as Robin Hood, or \"National or Racial\" costumes that were intended to set apart a specific group of people but did not tend to be historically accurate.\n\n\"Ordinarily, fashionable garments were used in both comedy and tragedy until 1727, when Adrienne Lecouvreur adopted the much more elaborate and formal court dress for tragedy. Her practice soon became standard for all tragic heroines\" Major actors began to compete with one another as to who would have the most lavish stage dress. This practice continued until around the 1750s when costumes became relevant to the character again. Art began to copy life and realistic characteristics were favored especially during the 19th century. For example, Georg the second, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen took personal interest in the theatre and began managing troupes. He advocated for authenticity and accuracy of the script and time period, therefore he refused to let actors tamper with their own costumes. He also made sure the materials were authentic and specific, using real chain mail, armor, swords, etc. No cheap substitutes would be allowed.\n\nIn August 1823, in an issue of \"The Album\", James Planché published an article saying that more attention should be paid to the time period of Shakespeare's plays, especially when it comes to costumes. In the same year, a casual conversation led to one of Planché's more lasting effects on British theatre. He observed to Charles Kemble, the manager of Covent Garden, that \"while a thousand pounds were frequently lavished upon a Christmas pantomime or an Easter spectacle, the plays of Shakespeare were put upon the stage with makeshift scenery, and, at the best, a new dress or two for the principal characters.\" Kemble \"saw the possible advantage of correct appliances catching the taste of the town\" and agreed to give Planché control of the costuming for the upcoming production of \"King John\", if he would carry out the research, design the costumes and superintend the production. Planché had little experience in this area and sought the help of antiquaries such as Francis Douce and Sir Samuel Meyrick. The research involved sparked Planché's latent antiquarian interests; these came to occupy an increasing amount of his time later in life.\n\nDespite the actors' reservations, \"King John\" was a success and led to a number of similarly-costumed Shakespeare productions by Kemble and Planché (\"Henry IV, Part I\", \"As You Like It\", \"Othello\", \"Cymbeline\", \"Julius Caesar\"). The designs and renderings of \"King John\", \"Henry IV\", \"As You Like It\", \"Othello\", \"Hamlet\" and \"Merchant of Venice\" were published, though there is no evidence that \"Hamlet\" and \"Merchant of Venice\" were ever produced with Planché’s historically accurate costume designs. Planché also wrote a number of plays or adaptations which were staged with historically accurate costumes (\"Cortez\", \"The Woman Never Vext\", \"The Merchant's Wedding\", \"Charles XII\", \"The Partisans\", \"The Brigand Chief\", and \"Hofer\"). After 1830, although he still used period costume, he no longer claimed historical accuracy for his work in plays. His work in \"King John\" had brought about a \"revolution in nineteenth-century stage practice\" which lasted for almost a century.\n\nIn 1923 the first of a series of innovative modern dress productions of Shakespeare plays, \"Cymbeline\", directed by H. K. Ayliff, opened at Barry Jackson's Birmingham Repertory Theatre in England.\n\nCostumes in Chinese theatre are very important, especially in Beijing Opera. They are usually heavily patterned and loud in color. The standard items consist of at least 300 pieces and describe the actors character type, age and social status through ornament, design, color and accessories. \"Color is always used symbolically: red for loyalty and high position, yellow for royalty, and dark crimson for barbarians or military advisors.\" Symbolic significance is also found in the designs used for emblems. For example, the tiger stands for power and masculine strength. A majority of the clothing, regardless of rank, is made out of rich and luxurious materials. Makeup is also used symbolically and very important to the overall look.\n\nIn Japanese Noh drama masks are always used and the prominent aspect of the costume. They are made of wood and usually used for generations. There are five basic types; male, female, aged, deities and monsters, all with many variations. The masks are changed often throughout the play. \nIn Kabuki, another form of Japanese theatre, actors do not wear masks but rely heavily on makeup for the overall look. Features are exaggerated or removed and for some of the athletic roles musculature is outlined in a specific pattern. Traditional costumes are used for each role, based upon historical garments that are altered for dramatic effect. \"Some costumes weigh as much as fifty pounds, and stage attendants assist the actors in keeping them properly arranged while on stage\" \n\nThe costume design process involves many steps and though they differ from genre to genre a basic method is commonly used.\n\n1.) Analysis:\nThe first step is an analysis of the script, musical composition, choreography, etc. Costume Parameters for the show are established and a rough costume plot is created. A costume plot outlines which character is in which scene, when the actors change, and what costumes are mentioned in the script.\n\n2.) Design Collaboration:\nAn important phase in the process where all of the designers meet with the director. There must be a clear understanding of where the show is headed. The designers get on the same page with the director in terms of themes for the show and what message they want the audience to get from the show.\n\n3.) Costume Research:\nOnce the director and designers are on the same page, the next step is for the Costume designer to gather research. Costume designers usually begin with world of the play research where they find research to establish the world where the play takes place. This helps the designers establish the rules of the world and then in turn understand the characters better. The designer will then go into broad research about each character to try to establish their personalities though their costume.\n\n4.) Preliminary Sketching and Color Layout:\nOnce enough information is obtained, Costume designers begin by creating preliminary sketches. beginning with very quick rough sketches the designer can get a basic idea for how the show will look put together and if the rules of the world are being maintained. The Costume designer will then go into more detailed sketches and will figure out the specific costumes and colors for the character. Sketches help see the show as a whole without them having to spend too much time on them.\n\n5.) Final Sketches:\nOnce the Costume Designer and the Director agree on the costumes and the ideas are fully flushed out, the designer will create final sketches. These are called rendering and are usually painted with watercolors or acrylic paints. These final sketches show what the designer wants the character to look like and the colors of the costume.\n\nOnce the show is designed, it is necessary to plan where the items will be sourced. There are four options. Garments can be: \n\nThere are two ways a garment can begin to be constructed; either pattern drafted or draped, and many times both methods will be used together.\nPattern drafting begins by using a set of basic pattern blocks developed from the actor’s measurements. They are drawn out on paper first, then transferred to fabric, and sewn together to test fit.\n\nDraping involves manipulating a piece of fabric on a dress form or mannequin that have measurements closely related to the actors. It is a process that takes a flat piece of cloth and shapes it to conform the fabric to a three-dimensional body by cutting and pinning.\n\nOnce constructed, however, the costume has not finished \"working.\" A most important aspect of costumes is the ways they affect actors' performances and function within their settings. The very best costume designers build their original ideas after assessing the visual and spatial conditions of the costumes.\n\n\n"}

It is popular in parts of the Islamic world amongst traditional Muslims - specifically North Africa, the Levant, Turkey, the Caucasus and the South Asia and is divided into sections for daily recitation.\n\nMoroccan \"hadith\" scholar ‘Abdullah al-Talidi wrote of the \"Dala’il al-Khayrat\": \"Millions of Muslims from East to West tried it and found its good, its blessing, and its benefit for centuries and over generations, and witnessed its unbelievable spiritual blessings and light. Muslims avidly recited it, alone and in groups, in homes and mosques, utterly spending themselves in the Blessings on the Most Beloved and praising him\".\n\nThe \"Dala’il al-Khayrat\" is the first major book in Islamic history which compiled litanies of peace and blessings upon Muhammad. It is also the most popular and most universally acclaimed collection of litanies asking God to bless him. Among some Sunni religious orders, most notably the Shadhili-Jazuli order, its recitation is a daily practice. In others however, its recitation is a purely voluntary daily practice. The work begins with the ninety nine names of God, and then the a collection of over one hundred names of Muhammad.\n\nThe legend behind the origin of the \"Dala’il al-Khayrat\" claims that al-Jazuli once awoke late for his morning prayers and began to look in vain for pure water to perform ritual ablutions. In the midst of his search al-Jazuli encountered a young girl who was aware of al-Jazuli's famed religiosity and was bewildered on why al-Jazuli could not find pure water. The girl then spat into a well which miraculously overflowed with pure sweet water for al-Jazuli to perform ablutions. Consequent to performing prayer, al-Jazuli inquired to the means by which the girl achieved such a high spiritual station. The girl replied it was simply by \"Making constant prayer for God to bless the best of creation by the number of breaths and heartbeats.\" Al-Jazuli then resolved to write a work collecting litanies of prayers asking God to bless and show mercy and kindness to Muhammad.\n\nAl-Jazuli then moved east to Medina where he would recite the whole of the \"Dala’il al-Khayrat\" twice daily at Muhammad's grave in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi. The \"Dala'il Khayrat\" has since been seen as a testament of love and passionate longing for Muhammad.\n\nMany of exegesis were written on the \"Dala'il Khayrat\" - most notably by the scholar Yusuf an-Nabhani in his work \"Afdal al-Salawat\", and 'Abd al-Majid al-Sharnubi al-Azhari's \"Sharh Dala'il Khayrat\". A classic Ottoman era work by Kara Davud is popular in Turkish, titled \"Muwafik-ul Khayrat Linayl-el Barakat Fi Khidmat-as Saadat\", in short known as \"Kara Davud\".\n\n"}
{"id": "205534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205534", "title": "Editorial cartoon", "text": "Editorial cartoon\n\nAn editorial cartoon, also known as a political cartoon, is a drawing containing a commentary expressing the artist's opinion. An artist who writes and draws such images is known as an editorial cartoonist. They typically combine artistic skill, hyperbole and satire in order to question authority and draw attention to corruption, political violence and other social ills.\n\nDeveloped in England in the latter part of the 18th century, James Gillray was a pioneer of the political cartoon. Founded in 1841, the British periodical \"Punch\" appropriated the term cartoon to refer to its political cartoons, which led to the term's widespread use.\n\nThe pictorial satire has been credited as the precursor to the political cartoons in England: John J. Richetti, in \"The Cambridge history of English literature, 1660–1780\", states that \"English graphic satire really begins with Hogarth's \"Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme\"\". William Hogarth’s pictures combined social criticism with sequential artistic scenes. A frequent target of his satire was the corruption of early 18thcentury British politics. An early satirical work was an \"Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme\" (c.1721), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 known as the South Sea Bubble, in which many English people lost a great deal of money.\n\nHis art often had a strong moralizing element to it, such as in his masterpiece of 1732–33, \"A Rake's Progress\", engraved in 1734. It consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from sex workers, and gambling—the character's life ultimately ends in Bethlem Royal Hospital.\n\nHowever, his work was only tangentially politicized and was primarily regarded on its artistic merits. George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.\n\nThe medium began to develop in England in the latter part of the 18th century—especially around the time of the French Revolution—under the direction of its great exponents, James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and caricature, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon. Calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account, many of Gillray's satires were directed against George III, depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of Revolutionary France and Napoleon. The times in which Gillray lived were peculiarly favourable to the growth of a great school of caricature. Party warfare was carried on with great vigour and not a little bitterness; and personalities were freely indulged in on both sides. Gillray's incomparable wit and humour, knowledge of life, fertility of resource, keen sense of the ludicrous, and beauty of execution, at once gave him the first place among caricaturists.\n\nGeorge Cruikshank became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray (1820s–40s). His early career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications. He gained notoriety with his political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians and was bribed in 1820 \"not to caricature His Majesty\" (George IV) \"in any immoral situation\". His work included a personification of England named John Bull who was developed from about 1790 in conjunction with other British satirical artists such as Gillray and Rowlandson.\n\nThe art of the editorial cartoon was further developed with the publication of the British periodical \"Punch\" in 1841, founded by Henry Mayhew and engraver Ebenezer Landells (an earlier magazine that published cartoons was \"Monthly Sheet of Caricatures\", printed from 1830 and an important influence on \"Punch\"). It was bought by Bradbury and Evans in 1842, who capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies to turn the magazine into a preeminent national institution. The term \"cartoon\" to refer to comic drawings was coined by the magazine in 1843; the Houses of Parliament were to be decorated with murals, and \"carttons\" for the mural were displayed for the public; the term \"cartoon\" then meant a finished preliminary sketch on a large piece of cardboard, or in Italian. \"Punch\" humorously appropriated the term to refer to its political cartoons, and the popularity of the \"Punch\" cartoons led to the term's widespread use.\n\nArtists who published in \"Punch\" during the 1840s and 50s included John Leech, Richard Doyle, John Tenniel and Charles Keene. This group became known as \"The \"Punch\" Brotherhood\", which also included Charles Dickens who joined Bradbury and Evans after leaving Chapman and Hall in 1843. \"Punch\" authors and artists also contributed to another Bradbury and Evans literary magazine called \"Once A Week\" (est.1859), created in response to Dickens' departure from \"Household Words\".\n\nThe most prolific and influential cartoonist of the 1850s and 60s was John Tenniel, chief cartoon artist for \"Punch\", who perfected the art of physical caricature and representation to a point that has changed little up to the present day. For over five decades he was a steadfast social witness to the sweeping national changes that occurred during this period alongside his fellow cartoonist John Leech. The magazine loyally captured the general public mood; in 1857, following the Indian Rebellion and the public outrage that followed, \"Punch\" published vengeful illustrations such as Tenniel's \"Justice\" and \"The British Lion's Vengeance on the Bengal Tiger\".\n\nBy the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many countries featured cartoons designed to express the publisher's opinion on the politics of the day. One of the most successful was Thomas Nast in New York City, who imported realistic German drawing techniques to major political issues in the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Nast was most famous for his 160 editorial cartoons attacking the criminal characteristics of Boss Tweed's political machine in New York City. Albert Boime argues that:\n\nAs a political cartoonist, Thomas Nast wielded more influence than any other artist of the 19th century. He not only enthralled a vast audience with boldness and wit, but swayed it time and again to his personal position on the strength of his visual imagination. Both Lincoln and Grant acknowledged his effectiveness in their behalf, and as a crusading civil reformer he helped destroy the corrupt Tweed Ring that swindled New York City of millions of dollars. Indeed, his impact on American public life was formidable enough to profoundly affect the outcome of every presidential election during the period 1864 to 1884.\n\nNotable editorial cartoons include Benjamin Franklin's \"Join, or Die\" (1754), on the need for unity in the American colonies; \"The Thinkers Club\" (1819), a response to the surveillance and censorship of universities in Germany under the Carlsbad Decrees; and E. H. Shepard's \"The Goose-Step\" (1936), on the rearmament of Germany under Hitler. \"The Goose-Step\" is one of a number of notable cartoons first published in the British \"Punch\" magazine.\n\nInstitutions which archive and document editorial cartoons include the Center for the Study of Political Graphics in the United States, and the British Cartoon Archive in the United Kingdom.\n\nEditorial cartoons and editorial cartoonists are recognised by a number of awards, for example the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning (for US cartoonists, since 1922) and the British Press Awards' \"Cartoonist of the Year\".\n\nPolitical cartoons can usually be found on the editorial page of many newspapers, although a few (such as Garry Trudeau's \"Doonesbury\") are sometimes placed on the regular comic strip page. Most cartoonists use visual metaphors and caricatures to address complicated political situations, and thus sum up a current event with a humorous or emotional picture.\n\nYaakov Kirschen, creator of the Israeli comic strip \"Dry Bones\", says his cartoons are designed to make people laugh, which makes them drop their guard and see things the way he does. In an interview, he defined his objective as a cartoonist as an attempt to \"seduce rather than to offend.\" \n\nModern political cartooning can be built around traditional visual metaphors and symbols such as Uncle Sam, the Democratic donkey and the Republican elephant. One alternative approach is to emphasize the text or the story line, as seen in \"Doonesbury\" which tells a linear story in comic strip format. \n\nCartoons have a great potential to political communication capable of enhancing political comprehension and reconceptualization of events, through speciﬁc frames of understanding (Mateus, 2016). Mateus' analysis \"seems to indicate that the double standard thesis can be actually applied to trans-national contexts. This means that the framing of politics and business may not be limited to one country but may reﬂect a political world-view occurring in contemporary societies. From the double standard standpoint, there are no fundamental differences in the way Canadian political cartoonists and Portuguese political cartoons assess politics and business life\" (Mateus, 2016:216). The paper does not tell that all political cartoons are based on this kind of double standard, but suggests that the double standard thesis in Political Cartoons may be a frequent frame among possible others.\n\nA political cartoon commonly draws on two unrelated events and brings them together incongruously for humorous effect. The humour can reduce people's political anger and so serves a useful purpose. Such a cartoon also reflects real life and politics, where a deal is often done on unrelated proposals beyond public scrutiny.\n\nA pocket cartoon is a form of cartoon which generally consists of a topical political gag/joke and appears as a single-panel single-column drawing. It was introduced by Osbert Lancaster in 1939 at the \"Daily Express\". A 2005 obituary by \"The Guardian\" of its pocket cartoonist David Austin said \"Newspaper readers instinctively look to the pocket cartoon to reassure them that the disasters and afflictions besetting them each morning are not final. By taking a sideways look at the news and bringing out the absurd in it, the pocket cartoonist provides, if not exactly a silver lining, then at least a ray of hope.\"\n\nEditorial cartoons sometimes cause controversies. Examples include the \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy (stemming from the publication of cartoons of Muhammad) and the 2007 Bangladesh cartoon controversy.\n\nLibel lawsuits have been rare. In Britain, the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century came in 1921 when J.H. Thomas, the leader of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the British Communist Party. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of \"Black Friday\"—when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out Miners' Federation. Thomas won his lawsuit, and restored his reputation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1765351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1765351", "title": "Edward Askew Sothern", "text": "Edward Askew Sothern\n\nEdward Askew Sothern (1 April 1826 – 20 January 1881) was an English actor known for his comic roles in Britain and America, particularly Lord Dundreary in \"Our American Cousin\".\n\nSothern was born in Liverpool, the son of a merchant. He began studying medicine, and his parents hoped that he would become a minister, but he decided against pursuing those professions. He worked as a clerk in the late 1840s and married Frances Emily \"Fannie\" Stewart (d. 1882). He began acting as an amateur in 1848 under the stage name of Douglas Stewart. In 1849 he appeared in his first professional engagement at Saint Helier in Jersey, as Claude Melnotte in Bulwer Lytton's \"The Lady of Lyons\". In the early 1850s, he played in various English companies without particular success in Portsmouth, Wolverhampton and Birmingham.\n\nSothern travelled to America in 1852, first playing Dr. Pangloss in \"The Heir at Law\" in Boston, Massachusetts, with John Lacy's company at the National Theatre. He then played at the Howard Athenaeum in Boston and at Barnum's American Museum in New York. In 1854, he joined the company at Wallack's Theatre. In the early part of his career, Sothern's wife often performed with him. By 1856, he had begun using his own name, Sothern, on stage. He had become associated with Laura Keene's company in New York by 1856. He finally gained attention at Wallack's Theatre in New York starring as Armand in \"Camille\". The critic Clement Scott noted that while Sothern was \"as handsome a man as ever stood on the stage\", he was not naturally suited to romantic roles.\n\nAs a result of his success in \"Camille\", Sothern was given a part in Tom Taylor's \"Our American Cousin\" at Laura Keene's Theatre. This piece would later become famous as the play that Abraham Lincoln was watching when he was assassinated. Sothern's role was Lord Dundreary, a caricature of a brainless English nobleman. At first, he was reluctant to accept the role; it was so small and unimportant that he felt it beneath him and feared it might damage his reputation. He mentioned his qualms to his friend, Joseph Jefferson, who had been cast in the leading role of Asa Trenchard in the play. Jefferson supposedly responded with the famous line: \"There are no small parts, only small actors.\"\n\nOn 15 October 1858, \"Our American Cousin\" premiered in New York. After a couple of unhappy weeks in the small role, Sothern began portraying the role as a lisping, skipping, eccentric, weak-minded fop prone to nonsensical references to sayings of his \"bwother\" Sam. His ad-libs were a sensation, earning good notices for his physical comedy and spawning much imitation and merry mockery on both sides of the Atlantic. His exaggerated, droopy side-whiskers became known as \"Dundrearys\". Sothern gradually expanded the role, adding gags and business until it became the central figure of the play. The most famous scene involved Dundreary reading a letter from his even sillier brother. The play ran for 150 nights, which was very successful for a New York run at the time. Sothern made his London debut in the role when the play ran for 496 performances at the Haymarket Theatre in 1861, earning rave reviews. \"The Athenaeum\" wrote, \"it is certainly the funniest thing in the world... a vile caricature of a vain nobleman, intensely ignorant, and extremely indolent\".\n\nDundreary became a popular recurring character, and Sothern successfully revived the play many times, making Dundreary by far his most famous role. A number of spin-off works were also created, including Charles Gayler's sequel, \"Our American Cousin at Home, or, Lord Dundreary Abroad\" (Buffalo, New York, 1860, and then New York City, 1861) and H. J. Byron's \"Dundreary Married and Done For\". Sothern wrote his own play, \"Suspense\", produced for Keene's 1860-61 season. He won wide popularity from his interpretation of Sam Slingsby in John Oxenford's \"Brother Sam\" (1862; revived in 1865), a play about Dundreary's brother.\n\nIn 1864, Sothern created the title role in Tom Robertson's \"David Garrick\" at the Haymarket Theatre. The play was a great success. \"The Times\" praised Sothern's acting in the Act II scene where Sothern depicted \"the most extravagant form of drunkenness... perpetually brought into contact with the real agony of mind which is now on the point of casting aside the mask of debauchery\". He also appeared in Robertson's \"Home\" and later claimed to have written some of the best scenes in each work (a claim that was disputed by Robertson). Other plays written for the now-famous Sothern were \"The Woman in Mauve\", by Watts Phillips; \"The Favourite of Fortune\" and \"A Hero of Romance\" by Westland Marston; \"A Lesson for Life\" by Tom Taylor; and \"An English Gentleman\" by H. J. Byron (1871) at the Haymarket. Sothern continued to act mostly in London until 1876, but also toured extensively in the British provinces, North America and Europe.\n\nSothern became popular with Robertson's crowd, including with the Haymarket's manager, John Baldwin Buckstone, actor J. L. Toole, and dramatists Byron and W. S. Gilbert, who later wrote three plays for him, \"Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith\" (1876), \"The Ne'er-do-Weel\" (1878), and \"Foggerty's Fairy\" (1881). He was known as a sportsman and bon vivant and became famous for his magic tricks, conversation and, especially, his practical jokes (he was born on April fool's day). Sothern and his friends demanded that clerks sell them goods not carried by the store in question, staged mock arguments on public omnibuses, ran fake advertisements in newspapers, paid street urchins to annoy passers-by and so forth. At one restaurant, Toole and Sothern removed the silver and hid under the table. When the unfortunate waiter found the dining room empty and the silver gone, he ran to report the theft. By the time he returned, Toole and Sothern had re-set the table as if nothing had happened.\n\nSothern left England to tour in America in early 1876 and wrote to Gilbert to be ready with a play by October that would feature him in a serious role. This play eventually became \"Dan'l Druce\". However, Sothern produced but did not star in the play. Gilbert soon wrote another play for Sothern, this time a comedy, \"The Ne'er-do-Weel\". Sothern was not pleased with the work, and Gilbert offered to take it back. Although it was eventually produced, Sothern did not appear in it. Sothern had already paid Gilbert for the play, and Gilbert was unable immediately to pay him back. After various arrangements between Gilbert and Sothern involving American productions of another Gilbert play, \"Engaged\" (1877), Gilbert finally promised, in 1878, to write a new play for Sothern. This was to be \"Foggerty's Fairy\".\n\nSothern's biographer T. Edgar Pemberton noted that one role he regretted not playing was Cheviot in \"Engaged\". Sothern continued to tour and perform Dundreary and other works. In October 1877 at the Academy of Music in New York, he played the title role in \"Othello\".\n\nSothern's next great role was the title role, Fitzaltamont, in a hit revival of Byron's \"The Crushed Tragedian\" (1878, originally named \"The Prompter's Box\") at the Haymarket. \"The Era\" admired \"the sepulchral tones, the glaring eyeballs, the long hair, the wonderful 'stage walk', the melodramatic attitudes\" of his portrayal. He next appeared in \"The Hornet's Nest\" by Byron at the Haymarket. \"The Crushed Tragedian\" was not a great success in London, but it became a hit in New York. \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" raved, \"With what elaboration of detail does the actor embody his conception! There is not a gesture, not an intonation, not a movement, but seems to illustrate the character portrayed. He strides across the stage and it is as though he were wading through a sea of gore; he mutters to himself ‘Ha! ha!’ and you know that he is cursing fate with a bitterness loud and deep. always and in all things poor Altamont is exquisitely, indescribably ludicrous.\" In April 1879, he was still at the Haymarket, appearing in Lord Lytton's play \"Money\" as Sir Frederick Blount.\n\nIn the autumn of 1879, after a long summer fishing trip, Sothern was on another American tour. \"The Era\" wrote in October 1879 that \"It is proposed, during Mr Sothern's [American] engagement, to bring out revivals of \"The Crushed Tragedian\", \"Dundreary\", and \"David Garrick\", the new comedy by Mr Gilbert being reserved for the spring engagement.\" On 29 February 1880 \"The Era\" reported: \"Mr Sothern says that, although his new comedy, by Mr Gilbert, has cost him 3,000 guineas, he would not take 6,000 guineas for it now. It is a piece of the wildest absurdity ever perpetrated, and all the parts are immense.\" The same issue of \"The Era\" states that definite plans had been made for Sothern to appear at the Gaiety Theatre, London in \"Foggerty's Fairy\", as the new play was now called, in October 1880, after the end of his American tour. Sothern had been ill for much of the time since the fall, although he fulfilled his performing commitments. Sothern returned to England for a six-week holiday in June 1880, still planning to produce \"Fogerty's Fairy\" in New York. After one illness and a short European tour, Sothern fell seriously ill in the fall, and his health declined until he died in January 1881, never having performed Gilbert's play.\nSothern died at his home in Cavendish Square, London, at the age of 54 and is buried in Southampton Old Cemetery, Southampton. Sothern was such a notorious practical joker that many of his friends missed his funeral, thinking it was a joke. His sister, Mary Cowan, was the principal beneficiary of his last will, signed shortly before his death. A previous will had given most of the estate to his widow and children. Sothern's widow contested the will but lost, and it took Cowan until 31 May 1881 to obtain probate. Gilbert suggested that she \"underlet\" \"Foggerty's Fairy\" to him, and he eventually had it produced. Later, she wrote to him: \"Allow me to say that of all the people with whom I have had any dealings in reference to money since my Brother's death, you have treated me with the greatest kindness & fairness & I feel grateful to you for sparing me any trouble or anxiety.\"\n\nSothern and his wife had four children, all of whom became actors: Lytton Edward (1851–1887), Edward Hugh (E. H.), George Evelyn Augustus T. (b. 1870; who used the stage name Sam Sothern) and Eva Mary. E. H. Sothern became prominent on the American stage. Sothern's house in Kensington, London was a resort for people of fashion, and he was as much a favourite in America as in the United Kingdom.\n\nSothern's passion for practical joking amounted almost to a mania. He would often falsely announce the death of a friend or send people on fool's errands. Among his most elaborate practical jokes was the following. When the husband of actress Adelaide Neilson, Philip Henry Lee, visited New York in the mid-19th century, he had been warned about the wild, bohemian behaviour of American authors, but expressed his doubt as to the veracity of the stories. Sothern assured him it was true and arranged a private dinner for Lee with twelve \"writers and critics\", who were really actors. During the dinner, a quarrel arose over literary matters, culminating in a fight breaking out. The men, apparently drunk, brandished an axe, knives and revolvers. The room was filled with shouts, shots and struggle. Someone thrust a knife into Lee's hand, saying, \"Defend yourself! This is butchery, sheer butchery!\" Sothern advised him to \"Keep cool, and don't get shot\", before the joke was exposed.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34903083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34903083", "title": "Gender representation in video games", "text": "Gender representation in video games\n\nThe portrayal of men and women in video games, as in other media, is a subject of research in gender studies and is discussed in the context of sexism in video gaming.\n\nAlthough women make up about half of video game players, they are significantly underrepresented as characters in mainstream games, despite the prominence of iconic heroines such as Samus Aran or Lara Croft. The portrayal of women in games often reflects traditional gender roles, sexual objectification or negative stereotypes, such as that of the \"damsel in distress\". Male characters are often stereotypically depicted as big and muscular, and LGBT characters have been slow to appear in video games as a result of the heteronormativity of the medium.\n\nResearch indicates that how genders are portrayed in games can influence players' perception of gender roles, and that young girls prefer to play a character of their own gender much more than boys do. On average, female-led games sell fewer copies than male-led ones, but also have lower marketing budgets.\n\nA 2008 Gallup poll indicated that half of all American video game players were women. In 2014 in the UK and in Spain, women comprised 52% and 48% of video game players respectively. According to a 2008 study by Pew Research Center, \"Fully 99% of boys and 94% of girls play videogames.\"\n\nBoth men and women play video games, but studies suggest differences in platform and game genre preference. The Entertainment Software Rating Board reports that in 2010, 80% of female console gamers played on Wii, 11% on Xbox360 and 9% on PS3. By comparison, 38% of male console gamers in the year 2014 played Xbox 360, 41% played Wii and 21% played PS3.\n\nA 2013 study by Flurry looked at the different mobile gaming preferences between men and women. Women made up 60–80% of the solitaire, slots, social turn-based, match-three / bubble-shooter, management / simulation and quiz game markets. Men on the other hand, made up between 60–80% of the strategy, shooter, card battle, racing and action RPG markets.\n\nA 2014 SuperData Research study found that men and women enjoy video games, but some genres are attracting one gender more than the other: Women compose 57.8 percent of the mobile market, 53.6 percent of the RPG market and 50.2 percent of the PC market (including social games). The study found that men make up 66 percent of MMO players, 66 percent of FPS players and 63 percent of digital console players. \n\nPlayable female characters were found to appear less frequently than male characters in reviews for popular games in a 2006 study from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. A 2007 study by Melinda C. R. Burgess et al. found that men are featured much more often than women on the covers of console video games.\n\nIn a sample of 669 action, shooter, and role-playing games selected by EEDAR in 2012, 300 (45%) provided the option of playing as a female, but only 24 (4%) had an exclusively female protagonist. EEDAR found in 2010 that 10% of games had a protagonist with an indiscernible gender.\n\nAccording to Madeline Messer writing in the \"Washington Post\" in 2015, among the top 50 endless running games for mobile devices, 98% of those with gender-identifiable characters featured male protagonists, of which 90% were free to play. Only 46% of these games offered female characters, and only 15% offered them for free. Playing as a girl required, on average, an additional purchase of $7.53, much more than the games themselves cost.\n\nSamus Aran, the heroine of \"Metroid\" (1986) and its successors, is often cited as \"the first playable human female character in a mainstream video game\". However, other earlier games featured female player characters, such as Toby Masuyo (\"Kissy\") from \"Baraduke\" (1985) or Kurumi-Hime from \"Sega Ninja\" (1985). \n\nStudies of the prevalence of female characters in video games began to be conducted in sociological, educational, and cultural journals as early as the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1979, researchers publishing in \"Psychological Record\" (Vol.29, No.1. Pp. 43–48) concluded from the results of a 201-person survey that 90% of male subjects and 85% of female subjects perceived the computer as masculine (in gameplay versus the computer). In 1983, professor Sara Kiesler et al. published a study in \"Psychology Today\" (Vol.17, No.3. Pp. 40–48.) finding that female characters appeared in video games at a frequency of 1 game in 7. Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz suggested that the reduced presence of female characters implies a secondary status for women in video games. When playable female characters do appear in video games, they are more often scantily dressed and oversexualized than men.\n\nLara Croft, the protagonist of \"Tomb Raider\" (1996), is among the best-known strong, fictional women in a variety of media. Since her introduction in 1996, the character of Croft has been criticized for her \"unrealistic\" breast size; Lara was claimed to personify \"an ongoing culture clash over gender, sexuality, empowerment, and objectification.\" In a 2008 Tomb Raider title, Croft was depicted in \"hot pants\" and \"middriffs\" and was said to look like she \"was dressed by a male\". However, the game's creators maintain that she was not designed with marketing in mind, and have claimed to be rather surprised at her pinup-style adoration. In \"\", Lara underwent a radical redesign, ostensibly to make her less sexualized.\n\nApril Ryan from \"The Longest Journey\" (1999) has been compared to Lara Croft, as she shows less prominent physical feminine attributes than Lara but more feminine psychological traits, as contrasted with Lara's masculine connotations like aggressiveness and force. Contrarily, Jade, the protagonist of \"Beyond Good & Evil\" (2003), was widely recognized as a strong and confident female character lacking any overt sexualisation.\n\nThe year 2013 featured women in leading roles in a number of award-winning games such as \"The Last of Us\" (2013), \"Bioshock Infinite\" (2013), the rebooted \"Tomb Raider\" (2013), and \"\" (2013). A study of these games found that although the leading female characters in these games were able to subvert predominant gender stereotypes, women were still limited by men in the narratives, in particular through benevolent sexism.\n\nIn 2014 the developers' choice to omit playable women in the latest iterations of the top-tier gaming franchises \"Assassin's Creed\" and \"Far Cry\" became a focus of discussions in gaming media. This indicated, according to game industry professionals cited by \"Polygon\", a shift in the industry's attention towards issues of diversity in gaming, in conjunction with video games as a whole growing beyond their former core audience of younger men.\n\nWomen of color or people of color as a whole are less likely to be represented by the popular games and more likely to be represented as a stereotype. There is also a higher chance of people of color, especially women, to be portrayed as villains.\n\nFemale characters are often cast in the role of the damsel in distress, with their rescue being the objective of the game. Princess Zelda in the early \"The Legend of Zelda\" series, the Sultan's daughter in \"Prince of Persia\", and Princess Peach through much of the \"Mario\" series are paradigmatic examples. According to Salzburge Academy on Media and Global Change, in 1981 Nintendo offered game designer Shigeru Miyamoto to create a new video game for the American market. In the game the hero was Mario, and the objective of the game was to rescue a young princess named Peach. Peach was depicted as having a pink dress and blonde hair. The princess was kidnapped and trapped in a castle by the evil villain character Bowser, who is depicted as a turtle. Princess Peach appears in 15 of the main Super Mario games and is kidnapped in 13 of them. The only main games that Peach was not kidnapped in were in the North America release of \"Super Mario 2\" and \"Super Mario 3D World\", but she was a character that can be played. Zelda became playable in some later games of the \"Legend of Zelda\" series or had the pattern altered.\"In video games, the major stereotyped myths of women are typically the damsel in distress, hyper-sexualized villain (Sylvia Christel from \"No More Heroes\") and the sexy/strong best friend (Tifa from \"Final Fantasy VII\"). ... In all of these instances, the female character is, more likely than not, in love with the male protagonist or trying desperately to bang him.\"\n\nA number of games feature a female character as an ally or sidekick to the male hero. Some of them, like Ada Wong of \"Resident Evil\" and Mona Sax of \"Max Payne\", were turned into player characters in later instances of their series. Alyx Vance, a supporting protagonist of \"Half-Life 2\", was praised for her \"stinging personality\" and intelligence, developing a close bond with the player without simply being \"eye candy\".\n\nOne of the first major female villains in video games was the Dark Queen in \"Battletoads\" (1991) and its sequels. SHODAN, an artificial intelligence with a female voice and a female face, was the main villain of the game \"System Shock\" (1994), praised as one of the most recognizable female characters in gaming. Another prominent female villain is Ultimecia, the main antagonist in \"Final Fantasy VIII\" (1999). At PAX Prime 2013, she was voted among the best female antagonists in video gaming history. Similarly, GLaDOS from \"Portal\" (2007), an insane computer with a female voice, was praised by critics as one of the best new characters of the 2000s.\n\nThe portrayal of women in video games has been the subject of academic study and controversy since the early 1980s. Recurring themes in articles and discussions on the topic include the sexual objectification and sexualization of female characters, done to appeal to a presumed male audience, as well as the degree to which female characters are independent from their male counterparts within the same game. Research on exposure to sexualized media representations of women in television and magazines has asked whether it reduces male compassion toward women, and reduces women's perceptions of their desire and suitability for various vocations.\n\nIn their 2005 study, Dill and Thill distinguish three major stereotypical depictions of women in gaming: (1) sexualized, (2) scantily clad, and (3) a vision of beauty. The study revealed that over 80% of women in video games represented one of these depictions. More than one quarter of female characters embodied all of the three stereotypical categories at once. Dill and Thill also note that another prevalent theme with which women were depicted was a combination of aggression and sex, referred to as \"eroticized aggression\". According to sociology professor and researcher Tracy Dietz, women are often depicted in stereotypical roles that typically pertain to sexuality in which the woman focuses upon beauty/physical attractiveness. According to an analysis conducted by Downs and Smith, playable and plot relevant characters in the 60 best selling video games of 2003 were predominantly male. Females who were depicted were frequently sexualized. The female characters analyzed were depicted partially naked or with unrealistic proportions more often than the male characters were. A study of 225 video game covers found that both male and female character's physiques were over-exaggerated, but women were more \"physically altered\" (especially in the bust) than their male counterparts, and even more so if the female was the main character of the game.\n\nA 2016 study of 571 games released between 1984 and 2014 found that the sexualization of female characters was at its height between 1990 and 2005, and then began to significantly decline. It also determined that there was no significant difference in sexualization between games rated as \"Teen\" (for ages 13 and up) and \"Mature\" (17 and up) by the ESRB, indicating that sexualized women in games are so prevalent that they are not thought of as objectionable to children. Less sexualization was found in RPGs, which are played more often by women, than in action and fighting games.\n\nMany early female video game characters (such as Ms. Pac-Man) are identical to an existing male character, except for a visual marker of their femininity, such as pink bows, lipstick and long eyelashes.\n\nFemale video game characters have been criticized as having a tendency to be subjects of the \"male gaze\". A print ad for the fighting game \"Soulcalibur V\" received some controversy for simply being a close up of female character Ivy Valentine's breasts with a tagline. In two sequels of fighting games \"Soulcalibur\" and \"Tekken\" that take place several years after the original issue, recurring male characters were all aged but all female characters were kept the same age or were replaced by their daughters. Many games, particularly fighting games, also feature pronounced \"breast physics\", which make the breasts of female characters bounce or jiggle in an exaggerated manner.\n\nA recurrent representation of women in fantasy settings, originating in the 1960s, is the female warrior dressed in scanty armor. They feature armor designs which have been described by such terms as \"chainmail bikinis\", largely consisting of small decorative plaques that reveal large portions of the body to the weather and expose vital organs, making them ineffective as protection. The prevalence of this portrayal is presented as an instance of the common sexualization of women in the geek culture including video games, comic and movies. In reaction to this, the art blog \"Women Fighters in Reasonable Armor\" compiles depictions of women fighters wearing \"realistic\" armor.\n\nVideo games have been criticized for depicting violence against women. For example, the 2013 game \"\" generated controversy when the special \"zombie bait\" edition of the game included a statue of a torso of a busty, dismembered woman in a skimpy bikini. While much of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" franchise has had issues with claims of violence against women, Rockstar North's \"Grand Theft Auto V\" was also surrounded in much criticism; so much so that the sale of it was banned by certain retailers in Australia.\n\nThe 1982 game \"Custer's Revenge\" was first noted for containing elements of rape and some Native American groups and the National Organization for Women have criticised this as well as alleged racism.\n\nThe 2013 reboot of \"Tomb Raider\" drew controversy when \"Kotaku\" described it as using rape for Lara Croft's character development. The developers denied that the scene depicted an attempted rape.\n\nMen are also often portrayed stereotypically in games. A recurring depiction of male sexuality is the \"power fantasy,\" where an apparent sexualization as an object of desire and hypermasculinity are overruled by the character's agency as the protagonist and avatar for the player’s power within the game world.\n\nMen in games tend to be shown as muscular and big. For instance, men in video games have chests that are about 2 inches (6%) larger, heads that are about 13 inches bigger, waists that are 5 inches wider, and hips that are 7 inches wider, than in reality. They are often characterized as overtly aggressive and violent. Following the releases of \"Grand Theft Auto V\", the developers were met with criticism regarding both the portrayal of women and torture, but also that of men. Two of the main characters, Trevor Philips and Michael De Santa, have since been interpreted by some as portraying men as \"liars, cheats, bad husbands and fathers, and psychopaths\".\n\nGamesRadar writer David Houghton, writing in an article on sexism in video games, was highly critical of many stereotypes that came with male protagonists, outlining them as \"the primeval hunter/gatherer type [with] arm-cripplingly ripped biceps, necks too muscley to turn, emotion dials stuck on 'aggressive grimace' and a 50% lack of chest coverings\".\n\nJamin Warren on PBS Game/Show highlighted that video games could promote \"unreasonable body expectations, or an inability to express emotion, or the pressure to 'man up' and be a leader\". He also highlighted that the vast majority of characters who perform and experience violence in video games are men, while women and children are generally to be protected.\n\nThe \"male protagonist bingo\", a 2014 thought experiment by game designer Anna Kreider, is intended to show that many prominent male game protagonists match the same sort of stereotypes because it is possible to fill out a bingo card for them that contains the following attributes:\n\nMultiple critics point out the \"male gaze\" as the reason why male characters are not overtly sexualized in the same way as female characters are, mentioning the assumption in the video game industry that a majority of gamers are heterosexual men, to whom companies cater.\n\nDante Douglas of \"Paste\" magazine identifies the \"power fantasy\" alongside two other stereotypes, men as \"gender performance\" and as \"fan interpretation\":\n\nLGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender) characters have been included in video games as early as the 1980s and 1990s. While there has been a trend towards greater representation of LGBT people in video games, they are frequently identified as LGBT in secondary material, such as comics, rather than in the games themselves.\n\nIn the history of video games, LGBT content has been subject to changing rules and regulations, which are generally examples of heterosexism, in that heterosexuality is normalized, while homosexuality is subject to additional censorship or ridicule. Companies Nintendo, Sega and Maxis policed the content of games with content codes in which LGBT themes were toned down or erased. Some games, for instance, originally included trans characters, such as Birdo from Super Mario Bros, Poison from the Final Fight series, and Flea from Chrono Trigger. Due to adherence to Nintendo's quality standards and translations based on preserving gameplay rather than literal meaning, these characters' identities were altered or erased in translation.\n\nThe video game industry is regarded as having heteronormative bias by numerous analysts. According to industry professionals interviewed by Shaw, reasons for this heteronormativity include the demographic of those who play games, the views of those who create games, the risk of backlash in the industry, and the storytelling limitations of the medium.\n\nChoice based LGBT content, such as optional same sex romance in Bioware games, is a low- risk form of representation that occurs only in video games. When representation is included, it is often through these in-game choices, which place the responsibility for representation on players instead of developers. Because they afford the most opportunity for player choice and in game romance, genres such as RPGs and MMOs are the most LGBT representative. Another low risk method of LGBT representation is \"Gay window gaming,\" which is LGBT representation that is either subtle or avoidable in games that serves to appeal to LGBT players without alienating straight or homophobic players. This can occur in sandbox games such as The Sims.\n\nIn games with LGBT characters or the option of an LGBT avatar, some aspects of marginalization that occur in contemporary culture are depicted despite the game's overall adherence to reality. These real social constraints are imposed on a virtual world due to the way games are constructed and the community that inhabits them. Games are made on contemporary culture's heteronormative basis, and this shapes narrative and characters. In the popular MMO \"World of Warcraft\", for example, this has \"created an oppressive atmosphere for individuals who do not adhere to a heteronormative lifestyle\", according to a 2013 assessment of the game's community.\n\nBoth members of the industry and LGBT players prefer LGBT representation to be normalized in game narratives rather than made to seem abnormal or special. There are no games produced specifically to appeal to an LGBT audience. LGBT players prefer this so they can avoid marginalization in the gaming community.\n\nLGBT gamers use queer readings of media to compensate for their lack of representation in it. As concluded in a study by Moravec, this \"imaginative play\" is the most common method LGBT gamers use to relate to in game avatars that are typically created for a presumed straight male player to relate to.\n\nSexual orientation and gender identity have served a significant role in some video games, with the trend being toward greater visibility of LGBT identities. Speaking on the Ubisoft blog, Lucien Soulband, who is openly gay and was the writer for \"\", said that openly gay or lesbian characters would not appear in video games for a long while as anything other than a one-off or something that was created through user choice as seen in the \"Mass Effect\" and \"Dragon Age\" games. The character of Dorian in was regarded as a significant development for the portrayal of gay characters in games, in that his homosexuality informs plot elements that occur regardless of whether the player decides to interact with him romantically.\n\nWith more video games featuring themes related to LGBT characters and themes, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) will include a video game awards category, the \"Outstanding Video Game Award\" for games with \"outstanding LGBTQ-inclusive content\", starting in its 30th GLAAD Media Awards.\n\nA 2008 study found that males reported playing more violent video games than females. This exposure was negatively correlated with men's certainty in their judgements when presented with a scenario of possible sexual harassment selected for its ambiguity. The exposure to violent video games was also correlated with attitudes supportive of rape.\n\nCanadian non-profit MediaSmarts writes that \"video games have the potential to influence how children perceive themselves and others\", and despite their impact on the youth, \"there is not a lot of research available in this area, and few of the existing studies stand up to critical examination. This lack of scrutiny means that we know very little about the effects that video games may have on children's development and socialization.\"\n\nAccording to Dietz, video game characters have the potential to shape players' perceptions of gender roles. Through social comparison processes, players learn societal expectations of appearances, behaviors and roles. Girls may expect that they be dependent victims and that their responsibilities include maintaining beauty and sexual appeal, while boys may determine that their role is to protect and defend women. Thus, Dietz claims, the roles internalized by the child, including gender, become for the child, and later for the adult, a basis for other roles and for action. The gender roles internalized by young individuals have a significant impact upon their perspectives and the additional roles they assume in later life. Feminine and masculine symbols are supposed to become a part of a child's identity.\n\nAlthough games that included the option of selecting a female hero obtained better review scores, they sold fewer copies than games with exclusively male protagonists. Penny Arcade Report attributed the difference to larger marketing budgets for games with male heroes. Games with a female-only protagonist had, on average, only 50% of the marketing budget of female-optional games, and 40% of the marketing budget of games with male-only protagonists. Male-only games included popular sports and war franchises such as \"Madden\" and \"Call of Duty\", and EEDAR's Jesse Divnich stated in 2010, \"The factors that drive sales are based more on brand licensing, marketing budgets, development budget and a thousand other factors that have little to do with the gender of playable avatars.\"\n\nPolling in 2015 by Pew Research Center showed 16% of adults who play video games believe most games portray women poorly, compared to 26% who disagree, and 34% who say it depends on the game. Among those who do not play, 55% are unsure if games portray women poorly. Minimal differences were seen between male and female responses.\n\nA 2015 survey of 1,583 U.S. students aged 11 to 18 by Rosalind Wiseman and Ashly Burch indicated that 60% of girls but only 39% of boys preferred to play a character of their own gender, and 28% of girls as opposed to 20% of boys said that they were more likely to play a game based on the character's gender. The authors interpreted this as meaning that the gaming industry's focus on male protagonists stifled sales to girls more than it promoted sales to boys.\n\nIn a 2017 survey of 1,266 gamers by Quantic Foundry, 89% of female gamers considered the inclusion of female protagonist option in games somewhat, very or extremely important; 64% of male gamers expressed the same views. Self-identified \"hardcore\" gamers of both genders, on average, considered a female protagonist less important than \"core\" or \"casual\" gamers did.\n\nA 2013 study showed that box art depicting sexualized female characters in non-central roles positively affected sales.\n\n"}
{"id": "27566969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27566969", "title": "Guerrilla Tarbut", "text": "Guerrilla Tarbut\n\nGuerrilla Tarbut (Hebrew: גרילה תרבות, \"Cultural Guerrilla\") is an activist group of Israeli poets. Founded in 2007, the group aims to promote social and political causes through poetry, both in Hebrew and in Arabic, performed by its members during demonstrations against social injustice.\n\nGuerrilla Tarbut's activities take a form which is somewhere between a demonstration, and a poetry reading using a megaphone. \n\nThe poets involved with Guerrilla Tarbut's activities read of their works during demonstrations. Sometimes singer-songwriters will attend also, and perform live during the activities in various musical styles. Although independent by nature, many of the group's activities are sponsored by Israeli poetry magazines, and coordinated with Israeli non-governmental organizations, including B'Tselem, New Israel Fund, and the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition. Participants include poets and musicians of various ages and artistic styles, Jews and Arabs alike.\n\nGuerrilla Tarbut's poets have also published three collections of their poems. The first collection, named \"Aduma\" (Hebrew: אדומה, \"Red\"), was published 1 May 2007 and concerned with workers' rights. The second collection, \"Latzet!\" (Hebrew: לצאת, \"Out Now!\"), was published on January 2009 as a response to the Gaza War. The third, \"Poetry Dismantles A Wall\" (Hebrew: שירה מפרקת חומה) was published on 25 March and was a bilingual collection of Arabic and Hebrew poetry against the Israeli West Bank barrier .\n\nPoets who have taken part in Guerrilla Tarbut's events include: Eran Tzelgov, Aharon Shabtai, Yudit Shahar, Roy \"Chicky\" Arad, Mati Shemoelof, Ronny Someck, Yuval Ben-Ami, Joshua Simon, Maya Bejerano, Almog Behar, Bo'az Yaniv, Ronnie Hirsch and others.\n\n\nThe group doesn't subscribe to a particular political manifesto, nor is it associated with any political party or movement. Similarly, the participating poets employ various poetical styles.\n\nThe group's activities draw significant attention in the Israeli mainstream media, and in literary circles. Yitzhak Laor, prominent leftist poet and publicist, argued that poetry cannot bring about change, and \"teaching literature in the periphery is more important than reading poetry in front of a factory\". Elsewhere, Mr. Laor hinted that Guerilla Tarbut's activity \"has emptied the term Guerrilla of al meaning\". Some poets object to the mixture of poetry and political activism, claiming that this mixture is \"narcissistic\", and self-serving for the poets themselves.\n\nThe group members, on the other hand, point out that less than a week after the poetic demonstration in the Akerstein factory in Yeruham, the hard-liner local executive was fired and some of the workers' demands were accepted. Similarly, following the demonstration in the coffee-shop in Tel Aviv, the waitresses' demands were fully granted. Each and every event gained valuable publicity for the corresponding campaign. Moreover, as one of the striking Akerstein's employees put it: \"[Guerrilla Tarbut's visit] is empowering us in our struggle, it raises our spirits.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "4137190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4137190", "title": "Halston", "text": "Halston\n\nRoy Halston Frowick (April 23, 1932 – March 26, 1990), known simply as Halston, was an American fashion designer who rose to international fame in the 1970s.\n\nHis minimalist, clean designs often made of cashmere or ultrasuede were a new phenomenon in the mid-1970s discotheques and redefined American fashion. Halston was known for creating a relaxed urban lifestyle for American women. He was frequently photographed at Studio 54 with his close friends Liza Minnelli, Bianca Jagger and artist Andy Warhol.\n\nRoy Halston Frowick was born on April 23, 1932 in Des Moines, Iowa, the second son of Norwegian-American accountant James Edward Frowick and his stay at home wife Hallie Mae (née Holmes). Halston developed an interest in sewing from his grandmother, and he began creating hats and altering clothes for his mother and sister as a boy. He grew up in Des Moines, and moved to Evansville, Indiana at the age of ten. He graduated from Benjamin Bosse High School, in 1950. He briefly attended Indiana University before enrolling at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIn 1952, Halston moved to Chicago, where he enrolled in a night course at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and he worked as a window dresser. In 1953, he opened his own hat business. His first customer was radio actress and comedian Fran Allison. Halston's hats were also bought by Kim Novak, Gloria Swanson, Deborah Kerr and Hedda Hopper.\n\nHalston's first big break came when the \"Chicago Daily News\" ran a brief story on his fashionable hats. In 1957, he opened his first shop, the Boulevard Salon, on North Michigan Avenue. It was at this point that he began to use his middle name as his professional moniker. During his childhood he had been referred to as Halston to distinguish between himself and his uncle Roy. Halston moved to New York City in late 1957, first working for milliner Lilly Daché. Within a year, he had been named the co-designer at Daché, became acquainted with several fashion editors and publishers, and left Daché's studio to become head milliner for department store Bergdorf Goodman in their customer milliner salon.\n\nHalston achieved great fame after designing the pillbox hat Jacqueline Kennedy wore to her husband's presidential inauguration in 1961, and when he moved to designing women's wear, \"Newsweek\" dubbed him \"the premier fashion designer of all America.\" When hats fell out of fashion, Halston moved on to designing clothing, made possible by Estelle Marsh, a millionaire from Amarillo, Texas. Mrs. Marsh was his sole financial backer during this critical time of development. He opened his first boutique on Madison Avenue in 1968. The collection that year included a dark jade velvet wedding gown for advertising executive Mary Wells Lawrence. Lawrence was married to the CEO of Braniff International Airways, Harding Lawrence. She would be instrumental in bringing Halston to Braniff in 1976 to design Braniff's hostess, pilot, ticket agent, and ground personnel uniforms.\n\nHalston launched his first ready-to-wear line, Halston Limited, in 1969. Halston's design was usually simple and minimalist but sophisticated, glamorous but also comfortable at the same time. Halston like to use soft, luxurious fabric like silk and chiffon. He later told \"Vogue\" that he got rid of \"...all of the extra details that didn't work—bows that didn't tie, buttons that didn't button, zippers that didn't zip, wrap dresses that didn't wrap. I've always hated things that don't work.\" Another design characteristics was the use of bias. He believed that clothes cut and sewn from the bias of every fabric can develop a sexy, polished image. In past history, people had the interpretation that shows a woman's body shape was mainly through the curve of the clothing. Halston changed the fitted silhouette and created a new definition of showing the female body shape by allowing the natural flow of the fabric to create its own shape. Halston said \"Pants give women the freedom to move around they've never had before. They don't have to worry about getting into low furniture or low sportscars. Pants will be with us for many years to come—probably forever if you can make that statement in fashion.\" In the 1970s, his ultra-suede suit was a big hit. He brought in functionality into fashion. He designed the Ultrasuede shirtdress and re-introduced pants for women. The shirtdress was interpreted as an elongated men's shirt. He also included elements of sportswear and combined it into women's clothing, merging features from both women wear and menswear together.\n\nHalston's boutique drew celebrity clients like Babe Paley, Anjelica Huston, Gene Tierney, Lauren Bacall, Margaux Hemingway, Elizabeth Taylor, Bianca Jagger and Liza Minnelli (both Jagger and Minnelli would become close friends). From 1968 to 1973, his line earned an estimated $30 million. In 1973, Halston sold his line to Norton Simon, Inc. for $16 million but remained its principal designer. This afforded him creative control with near unlimited financial backing. In 1975, Max Factor released Halston's first namesake fragrance for women. By 1977, sales from the perfume had generated $85 million in sales. Throughout the 1970s, Halston had expanded his line to include menswear, luggage, handbags, lingerie and bedding. \"Vogue\" later noted that Halston was responsible for popularizing caftans, which he made for Jacqueline Kennedy; matte jersey halter top dresses; and polyurethane in American fashion.\n\nHalston was very influential in the design of uniforms. In 1977 he was contracted by Braniff International Airways to create a new look for their flight attendants. He created muted brown uniforms with a distinctive \"H\" logo. Halston created interchangeable separates in shades of bone, tan and taupe which the airline extended to the seat covers, using brown Argentinean leather. The entire scheme was dubbed \"Ultra Touch\" by the airline in reference to Halston's ultrasuede designs, and was extremely evocative of the late 1970s. An elaborate party was thrown in February, 1977, dubbed Three Nights In Acapulco, to introduce the new Halston fashions along with the new and elegant Braniff International Airways.\n\nBraniff chairman Harding Lawrence, his wife Mary Wells Lawrence, First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, and Halston himself along with his Halstonettes were in attendance for the grand presentation. Halston and his entourage would arrive at selected points during the party in outfits that matched the deep tones of Braniff Airways' new color schemes that would be applied to their aircraft as part of the new so-called Elegance Campaign. The party and the Halston creations were a hit not only with the fashion press but also with Braniff employees, who thought they were the easiest and most comfortable uniforms they had ever worn.\n\nHe was asked by the U.S. Olympic Committee to design the Pan American Games and U.S. Olympic Team's uniforms in 1976. He also designed the uniforms for the Girl Scouts, the New York Police Department, and the Avis Rent a Car System.\n\nIn 1983, Halston signed a six-year licensing deal, worth a reported $1 billion, with the retail chain J. C. Penney. The line, called Halston III, consisted of affordable clothing, accessories, cosmetics and perfumes ranging from $24 to $200. At the time, the move was considered controversial, as no other high end designer had ever licensed their designs to a mid-priced chain retail store. While Halston was excited about the deal and felt that it would only expand his brand, the deal damaged his image with high end fashion retailers who felt that his name had been \"cheapened\". Bergdorf Goodman at the time dropped his Halston Limited line from their store shortly after plans for Halston III were announced. The Halston III line for J. C. Penney was poorly received and was eventually discontinued; however, this would pave the way for other high-end designers to sell their lines at stores of varying price levels in the future.\n\nIn 1983, Halston Limited, which was owned by Norton Simon, Inc., was acquired by Esmark Inc. After the acquisition, Halston began to lose control over his namesake company and grew frustrated. As the label changed hands (it would be owned by Playtex International, Beatrice Foods and four other companies), Halston continued to lose control and, by 1984, was banned from creating designs for Halston Enterprise. He attempted to buy back his company through protracted negotiations. Halston Enterprises was eventually acquired by Revlon in 1986. Halston was paid a salary by Revlon but had stopped designing clothing for the company but continue designing for family and friends most notably Liza Minnelli and Martha Graham. After his contract with Revlon expired, he was in talks to sign a new contract with the company but stopped negotiations after he learned that Revlon planned to continue the line without his input. The line continued on with various designers until 1990, when Revlon discontinued the clothing portion of the line but continued selling Halston perfumes.\n\nIn 1988, Halston tested positive for HIV. After his health began to fail, he moved to San Francisco, where he was cared for by his family. On March 26, 1990, he died of Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-defining illness, at the Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco. His remains were cremated.\n\nHalston's on again off again lover was Venezuelan-born artist Victor Hugo. The two met while Hugo was working as a make up artist in 1972. The two began a relationship and Hugo lived on and off in Halston's home. Halston soon hired Hugo to work as his window dresser. Their on-and-off relationship lasted a little over ten years.\n\nHalston's favored troupe of models were known as the \"Halstonettes\", and included Pat Cleveland, Anjelica Huston, Heidi Goldberg, Karen Bjornson, Beverly Johnson, Nancy North, Chris Royer, Alva Chinn, Connie Cook, and Pat Ast.\n\nIn June 1990, Halston's longtime friend, singer and actress Liza Minnelli sponsored a tribute at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall that was followed by a reception hosted by his friend Elsa Peretti.\n\nIn 2010, Halston was the subject of the documentary \"Ultrasuede: In Search of Halston\".\n\nFrom November 2014 to January 2015, a traveling exhibition entitled \"Halston and Warhol Silver and Suede\" was sponsored by the Warhol Museum and co-curated by Halston's niece Lesley Frowick.\n\nFrom February to April 2015, an exhibition was held in the museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City to celebrate Halston's 1970s fashions.\n\nIn March 2017, \"Halston Style\", a retrospective of his career, opened at the Nassau County Museum. Curated by Lesley Frowick, it features material derived from his personal archives that he gave to her before his death.\n\nAccording to fashion critic Robin Givhan, when Tom Ford relaunched Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent in the late 1990s, he found his inspiration in the glittering glamour of Halston's style: \"When Ford added Yves Saint Laurent to his workload in 1999, he did due diligence in researching the house's history. But his work continued to display a louche attitude that recalled the best of Halston.\".\n\nSince Halston's death in 1990, his namesake company changed hands several times.\n\nAfter Revlon ceased production of the clothing portion of the company in 1990, it was purchased by Borghese in 1991. In 1996, sportswear firm Tropic Tex bought the Halston clothing license (Revlon still retains the rights to Halston fragrances) and hired designer Randolph Duke to relaunch the line. Duke's first collection debuted in fall 1997 to critical acclaim. Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and Minnie Driver (who wore a crimson Halston dress to the 70th Academy Awards ceremony) were among the celebrities to wear the new Halston creations. By 1998, Duke left the company after it was sold to Catterton-Simon, a private equity fund. In 1998, African-American designer, Kevin Hall was hired to design the collection. He left Halston in 2000.\n\nIn 1999, Catterton-Simon sold Halston Enterprises to Neema Clothing. Neema's owner, James J. Ammeen, planned to relaunch the Halston line as a luxury brand and hired designer Bradley Bayou. Bayou's line, Bradley Bayou for Halston, was worn by Oprah Winfrey and Queen Latifah. Bayou left Halston in 2005 after Ammeen refused to give Bayou more money for advertising.\n\nIn 2006, Jimmy Choo co-founder Tamara Mellon, stylist Rachel Zoe, and film producer Harvey Weinstein partnered with Hilco Consumer Capital to purchase the line in another effort to relaunch it. Problems about the line's new direction quickly arose when Tamara Mellon and Rachel Zoe could not agree on a designer. Former Versace designer Marco Zanini was eventually hired in July 2007. Zoe later said she was disappointed with Zanini's designs and was shut out of the designing process.\n\nZanini's Halston collection debuted in February 2008 to mixed reviews. Zanini left Halston in July 2008 and British designer, Marios Schwab, was hired in May 2009. Halston Enterprises then decided to launch a second line called Halston Heritage. The Heritage line is based on archived sketches by Halston with modern updates. In 2009 actress Sarah Jessica Parker wore two Halston Heritage dresses in the film \"Sex and the City 2\" and the company hired her as the president and chief creative officer for the main line. She also oversaw the Halston Heritage line.\n\nIn February 2011, Marios Schwab released his first Halston collection for the Autumn/Winter season. During her tenure as Creative Director, Sarah Jessica Parker choose iconic jeweler Jacqueline Rabun to design a selection of custom-made silver accessories. \n\nNevertheless, Schwab's collection debuted to negative critical reception. In the August 2011 issue of American \"Vogue\", Sarah Jessica Parker revealed that she had left the company. Schwab and Harvey Weinstein left the company shortly thereafter.\n\nIn late 2011, Hilco Consumer Capital consolidated ownership and brought in Ben Malka, former president of BCBG, to continue the Halston Heritage business as Chairman and CEO. Malka enlisted the help of Marie Mazelis, the former creative director of Max Azria and Hervé Léger, to spearhead the re-launch of the contemporary line. Hilco decided to focus exclusively on the Halston Heritage ready-to-wear activity, and invested an additional $7.5 million for its development.\n\nIn September 2012, the company moved its headquarters from New York to Los Angeles. In February 2013, Halston Heritage signed a deal with the Majid Al Futtaim Group for distribution of its products in the United Arab Emirates. In 2015, the company sold H by Halston and H Halston to the company Xcel that specializes in bringing fairly known brands to mass market outlets.\n\nThe fall 2018 collection was focused on athleisure apparels.\n\nHalston is based in Los Angeles, California. The Halston collection includes ready-to-wear, dresses, handbags, footwear and small leather goods, and is known for silhouettes including jumpsuits, shirtdresses, kaftans, and one-shoulder styles. The brand is distributed throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, the Middle East (Kuwait and United Arab Emirates), and Mexico City.\n\n"}

Between 1977 and 2006, he damaged over 50 paintings worth more than 270 million Deutsche Marks (about 138 million euro) by such artists as Rubens, Rembrandt and Dürer.\n\nBohlmann was born in Breslau (modern Wrocław).\n\nSince his youth, Bohlmann suffered from a serious personality disorder. At the age of 16, he voluntarily went to the psychiatric clinic of the University of Kiel and underwent electric shock and insulin treatments. Around that time, he was a plumber apprentice, but could not focus on a single occupation and was doing various jobs. He had several therapy courses involving tranquilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, behavior therapy and group therapy, but with very limited success.\n\nIn 1968, Bohlmann married and worked for six years at a warehouse. He then frequently took valium and haloperidol and regularly attended church masses. In 1974, he met the neurosurgeon Dieter Müller from the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf who suggested a lobotomy treatment. Although Müller predicted a 75–80% chance of success, the operation brought no improvement. It was later criticized as obsolete and merely reduced Bohlmann's intelligence. On 11 March 1977, his wife fell from a window while cleaning and died from injuries soon after. According to Bohlmann, the death of his wife turned him to vandalism. Previously, he often visited museums with his wife and saw the importance of art in society. He then started to buy sulfuric acid at pharmacies and spray it on paintings.\n\nHis vandalism began on 16 March 1977 in a city park and followed on 29 March 1977 in Kunsthalle Hamburg, where he damaged the painting \"Golden Fish\" by Paul Klee. It was followed by other attacks in Hamburg, Lübeck, Lüneburg, Essen, Dortmund, Hannover, Bochum, Kassel, Düsseldorf and Hamelin. On 16 August 1977, he poured sulfuric acid on several artworks including portraits of Martin Luther and his wife Katharina von Bora by Lucas Cranach the Elder in the Lower Saxony State Museum of Hanover. On 24 August 1977, he damaged the painting \"Archduke Albrecht\" by Rubens in Düsseldorf and on 7 October 1977 four paintings in Schloss Wilhelmshöhe in Kassel, estimated at more than 25 million euros, among them Rembrandt's , a self-portrait by Rembrandt and Willem Drost's \"Noli me tangere\". In his attacks, Bohlmann was primarily targeting the faces of the personages, trying to inflict maximum damage. Bohlmann's activity was not restricted to paintings and museums; he ignited an altar in Lübeck and sprayed hundreds of tombstones with swastikas at night in Hamburg. The resultant outrage in the press encouraged him. As he felt he was becoming a celebrity, he abandoned the antidepressant drugs he had been taking.\n\nBohlmann was arrested in October 1977 and in 1979 convicted by the Hamburg Regional Court to five years in prison for 17 cases of damage to public property, 3 cases of damage to private property and one case of cruelty to animals. He served the term in full until 6 October 1982. After release from prison, Bohlmann resumed vandalism. He was then banned from buying acid and instead committed arson at a construction site near Hamburg inflicting damage estimated at 65,000 euros. For this crime, the Hamburg Regional Court sentenced him to three years ending on 5 May 1986. A part of his pension was seized for the damage done to Ruben's \"Archduke Albrecht\", and in the autumn of 1987 he went for treatment in the psychiatric department of the Hospital Hamburg-Eilbek.\n\nIn March 1988, Bohlmann bought two litres of sulfuric acid and hid them in a park. On 20 April 1988, he took a leave from the hospital and the next day splashed acid on three paintings by Albrecht Dürer in Munich's Alte Pinakothek, namely \"Lamentation for Christ\", \"Paumgartner Altar\" and inflicting damage estimated at 35 million euros. Immediately after the attacks, he was arrested and held in the psychiatric hospital of Haar, Bavaria. In 1989 he was convicted by the Munich District Court to a two-year imprisonment, concurrent with treatment as long as necessary in a psychiatric hospital, and in March 1990 transferred to the clinic in Hamburg-Ochsenzoll. Bohlmann escaped from the facility in January 1998 and after being at large for two days he was found at a subway station, possibly on the way back to the hospital. On 30 July 2001 he escaped again but returned to hospital the next morning.\n\nIn Ochsenzoll he attended art therapy and for nine years painted pictures, almost every day, with a total number of about 1,500. In January 2005, more than 16 years after his arrest in Munich, Bohlmann was released to public life. On 25 June 2006, in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, he splashed lighter fuel on the painting \"\" (1648) by Bartholomeus van der Helst and set fire to it. Most damage was to the varnish layer. Bohlmann was sentenced to 3 years by the court in Amsterdam. After serving two-thirds of the sentence, on 24 June 2008 he was released from prison, returned to Hamburg and died there on 19 January 2009 of cancer.\n\n"}

The film's focus is also on the community of the district and its townscape. \"No Quarto da Vanda\" follows the drama film \"Ossos\" (1997) in which Vanda Duarte plays as an actress.\n\nThe film took a year to shoot after the (mostly) one-person crew settled in the location, \"Fontainhas district\", where Vanda and the community including Cape Verdean immigrants lived depressed lives.\n\nIn spite of its three-hour length, the director Pedro Costa made the film in a realist style by using fixed shots entirely. Melancholic life of the community was shot on DV in a low-key way. Costa said about his impression of the district:\n\nWhen I entered the Fontainhas area, there were colors and smells that made me remember the things and events of the past, and also ideas about people to which I am attracted. These ideas nestled close to each other, living together even as they led very solitary lives because of violent and painful separation. A form of interesting and incompatible relationships existed in this.\n\nThe film also sees this shanty district slowly being demolished. The displaced inhabitants are featured in Costa's next film \"Juventude em Marcha\" (\"Colossal Youth\", 2006).\n\nDespite its highly fictional nature, its elusive classification and its documentary-like hybridization allowed it to win the FIPRESCI Prize at the Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival in 2001 \"for presenting life in its near-original form\".\n\nPedro Costa collected the France Culture Award (Foreign Cineaste of the Year) for directing the film at 2002 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1363068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1363068", "title": "Isis Unveiled", "text": "Isis Unveiled\n\nIsis Unveiled: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology, published in 1877, is a book of esoteric philosophy and Helena Petrovna Blavatsky's first major work and a key text in her Theosophical movement. \n\nThe work has often been criticized as a plagiarized occult work, with scholars noting how Blavatsky extensively copied from a large number of sources popular among occultists at the time. However, \"Isis Unveiled\" is nevertheless also understood by modern scholars to be a milestone in the history of Western Esotericism.\n\nThe work was originally entitled \"The Veil of Isis\", a title which remains on the heading of each page, but had to be renamed once Blavatsky discovered that this title had already been used for an 1861 Rosicrucian work by W.W. Reade. \"Isis Unveiled\" is divided into two volumes. Volume I, \"The 'Infallibility' of Modern Science\", discusses occult science and the hidden and unknown forces of nature, exploring such subjects as forces, elementals, psychic phenomena, and the Inner and Outer Man. Volume II, \"Theology\", discusses the similarity of Christian scripture to Eastern religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, the Vedas, and Zoroastrianism. It follows the Renaissance notion of \"prisca theologia\", in that all these religions purportedly descend from a common source; the ancient \"Wisdom-Religion\". Blavatsky writes in the preface that \"Isis Unveiled\" is \"a plea for the recognition of the Hermetic philosophy, the anciently universal Wisdom-Religion, as the only possible key to the Absolute in science and theology.\"\n\n\"Isis Unveiled\" is argued by many modern scholars such as Bruce F. Campbell and Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke to be a milestone in the history of Western Esotericism. Blavatsky gathered a number of themes central to the occult tradition—perennial philosophy, a Neo-Platonic emanationist cosmology, adepts, esoteric Christianity—and reinterpreted them in relation to current developments in science and new knowledge of non-Western faiths. In doing so, \"Isis Unveiled\" reflected many contemporary controversies—such as Darwin's theories on evolution and their impact on religion—and engaged in a discussion that appealed to intelligent individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms. Blavatsky's combination of original insights, backed by scholarly and scientific sources, accomplished a major statement of modern occultism's defiance of materialist science.\n\nIn later theosophical works some of the doctrines originally stated in \"Isis Unveiled\" appeared in a significantly altered form, drawing out confusion among readers and even causing some to perceive contradiction. Specifically, the few and—according to many—ambiguous statements on reincarnation as well as the threefold conception of man as body, soul and spirit of \"Isis Unveiled\" stand in contrast to the elaborate and definite conception of reincarnation as well as the sevenfold conception of man in \"The Secret Doctrine\" (1888). Blavatsky later asserted the correctness of her statements on reincarnation and the constitution of man in \"Isis Unveiled\", attributing the resulting confusion and alleged contradictions to the more superficial or simplified conceptions of the ideas in \"Isis Unveiled\" compared to those of later works.\n\nModern Theosophists hold the book as a revealed work dictated to Blavatsky by Theosophy's Masters.\n\nDetractors often accuse the book of extensive unattributed plagiarism, a view first seriously put forth by William Emmette Coleman shortly after publication and still expressed by modern scholars such as Mark Sedgwick. Similarly, Geoffrey Ashe notes that \"Isis Unveiled\" combines \"comparative religion, occultism, pseudoscience, and fantasy in a mélange that shows genuine if superficial research but is not free from unacknowledged borrowing and downright plagiarism.\" Indeed, \"Isis Unveiled\" makes use of a large number of sources popular among occultists at the time, often directly copying significant amounts of text. However, rather than dwelling on the plagiarism, scholars such as Bruce Campbell argue: \"Blavatsky was a person who had an original set of insights but who lacked the literary skills and knowledge of English sufficient to create a work on her own. Relying on written sources and help from friends, she formulated a unique and powerful expression of occult ideas.\" Joscelyn Godwin and K. Paul Johnson note that early scholarship seemed obsessed with the agenda of exposing Helena Blavatsky as a plagiarist and imposter, but such labels do not properly assess the Theosophical Society's place in the cultural, political, religious, and intellectual history of modern times. The work belongs to a broader movement that seeks to integrate the history of the occult sciences and of esoteric movements with more established subdisciplines. Modern copies of \"Isis Unveiled\" are often annotated, fully delineating Blavatsky's sources and influences.\n\nHistorian Ronald H. Fritze considers \"Isis Unveiled\" to be a work of pseudohistory. Likewise, Henry R. Evans, a contemporaneous journalist and magician, described the book as a \"hodge-podge of absurdities, pseudo-science, mythology and folk-lore, arranged in helter-skelter fashion, with an utter disregard of logical sequence.\" One of Blavatsky's original goals in writing \"Isis Unveiled\" and founding the Theosophical Society was to reconcile contemporary advances in science with occultism, and this synthesis was one of the main appeals of Blavatsky's work for individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms at the time. Theosophy adopted and addressed many ideas from late nineteenth century science. Some, like Darwin's theory of evolution, have continued to be accepted by the scientific community, while others, like the continent of Lemuria, though based on contemporaneous scientific theories, have long since been rendered obsolete by modern advances. Theosophy and Occultism as a whole gained a level of sophistication through the adoption of religious terms largely absent from the preceding Spiritualism movement. However, as Theosophy continued to grow as a religion, it became stuck with certain scientific ideas even after they had been discarded by the scientific community. The inability to adapt to scientific progress presents a disparity between modern Theosophy and the society's original motivations. K. Paul Johnson also notes that many of the more mythical elements of Blavatsky's works, like her later Masters, rather than being outright inventions, were reformulations of preexisting esoteric ideas and the casting of a large group of individuals—who helped, encouraged, or collaborated with her—under a mythological context; all driven by Blavatsky's search for spiritual truth.\n\nSten Bodvar Liljegren notes that in addition to contemporaneous occult sources and the prevailing orientalism of the period, the novels of Edward Bulwer-Lytton heavily influenced Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas.\n\n\n\n"}

They move scenery and props on stage, aiding in scene changes and costume changes. They will also often play the role of animals, will-o-the-wisps, or other roles which are played not by an actor in full costume, but by holding a prop. \"Kuroko\" wear all black, head to toe, in order to imply that they are invisible and not part of the action onstage.\n\nThe convention of wearing black to imply that the wearer is invisible on stage is a central element in \"bunraku\" puppet theatre as well. \"Kuroko\" will wear white or blue in order to blend in with the background in a scene set, for example, in a snowstorm, or at sea, in which case they are referred to as or respectively. As this convention was extended to kabuki actors depicting stealthy ninja, historian Stephen Turnbull suggested that the stereotypical image of a ninja dressed all in black derived from kabuki. The theatrical convention of dressing ninja characters as apparent stagehands to imply stealth and to surprise audiences contributed to this popular image, in contrast to the historical reality that real ninjas usually dressed like civilians.\n\nIn Noh theatre, a \"kōken\", wearing black but no mask, serves much the same purpose.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28993191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28993191", "title": "Lamba (garment)", "text": "Lamba (garment)\n\nA lamba is the traditional garment worn by men and women that live in Madagascar. The textile, highly emblematic of Malagasy culture, consists of a rectangular length of cloth wrapped around the body.\n\nTraditional lambas used for burial were often made of silk and cow hides while those for daily wear were more often made of raffia, pig skin, cotton or bast. They could range in color from a tie-dyed mess or solid white cloth, to striped red, white and black cloth found in most parts of the island, the geometric patterns in unique shades of green and brown produced by a handful of Sakalava villages, or the brilliantly multi-colored, complex weaves favored by the pre-colonial Merina aristocracy. Today, it is common to find printed cotton or rayon lambas produced in India for the Malagasy market in addition to those fabricated locally.\n\nBesides its daily use as basic clothing, the lamba is also used for tying children to mothers' backs or as a cushion when carrying a heavy object on top of the head. The lamba is also used ritually to wrap the remains of the dead before placing them in the family tomb. Which after the ceremony are then \nplaced on the dead for an order of respect to their souls.\n\nThe term \"lamba\" is the name in the Highlands dialect of the woven cloth that traditionally formed the essential article of clothing throughout Madagascar. This garment is known by other words in various regions where other dialects are spoken; in some parts of the east, for instance, the garment is known by the word \"simbo\". Many of the ways in which the cloth may be wrapped around the wearer are specified by a wide variety of terms that vary from region to region. The color, print and type of cloth varies from region to region. The largest lambas (\"lambamena\") are made of a heavy white silk and are used to wrap the bodies of the deceased before placing them in the family tomb. Among some ethnic groups, lambas were also traditionally exchanged between a man and woman as part of their engagement ceremony, or as diplomatic gifts, as demonstrated by the two detailed silk \"lamba akotofahana\" (one multicolored, the other white-on-white) given in 1886 to President Grover Cleveland by Queen Ranavalona III on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art.\n\nThere are numerous types of lambas produced in Madagascar. The names can serve to distinguish the material used, pattern type, ritual purpose of the garment or the intended wearer. Names of lambas vary from one region to the next according to local dialects, so the list below is not exhaustive but rather representative of some of the most commonly distinguishable types of lamba.It is many types in Madagascar\n\nA printed cotton lamba typically featuring a proverb on the lower border of the design, identical to the kangas worn throughout eastern Africa. The lambahoany is presently the most commonly worn type of lamba. These are traditionally made of printed cotton featuring a repeated border design that encloses either a secondary pattern (often around a central medallion) or a large image depicting a pastoral scene from daily life. A popular proverb, or \"ohabolana\", is typically written just above the center of the lower border. \nThe uses of the ubiquitous lambahoany are numerous and varied. They are often wrapped to attach an infant to its mother's back, freeing her hands for other uses. They may also serve as light blankets, sheets, an apron, a transport sack, a table cloth or a sunshade, and when tightly coiled they can be used as a cushion when carrying heavy objects on top of the head.\n\nA woven silk lamba featuring highly complex geometric designs.\n\nA ceremonial lamba traditionally worn by nobles, the wealthy, or elders.\n\nA silk burial shroud.\n\nA traditional lamba made of a blend of silk and cotton.\n\nA traditional lamba made of a blend of silk and raffia fibers.\n\nA traditional Sakalava raffia lamba commonly decorated with geometric ikat-dyed patterns and often used as a burial shroud.\nIt is still a tradition in Madagascar..\n\nA lamba worn as a loincloth, measuring about 30 cm wide and 300 cm long.\n\nThe style of wearing the lamba likewise varies between regions and according to the gender of the wearer. Both sexes will wrap it around the waist, much like a sarong. Women will also wear it wrapped over or beneath the bust to form a sheath dress, often with matching lamba headdress. These styles can be paired with a tank top or other light shirt.\n\nMen may drape the lamba over one shoulder as a shawl over shorts or – in cooler weather – over a \"malabary,\" a long-sleeved, knee-length cotton tunic. Traditionally, the lamba is draped over the left shoulder but is draped over the right when in mourning. Among mature Merina and (to a lesser extent) Betsileo women, wearing a narrower version of the traditionally white lamba around the shoulders is a mark of \"elegance, dignity, femininity and respect for tradition.\"\n\nNarrow lambas may be worn like a sash. Men drape them diagonally across the chest or knot them around the waist, while women may wear them loosely over the shoulders. The sash-like fashion was popularized due to European influence and is especially typical of the costume of hiragasy dancers.\n\nTraditional lambas were most often woven on horizontal ground looms, the most common type of loom found in Madagascar. The weaver was most often a woman and would be seated to one side of the loom as she worked the threads. For many women, weaving formed a basic domestic responsibility required to produce clothing for family members. Surplus could be sold to supplement family income; this occurred most often among the Merina and Betsileo of the Highlands.\n\nThe \"lamba akotofahana,\" the highly colorful lamba weaving style associated with the Merina aristocracy, consisted of complex geometric designs created by the uniquely Merina practice of using extra heddles across the loom to create raised bands of pattern. This striking statement of andriana class distinction in the imperial era was preserved in a toned-down form under colonial rule: the same intricate patterns were retained but the designs were woven in white-on-white to draw less attention to the statement of class and ethnic identity they made.\n\nIn recent years, the interest in (and demand for) traditional, highly-colored \"lamba akotofahana\" has increased among well-to-do Malagasy expatriates, tourists and textile aficionados, which has led to a resurgence in their production and sale in fine art galleries in Antananarivo. Contemporary artists have turned their attention to the resurrection of these ancient, half-forgotten techniques, producing unique works of art featured in exhibitions at internationally renowned museums. At the American Museum of Natural History, for instance, a \"lamba akotofahana\" was displayed that had been woven entirely from the silk threads produced by the female golden orb-weaver spider. A \"lamba akotofahana\" exhibiting the full range of colors and detailed patterns of the shawls worn by pre-colonial nobles, woven by artist Martin Rakotoarimanana, has likewise been recently displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\n"}

The campaign encouraged peasants from all over China to follow from the example of the farmers of Dazhai village, Shanxi, by practicing self-sacrifice and upright political activity.\n\nIt grew in importance after the introduction of the Cultural Revolution, but Chen Yonggui and its other proponents were eventually eased out of power by Deng Xiaoping following the removal of the Gang of Four.\n\nSlogans associated with Dazhai included: \"Move the mountains to make farm fields,\" \"Change the sky and alter the land,\" \"Work bitterly, diligently, and with extra energy, and build our village into a Dazhai-like one in three years.\"\n\nDuring the years until the downfall of the Gang of Four in 1976, particularly the Cultural Revolution, farmers from all over the country were organized to visit Dazhai, and well-trained tour guides took posts at important scenes to explain to visitors how the villagers in Daizhai made such achievements with their own hands. One of such scenes was the top of the Tiger Head Mountain where visitors could have a panoramic view of the farm fields, the major irrigation projects as well as the residential area of the villagers. Perhaps hundreds of millions of farmers visited the place during the period and the expenses on their trips were paid by the government.\n\nAt this time, farmers throughout China were expected to show their political zeal in following Mao Zedong's directive \"Learn from Dazhai in agriculture\" (\"农业|学大寨\"). They not only worked during the day, but at night as well, not only in the warm season, but in the depth of winter—a dramatic deviation from their age-old practice. In many places, the farmers literally—and blindly—moved hills (sometimes proclaimed as \"mountains\"), built reservoirs, tunnels, canals, and so on. As mental motivation, loud speakers were installed at work sites to broadcast music and songs and films were shown at night on the scene while the farmers took a break. \n\nMeanwhile, a number of leaders of the village made dramatic advances in their political careers. Chen Yonggui, the patriarchal leader of the village, was put to the position of vice premier of the central government despite the fact that he was only semiliterate. (Zhou Enlai was the premier of the time.) Guo Fenglian, the Dazhai party secretary, was a favorite of Jiang Qing (the wife of Mao Zedong), and played a significant part in the Chinese political scene.\n\nThis campaign was as much political as it was agricultural, and it came to an abrupt end upon Mao's death in 1976. After the victory of Deng Xiaoping over Hua Guofeng, Chen Yonggui, and others following the removal of the Gang of Four from power, his economic reforms has caused Dazhai to become a figure of ridicule, since it was so closely linked to Maoist communal agriculture and socialist propaganda.\n\nToday, Dazhai is a regional tourist attraction.\n\n"}

Bamboo tubes and soft brushes of various sizes are used for laying powders and drawing fine lines. As it requires highly skilled craftsmanship to produce a maki-e painting, young artists usually go through many years of training to develop the skills and to ultimately become maki-e masters. Kōami Dōchō (1410–1478) was the first lacquer master linked to specific works. His maki-e works used designs from various Japanese contemporary painters. Kōami and another maki-e master, Igarashi Shinsai, were originators of the two major schools of lacquer-making in the history of Japan.\n\nTakamakie (or \"raised maki-e\") is one of the three major techniques in maki-e making. Developed in the Muromachi period (1336–1573), the technique of takamakie involves building up design patterns above the surface through a mixture of metal powder, lacquer, and charcoal or clay dust.\n\nAnother special kind of maki-e is togidashi maki-e, where a black lacquer without oil is put on the metal decoration as an additional coat.\n\n\n"}

This painting is from Dalí's paranoiac-critical period. According to Greek mythology, Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection in a pool. Unable to embrace the watery image, he pined away, and the gods immortalized him as a flower. Dalí completed this painting in 1937 on his long-awaited return to Paris after having had great success in the United States.\n\nThe painting shows Narcissus sitting in a pool, gazing down. Not far away there is a decaying stone figure which corresponds closely to him but is perceived quite differently; as a hand holding up a bulb or egg from which a Narcissus is growing. The egg has been used as a symbol for sexuality in other paintings by Dalí. In the background, a group of naked figures can be seen, while a third Narcissus like figure appears on the horizon.\n\nDalí wrote the following poem, which accompanied the painting when it was initially exhibited:\n"}
{"id": "13698883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13698883", "title": "More Fire! Productions", "text": "More Fire! Productions\n\nMore Fire! Productions was a women's theatre collective active in New York City from 1980 to 1988. It was founded by Robin Epstein and Dorothy Cantwell and based in the East Village section of lower Manhattan, New York City. More Fire! Productions created and produced eight full-length plays between 1980 and 1988, becoming known as \"one of the city's leading women's theatre groups\" for its contributions to the downtown, experimental theatre and women's and lesbian theatre scenes of the 1980s. Epstein and Cantwell co-wrote, produced, and performed in the company's first three plays: \"As the Burger Broils\" (1980), \"The Exorcism of Cheryl\" (1981), and \"Junk Love\" (1981), which had numerous runs and became a neighborhood cult classic, \"the longest running show on Avenue A.\" Epstein then wrote and produced \"The Godmother\" (1983). Novelist and writer Sarah Schulman joined the company in 1983 and collaborated on the writing and performing of three later plays: \"Art Failures\" (1983), \"Whining and Dining\" (1984), and \"Epstein on the Beach\" (1985). The final play, \"Beyond Bedlam\" (1987), was written and produced by Epstein, who was the only person involved in all More Fire! plays.\n\nAlong with Epstein and Cantwell, another founding member of More Fire! was Stephanie Doba, who collaborated on and performed in six More Fire! plays. In the mid-1970s Doba was working at The Kosciuszko Foundation, a Polish-American non-profit organization having its headquarters in New York City. She was asked by Polish theatre director Jerzy Grotowski to help facilitate the participation of Americans in the \"Tree of People,\" a new project of his Polish Laboratory Theatre. Grotowski's work at that time embodied a search for authentic expression through improvisation and interaction among participants, rather than performance for audiences. Cantwell and Doba met as participants in the Tree of People project in Wroclaw, Poland, in the winter of 1979.\n\nGrotowski's focus on improvisatory expression matched and nurtured a strong interest in movement improvisation in the downtown community of the East Village in the late 1970s. Open Movement, the weekly participatory event held at Performance Space 122 (also known as P.S. 122), became a regular meeting ground for New York and European dancers, actors and other artists, a number of whom had taken part in Grotowski's projects. Cantwell, Doba and Epstein were all regular participants in Open Movement. Cantwell and Doba began collaborating with Epstein, who was then primarily a painter, to create an avant-garde, experimental theatre style.\n\nAnother founding member was Marianne Willtorp, now a member of the Swedish Film Institute (Svenska Filminstitutet). Willtorp collaborated on and performed in \"The Exorcism of Cheryl\", \"Junk Love\", and \"The Godmother\". Willtorp's 1981 documentary film \"More Fire!\" explores the making of the collective's first original experimental play, \"As the Burger Broils\", which used the movement and physicality of restaurant work to create theatre. The film shows the company's improvisational use of restaurant movement and language, and its real-life context in Epstein and Cantwell's lives as busy East Village artists and actresses who earned their livings as waitresses.\n\nAs co-founders of More Fire! Productions, Epstein and Cantwell shared a joint vision and aesthetic. Cantwell's writing and acting abilities were crucial to the company's early success. Her primary interest was in creating a passionate, funny, excessive style of acting, using characters and situations drawn with broad strokes and shameless exaggeration. Cantwell's ability to improvise and understanding of theatre inspired and shaped Epstein's own theatrical vision, which also developed out of her work as a painter, interest in popular film, and background as a working-class Jewish New Yorker. More Fire! used the superficial appearance of autobiography––particularly Epstein's––as a framework for the satirical exploration of a variety of themes and genres, including the confessional style of some East Village performance art. The company's style developed through collaborative improvising and writing, with lesbians and straight women working together to create and sustain an avant-garde, alternative theatre company.\n\nIn 1983, Cantwell began to perform with Good Medicine and Company, founded by carlos ricardo martinez and downtown actor/playwright Jeff Weiss. She performed in carlos ricardo martinez's \"Teddy and the Social Worker\" and \"Art the Rat\". She starred with Jeff Weiss in his long-running, episodic show, \". . . and That's How the Rent Gets Paid (Part IV)\". Cantwell also performed with Weiss and members of the Wooster Group, including Ron Vawter and Willem Dafoe, at the Performing Garage. In 1987, Cantwell debuted on Broadway (at the Longacre Theatre) in Circle Repertory Company's production of John Bishop's \"The Musical Comedy Murders of 1940\".\n\nEpstein, who has been called the \"lesbian equivalent of Woody Allen,\" continued as the central creative and organizing force behind More Fire! until she decided to disband the company in 1988. She was involved in every aspect of the production end as well as the artistic creation and design. She wrote, often in collaboration with others, all eight More Fire! experimental plays, performed in them, designed sets and painted scenery, created popular music soundtracks, and wrote songs.\n\nEpstein's later work with More Fire! includes \"Beyond Bedlam\" and three plays written in collaboration with Sarah Schulman: \"Art Failures\", \"Whining and Dining\", and \"Epstein On the Beach\". Other downtown performers appeared with the company, including Stephanie Skura in the title role in \"The Godmother\", Jennifer Miller in \"Whining and Dining\" and \"Epstein on the Beach\", and Holly Hughes in \"Whining and Dining\". Writer and performer Deb Margolin contributed monologues for \"The Godmother\" and \"Beyond Bedlam\", and a guest appearance in \"Junk Love\". Some productions (\"Junk Love\" and \"Epstein on the Beach\") also included male actors, such as actor/playwright Paul Walker and comic Jerry Turner.\n\nMore Fire! Productions developed a following among East Village theatre audiences. East Village, women's, and New York gay and lesbian publications commented on the company's energy, inventiveness, broad humor, and satire of the downtown arts scene. \"Other Stages\" described \"Junk Love\" as \"savagely witty\" and praised the company's \"original and daring performers.\" The \"New York Native\" called \"Whining and Dining\" \"theater as carnival.\" \"The Flue\", published by Franklin Furnace, an avant-garde art and performance space, noted that \"the business is fast and funny, ferociously local.\" The \"East Village Eye\" wrote of \"Art Failures\": \"Perhaps Epstein and Schulman's greatest achievement was their ability to crystalize the contradictions at the heart of the theatre/performance world. . . . Along the way Epstein and Schulman knowingly poke fun at themselves and lots of other talented individuals.\" \n\nPerformances by More Fire! received mixed reviews in \"The New York Times\" and \"Village Voice\". Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"Obviously, ensembles like More Fire!, which has earned a loyal cult following, are determined to remain outside of the mainstream.\" C. Carr of the \"Village Voice\" wrote of \"Epstein on the Beach\": \"Parts of the show were quite funny––especially a parody of \"Quarry\" which managed to recreate and mock many of the visual high points of Meredith Monk's classic within a few minutes. But the gist of the story––that 'hypocrisy is the spice of life' and lesbians will sell out as fast as the next person––made it . . . cynical.\" The harshest commentary came from Alisa Solomon, also of the \"Village Voice\", who reviewed \"Art Failures\" after audience members sent hundreds of postcards demanding a review. Although the postcards were part of the performance, Solomon saw them as a \"cry for reviews\" and described the play as \"politically irresponsible. . . . Instead of taking potshots from a fortress of self-indulgence, why not seriously engage issues of capitalist patriarchy?\"\n\nMost productions were performed at the University of the Streets, located on Seventh Street and Avenue A in the East Village\". As the Burger Broils\" previewed at P.S. 122's Avant-Garde-Arama and then became the first full-length public play or performance ever to be presented in P.S. 122, in October 1980. In 1981, More Fire! participated in the Second Women's One World (WOW) Festival of women's and lesbian theatre, in New York City, where the company performed \"The Exorcism of Cheryl\" and an excerpt from \"Junk Love\". \"The Exorcism of Cheryl\" was also performed at the 1981 Boston Women's Theatre Festival. In 1986, The Performing Garage hosted a More Fire! Productions retrospective that included performances of \"Junk Love\" and \"Epstein on the Beach\".\n\nIn April 2008, the More Fire! Productions archive, including scripts, photographs, reviews, production notes, and videos, was donated to NYC's Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12231331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12231331", "title": "National Indigenous Television", "text": "National Indigenous Television\n\nNational Indigenous Television (NITV) is an Australian television channel that broadcasts programming produced largly by Indigenous Australians.\n\nNITV was initially only carried by cable and satellite providers, along with some limited over-the-air transmissions in certain remote areas. However, in 2010, the Australian Government commissioned a wide-ranging review of its investment in the Indigenous broadcasting and media sector. The review was headed up by retired senior public servant Neville Stevens with the assistance of Expert Panel members Laurie Patton and Kerrynne Liddle. The review recommended that NITV continue to receive government funding only on the basis that it was re-structured.\n\nSubsequently, Communications Minister Senator Stephen Conroy invited NITV to enter in negotiations with the Special Broadcasting Service to access one of that network's unused digital terrestrial channels. SBS took over the management and operation of NITV on 1 July 2012, and the network was re-launched as a free-to-air channel on Freeview channel 34 on 12 December 2012.\n\nIndigenous groups and individuals lobbied the Australian Government to fund a nationwide Indigenous television service in the 1980s and 1990s, however no major political party championed this cause.\n\nIn the late 1990s the Imparja Info Channel (also known as \"Channel 31\") was launched free-to-view on the satellite Optus Aurora service, providing largely Aboriginal programming direct to homes and via network of BRACS transmitters to remote Aboriginal communities. The Aboriginal programming on this channel later became known as Indigenous Community Television.\n\nIn 2004, Imparja stated a desire to run a better funded service, at least within its license area. In the same year, a voluntary NITV Committee was formed and a summit was held in Redfern, Sydney. The summit involved a group of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander media professionals and community members committed to the establishment of a national Indigenous broadcasting service.\n\nIn 2005 the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts considered funding an indigenous public broadcaster, and subsequently conducted a review process. Following the conclusion of the report, the Government of Australia announced $48.5 million in funding for NITV.\n\nIn 2007, NITV established a head office in Alice Springs and a television arm in Sydney. On 13 July 2007 NITV launched, replacing Imparja Info Channel on Optus Aurora and in the remote Aboriginal communities it previously reached. It soon after also became available free-to-air on Optus D1 to Australia and eastern Papua New Guinea .\n\nNITV announced in September 2007 that it would also launch on Australian subscription television services, and has commenced on 1 November 2007 on Foxtel and Austar's satellite service on channel 180, with it becoming available on its cable service soon after. It shows Australian programs and sports like \"The Marngrook Footy Show\", and the annual \"NSW Aboriginal Rugby League Knockout\".\nOn 30 April 2010, NITV ceased broadcasting on Sydney's digital television Datacasting service along with Teachers TV, Australian Christian Channel, the home shopping channel EXPO and other services. However, it remained available on subscription services Foxtel, Austar and Optus TV.\n\nOn 8 May 2012, SBS received $158m in government funding, of which $15m a year would be dedicated to a new free to air Indigenous Australian channel which would replace NITV in July 2012, with 90% of staff transferring to this new channel. NITV was re-launched on 12 December 2012 by SBS as a free-to-air channel on Freeview channel 34. Among its launch day programmes were two live broadcasts from Uluru, including \"From the Heart of Our Nation\", a two-hour event to mark the channel's launch at Noon, and a concert in primetime simulcast by SBS One.\n\nOn 29 February 2016, SBS unveiled a refreshed brand and revamped schedule for NITV with an increased focus on its central charter, indigenous news and current affairs.\n\nNITV News, is the network's national news program which is broadcast nightly, covering stories relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander viewers. NITV's line-up focuses on programming of interest to and showcasing indigenous Australians, such as documentaries, current affairs programs, sports, drama, adult animation and a block of domestic and international children's programming focusing on Indigenous and Aboriginal culture (under the name \"Jarjums\"), and films. It also broadcasts programs relating to First Nations culture worldwide.\n\n\n"}

Her reports air regularly on NPR's newsmagazines \"All Things Considered, Morning Edition\", and \"Weekend Edition\". From 1992 to 2013, she was also a panelist on the syndicated TV political commentary show \"Inside Washington\".\n\n\"Newsweek\" magazine called her \"the creme de la creme\" of NPR, and \"Vanity Fair\" refers to her as \"Queen of the Leaks\". She has won many broadcast journalism awards for both her explanatory pieces and her scoops.\n\nAmong her scoops was her groundbreaking report of sexual harassment allegations made against Clarence Thomas by University of Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill, leading the Senate Judiciary Committee to re-open Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Previously, in 1986, she broke the story that Supreme Court nominee Douglas H. Ginsburg had smoked marijuana, leading Ginsburg to withdraw his name. And in 1977, she reported on secret Supreme Court deliberations relating to the Watergate scandal.\n\nNina Totenberg was born in New York, the eldest daughter of violinist Roman Totenberg, who was born in Poland, and Melanie (Shroder) Totenberg, who was a real estate broker. She is the widow of U.S. Senator Floyd K. Haskell (D-Colorado), whom she married in 1979. She remarried in 2000 to H. David Reines, a trauma surgeon and Vice Chairman of Surgery at Inova Fairfax Hospital. On their honeymoon, he treated her for severe injuries after she was hit by a boat propeller while swimming. In March 2010, Totenberg's sister Amy Totenberg was nominated by President Barack Obama to the U.S. District Court in Atlanta. Amy Totenberg was confirmed the next year. Another sister, Jill Totenberg, is a businesswoman married to Brian Foreman. On August 6, 2015, the Ames Stradivarius, which had been stolen from their father 35 years earlier, was returned to the three sisters.\n\nTotenberg enrolled in Boston University in 1962, majoring in journalism, but dropped out less than three years later because, in her own words, she \"wasn’t doing brilliantly\". Soon after dropping out of college, Totenberg began her journalism career at the \"Boston Record American\", where she worked on the Women's Page and learned breaking news journalism skills by volunteering in the news department. She moved on to the \"Peabody Times\" in Massachusetts and \"Roll Call\" in Washington, D.C.\n\nAt the \"National Observer\", Totenberg began covering legal affairs. In 1971 she broke a story about a secret list of candidates President Richard Nixon was considering for the Supreme Court. All the candidates were later rejected as unqualified by the American Bar Association and none were nominated.\n\nAfter Totenberg wrote an \"Observer\" profile of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, the latter wrote a long letter to the paper's editor demanding she be fired. Instead, the editor printed the letter in the \"Observer\" along with a rebuttal of Hoover's complaints regarding the article.\n\nShe was fired from that paper for plagiarism in 1972 regarding a profile she wrote of then-soon-to-be Speaker Tip O'Neill which included, without attribution, quotes from members of Congress that had previously appeared in \"The Washington Post\". Totenberg has said that the dismissal also related to her rebuffing of sexual overtures from an editor. Many of Totenberg's colleagues have defended her, noting that this was a case of using previously reported quotes, a common journalistic practice in the 1970s. In 1995, Totenberg told the \"Columbia Journalism Review\", \"I have a strong feeling that a young reporter is entitled to one mistake and to have the holy bejeezus scared out of her to never do it again.\"\n\nShe next worked for the New York-based news magazine \"New Times\". At that publication, she wrote a celebrated article called \"The Ten Dumbest Members of Congress\", prompting the senator at the top of the list, William L. Scott, to call a press conference to deny that he was the \"dumbest member of Congress.\"\n\nIn 1975, Nina Totenberg was hired by Bob Zelnick to work at National Public Radio and has been there since.\n\nIn 1977, Totenberg broke a story about the Supreme Court appeal of three men who had been convicted in the Watergate scandal: H.R. Haldeman, John N. Mitchell, and John D. Ehrlichman. Totenberg revealed the results of their secret 5–3 vote against reviewing the case and that the three dissenters were appointees of President Richard Nixon. Nixon had resigned three years earlier, in the wake of Watergate. Totenberg also revealed that Nixon-appointed Chief Justice Warren Burger delayed announcing the results of the vote, hoping to sway his fellow justices. Her reporting of private Supreme Court deliberations was a novel development in Supreme Court reporting and led to speculation about who on the Court gave her the information.\n\nIn 1986, Totenberg broke the story that William H. Rehnquist, who was nominated for Chief Justice of the United States by Ronald Reagan, had written a memo in 1970 opposing the Equal Rights Amendment, in which he said that the amendment would \"hasten the dissolution of the family\" and that would \"virtually abolish all legal distinctions between men and women.\" The memo was written when Rehnquist was head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in the Nixon Administration.\n\nTotenberg broke the story that Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, who had been nominated to the Supreme Court by Ronald Reagan, had smoked marijuana \"on a few occasions\" during his student days in the 1960s and while an assistant professor at Harvard Law School in the 1970s, something that did not appear in Ginsburg's FBI background check. The revelations resulted in Ginsburg's withdrawing his name from consideration. Totenberg was awarded the 1988 Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Silver Baton award for outstanding broadcast journalism for the story.\n\nIn 1991, a few days before a confirmation vote was scheduled for Republican George H. W. Bush's Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, Totenberg disclosed allegations of sexual harassment lodged against Thomas by University of Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill. Totenberg's report about Hill's allegations led the Senate Judiciary Committee to re-open Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation hearings to consider Hill's charges.\n\nTotenberg was criticized by many of Thomas' supporters, including Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee. The Senate appointed special counsel Peter E. Fleming Jr. to investigate the leak. Totenberg and \"Newsday\"'s Timothy Phelps were subpoenaed by Fleming, but refused to answer questions about their confidential sources.\n\nTotenberg was confronted by one Thomas supporter, Republican Senator Alan K. Simpson, during and after the taping of an episode of \"Nightline\". On the show, Simpson criticized Totenberg, saying \"What politicians get tired of is bias in reporters. Let's not pretend your reporting is objective here. That would be absurd.\" After Totenberg defended her reporting and objectivity on the show, Simpson followed her out of the studio and continued to criticize her, even holding open the door of her limousine so she could not leave. \"He was in a complete rage. He was out of control,\" Totenberg said. Accounts differ on Totenberg's response, but she used what she called \"choice epithets\" and said: \"I think I told him to shut the fuck up.\"\n\nFollowing Totenberg's allegation to \"The Washington Post\"'s Howard Kurtz that she had been sexually harassed at the \"National Observer\", Al Hunt of \"The Wall Street Journal\" brought up the plagiarism incident in a column about media coverage of and responses to the Thomas hearings. Some observers connected Hunt's rehashing of a then nearly 20-year-old incident to the stance of the \"Journal\", whose conservative editorial pages had \"editorially championed\" Thomas and had previously criticized Totenberg, but Hunt denied any ideological motivation.\n\nFor the report and NPR's gavel-to-gavel coverage, Totenberg received the George Foster Peabody Award. The same year, she won the George Polk Award for excellence in journalism and the Joan S. Barone Award for excellence in Washington-based national affairs/public policy reporting (the latter also in part for her coverage of the retirement of Justice Thurgood Marshall). The American Library Association presented her with its James Madison Award, given to those who \"championed, protected, and promoted public access to government information and the public’s right to know\". She also earned the Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for investigative reporting.\n\nIn addition to awards mentioned above, and among her other awards, Totenberg has been honored seven times by the American Bar Association for excellence in legal reporting and won the first-ever Toni House award presented by the American Judicature Society for a career body of work, and was the first radio journalist to be honored by the National Press Foundation as Broadcaster of the Year. She has written articles for the \"Harvard Law Review\" (including tributes to Justices William J. Brennan, Jr. and Lewis Powell when they retired); \"The New York Times Magazine\", \"New York\" magazine; the \"Christian Science Monitor\"; and numerous other legal and general circulation publications. She also contributed to the Jewish Women's Archive's online exhibit \"Jewish Women and the Feminist Revolution\" with regard to her reporting on Anita Hill's allegations against Clarence Thomas. In the 1990s Totenberg was a regular contributor to ABC's \"Nightline\".\n\nTotenberg played the part of an election anchor in the film \"The Distinguished Gentleman\" (1992), and also appeared briefly as herself in the Kevin Kline film \"Dave\" (1993). Her image has also been used for an item produced for NPR called \"The Nina Totin' Bag\"——a play on her name and the stereotypical tote bag offered as a thank-you gift for donating to a public broadcasting pledge drive.\n\nTotenberg has made friends with a number of politicians and lawyers in national politics, and her personal connections to these people have occasionally generated discussion. Allegations that Totenberg obtained her scoops by untoward means were prevalent early in her career, a fact Bill Kovach, editor of \"The New York Times\", attributed to sexism since she was one of the few women working in a predominantly male environment. Totenberg was criticized by some commentators for hugging her friend Lani Guinier during a press conference announcing Guinier's nomination by Bill Clinton to the post of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Media critic Howard Kurtz reported that while Totenberg said she did not intend to give special treatment to Guinier in her reporting, she had hugged her because she had not seen her in some time. Then in 2000, some journalists expressed concern that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's officiating at Totenberg's marriage could be seen as a conflict of interest. Totenberg responded she did not consider it a conflict of interest since her friendship with the jurist was established long before Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court. She had made the same observation about her friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" editorialist Paul Gigot wrote in 1991 that Totenberg exhibits partisanship in her reporting. \"Washington Post\" reporter Thomas Edsall said in 1995 that she was cited as an example of liberal bias in public broadcasting due to her reporting on two controversial Supreme Court nominations.\n\nIn 1995, responding to conservative Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who characterized AIDS as a \"disease transmitted by people deliberately engaging in unnatural acts\" in his effort to cut government spending to combat it, Totenberg said: \"I think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the good Lord's mind, because if there's retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion or one of his grandchildren will.\" On the same show, conservative columnists Charles Krauthammer and Tony Snow also criticized Helms, with Krauthammer calling Helms's remarks \"bigoted and cruel\" and Snow accusing him of \"hypocrisy\". Totenberg subsequently expressed regret for her choice of words, saying: \"It was a stupid remark. I'll pay for it for the rest of my life.\" Following his October 2010 firing from NPR for comments he made on FoxNews, Juan Williams said the failure of NPR to discipline her for these statements was an example of NPR's double standard, a charge echoed by Fox News and conservative pundits.\n\n\n"}

In the story there are elements of narrative that are similar to more famous fairy tales such as The Adventures of Pinocchio and Little Red Riding Hood; despite this, the themes present in Otesánek appear nonetheless to be quite different from most other European fairy tales, with a particularly ambiguous moral which leaves a lot of room to subjective interpretation.\n\nThe story begins with a couple that for a long time has been waiting for a child, which however does not seem to arrive. One day the husband finds in the nearby forest a log of wood (Otesánek) that strangely resembles a baby and decides to bring it home. To the joy of the couple, the wooden baby comes to life and asks to be fed. Initially the couple is enthusiastic that their wish of having a child has finally been granted, however the situation soon takes a turn for the worse as they find themselves having to deal with the insatiable appetite of the baby, who will keep growing and eating until he will start eating even people, including his parents. The log anticipates each meal with a nursery rhyme in which he lists every previous meal he has done. The story eventually concludes with the death of Otesánek at the hands of an elderly lady of the village who rips open his chest with a hoe, thus killing the monster and freeing all those who were eaten by him, including his parents.\n\nThe film \"Little Otik\", directed by Jan Švankmajer, was released in 2000 and is greatly inspired by this fairly tale.\n\n"}

Second Minister of Culture Frans Van Mechelen decided to subsidize the construction of the cultural infrastructure. This infrastructure, designed by Alfons Hoppenbrouwers, included a theater, education and residence building. In 1967 the first show of the theater was a fact. Until the 1980s, content was mainly devoted to social-cultural education and experimental programming in the theater. In 1979 the site was expanded with a sports center.\nIn the 1980s an international doll festival was launched and a summer festival for open air theater was launched.

{"id": "2447208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2447208", "title": "Sarah Lancashire", "text": "Sarah Lancashire\n\nSarah-Jane Abigail Lancashire, (born 10 October 1964) is an English actress from Oldham, Lancashire. She graduated from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1986 and began her career in local theatre, whilst teaching drama classes at the University of Salford. Lancashire found popular success in television programmes including \"Coronation Street\" (1991–1996, 2000), \"Where the Heart Is\" (1997–1999), \"Clocking Off\" (2000) and \"Seeing Red\" (2000) and earned widespread recognition. In the summer of 2000, Lancashire signed a two-year golden handcuffs contract with the ITV network which made her the UK's highest paid television actress.\n\nSubsequent television roles include the costume dramas \"Oliver Twist\" (2007), \"Lark Rise to Candleford\" (2008–2011) and \"The Paradise\" (2012), and the fact based dramas \"Cherished\" (2005) and \"Five Daughters\" (2010). Since 2012, Lancashire has earned extensive critical acclaim for her roles in the contemporary drama series \"Last Tango in Halifax\" (2012–2016) and \"Happy Valley\" (2014–present). Lancashire has also appeared in the feature films \"And When Did You Last See Your Father?\" (2007) and \"Dad's Army\" (2016), and West End theatre productions including \"Blood Brothers\" in 1990, \"Guys and Dolls\" from 2005 to 2006 and \"Betty Blue Eyes\" in 2011.\n\nHer combined acting credits have earned Lancashire a number of awards and nominations over a career spanning four decades, including two British Academy Television Award wins out of five nominations. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to drama.\n\nSarah-Jane Abigail Lancashire was born on 10 October 1964 in Oldham, Lancashire.\n\nHer father, Geoffrey Lancashire (1933–2004), was a television scriptwriter noted for his work on the soap opera \"Coronation Street\" and situation comedies such as \"The Cuckoo Waltz\". Her mother, Hilda, worked as Geoffrey's personal assistant. She has three brothers, one her elder, one younger and a twin. Lancashire was educated at Oldham Hulme Grammar School between 1976-81.\n\nAt the age of 17, she started to suffer from clinical depression.\n\nLancashire has stated she was never driven by the ideas of fame and status. Her background had inspired an initial interest in working behind the scenes in television. She did not give serious thought to the performing arts until the age of 18. After winning a place at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, Lancashire realised that she enjoyed acting. She graduated in 1986, describing her time as a student there as \"tremendous\" but \"seriously hard work and quite intimidating\".\n\nAfter rejection from several repertory theatre companies, Lancashire was given her first acting role by Howard Lloyd-Lewis, artistic director of the Manchester Library Theatre Company, which provided her with an Equity Card. Lancashire performed two plays with the company, \"Pacific Overtures\" and \"The Beauty Game\", which she states formed \"the start of my career as an actor\". She found her first professional acting experience \"terrifying\" as a result of the live audiences, recalling that, \"because I wore a bathing costume in some of the scenes, I got heckled!\" She also realised that taking risks or underperforming could have had consequences for her acting career. Her role as Denise in \"The Beauty Game\" earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards.\n\nAt the age of 22, Lancashire married her first serious boyfriend, Gary Hargreaves, a music lecturer 11 years her senior, whom she had met four years earlier.\n\nRecalling the circumstances of her first marriage in 2001, Lancashire stated she only married because she became pregnant and possessed both a traditional outlook and a fear of the stigma of having a child out of wedlock. Thomas, her first child with Hargreaves, was born in 1987; a second son, Matthew, was born in 1989. During her early career, Lancashire found herself with large breaks between theatre appearances. To support herself financially, she worked as a drama teacher for five years at Salford University alongside her acting work.\n\nDiscussing Lancashire's time as a visiting lecturer in Acting and Characterisation, Professor Ron Cook, Head of the University's School of Media, Music and Performance, noted that Lancashire made a \"significant impact\" in the formative stages of the drama department at the University and had also directed student productions.\n\nIn 1987, Lancashire made a brief appearance in \"Coronation Street\" as Wendy Farmer, a prospective lodger of series regular Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey). In the late 1980s, she also appeared in an episode of the children's anthology series \"Dramarama\", and a single episode of the ITV sitcom \"Watching\".\n\nIn 1990, Lancashire received her \"big break\" — the role of Linda in a production of Willy Russell's \"Blood Brothers\" at the Albery Theatre. Although she thoroughly enjoyed performing in London's West End, she found it difficult to reconcile the experience with raising two young children in Manchester.\n\nTwo weeks after finishing her run in \"Blood Brothers\", Lancashire auditioned for the role of new \"Coronation Street\" character Raquel Wolstenhulme, a colleague of supermarket employee Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy).\n\nLancashire joined on a three-month contract, continuing to teach at Salford University for another year. Raquel first appeared on 25 January 1991 and departed on 10 May; having moved to London to try to launch a modelling career. Lancashire had initially been reserved about Raquel's characterisation, noting that her \"acidic side\" could have rendered her the \"street bitch\" had it been embellished. She took care to highlight Raquel's potential, playing against what had been written to make her more comic, evoking audience sympathy. Between 26 September and 19 October 1991, Lancashire played the title role in an adaption of \"Educating Rita\" at the Queen's Theatre, Hornchurch. Following Raquel's reintroduction on 30 December 1991, Lancashire committed herself to \"Coronation Street\" full-time. She would remain in the series until 1996, earning a reported annual salary of £90,000.\n\nTwo years into the role, she experienced a 14-month nervous breakdown but did not confide in anyone besides her close family or take any time off work, which in retrospect she deemed \"the worst thing [she] could have done. During the worst part of her experience Lancashire described herself as \"hysterical at the thought of getting out of bed\". Her mother Hilda forced her to seek medical assistance for her condition, which Lancashire states \"gave me my life back\", her twenties having been \"a write-off\".\n\nLancashire felt her first marriage had also contributed to her unhappiness; in 2001, she stated that though her marriage lasted ten years, it \"was 10 years longer than it should have done\". In 1995 she separated from Hargeaves; the pair would ultimately later divorce. She described leaving her marriage as a \"cleansing experience\" and a \"renaissance\"; one that enabled her to rediscover her sense of identity.\n\nOther steps that Lancashire took to combat her depression included remaining single for five years, attending therapy sessions, and taking prescriptions of the anti-depressant drug Paroxetine.\n\nIn December 1995 Lancashire starred in the spin-off straight-to-video film \"Coronation Street – The Cruise\", a 75-minute special detailing Raquel and Curly's honeymoon. The special was advertised as being exclusive to video, and 750,000 copies were sold, to the value of £10 million. Lancashire departed \"Coronation Street\" in 1996 due to her heavy work schedule and desire to pursue other projects. She had also tired of the fame the role brought her, shying away from personal appearances and interviews with television magazines. Her final scenes attracted 20 million viewers. Lancashire's performance in the role saw her nominated in the Most Popular Actress category at the 2nd National Television Awards in October 1996.\n\nLancashire's next role was district nurse Ruth Goddard in the ITV drama series \"Where the Heart Is\", which began airing in 1997. Also in 1997 she filmed a situation comedy for the BBC, \"Bloomin' Marvellous\", in which she played Liz, one half of an argumentative married couple trying for a baby.\n\nHowever, due to poor viewing figures and a damning critical response the sitcom was not renewed. Regarding the negative reception to the series, her co-star Clive Mantle saracastically remarked \"I've seen murderers and rapists get a better press than we did\". Lancashire continued to star as Ruth Goddard in \"Where the Heart Is\" for its second and third series in 1998 and 1999. In 1998 she was nominated for her second National Television Award for Most Popular Actress. In February 1999 she made a guest appearance in the British dark comedy anthology series \"Murder Most Horrid\" alongside comedian Dawn French. The pair played two yachtswoman whose journey ends with fatal repercussions. In April it was announced that Lancashire would be quitting \"Where the Heart Is\", despite an offered pay rise. At the time, \"Where the Heart is\" was the third most popular drama on British Television, regularly attracting 12 million viewers. Lancashire's decision was reportedly influenced by the series filming away from home, and a fear that remaining in the series long term would harm her career. In January 2000 she expanded on her decision, stating that Ruth \"was too chocolate-boxy, no longer a challenge\".\n\nOn 2 January 2000, Lancashire returned to \"Coronation Street\" for a single episode in which Raquel asks Curly for a divorce. Lancashire felt it was an apt time to return, as she was now a more confident actress and wanted to portray Raquel again before she aged significantly. The series' producer at the time, Jane Macnaught, deemed Raquel one of \"Coronation Street\" most popular ever characters and her return an opportunity for her \"millions of fans\" to learn what had become of her. Lancashire and Kennedy were the sole actors in the episode, the first to feature just two characters. From late January, Lancashire appeared as factory employee Yvonne Kolakowski, a widow with a dysfunctional personal life, in the BBC One drama series \"Clocking Off\". Lancashire used her own experiences as a single mother in her characterisation. In March, she played actress Coral Atkins in the television film \"Seeing Red\".\n\nLancashire found shooting the drama, which detailed Atkins' decision to quit her acting career in order to set up a care home for abused children, \"mentally draining\". Lancashire then spent eight weeks filming the BBC One legal sitcom \"Chambers\" in which she played \"ambitious\" and \"bigoted\" barrister Ruth Quirke. The series was aired from June 2000. Lancashire's final role in 2000 was in the two-part drama thriller \"My Fragile Heart\". Lancashire's output in 2000 earned her several awards. She was voted best actress at the TV Quick Awards in September 2000 for her roles in \"Clocking Off\" and \"Seeing Red\", and in October was voted Most Popular Actress at the 6th National Television Awards for \"Seeing Red\". In March 2001 she was named Drama Performer of the Year by the Television and Radio Industries Club, with mention of her work in \"Clocking Off\" and \"Seeing Red\".\n\nFollowing Lancashire's success in connecting with a television audience, ITV sought to secure her exclusively to their network in a two-year golden handcuffs deal, which was finalised in July 2000. Lancashire became the first actress to be given such a contract with ITV. The deal, worth £1.3 million, made Lancashire the highest-paid actress in British Television. Discussing the exclusive signing ITV controller of drama Nick Elliott identified Lancashire as being someone with \"a great range [who] creates a tremendous empathy with an audience\". He also admitted that heavy interest in Lancashire from the BBC had been a factor in giving her the contract, and blocking her from working with other networks. Her last role on BBC One during this period was comedy drama \"Gentleman's Relish\", an adaptation of the Miles Gibson novel \"Kingdom Swann\". The television film, which aired on New Year's Day 2001, was Lancashire's first in the costume drama genre; she played a housekeeper harbouring romantic feelings for her employer (Billy Connolly).\n\nHer first role under her new contract with ITV was the six-part drama \"The Glass\" opposite John Thaw. The series, which aired between May and June 2001 saw Lancashire star as a saleswoman for a double-glazing company who ends up caught in a love triangle with her boss and his nephew. Retrospectively, the series was judged not to be a success; it averaged 5.8 million viewers, less than rival show on BBC One, \"Messiah\". In August 2001, Lancashire married television executive Peter Salmon, in a low-key ceremony held at Langar Hall, Nottinghamshire. Salmon had proposed to Lancashire in New York during a holiday at Easter time 2001. The two began a romantic relationship in the summer of 2000, though they had first met several years earlier whilst she was portraying Raquel on \"Coronation Street\" and he was employed by Granada Studios, which produces the soap opera. In October Lancashire starred in an adaptation of the Michelle Magorian novel \"Back Home\" as Peggy Dickinson, a woman adjusting to life in post-war Britain after having been separated from her family during the war.\n\nIn March 2002 Lancashire received an Honorary Master of Arts degree from Salford University. In April, She starred in two-part psychological thriller \"The Cry\", which she described as her \"most naked role yet\". She played a social worker grieving her second still-born child who is determined to protect a baby she perceives to be at risk of abuse. Lancashire drew on her own experiences of clinical depression in her depiction of her character's mentality. Her performance saw her awarded with a Golden Nymph award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Mini-Series at the Monte-Carlo Television Festival. In April it was reported that Lancashire had been lined up play the lead role in comedy drama \"Life Begins\", which creator Mike Bullen had written with Lancashire in mind. However, by June, Lancashire had exited the drama, unwilling to commit to a potentially long running series. Later that month BBC News and newspaper \"The Guardian\" reported that Lancashire had exited her exclusive deal with ITV, which would not be renewed after it expired in the autumn. The decision was reportedly influenced by Lancashire's desire to reduce her workload and to have the freedom to take on other roles. In September 2002 she appeared in a two-part crime drama pilot, \"Rose and Maloney\", as legal investigator Rose Linden. On 22 December she appeared in the television movie \"Birthday Girl\" as Rachel Jones, who plans a party to celebrate being in remission from a serious illness, only to discover that the disease has returned.\n\nLancashire's final role under her ITV contract was Gertrude Morel in an adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's 1913 novel \"Sons and Lovers\", airing in January 2003. The portrayal –her first of a mother with adult children– followed Gertrude's transformation from a young bride into a fifty-something woman ravaged by her life experiences of poverty and domestic abuse. Lancashire re-read the novel several times prior to filming, and identified with the themes of filial and marital relationships she had been unable to appreciate as a GCSE student. The miniseries gave her a sense of conviction in her career path, stating ahead of the broadcast in 2002: \"whatever the reason I do what I do, I felt I had come to a point where I could stop searching after this\". Reviewing the serial Paul Hoggart of \"The Times\" wrote that Lancashire \"steals the show\" with a \"performance of immense subtlety and quiet strength, proof, if we still needed it, that she has matured into a terrific actress.\" Conversely Andrew Billen, writing in \"New Statesman\", wrote that \"Sarah Lancashire was no revelation at all\", purely because she had \"long since proved herself a formidable actress\".\n\nWhile pregnant with her third child, Lancashire began an 18-month career break, the longest of her working life. In April 2003, Lancashire gave birth to her third son, Joseph. Lancashire's first job after returning to work was her directorial debut on an episode of the BBC One anthology series \"The Afternoon Play\". For \"Viva Las Blackpool\" she was given the Best Newcomer Award (sponsored by BBC Birmingham) at the Birmingham Screen Festival and the Best New Talent Award at the Royal Television Society (Midlands) awards in 2004. The venture also earned her first British Academy Television Awards nomination in 2005 for Best new Director of Fiction. Lancashire next filmed three two-part stories for \"Rose and Maloney\", following on from the pilot episode in 2002. The delay between shooting for the pilot and its follow-up was a result of Lancashire's career break and problems reconciling her availability with that of co-star Phil Davis.\n\nIn 2005 Lancashire starred in \"The Rotters' Club\" as a housewife in 1970s Birmingham. Also in 2005 she appeared in the BBC television film \"Cherished\" as Angela Cannings, a British woman who was wrongfully convicted of killing her two baby sons. Lancashire was proud to be involved with the project, having greatly admired Cannings strength of character during her ordeal, and being able to relate to her sense of anguish as a parent. In December 2005, Lancashire returned to West End theatre, taking on the role of Miss Adelaide in the Donmar Warehouse production of \"Guys and Dolls\" at the Piccadilly Theatre. Lancashire was due to stay with the production until March 2006, but due to a severe chest infection made her last appearance on 4 January. In 2006 Lancashire accepted an invitation to write a short autobiographical entry in \"Who's Who\". Lancashire's only television acting role in 2006 was as house-wife and cake-maker Elaine in the BBC comedy drama \"Angel Cake\". In November she presented an episode of the Five documentary series \"Disappearing Britain\" in which she interviewed people with memories of Wakes Week holidays in Blackpool during the early 20th century. In February 2007 she made an appearance in the E4 teen drama series \"Skins\". This was followed by a leading role in the BBC Two television drama \"Sex, the City and Me\" as solicitor Ruth Gilbert. In October, Lancashire appeared in her first feature film, David Nicholls' \"And When Did You Last See Your Father?\" in which she played aunt Beaty. In December, she played the supporting role of Mrs Corney in the BBC's 2007 adaption of Charles Dickens' 1838 novel \"Oliver Twist\". Whilst ambivalent about the serial as a whole, \"The Daily Mirror\"s Jane Simon singled Lancashire out for praise stating that she \"really sets the tone for the cold, unfeeling world into which orphaned Oliver is born.\"\n\nBetween 2008 and 2011 Lancashire narrated the BBC One series \"Lark Rise to Candleford\", a costume drama based on Flora Thompson's memoir of her Oxfordshire childhood in the 1880s. In April, she appeared in the opening episode of the 2008 series of \"Doctor Who\", as \"an enigmatic and powerful businesswoman\" who Lancashire described as a \"warped Mary Poppins\". She was amongst a number of high-profile actors the series' executive producer Russell T Davies secured for the fourth series of the science-fiction drama as part of his intention to make it \"bigger and blowsier\". In 2009, Lancashire starred in the BBC One musical drama series \"All the Small Things\". She played Esther Caddick, a full-time mother who starts a choir after her husband leaves her for a more glamorous woman. In July that year the actress was made a honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Huddersfield. Following this, she reunited with director Coky Giedroyc, who had directed her in \"Oliver Twist\", for a 2009 television adaptation of Emily Brontë's 1847 novel \"Wuthering Heights\" in which she played housekeeper Nelly Dean. In 2010 Lancashire portrayed Rosemary Nicholls, mother of a murder victim, in the three-part BBC drama \"Five Daughters\"; a depiction of the Ipswich serial murders from the perspective of the victims and their families. Though the pair never met, Lancashire felt it important to receive Nicholls consent before filming, and was later \"humbled\" and \"relieved\" to receive a feedback letter thanking her for her portrayal. Also in 2010 she guest-starred in the police drama series \"Inspector George Gently\".\nIn March 2011 Lancashire began starring in a new Cameron Mackintosh musical, \"Betty Blue Eyes\", at the Novello Theatre. In the production, a loose adaptation of the 1984 film \"A Private Function\", she starred as Joyce Chilvers, an aspirational housewife who Lancashire describes as \"brittle\" and \"capricious\". Despite positive reviews the musical closed in London on 24 September 2011, after a run of just six months. For her performance Lancashire was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical. In 2012 she appeared as lady's maid Miss Whisset in the penultimate episode of the 2010 revival of \"Upstairs Downstairs\". In September 2012 Lancashire began appearing as Head of Ladieswear Miss Audrey in the six-part series \"The Paradise\" set in a department store in Northern England in the late 19th century. Lancashire described her character as \"a true archetypal spinster\" who has long denied herself a romantic life and who begins to feel undermined by a younger colleague.\n\nBetween November 2012 and December 2016 Lancashire appeared opposite Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi in the BBC drama series \"Last Tango in Halifax\". In the series she plays Caroline, an Oxford-educated headmistress who feels that her mother's second marriage gives her \"permission\" to be herself. Caroline's same-sex relationship with a fellow teacher resulted in Lancashire receiving more fan mail than for any other role, largely from women telling her that the series had helped them to come out. Due to the under-representation of gay characters in television, Lancashire felt it particularly important that Caroline's experience would not be depicted inaccurately. In her portrayal she opted to focus on the \"humanity\" of the character, rather than her sexuality. Filming of the second series clashed with filming of the second series of \"The Paradise\", which necessitated Lancashire leaving \"The Paradise\" partway through its second series. For her role as Caroline she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in both 2013 and 2014, winning in 2014. At the 2015 Hay Festival Lancashire stated that of all the roles she has taken on in her career Caroline is the one she is most proud of, citing the \"extraordinary impact\" of the character. After airing three full series, \"Last Tango in Halifax\" returned for a fourth series in December 2016, consisting of two episodes which were promoted as \"Christmas Specials\".\n\nIn 2014, Lancashire re-united with \"Last Tango in Halifax\" writer Sally Wainwright on the crime drama \"Happy Valley\". Wainwright was keen to write another role for Lancashire after being \"blown away\" by her performances in \"Last Tango in Halifax\". Lancashire portrays single-grandparent Catherine Cawood, a police sergeant still dealing with the aftermath of her daughter's rape, and subsequent suicide, eight years earlier. Mark Lawson of \"The Guardian\" identified the performance as a career best for Lancashire, stating that she perfectly conveyed \"the script's demandingly contradictory notes of tragedy, comedy, love, guilt, weakness and courage\". For this role she earned the TV Choice Award for Best Actress in 2014, and the Royal Television Programme Award for Best Actress in 2015. In September 2014 the \"Radio Times\" listed her as one of the thirty most powerful women in British television and radio. In April 2015 she received her fourth BAFTA television nomination, her first in the Best Actress category. In June 2015 she was named Best Actress in a Drama Series at the Monte Carlo Television Festival.\n\nDespite Lancashire's concerns regarding the decision to extend the story told in \"Happy Valley\", Wainwright's \"genuine\" storytelling and \"integrity\" convinced her to return for a second series, which aired in 2016. Lancashire stated that she found the second series as \"emotionally brutal\" as the first; disclosing to \"The Independent\" that she inhabited Catherine's emotional pain for the entirety of the shoot. Whilst promoting the second series, Lancashire also refuted criticism about the level of violence towards women in the series, stating she \"would never condone anything which [she] thought was salacious, titillating, or gratuitous\" and that Catherine's experience represented an \"absolutely honest portrayal of what a female police officer can be subjected to\". For her role in the second series of \"Happy Valley\", Lancashire won the 2017 National Television Award for Best Dramatic Performance, and the BAFTA TV award for Best Actress.\n\nIn March 2015 Lancashire began filming a television adaptation of Ronald Harwoods 1980 play \"The Dresser\". In the teleplay, which aired in October 2015, Lancashire portrayed stage manager Madge, whose unrequited love for 'Sir' (Anthony Hopkins), the head of a repertory theatre company, pits her at odds with his dresser and confidant, Norman (Ian McKellen).

Organised by the National Arts Council, it is one of the most significant events in the regional arts scene. The festival, usually held in mid-year for a stretch of one month, incorporates theatre arts, dance, music and visual arts, among other possibilities. Besides local participants, approximately 70% of the events are put up by international artists.\n\nToday, the Singapore Arts Festival is no longer managed by the National Arts Council. It has a new name and new direction under Singapore International Festival of Arts (SIFA), organised by Arts House Limited and commissioned by National Arts Council. In 2014 - 2017, the Festival Director for Singapore International Festival of Arts is Ong Keng Sen. He designed a two-part festival with a pre-festival of ideas The O.P.E.N. (Open, Participate, Engage, Negotiate). The O.P.E.N. runs from June - July and thereafter followed by the main festival SIFA in August and September. Details on the new Singapore International Festival of Arts can be found at www.sifa.sg.\n\nThe Singapore Arts Festival started in 1977 as a national arts festival to celebrate local arts from the diverse communities in Singapore. Over the last three decades, the Festival has played a symbiotic and catalytic role in the development of the artistic and cultural life of Singapore. It has helped to transform the city’s cultural landscape, turning it into one of Asia’s major cultural capitals today. It has influenced local artists as well as increasing public awareness and demand for the arts, spawning new cultural platforms, events, and movements that help underpin the lively cultural scene in present Singapore. It was formed in 1999 when the existing Festival of Asian Performing Arts and the Festival of Arts were merged as an annual event.\n\nIn addition to international acts, Singaporean productions (some in collaboration with overseas partners) in previous Arts Festivals include ECNAD's Missing In Tall Pillars (2002), Mark Chan's Little Toys (2003), Opiume (2004) and Dreaming of Kuanyin Meeting Madonna (2007).\n\nThe Singapore Arts Festival focused on water in 2008, with both the opening and closing shows being performed on water.\n\nThe opening show of 2008, Water Fools, was performed by the French group Ilotopie. It was held from 23–25 May at Boat Quay. The entire performance was performed in the Singapore River.\nThe closing show, Hydro Sapiens, was performed by The Lunatics from the Netherlands. It was held in Bedok Reservoir from 20–22 June.\n\nThe 2010s theme, Between You and Me, was all about getting closer to the arts. For the first time, the Festival will actively reach out to everyone through an outreach programme called com.mune. Together with a stellar showcase of international performances, the Festival will truly touch you in ways you never imagined possible.\n\nSingapore Arts Festival 2011 will be held from 13 May to 5 June 2011 and its theme is 'I Want To Remember'. The opening show will be When a Gray Taiwanese Cow Stretched, by Ishinha. About the migration of people from the South Sea islands to South East Asia, Taiwan and Japan, it will be Singapore Arts Festival’s largest-ever outdoor performance at the Esplanade Park.\n\n\nYourSingapore.com - Singapore Arts Festival\n\n"}

{"id": "19030472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19030472", "title": "Standoff distance", "text": "Standoff distance\n\nStandoff distance is a security term that refers to measures to prevent unscreened and potentially threatening people and vehicles from approaching within a certain distance of a building, car, or other shelter, roadblock or other location, or to a person such as a law enforcement officer or VIP, or to a friendly area / location. \"See Power projection, Identification friend or foe, Display behavior\"\n\nStandoff distance may be ensured using fixed physical barriers such as fences or bollards; temporary placement of items to block access (e.g., using law enforcement vehicles or police tape to block a road or bridge); physical features other than barriers (these may appear innocuous, such as the White House lawn or adding an ornamental pond); armed guards or positions (e.g., a police sniper in overwatch); or deploying police officers with carbines such as an M-4, instead of just a service sidearm. When police officers have carbines the standoff distance is increased because an attacker who poses a threat can be fired upon from greater distances.\n\nStandoff distance is used when a violent criminal is in a fortified position, when hostages are under armed threat from kidnappers, when a bomb is believed to have been placed, or when other unspecified dangers may be lurking. It is a measure of distance used by government, law enforcement, or military operatives handling the situation to protect their own agents and civilians from physical injury or death while the situation is resolved.\n\nWhen an armed and violent criminal is sheltered in a location not easily reachable by a tranquilizer round or disabling shot - or extreme prejudice ammunition, if authorized by mission leaders - police, military, and counterterrorism officers maintain distance (often out of the direct line of sight and behind cover) while often using a megaphone to call for backup, the arrest of the subject, or to take him/her into custody. Sniper coverage is used often in these situations, and standard procedure for officers or operatives (or citizens taking part in a citizen's arrest) is to call for heavily armored backup while maintaining cover themselves. In the wake of active shooter scenarios, some law enforcement agencies have switched to moving in on the suspects, to prevent the gunmen from harming civilians. Therapeutic interventions or diplomatic techniques may be used to talk down the suspects or identified threats and assailants.\n\nIn a hostage situation, the primary goal is the safe recovery of the hostages, who are usually held under threat of violence or other prolonged physical harm (starvation, poisoning, bleeding, illness) from kidnappers. Thus the situation is treated similarly to situations with other armed attackers under cover, but with even more caution. snipers are often employed to attempt to provide leverage against the hostage-takers or to fire at the hostage takers if an imminent risk of harm to the hostages is identified. \n\nUnless all kidnappers can be hit and killed by sniper gunfire almost simultaneously, generally extreme prejudice (e.g., shooting at gunmen)is not used as freely due to the danger of other kidnappers killing the hostages, as in the 1972 Munich example. \n\nThis is not true in lone wolf situations, where the hostage taker is often shot by a snipers with armor-piercing or wall-piercing ammunition if talk or negotiation resolution is impossible. In all situations the preferred method is to talk the kidnappers into releasing the hostages for ransom or otherwise talking them down using therapeutic or diplomatic techniques, to protect the safety of the hostages and, ideally, have the suspect surrender peacefully.\n\nWith bomb threats, the standoff distance used by law enforcement officers depends on the size and type of the bomb. \nThe smallest standoff distances, about 70 feet from the threat, are used for small pipe bombs with about five pounds of explosives. A human suicide bomber with about 20 pounds of explosives strapped to his/her body has a standoff distance of 110 feet. A briefcase or suitcase bomb with about 50 pounds of explosives has a 150 foot standoff distance. Larger car bombs or truck bombs have a much larger standoff distance, as the blast radius is bigger. A car bomb with a 500 pound bomb has a 320 foot standoff distance. A small delivery truck-based truck bomb with a 1,000 pound bomb has a 640 foot standoff distance. A huge 18-wheeler truck-sized truck bomb with over 60,000 pounds of explosives has a 1,570 foot standoff distance.\n\nStandoff distance is also intended to deter terrorists from using car bombs by making it more difficult for them to cause catastrophic damage. In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, many high-risk federal buildings began enforcing standoff distances. It is based on the concept that a blast shock load is essentially a high-pressure front that moves out radially and decays very quickly - because blast falloff is thus often more exponential than linear (indeed radial - any given explosive must cover a circular-shaped area but blast power generally only increases linearly with explosive strength), any standoff distance helps increases survival chances for passersby and minimizes danger, though shrapnel mitigates this effect if present. \n\nHydraulic roadblocks (sometimes wedge-shaped), or bollards can be raised to block approaching vehicles; these can be designed to prevent even a heavy, fast-moving truck from getting through. Jersey barriers and concrete planters filled with dirt have also been used to maintain separation between screened and unscreened traffic. Certain infrastructure at risk of terrorist attack, such as bridges, may not be well-suited to standoff distances since their purpose is for traffic to travel along them.\n\n"}
{"id": "11425084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11425084", "title": "Stitch 'n Bitch", "text": "Stitch 'n Bitch\n\nStitch 'n Bitch is a name that has been used to refer to social knitting groups since at least World War II. Before the slang term “Stitch ‘n Bitch” was used, groups of women in the 1940s would join to knit and talk in organized Stitch and Bitch clubs. The term was further used in the 1980s as part of the book \"Social History of American Knitting\" by Anne Macdonald. It is partly due to the book's success that the modern day Stitch n' Bitch knitting groups have emerged in cities around the world. The groups, mainly women, meet to knit, stitch and talk. Typically, attendees knit, though others crochet (they are called 'Happy Hookers'), and still others engage in cross-stitching, embroidery, and other needlecraft. Nowadays, the groups have been analyzed by scholars as expressions of resistance to major political, social and technological change in Western societies. However, political discussion is not unusual at these events, and at least some participants are proponents of progressive, liberal, and/or leftist social and political change. Furthermore, the term Stitch ‘n' Bitch is now used by women from across the globe to connect with others in the virtual space seeing as the term has re-emerged in a world where the public sphere is the cyberspace.\n\nWith over 1460 registered Stitch ‘n Bitch groups in 289 cities worldwide, the social knitting movement has demarked itself as a popular social gathering for avid knitters.\n\n\"Stitch 'n Bitch\" is a name used by knitting groups that meet on a weekly or monthly basis at locations throughout the world. This use of the term originates as early as the Second World War. In 1999, Debbie Stoller started a Stitch 'n Bitch group in NYC's East Village, which was open to anyone who wanted to come to knit along or learn to knit. In 2000, she wrote about her groups in \"BUST\" magazine, of which she is the editor-in-chief. Brenda Janish read the article and started the Chicago Stitch 'n Bitch group. That article inspired Vickie Howell to start the Los Angeles Stitch 'n Bitch group and later the Austin Stitch 'n Bitch group. Like Stoller's original group, today's Stitch 'n Bitch clubs are generally casual groups of knitters who meet in public spaces such as bars or cafes for socializing and sharing knitting advice. These groups are free or small fee required memberships and open to the public, and are listed in a directory of worldwide knitting groups that was started by Janish and today is maintained by Stoller: Official Home of Stitch 'n Bitch. As of 2010, the site lists over 700 such groups.\n\nA book series by Debbie Stoller, includes \"Stitch 'n Bitch\" : The Knitter's Handbook\", \"Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker,\" and other titles. From 2005 to 2008, Stitch 'n Bitch was the focus of a trademark dispute. In June 2005, the company Sew Fast Sew Easy filed a trademark application for \"Stitch & Bitch\" to designate a line of knitting and sewing supplies. As of 2007 this application was suspended. In fall 2005, due to letters claiming trademark infringement from Sew Fast/Sew Easy's lawyers, knitting groups that had accounts with CafePress were forced to remove all items featuring the phrase \"Stitch 'n Bitch\". Local groups that communicated with each other through Yahoo! Groups were similarly forced to remove \"Stitch 'n Bitch\" from the name and description of their group. Some groups were deleted, but most groups were able to change their name on Yahoo! to SNB. In 2008, Sew Fast Sew Easy and Debbie Stoller reached a settlement in which Debbie Stoller retained the use of the mark in knitting while Sew Fast Sew Easy retains the use for sewing. Since then all four of Stoller's trademarks have now been registered. The Sew Fast Sew Easy store closed in 2012.\n\nIn recent years, the Stitch ‘n Bitch movement has been considered as a means of reclaiming women’s domestic work in feminist circles. Not only have groups officially been formed through website use, but groups of women on university campuses have also followed the trends in order to resist the taboo representation of the traditional woman.\n\nDr. Beth Ann Pentney, writing in Thirdspace journal, credited Stoller's publications with the rise of feminist knitting. Stoller introduced this approach to feminism to merge political involvement with a women’s community-building activity set in a Do-It-Yourself culture. As a response to Stoller, much scrutiny on the effectiveness of the reclamation of domestic arts as a political feminist act has been done. Some say that the reason of the reintroduction of knitting in modern social gatherings is mainly due to the increase in the search for individualism and the anti-consumerism attitude of our generation. With this said, it is important to denote the implication of technologies in the emergence of a “fabriculture” based on the reclamation of domestic arts and crafts. With the internet accessibility of online information and tips and tricks for knitters and crocheters, the traditionally personal practice of knitting can now be shared easily among strangers, and is open to public discussion and new ideas. These webs of knitters worldwide find affinities via a very modern technology opposing the traditional DIY nature of knitting.\n\n\n"}

It is located in the centre of the city on the Via della Pergola, from which the theatre takes its name. It was built in 1656 under the patronage of Cardinal Gian Carlo de' Medici to designs by the architect Ferdinando Tacca, son of the sculptor Pietro Tacca; its inaugural production was the opera buffa, \"Il potestà di Colognole\" by Jacopo Melani. The opera house, the first to be built with superposed tiers of boxes rather than raked semi-circular seating in the Roman fashion, is considered to be the oldest in Italy, having occupied the same site for more than 350 years.\n\nIt has two auditoria, the Sala Grande, with 1,500 seats, and the Saloncino, a former ballroom located upstairs which has been used as a recital hall since 1804 and which seats 400. \nWork on completing the interior was finished in 1661, in time for the celebration of the wedding of the future grand duke Cosimo III de' Medici, with the court spectacle \"Ercole in Tebe\" by Giovanni Antonio Boretti. Primarily a court theatre used by the Grand Dukes of Tuscany, it was only after 1718 that it was opened to the public. In this theatre the great operas of Mozart were heard for the first time in Italy, and Donizetti’s \"Parisina\" and \"Rosmonda d'Inghilterra,\" Verdi’s \"Macbeth\" (1847) and Mascagni’s \"I Rantzau\" were given their premiere productions.\n\nBy the nineteenth century, La Pergola was performing operas of the best-known composers of the day including Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti and Giuseppe Verdi. Verdi's \"Macbeth\" was given its premiere performance at the Pergola in 1847.\n\nThe Pergola's present appearance dates from an 1855-57 remodelling; it has the traditional horseshoe-shaped auditorium with three rings of boxes and topped with a gallery. It seats 1,000. It was declared a national monument in 1925 and has been restored at least twice since.\n\nToday the theatre presents a broad range of about 250 drama performances each year, ranging from Molière to Neil Simon. Opera is only presented there during the annual \"Maggio Musicale Fiorentino\".\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

They are resting by the roadside after a rainstorm, before travelling to the town of Winchelsea, visible in the background.\n\nThe painting has been interpreted as an allegory of the senses, contrasting the experiences of the blind and sighted sisters. The former feels the warmth of the sun on her face, and fondles a blade of grass, while the latter shields her eyes from the sun or rain and looks at the unusual spectacle of a double rainbow that has just appeared. Some critics have interpreted the rainbow in Biblical terms, as the sign of God's covenant described in Genesis 9:16.\n\nWhen the painting was first exhibited in 1856 it was pointed out to Millais that in double rainbows the inner rainbow inverts the order of the colours. Millais had originally painted the colours in the same order in both rainbows.

It shows French Emperor Napoleon I in uniform in his study at the Tuileries Palace. Despite the detail, it is unlikely that Napoleon posed for the portrait.\n\nIt was a private commission from the Scottish nobleman and admirer of Napoleon, Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton in 1811 and completed in 1812. Originally shown at Hamilton Palace, it was sold to Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery in 1882, from whom it was bought by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in 1954, which deposited it in Washington D.C.'s National Gallery of Art, where it now hangs.\n\nVertical in format, it shows Napoleon standing, three-quarters life size, wearing the uniform of a colonel of the Imperial Guard Foot Grenadiers (blue with white facings and red cuffs). He also wears his Légion d'honneur and Order of the Iron Crown decorations, along with gold epaulettes, white French-style culottes and white stockings. His face is turned towards the viewer and his right hand is in his jacket.\n\nPiled on the desk are a pen, several books, dossiers and rolled papers. More rolled papers and a map are on the green carpet to the left of the desk - on these papers is the painter's signature \"LVD DAVID OPVS 1812\". All this, along with Napoleon's unbuttoned cuffs, wrinkled stockings, disheveled hair, the flickering candles and the time on the clock (4.13am) are all meant to imply he has been up all night, writing laws such as the \"Code Napoléon\" - the word \"Code\" is prominent on the rolled papers on the desk. This maintains his new civil rather than heroic (as in Canova's \"Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker\") or military (as in David's own \"Napoleon Crossing the Alps\") image, though the sword on the chair's armrest still refers back to his military successes. The fleurs-de-lys and heraldic bees also imply the stability of the imperial dynasty.\n\nA second version painted by David, showing exactly the same scene but with Napoleon in his more everyday green mounted chasseurs uniform, was formerly in Prince Napoleon's collection and has since 1979 been in that of the Château de Versailles.\n\nAn analysis of the original painting reveals that the artist reedited the composition and details several times to balance the image, add allusions, and capture a complete story.\n\nBrush strokes and texture indicate that an earlier version had\nNapoleon's upper body flanked by two fluted columns about the width\nof the figure's torso. These strong vertical elements would have created a\ndistraction from the central figure.\n\nThese columns were revised to a carved panel in shadow (on the viewer's\nleft) and a clock with a large face (viewer's right) on level with and\nsomewhat larger than the figure's face. The clock was later repainted\nwith a smaller face moved up and to the right, with the clock body still\ncovering the underlying column brush strokes.\n\nThese revisions greatly improved the compositional balance of the\npainting's upper section, reducing the impression of three vertical\ncolumns. They successfully moved the viewer's focus to Napoleon's face and\nexpression and away from the presumably accurate stature and\nmiddle-heavy build.\n\nThe change also allowed incorporating additional symbology, most notably\nthe time (4:13).\n\nOther revisions were added symbols on the table items and lower section,\nmany painted over fleurs-de-lis which are conspicuously rare in the final image.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15934453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15934453", "title": "The Men Who Stare at Goats", "text": "The Men Who Stare at Goats\n\nThe Men Who Stare at Goats (2004) is a non-fiction work by Jon Ronson concerning the U.S. Army's exploration of New Age concepts and the potential military applications of the paranormal. The title refers to attempts to kill goats by staring at them and stopping their hearts. The book is companion to a three-part TV series broadcast in Britain on Channel 4—\"Crazy Rulers of the World\" (2004)—the first episode of which is also entitled \"The Men Who Stare at Goats\". The same title was used a third time for a loose feature film adaptation in 2009.\n\nThe book's first five chapters examine the efforts of a handful of U.S. Army officers in the late 1970s and early 1980s to exploit paranormal phenomena, New Age philosophy, and elements of the human potential movement to enhance U.S. military intelligence-gathering capabilities as well as overall operational effectiveness. These include the \"First Earth Battalion Operations Manual\" (1979) and a \"psychic spy unit\" established by Army Intelligence at Fort Meade, Maryland, in the late 1970s. (This was the Stargate Project, which the book never mentions by name.) Ronson is put on the historical trail of the \"men who stare at goats\"—Special Forces soldiers who supposedly experimented with psychic powers against de-bleated goats at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, at the now-decommissioned \"Goat Lab\" medical training facility. He examines, and dispenses with, several candidates for the legendary \"master sergeant\" (Chapter 2) who was reported to have killed a goat simply by staring at it, in the earliest days of the program. A martial arts instructor named Guy Savelli claims to be the one.\n\nIn the middle third of the book (Chapters 6-11), the author leaps to the present day—i.e., 2004, just after the Abu Ghraib abuse revelations—and attempts to make connections between the earlier (now terminated, and mostly discredited) military programs and the abuses resulting from the post-9/11 War on Terror (Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, psyops in Iraq, etc.). This includes the use of the children's song \"Barney & Friends\" on Iraqi prisoners-of-war. A purported linking element is the alleged use of music and subliminal messaging at the 1993 Waco siege and other FBI operations. Another is the private business \"franchises\" and consultancies that retired members of the \"psychic unit\" later pursued as civilians. A connection is also proposed between these \"privatized\" psychics and the mass-suicide of members of the Heaven's Gate cult in 1997.\n\nThe final section of the book (Chapters 13-16) leaps backward to the 1950s and attempts to connect the Army psychic program, and later interrogation techniques, with the CIA's MK-ULTRA \"mind control\" research program and the notorious death of Army researcher Frank Olson in 1953. Ronson spends time with Olson's son Eric as he attempts to uncover the mystery of his father's death. The reason his father was terminated, as we discover, was not simply because he knew too much but, rather, that he was having a crisis of conscience and seriously entertaining the notion of going public with all that he knew. The narrative ends with the suggestion that the \"psychic warriors\" are now back in business working for the U.S. military again, possibly in support of assassinations.\n\n\n\nRonson's book was met with mostly positive, often glowing, reviews: the \"Boston Globe\" opined that it is \"a hilarious and unsettling book... Ronson comes off as an unusual cross between Comedy Central's Jon Stewart and \"The New Yorker\"s Seymour Hersh.\" \"The New York Times\" Janet Maslin stated that \"Ronson sets up his book perfectly. It moves with wry, precise agility from crackpot to crackpot in its search for the essence of this early New Age creativity...\".\n\nSome critics, however, were skeptical of what they considered Ronson's shaky logic and some of his bolder assertions. Alex Heard's review in \"U-T San Diego\" was subtitled \"\"Goats\" tries hard to link psychic-spy projects from the past to today's events, and mostly fails\". In many instances, he wrote, \"...there isn't a link. Instead there's a progression of occurrences that don't connect in a meaningful way. The result is a strange new blend: Conspiracy theory meets Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon... You're left feeling like you've been told a shaggy-goat story.\"\n\nThe 2004 series \"Crazy Rulers of the World\" was aired in three parts:\n\n\nIt was broadcast in Britain on Channel 4.\n\nA fictionalized feature film version of the book was released in 2009 under the same name. Grant Heslov directed from a script by Peter Straughan. It is set in Iraq, but was filmed in Comerío Street, Bayamón, Puerto Rico and at the New Mexico Military Institute. The story centers on \"Bob Wilton\" (Ewan McGregor)—the Ronson stand-in—a desperate reporter who stumbles upon the story of a lifetime. He meets \"Lyn Cassady\" (George Clooney)—a composite character—who claims to be a former secret U.S. military psychic soldier re-activated post-9/11. Jeff Bridges plays \"Bill Django\"—clearly a version of Jim Channon—the founder of the psychic soldier program and Lyn's mentor. Kevin Spacey plays \"Larry Hooper\"—a wholly fictional character—who is a former psychic soldier now running a rogue PsyOps unit in Iraq. The film is prefaced with a title card stating \"More of this is true than you would believe\". The DVD release of \"The Men Who Stare at Goats\" includes a bonus documentary featuring Ronson and many of the people who feature prominently in his book.\n\nCoinciding with the release of the feature film in 2009, John Sergeant, the producer of the TV series \"Crazy Rulers of the World\", accused Ronson of \"airbrushing him out of the story\".

However, the unexpected and sudden passing of his father, who was a founder of the Hanol religion (the religious re-establishment of the Korean national founding principle based on the philosophy of spiritual transcendence), eventually led him to return to art expressing ‘spiritual transcendence’ based on his own experience.\n\nHis father was the founder of the Hanol religion - the re-establishment of the Korean traditional religion which foresaw the possibility of evolution in human consciousness from 'Ego-state' to 'Awakened-state' 5000 years ago.\n\nAccording to the Introduction to Trans-Art, “as the son of an unconventional religious leader, he had to experience unbearable religious upheaval as well as personal sacrifice of freedom from very early on in his childhood.“\n\nSewon became obsessive in painting, which was his only means to extricate himself from the mental suffering caused by his given reality of religious prejudice and discrimination. His compulsively acquired painting skill helped him to win a National art competition with a reward to study abroad (Georgetown Preparatory School, the United States).\n\nSewon held two solo exhibitions in high school as a young talented artist. He was well-known in his youth as a prodigious painter, until his failure to perform a new concept of installation art (Super-Individualism Art) discouraged him in such a way that he eventually gave up his art. \nInstead of pursuing art, he majored in Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford University (B.A. and M.A. in PPE).\n\nHowever, after the sudden passing of his father, he was forced to make painful personal sacrifices again. He had to take on insurmountable financial liability and the responsibility of restructuring his father's legacy, which eventually led him to return to art, expressing the sacred teachings on spiritual transcendence, not only based on his father's teachings, but from his own self-confirmation of the spiritual awakening experience.\n\nTrans-Art can also be regarded as the (Non-religious) elaboration of the 'Art of Enlightenment and Awakening' which he introduced as leader of the HANOL spiritual foundation. His art became a driving force behind the structural evolution of the Hanol-religion.\n\nDangun, the Founding Father of Korea, initiated the 'Principles of Hanol Spirit' (the teachings on enlightenment and awakening) introducing the possibility of spiritual transcendence to its people - the evolution of human consciousness from the Ego-state to the Transcendental-state.\n\nAfter 5000 years, the Hanol principles were consolidated into a religious foundation by Shin Jeong Yil, the founder of the Hanol religion.\n\nHowever, after the sudden passing of the founder in 1999, the legal descendent Sewon Shin inevitably took on the responsibility of leadership in an emergency, immediately after graduating from Oxford.\n\nDuring his leadership, he expressed the essence of the transcendental philosophy of the 'Hanol Principle' in the 'Spiritual art of Enlightenment and Awakening' based on his own experience.\n\nHe attempted to transform the existing belief system by integrating ‘Art and Spirituality’. Sewon introduced the concept of 'Spiritual Audience' instead of the traditional notion of religious followers.\n\nAfter he successfully reformed the HANOL foundation, Sewon resigned from the leadership in order to introduce Trans-Art.\n\nTrans-Art can be considered the re-establishment of the 'Art of Enlightenment and Awakening' in a pure art form (Non-religious form), and the elaboration of \"Super-Individualism art (i.e. Trans-ego art)” which he introduced at the Tokyo exhibition. This is based on the self-confirmation of the sacred teachings on ‘Spiritual Transcendence’ that he acquired.\n\nThe artist shows the dynamic process of the transformation in the creation of art with multi-dimensional perspectives that he acquired from his spiritual experience. Sewon attempts to “express the ‘enlightenment and awakening’ which is beyond ‘Form’, by using the ‘multi-dimensional method of expression’ based on the transformational perspective that he acquired from his own experience of enlightenment and awakening.”\n\nIn the 'Optical Awakening series', he is expressing the process of ‘Ego dis-identification’ that he acquired from the suicidal experience which caused the separation of the ‘Ego-mind (artificial mental-algorithm of involuntarily constructed mind-structure)’ and ‘Consciousness (True-Nature)’, initiating the gradual awakening in his consciousness.\n\nFrom the enlightening experiences, he came to realize that art and spirituality share one and the same nature of showing the doorway into another dimension of consciousness where our true essence beyond ‘form’ is indwelling. He is expressing a glimpse of ‘enlightenment and awakening’ which is ‘beyond form’ by using the ‘form of Trans-art’.\n\nAccording to the guidance to Trans-Art, Trans Art Part 1, the multi-dimensional expression of \"Enlightenment and Awakening\", can be regarded as an indirect experience of 'Spiritual Transcendence' and a 'Glimpse of Enlightenment' in the form of art – “the ‘Preview of the Ego dis-identification’ which entails the separation of Mind (Ego) & Consciousness (True Nature).”\n\nIn his major work, the Trans-art part 1 ‘Optical Awakening series’, the Trans-artist shows the consecutive phases of the ‘Enlightenment and Awakening’ process which consists of: 'Awakening Dimensions', ‘Initiation of awakening’, ‘Awakening True-nature’, ‘Flash of Enlightening’, ‘Trans-perceiving Ego’, ‘Dark-side of Ego’, ‘Trans-Quantum physics of mind’, ‘Trans-perceiving mental synapse’, ‘Self-Liberation’, ‘Breaking Free’, ‘Quest for Immortality’, and ‘Trans-Perception’.\n\nTrans-Art can be considered as the re-establishment of the 'Art of Enlightenment and Awakening: the quintessence of Transcendental philosophy' in the form of fine art, and the elaboration of \"Super-Individualism art (i.e. Trans-ego art)” which he introduced at the Tokyo exhibition.\n\nThe \"Hanol Spiritual and Cultural Movement of Art\" is a new way of experiencing religion without religious obligation or religious participation by integrating Art and Spirituality. \n\nAccording to official guidance, Hanol-gyo is an unconventional religion as it encourages other religions and respects their way of pursuing Truth. This is due to its founding principle that regards ‘all proper religion as having the same root and the same destination, the Truth.’\n\nIn commemoration of the 50th anniversary, Hanol-gyo officially agreed upon reformation at the general assembly, and endorsed the \"Hanol Spiritual & Cultural Movement of Art\" for non-believers and the believers of other religions to experience the \"Hanol Principles\" without any religious obligation.\n\nAt the official request of Hanol-gyo, the artist provided his artworks [Optical Awakening], for the \"Hanol Spiritual & Cultural Movement of Art\".\n\n\"Optical Awakening\" is a direct expression of enlightenment and a catalyst for awakening in Art form, in which people can experience the quintessence of Hanol religion and its philosophy simply by appreciating the artworks, rather than participating in a conventional form of religious activity or becoming a spiritual seeker.\n\nBy using Tran-Art [Optical Awakening], as teaching material and as a learning device of Hanol Spiritual Art, the number of non-religious participants in Hanol-gyo has grown significantly. It presented a new possibility for the development of religious culture and structural evolution of religion by expanding the religious boundaries to include a wider perspective.\n\nHis art provided the basis for the 1st and the 2nd reformation of Hanol-gyo.\n\n\"The Gates\", which have been introduced as the signature artwork of \"Optical Awakening\" Trans-Art, is a sculpture depicting the ‘\"Gates of Heaven(Nirvana)\"’ inspired by \"la Porte de I'Enfer\" - \"The Gates of Hell\", the unfinished masterpiece sculpture by Auguste Rodin.\n\nAccording to the official introduction, “the artist projected what he had realized during the days of miserable agony after the sudden passing of his father. He was forced to be responsible for insurmountable amount of liability which he believed the only way out of his misery was to commit suicide. However, the painful experience helped the artist to realize the simple but profound truth which he depicted in his artwork, \"The Gates\".\n\nThe artist shows that the suchness of life and your perceived reality is a mirror that reflects you. “It is when you voluntarily accept the unacceptable aspects of life, instead of resenting or giving up in the face of unacceptable reality, that what you perceived to be \"the Gates to hell\" will show its true face and turn into \"the Gates\" through which you can discover your true nature that cannot be distorted by whatever happens in your life. By giving up what makes up your ego and leaving it behind the gates, you will be left with the immutable essence that cannot be altered by form and phenomena. That immutability is your True Nature that will shine even if you let go of your dark ego.” – interview with Korean Economy\n\n\"The Gates\" face Hell on one side and Heaven on the other. It was made so that a rusty mirror, which has become damaged and discolored, reflects the viewers on the side toward Hell, and a clean and clear mirror reflects the viewers on the side toward Heaven. It has been explained that it is up to the viewers to decide on which side they want to stand to see the reflections of themselves and the world, and that this privilege to choose your own state is a true gift or blessing from God. The artist denotes that it is also the essence of free will that cannot be taken away by anyone.\n\nThe artist indicates that Heaven and Hell may not refer to a certain location or place, but actually one’s inner state of consciousness. The question of what to have reflected on the gates and which side of \"the gates\" to open depends on the individual’s own volition and their present state of consciousness.\n\nAfter the artist realized that Taste, as well as Vision, can be an effective means to show us a way into another dimension of consciousness where our true nature is indwelling, he attempted to integrate Art with Taste in order to express a glimpse of awakening by providing an extraordinary tasting experience only once for each participant. The artist provides a 'once in a lifetime tasting exhibition' for an audience to experience the moment of speechless and mindless state of consciousness - a glimpse of your True Nature, the beauty itself.\n\nIn Tasting Art ‘The Cho : Just Once’, he transforms ‘The Cho (a specially blended liquid substance based on a Korean authentic craft vinegar)’ into an art device to express a taste of Satori (the moment of speechless and mindless state of consciousness.) in the mind of audience.\n\nIn his first tasting art exhibition, he introduced opus 1 \"‘Tasting Blossom’\", opus 2 \"‘Korean Suicide Stopper’\" and opus 3 \"’Pyong Yang Naeng Myeon’\". \n\n\n"}

Beginning in 1868, with financial assistance from a local landowner, he was able to attend the art academy in Prague. He made a trip to the Netherlands, where he studied the Old Masters, then settled in Paris (despite not being able to speak French), where a letter of recommendation assured him the support of Jaroslav Čermák. In 1879 he married Hermina Sedelmeyer, daughter of the wealthy Parisian art dealer Charles Sedelmeyer. For most of his life, he divided his time between Paris and Prague, where he became a Professor at the Art Academy in 1893.\n\nHe was named a member of the Institut de France, partly through the influence of his father-in-law, who also suggested that he do a painting on the theme \"Tu Felix Austria Nube\" (from an old saying: \"Let others wage war: thou, happy Austria, marry\"). The result pleased Emperor Franz Joseph I, who was involved in an unhappy marriage. As a result, Brožík was elevated to the nobility.\n\nHe also became a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, received the Grand Cross of the Légion d'Honneur and was appointed to the Czech Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1884, one of his paintings appeared on a United States postage stamp.\n\nHis health began to decline in 1894, but he threw himself into painting even more diligently. He died suddenly of heart failure in 1901 and was buried in Montmartre. Appreciation of his work suffered a serious decline after his death, as it was considered old-fashioned, but a major retrospective in 2003 has created some renewed interest.\n\n\n"}
