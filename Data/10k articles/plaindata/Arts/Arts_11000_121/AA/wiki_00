{"id": "11586417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11586417", "title": "Aestheticization of violence", "text": "Aestheticization of violence\n\nThe aestheticization of violence in high culture art or mass media has been the subject of considerable controversy and debate for centuries. In Western art, graphic depictions of the Passion of Christ have long been portrayed, as have a wide range of depictions of warfare by later painters and graphic artists. Theater and, in modern times, cinema have often featured battles and violent crimes, while images and descriptions of violence have always been a part of literature. Margaret Bruder states that the aestheticization of violence in film is the depiction of violence in a \"stylistically excessive\", \"significant and sustained way\" in which audience members are able to connect references from the \"play of images and signs\" to artworks, genre conventions, cultural symbols, or concepts.\n\nHigh culture forms such as fine art and literature have aestheticized violence into a form of autonomous art. In 1991, University of Georgia literature professor Joel Black stated that \"(if) any human act evokes the aesthetic experience of the sublime, certainly it is the act of murder\". Black notes that \"...if murder can be experienced aesthetically, the murderer can in turn be regarded as a kind of artist—a performance artist or anti-artist whose specialty is not creation but destruction\" (1991: 14). This conception of an aesthetic element of murder has a long history; in the 19th century, Thomas de Quincey wrote that \n\"Everything in this world has two handles. Murder, for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle... and that, I confess, is its weak side; or it may also be treated aesthetically, as the Germans call it—that is, in relation to good taste.\"\n\nIn addition to high culture aestheticizations of violence, mass media forms such as newspaper and television news reporting have produced sensationalized reports on crime and warfare. Maria Tatar's book \"Lustmord: Sexual Murder in Weimar Germany\" analyzes murders in pre-Hitler Germany and their artistic representations, investigating \"the chilling motives behind representations that aestheticize violence, and that turn the mutilated female body into an object of fascination\".\nLilie Chouliaraki's article, \"The aestheticization of suffering on television\" (2006), analyzes \"an example of war footage in order to trace the ways in which the tension between presenting airwar as an 'objective' piece of news and as an instance of intense human suffering is resolved in television's strategies of mediation\". For example, Chouliaraki argues that the \"bombardment of Baghdad in 2003 during the Iraq war was filmed in long-shot and presented in a quasiliterary narrative that capitalized on an aesthetics of horror, on sublime spectacle (Boltanski). She says that the \"aestheticization of suffering on television is thus produced by a visual and linguistic complex that eliminates the human pain aspect of suffering, whilst retaining the phantasmagoric effects of a tableau vivant\", producing an \"aestheticization of suffering [that] manages simultaneously to preserve an aura of objectivity and impartiality, and to take a pro-war side in the war footage\".\n\nA number of filmmakers from the 20th century have used aestheticized depictions of violence. According to James Fox, filmmaker Donald Cammell \"...looked upon violence as an artist might look on paint. [He asked:] What are its components? What's its nature? Its glamour?\"\nThomas Harris created a fictional character called Hannibal Lecter, a cannibal and aesthete killer. In the films adapted from his work, \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991) and \"Hannibal\" (2001), directors Jonathan Demme and Ridley Scott, respectively intentionally generate excitement and anticipation when Lecter is about to kill (and eat) a victim. Lecter was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. In David Lynch's \"Blue Velvet\" (1986), the villain of the film, Frank Booth, is an excessively violent man who obsesses over small fetishes (such as blue velvet) when he is attacking and raping his victims; his obsessions help him achieve orgasm.\n\nIn the film \"Man on Fire,\" which tells the story of a burnt-out former Black Ops agent who seeks to avenge the kidnappers of a young girl he was bodyguarding, a character says that the agent is an \"artist\" in killing. He says the man is about to \"paint his masterpiece\" as he seeks out and kills all of the members of the criminal organization who were connected with the child abduction.\n\nIn Xavier Morales' review of Quentin Tarantino's \"\", entitled \"Beauty and violence\", he calls the film \"a groundbreaking aestheticization of violence\". Morales says that the film, which he calls \"easily one of the most violent movies ever made\", \"a breathtaking landscape in which art and violence coalesce into one unforgettable aesthetic experience\".\n\nMorales argues that \"... Tarantino manages to do precisely what Alex de Large was trying to do in Stanley Kubrick's \"A Clockwork Orange:\" he presents violence as a form of expressive art...[in which the]...violence is so physically graceful, visually dazzling and meticulously executed that our instinctual, emotional responses undermine any rational objections we may have. Tarantino is able to transform an object of moral outrage into one of aesthetic beauty...[, in which,]...like all art forms, the violence serves a communicative purpose apart from its aesthetic value\". When the female sword-wielding protagonist \"...skillfully slices and dices her way through...[the opposing fighters]...we get a sense that she is using them as a kind of canvas for her expression of revenge...[,]...like an artist who expresses herself through brush and paint...[she]...expresses herself through sword and blood\".\n\nFilm critics analyzing violent film images that seek to aesthetically please the viewer mainly fall into two categories. Critics who see depictions of violence in film as superficial and exploitative argue that it leads audience members to become desensitized to brutality, thus increasing their aggression. On the other hand, critics who view violence as a type of content, or as a theme, claim it is cathartic and provides \"acceptable outlets for anti-social impulses\".\n\nAdrian Martin argues that critics who hold violent cinema in high regard have developed a response to anti-violence advocates, \"those who decry everything from \"Taxi Driver\" to \"Terminator 2\" as dehumanising, desensitising cultural influences\". Martin claims that critics who value aestheticized violence defend shocking depictions onscreen on the grounds that \"screen violence is not real violence, and should never be confused with it\". He claims that their rebuttal also claims that \"movie violence is fun, spectacle, make-believe; it's dramatic metaphor, or a necessary catharsis akin to that provided by Jacobean theatre; it's generic, pure sensation, pure fantasy. It has its own changing history, its codes, its precise aesthetic uses.\"\n\nMargaret Bruder, a film studies professor at Indiana University and the author of \"Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style,\" proposes that there is a distinction between aestheticized violence and the use of gore and blood in mass market action or war films. She argues that \"aestheticized violence is not merely the excessive use of violence in a film\". Movies such as the popular action film \"Die Hard 2\" are very violent, but they do \"not fall into the category of aestheticized violence because it is not stylistically excessive in a significant and sustained way\".\n\nBut Bruder classifies films as using \"stylized [e.g. aestheticized] violence if they \"revel in guns, gore and explosions, exploiting mise-en-scene not so much to provide narrative environment as to create the appearance of a 'movie' atmosphere against which specifically cinematic spectacle can unfold\". In movies with aestheticized violence, she argues that the \"standard realist modes of editing and cinematography are violated in order to spectacularize the action being played out on the screen\"; directors use \"quick and awkward editing\", \"canted framings\", shock cuts, and slow motion, to emphasize the impacts of bullets or the \"spurting of blood\".\n\nFor viewers of films with aestheticized violence, such as John Woo's movies, she claims that \"One of the many pleasures\" from watching Woo's films, such as \"Hard Target\" is that it gets viewers to recognize how Woo plays with conventions \"from other Woo films\" and how it \"connects up with films...which include imitations of or homages to Woo\". Bruder argues that films with aestheticized violence such as \"\"Hard Target\", \"True Romance\" and \"Tombstone\" are [filled] with... signs\" and indicators, so that \"the stylized violence they contain ultimately serves as...another interruption in the narrative drive\" of the film.\n\nWriting in \"The New York Times\", Dwight Garner reviews the controversy and moral panic surrounding the 1991 novel and 2000 film \"American Psycho\", which concerns Patrick Bateman, \"an Exeter and Harvard grad, a gourmand, a tanning enthusiast and a ruthless fashion critic\" who is also a serial killer. Garner concludes that the film was a \"coal-black satire\" in which \"dire comedy mixes with Grand Guignol. There's demented opera in some of its scenes.\" The book, meanwhile, has acquired \"grudging respect\" and is \"seen as a transgressive bag of broken glass that can be talked about alongside plasma-soaked trips like Anthony Burgess's \"A Clockwork Orange\"\".\n\nGarner claims that the novel's author, Bret Easton Ellis, \"was racing ahead of the culture\" and that his book \"was ahead of its time\": \"The culture has shifted to make room for Bateman. We've developed a taste for barbaric libertines with twinkling eyes and some zing in their tortured souls. Tony Soprano, Walter White from \"\"Breaking Bad\", Hannibal Lecter (who predates \"American Psycho\"\")—here are the most significant pop culture characters of the past 30 years... Thanks to these characters, and to first-person shooter video games, we’ve learned to identify with the bearer of violence and not just cower before him or her.\"\n\nPlato proposed to ban poets from his ideal republic because he feared that their aesthetic ability to construct attractive narratives about immoral behaviour would corrupt young minds. Plato's writings refer to poetry as a kind of rhetoric, whose \"...influence is pervasive and often harmful\". Plato believed that poetry that was \"unregulated by philosophy is a danger to soul and community\". He warned that tragic poetry can produce \"a disordered psychic regime or constitution\" by inducing \"a dream-like, uncritical state in which we lose ourselves in ...sorrow, grief, anger, [and] resentment\". As such, Plato was in effect arguing that \"What goes on in the theater, in your home, in your fantasy life, are connected\" to what one does in real life.\n\nAristotle, though, advocated a useful role for music, drama, and tragedy: a way for people to purge their negative emotions. Aristotle mentions catharsis at the end of his \"Politics\", where he notes that after people listen to music that elicits pity and fear, they \"are liable to become possessed\" by these negative emotions. However, afterwards, Aristotle points out that these people return to \"a normal condition as if they had been medically treated and undergone a purge [catharsis] ... All experience a certain purge [catharsis] and pleasant relief. In the same manner cathartic melodies give innocent joy to men\" (from \"Politics\" VIII:7; 1341b 35-1342a 8).\n\nThe artist Hieronymus Bosch, from the 15th and 16th centuries, used images of demons, half-human animals and machines to evoke fear and confusion to portray the evil of man. The 16th-century artist Pieter Brueghel the Elder depicted \"...the nightmarish imagery that reflect, if in an extreme fashion, popular dread of the Apocalypse and Hell\".\nMathis Gothart-Neithart, a German artist known as \"Grünewald\" (1480–1528) depicted \"intense emotion, especially painful emotion\". His painting of the Crucifixion \"...does not spare the beholder. Grünewald relentlessly brings out all the marks of terrible suffering and agony, induced by the cruelty and torture of the executioners...[vividly conveying] a sense of horror and pain\".\nGrünewald's 'Isenheim Altarpiece' also shows a violent image of Jesus on the cross, \"with his body covered in wounds\", with the focus on \"... Jesus' suffering and his death\".\n\nIn the mid-18th century, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, an Italian etcher, archaeologist and architect active from 1740, did imaginary etchings of prisons that depicted people \"stretched on racks or trapped like rats in maze-like dungeons\", an \"aestheticization of violence and suffering\".\nIn 1849, as revolutions raged in European streets and authorities were putting down protests and consolidating state powers, composer Richard Wagner wrote: \"I have an enormous desire to practice a little artistic terrorism.\"\n\nLaurent Tailhade is reputed to have stated, after Auguste Vaillant bombed the Chamber of Deputies in 1893: \" [What do the victims matter, so long as the gesture is beautiful].\" In 1929 André Breton's Second Manifesto on surrealist art stated that \"\" [The simplest Surrealist act consists of running down into the street, pistols in hand, and firing blindly, as fast as you can pull the trigger, into the crowd].\"\n\nFrench postmodernist theorist Jean Baudrillard argues that whereas modern societies were \"...organized around the production and consumption of commodities\", \"postmodern societies are organized around simulation and the play of images and signs\". As such, in \"...the postmodern media and consumer society, everything becomes an image, a sign, a spectacle\". For Baudrillard, the West's \"commercialization of the whole world...will turn out rather to have been the aestheticization of the whole world—its cosmopolitan spectacularization, its transformation into images, its semiological organization\". As a result, the \"previously separate domains of the economy, art, politics, and sexuality\" become \"collapsed into each other\", and art penetrates \"all spheres of existence.\" Thus, Baudrillard argues that \"[o]ur society has given rise to a general aestheticization: all forms of culture—not excluding anti-cultural ones—are promoted and all models of representation and anti-representation are taken on board\".\n\nWhen a person views an isolated painting, photograph or cartoon, they are viewing a static image. If a photographer takes a still photo of a police officer's struggle to arrest a young man, for example, the denotative meaning might be \"there was a man dressed as a police officer placing his hand on the shoulder of another man of a certain age whilst a photographer took a picture\". On the other hand, the connotative meanings might range from, \"law enforcement in action\" to \"a heroic fight to subdue a dangerous terrorist about to release sarin gas\", to \"police use excessive force to arrest non-violent protesters\", to \"fancy dress party ends badly\". The attribution of the specific subtext is left to the caption writer, the text accompanying the photo, and the audience.\n\nCritic Susan Sontag argued that, through repeated exposure, certain well-known photographs have become \"ethical reference points\", such as the many images depicting the victims and liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp (1977). From this perspective, the subtext of such images, though still connotatively open to interpretation, has been somewhat restrained by familiarity, predominant cultural beliefs regarding the Holocaust, and perhaps by overusage.\n\nIf there is a motion picture or video recording of the previously described scenario of a police officer arresting a man, the filmmakers, videographers, and editors may reframe this scene, by fragmenting the recording, depicting it from different vantage points, editing the material, and reassembling these components. A film editor can produce a non-realistic sequence of intercut, edited images, which forces the audience to interpret those images according to a different set of semiotic rules. Even without editing or alteration, a film or video recordings' \"mise en scène\" and non-verbal signs become much more explicit and enable the audience to attribute meaning to the scenario.\nThe value of this video as a signifier will be determined by its relation to the other signifiers in the system. Thus, if the video is included in a reputable television news program, it will acquire a greater claim to be indexical and its status is more likely to be considered reliable \"evidence\" of real world events. In semiotic terms, the words spoken by the television presenter will be symbolic, and the images will have both iconic and indexical qualities.\n\nThe \"semiotic value\" of the video will change if it is transposed into a polemical or satirical programme, presented by a commentator, or screened with on-screen captions (e.g., \"Crime Wave in the Streets\", or \"Protesters Brutalized by Police\"). These substitute contexts form modality indicators that may help the viewer to assess the plausibility, credibility, or truthfulness of the content. The violence shown on-screen can be aestheticized by the values of the symbolical signs used by the news presenter, by captions placed on-screen, or by the relations with other signifiers in the same programme (e.g., if the arrest video is preceded by a report about \"antisocial and criminal behaviour\").\n\nIf a film or television director staged a similar fictional scene, the audience will be predisposed to consider it less \"real\". They know that the scenario is being filtered through the film maker's sensibilities and the outcome will reflect the director's motives. Hence, the lighting, makeup, costumes, acting methods, cutting, and soundtrack music selection are understood to be combined to inform the audience about the film maker's intentions.\n\nThe culture industry's mass-produced texts and images about crime, violence, and war have been consolidated into genres. Film makers typically choose from a predictable range of narrative conventions and use stereotyped characters, and clichéd symbols and metaphors. Over time, certain styles and conventions of filming and editing are standardised within a medium or a genre. Some conventions tend to naturalise the content and make it seem more real. Other methods deliberately breach convention to create an effect, such as the canted angles, rapid edits, and slow motion shots used in films with aestheticized violence.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48759821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48759821", "title": "Afro-Surrealism", "text": "Afro-Surrealism\n\nAfro-Surrealism or Afrosurrealism is a literary and cultural aesthetic that is a response to mainstream surrealism in order to reflect the lived experience of people of color. First coined by Amiri Baraka in 1974, this movement focuses on the present day experience of African Americans. Afro-Surrealism is based on the manifesto written by D. Scot Miller, in which he says, \"Afro-Surrealism sees that all 'others' who create from their actual, lived experience are surrealist...\" The manifesto delineates Afro-Surrealism from Surrealism and Afro-Futurism. The manifesto also declares the necessity of Afro-Surrealism, especially in San Francisco, California. The manifesto lists ten tenants that Afro-Surrealism follows including how \"Afro-Surrealists restore the cult of the past,\" and how \"Afro-Surreal presupposes that beyond this visible world, there is an invisible world striving to manifest, and it is our job to uncover it.\"\n\nAfro-Surrealism can be seen in music, photography, film, the visual arts and poetry. Notable practitioners of Afro-Surrealism include Ted Joans, Bob Kaufman, Krista Franklin, Kool Keith, Terrence Nance, Will Alexander, India Sky Davis, Kara Walker, Samuel R. Delany, Starr Finch, Romare Bearden and Christopher Burch.\n\nThe AfroSurreal arts movement came about after D. Scot Miller penned The Afrosurreal Manifesto for The San Francisco Bay Guardian in May, 2009. Until that time, the term \"Afrosurreal Expressionism\" was used solely to describe the writings of Henry Dumas by Amiri Baraka. Later that year, Miller spoke with Baraka about extending the term by shortening the description. It was agreed by the two of them that \"Afrosurreal\" without the \"expressionism\" would allow further exploration of the term. . Afrosurrealism may have some similar origins to surrealism in the mid-1920s, in that an aspect of it [Negritude] came after André Breton wrote the Surrealist Manifesto, but as Leopold Senghor points out in Miller's manifesto, “European Surrealism is empirical. African Surrealism is mystical and metaphorical.”.\n\nAfro-Surrealism incorporates aspects of the Harlem Renaissance, Négritude and Black Radical Imagination as described by Professor Robin DG Kelley in his definitive work Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination (2003), and further with his definitive Afrosurreal historical anthology, Black, Brown, & Beige:\nSurrealist Writings from Africa and the Diaspora (2009). Aspects of Afro-Surrealism can be traced to Martiniquan Suzanne Césaire’s discussion of the “revolutionary impetus of surrealism” in the 1940s.\n\nThough much has been written and said about artist/activist/statesmen Aimé Césaire, much more needs to written about his partner Suzanne, a brilliant surrealist thinker, and mother of the Afrosurreal aesthetic. Her quest for “The Marvelous” over the “miserablism” expressed in the usual arts of protest inspired the Tropiques surrealist group, and especially René Ménil.\n\n“The true task of mankind consists solely in the attempt to bring the marvelous into real life,” Ménil says in “Introduction to the Marvelous,”[1930s] “so that life can become more encompassing. So long as the mythic imagination is not able to overcome each and every boring mediocrity, human life will amount to nothing but useless, dull experiences, just killing time, as they say.”\n\nSuzanne Césaire’s proclamation, “Be in permanent readiness for The Marvelous,” quickly became a credo of the movement; the word “marvelous” has since become re-contextualized with regard to contemporary black arts and interventions.\n\nIn his 1956 essay for \"Présence Africaine\" Haitian novelist Jacques Stephen Alexis wrote,\" \"What, then, is the Marvellous, except the imagery in which a people wraps its experience, reflects its conception of the world and of life, its faith, its hope, its confidence in man, in a great justice, and the explanation which it finds for the forces antagonistic to progress?\"\" In his work, Alexis is seen to have an acute sense of reality that is not dissimilar to traditional surrealism, and his coining of the term \"Marvelous Realism\" reflects how he was influenced by the earlier works of the Negritude/Black Surrealist Movement.\n\nAfro-Surrealism was coined by Amiri Baraka in his 1974 essay on Black Arts Movement avant-garde writer Henry Dumas. Baraka notes that Dumas is able to write about ancient mysteries that were simultaneously relevant to the present day. This idea that the past resurfaces to haunt the present day is a crucial to Afro-Surrealism.\n\nCinematographer Arthur Jafa expanded the field of Afro-Surrealism by experimenting with film. Jafa introduces the idea of \"the alien familiar,\" in order to represent the Black experience and its innate surreal characteristics. \"I want it to have something that I and my friends call 'the alien familiar.' If a work succeeds in a way or is able to conjure what a Black cinema would be or what this hypothetical manifestation of this particular tradition in the cinematic arena might be, it should be both alien because you’ve never seen anything quite like it, and at the same time, it should be familiar on some level to Black audiences.\" This focus on the alien aspect of the Black experience, and on Black folk culture, are what separate Afro-Surrealism from magical realism and surrealism.\n\n Unlike Afro-Futurism which speculates on black possibilities in the future, Afrosurrealism, as Miller describes, is about the present. Rather than speculate on the coming of the four horseman, Afrosurrealists understand that they rode through too long ago. Through Afrosurrealism, artists expose this form of the future past that is \"RIGHT NOW.\" Most Afrosurrealists reject the study of the future pushing themselves to focus on the present, the future that has already past.\n\nMuch of Afro-Surrealism is concerned with the everyday life because it is said that there is nothing more surreal than the Black experience. According to Terri Francis, \"Afrosurrealism is art with skin on it where the texture of the object tells its story, how it weathered burial below consciousness, and how it emerged somewhat mysteriously from oceans of forgotten memories and discarded keepsakes. This photograph figures Afrosurrealism as bluesy, kinky-spooky.\"\n\nIn the manifesto from which present day Afrosurrealism is based, writer D. Scot Miller states in a response to Afrofuturism:\n\n\"Afro-Futurism is a diaspora intellectual and artistic movement that turns to science, technology, and science fiction to speculate on black possibilities in the future. Afro-Surrealism is about the present. There is no need for tomorrow’s-tongue speculation about the future. Concentration camps, bombed-out cities, famines, and enforced sterilization have already happened. To the Afro-Surrealist, the Tasers are here. The Four Horsemen rode through too long ago to recall. What is the future? The future has been around so long it is now the past.\"\n\nAs The AfroSurreal Manifesto and Afrofuturism come to the fore in artistic, commercial and academic circles, the struggle between the specific and “the scent” of present-day manifestations of Black absurdity has come with it, posing interesting challenges to both movements. For Afrofuturists, this challenge has been met by inserting Afrocentric elements into its growing pantheon, the intention being to centralize Afrofuturist focus back on the continent of Africa to enhance its specificity. For the Afrosurrealists, the focus has been set at the “here and now” of contemporary Black arts and situations in the Americas, Antilles, and beyond, searching for the nuanced “scent” of those current manifestations.\n\nAfro-Surrealist scholar Rochelle Spencer identifies at least three different subgenres of black speculative art, and Spencer argues that Afro-Surrealism is the most present-focus, though it is not devoid of technology and may include allusions to modern technology. According to Francis, the juxtaposition between the old and the present day is what makes Afro-Surrealism so unique. As Francis puts it, \"Surrealism here, the Afro-surreal, like the marvelous discussed above, is actually a realism so real, so contrary to the norms of publicized blackness, that it represents a rupture, a radical break from ordinary understanding such that the old feels new—because it was never known.\n\nIn \"Zong!\", M. NourbSe Philip crafts a powerful counter-narrative surrounding the events of the \"Zong\" massacre. Utilizing the words from the legal decision to build her poetry, Philip rejects the idea of an archival past. Instead Philip looks to the present moment to understand how to read this legal decision and understand the case. Following the footsteps of Toni Morrison’s \"Beloved\", Philip presupposes the notion of a past that is not past allowing these past artifacts to haunt the present moment. Rather than organize the fragments, Philip allows the fragments to tell themselves. This is not to say that Philip gives the fragments voices, but instead gives them space. The space in the poem allows Philip’s audience to hear the silence of these voices, to truly understand the missing narratives form the past and the role that has on the present.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Toni Morrison’s \"Beloved\" remains an important milestone for Afrosurrealists. Here, Morrison imagines a narrative of a slave women grieving the death of her baby daughter, Beloved. With no trace of a past, Beloved reappears of on the steps of 124, confused and looking for her mother. Following this moment, the novel crafts a haunting tale of a woman seeking to understand the sudden reappearance of her daughter and the scars left behind from slavery. In \"Beloved,\" Morrison attempts to come to grip with the legacies left by slavery, challenging the notion that these legacies exits only from the past. From the epigraph, “\"Sixty Million and more\",” Morrison presupposes there is no way to count those affected from slavery and additionally, that the number is ever-growing into the present. In her award-winning novel, Morrison expands the idea of the past, attempting to demonstrate the past is ever present and moreover, that the past is RIGHT NOW.\n"}
{"id": "2228629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228629", "title": "Argentine literature", "text": "Argentine literature\n\nArgentine literature, i.e. the set of literary works produced by writers who originated from Argentina, is one of the most prolific, relevant and influential in the whole Spanish speaking world, with renowned writers such as Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, Leopoldo Lugones and Ernesto Sabato.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the name of the country itself comes from a Latinism which first appeared in a literary source: Martin del Barco Centenera's epic poem \"La Argentina\" (1602). This composition runs 10.000 verses and describes the landscape as well as the conquest of the territory. The word was reintroduced in \"Argentina manuscrita\", a prose chronicle by Ruy Díaz de Guzmán.\n\nArgentine literature began around 1550 with the work of Matías Rojas de Oquendo and Pedro González de Prado (from Santiago del Estero, the first important urban settlement in Argentina), who wrote prose and poetry. They were partly inspired by oral aboriginal poetry—in particular, according to Carlos Abregú Virreyra, by the \"lules\", \"juríes\", \"diaguitas\" and \"tonocotés\". A symbiosis emerged between the aboriginal and Spanish traditions, creating a distinct literature, geographically limited (well into the 18th century) to the Argentine north and central regions, with the province of Córdoba as its center, due to the foundation of the National University of Córdoba. Two names stand out from this period: Gaspar Juárez Baviano, and Antonia de la Paz y Figueroa, also known as \"Beata Antula\".\n\nGradually, with the economic prosperity of the port, the cultural axis moved eastward. The letters of the colonial age (Viceroyalty-neoclassicism, baroque and epic) grew under the protection of the independentist fervor: Vicente López y Planes, Pantaleón Rivarola and Esteban de Luca.\n\nDuring the 17th century, Argentine baroque literature was poor in comparison with that from Europe and some other parts of the New World. The only remarkable poet of this period was fray José Luis de Tejeda who wrote \"Coronas líricas\" and \"El peregrino de Babilonia\"\n\nAs in the rest of the continent, strong feelings of emancipation from Spain were present in Argentina. Before independence, some neoclassical authors such as Juan Cruz Varela produced numerous works related with this revolutionary spirit but still under the paradoxical Spanish domain.\n\nArgentina's true break with Spanish tradition was manifested in literature through the adoption of French romanticism as a model, postulating the return to popular sources and to the medieval. This aesthetic and intellectual was brought by Esteban Echeverría who wrote the first local and realistic story, \"El Matadero\" (\"The slaughterhouse\"), as well as the nativist poem \"La Cautiva\" (\"The Captive\"), with the Pampas as its background. His barbed wit and opposition to powerful Buenos Aires governor Juan Manuel de Rosas forced him into exile.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century José Mármol published the first Argentine novel, \"Amalia\" (1851–1852), a historical novel set during the dark year of 1840 which mixed fictional characters (Amalia, Daniel Bello, Eduardo Belgrano) with actual historical characters like Juan Manuel de Rosas.\n\nAs Rosas' power increased, more literary works from the opposition were produced, such as Juan Bautista Alberdi's play \"El Gigante Amapolas\", a good example of local sainete. In the genre of essay, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento published his \"Facundo\", a particular (re)vision of Facundo Quiroga's life from a deterministic point of view. Sarmiento conveyed aspects of sociology and semiotics in this analysis.\n\nEcheverría, Mármol and Sarmiento are among the group of writers known as Generación del 37, who are considered the first generation of local intellectuals.\n\nPoetry lessened in combative spirit and turned towards the anecdotal and sentimental: Carlos Guido y Spano and Ricardo Gutiérrez, the chronicle writers of folk literature. Lucio V. Mansilla published in 1870 \"Una excursión a los indios ranqueles\", a sort of chronicle of a voluntary expedition to sign a peace treaty with the Indians. His work (enrolled in a realistic aesthetic) anticipated Generación del '80, which would be deeply influenced by modernism. Juana Manuela Gorriti was one of the first popular female writers, mainly due to her melodramatic narrative works like the novel \"La hija del mazorquero\" and the foundation of \"La alborada\", a cultural magazine.\n\nEuropean-oriented, indeed Euro-centric, themes and styles would remain the norm in Argentine letters, especially from Buenos Aires, during this century. The (romantic) poetry as \"La cautiva\" or the latter \"Santos Vega\" by Rafael Obligado gave a lot of importance to the nature of the \"pampa\", sharing some elements with a picturesque, imitation-gaucho literature, purporting to use the language of the gauchos and to reflect their mentality. The first current is known as \"poesía nativista\" (nativist poetry) and became a literary tradition. The second (known as \"poesía gauchesca\") developed in parallel as a part of that generation's understanding of national identity. Although it also is a product of literary authors, this writing takes the voice of the gaucho as protagonist from the beginning. \"Gauchesca\" is related to \"payador's singing\", a payador being a modern equivalent of the illiterate medieval singers. A payador's work, in opposition to \"gauchesca\", is sung spontaneously.\n\nThe first \"gauchesco\" author was Bartolomé Hidalgo who wrote during the war of independence and therefore his works had a strong political ideology. His compositions were mainly \"cielitos\" (\"payadoresque\" songs but with provocative political messages) and \"diálogos patrióticos\" (conversations between two characters about current affairs).\n\nIn a second period, \"gauchesca\" was influenced by political-faction fights. Estanislao del Campo, and Hilario Ascasubi are the most representative writers of this period. Del Campo wrote 'Fausto', a poem which has been read both as a parody of gauchesca and an intelligent joke towards city people. In the poem, Anastasio El Pollo meets a friend and tells him his impressions on particular event: he has seen the Devil. What El Pollo doesn't know (or pretends he doesn't) is that all he saw was actually an opera performance at Teatro Colón.\n\nThe last author of gauchesca is José Hernández, the author of Martín Fierro. Gauchesca leaves its political influences and becomes social in the sense that gauchos are disappearing, mainly due to Sarmiento and the new economic model. Hernández is considered the responsible for consolidating the gauchesco style.\n\nThe generation of 1880 emphasized the European color and cultural supremacy of Buenos Aires. The migratory current of mixed ethnicity accentuated the change of the \"big village\" for the \"cosmopolitan metropolis\". The poetry of this period is lyric: Leopoldo Díaz y Almafuerte. The latter usually depicts the worker's life in passionate attacks against the contradictions of contemporary society. Almafuerte (pseudonym of Pedro Bonifacio Palacios) was also a teacher and a journalist whose opinions and articles gave him a lot of problems.\n\nEssay is a recent genre that developed in the late 19th century: José Manuel Estrada, Pedro Goyena and Joaquín V. González.\n\nNarrative works oscillated between social issues and folk literature. The predominant tendency was Realism, best represented by Miguel Cané in his autobiographical novel \"Juvenilia\". Other writers influenced by realism were Lucio V. Mansilla, Francisco Sicardi, Benito Lynch and Carlos María Ocantos. Naturalism was also an important tendency towards the end of the century. Argentine Naturalism was commanded by Eugenio Cambaceres in his novels \"Sin rumbo\" and \"Música sentimental\", almost forgotten today. Cambaceres was inspired by Émile Zola's theory about the naturalistic approach to literary work, but its ideology suffered considerable alterations. Julián Martel and Antonio Argerich with added a highly loaded moral touch to Argentine naturalism.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, led by the Nicaraguan Rubén Darío, modernism appears in Latin American literature. Preciosity of manner and a strong influence from Symbolism sum up the new genre, which inspires the clearest voice in poetry, Leopoldo Lugones, who was the author of the first Argentine science fiction story. The first truly modern generation in Argentine literature is the Martinfierristas (c. 1922). The movement contributes an intellectual doctrine in which a number of current trends come together: the trend represented by the Florida group, adscript to ultraísmo, with Oliverio Girondo, Jorge Luis Borges, Leopoldo Marechal and Macedonio Fernández; and the trend of Boedo, impressed by Russian realism, with Raúl González Tuñón, César Tiempo y Elías Catelnuovo. Ricardo Güiraldes, however, remains classical in style, giving a whole new freshness to \"gauchesca\" poetry and writing what is perhaps the novel, \"Don Segundo Sombra\".\n\nBenito Lynch (1885–1951), an eccentric short-story writer who, like Güiraldes, does not easily fit into any \"generation\", wrote his quirky tales in an enchanted neo-\"gauchoesque\" manner about this time.\nBetween the end of this decade and the beginning of the following one emerged the \"Novísimos\" (\"Newest\"), a generation of poets (Arturo Cambours Ocampo, Carlos Carlino and José Portogalo), fiction writers (Arturo Cerretani, Roberto Arlt, Luis Maria Albamonte and Luis Horacio Velázquez) and playwrights (Roberto Valenti, Juan Oscar Ponferrada and Javier Villafañe). The group promoted philosophical reflection and a new essence for \"Argentinidad\". Leopoldo Marechal's novel Adán Buenosayres, published in 1948 and praised by Julio Cortázar in 1949.\n\nAlso worthy of note is the literary work of Leonardo Castellani (1899–1981), a Jesuit priest who left a considerable bulk of essays, novels, tales and poetry. Expelled from the Company of Jesus, the outspoken Castellani was also widely ignored – like his contemporary Marechal – by the literary \"intelligentsia\" of his time due to his nationalist ideology.\n\nThe \"Generation of 1937\" centers on poetry, where it developed the descriptive, nostalgic and meditative in the work of Ricardo E. Molinari, Vicente Barbieri, Olga Orozco, León Benarós and Alfonso Sola Gonzáles. Fiction writers subscribed to idealism and magic realism, María Granata, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Julio Cortázar, Silvina Ocampo) or to a subtler form of realism Manuel Mujica Laínez, Ernesto L. Castro, Ernesto Sabato and Abelardo Arias) with some urban touches, as well as folk literature (Joaquín Gómez Bas and Roger Plá).\n\nEssayists do not abound. Antonio Pagés Larraya, Emilio Carilla, Luis Soler Cañas are some of the few who stand out, although the greatest Argentine essayist after Sarmiento – Ezequiel Martínez Estrada – also belonged to the Generation of '37. Many of these writers and a number of European ones contributed extensively to \"Sur\", a literary journal published by Victoria Ocampo, a noted commentator on the day's culture.\n\nIn 1950, another milestone arose: the New Humanism, a response to World War II and its aftermath. On one level are avant-gardists like Raúl Gustavo Aguirre, Edgar Bayley and Julio Llinás; on another, existentialists: José Isaacson, Julio Arístides and Miguel Ángel Viola. Further away are those who reconcile both tendencies with a regionalist tendency: Alfredo Veiravé, Jaime Dávalos and Alejandro Nicotra. Other fiction writers left a highly charged testimony of the times: Beatriz Guido, David Viñas, Marco Denevi and Silvina Bullrich. In a majority of the writers, a strong influence of Anglo-Saxon and Italian poetry can be perceived. Of particular interest are the poetic works of two of Marechal's disciples, the poets Rafael Squirru and Fernando Demaría.\n\nA new trend started in 1960, continuing until about 1990. Its influences are heterogeneous: Sartre, Camus, Eluard; some Spanish writers, like Camilo José Cela; and previous Argentine writers like Borges, Arlt, Cortázar and Marechal. Two trends were in evidence: the tracing of metaphysical time and historicity (Horacio Salas, Alejandra Pizarnik, Ramón Plaza) and the examination of urban and social disarray: (Abelardo Castillo, Marta Lynch, Manuel Puig, Alicia Steinberg).\n\nThe 1970s were a dark period for intellectual creation in Argentina. The epoch is characterised by the exile (Juan Gelman, Antonio Di Benedetto) or death (Roberto Santoro, Haroldo Conti, and Rodolfo Walsh) of major writers. The remaining literary journalists, like Liliana Heker, veiled their opinions in their work. Some journalists (Rodolfo Walsh), poets (Agustín Tavitián and Antonio Aliberti), fiction writers (Osvaldo Soriano, Fernando Sorrentino), and essayists (Ricardo Herrera, María Rosa Lojo) stood out among the vicissitudes and renewed the field of ethical and aesthetic ideas.\n\nThe 1990s are marked by reunion among survivors of different generations, in an intellectual coalition for the review of values and texts as Argentina faced the end of the century. Some examples are Alan Pauls, Mario Areca, Aníbal Cristobo, Ernesto de Sanctis, Marco Denevi, Edgar Brau and some more.\n\n\n\n"}

It was discovered in the 19th century during rebuilding works at the basilica di San Paolo fuori le Mura, in Rome, Italy.\n\nTogether with the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus, it one of the most important examples of Christian-Roman sculpture of the Constantinian era. It draws its name from its clear references to the dogmas of the Council of Nicaea (325), in particular to Christ being consubstantial with God the Father, as shown (for example) by the scene of a figure with the appearance of Jesus between Adam and Eve, though whether the figure is to be understood as Christ or God the Father is less clear – the dogmatic point works either way.\n\nThe front face is split into two registers, typical of the style of the time, with Old Testament and New Testament subjects and a central shell-shaped \"clipeus\" containing the portraits of the dead couple, embraced and wearing marital clothes typical of the 4th century (\"tunica manicata\", \"dalmatina\" and \"toga contabulata\" by the man, who holds a \"rotulus\" in his hand, and tunic and palla by the woman). The heads are basic types, showing there was either no desire or not enough time to personalize the sarcophagus.\n\nIn the upper register are five episodes, two from the book of Genesis and two miracles of Christ:\n\nIn the lower register are six scenes, one linked to Christ's birth, two to the Bible and three to St Peter:\n\nThe sarcophagus can be dated to between 330 and 340 due to the male hairstyles (apart from those of Christ and Peter), the squat square figures and the lack of calligraphic detail. There are echoes of the previous \"plebeian\" official art, which has led some to suggest that the sarcophagus is from the same workshop that produced and amended the reliefs for the Arch of Constantine (dedicated in 315).\n\nThe account in Genesis naturally credits the Creation to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father. However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\", and New Testament references to Christ as creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the Logos, or pre-existing Christ. \nA number of other sarcophagi, most conveniently collected in the same Vatican collection as the Dogmatic Sarcophagus, also show groups of three figures usually interpreted as representing the Trinity in scenes from Genesis. Sometimes one figure is beardless, while the other two are bearded. Given the funerary context, and that adjacent scenes often show New Testament miracles, including the Raising of Lazarus, the emphasis of these scenes may relate as much to the overcoming of sin and hope of new life as the Fall of Man.\n\nChrist was compared to Adam in Romans 5:14–21, and was sometimes called the \"new Adam\", especially in connection with baptism (at this period catechumens were apparently naked when this was administered). This may also be referred to in the second scene, or the central figure may represent the Divine Logos, who is also shown with the appearance of Jesus. The scene represents the \"division of labours\" between Adam and Eve; the central figure holds a sheaf of corn in one hand and a dead hare (in another Vatican example a lamb) in the other, although one might expect hunting hares to be Adam's task and agriculture Eve's, rather than the opposite as the sarcophagus seems to suggest.\n\nAdam and Eve also functioned as typological forerunners of Jesus and Mary, and the Tree of Knowledge of the Cross of the Crucifixion. In addition they represented faithfulness in marriage, and scenes of them between the Logos are interpreted by some as representing their marriage ceremony, suitable for the sarcophagus of a married couple.\n\n\n"}

Haslund has described her father as an \"adventurer\", and they travelled regularly during her early life. She became a student in 1935, and studied languages in both England, Germany and France before World War II. She graduated from the University of Oslo in 1941 with the cand.philol. degree. In 1940 she married businessman Sverre Fjeld Halvorsen (1910–2005), who was imprisoned at Grini and in Poland during World War II, but survived.\n\nHaslund used to live in Blommenholm, but died, aged 91, in Oslo.\n\nHaslund made her literary debut in 1945 with the short story collection \"Også vi –\". The following year came the publication of her first novel, \"Siste halvår\", about the adolescence of young girls. The independent continuation \"Det hendte ingenting\" (1948) was virtually ignored by the press at the time, but has later been regarded as one of her most important books. Narrated by shy Edle Henriksen, a student at the University of Oslo in 1939, the novel is about friendship among three women students, as well as Edle's unrealized lesbian longing. It was translated into English in 1987, with the title \"Nothing Happened\". Hafslund's literary breakthrough was proclaimed with the emerging of \"Middag hos Molla\" (1951), and again with her next novel, \"Krise i august\" (1954).\n\nHaslund has written several audio plays for radio. Her debut as playwright was the audio play \"Himmelsk dilemma\" (1952). Her play \"Kjære Nils\" (1956) was awarded a prize for \"best audio play for children\". She was a board member of the Writers' Guild of Norway from 1961 to 1967, and vice chair from 1967 to 1974.\n\nShe has written several books for children and youth, such as \"Frøken Askeladd\" (1953), \"Barskinger på Brånåsen\" (1960), and \"Mor streiker\" (1981). A selection of her essays is found in the collections \"Født til klovn\" (1977), \"Kvinner, fins de?\" (1980) and \"Hønesvar til hanefar\" (1983). She has also written three memoir books, \"Som plommen i egget\" (1987), \"Med vingehest i manesjen\" (1989) and \"Ikke naken, ikke kledd\" (1992).\n\nShe worked as a literary critic for \"Aftenposten\" from 1970 to 1990, and editor-in-chief of the magazine \"Ordet\" from 1966 to 1967. She was a columnist in several newspapers, including \"Klassekampen\" and \"Budstikka\".\n\nHaslund was board member of the Norwegian branch of International PEN from 1955 to 1957, and vice chairman from 1964 to 1967. She was a board member of \"Forfatterforeningen av 1952\"—a breakaway faction of the Norwegian Authors' Union which lasted from 1952 to 1966—from 1961 to 1963 and chaired the Norwegian Writers for Children from 1965 to 1970. In the Norwegian Authors' Union she was a board member from 1966 to 1970, vice chairman from 1970 to 1971 and chairman from 1971 to 1975. She received honorary membership in the Norwegian Authors' Union in 1975, and in the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights in 1995. For the rest of her life she was the only honorary member of the Association for Women's Rights. She was a member of the board of Riksteateret from 1969 to 1977, a member of the Norwegian Language Council from 1976 to 1980 and a deputy member of the Arts Council Norway from 1977 to 1980. She was also a board member of \"Klassekampen\".\n\nHaslund served as a deputy representative to the Norwegian Parliament from Oslo during the term 1958–1961 and from Akershus during the term 1961–1965. She took John Lyng's seat while he served as Prime Minister between August and September 1963. Despite her affiliation to the Conservative Party of Norway at that time, she was called \"Red Ebba\" during her time in the Norwegian Authors' Union. She was inspired by the radical feminism of the 1960s and 1970s, especially by the activity of Norwegian researcher and socialist politician Berit Ås. In a 2007 interview Haslund stated that she does not vote Conservative, but Liberal.\n\nEbba Haslund was awarded the Norwegian Booksellers' Prize in 1966 for the novel \"Det trange hjerte\", and the Riksmål Society Literature Prize for \"Syndebukkens krets\" in 1968. She received the Ossietzky Award in 2006 and the Fritt Ord Honorary Award in 2007.\n"}
{"id": "1569732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1569732", "title": "Entry point", "text": "Entry point\n\nIn computer programming, an entry point is where control is transferred from a loader or operating system to a computer program, at which place the processor enters a program or a code fragment and execution begins. (It's possible that the computer program itself is the operating system, in which case the launcher is the bootloader). In some operating systems or programming languages, the initial entry is not part of the program but of the runtime library, in which case the runtime library initializes the program and then the runtime library enters the program. In other cases, the program may call the runtime library before doing anything when it is entered for the first time, and, after the runtime library returns, the actual code of the program begins to execute. This marks the transition from load time (and dynamic link time, if present) to run time.\n\nIn simple layouts, programs begin their execution at the beginning, which is common in scripting languages, simple binary executable formats, and boot loaders. In other cases, the entry point is at some other fixed point, which is some memory address than can be an absolute address or relative address (offset).\n\nAlternatively, execution of a program can begin at a named point, either with a conventional name defined by the programming language or operating system, or at a caller-specified name. In many programming languages, notably C, this named point is a function called codice_1; as a result, the entry point is often called the main function.\n\nA common form of the main function in C, C# or C++, is a static method, either returning no data (codice_2) or a number (codice_3), also known as the return code.\nEntry points apply both to source code and to executable files. However, in day-to-day software development, programmers specify the entry points only in source code, which makes them much better known. Entry points in executable files depend on the application binary interface (ABI) of the actual operating system, and are generated by the compiler or linker (if not fixed by the ABI). Non-executable object files may also have entry points, which are used later by the linker when generating entry points of an executable file.\n\nEntry points are capable of passing on command arguments, variables, or other information as a local variable used by the codice_4 method. This way, specific options may be set upon execution of the program, and then interpreted by the program. Many programs use this as an alternative way to configure different settings, or perform a set variety of actions using a single program.\n\nIn most of today's popular programming languages and operating systems, a computer program usually only has a single \"entry point\".\n\nIn C, C++, D, Rust and Kotlin programs this is a function named codice_1; in Java it is a static method named codice_1 (although the class must be specified at the invocation time), and in C# it is a static method named codice_7.\n\nIn major operating systems, the standard executable format has a single entry point. In the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), used in Unix and Unix-like systems such as Linux, the entry point is specified in the codice_8 field of the ELF header. In the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc), the entry point used by the linker is the codice_9 symbol. Similarly, in the Portable Executable format, used in Microsoft Windows, the entry point is specified by the codice_10 field, which is inherited from COFF. In COM files, the entry point is at the fixed offset of 0100h.\n\nOne notable modern exception to the single-entry-point paradigm is Android. Unlike applications on most other operating systems, Android applications do not have a single entry point there is no codice_1 function, for example. Instead of a single entry point, they have essential components (which include activities and services) which the system can instantiate and run as needed.\n\nAn occasionally used technique is the fat binary, which consists of several executables for different targets packaged in a single binary. Most commonly, this is implemented by a single overall entry point, which is compatible with all targets and branches to the target-specific entry point. Alternative techniques include storing separate executables in separate forks, each with its own entry point, which is then selected by the operating system.\n\nHistorically, and in some contemporary legacy systems, such as VMS and OS/400, computer programs have a multitude of \"entry points\", each corresponding to the different functionalities of the program. The usual way to denote entry points, as used system-wide in VMS and in PL/I and MACRO programs, is to append them at the end of the name of the executable image, delimited by a dollar sign ($), e.g. codice_12.\n\nThe Apple I computer also used this to some degree. For example, an alternative entry point in Apple I's BASIC would keep the BASIC program useful when the reset button was accidentally pushed.\n\nIn general, programs can exit at any time in an unstructured way, by returning to the operating system or crashing. Scripting languages typically end by reaching the end of the program, but for binaries the control must return to the operating system or it will simply run off the end of the process's memory, either executing whatever code is there or (in modern operating systems) resulting in a memory access violation and termination by the operating system.\n\nUsually, there is not a single exit point specified in a program. However, in other cases runtimes ensure that programs always terminate in a structured way via a single exit point, which is guaranteed unless the runtime itself crashes; this allows cleanup code to be run, such as codice_13 handlers. This can be done by either requiring that programs terminate by returning from the main function, by calling a specific exit function, or by the runtime catching exceptions or operating system signals.\n\nIn many programming languages, the codice_1 function is where a program starts its execution. It enables high-level organization of the program's functionality, and typically has access to the command arguments given to the program when it was executed.\n\nThe main function is generally the first programmer-written function that runs when a program starts, and is invoked directly from the system-specific initialization contained in the runtime environment (crt0 or equivalent). However, some languages can execute user-written functions before main runs, such as the constructors of C++ global objects.\n\nIn other languages, notably scripting languages, execution simply begins at the start of the program.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of programming languages follows, describing their way of defining the main entry point:\n\nIn APL, when a workspace is loaded, the contents of \"quad LX\" (latent expression) variable is interpreted as an APL expression and executed.\n\nIn C and C++, the function prototype of the main function looks like one of the following:\n\nThe parameters codice_15, \"argument count\", and codice_16, \"argument vector\", respectively give the number and values of the program's command-line arguments. The names of codice_15 and codice_16 may be any valid identifier in C, but it is common convention to use these names. In C++, the names are to be taken literally, and the \"void\" in the parameter list is to be omitted, if strict conformance is desired. Other platform-dependent formats are also allowed by the C and C++ standards, except that in C++ the return type must always be codice_3; for example, Unix (though not POSIX.1) and Windows have a third argument giving the program's environment, otherwise accessible through codice_20 in codice_21:\n\nDarwin-based operating systems, such as macOS, have a fourth parameter containing arbitrary OS-supplied information, such as the path to the executing binary:\n\nThe value returned from the main function becomes the exit status of the process, though the C standard only ascribes specific meaning to two values: codice_22 (traditionally 0) and codice_23. The meaning of other possible return values is implementation-defined. In case a return value is not defined by the programmer, an implicit codice_24 at the end of the codice_25 function is inserted by the compiler; this behavior is required by the C++ standard.\n\nIt is guaranteed that codice_15 is non-negative and that codice_27 is a null pointer. By convention, the command-line arguments specified by codice_15 and codice_16 include the name of the program as the first element if codice_15 is greater than 0; if a user types a command of \"codice_31\", the shell will initialise the codice_32 process with codice_33 and codice_34. As codice_35 is the name that processes appear under in codice_36, codice_37 etc., some programs, such as daemons or those running within an interpreter or virtual machine (where codice_35 would be the name of the host executable), may choose to alter their argv to give a more descriptive codice_35, usually by means of the codice_40 system call.\n\nThe codice_25 function is special; normally every C and C++ program must define it exactly once.\n\nIf declared, codice_25 must be declared as if it has external linkage; it cannot be declared codice_43 or codice_44.\n\nIn C++, codice_25 must be in the global namespace (i.e. codice_46), cannot be overloaded, and cannot be a member function, although the name is not otherwise reserved, and may be used for member functions, classes, enumerations, or non-member functions in other namespaces. In C++ (unlike C) codice_25 cannot be called recursively and cannot have its address taken.\n\nWhen executing a program written in C#, the CLR searches for a static method marked with the codice_48 IL directive, which takes either no arguments, or a single argument of type codice_49, and has a return type of codice_2 or codice_3, and executes it.\n\nCommand-line arguments are passed in codice_52, similar to how it is done in Java. For versions of codice_4 returning an integer, similar to both C and C++, it is passed back to the environment as the exit status of the process.\n\nSince C#7.1 there are four more possible signatures of the entry point, which allow asynchronous execution in the codice_4 Method.\n\nThe codice_55 and codice_56 types are the asynchronous equivalents of codice_2 and codice_3.\n\nClean is a functional programming language based on graph rewriting. The initial node is called codice_59 and is of type codice_60 if it \"changes\" the world or some fixed type if the program only prints the result after reducing codice_59.\n\nOr even simpler\n\nOne tells the compiler which option to use to generate the executable file.\n\nANSI Common Lisp does not define a main function; instead, the code is read and evaluated from top to bottom in a source file. However, the following code will emulate a main function.\n\nIn D, the function prototype of the main function looks like one of the following:\n\nCommand-line arguments are passed in codice_52, similar to how it is done in C# or Java. For versions of codice_25 returning an integer, similar to both C and C++, it is passed back to the environment as the exit status of the process.\n\nFORTRAN does not have a main subroutine or function. Instead a codice_64 statement as the first line can be used to specify that a program unit is a main program, as shown below. The codice_64 statement cannot be used for recursive calls.\n\nSome versions of Fortran, such as those on the IBM System/360 and successor mainframes, do not support the PROGRAM statement. Many compilers from other software manufacturers will allow a fortran program to be compiled without a PROGRAM statement. In these cases, whatever module that has any non-comment statement where no SUBROUTINE, FUNCTION or BLOCK DATA statement occurs, is considered to be the Main program.\n\nUsing GNAT, the programmer is not required to write a function called codice_1; a source file containing a single subprogram can be compiled to an executable. The binder will however create a package codice_67, which will contain and export a C-style main function.\n\nIn Go programming language, program execution starts with the codice_1 function of the codice_69\n\nThere is no way to access arguments or a return code outside of the standard library in Go. These can be accessed via codice_70 and codice_71 respectively, both of which are included in the codice_72 package.\n\nA Haskell program must contain a name called codice_1 bound to a value of type codice_74, for some type codice_75; which is usually codice_76. codice_77 is a monad, which organizes side-effects in terms of purely functional code. The codice_1 value represents the side-effects-ful computation done by the program. The result of the computation represented by codice_1 is discarded; that is why codice_1 usually has type codice_76, which indicates that the type of the result of the computation is codice_82, the unit type, which contains no information.\n\nCommand line arguments are not given to codice_1; they must be fetched using another IO action, such as codice_84.\n\nJava programs start executing at the main method, which has the following method heading:\n\nCommand-line arguments are passed in codice_52. As in C and C++, the name \"codice_25\" is special. Java's main methods do not return a value directly, but one can be passed by using the codice_87 method.\n\nUnlike C, the name of the program is not included in codice_52, because the name of the program is exactly the name of the class that contains the main method called, so it is already known. Also unlike C, the number of arguments need not be included, since arrays in Java have a field that keeps track of how many elements there are.\n\nAnother aspect unique to Java is that the main function must be included within a class, and then called manually by the runtime. This is because in Java everything has to be contained within a class. For instance, a hello world program in Java may look like so:\n\nTo run this program, one must call codice_89 in the directory where the compiled class file (which itself must be named codice_90) exists. Alternatively, executable JAR files use a manifest file to specify the entry point in a manner that is filesystem-independent from the user's perspective.\n\nIn FMSLogo, the procedures when loaded do not execute. To make them execute, it is necessary to use this code:\n\nNote that the variable codice_91 is used for the startup list of actions, but the convention is that this calls another procedure that runs the actions. That procedure may be of any name.\n\nOCaml has no codice_1 function. Programs are evaluated from top to bottom.\n\nCommand-line arguments are available in an array named codice_93 and the exit status is 0 by default.\n\nExample:\nIn Pascal, the main procedure is the only unnamed procedure in the program. Because Pascal programs have the procedures and functions in a more rigorous top-down order than C, C++ or Java programs, the main procedure is usually the last procedure in the program. Pascal does not have a special meaning for the name \"codice_1\" or any similar name.\n\nCommand-line arguments are counted in codice_95 and accessible as strings by codice_96, with n between 0 and codice_95.\n\nNote that \"unit\" or \"module\" based versions of Pascal start the main module with the PROGRAM keyword, while other separately compiled modules start with UNIT (UCSD/Borland) or MODULE (ISO). The unnamed function in modules is often module initialization, and run before the main program starts.\n\nIn Perl, there is no main function. Statements are executed from top to bottom.\n\nCommand-line arguments are available in the special array codice_98. Unlike C, codice_98 does not contain the name of the program, which is codice_100.\n\nPHP does not have a \"main\" function. Starting from the first line of a PHP script, any code not encapsulated by a function header is executed as soon as it is seen.\n\nIn Pike syntax is similar to that of C and C++. The execution begins at codice_1. The \"codice_15\" variable keeps the number of arguments passed to the program. The \"codice_16\" variable holds the value associated with the arguments passed to the program.\n\nExample:\nPython programs are evaluated top-to-bottom, as is usual in scripting languages: the entry point is the start of the source code. Since definitions must precede use, programs are typically structured with definitions at the top and the code to execute at the bottom (unindented), similar to code for a one-pass compiler, such as in Pascal.\n\nAlternatively, a program can be structured with an explicit codice_1 function containing the code to be executed when a program is executed directly, but which can also be invoked by importing the program as a module and calling the function. This can be done by the following idiom, which relies on the internal variable codice_105 being set to codice_106 when a program is executed, but not when it is imported as a module (in which case it is instead set to the module name); there are many variants of this structure:\n\nIn this idiom, the call to the named entry point codice_1 is explicit, and the interaction with the operating system (receiving the arguments, calling system exit) are done explicitly by library calls, which are ultimately handled by the Python runtime. This contrast with C, where these are done \"implicitly\" by the runtime, based on convention.\n\nThe QB64 language has no main function, the code that is not within a function, or subroutine is executed first, from top to bottom:\n\nprint \"Hello World! a =\";\na = getInteger(1.8d): print a\n\nfunction getInteger(n as double)\nend function\n\nCommand line arguments (if any) can be read using the COMMAND$ function:\n\ndim shared commandline as string\ncommandline = COMMAND$\n\n'Several space-separared command line arguments can be read using COMMAND$(n)\ncommandline1 = COMMAND$(2)\nIn Ruby, there is no distinct main function. The code written without additional \"codice_108\", \"codice_109\" enclosures is executed directly, step by step, in context of special \"codice_1\" object. This object can be referenced using:\n\nand contain the following properties:\n\nMethods defined without additional classes/modules are defined as private methods of the \"codice_1\" object, and, consequently, as private methods of almost any other object in Ruby:\n\nNumber and values of command-line arguments can be determined using the single codice_112 constant array:\n\nNote that first element of codice_112, codice_114, contains the first command-line argument, not the name of program executed, as in C. The name of program is available using codice_100 or codice_116.\n\nSimilar to Python, one could use:\n\nIn Visual Basic, when a project contains no forms, the startup object may be the codice_4 procedure. The codice_118 function can be optionally used to access the argument portion of the command line used to launch the program:\nIn Xojo, there are two different project types, each with a different main entry point. Desktop (GUI) applications start with the codice_119 event of the project's codice_120 object. Console applications start with the codice_121 event of the project's codice_122 object. In both instances, the main function is automatically generated, and cannot be removed from the project.\n\n\n"}

The commission of such a treatise was perhaps considered important as the elephant played an important role in affirming the idea of monarchy and exercising state power.\n\nThe treatise itself was written for a ruling monarch, and almost entirely from the view of sustaining monarchy – which elephants are suitable for the kingdom, how they should be trained for use by the nobility and for the purpose of war. The \"Hastividyārnava\" has an elaborate taxonomic system describing the various types of elephants and their character, and it was perhaps considered important for a king to have knowledge regarding elephants, as it is mentioned that only the learned king recognizes particular breeds.\n\nThe two artists \"Dilbar\" and \"Dosai\" who painted the manuscript were probably not very familiar with the landscape of Assam and hence the quality of the landscapes are not of a very high standard.\n\nThe manuscript is currently housed in the Department of Historical and Antiquarian Studies (DHAS) in Guwahati, Assam. The \"Hastividyarnava\" should not be confused with the \"Hati-Puthi\" of \"Auniati Sattra\" (Majuli), which is a much later work (possibly of the early 19th century).\n"}

There are just two known historical uses of this phrase in the Latin form \"HC SVNT DRACONES\" (i.e. \"hic sunt dracones,\" 'here are dragons'). One is on the Hunt–Lenox Globe (c. 1503–07), on which the term appeared around the east coast of Asia.

The other appearance of the term is on a globe engraved on two conjoined halves of ostrich eggs, dated to 1504. Earlier maps contain a variety of references to mythical and real creatures, but the Lenox Globe and the egg globe are the only known surviving maps to bear this phrase.

H. Schulman, starring the Jonas Brothers. The pilot was filmed in September 2008, the series premiered on Disney Channel on May 2, 2009, and became available on demand starting on April 25, 2009.\n\n\"Jonas\" is the first Disney Channel Original Series since \"Phil of the Future\" not to be shot on videotape in a multi-camera format, be filmed before a live studio audience, or use a laugh track. The series was the first on the network to premiere on a Saturday night, part of a deliberate strategy by Disney to open up the night to original programming.\n\nOn November 9, 2009, it was announced that \"Jonas\" was being picked up for a second season. On May 5, 2010, it was revealed that the name of the series was changed to \"Jonas L.A.\", reflecting the move to Los Angeles, making it the first Disney Channel sitcom to have the show's main setting change during the course of the series. The second season premiered on June 20, 2010 and ended on October 3, 2010. In November 2010, Disney Channel announced the series was canceled after two seasons.\n\nShortly after the Jonas Brothers guest starred on the \"Hannah Montana\" episode \"Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas\", development for a TV series and Disney Channel Original Movie called \"Camp Rock\" starring the Jonas Brothers began.\n\nThe original concept for the TV series was about the band playing concerts as a cover while working as government secret agents to save the world and was entitled \"Jonas\" (an acronym which stood for \"Junior Operatives Networking as Spies\"). At the same time, they tried to hide their double lives from their mother and Frankie. Meanwhile, Stella, ignorant of the Jonas' double lives, dated each of the famous brothers without informing the others and reported the details in her teen magazine column. Said Staub, \"So pretty much the entire show, it's all of us lying to each other, and kind of everything backfiring, and us getting caught in awkward situations.\" She described the concept as, \"like \"The Monkees\" and a little of bit of \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\". There's going to be fun action sequences and still be a sitcom\".\n\nThe \"Jonas\" pilot was shot in 2007, but the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike impeded progress. However, Disney Channel Asia aired it during the Sneak Peak 2008. Instead, Disney Channel filmed a mini reality show, the 2008 Disney Channel Original Short Series \"\", which followed the Jonas Brothers on a concert tour and premiered May 16. A few weeks later on June 20, 2008, the Disney Channel Original Movie \"Camp Rock\", in which the brothers starred as the fictional band \"Connect 3\", debuted. The Jonas Brothers also released \"\", a Disney Digital 3-D concert film. \"After this rush of releases, the Jonas Brothers became too popular to imagine them as anything but more dramatic versions of themselves,\" explained executive producer Michael Curtis. \"The spy concept was very big and very ambitious and it started to not feel quite right. As the band got bigger and bigger, doing a show that captured more of their real lives and trying to turn that into a more grounded, real version of what they might be doing became more interesting to do and more fun to do.\". \"It is now about us being a band and balancing a normal life,\" Nick Jonas told Access Hollywood. The title of the series changed from \"J.O.N.A.S.\" to \"JONAS\", dropping the acronym but remaining in all capitals.\n\nProducers have drawn connections between \"Jonas\" and productions by earlier bands. Show creator and producer Roger S. H. Schulman claims that \"It's hard not to make parallel comparisons to The Beatles in 1962 and 1963 when you see the kind of response that the Jonas Brothers' fans have to them,\" and describes the 1964 \"A Hard Day's Night\" and 1965 \"Help!\" as \"very much a template\" for the series. Producers and critics have also compared the series to \"The Monkees\", a popular but short-lived mid-1960s television comedy also following a real life band. At the Television Critics Association winter press tour in January 2009, Gary Marsh, entertainment president of Disney Channel Worldwide, described \"Jonas\" as a cross between \"The Monkees\" and \"Flight of the Conchords\". The \"Chicago Sun-Times\" remarks that Joe Jonas parallels \"goofy Micky Dolenz\", Kevin Jonas \"quirky Michael Nesmith\", and Nick Jonas \"dreamy Davy Jones\". The Jonas Brothers reportedly watched episodes of \"The Partridge Family\" and \"The Monkees\" \"for literally three days straight\" for inspiration.\n\n\n\nSeason 1\n\nSeason 2\n\nThe series was originally set in New Jersey, before the setting changed to Los Angeles for the second season and was shot at Hollywood Center Studios, which has also been the home to several other Disney Channel sitcoms over the years including \"The Suite Life on Deck\" and \"Wizards of Waverly Place\". As of November 2010, \"Jonas L.A.\" was the only live-action Disney Channel Original Series, produced by It's a Laugh Productions, not filmed before a live studio audience.\n\nDisney Channel has officially announced, in November 2010, that \"Jonas L.A.\" will not return. They mentioned that they will be working with the Jonas Brothers in the future.\n\nNicole Anderson also auditioned for the role of Stella, but actress Chelsea Staub ended up winning the part. According to Staub, her previous work with director Sean McNamara helped her land the role. After the series plot changed, producers decided to create a best friend for Stella and offered Anderson, Staub's real life best friend, the role of Macy.\n\n\"Jonas\" was intended to star Kevin, Nick, and Joe Jonas, who lend their first names to their television counterparts. The role of Frankie Lucas was also created with Frankie Jonas in mind. In addition, Robert \"Big Rob\" Feggans, the Jonas Brothers real-life head of security, plays The Big Man, the JONAS bodyguard.\n\nThe series originally premiered on May 22, 2009 on Disney Channel. It premiered on June 12, 2009 on Family Channel, on June 15, 2009 on Disney Channel (Australia and New Zealand) as well as on TV2 in New Zealand on April 17, 2010, on August 9, 2009 on Disney Channel (Southeast Asia), on September 11, 2009 on Disney Channel (UK and Ireland), on October 10, 2009 on Disney Channel (Europe, Middle East and Africa), an on November 30, 2009 on Disney Channel (India).\n\nThe second season originally premiered on June 20, 2010. It premiered on July 23, 2010 in Canada, on September 6, 2010 in Australia, on the same date in New Zealand and on May 31, 2012 on TV2, on October 23, 2010 in Southeast Asia, on August 13, 2010 in the UK and Ireland, and on September 18, 2010 in South Africa.\n\nOn August 23, September 6, September 20, three volumes making up the entire first season of \"JONAS\" were released on Region 2 DVD in the United Kingdom and Region 4 in Australia. The volumes include new cover arts and different titles for both volumes released in the U.S. (previously \"\"I Heart Jonas\" & \"Rockin' The House\"). The three new titles being, \"Rockstars In the House\" \"Ready To Rock\" and \"Keeping It Real\"\", with episodes released in airing order.\n\nDisney Interactive Studios released a video game based on the series for the Nintendo DS console system. It was released on November 10, 2009 in America. The game is based on many of the sets used in the TV show. The player can play as any of the brothers, play 6 concerts, and juggle school.\n\nThe game was not well received, mainly due to shoddy graphics and bad gameplay, as stated on IGN, only earning an average score of 4.0 (out of ten.)\n\nJonas is a soundtrack by the American pop rock group Jonas Brothers featured the songs from the first season of \"Jonas L.A.\". The soundtrack was never released. Only the songs from the second season were included in the official soundtrack, \"Jonas L.A.\". Some songs from the first season were never leaked or released complete.\n\n\n\"Jonas\" received mixed to negative reviews for its premiere. Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the show \"\"The Monkees\" for millennials\" and enjoyed the featured Jonas Brothers music. \"Variety\" magazine reviewer Brian Lowry believed that Jonas Brothers' adorers would be pleased with the result, and that those who are not fans would still find an amiable charm within the series. Paige Wiser of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" found the series better than \"Hannah Montana\", but commented that Nick Jonas's reserved nature made him the weak link of the premiere episode and that the boys' amateur acting is \"endearing until they play a scene opposite someone with real comedic timing – like John Ducey.\" \"The New York Times\"' John Carmanica was also disappointed with Nick's performance, particularly because, according to Carmanica, he gives off the savviest air in the band's off screen life. Carmanica also criticizes the series' script as blithe, unfunny, and \"seeded with profound cynicism\", but praised the believable fraternal interactions and Kevin Jonas's acting.\n\nThe series was the first series on Disney Channel to premiere on a Saturday night, part of a deliberate strategy by Disney to open up the night to original programming and compete with Nickelodeon's traditional dominance of the evening. The show was paired with the established series \"Wizards of Waverly Place\", which moved from a Sunday early evening timeslot, in the 8 p.m. (Eastern Time) slot. The series debuted on Disney Channel on May 2, 2009, and drew a solid 4.00 million viewers in the US, 73% of which was female. While this amounted to Disney Channel's best ratings in the time slot in eight months, it was also Disney Channel's second-lowest rated live-action series premiere in nearly four years. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" comments that \"Jonas didn't do poorly, exactly. [...] It's just that one expects the premiere of a show by a heavily promoted major Disney brand like the Jonas Brothers to make a bigger splash.\"\n\nViewership for the series second episode the following week fell sharply to nearly half its premiere audience—2.2 million total U.S. viewers and beyond cable's Top 100, which notes \"in the grand scheme of things, is still a very good showing - unless you're trying to live up to the media's expectations for a world famous act.\" E! credits the decline to the premiere of Nickelodeon's hour-long \"iCarly\" special, \"iDate a Bad Boy\", which earned 6.5 million viewers. Ratings improved over the following episodes, and the \"New York Times\" reported, \"If \"Jonas\" can dent ratings for \"iCarly\" […] the brothers’ sitcom will be considered a big success internally. However, just weeks after its premiere Disney Channel moved \"Jonas\" and \"Wizards of Waverly Place\" to Sunday and Friday evenings, respectively, and began airing movies in its old timeslot. In its Sunday timeslot, \"Jonas\" has been doing well in key kids demographics and averaging 3.4 million viewers.\n\nHowever, the move to Sundays and Fridays and declining ratings, along with the change in setting and ill-fated strategies in promoting the show would result in Disney's decision to pull the plug on \"Jonas L.A.\" On November 8, 2010, it announced that the show will not return for a third season. In a statement from a Disney Channel spokesperson: \"We've been fortunate to work with the enormously talented Jonas Brothers on several projects, including the Emmy-nominated series JONAS L.A.,\" adding that \"We look forward to working with them on new projects in the future.\"\n\n"}

The first volume (102 letters) was published in several parts between 1684 and 1686 in both Italian and in a French translation. They were translated by William Bradshaw into English in 1687 under the supervision of Robert Midgley who owned the copyright of the work. The remaining seven volumes appeared first in English between 1691 and 1694, prefaced with a letter claiming that they were translated from a discovered Italian manuscript. A French edition of the last seven volumes (with the first) was published in 1696-7 and asserting that it was a translation from the English. The eight volumes contain 644 letters.\n\nThere has long been a controversy as to the authorship of the volumes subsequent to Marana's first. They have been attributed to many writers, most notably Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw who produced the English translation. However, given the similarities between the letters, and the stylistic coherence of the whole series, the likeliest author is Marana himself. Marana may have had difficulty in getting the later volumes published in France and turned to England to secure their continuing appearance.\n\nThe work was popular throughout the 18th century and went through fifteen complete editions by 1801. Daniel Defoe was attracted to the deist rationalist sympathies of the purported spy; his \"Continuation of Turkish Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy in Paris\" (1718) extended the narrator's account from 1687 to 1693.\n\nThe volumes contain fictional letters written by one \"Mahmut the Arabian.\" The letters cover the period of 1637 to 1682 in France, from the last years of the Regency of Anne of Austria and Cardinal Richelieu through the long reign of Louis XIV and his minister Cardinal Mazarin. The Letters form a rambling journal of gossip on current politics and satire on society. Mahmut sends reports from Paris to Constantinople on politics and current events in France, but corresponds privately on other subjects including religion, and adds stories and anecdotes for diversion. His observations range from those on political figures such as Richelieu and Mazarin to speculations on the status of women, advice about state policy, and major interventions in controversies about religious doctrine and their consequences. His political position in the letters changes from that of liberal Catholic to that of a rationalistic Deist.\n\nGian Carlo Roscioni, \"Sulle tracce dell'esploratore turco\", Milano, Rizzoli, 1992\n\n"}

That part of Gothic architecture, widespread in Northern Germany, Denmark, Poland and the Baltic states, is commonly identified with the sphere of influence of the Hanseatic League. But there is a continuous mega-region of Gothic brick architecture, or Brick Gothic in a sense based on the facts, from the Strait of Dover to Finland and Lake Peipus and to the Subcarpathian region of southeastern Poland and southwestern Ukraine.\n\nOut of northern Germany and the Baltic region, the term \"Brick Gothic\" is adequately applied as well.\n\nThe region around the Baltic Sea, including Northern Germany, has some typical characteristics, but there are also regional and social differences, such as between the churches of medieval big cities and those of the neighbouring villages. On the other hand, a significant number of Gothic brick buildings erected near the Baltic Sea could also have been built in the Netherlands or in Flanders, and vice versa.\n\nFurthermore, Gothic brick structures have also been erected in other regions, such as northern Italy, southwestern and central France, and in the Danubian area of southern Germany. The particular architectural styles of some regions differ very much from the others, these are Italian Gothic (with Lombard Gothic, Venetian Gothic and Tuscan Gothic), French Gothique Méridional. Quite late began the medieval use of brick in England, with the Tudor Style.\n\nThe true extent of northern Brick Gothic and other Gothic brick architecture is shown by this almost complete list.\nThis list will never be complete. But it aims to be almost complete to give an unbiased survey as well on the variance as on the geography of Gothic brick buildings.\n\nThe dates given here refer to the present extant Gothic structures. Predecessors or post-Gothic alterations are not normally mentioned, but can be assessed by following up the literature. The most influential structures are indicated by bold print. Romanesque and Renaissance structures are not listed.

And the collective of Gothic brick buildings differs, almost no religious buildings and very few urban ones.\n\nIn the Loir-et-Cher department, there is a small group of Gothic brick buildings. One of them even is among the most famous buildings of France, though not for its bricks.\n\nIn Middles Ages, the same rulers were Dukes of Burgundy as French vassals and Counts of Burgundy as vassals of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n– Between Burgundy and Languedoc –\n\n(*) \"Our-Lady's-Assumption Church\" = \"Église Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption\"\n\n\"See List of Gothic brick buildings in Germany\"\n\n– In Hungary, there is much more hidden than visible medieval brick.

{"id": "310051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=310051", "title": "Modernisme", "text": "Modernisme\n\nModernisme (, Catalan for \"modernism\"), also known as Catalan modernism, is the historiographic denomination given to an art and literature movement associated with the search of a new entitlement of Catalan culture, one of the most predominant cultures within Spain. Nowadays it is considered a movement based on the cultural reivindication of a \"catalan identity\". Its main form of expression was in architecture, but many other arts were involved (painting, sculpture, etc.), and especially the design and the decorative arts (cabinetmaking, carpentry, forged iron, ceramic tiles, ceramics, glass-making, silver and goldsmith work, etc.), which were particularly important, especially in their role as support to architecture. Modernisme was also a literary movement (poetry, fiction, drama). \n\nAlthough Modernisme was part of a general trend that emerged in Europe around the turn of the 20th century, in Catalonia the trend acquired its own unique personality. Modernisme's distinct name comes from its special relationship, primarily with Catalonia and Barcelona, which were intensifying their local characteristics for socio-ideological reasons after the revival of Catalan culture and in the context of spectacular urban and industrial development. It is equivalent to a number of other fin de siècle art movements going by the names of Art Nouveau in France and Belgium, Jugendstil in Germany, Sezession in Austria-Hungary, Liberty style in Italy and Modern or Glasgow Style in Scotland.\n\nModernisme was active from roughly 1888 (the First Barcelona World Fair) to 1911 (the death of Joan Maragall, the most important \"Modernista\" poet). The \"Modernisme\" movement was centred in the city of Barcelona, though it reached far beyond, and is best known for its architectural expression, especially in the work of Antoni Gaudí, but was also significant in sculpture, poetry, theatre and painting. Notable painters include Santiago Rusiñol, Ramon Casas, Isidre Nonell, Hermen Anglada Camarasa, Joaquim Mir, Eliseu Meifrèn, Lluïsa Vidal and Miquel Utrillo. Notable sculptors are Josep Llimona, Eusebi Arnau and Miquel Blai.\n\nCatalan nationalism was an important influence upon \"Modernista\" artists, who were receptive to the ideas of Valentí Almirall and Enric Prat de la Riba and wanted Catalan culture to be regarded as equal to that of other European countries. Such ideas can be seen in some of Rusiñol's plays against the Spanish army (most notably \"L'Hèroe\"), in some authors close to anarchism (Jaume Brossa and Gabriel Alomar, for example) or in the articles of federalist anti-monarchic writers such as Miquel dels Sants Oliver. They also opposed the traditionalism and religiousness of the Renaixença Catalan Romantics, whom they ridiculed in plays such as Santiago Rusiñol's \"Els Jocs Florals de Canprosa\" (roughly, \"The Poetry Contest of Proseland\"), a satire of the revived Jocs Florals and the political milieu which promoted them.\n\n\"Modernistes\" largely rejected bourgeois values, which they thought to be the opposite of art. Consequently, they adopted two stances: they either set themselves apart from society in a bohemian or culturalist attitude (Decadent and Parnassian poets, Symbolist playwrights, etc.) or they attempted to use art to change society (\"Modernista\" architects and designers, playwrights inspired by Henrik Ibsen, some of Maragall's poetry, etc.)\n\nThe earliest example of \"Modernista\" architecture is the café Castell dels tres Dragons designed by Lluís Domènech i Montaner in the Parc de la Ciutadella for the 1888 Universal Exhibition. It is a search for a particular style for Catalonia drawing on Medieval and Arab styles. Like the currents known in other countries as Art Nouveau, Jugendstil, Stile Liberty, Modern Style or Sezessionstil, \"Modernisme\" was closely related to the English Arts and Crafts movement and the Gothic revival. As well as combining a rich variety of historically-derived elements, it is characterized by the predominance of the curve over the straight line, by rich decoration and detail, by the frequent use of vegetal and other organic motifs, the taste for asymmetry, a refined aestheticism and dynamic shapes. While Barcelona was the centre of \"Modernista\" construction, the Catalan industrial bourgeoisie built industrial buildings and summer residences - \"cases d'estiueig\" - in many Catalan towns, notably Terrassa and Reus. The textile factory which is now home to the Catalan national technical museum MNACTEC is an outstanding example.\nAntoni Gaudí is the best-known architect of this movement. Other influential architects were Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and later Josep Maria Jujol, Rafael Guastavino and Enrique Nieto.\n\nIn literature, \"Modernisme\" stood out the most in narrative. The \"nouvelles\" and novels of decadent writers such as Prudenci Bertrana (whose highly controversial \"Josafat\" involved a demented priest who ends up killing a prostitute), Caterina Albert (also known as Víctor Catala), author of bloody, expressionistic tales of rural violence, opposed to the idealisation of nature propugned by Catalan Romantics, or Raimon Casellas have been highly influential upon later Catalan narrative, essentially recovering a genre that had been lost due to political causes since the end of the Middle Ages. Those writers often, though not always, show influences from Russian literature of the 19th Century and also Gothic novels. Still, works not influenced by those sources, such as Joaquim Ruyra's slice-of-life tales of the North-Eastern Catalan coast are perhaps even more influential than that of the aforementioned authors, and Rusiñol's well-known \"L'auca del senyor Esteve\" (roughly \"The Tale of Mr. Esteve\"; an \"auca\" is a type of illustrated broadside, similar to a one-sheet comic book) is an ironic critique of Catalan bourgeoisie more related to ironic, pre-Realist Catalan \"costumisme\".\n\nIn poetry, \"Modernisme\" closely follows Symbolist and Parnassian poetry, with poets frequently crossing the line between both tendencies or alternating between them. Another important strain of \"Modernista\" poetry is Joan Maragall's \"Paraula viva\" (\"Living word\") school, which advocated Nietzschean vitalism and spontaneous and imperfect writing over cold and thought-over poetry. Although poetry was very popular with the \"Modernistes\" and there were lots of poets involved in the movement, Maragall is the only \"Modernista\" poet who is still widely read today.\n\n\"Modernista\" theatre was also important, as it smashed the insubstantial regional plays that were popular in 19th century Catalonia. There were two main schools of \"Modernista\" theatre: social theatre, which intended to change society and denounce injustice—the worker stories of Ignasi Iglésias, for example \"Els Vells\" (\"The old ones\"); the Ibsen-inspired works of Joan Puig i Ferreter, most notably \"Aigües Encantades\" (\"Enchanted Waters\"); Rusiñol's antimilitaristic play \"L'Hèroe\"—and symbolist theatre, which emphasised the distance between artists and the bourgeoisie—for example, Rusiñol's \"Cigales i Formigues\" (\"Cicadas and Ants\") or \"El Jardí Abandonat\" (\"The Abandoned Garden\").\n\n\"Modernista\" ideas impelled \"L'Avenç\" collaborator Pompeu Fabra to devise a new orthography for Catalan. However, only with the later rise of Noucentisme did his projects come to fruition and end the orthographic chaos which reigned at the time.\n\nBy 1910, \"Modernisme\" had been accepted by the bourgeoisie and had pretty much turned into a fad. It was around this time that Noucentista artists started to ridicule the rebel ideas of \"Modernisme\" and propelled a more bourgeois art and a more right-of-center version of Catalan Nationalism, which eventually rose to power with the victory of the Lliga Regionalista in 1912. Until Miguel Primo de Rivera's dictatorship suppressed all substantial public use of Catalan, Noucentisme was immensely popular in Catalonia. However, \"Modernisme\" did have a revival of sorts during the Second Spanish Republic, with \"avant-garde\" writers such as Futurist Joan-Salvat Papasseit earning comparisons to Joan Maragall, and the spirit of Surrealists such as Josep Vicent Foix or Salvador Dalí being clearly similar to the rebellion of the \"Modernistes\", what with Dalí proclaiming that Catalan Romanticist Àngel Guimerà was \"a putrefact pervert\". However, the ties between Catalan art from the 1930s and \"Modernisme\" are not that clear, as said artists were not consciously attempting to continue any tradition.\n\n\"Modernista\" architecture survived longer. The Spanish city of Melilla in Northern Africa experienced an economic boom at the turn of the 20th century, and its new bourgeoisie showed its riches by massively ordering \"Modernista\" buildings. The workshops established there by Catalan architect Enrique Nieto continued producing decorations in this style even when it was out of fashion in Barcelona, which results in Melilla having, oddly enough, the second largest concentration of \"Modernista\" works after Barcelona.\n\nSome of the works of Catalan Modernism have been listed by UNESCO as World Cultural Heritage:\n\nThere were more than 100 architects who made buildings of the \"Modernista\" style, three of whom are particularly well known for their outstanding buildings: Antoni Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a colour lithograph from 1891, probably printed in about 3,000 copies, advertising the famous dancers La Goulue and \"No-Bones\" Valentin, and the new Paris dance hall Moulin Rouge. Although most examples were pasted as advertising posters and lost, surviving examples are in the collection of the Indianapolis Museum of Art and many other institutions.\n\n\"Moulin Rouge: La Goulue\" is a bold, four-color lithograph depicting the famous cancan dancer La Goulue and her flexible partner Valentine le désossé made to advertise the popular French club, Moulin Rouge. Their audience is reduced to silhouettes in order to focus attention on the performers and evoke the Japanese art then in vogue. The triple repetition of the club's name draws the focus down to the central figure of the poster, La Goulue herself. The stark white of her petticoats, depicted with just a few lines on the white paper, epitomizes Toulouse-Lautrec's boldly simplistic style, a sharp break from the text-heavy posters of the day.\n\nThe Moulin Rouge had opened two years earlier, in 1889, and instantly established itself as a Montmartre landmark. It was renowned for the elasticity of its young dancers, both physically and morally; police officers made periodic checks to ensure that they were all wearing underwear. However, the poster by Jules Chéret advertising the club's delights, was relatively subdued, so the director Charles Zidler hired the young (only 27 years old) Toulouse-Lautrec to create a more vibrant poster.\n\nAlthough \"Moulin Rouge: La Goulue\" was Toulouse-Lautrec's first attempt at lithography, such was his grasp of the medium's possibilities that it was an immediate sensation. 3000 copies spread around Paris captivated the public with their eye-catching design, bold colors, and innovative, Japanese-inspired use of silhouettes. Cannily focusing on the dancer La Goulue, whose energetic kicks and insatiable appetites had made her famous, gave the poster an additional boost in popularity. However, it was Toulouse-Lautrec's own artistic skill that made him a star overnight.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the best known works of Celtic art from Iron Age Europe, and, along with the Glauberg \"Prince\" and the \nWarrior of Hirschlanden, one of the few large representations of the human figure. Ever since its discovery in 1943, the sculpture became one of the most photographed, reproduced and published La Tène (cc. 450-50 B.C.) objects ever. The sculpture is now in the Prague National Museum as inventory No. 111938.\n\nWith its iconic moustache, owl-like eyes, torc ornament and unique hairstyle, the marlstone head became an international mascot of 'barbarian' Europe, embellishing the covers of many scientific as well as populist publications concentrating on Iron Age Europe related issues.\n\nThe stone head, sculpted from local Cretaceous limestone has a maximum height of 234mm and width of 174mm. The sculpture was broken into at least five pieces sometime in antiquity. Four pieces have been found in fairly good condition. However, the missing fragment or possibly fragments, a right-hand side of the head including upper part of the ear, have not yet been found. The heavily stylized facial features are projected on an almost flat surface surrounded by a braid-like shaped hair. The most prominent are the bulging oval eyes, contoured by a curvilinear eyebrow matching a similarly imposing curvilinear moustache. The mouth is suggested by a mere downward bending line. The ears are not naturalistic but rather represented as lotus buds, a stylistic form representative of La Tène art. The neck is formed in a shape of a torc, a traditional Celtic necklace. A similar torc can be seen on the second-century B.C. sculpture of a \"Dying Gaul\" from Pergamon.\n\nThe visual imagery of the La Tène period was characterized by an ubiquitous appearance of an anthropomorphic head symbol typical of Central and Western Celtic Europe These images were skillfully entwined in ornaments, handles, jewelry and reliefs fashioned mostly of metals. Anthropomorphic sculpture itself was extraordinarily rare and few examples survive till today. The \"Celtic Hero\" was found during a course of 1943 excavation of oppidum Mšecké Žehrovice in central Bohemia, Czech Republic. The sculpture was buried in a pit on a southwest corner of a square enclosure located within the oppidum. Other artifacts found in the pit include burned animal bones that date the feature to late La Tène period LT C2-D1 (approx. 150-50 BC.), pottery sherds, pieces of saprolite and a piece of iron wire. The dating of the pit is further supported by the typology of the pottery sherds which also place the interment of the sculpture to approx. mid 2nd to mid 1st century BC.\n"}
{"id": "1682480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1682480", "title": "Ormolu", "text": "Ormolu\n\nOrmolu (from French \"or moulu\", signifying ground or pounded gold) is an English term, used since the 18th century for the gilding technique of applying finely ground, high-carat gold–mercury amalgam to an object of bronze, and for objects finished in this way.\n\nThe mercury is driven off in a kiln leaving behind a gold coating. The French refer to this technique as \"bronze doré\"; in English, it is known as \"gilt bronze\".\n\nThe manufacture of true ormolu employs a process known as mercury-gilding or fire-gilding, in which a solution of mercuric nitrate is applied to a piece of copper, brass, or bronze; followed by the application of an amalgam of gold and mercury. The item is then exposed to extreme heat until the mercury vaporizes and the gold remains, adhering to the metal object.\n\nThis process has generally been supplanted by the electroplating of gold over a nickel substrate, which is more economical and less dangerous.\n\nDue to exposure to the harmful mercury fumes, most gilders did not survive beyond 40 years of age. In literature there is a reference from John Webster:\n\nAfter around 1830, legislation in France had outlawed the use of mercury, although it continued to be commonly employed until around 1900 and was still in use around 1960 in very few workshops. To replace ormolu, other gilding techniques (like electroplating from the mid-19th century on) were utilized. Electroplating is the most common modern technique. Ormolu techniques are essentially the same as those used on silver, to produce silver-gilt (also known as vermeil).\n\nA later substitute of a mixture of metals resembling ormolu was developed in France and called \"pomponne\", though the mix of copper and zinc, sometimes with an addition of tin, is technically a type of brass. From the 19th century the term has been popularized to refer to gilt metal or imitation gold.\n\nGilt-bronze is found from antiquity onwards across Eurasia, and especially in Chinese art, where it was always more common than silver-gilt, the opposite of Europe.\n\nCraftsmen principally used ormolu for the decorative mountings of furniture, clocks, lighting devices, and porcelain. The great French furniture designers and cabinetmakers, or \"ébénistes\", of the 18th and 19th centuries made maximum use of the exquisite gilt-bronze mounts produced by \"fondeurs-ciseleurs\" (founders and finishers) such as the renowned Jacques Caffieri (1678–1755), whose finished gilt-bronze pieces were almost as fine as jewelers' work. Ormolu mountings attained their highest artistic and technical development in France.\n\nSimilarly fine results could be achieved for lighting devices, such as chandeliers and candelabras, as well as for the ornamental metal mounts applied to clock cases and to ceramic pieces. In the hands of the Parisian \"marchands-merciers\", the precursors of decorators, ormolu or gilt-bronze sculptures were used for bright, non-oxidizing fireplace accessories or for Rococo or Neoclassical mantel-clocks or wall-mounted clock-cases – a specialty of Charles Cressent (1685–1768) – complemented by rock-crystal drops on gilt-bronze chandeliers and wall-lights.\n\nThe bronze mounts were cast by lost wax casting, and then chiseled and chased to add detail. Rococo gilt bronze tends to be finely cast, lightly chiseled, and part-burnished. Neoclassical gilt-bronze is often entirely chiseled and chased with extraordinary skill and delicacy to create finely varied surfaces.\n\nThe ormolu technique was extensively used in the French Empire mantel clocks, reaching its peak during this period.\n\nChinese and European porcelains mounted in gilt-bronze were luxury wares that heightened the impact of often-costly and ornamental ceramic pieces sometimes used for display. Chinese ceramics with gilt-bronze mounts were produced under the guidance of the Parisian \"marchands-merciers\", for only they had access to the ceramics (often purchased in the Netherlands) and the ability to overleap the guild restrictions. A few surviving pieces of 16th-century Chinese porcelain subsequently mounted in contemporary European silver-gilt, or \"vermeil\", show where the foundations of the later fashion lay.\n\nFrom the late 1760s, Matthew Boulton (1728–1809) of Birmingham produced English ormolu vases and perfume-burners in the latest Neoclassical style. Though the venture never became a financial success, it produced the finest English ormolu. In the early 19th century fine English ormolu came from the workshops of Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy (1780–1854).\n\nIn France, the tradition of neoclassic ormolu to Pierre-Philippe Thomire (1751–1843) was continued by Lucien-François Feuchère. Beurdeley & Cie. produced excellent ormolu in Rococo and Neoclassical styles in Paris, and rococo gilt-bronze is characteristic of the furniture of François Linke.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the legal recognition that the defense of cultural objects is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military purposes, and the protection of culture always has precedence over any military necessity.\n\nRussian painter and philosopher Nicholas Roerich (1874–1947) initiated the modern movement for the defense of cultural objects, for the idea of \"Peace of Civilizations\". Besides the recognition as one of the greatest Russian painters, Roerich's most notable achievement during his lifetime was the Roerich Pact signed on 15 April 1935 by the representatives of American states in the Oval Office of the White House (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.\n\nNicholas Roerich was born on 9 October 9, 1874, in St. Petersburg. His parents encouraged him to study law, but seeing their son's inclination for painting, they allowed him to study both, which he did with much success. In 1900, Roerich went to Paris to take lessons from Fernand Cormon, the well known tutor of Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec. Upon his return to St. Petersburg, he married Helena Shaposhnikova, who later developed the Agni Yoga philosophy. Soon Roerich became quite a successful painter. One of his paintings was purchased by Russian Tsar Nicolas II himself. Roerich also worked as stage and costume designer for several operas and ballets by Maurice Maeterlinck and Igor Stravinsky, premiered in St. Petersburg.\n\nIn 1917 Roerich went to live near a lake in Finland, to strengthen his health. After the border between Russia and Finland was closed in 1918 in the context of the October Revolution and Finnish Civil War, the family travelled across several Scandinavian countries to Great Britain and eventually left for North America in 1920. There, Roerich founded two cultural institutions: \"Cor Ardens\" (Flaming Heart, a fraternity of artists from several countries) and \"The Master Institute of United Arts\" (an organization for education, science, and philosophy).\n\nIn 1923, the Roerich Museum was founded in New York. In 1929, it moved to a new building. Presently, the Roerich Museum is located in Manhattan, at the corner of 107th Street and Riverside Drive. In 1929, Roerich's work towards the pact was recognised through a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.\nAfter leaving America, the Roerichs settled at Naggar in the Kullu Valley from which their estate looked towards the Himalayas. Here they established the Urusvati Institute which remains in Naggar with an exhibition about the pact. Nicholas Roerich died of a cardiac arrest on 13 December 1947.\n\nAn idea about the protection of cultural monuments was formulated for the first time by N.K. Roerich in 1899. During his excavations at Saint-Petersburg province, Roerich began to point to the necessity of protection of cultural monuments, which reproduce a world-view of ancient people for us.\n\nIn 1903, Roerich together with his wife Helena Ivanovna Roerich toured through forty ancient Russian cities, including Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Vladimir, Suzdal, Yuriev-Polsky, Smolensk, Vilnius, Izborsk and Pskov. In 1904, proceeding the expedition, N.K.Roerich has visited Uglich, Kalyazin, Kashin and Tver. During these travels Roerich created a large series of architectural studies, created near 90 paintings of the visited sites. Later many Russian churches were destroyed and these paintings remain the only documenting images.\n\nSummarizing this trips, the painter admired the beauty of the ancient monuments. Roerich, expressing his feelings for the state of their protection, in his article \"Along the old times\" (1903): \"Last summer I had an occasion to see many our true antique and little love to it\".\n\nIn 1904, Roerich gave a report to the Emperor's Russian Archeologist Society about the sad state of historical monuments and the necessity to take prompt actions to protect them.\n\nDuring the Russian-Japan war (1904–1905), Roerich expressed an idea about the necessity of a special treaty for the protection of institutions and cultural monuments. In the course of several years after his travel in 1903-1904, Roerich repeatedly pointed out the state of antique monuments. He wrote several articles dedicated to the poor state of the churches. In the article \"Silent Pogroms\" (1911) Roerich wrote about the unskillful restoration of St. John the Forerunner Church at Yaroslavl: \"Who would defense a beautiful antique from mad pogroms? It is grievously when the antique dies. But it is more terrible when the antique remains disfigured, false, imitation...\".\n\nIn 1914, Roerich appealed to the high command of the Imperial Russian army, as well as the governments of the United States and France with an idea of conclusion of an international agreement aimed on the protection of cultural values during armed conflicts. He created a poster \"Enemy of Mankind\" denouncing the barbaric destruction of cultural monuments, and picture \"Glow\" expressing a protest against World War I.\n\nIn 1915, Roerich wrote a report for Russian Emperor Nicholas II and Great Prince Nicholas Nikolayevich containing an appeal to make real state measures for national protection of cultural values.\n\nIn 1929, Roerich, in cooperation with G.G. Shklyaver (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver), a doctor of international law and political sciences at Paris University prepared a project of the Pact for protection of cultural values. Simultaneously Roerich proposed a distinctive sign to identify the objects that are in need of protection – the Banner of Peace. It represents a white cloth with a red circle and three red circles inscribed in it.\n\nIn 1929 Roerich in collaboration with Paris University professor G.G. Shklyaver (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver) prepared a draft of an international treaty dedicated to protection of cultural values. The scheme was to be a cultural analog to the Red Cross for medical neutrality.\n\nIn 1930, text of draft agreement with accompanying Roerich's appeal to governments and peoples of all countries was published in press and distributed in government, scientific, artistic and educational institutions of the whole world. As a result, the committees supporting the Pact were established in many countries. The draft pact was approved by Committee for Museum affairs at League of Nations and also by the Committee of the Pan-American Union. Ultimately, the Pact was signed by 21 states in the Americas and was ratified by ten of them.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the Roerich Pact played an important role in forming of international law standards and public activity in the field of protection of cultural heritage. In 1949, at the fourth UNESCO General Conference, a decision was accepted to begin the work for international law regulation in the field of cultural heritage protection in case of armed conflict.\n\nIdeas of Roerich Pact still are not implemented in the international law, especially its principle of the almost unlimited preference of the preservation of cultural values to the military necessity.\n\n1930 – A project together with N. Roerich's covering appeal to governments and peoples of all the countries was published and communicated to the governments, scientific, artistic and educational institutions of the world.\n\n1931 – An International Union of the Roerich Pact was founded at Bruges under the guidance of a member of Belgium Committee for monument protection .\n\n1932, 7–9 September - second International conference dedicated to the Roerich Pact had been organized at Bruges. Twenty two countries took part in its work. The Conference has resolved to found at Bruges a special institute for world assistance to implementation of the Roerich Pact ideas in public life. It also took a decision to appeal to all the countries to recognize the Pact as international treaty.\n\n1933, 15 November – Organizing Committee of third international Conference dedicated to the Roerich Pact visited the USA President F. Roosevelt.\n\n1934, 4 April – A report of special committee of Pan-American Union dedicated to Roerich Pact was approved.\n\n1935, 15 April – A Treaty named \"international pact for protection of artistic and scientific institutions, historic monuments, missions and collections\" (Roerich Pact) is concluded and signed by representatives of 21 American states at the White House, Washington. A distinctive sign for identification of the protected objects (Banner of Peace) proposed by Roerich was approved in the frameworks of the Pact.\n\nPresident F. Roosevelt talked in his radio speech:\n\"Presenting this Pact for signing by all the countries, we strive for that its world acceptance becomes a vital principle for preserving of modern civilization. This agreement has more profound significance than the text of this document\" [1].\n\n1937, October – First Congress of Baltic Roerich societies has resolved to create the committees of Roerich Pact in all Roerich societies of Baltic countries.\n\n1938, 17 November – the Banner of Peace was spread out in Karachi (India).\n\n1942 – The American-Russian culture association (ARCA) was formed in New York. Ernest Hemingway, Charlie Chaplin, Rockwell Kent, Norman Bel Geddes, Edmund Cooper, Serge Koussevitzky, Valeriy Ivanovich Tereshchenko were its active contributors. The association's activity was welcomed by world-known scientists Robert Andrews Millikan and Arthur Compton.\n\n1946, 23 January – first meeting of resumed New York Committee of the Pact and Banner of Peace has been conducted.\n\n1948, August – Indian government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru has decided to approve the Roerich Pact.\n\n1948-1949 – Italian association of Roerich Pact at Bologna has organized the work to support the Pact on a broad footing. Committees of the Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace worked in Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, France, England, Portugal, Brazil, Columbia, Uruguay, Bolivia and Cuba.\n\n1949 – 4th UNESCO general conference has taken a decision to begin a work for international-law regulation in the field of cultural values protection during the military actions.\n\n1950 – A New York Committee of the Roerich Pact has transferred all the documentation about the Pact to UNESCO. 5th session of general UNESCO conference entrusted the general director with preparation and sending of a draft of convention. Special committee of UNESCO has prepared the draft of international convention in view of given documents.\n\n1954, 14 May –U.N.O and UNESCO Conference in Hague has accepted the \"Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict\" and a protocol accompanying it. The Second protocol to the Hague convention was accepted in March 1999 due to initiative and close participation of UNESCO. A text of the Hague convention pointed directly on that the base for it acceptance is a principle of cultural values protection during the war established at the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and also in the Roerich Pact. This Hague convention was signed by representatives from 37 countries.\n\n1970, 14 November – \"UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property\" was accepted at 16th session of general UNESCO conference in Paris.\n\n1972, 23 November – \"Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage\" was accepted at 17th session of general UNESCO conference in Paris.\n\n1974 – Alpinists from Novosibirsk hoisted the Banner of Peace on the Roerich peak near Belukha Mountain (Altai).\n\n1988, 6 May – Banner of Peace was hoisted at North Pole.\n\n1990, 11 February – Soviet cosmonauts Aleksandr Balandin and Anatoly Solovyev took the Banner of Peace on the board of orbital station \"Mir\".\n\n1995, 26 June – Banner of Peace was presented to Gebhardt von Moltke, deputy of secretary for political questions at NATO headquarters in Brussels.\n\n1997 – Banner of Peace was given to the crew of Soviet orbital station \"Soyuz-TM\" in the frameworks of scientific-enlightener project \"Banner of Peace\". It was delivered to orbital station \"Mir\" and remains in cosmos during two years (August 5, 1997 – August 28, 1999), accompanying the work of international crews.\n\n1998, 9 October – Banner of Peace was hoisted over the Centre-Museum named after N. Roerich in Moscow.\n\n1999, 5 January – Banner of Peace was presented to President of Kazakhstan Republic Nursultan Nazarbayev at President Palace (Almaty). Cosmonaut Alexey Leonov and Professor Sergey Kapitsa took part in the ceremony.\n- 26 March – Second protocol to \"Convention for protection of cultural values in case of armed conflict\" (Hague, 1954) was signed in Hague. The document was written by six languages: English, Arabic, Spanish, Chinese, Russian and French.\n\n2000, 8 January – Banner of Peace was established at Southern Pole.\n\n2003, 17 October – The Convention about protection of non-material cultural heritage was accepted by 32nd session of the General UNESCO conference.\n\n2004, 25 October – Banner of Peace from the board of cosmic station \"Mir\" was presented to Speaker of Indian Parliament Sri Somnath Chatterjee on the occasion of 100th Sviatoslav Roerich's Anniversary.\n\n\"Pax Cultura\" (\"Cultural Peace\" or \"Peace through Culture\") is the motto of the cultural artifact protection movement founded by Nicholas Roerich, and is symbolized by a maroon on white emblem consisting of three solid circles in a surrounding circle. On April 15, 1935 the Roerich Pact was signed by the United States and Latin American nations, agreeing that \"historic monuments, museums, scientific, artistic, educational and cultural institutions\" should be protected both in times of peace and war, and identified by their flying a distinctive flag, the \"Banner of Peace\", bearing the Pax Cultura emblem.\n\nAccording to the Roerich Museum, \"The Banner of Peace symbol has ancient origins. Perhaps its earliest known example appears on Stone Age amulets: three dots, without the enclosing circle. Roerich came across numerous later examples in various parts of the world, and knew that it represented a deep and sophisticated understanding of the triune nature of existence. But for the purposes of the Banner and the Pact, Roerich described the circle as representing the totality of culture, with the three dots being Art, Science, and Religion, three of the most embracing of human cultural activities. He also described the circle as representing the eternity of time, encompassing the past, present, and future. The sacred origins of the symbol, as an illustration of the trinities fundamental to all religions, remain central to the meaning of the Pact and the Banner today.\"\n\nThe Roerich Pact sign was superseded by the distinctive marking of cultural property as defined by the Hague Convention of 1954. However, the emblem of the Roerich Pact is still a valid protective sign in the relations between the ten states which are bound by the Pact.\n\nThe Roerich Pact is not only a relatively short multilateral treaty: it is a conglomerate of legal ideas about a new state order in which the state and the culture closely overlap. A measure of this complexity is the share of state budget annually spent on culture, art and\neducation, which in many countries exceeds military expenses.\n\nImportant in the framework of ideas of the Roerich Pact is the recognition that the safety of any foreign cultural object on the territory of a foreign state must be also respected and treated as a factor much higher in significance than military willingness to bomb, destroy or use it for military purposes.\n\nNicholas Roerich managed to continue and develop into a profound and feasible doctrine the famous maxim proclaimed by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, \"Beauty will save the World!\" Hence starts a very powerful Russian movement in the development of the concept of aesthetical statehood. The concept of the state as a work of art was first suggested in the 19th century by Jacob Burckhardt, who was Swiss historian of art, specializing in Italian Renaissance, and who gave this name to a chapter of one of his books. The concept itself had not been formulated to a completion and was expressed in a general idea that period, as well as their rulers, considered the achievements in culture and art as most important for securing the prestige both of their states and their own, which finally resulted in the unique Italian Renaissance art, literature, philosophy and science. Roerich produced ideas based on the approaches used by Burkhardt and Dostoevsky.\n\nRoerich, considered the care for future generations to be a cornerstone of the existence of the rule of law and the constitutional state. President of the USA, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the speech upon the signature of the 'Roerich Pact' Treaty said: \"In opening this Pact to the adherence of the Nations of the world, we are endeavoring to make of universal application one of the principles vital to the preservation of modern civilization. This Treaty possesses a spiritual significance far deeper than the text of the instrument itself. It is important to realize that the Roerich Pact was only the first step towards the future development of a new legal culture. All written laws must conform to the universal unwritten principles of morality, fairness, and justice, equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect that is known as a higher law theory. The concrete conceptual provisions of Roerich's philosophical and legal concept of the state are based on the one of Rule According to Higher Law ideas that the primary duty of the state is to sustain and develop the spiritual unity of its citizens, by carefully preserving the best specimens of national cultural heritage, promoting universal culture and spiritual growth of all people, especially the young ones. At that, the major share of profits received by the state should be directed at the development of culture, which, as it was already mentioned, would lead to a further growth of economical prosperity.\n\nAccording to Roerich's concept, the state, as an instrument for the preservation and development of culture, the instrument defending both domestic and foreign cultural treasures, the instrument maintaining peace and avoiding wars, the instrument building a new civilization, based on the best cultural traditions of today and, therefore, spending the utmost economically reasonable assets for these purposes — all this can be explicitly and exclusively based on constitutional foundation.\n\nIn the broad sense the Roerich Pact is understood as not only a legal treaty but also as a whole complex of measures for the protection of cultural values suggested by N. Roerich. Consequently, the Roerich Pact has not only legal but also philosophic, enlightening, and evolutional significance since it reflects an idea of cultural protection in its many manifestations.\n\nCharacterizing the Roerich Pact, cosmonaut A.A. Leonov wrote:\n\nIf we are raising a culture and spirituality then it will help us to strengthen an economics, to make the policy moral and to stop the military conflicts. This is a significance of the Roerich Pact today. The more time is passed the more actual for the world it becomes. …\n\nDeveloping the Pact ideas N. Roerich has stated the thoughts about a role of community. The laws for culture protection in itself will not work if the community will not display an activity and interest to this. Later this thought was supported by academician D.S. Likhachev. He said:\n\n… I believe that the best and freely developing social forms of culture can unite creative constructive forces and improve a social life, thereby help the state to maintain high ideals of humanism and peacefulness in the people. …\n\nAt the first international conference of Roerich Pact in Bruges (September, 1931), N. Roerich proposed to create a World League of Culture. One of main aims of the League must be to train care of the nature.\n\nIn his article \"Pain of the Planet\" (1933) N. Roerich wrote: \"The call about culture, call about the world, and call about creativity and beauty reaches the ear which is strengthen by true values only. Understanding of life as self-improving for the people's good arises where the respect of the nature is valid. Therefore, the League of Culture together with main enlightener activity must wholesale explain a wise regard for the nature as an origin of merry work, wise joy, continuous cognition and creativity\".\n\nThe cultural community highly appreciates N. Roerich's thought about the implementation of World Day of Culture. N. Roerich wrote:\n\"… We shall hear about the world Day of Culture too when at all schools and enlightener societies simultaneously the day will dedicated to comprehension of the national and world cultural treasures…\"\n\n"}

The first issue appeared with a cover date of September–October 1955 and featured three psychology-themed stories, similar in theme to the comic \"Psychoanalysis\" published by EC in 1955. Starting with the second issue this type of story was generally reduced to one per issue, with the remaining stories being similar in theme to those that appeared in EC's comic \"Shock SuspenStories\".\n\n\"Shock Illustrated\" ran for a total of three issues. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and when EC's distributor went bankrupt, the company had no choice but to cancel the prints. The third issue of this magazine is known as the rarest EC publication of all time. Although all 250,000 copies had been printed, publisher Bill Gaines lacked the funds to bind them, and all but 100 copies were destroyed.\n\nThe editor of \"Shock Illustrated\" was Al Feldstein. In addition to those stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote under the pseudonym Alfred E. Neuman. Feldstein included multiple retellings of previous stories, a move suggested by Gaines.

{"id": "20734598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20734598", "title": "Short story cycle", "text": "Short story cycle\n\nA short story cycle (sometimes referred to as a story sequence or composite novel) is a collection of short stories in which the narratives are specifically composed and arranged with the goal of creating an enhanced or different experience when reading the group as a whole as opposed to its individual parts. Short story cycles are different from novels because the parts that would make up the chapters can all stand alone as a short story, each individually containing a beginning, middle and conclusion. When read as a group there is a tension created between the ideas of the individual stories, often showing changes that have occurred over time or highlighting the conflict between two opposing concepts or thoughts. Because of this dynamic, the stories need to have an awareness of what the other stories accomplish; therefore, cycles are usually written with the expressed purpose to create a cycle as opposed to being gathered and arranged later.\n\nScholars have pointed out that there is a wide range of possibilities that fall between simple collections and novels in their most-commonly understood form. One question is how well the stories stand up individually: chapters of a novel usually cannot stand alone, whereas stories in collections are meant to be fully independent. But many books have combined stories in such a way that the stories have varying degrees of interdependence, and it is these variations that cause problems in definition. Maggie Dunn and Ann Morris, for instance, claim that the stories in a \"story cycle\" are more independent than those in a \"composite novel\", and James Nagel points out that both \"cycle\" and \"sequence\" are misleading, since \"cycle\" implies circularity and \"sequence\" implies temporal linearity, neither of which he finds to be essential to most such collections. Rolf Lundén has suggested four types of cycles, in order of decreasing unity: the \"cycle\", in which the ending resolves the conflicts brought up at the beginning (e.g., \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\"); the \"sequence\", in which each story is linked to the ones before it but without a cumulative story that ties everything together (e.g., \"The Unvanquished\"); the \"cluster\", in which the links between stories are not always made obvious and in which the discontinuity between them is more significant than their unity (e.g., \"Go Down, Moses\"); and the \"novella\", in the classical sense of a collection of unrelated stories brought together by a frame story and a narrator(s) (e.g., \"Winesburg, Ohio\").[All examples are Lundén's] Robert M. Luscher compares and contrasts the short story cycle and science fiction short stories combined into longer fixups.\n\nIn their study of the genre, Maggie Dunn and Ann Morris note that the form descends from two different traditions: There are texts that are themselves assembled from other texts, such as the way the tales from the Arthurian cycle is compiled in books by Chretien de Troyes, Wolfram von Eschenbach, Thomas Malory and the \"Mabinogion\". Then there are the classic serialized novellas, many of them with frame stories; this genre includes \"One Thousand and One Nights\", \"The Decameron\", \"The Canterbury Tales\", etc. Dunn and Morris show how in the nineteenth century, the genre appeared in such forms as the village sketch collection (e.g., \"Our Village\") and the patchwork collection (e.g., Louisa May Alcott's \"Aunt Jo's Scrap-Bag\").\n\nJ. Gerald Kennedy describes the proliferation of the genre in the twentieth century, attributing it in part to the desire \"to renounce the organizing authority of an omniscient narrator, asserting instead a variety of voices or perspectives reflective of the radical subjectivity of modern experience. Kennedy finds this proliferation in keeping with modernism and its use of fragmentation, juxtaposition and simultaneism to reflect what the \"multiplicity\" that characterizes the century. Scholars such as James Nagel and Rocío G. Davis have pointed out that the story cycle has been very popular among ethnic U.S. authors. Davis argues that ethnic writers find the format useful \"as a metaphor for the fragmentation and multiplicity of ethnic lives\" insofar as it highights \"the subjectivity of experience and understanding\" by allowing \"multiple impressionistic perspectives and fragmentation of simple linear history\".\n\nDunn and Morris list several methods that authors use to provide unity to the collection as a whole. It has to be noted that these organising principles pertain to their theory of the composite novel as a short story collection where the focus lies on the coherent whole. (the examples are theirs):\nThe organising principles\nMultiple of these organizing principles may be used in order to create a composite novel.\n\n"}

The first episode aired on January 18, 2015 on Disney Channel and became the most-watched animated series debut in Disney XD’s history. The fourth season is to premiere in 2019.\n\nStar Butterfly is a magical princess from the dimension of Mewni, and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. As per tradition, she is given the family heirloom wand on her 14th birthday. After she accidentally sets fire to the family castle, her parents King River and Queen Moon Butterfly decide that a safer option is to send her to Earth as a foreign exchange student, so she can continue her magic training there. She befriends Marco Diaz and lives with his family while attending Echo Creek Academy. Going in a series of misadventures using \"dimensional scissors\" that can open portals, Star and Marco must deal with everyday school life while protecting Star's wand from falling into the hands of Ludo, a villain from Mewni who commands a group of monsters. Besides also dealing with her ex-boyfriend Tom, in Season 3, Star goes up against more serious villains like Toffee and Meteora Butterfly while uncovering the mystery behind her relative Eclipsa Butterfly.\n\nNefcy said she originally created Star as a girl who wanted to be a magical girl like \"Sailor Moon\", and Marco as a boy who was obsessed with \"Dragon Ball Z\" and karate; they would be enemies instead of friends. In this earlier version, Star did not have any actual magical powers; she instead would approach and solve problems primarily through the force of her determination alone. Nefcy began pitching the show when she was in her third year of college, when Cartoon Network was actively soliciting the creation of pilots for prospective new shows. Nefcy originally placed Star in the fourth grade, reflecting on a time in her own childhood when she held a self-described obsession with the animated series \"Sailor Moon\". However, Nefcy later adjusted the character's age to fourteen during the time she made her series proposition to Disney. An executive at that time made the suggestion for Star to have actual magical powers. Nefcy worked this concept into the show's current iteration, along with the idea of different dimensions as show locations, the framing device of Star being a foreign exchange student, and the plot aspects relating to Star being a princess and the subsequent consequences of her royal birthright. Nefcy said that the overall concept has evolved over about six years.\n\nIn addition to \"Sailor Moon\" and \"Dragon Ball Z\", Nefcy has said that she had heavy influence in her youth from the animated Japanese shows \"Magic Knight Rayearth\", \"Revolutionary Girl Utena\" and \"Unico\", the last of which featured a pink unicorn. She also cited shows unrelated to Japanese animation such as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", and was influenced by independent comic series such as \"Scott Pilgrim\" and \"The Dungeon\". With regards to the development of more strong female characters, Nefcy said that she \"looked at TV over the years and I have had to go to Japan when I was younger to find the cartoons that had the characters that I wanted to see. It was always a question of 'Well, why isn't that on TV in the U.S.?'\"\n\nOne of the concepts she likes about the show is that it doesn't make high school the most important experience for teenagers. She also likes that Star does her own thing instead of being concerned about fitting in. Nefcy did not want the gimmick about keeping the magic powers a secret from others as typical of magical girl shows, so she had the students already know about it and Marco's parents as well. She also portrays Star as not really a superhero as she does not specifically go after super-villains except when they attack her, and that she doesn't really save people. Nefcy said that the episodes balance comedy and drama: \"we really want our characters to feel like teenagers and have them going through the normal emotions that teenagers go through, but in this magical setting.\"\n\nStoryboarding and design are done in Los Angeles. In describing the process, Nefcy said that the show is storyboard-driven, with each episode mapped out by the storyboard artists. The storyboarders also do the writing, taking a two-page outline and turning it into a full script. A storyboard for 11 minutes would require about 2000 drawings to be done in a six-week period. After pre-production in the US, the first season animation was done at Mercury Filmworks in Ottawa, Canada. Mercury had also done \"Wander Over Yonder\" and the \"Mickey Mouse\" series. For the rest of first season, the animation was done in the Philippines. The second season was animated by Sugarcube and Rough Draft Studios, both located in South Korea.\n\nThe theme song was done by Brad Breeck, who also did \"Gravity Falls\" opening theme; Nefcy said: \"when we were listening to it we didn't know, because we just listened blind\". Brian Kim was chosen among a group of about ten people as the show's composer. Kim describes the music for each dimension as having a different sound and relating it to indie rock in Los Angeles.\n\nThe show was initially scheduled to premiere on Disney Channel after being greenlighted in March 2013, for a premiere in the Fall of 2014, before being switched over to Disney XD. However, on February 23, 2018, it was announced that the show would be moving to Disney Channel for its fourth season.\n\nThe show's title sequence was promoted at Comic-Con 2014 six months prior to its scheduled broadcast premiere. As a result, the footage was uploaded by fans to YouTube who then started generating fan art and fan fiction. The first episode premiered on Disney Channel in January 2015. The positive reaction on social media prompted Disney XD to order a second season of the series in February 2015, six weeks ahead of its launch of the series on Disney XD in March. Disney sitcom actors Olivia Holt and Kelli Berglund participated in promoting the series the weeks before its Disney XD premiere, with Holt dressing up as Star.\n\nThe second season premiered on July 11, 2016, The show's third season was ordered ahead in March 2016. It premiered on July 15, 2017 with a two-hour long television movie entitled \"The Battle for Mewni\" and consisted of the first four episodes. A live chat featuring Star and Marco was aired on Disney XD on July 17. The remaining third-season episodes started airing on November 6, 2017. A fourth season was also ordered ahead of the third season premiere.\n\n\"Star vs. the Forces of Evil\" premiered in Canada on the DHX-owned Disney XD on April 6, 2015, and was later moved to the Corus-owned Disney XD on December 1. The series premiered on Disney XD channels in the United Kingdom and Ireland on April 16, 2015, in Australia on August 3, and in the Middle East and Africa on October 5. It also premiered on November 8 on Disney Channel in Southeast Asia. The series premiered on March 6, 2016, as \"Star Butterfly\" in French on Disney La Chaîne in Canada. The show premiered on November 2 on Disney XD in Italy, and on Disney Channel on November 2, 2016.\n\n\"Star vs. the Forces of Evil\" has received positive reviews by critics.\n\nKevin Johnson of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the pilot episode a B+, saying that the show was something children could have a lot of fun with, noting how the show follows current trends in western animation \"towards large-eyed characters and quirky visual trends\". Johnson stated that \"Star vs. the Forces of Evil\" \"excels on wild, silly, and clever set-pieces to bring the laughs and action\", but expected that adult viewers won't get much out of it. Furthermore, the premiere of \"Star vs. the Forces of Evil\" became the most-watched animated series debut in Disney XD’s history. Following the end of the second season, Disney XD announced it had ordered a fourth season of the show, and that in 2016, \"Star\" and another animated show \"Milo Murphy's Law\" had reached over 100 million consumer views combined across its media platforms.\n\nIn reviewing episodes from the first season, Marcy Cook of \"The Mary Sue\" described the show as a blend of others such as \"Invader Zim\" and a sanitized \"Ren & Stimpy\", with great appeal to tween and teen girls as well some laugh out loud moments for adults. She said, \"[I]t's really cool to see a girl who is into cuteness and rainbows also kick-ass and enjoy it\". Cook was bothered by the short episodes that made the plot seem rushed or underdeveloped. Cook was bugged by Marco's retconned personality from the pilot episode where he was a safety conscious kid to the series where he was a martial arts fight seeker. Caitlin Donovan of entertainment website Epicstream listed it among her top 10 animated series of 2015. She found the first few episodes to be \"a little rough for me, like the show was trying too hard to be funny and weird\", but that the show got better with character development and relationship building, with \"a really dramatic, high-tension finale to the first season\".\n\nThe episode \"Party with a Pony\" was showcased in the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in June 2015.\nA comic book series titled \"Deep Trouble\" was written by storyboarder Zach Marcus and illustrated by character designer Devin Taylor, both of whom are part of the \"Star\" crew. They have been released monthly by Joe Books starting in September 2016. A \"Cinestory\" comic was also developed and released.\n\nThe book \"Star and Marco's Guide to Mastering Every Dimension\", authored by Amber Benson and supervising producer Dominic Bisignano, was released on March 7, 2017.\n\n"}

A dialogue in two parts, it is by far the longest one included in his collection of essays titled \"Intentions\" published in May 1891. \"The Critic as Artist\" is a significantly revised version of articles that first appeared in the July and September issues of \"The Nineteenth Century\", originally entitled \"The True Function and Value of Criticism.\" The essay is a conversation between its leading voice Gilbert and Ernest, who suggests ideas for Gilbert to reject.\n\nThe essay sets to collapse the distinction between fine art and criticism cherished by artists and critics such as Matthew Arnold and James Abbott McNeill Whistler - only critical faculty enables any artistic creation at all, while criticism is independent of the object it criticises and not necessarily subject to it. The essay champions contemplative life to the life of action. According to Gilbert, scientific principle of heredity shows we are never less free, never have more illusions than when we try to act with some conscious aim in mind. Critical contemplation is guided by conscious aesthetic sense as well as by the soul. The soul is wiser than we are, writes Wilde, it is the concentrated racial experience revealed by the imagination. Criticism is above reason, sincerity and fairness; it is necessarily subjective. It is increasingly more to criticism than to creation that future belongs as its subject matter and the need to impose form on chaos constantly increases. It is criticism rather than emotional sympathies, abstract ethics or commercial advantages that would make us cosmopolitan and serve as the basis of peace.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40115848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40115848", "title": "The Last Judgement (Martin paintings)", "text": "The Last Judgement (Martin paintings)\n\nThe Last Judgement is a triptych of oil paintings by the British artist John Martin, created in 1851–1854. The work comprises three separate paintings on a theme of the end of the world, inspired by the Book of Revelation. The paintings are generally considered to be among Martin's most important works, and have been described by some art critics as his masterpiece.\n\nThe paintings were Martin's last major works before his death in 1854. They were exhibited to the public from the time of his death until the 1870s to advertise the sale of prints from engravings of the works, being displayed in galleries and exhibition halls all over the UK, in New York in 1856–7 and in Australia in 1878–79. It has been claimed that up to eight million people viewed the paintings during their extensive tours.\n\nMartin's style of didactic expository art was rarely praised by art critics but remained popular with the public until the 1860s. He fell out of style by the end of the 19th century, and his works were pigeonholed as Victorian and religious by the early 20th century.\n\nCritical opinion of Martin's work improved from the 1940s, and the Tate Gallery bought \"The Great Day of His Wrath\" in 1945. The triptych was reassembled at the Tate Gallery in 1974 after Charlotte Frank donated the two other works following the death of her husband, Robert Frank. The paintings were the cornerstone of the first substantial exhibition of Martin's works at the Tate Britain in 2011–12, with a theatrical son et lumière show dramatising the manner of their exhibition in Victorian Britain.\n\nThe first element of the triptych, \"The Last Judgement\", is the central piece, intended to be displayed between the peaceful landscape of \"The Plains of Heaven\" to the left and the turbulent scene in \"The Great Day of His Wrath\" to the right. It combines elements of both, with a crowd of \"saved\" people to the left, and of the \"damned\" to the right, with the heavenly host above. A drawing in pencil and ink, signed and dated 1845, shows that this work was planned before Martin decided to paint a triptych, and Martin had started work on the painting by the end of 1849. Painted in oil on canvas, it measures by . \n\nThe work reflects the text of the Book of Revelation, which states that the Book of Judgement is sealed with seven seals, and describes the events that take places as each seal is broken. The breaking of the sixth seal triggers \"the great day of his wrath\" depicted in the second painting, followed by the last judgement after the seventh seal is broken.\n\nAccording to chapter 4 of the Book of Revelation, \"a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne ... and round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment: and they had on their heads crowns of gold\"; in chapter 8, \"four of the seven angels who have sounded their trumpets after the opening of the seventh seal\", and \"an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe ... to the inhabitors of the earth.\"; in chapter 9, a star falls from heaven and creates a bottomless pit: \"and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace\". The armies of Gog and Magog, \"the number of whom is as the sand of the sea\" are mentioned in chapter 20, and paradise is referred to in chapter 21: \"I saw a new heaven and a new earth ... the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband\".\n\nIn the background of the painting is the Celestial City, Jerusalem, drawing elements from Martin's earlier historical and architectural paintings, with the Plains of Heaven behind. The light of God pervades the work, with Christ sitting in judgement on the Throne of God in the centre, accompanied by 24 seated elders. Four angels sound trumpets after the opening of the seventh seal.\n\nBelow, a yawning chasm divides mankind into two parts: the \"saved\" are assembled on Mount Zion at God's right hand (that is, on the viewer's left) and the damned are gathered on the right. The virtuous men, women and children of the saved include portraits of around 40 famous people, many of which are painted on slips of paper that were pasted onto the canvas like a collage, awaiting their turn to appear before the throne. An engraved key was published in 1855 identifying the principal figures among the saved, including many artists, writers and scientists such as Thomas More, Wesley, Canute, Colbert, Washington, Chaucer, Tasso, Corneille, Shakespeare, Copernicus, Newton, and Watt.\n\nThe damned include richly dressed women, notably Salome daughter of Herodias, and the whore of Babylon, and also lawyers and clergymen, including a bishop and a pope. A railway train with carriages labelled \"London\" and \"Paris\" tumbles into the bottomless pit. The forces of Satan are being defeated, with the armies of Gog and Magog also falling into the abyss. \n\nThe painting shows the time when \"Heaven and Earth are passing away, and all things are made new.\" According to Mary L. Pendered's 1923 book \"John Martin, Painter: His Life and Times\", Martin originally intended to call the painting \"All Things Made New\".\n\nThe painting was retained by Martin's family after his death until it was sold in 1935. It was acquired by Robert Frank in 1947, inherited by his wife Charlotte Frank in 1953, and left to the Tate Gallery in memory of her husband in 1974.\n\nThe second work in the triptych, \"The Great Day of His Wrath\", was intended to be hung to the right of \"The Last Judgement\", and continues the theme of destruction and damnation depicted on the right side of the central image.\n\nThe Book of Revelation describes a scene that is painted by Martin: \"... and, lo, there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood. And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.\" The collapsing pile of rocks to the right of the painting are the buildings of an entire city falling into an abyss.\n\nThe oil on canvas work measures by . It was bought by the Tate Gallery in 1945.\n\nThe third work in the triptych, \"The Plains of Heaven\" was intended to be hung to the left of \"The Last Judgement\", and continues the pastoral landscape occupied by the \"saved\" on the left side of the central image.\n\nThe landscape resembles the Italian views painted by J. M. W. Turner, with serene open vistas of greenery. Martin painted similar landscapes in watercolours around 1850; examples include \"The Traveller\" and \"Joshua spying out the Land of Canaan\". The scene resembles Martin's 1841 painting of \"The Celestial City and River of Bliss\".\n\nThe oil on canvas work measures by . Along with \"The Last Judgement\", the painting was left to the Tate on the death of Charlotte Frank in 1974, in memory of her husband Robert Frank.\n\nMartin signed an agreement with the publisher and printseller Thomas Maclean in June 1851, under which Martin's painting \"The Great Day of His Wrath\" would be engraved and the painting would be exhibited to publicise subscriptions for the print. Maclean was to retain two thirds of the net profits from the print, with Martin receiving one third. The painting was sent to the engraver, Charles Mottram, by the end of 1851. Martin probably started work on the second and third paintings before the end of 1851, and a second agreement for their engraving was signed on 23 June 1852.\n\nMartin suffered a stroke in November 1853, and died on 17 February 1854. Seven days earlier, the pictures were first exhibited together in Newcastle upon Tyne, where they were shown at the Victoria Rooms in Grey Street from 10 February to 4 March 1854 (\"The Last Judgement\" had been put on display on its own at Maclean's gallery in London in June 1853). The paintings were accompanied by an explanatory pamphlet, a technique that Martin has used with his earlier Biblical pictures. The paintings went on an extensive tour of provincial cities, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, York, Hull, Leeds, Oxford, Birmingham, Liverpool, Huddersfield, Sheffield, Leicester, Bristol and Chester. There was initially some suggestion that the paintings were unfinished, but they were signed by Martin and he had consented to the tour, although Maclean had considerable rights over them under his agreement with Martin. The painting were exhibited in London in May 1855, at the Hall of Commerce at 52 Threadneedle Street.\n\n\"The Morning Post\" of 3 May 1855 greatly admired them: 'the simple grandeur of the conception, the broad artistic arrangement, and the wonderfully inventive faculty in detail. ..will serve to place the fame of Martin in a much higher position than any of his former labours'.\n\nThe paintings visited Dublin in March 1856, and the United States in 1857. The Mottram mezzotint engravings were finally published in 1857, in New York and London. The paintings were back in London in 1860, at Mabley's in the Strand. Tours of Britain continued for more than a decade, with the last recorded exhibition in Hexham in 1872. They were exhibited in Australia in 1878-9, where they were shown in at a gallery in Melbourne and were included unofficially in the British Court at the Sydney International Exhibition. Sydney International Exhibition (1879)\n\nIt has been claimed that up to eight million people viewed the paintings during the extensive tours.\n\nThe ownership of the paintings after Martin's death remains unclear. They are not mentioned in his will, and the agreement with Maclean (which gave Mclean two thirds of the profits from the sale of prints, and the right to use the paintings to market the prints) meant that they were on tour for decades. It seems likely that they were bequeathed to a cousin, Maria Thompson, who had married the son of the Thomas Wilson, his host during his regular visits to the Isle of Man and who nursed him in his final illness. There was also a family connection - the Thomas Wilson was married to the sister of Martin's wife.\n\nThe works remained in the extended Wilson-Martin family - in the possession of the artist's son Charles by about 1872 - and his son Thomas Carew Hunt Martin lent the paintings for an exhibition at Earls Court in 1897. They were repeatedly put up for sale by auction but there were no buyers. By the 1890s, they were displayed \"in a dingy room\" at Alexandra Palace, and then on the staircase at the Dore Gallery from around 1900 to the 1920s. By 1923, they had been taken out of their frames and were rolled up and stored in a warehouse. They were sold at auction in 1935 for £7 by Rex Nan Kivell, manager of the Redfern Gallery. The Tate bought \"The Great Day of his Wrath\" from Kivnell in 1945. After the sale, \"The Last Judgement\" was cut into four strips to decorate a screen. It was acquired by Robert Frank in 1947 and restored. Frank also acquired \"The Plains of Heaven\". The triptych was reassembled at the Tate Gallery in 1974 after Charlotte Frank donated the two other works following the death of her husband, Robert Frank.\n"}

The painting depicts a Romantic panorama of the Connecticut River Valley just after a thunderstorm. It has been interpreted as a confrontation between wilderness and civilization. \n\nBetween 1833 and 1836, American painter and putative \"founder\" of \"The Hudson River School,\" Thomas Cole, had been hard at work on his series of paintings \"The Course of Empire\". The work was commissioned by New York patron Luman Reed, who had met Cole in 1832, and the two held a friendship largely based on Reed's generosity in buying Cole's paintings. Reed requested \"The Course of Empire\" to comprise no less than five paintings of a historic composition. Cole himself was excited by such a project, but doubt began to set in by the end of 1835. The work was slow and laborious, and Cole found great difficulty in painting the figures. Reed had begun to notice Cole was becoming lonely and depressed, and suggested that he suspend work on \"The Course of Empire\" and paint something that was more in his element for the April 1836 opening of the National Academy of Design's annual exhibition. Cole, in replying to Reed in a letter, stated that he felt obliged to finish the series as Reed had been so generous in his support, and instead suggested that he simply complete the last painting in the series and display that at the exhibition. Reed however, did not really like the idea, as he thought it might spoil the unveiling of the series as a whole. He suggested instead that he paint a picture much like the already completed second painting in the series, \"The Pastoral State\". This depicted a peaceful setting which Reed thought \"no man ever produced a more pleasing landscape in a more pleasing season.\" Responding in a letter in March 1836, Cole agreed to take Reed's advice and paint a picture for the exhibition, writing:\nFancy pictures seldom sell & they generally take more time than views so I have determined to paint one of the latter. I have already commenced a view from Mt. Holyoke—it is about the finest scene I have in my sketchbook & is well known—it will be novel and I think effective—I could not find a subject very similar to your second picture & time would not allow me to invent one.\nCole also comments that he used a larger canvas, as he was not able to ready a smaller frame in time for the exhibition, and moreover felt compelled to make a statement with the one painting he was to present.\n\nThe painting moves from a dark wilderness with shattered tree trunks on rugged cliffs in the foreground covered with violent rain clouds on the left to a light-filled and peaceful, cultivated landscape on the right, which borders the tranquility of the bending Connecticut River. In returning to painting landscapes, Cole was faced with the dichotomy of the untamed wilderness and land cultivated by man. While other painters of the Hudson River School would merge the two peacefully, Cole did not shy away from portraying the two as opposites and showing how the cultivation would destroy the natural wilderness, and as a result never meet in the painting. On the hill in the far background, logging scars in the forest can be observed, which appear to form Hebrew letters. This was first noticed by Matthew Baigell long after the landscape was painted. It reads as Noah (נֹ֫חַ) If viewed upside down, as if from God's perspective, the word \"Shaddai\" is formed, \"The Almighty.\" Cole gives himself a tiny self-portrait sitting on the rocks in the foreground with his easel.\n\nCole sold the painting at the exhibition to Charles Nicoll Talbot (1802–1874), merchant in the China trade. In 1838 he lent it to the Dunlap Benefit Exhibition, and later to the third annual exhibition of the Artists' Fund Society, which was held in New York in 1862. With his death in 1874, the painting was acquired from his estate by Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage, wife of Russell Sage. Olivia Sage was a known philanthropist, and her transfer of \"The Oxbow\" to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1908 would seem rather natural. However, she may have been inspired by a similar gesture in 1904 by Samuel P. Avery, Jr., who donated \"The Titan's Goblet\", another of Cole's well-known paintings, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Furthermore, Olivia Sage's attorney, Robert W. DeForest, was a secretary on the Board of Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum. The painting today resides in The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\n"}

Viewers of such paintings assume that Venus is admiring her own reflection in the mirror; however, since the viewer sees her eyes in the mirror, Venus is actually looking at the reflection of the painter.\n\nThis psychological effect is often used in the cinema, where an actor will be shown apparently looking at himself or herself in the mirror. What viewers see is different from what the actor sees, because the camera is not right behind the actor, but the position of the actor is often chosen so that his or her image is nicely framed in the mirror for the camera.\n\nAlthough the name of the effect refers to a woman, Venus, the effect is more general. The effect is seen with an animal apparently looking at itself in a mirror in \"The Lady and the Unicorn\" (French: \"La Dame à la licorne\") tapestries, where the unicorn appears to be gazing at its own reflection as it kneels on the ground.\n\nBertamini et al. (2010) conducted additional studies and confirmed that the Venus effect also occurs with photographs, and in real life when the person and the mirror are seen in a room.\n\n"}
{"id": "40550605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40550605", "title": "Videofag", "text": "Videofag\n\nVideofag was a storefront arts space that operated in Toronto, Ontario's Kensington Market from 2012 - 2016. Founded and run by couple William Ellis and Jordan Tannahill, who converted it from an old barbershop, the space became an influential hub for queer counterculture in the city. A flexible multimedia space, Videofag was designed to serve as a cinema, art gallery, nightclub or theatre space depending on the needs of any individual event. It also doubled as Ellis and Tannahill's home. Videofag often acted as a laboratory, in which artists were gifted residencies to explore new ideas. The space helped develop and premiere several shows that went on to high-profile presentations at major theatres and festivals internationally. \n\nVideofag's inaugural exhibition, in 2012, was a retrospective of local queer music collective Kids on TV. That year, the space also presented performances by Jeremy Bailey, Casey Mecija, Nina Arsenault, as well as Salvatore Antonio and Adamo Ruggiero's wildly popular \"Truth/Dare: A Satire (With Dance)\", a Madonna tribute show. Screenings included video work by Mike Hoolboom, John Greyson, Matthew Rankin, Adam Garnet Jones, Albert Shin, and The Hidden Cameras. \n\nPerformances presented in 2013 included Henri Fabergé's six-hour rock opera \"Feint of Hart\", Aurora Stewart de Peña's play \"The Lee Press On Nail Play\", Jane Montgomery Griffiths' play \"Sappho...In 9 Fragments\", Daniel Karasik's play \"The Biographer\", a concert by Rae Spoon, Sky Gilbert's play \"To Myself at 28\", Zach Russell's Grindr comi-drama \"Fixed\", poetry performances by bill bissett, and a trilogy of dance pieces by D.A. Hoskins. Videofag also premiered Sheila Heti's play \"All Our Happy Days Are Stupid\", the subject of her bestselling novel \"How Should a Person Be?\", featuring a cast of fourteen mostly non-actors from Toronto's literary, music, comedy, and visual art scenes. The play later enjoyed sold-out runs at Toronto's Harbourfront Centre and New York City's The Kitchen. That year, Videofag also hosted exhibitions by Vivek Shraya, Keith Cole, and Jesi the Elder, and group shows featuring work by Bridget Moser, Life of a Craphead, FASTWÜRMS, Kalup Linzy, Will Munro, and R.M. Vaughan, among others. One notable exhibition saw Videofag transformed into a satirical Wal-Mart pop-up store, in response to the bargain chain's announced intention to build an outlet in Kensington Market. Screenings and new media projects included those by Jennifer Chan (artist), Daniel Cockburn, Jon Moritsugu, Francesco Gagliardi, the Radical Faeries and \"Sissy Boy YouTube Night\", a program of Internet videos of childhood queer expression, curated by Jon Davies.. \n\n2014 saw Videofag presenting work by performance artist Narcissister, choreographer Andrew Tay, performance artist Jess Dobkin, artist Humboldt Magnussen, writer Jacob Wren, a gothic rock-opera by G.B. Jones and Caroline Azar of Fifth Column, an exhibition of Erik Kostiuk William’s \"Hungry Bottom Comics\", and the Queer Songbook Orchestra, in which a 12-piece chamber ensemble re-interpreted songs that have shaped the LGBTQ community. Videofag also played host to the Regional Support Network, a monthly screening series featuring film and video from specific communities, curated by filmmakers from those communities. Photographer Samra Habib’s exhibition ‘Just Me & Allah: Photographs of Queer Muslims’ garnered international media attention. ‘Homer’s Odyssey’, an exhibition exploring the cultural impact of The Simpsons on a generation of visual artists, also drew record crowds and significant press attention. Videofag’s 2014 artists in residence included performance artist Michael Dudeck, visual artist Sojourner Truth-Parsons, and theatre creator Stewart Legere.\n\nAmong Videofag's 2015 highlights were premieres of Karen Hines's play \"Crawlspace\", and Greg MacArthur's play \"A Man Vanishes\", a noir-thriller set at Videofag, and starring Tannahill and Ellis as themselves. The space also played host to exhibitions, performances, and residencies by dancer-choreographer Amanda Acorn, performance artist Alvis Choi, the post-punk band New Fries, director Alistair Newton, writer-artist Masha Tupitsyn, curator Xenia Benivolski, playwright Johnnie Walker, writer Michael V. Smith, artist Rajni Perera, drag queen Nancy Babcock, performance-maker Chad Dembski, and dancer-choreographer Dana Michel, among others. \nIn 2016, Videofag presented work by musician Lido Pimienta, playwright-performer Haley McGee, poet Aisha Sasha John, theatre makers Ted Witzl and Susanna Fournier, artist Walter Scott, and premiered playwright Salvatore Antonio's play \"Sheets\". \n\nVideofag presented a number of political cabarets on subjects including Canadian Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Jason Kenney, the Sochi 2014 Olympics and Yoko Ono. Every month Videofag also hosted The Spoke, a storytelling event presented by Toronto theatre company Outside the March. Videofag collaborated with a number of larger festivals and organizations to co-present events, including the Art Gallery of Ontario, Pleasure Dome, Inside Out Film and Video Festival, Buddies in Bad Times, and Theatre Passe Muraille.\n\nVideofag was listed as one of Toronto's Best New Art Galleries of 2012 and nominated as a Toronto Hero as part of the Torontoist's 2013 Heroes and Villains poll. Its closure in June 2016 spawned an outpouring of tributes in national media, and an honorary award from The Toronto Critic's Awards for its contribution to the community. \n\nIn November 2017, BookThug released \"The Videofag Book\", a collection of essays, photos, scripts, and reflections about the space.\n\n"}
