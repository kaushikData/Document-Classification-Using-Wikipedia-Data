First recorded in the 15th century in a legal document describing the boundaries between Camuston and the barony of Downie, and described in the 17th century by Robert Maule, it is a freestanding cross, rare in Eastern Scotland.\n\nThe cross is thought to date from the tenth century, and exhibits distinctive Hiberno-Scottish mission influences, in common with several other monuments in the area. Tradition and folk etymology suggest that the cross marked the burial site of Camus, leader of the Norse army purportedly defeated by King Malcolm II at the apocryphal Battle of Barry. The name of the stone is likely to derive from the extinct village of Camuston, which has a Celtic toponymy.\n\nThe Camus Cross is in the Downie Hills, approximately northwest of Carnoustie in Angus, Scotland. It is situated at the centre of a long avenue leading east-north-east through Camuston Wood from the Panmure Testimonial to the Craigton to Carnoustie road, at (). The avenue is part of Panmure Estate and leads, beyond the road, to the former site of Panmure House.\n\nThe freestanding cross is carved from Old Red Sandstone and stands high, approximately wide at the base, wide at the arms, and approximately thick. It stands on a low earth mound, wide (east to west), wide (north to south) and high, in the centre of the Camuston Wood avenue, facing east to west. All faces and sides are sculpted. The cross has suffered significant weathering, most notably on the west face, which has obscured some of the designs.\n\nThe stone bears no idiomatic Pictish symbols and, under J Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's classification system, it is a class III stone. Intact freestanding crosses of this age are comparatively rare, perhaps due to their vulnerability to damage, and the only ones in Eastern Scotland are the Camus Cross and the Dupplin Cross in Strathearn. Fragmentary remains of other crosses include heads found at Forteviot, St Vigeans and Strathmartine and shaft fragments found at Monifieth, Abernethy, Carpow and Invermay, as well as some socketed stones where crosses once stood.\n\nThe western face is divided into three sections. The uppermost section is almost completely weathered. The antiquarian Alexander Gordon, who described the stone in 1726 in his \"Itinerarium Septentrionale\", records this panel as holding a crucifixion scene, with the figure of a man at the right hand side and the left side completely defaced. Below this is a depiction of a centaur holding a bow, with the lowest panel having a symmetrical floral scroll design.\n\nThe eastern face is usually interpreted as a depiction of Christ flanked by angels above the four evangelists, although Robert Maule, in the earliest description of the stone, described the scene as Moses giving out the Law.\n\nThe carving on the Camus Cross shows distinct similarities with those on the Brechin Hogback stone and point to an Irish Ecclesiastical influence. The foliar designs on the north and south edges, originally seen as Ringerike-like (and hence, Scandinavian in origin), consist of tendrils and volutes with \"wave-crest\" thickening. These features bear closest similarity with Irish insular art of the late tenth century, and the treatment of the symmetrical foliar scroll design on the lower portion of the west face is diagnostically Irish. The full-face figures on the east face are of an identical type to those on the Brechin Hogback. In the case of the Brechin Hogback, the figures are carrying objects that are characteristic of early medieval Irish monasticism.\n\nThe Camus Cross is currently thought to be a late Pictish/early Gaelic era monument, dating from the 10th century. The earliest record of it is in a legal document of 1481, describing the boundary of the lands of Camuston, owned by Sir Thomas Maule, and the barony of Downy, owned by the Earl of Crawford. The boundary was described as running \"a magna cruce lapidea de Cambiston\" ('from the great stone cross of Camuston'). It was mentioned in the context of the Battle of Barry in Hector Boece's \"Historia Gentis Scotorum\" in 1527, and first described in detail by the antiquarian Robert Maule, who erected it at its present position in 1620, after moving it six feet to centralise it within the Camuston Wood avenue.\n\nCamus was the supposed leader of a Norse expeditionary force defeated by the armies of King Malcolm II at the Battle of Barry. Tradition, popularised in the sixteenth century by historian Hector Boece, states that Camus fled the battle scene when defeat was imminent, and was caught and slain at the point where the cross now stands. The battle, and its main protagonists, including Camus, are now known to be historically inauthentic.\n\nThe name of the cross is likely to derive from the village of Camuston. No trace of this village can be seen today, and it had ceased to exist by the time of the first Ordnance Survey map, published in 1888, but surveyed in 1857 to 1859. Its former location is indicated in the 1794 map by Ainslie, about half a mile to the east of the cross. Camuston can be found with earlier spelling variations, for example, 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425 and 1426, and has a Celtic rather than Scandinavian etymology.\n\nA burial disinterred in 1598, near the Camus cross, was attributed by Maule as being the body of Camus:\n\nNot far thearfra in the bank of Camstone, the zeir of God I fywe hundrethe nyntie and aught zeiris, thear wos ane greawe fownd withe ane bread stone on eury quarter thearof efter the forme of ane malt cobile, quharin did ly the heale bons of ane man of gryt statwre, the thee bone quharof ves neir als longue as bothe the schank and thee bone of any reasonable man of this age, the harne pan gryte, and vanted the palme bread of ane hand thearof, quhilk had beine the straik as appeirithe of ane sword, it wes thought to heawe beine Cames the chief mans bwriel.\n\nLittle information of the burial exists, but goods found in the cist were kept at Brechin Castle. These were sketched by Jervise and are typical of Bronze Age artifacts, found fairly commonly in the area.\n\n"}

It is a chorale cantata, based on the hymn \"\" by Paul Speratus. Bach composed the cantata to fill a gap in his chorale cantata cycle written for performances in Leipzig from 1724.\n\nThe cantata is structured in seven movements, framed as the earlier chorale cantatas by a chorale fantasia and a chorale four-part setting, of the first and the twelfth stanza in the original words by the reformer Speratus, published in the First Lutheran hymnal. The theme is salvation from sin by God's grace alone. An anonymous librettist paraphrased the content of ten inner stanzas to alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for a chamber ensemble of four vocal parts, flauto traverso, oboe d'amore, strings and continuo. He gave all three recitatives to the bass, like a sermon interrupted in reflection by a tenor aria with solo violin and a duet of soprano and alto with the wind instruments.\nBach composed the cantata for the Sixth Sunday after Trinity between 1732 and 1735. It filled a gap in his second annual cycle of chorale cantatas written for performance in Leipzig. In 1724, when he composed the cycle, he had an engagement in Köthen that Sunday, and therefore left the text for later completion. The cantata is based on a hymn \"\" by Paul Speratus, which was published in 1524 in the , the first Lutheran hymnal. The theme of the chorale is the Lutheran creed of salvation from sin by God's grace alone (justification by faith), summarized in the first stanza: \"Deeds can never help, ... faith beholds Jesus Christ, ... He has become the Intercessor\".\n\nThe prescribed readings for the Sunday are from the Epistle to the Romans, \"By Christ's death we are dead for sin\" (), and from the Gospel of Matthew a passage from the Sermon on the Mount about better justice than the justice of merely observing laws and rules (). The hymn in 14 stanzas matches the topic of the gospel. An unknown poet transformed the first 12 stanzas of the chorale to seven cantata movements. Dropping the last two stanzas, the librettist retaines the first stanza as the first movement, and the 12th as the last movement. He rephrased stanzas 2–4 to a recitative (2), stanzas 5–7 to a recitative (4), stanzas 9–11 to a third recitative (6). Ideas from stanza 8 were made an aria (5), and movement 3 is not derived directly from the chorale, but intensifies the conclusion of the first recitative. The three recitatives can be considered a sermon, according to Julian Mincham, who comments: \"All three speak of God's Laws; their bestowal, their fulfillment (or lack of it) and our attitudes towards them\", and who summarizes: \"The three recitatives were clearly planned as a cognate group and encapsulate the fundamental Lutheran creed. The two intervening arias, and finally the chorale, reflect upon and extend their statements.\" The Bach scholar Christoph Wolff assumes that the text was already written for Bach's 1724 cycle of chorale cantatas by the same librettist.\n\nBach had used selected stanzas of the hymn before, in 1716 stanza 12 to conclude , in 1723 both stanza 12 and 11 to conclude the two parts of , and in 1724 stanza 11 to conclude .\n\nBach structured the cantata in seven movements, framing by a chorale fantasia and a closing chorale a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. He scored it for a chamber music ensemble of four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir SATB, flauto traverso (Ft), oboe d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), one of them solo (Vs), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). The autograph title page reads: \"Dominica 6. post Trinitatis / Es ist das Heil uns kommen her / a / 4 Voci / 1 Traversa / 1 Hautb: d'Amour / 2 Violini / Viola / e / Continuo / di / Joh:Sebast:Bach\".\n\nIn the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.\n\nThe opening chorus, \"\" (It is our salvation come here to us), is a chorale fantasia, the vocal part embedded in a concerto of the instruments. The cantus firmus of the chorale melody is in the soprano in unadorned long notes, while the lower voices engage in imitation. The scoring with the obbligato instruments flute and oboe d'amore in contrast to the strings is unusual, sometimes the first violin takes also part in the concerto.\n\n\"\" (God gave us the Law), is the first of three recitatives which are sung by the bass as the (voice of Christ), almost like one sermon, which is only deepened by the two arias in between. The recitatives are secco with the only exception of the final line of movement 4, \"\" (... embrace the arms of Jesus), which is rendered arioso, in \"an enlightening major key, a tender vocal phrase and the late semi-quaver continuo line\".\n\nThe tenor aria depicts the \"sinking\" of \"\" (We were already too deeply sunk) in downward motifs and an irregular rhythm of syncopes, observed by Dürr as an image of \"a giddy descent into the abyss of sin\".\n\nThe bass continues the \"sermon\", \"\" (Yet the Law must be fulfilled).\n\nThe duet \"\" (Lord, you see, instead of good works) is set for five parts of equal weight, the soprano and alto voices, flute, oboe d'amore and continuo, in intricate canonic counterpoint in da capo form.\n\nThe bass continues the \"sermon\" a third time, \"\" (When we recognize our sin against the Law).\n\nThe closing chorale, \"\" (Although it appears that He does not will it), is set for four parts. While Bach's closing chorales are often in simple homophony, the lower voices are set here in unusual polyphony.\n\nThe listing is taken from the selection on the Bach Cantatas Website. Recordings have traditionally been made by large symphonic groups, but increasingly in historically informed performances (HIP) by boys' choirs, chorales (, choir dedicated to mostly church music), chamber choirs or groups with on voice per part (OVPP), and matching instrumental ensembles playing on Baroque period instruments in historically informed performance.

{"id": "1086901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1086901", "title": "Fairy painting", "text": "Fairy painting\n\nFairy painting is a genre of painting and illustration featuring fairies and fairy tale settings, often with extreme attention to detail. The genre is most closely associated with Victorian painting in Great Britain, but has experienced a contemporary revival. Moreover, fairy painting was also seen as escapism for Victorians.\n\nDespite its whimsical appearance, fairy painting is strongly rooted in the literary and theatrical influences of Romanticism, as well as in the cultural issues facing the Victorian era. Among the most significant of these influences were the fantasy themes of Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and \"The Tempest\". Other literary works, such as Edmund Spenser's \"The Faerie Queene\" and Alexander Pope's mock-heroic \"The Rape of the Lock\" have been cited as contributing influences as well. Innovations in stage production helped bring these works to the public eye, as the development of gaslight and improvements in wire-work led to increasingly elaborate special effects. Although once described by Douglas Jerrold as \"a fairy creation that could only be acted by fairies\", productions of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" became more common, eventually leading to an 1863 spectacle featuring Ellen Terry as Titania astride a mechanical mushroom.\n\nCultural changes were also an important factor during this period. Continuing industrialization was uprooting longstanding traditions, and rapid advances in science and technology, especially the invention of photography, left some people discomforted and confused. According to Jeremy Maas, the turn to mythological and fantasy elements, and in particular to the fairy's world, allowed an escape from these demands. \"No other type of painting concentrates so many of the opposing elements of the Victorian psyche: the desire to escape the drear hardships of daily existence; the stirrings of new attitudes toward sex, stifled by religious dogma; a passion for the unseen; the birth of psychoanalysis; the latent revulsion against the exactitude of the new invention of photography.\" The significance of fairy paintings as a reaction to cultural change is not universally accepted, however. \"Ultimately,\" Andrew Stuttaford wrote, \"these paintings were just about fun.\"\n\nThe earliest artists considered to have contributed to the genre predate much of Romanticism and the Victorian era. Henry Fuseli and William Blake produced works that would be indicative of the later genre even before 1800. However, the artist most closely associated with fairy painting was outsider artist Richard Dadd, a suspected schizophrenic who produced most of his work while incarcerated in the Bethlem psychiatric hospital for the murder of his father. Despite his status and condition, his fantastic subjects and extraordinarily detailed style were generally well-received, with one period reviewer describing his work as \"exquisitely ideal\". He accompanied his masterpiece, \"The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\", with an elaborate poem providing historical, literary, or mythological context to each of the characters depicted.\n\nFairy painting was not exclusively the domain of outside art, however. The work of John Anster Fitzgerald debuted at London's Royal Academy. His work, in the form a series of Christmas-themed fairy illustrations, received wider public visibility in the Illustrated London News. The Scottish artist Joseph Noel Paton exhibited two immensely detailed paintings, \"The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania\" and \"The Reconciliation of Titania and Oberon\", based on the popular fairy scenes of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Even Edwin Landseer, sometimes named \"Victoria's favourite artist\", produced a painting of Titania and Bottom in the genre's style, his \"Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\n\nThe genre also influenced the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the movement it began. Co-founder John Everett Millais produced a series of fairy paintings based on \"The Tempest\", ending with his 1849 work \"Ferdinand Lured by Ariel\". Dante Gabriel Rossetti, another of the Brotherhood's initial members, took a more sensual approach to the subject, in both painting and poetry. Others involved with the movement, such as Arthur Hughes and William Bell Scott, also contributed to the genre.\n\nAlthough the Cottingley Fairies briefly revived interest in fae subjects, the waning of Romanticism and the advent of World War I reduced interest in the styles and topics popular during the Victorian era. The illustrated fairy-tale books of Arthur Rackham are considered its \"final flowering\".\n\nThe interest in fantasy art and literature since the 1970s has seen a revival in the topics and styles of Victorian fairy painting, often in novel contexts. While artists such as Stephanie Pui-Mun Law have produced genre illustrations for book covers and role-playing games, the works of Brian Froud, also known for a series of illustrated fairy books, have been adapted into several successful motion pictures including \"The Dark Crystal\" and \"Labyrinth\". A 2003 book, \"The Art of Faery\", written by David Riche and mentored by Froud, contributed to the careers of twenty fairy artists of this revival movement, including Amy Brown, Myrea Pettit, Jasmine Becket-Griffith, Philippe Fernandez, James Browne, and Jessica Galbreth, many of whom went on to author individual art books. Depictions of fae have made their way into the popular culture in other ways as well, including clothing designs, ceramics, figurines, needlecraft, figurative art, quilting, many marketed through Hot Topic to an international market online. Part of the growth in popularity over the past three decades is due to the New Age Movement. Renaissance fairs and science fiction conventions have also developed modern fairy art as a genre of collectibles.\n"}
{"id": "33843057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33843057", "title": "Fantasy coffin", "text": "Fantasy coffin\n\nThe fantasy or figurative coffins from Ghana, in Europe also called \"custom\", \"fantastic\", or \"proverbial coffins\" (\"abebuu adekai\"), are functional coffins made by specialized carpenters in the Greater Accra Region in Ghana. These colourful objects which have developed out of the figurative palanquins are not only coffins, but considered real works of art, were shown for the first time to a wider Western public in the exhibition \"Les Magiciens de la terre\" at the \"Musée National d’Art Moderne\" in Paris in 1989. The seven coffins which were exposed in Paris were done by Kane Kwei (1922–1992) and by his former assistant Paa Joe (b.1947). Since then, these art coffins of Kane Kwei, his grandson Eric Adjetey Anang, Paa Joe, Daniel Mensah (Hello), Kudjoe Affutu and other artists have been displayed in many international art museums and galleries around the world.\n\nThe reason that mainly the southern Ghana-based Ga people use such elaborate coffins for their funerals is explained by their religious beliefs regarding the afterlife. They believe that death is not the end and that life continues in the next world in the same way it did on earth. Ancestors are also thought to be much more powerful than the living and able to influence their relatives who are still alive. This is why families do everything they can to ensure that a dead person is sympathetic towards them as early as possible. The social status of the deceased depends primarily on the importance, success and usage of an exclusive coffin during a burial.\n\nFantasy coffins are only seen on the day of the burial when they are buried with the deceased. They often symbolise the dead people’s professions. Certain shapes, such as a sword or stool coffin, represent regal or priestly insignia with a magical and religious function. Only people with the appropriate status are allowed to be buried in these types of coffins. Various animals, such as lions, cockerels and crabs can represent clan totems. Similarly, only the heads of the families concerned are permitted to be buried in coffins such as these. Many coffin shapes also evoke proverbs, which are interpreted in different ways by the Ga. That is why these coffins are also called proverbial coffins (\"abebuu adekai\") or in the Ga language \"okadi adekai\".\n\nAmong the Christians the use of custom coffins is relatively new and began in the Greater Accra Region around 1950. These coffins were formerly used only by the Ga chiefs and priests, but since around 1960 figurative coffins have become an integral part of the local funeral culture. The Christians had taken over the figurative coffins from the traditional Ga who were using figurative palanquins and coffins already since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe invention of these figurative coffins is usually attributed to Seth Kane Kwei, though the anthropologist Roberta Bonetti and especially Regula Tschumi question this myth. The idea of making and using custom coffins was inspired by the figurative palanquins in which the Ga chiefs were carried, and in which they were sometimes buried. Ataa Oko (b.1919), of La, according to a few sources, could have started making custom coffins and figurative palanquins around 1945. Along with Kane Kwei from Teshie and Ataa Oko from La, other carpenters may have started this innovative art form the early 1950s.\n\nFigurative coffins are produced only to order. Every master craftsman employs one or more apprentices, who carry out a large part of the work. This allows the artist to make several coffins simultaneously. The coffins are generally made from the wood of the local wawa tree. In the interests of durability, items produced for museums are constructed from mahogany or some other high-grade hardwood so as to guard against cracking and attacks by insects when transferred from one climate to another. \nA coffin will take two to six weeks to produce, depending on the complexity of the construction and the carpenters’ level of experience. In urgent cases several carpenters will work on a single item. All woodworking is done using the simplest tools, without the aid of electrical appliances. \nThe painting of the figural coffins can take up to two days to finish.Some models are painted by the head of the workshop, others by local sign writers, some of them are even well known on the western art market for their hand-painted movie posters. Coffin-makers and sign-painters usually decide together which patterns and colours to use for a coffin.\n\n was born in 1985 in Awutu Bawyiase, Central Region, Ghana. Kudjoe Affutu was trained 2002 until 2006 by Paa Joe in Nungua, Greater Accra Region. Since 2007 he runs his own workshop in Awutu Bawyiase, Central Region. \nKudjoe Affutu has collaborated already with different European artists, among them with Thomas Demand, Sâadane Afif and the artist duo M.S. Bastian/Isabelle L. Kudjoe Affutus coffins were exhibited in the Centre Pompidou Paris, In the Tinguely Museum Basel, in the Nouveau Musée National de Monaco and in the Musée d'ethnographie Neuchâtel.\n\nBorn in 1985, Eric Adjetey Anang is the grandson of Seth Kane Kwei. He is running the Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop with his father Cedi since 2005, after he graduated from Accra Academy. Since 2009, Eric Adjetey Anang has been the subject of several documentary movies produced in the UK, France, Brasil, Japan, Norway and the USA. He has been invited as a resident artist in Russia, USA, Belgium, Denmark and organises residences for foreign artists in Ghana. Among other international events, Eric Adjetey Anang was invited in Italy for the Milan Design Week in 2013, in South Korea for the Gwangju Biennale of Design in 2011.\n\nPaa Joe was born in 1947 in the region of Akwapim, Ghana. He did his apprenticeship with Kane Kwei in Teshie, but left his master 1974. In 1976 he opened his own workshop in Nungua. In 1989 he was invited at the exhibition \"Les Magiciens de la terre\" in Paris. Since then his coffins have been shown all over the world. In 2005 they were exhibited in the Jack Shainman Gallery in New York and Jack Bell Gallery London. 2006 he participated in the exhibition \"Six Feet Under\" at the \"Kunstmuseum Bern\". In 2007, he opened a new workshop in Pobiman near Accra. in May 2013 he was in an Artist residence in UK with his son Jacob making a lion coffin, and 2016 the Artdocs film \"Paa Joe and the Lion\" made by Benjamin Wigley and Anna Griffin (producer) came out.\n\nEric Kpakpo was born in 1979 in Nungua, Ghana. He learned carpentry from 1994 until 2000 at Paa Joe's workshop in Nungua. He remained there as a master carpenter until 2006 when he opened his own coffin studio in La.\n\nDaniel Mensah, also called \"Hello\", was born in 1968 in Teshie, Ghana. He did his six-year apprenticeship with Paa Joe in Nungua. He then spent eight more years with Paa Joe. Only in 1998 did he open his own studio, \"Hello Design Coffin Works\", in Teshie. He participated in various art exhibitions and in some European film projects. In 2011, he had an exhibition in the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts.\n\nAtaa Oko (1919-2012) was born in the coastal town of La, Ghana. From 1936 to 1939 he was trained as a carpenter in Accra. Ataa Oko was, until 2002, not in contact with foreigners, he only made coffins for Ghanaian customers and thus remained unknown in Western art circles. In 2006, his work was for the first time exhibited at the art museum in Bern. Uninfluenced by Western customers, Ataa Oko had developed his own form of artistic language. His work is therefore different from those artists which come out of Kane Kwei's tradition. Therefore, it differs not only in terms of design, materials, but overall appearance. From 2005 to his death in 2012, he became a painter under the supervision of anthropologist Regula Tschumi. 2010/11 he had his first one-man show in a western Art museum, in the Collection de l'Art Brut in Lausanne.\n\n\n"}

It took place in the region of Lombardy and spread into Catalonia and into the south of France. Its principal decoration for the exterior, bands of ornamental blind arches are called lombard bands. It was characterized by thick walls and lack of sculpture in facades, and with interiors profusely painted with frescoes.\n\nDuring the first quarter of the 11th century, much architectural activity by groups composed of Lombard teachers and stonemasons (\"Comacine Guild\"), who worked throughout much of Europe and Catalan territories and erected fairly uniform temples, some of which still exist today. For a considerable area this process of craft diffusion started in Lombardy and \"Lombardus\" became the word for \"mason\" at an early period. One might call the First Romanesque style the style of this Italian architectural reconquest. The large promoter and sponsor of this art in Catalonia was Oliva, monk and abbot of the monastery of Ripoll who, in 1032, ordered the extension of the body of this building with a façade with two towers, plus a transept which included seven apses, all decorated on the outside with the Lombardic ornamentation of blind arches and vertical strips.\n\nCatalan architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch suggested that what was formerly considered the late form of pre-Romanesque architecture in Catalonia bore features of Romanesque and thus classified it as First Romanesque (\"primer romànic\"). The First Romanesque churches of the Vall de Boí were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in November 2000.\n\nThe geographical proximity of this Iberian region to the rest of Europe, resulted in depictions of the emerging Romanesque art being brought to Catalonia. While the art failed to take root in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula until the second third of the 11th century, there are numerous examples of its presence in Catalan counties before this time. Though this style may not be considered fully Romanesque, the area contained many of the defining characteristics of this artistic style.\n\nTo avoid the term Pre-Romanesque, which is often used with a much broader meaning than is generally suited to refer to early Medieval and early Christian art, and in Spain may also refer to the Visigothic, Asturias, Mozarabic and Repoblación art forms, Puig i Cadafalch preferred to use the term \"First Romanesque\" or \"first Romanesque art\" to designate those Catalan anticipations of the Romanesque itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Kelly grew up in Adelaide, attending St Dominic's Priory College and completing an arts degree at the University of Adelaide, majoring in literature and classics. While at university she became involved in the women's movement and feminist theatre as well as singing with bands.\n\nAfter completing her degree Kelly worked at Flinders University as an activities director, booking bands and organising entertainment for students. In 1980 she moved to Melbourne to fill a similar role at La Trobe University. She sang in all-girl new wave band Toxic Shoc, which released their single \"Intoxicated\" in 1981. She volunteered at Melbourne's 3RRR as a host of \"Backchat\", a radio program discussing women's current affairs. In 1984 she co-ordinated the statewide Women's Arts Festival for Victoria's sesquicentenary.\n\nKelly began work in journalism at the age of 29. In 1988, she moved to Sydney to work on Triple J's \"The Drum\", a youth radio program offering opinion and analysis on politics and current affairs.

A writer, director and actress in films from mid 1906 to 1920, she wrote screenplays for 42 films. She performed in 87 films and is credited as the director of \"The Grandmother\" (1909).\n\nBorn as Genevieve Gauntier Liggett in Kansas City, Missouri, to James Wesley and Ada J. (Gauntier) Liggett, she was the middle child of three children. Her older brother was Richard Green Liggett (1880–1941) and her sister was Marguerite Gauntier Liggett (1891–1973), who married Swedish billionare Axel Wenner-Gren. Gauntier attended the Kansas City School of Oratory while in Kansas City. In 1904, she began her stage career. Gauntier made her way to New York City where she began her career in live theater using the stage name \"Gene Gauntier,\" and first appeared in films between acting jobs with stock company tours. She remembered in her 1928 autobiography \"Blazing the Trail\": “My funds were running low, and in a vague way I thought of the new opening for actors – moving pictures, but, like the rest of the legitimate profession, I looked on them with contempt and felt sure that my prestige would be lowered if I worked in them.\"\n\nIn June 1906, Gauntier was literally thrown into her first screen assignment when she was hired for a daredevil stunt, being filmed as a damsel thrown into a river for Biograph's \"The Paymaster\". It was a one-reeler, where she first met her long-time friend Sidney Olcott and Frank Marion. \n\nGauntier then returned to stage acting as the lead female role in George Ade's The County Chairman at Kansas City's Grand Opera House.\n\nIn 1907, Gauntier became more involved in the fledgling silent film industry, working for Kalem Studios. She became Kalem's star actress, dubbed by the studio as the \"Kalem Girl,\" and also became their most productive screenwriter in collaboration with director Sidney Olcott on numerous film projects. \n\nIn 1924, after her departure from the film industry, Gauntier reminisced about her time at Kalem as an intensely fruitful period of creative freedom, when her authorial control and influence extended well beyond acting: \"In addition to playing the principal parts, I also wrote, with the exception of a bare half-dozen, every one of the five hundred or so pictures in which I appeared. I picked locations, supervised sets, passed on tests, co-directed with Sidney Olcott, cut and edited and wrote captions (when in the United States), got up a large part of the advertising matter, and, with it all, averaged a reel a week. It was work in those days—but \"creative\" work, blazing the trail. We were always discovering new possibilities and each little success or surprise fed our enthusiasm. Mr. Olcott and I had no one over us. I scarcely ever submitted a scenario and never while abroad. The Kalem never knew what our picture was to be until they saw the first run in the projection room. We would have risked our lives (and did many times) out of sheer love for, and loyalty to the Kalem. For four years the same friends were together and we were known as the O'Kalems, and later, during the oriental tour, as the El Kalems.\" \n\nGauntier's astonishing range of creative decision-making at Kalem reflects the \"creative chaos in the early years [of the industry that] favored women’s relatively full participation while a new order in the industry mandated against it.\" By 1912, Gauntier had become disillusioned with the new conditions at Kalem, and left to start her own company, Gene Gauntier Feature Players.\n\n\"Tom Sawyer\" was the first of over three hundred screenplays Gene Gauntier either wrote and produced or sold. In 1907, she wrote the script for \"The Days of '61\", the first film ever made about the American Civil War. That same year she wrote the screenplay and acted in the first \"Ben Hur\" film. The film was adapted in two days:\"I was not familiar with \"Ben Hur\" and the mere reading of the book would take two days. But this time my self-confidence [in writing] was unlimited and I promised. What is more by dint of working nearly two nights I turned in the script on schedule...and we turned out the greatest spectacle and money-maker up to that time.\" \nAt the time, there was no copyright law to protect authors, and she wrote in her autobiography about how the film industry infringed upon everything. As a result of the production of \"Ben Hur\", Harper and Brothers and the author's estate (General Lew Wallace) brought suit against the Kalem Company, the Motion Picture Patents Company, and Gauntier for copyright infringement. The suit, which eventually settled the question of American copyright law for all time, took years to make its way through the court system but the United States Supreme Court finally ruled in favor of Harpers and Wallace, and against the film company.\n\nMost notably, Gauntier wrote and acted in 1912's \"From the Manger to the Cross\"; a film that Turner Classic Movies considers the most important silent film to deal with the life of Jesus Christ, and which has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\nIn December of 1912, Gene Gauntier left the Kalem Company and started the independent Gene Gauntier Feature Players Company, along with her long time collaborator Sidney Olcott and her actor husband Jack Clark. She was among a number of women silent film stars to start their own independent companies during this period. Others included Florence Lawrence with the Victor Company, Helen Holmes with the Signal Film Company, Flora Finch with the Flora Finch Company (1916-1917) and Film Frolic Picture Corporation (1920), and Marion Leonard with the Gem Motion Picture Company. In early 1914, Sidney Olcott resigned as producer at Gauntier's company to start his own Sid Olcott International Features. The cause of his falling out with Gauntier remains unclear. The Gene Gauntier Feature Players Company continued until 1915.\n\nNotable works include, \"The Civil War-era\" (1912), \"A Daughter of the Confederacy\" (1913) (adapted from Wallace Reid's stage play), \"Mystery of Pine Camp\" (1913), \"When Men Hate\" (1913), \"For Ireland's Sake\" (1914), \"A Daughter of Old Ireland\" (1914), and \"The Eye of the Government\" (1914). \n\nGauntier wrote and stared in many of the films her company produced, while Olcott is credited as the main director during this time. Gaunter Feature Players became competitors of Kalem and eventually faded into oblivion once Gauntier signed on with Universal Pictures and moved to Hollywood. \n\nIn 1920 at age thirty-five, and after writing forty-two screenplays and performing in eighty-seven films, Gauntier walked away from the business. In a 1924 interview with Photoplay, Gauntier explained her reasons for leaving: \"I was worn out and had lost enthusiasm, without which we cannot, of course, progress. My work in pictures had been too difficult, my strength was sapped and it had become drudgery, especially the new way in which they were produced [...] After being mastered of all I surveyed, I could not work under the new conditions. Domestic tragedy was the finishing touch and I was glad to get out while I could still retain some pleasant memories of the good old days.\" \n\nIn 1912, Gene Gauntier married actor Jack J. Clark. They were divorced in 1918.\n\nShe had a brother, Richard Gauntier Liggett and a sister, Marguerite Gauntier Liggett. Marguerite married wealthy Swedish industrialist Axel Wenner-Gren in 1909.\nGauntier had sailed to Europe frequently where her sister Marguerite was an opera singer who had trained and worked in Germany, and found herself stranded there when World War I broke out. After leaving filmmaking, she worked as the film and drama critic for the \"Kansas City Post\" in 1919, before returning to live in Europe where she remained for a number of years while writing her autobiography, \"Blazing the Trail\". The work was serialized in 1928–29 in the American magazine, \"Woman's Home Companion\", and the manuscript is on display in the Film Library of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Gauntier also penned two novels, \"Cabbages and Harlequins\" in 1929 and \"Sporting Lady\" in 1933.\n\nGene Gauntier died in 1966 in Cuernavaca, Mexico, aged 81. She is buried in Sweden at Häringe Slott close to Marguerite, her sister and Axel Wenner-Gren, her brother-in-Law.\n\nIn 1914, June 11 was declared as \"Gauntier Day\" at the International Exposition of Motion Pictures. \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "407241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=407241", "title": "Grip (job)", "text": "Grip (job)\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, grips are technicians in the filmmaking and video production industries. They constitute their own department on a film set and are directed by a key grip. Grips have two main functions. The first is to work closely with the camera department to provide camera support, especially if the camera is mounted to a dolly, crane, or in an unusual position, such as the top of a ladder. Some grips may specialize in operating camera dollies or camera cranes. The second main function of grips is to work closely with the electrical department to create lighting set-ups necessary for a shot under the direction of the director of photography.\n\nIn the UK, Australia and most parts of Europe, grips are not involved in lighting. In the \"British System\", adopted throughout Europe and the British Commonwealth (excluding Canada), a grip is solely responsible for camera mounting and support.\n\nThe term \"grip\" is from the early era of the circus. From there it was used in vaudeville and then in today's film sound stages and sets. Some have suggested the name comes from the 1930s–40s slang term for a tool bag or \"grip\" that these technicians use to carry their tools. Another theory is that in the days of hand-cranked cameras, it was necessary for a few burly men to hang onto the tripod legs to stop excessive movement of the camera. These men became known as the \"good grips\"—as they were constantly being instructed to \"keep a good grip on the tripod\".\n\nUS grips typically belong to the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). Canadian grips may also belong to IATSE or to Canada's other professional trade unions including Toronto's Nabet 700, or Vancouver's ACFC. British grips usually belong to BECTU (Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph & Theatre Union).\n\nOn all union jobs, grips do not touch the lights themselves. The placement of lighting instruments and electric power distribution is handled by the electricians who work under a gaffer. Grips handle all the non-electrical equipment that modifies the light. This work is done by setting stands that hold flags, nets, diffusing materials or other gobos that control the quality, intensity, or shape of the light.\n\nGrips also set \"passive fill\" which is a term for the reflected light that is \"bounced\" back onto a subject on the fill or non-key light side. The first choice for most film-makers' fill is a product known in the US as beadboard and called \"poly\", short for polystyrene, in Europe. It is rigid insulation made for the construction trade, but was adopted by the film trade because of its \"true-white\" color and \"soft\" bounce.\n\nGrips may also be called on to set \"negative fill\", which is the reduction of ambient or non-directional light, such as ambient sunlight, to raise contrast on the subject. This is achieved by setting \"solids\", made of black fabric, either flags (up to 4' × 4') or rags (6' × 6' or larger) on the non-key light side or wherever the negative fill is desired.\n\nWhen shooting day exteriors, grips perform similar functions, but with the sun as the primary light source. Grips use overhead frames up to 20' × 20' or larger for the shaping or filtering of sunlight. The lighting set-ups for these exterior shots can become quite extensive, and the use of boom lifts (called \"condors\") is common. Condors are especially useful at night when they are rigged to raise lights or diffusing material (up to 120 feet in the air) to create moon-effect lighting.\n\nGrips also satisfy rigging needs on set. Examples of simple rigs include the \"menace arm\", which allows a light to be boomed over set using one stand, or \"goalposts\" that span over top of set using two stands. More advanced rigs can include working with pulleys, steel cable or trusses. Grips also rig picture cars on process trailers, placing camera and lights around the vehicle for driving shots. This often includes the use of hood mounts, side mounts, suction cup mounts and proprietary clamps to attach film equipment to vehicles without causing damage.\n\nGrips also do \"blackouts\" and \"tenting-out\" windows and doors. When shooting interiors day-for-night on location, grips need to eliminate all daylight entering the set. If windows or other openings are not visible in a shot, the light may be blacked out with a cloth known as duvetyne or rags, and in rare cases, plastic sheeting. When windows or doors are seen from camera, black out tents must be created outside of windows to allow lights to be placed outside, or green screens to be seen through the window, lit only by lights placed by electricians.\n\nGrips are also responsible for safety on the set as it relates to the force of gravity. Insofar as stands, ladders, scaffolds, and overhead rigs are properly installed, grips are charged with making them safe because the other crew members must climb on, walk around, or otherwise negotiate the different grip set-ups. The key grip may even be held responsible for injuries that happen on set, especially if the injury is caused by a falling lighting instrument.\n\nA grip uses some tools typically used by mechanics and construction workers. As in those vocations, grips need hand tools at the ready.(Tools such as ratchet straps,wedges and a normal tool box)\n\nArm up (Arm down) – To raise (or lower) the arm of a crane.\n\nBaby – Light fixtures between 750 and 1000 watts that are manufactured with a 5/8 inch female receiver for attaching to mounting hardware.\n\nBaby Plate – Used for mounting light fixtures that have a 5/8 inch receiver, also known as a ‘baby,’ to a flat surface, such as a wall or floor.\n\nBar – A horizontal metal tube used to suspend lighting equipment.\n\nBatten – A narrow length of wood or metal used to fasten or secure equipment, such as the phrase “batten down the hatches.”\n\nBar Clamp (Furniture Clamp) – A clamp with two jaws attached to a bar that can be used to mount a small light fixture.

The opaque material can also be used to reduce reflected light.\n\nFeathering – A process of slowing down and speeding up a camera dolly extremely smoothly. For example, starting from a full stop, still position, the camera dolly must smoothly move up to the desired speed to capture the shot and then ease equally smoothly back to a complete stop.\n\nFlag – A Duvetyne-covered metal frame used to shield certain areas from unwanted light or to create shadow areas on the set. May also be known as a solid or a gobo.\n\nGobo – A commonly used acronym for “Go Between,” “Go BlackOut” or “Goes Before Optics,” it is a dark plate, screen or partial screen placed in front of a lighting source to shield a lens and control the shape of emitted light.

{"id": "53263116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53263116", "title": "Jess Thom", "text": "Jess Thom\n\nJessica Thom (born 14 July 1980) is a British theatre-maker and comedian best known for Touretteshero, an alter-ego and project aimed at increasing awareness of Tourette's Syndrome, the neurological condition which she was diagnosed with in her early twenties. The first Touretteshero production, \"Backstage in Biscuit Land\" debuted at Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2014. The show won critical acclaim and has since toured across the UK and internationally, including various performances across North America and Australia. Thom has also made numerous appearances on British television, notably an interview on \"Russel Howard's Good News\" which has garnered more than 400,000 YouTube views , and was reported on by \"The Independent\" and \"Metro\" newspapers.\n\nThom was born in London. She experienced involuntary vocal and physical tics throughout her childhood as a result of Tourette's Syndrome, but was not diagnosed with the condition until her early twenties. Thom has recurring vocal tics, the most common of which is the word 'biscuit' which she can utter up to 16,000 times a day. She has a younger sister, who Jess previously referred to as 'Fat Sister' in a vocal tic whilst she was dieting. Thom acknowledges that her condition presents challenges but seeks to avoid 'self-pity or mockery' and to 'celebrate the creativity and humour of Tourette's'.\n\nAccording to guidance notes for journalists written by the team at Touretteshero, and published by the Guardian:Although some aspects of [Tourette's Syndrome] are challenging, Jess does not describe herself as a 'Tourette's sufferer' under any circumstances. Instead she likes to be referred to as a 'person with Tourette's' or as simply as 'having Tourette's'. She is 'brave' for all sorts of reasons, but not because she is disabled.Thom has stated that she finds herself talking about and explaining Tourette's everyday in her day-to-day interactions: \"It doesn't always feel like a choice, more a tool for living...Often this is very functional, like explaining at the start of a phone call that I have Tourettes, answering a question or addressing sniggers on public transport.\" Thom regularly experiences discrimination as a result of having Tourette's. She has recounted one particularly bad experience in multiple interviews, when she went to see comedian Mark Thomas perform at Tricycle Theatre. Other audience members complained about the noise she was making as a result of her vocal tics and the venue's staff asked her to move into a sound booth, so she wouldn't be heard by other customers. Although initially the experience made her vow never to go to the theatre again, it eventually became the catalyst for her becoming a performer: \"The creative way to respond was to occupy that space as an artist\".\n\nThom is also a wheelchair user. Following the social model of disability, Thom sees most of the challenges she faces not as a result of her unique neurology and physical impairment, but as a result of the 'disabling barriers' created by society, telling BBC News in 2014: \"My wheelchair and my tics are not the thing that disables me; the thing that disables me is the inaccessible environment\".\n\nThom studied at the Royal College of Art, London, graduating in 2005.\n\nPrior to becoming a theatre-maker and performer, Thom's career began as a playworker, working with children and young people. She has also been a fundraiser and project coordinator at a charity based in south London.\n\nIn 2010, Thom and longstanding friend and collaborator Matthew Pountney co-founded Touretteshero. The idea started out as a way of engaging people with the creative and humorous side of Tourette's, with Thom dressing up in a superhero costume and delivering performances and workshops, especially to children and young people. In 2011, Thom appeared on Episode 3, 'Uses and Abuses' of Stephen Fry's five-part BBC series Fry's Planet Word, to discuss her Tourette's and coprolalia - the involuntary use of swear words which 10% of people with Tourette's experience. The following year, Souvenir Press published \"Welcome to Biscuit Land: A year in the life of Touretteshero\" based on entries on Thom's blog, for which Fry wrote the foreword. Touretteshero has also put on creative events, like 'We Forgot The Lot!' - a collaboration with Tate for children and young people with and without Tourette's.\n\nPartly inspired by her negative experience of attending the Mark Thomas gig, and taking its name from Thom's most common vocal tic 'biscuit', \"Backstage in Biscuit Land\" began development as a theatre piece which explores the creative opportunities of Thom's tics and also other people's reaction to them. In 2013, Thom met performer and puppeteer, Jess Mabel Jones at a performance of \"Beauty and the Beast\" by ONEOFUS (Mat Fraser and Julie Atlas Muz) in London. Mabel Jones would later become a lead collaborator on \"Backstage in Biscuit Land\". Mabel Jones's role in this 'one-woman show for two' is to make sure Thom doesn't stray too far off topic. Due to Thom's unique and sporadic ticcing, which is riffed on heavily in the show, no two performances are quite the same. The set for the show features 50 items that were the subjects of some of Thom's spontaneous vocal tics during the development cycle, including a 'babygrow for Les Dennis' and 'ducks dressed as pterodactyls'.\n\n\"Backstage in Biscuit Land\" received R&D funding from commissioning body Unlimited, but crowdfunding was sought to help bring the show to Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Reviews of the initial run at Edinburgh were very positive. Lyn Gardiner in \"The Guardian\" said: \"Jess Thom's condition lends her show an absurdist edge Samuel Beckett would be proud of...Tourette's and theatre make a joyous combo\". She also described it as \"extraordinarily entertaining\" awarding it four stars. Alice Jones in \"The Independent\" said: \"The humour is black but it's also daft and uplifting, and in places, impossibly moving\". TV Bomb, were perhaps most effusive with their praise declaring: \"There are more ideas and imagination in this one hour show than most of the Fringe programme combined,\" awarding it 5 out of 5.\n\nFollowing its success at Edinburgh, \"Backstage in Biscuit Land\" went on a tour across the UK throughout 2015 and 2016 including a notable performance at the Barbican, London. It continued to pick up glowing reviews with \"The Stage\" awarding it four stars and calling the show \"a properly joyous thing, funny, informative, and eloquent about the need for theatre to be more accessible to everyone. Broadway Baby also awarded the show 4 stars \"This show is one big tasty biscuit all right\". Later in 2016 the production went international with a tour of North America which included performances at New York's BRIC, Toronto's Harbourfront, San Francisco's International Arts Festival and Los Angeles' Skirball Cultural Center. Performances in Australia included at the Sydney Opera House, Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane and Melbourne International Festival. The performance at the latter earned the show 4 stars in the Australian edition of \"The Guardian,\" with Steph Harmon describing at as \"unpredictable, joyous, must-watch theatre\".\n\nThom appeared on ITV's \"This Morning\" in May 2012 and was interviewed at length by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. In March 2013, Thom appeared on RTE's Saturday Night Show with Brendan O'Connor. In September of that year, Thom delivered a talk about the misconceptions of Tourette's Syndrome at TEDxAlbertopolis, the first TED event to take place at London's Royal Albert Hall. Following her appearance on Fry's Planet Word in 2014, Thom appeared on Radio 4's The Today Programme, discussing Tourette's and BBC News discussing her ideas about 'freedom' later that year. In October 2015, Thom was interviewed on BBC's \"Russel Howard's Good News,\" with the broadcast apparently reaching some 3 million people. The next month a version of \"Backstage in Biscuit Land\", adapted for television entitled \"Broadcast from Biscuit Land\" had a 30-minute slot on BBC4's Live from Television Centre, the first live broadcast from Television Centre since the building was decommissioned in 2013. In 2016, Thom appeared on series 10 of Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast.\n\nTouretteshero won the 2014 Total Theatre Award, Best Emerging Company for \"Backstage in Biscuit Land\".\n\nThom is an outspoken advocate of disabled people's rights. Her personal outlook often inverts the typical negative stereotypes associated with disability, for instance she sees her Tourette's as a source of creativity and her wheelchair as a symbol of freedom. She advocates for empowerment of disabled people via the social model of disability, telling Exeunt: As a society there are still lots of people who think about disability solely in negative terms. The medical model – 'disabled people are broken and need to be fixed' – and the charity model – 'tragic and in need of help' – are ways of conceptualizing disability that remain widespread even though the social model of disability – 'people are disabled by a failure to consider difference' – underpins our legislation and public services.Following her own negative experiences of attending the theatre, Thom has campaigned to get more 'relaxed performances' (a performance where the audience are allowed to make noise and move around, which is more suitable for certain neurodiverse people) in theatres, as well as making every performance of \"Backstage in Biscuit Land\" a relaxed performance.\n\nThom has also been an outspoken critic of the UK Government's cuts to provision for disabled people, telling Disability Arts Online:So many of the structures that were in place to support disabled people to live independent lives have been dismantled in recent years. Ambitions are being capped because of the structures designed to disable and limit what we have access to. There is a big difference between having basic needs met and having the right to an independent life. With the abolition of the Independent Living Fund and Access to Work and all the other attacks on disabled peoples' rights our only option is to keep fighting.\n\n"}

He was created by David Chaskin and portrayed by Mark Patton. Making his debut in \"\" in 1985, Jesse became the first male protagonist of the series. In \"\", Freddy enacts a plan to possess Jesse, using his body to kill in the real world, slowly gaining the strength to manifest his form physically. Outside of the films, Jesse has a main role in the novels. Because of the LGBT representation in a mainstream film, Jesse has developed a large fan base in the gay community and has been called a gay icon. Jesse has been observed by some scholars as a variation of the \"final girl\" slasher film archetype, and has been referred to as a \"final boy\".\n\nIn \"\", Jesse is a high school student who moves into Nancy Thompson's old house on Elm Street with his family and begins to have nightmares about Freddy Krueger. Jesse first encounters Freddy in nightmare sequence that takes place on a school bus. Jesse takes his friend Lisa to school and becomes friends with a boy named Ron Grady after they fight. Lisa helps Jesse unpack his things after school and they find a diary from Nancy Thompson explaining her nightmares. Jesse realizes that Freddy wants to possess him and use his body to kill in the real world. Freddy successfully controls him and kill's Jesse's coach and attempts to kill Jesse's sister though Jesse is able to resist. \n\nHe seeks help from Ron and asks him to watch over him while he sleeps but when Ron falls asleep, Freddy regains control and murders Ron. Jesse retreats to Lisa's house during a party but Freddy again takes control, trying to kill her. Jesse fights back against his control and Freddy instead turns on the other teenagers present, murdering seven before disappearing. Freddy travels to the boiler room where he would take his child victims while still alive. Lisa confronts Freddy and Jesse is able to finally regain control, exorcising Freddy. After this incident while travelling on the school bus with Lisa, their friend Kerry is impaled through the chest by Freddy and the bus careers off the road, revealing Freddy is still alive and has again trapped Jesse. His fate is left ambiguous.\n\nJesse briefly appears in flashbacks during Freddy's introduction in \"Freddy vs. Jason\" (2003).\n\nJesse is the lead protagonist of the 1992 novelization of \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\". In 2012, Mark Patton released \"Jesse's Lost Journal\". There are 68 journal entries that span 1982-1985. The first 30 entries closely follow the events of \"\", though unveil new details not seen on screen (hints that Jesse's father is a pedophile; Jesse's platonic love for Lisa; his homosexual feelings for a classmate; his feeling of Nancy Thompson as a kindred spirit). There is a different conclusion in that Jesse supposedly kills Lisa Webber at the power plant, rather than the film's final bus sequence (although she is later revealed to have survived). The remaining 38 journal entries focus on Jesse's time at a psychiatric ward, his sentencing for murdering Ron Grady and the apparent disappearance of Lisa's corpse, his escape from the institution, and his efforts to build a new identity. Jesse still wrestles with Freddy Krueger in his mind, and enters into a panic when Hollywood begins making the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" films based on Jesse's and Nancy Thompson's journal entries.\n\nIn an interview, Mark Patton stated, \"I don't think that [the character] Jesse was originally written as a gay character. I think it's something that happened along the line by serendipity.\"\n\nMark Patton beat out actors such as Brad Pitt and Matt Damon for the role of Jesse and revealed that he based certain aspects of the character on Ally Sheedy's character in \"The Breakfast Club\" (1985). In an interview with \"Attitude\" magazine, Robert Englund stated \"... the second \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" is obviously intended as a bisexual themed film. It was early '80s, pre-AIDS paranoia. Jesse's wrestling with whether to come out or not and his own sexual desires was manifested by Freddy. His friend is the object of his affection. That's all there in that film. We did it subtly but the casting of Mark Patton was intentional too, because Mark was out and had done \"Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean\".\"\n\nIn his book \"Monsters in the Closet: Homosexuality and the Horror Film\", Harry M. Benshoff references Jesse, stating the following:\n\nIn \"The Queer Encyclopedia of Film & Television\", Claude J. Summers stated: \n\nIn \"Hearths of Darkness: The Family in the American Horror Film, Updated Edition\", Tony Williams notes that Jesse is a victim of a \"dysfunctional family situation.\" Jesse and Freddy's relationship is intended to have a homo-erotic subtext with Freddy representing Jesse's fear of 'coming out'. Commentators point to the lack of interest Jesse shows in Lisa and his retreat to Ron's bedroom after a failed attempt at kissing her, implying Ron is the object of Jesse's affection. At one point in the film, he also ends up in a gay S&M club where he is confronted by his homosexual gym teacher, Schneider. This plot is not made obvious in the film though Krueger-actor, Robert Englund and writer David Chaskin both admit to the concealed subtext, indicating that the casting of openly gay actor Mark Patton to play the role was intentional. In \"Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies\", Jim Harper describes Jesse as \"the main victim of the film.\" \n\nIn \"Remaking Horror: Hollywood's New Reliance on Scares of Old\", James Francis, Jr. dubbed the character as a \"final boy\" and noted the parallels between Jesse and Nancy Thompson, stating:\n"}

The frontier was composed of a road following the border, a military stronghold, a three-metre vallum 10–12 metres wide, reinforced with wood palisades on stone walls, and also a ditch. The Transalutanus limes was 235 km long, parallel to Olt river at a distance varying from 5 to 30 km east of the river. The construction was started in 107 under the command of Marcius Turbo, and developed under Iulius Severus (120–126); the final stage of the construction was performed under Septimius Severus (193–211 d.C.).\n\nBetween 244–247, under Philip the Arab, after the Carpian and Getae (or Goths, confusion due to Jordanes) attacks, the Roman Imperial army abandoned the limes for some time.

{"id": "39186584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39186584", "title": "Lukasa (Luba)", "text": "Lukasa (Luba)\n\n\"Lukasa\", \"the long hand\" (or claw), is a sophisticated memory device that was created, manipulated and protected by the Bambudye, a once powerful secret society of the Luba. \"Lukasa\" are examples of Luba art.\n\nThe story of the \"lukasa\" is closely associated with the history of the Luba kingdom, which dominated most of northern Shaba during the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century. No candidate for political office could receive his title without first becoming a member of the Bambudye society, and the ruler of the Luba kingdom held the highest ranking Bambudye title. Reefe states that while it is not possible to date the origins of the \"lukasa\", the high degree of integration of the lukasa into the structure of the Bambudye society and into the oral lore of the Luba kingdom strongly suggests that this art form is of considerable antiquity.\n\nCentral to Luba artistry, \"lukasa\" aids memory and the making of histories. Stools, staffs, figures, and complex choreographies complement the \"lukasa\" as Luba culture is remembered, produced, and transformed. \n\n\"Lukasa\" memory boards are hourglass-shaped wooden tablets that are covered with multicolored beads, shells and bits of metal, or are incised or embossed with carved symbols. The colors and configurations of beads or ideograms serve to stimulate the recollection of important people, places, things, relationships and events as court historians narrate the origins of Luba authority. A \"lukasa\" serves as an archive for the topographical and chronological mapping of political histories and other data sets.\n\nLukasa are approximately the same size (20-25 centimeters long and about 13 centimeters wide) and have the same rectangular dish shape. A row of carved mounds called \"lukala\" runs across their concave surface, dividing it in half. Beads and shells are attached to the board by small slivers of wood or hand-made iron wedges driven through their centers, and cowrie shells are frequently attached at the top and bottom. Beads are arranged in three ways: a large bead surrounded by smaller beads, a line of beads, and one isolated bead. Each configuration lends itself to the transmission of certain kinds of information. Board surfaces also have holes and lines cut into them.\n\nCourt historians known as \"bana balute\" (\"men of memory\") run their fingertips across the surface of a \"lukasa\" or point to its features while reciting genealogies, king lists, maps of protocol, migration stories, and the great Luba Epic, a preeminent oral narrative that records how the culture heroes, Mbidi Kiluwe and his son Kalala Ilunga, introduced royal political practices and etiquette. For Luba, how an object looks dictates how well it works.\n\nCulture heroes are identifiable by beads whose colors have a fan of connotations triggering remembrance of their deeds and exploits, as well as their qualities and physical appearance. For example, Nkongolo Mwamba, the tyrannical anti-hero of the Luba charter, is always represented by a red bead, for he is the red-skinned rainbow-serpent associated with bloody violence. Blue beads (considered \"black\") stand for Mbidi Kiluwe, the protagonist and culture-bearer of kingship whose skin is shiningly black like that of a bull buffalo, symbol of ambivalent power and secret potential. The paths of Luba migration and significant events and relationships are indicated by lines and clusters of beads. Chiefs and their counselors, sacred enclosures, and defined places are shown by circles of beads.\n\nMbudye is a council of men and women charged with sustaining and interpreting the political and historical principles of the Luba state. As authorities on the tenets of Luba society, Mbudye provide a counterbalance to the power of kings and chiefs, checking or reinforcing it as necessary. Members of Mbudye proceed through a series of stages within the society as they master successive levels of arcane knowledge. Only those at the apex of the association can decipher and interpret the \"lukasa's\" intricate designs and motifs. Mbudye members call the twin projections sprouting along the board's outer edge the \"head\" and \"tail\" of the \"lukasa\", zoomorphic elements that are meant to evoke the crocodile. An animal equally at home on land and in water, the crocodile's dual nature is suggestive of Luba political organization, whose existence relies on the interdependence of the kikungulu (the head of the Mbudye) and the kaloba (the \"owner of the land,\" or chief).\n\nThe \"lukasa\" fulfilled many mnemonic functions, for it could be interpreted in a number of ways, and while all memory boards shared certain common information, particular types of memory boards communicated specialized data. There were three distinct categories of lukasa, each emphasizing a certain kind of knowledge. First, the \"lukasa Iwa nkunda\", \"the long hand of the pigeon,\" bears information on mythical heroes and early rulers and on the mythical migration routes of the Luba. Second, the \"lukasa Iwa kabemba\", \"the long hand of the hawk,\" is concerned with the organization of the Mbudye society. A third type of memory board was created for the use of individual Luba rulers and contained secret information about divine chiefship. No examples of this type, referred to as the \"lukasa Iwa kitenta\", \"the long hand of the sacred pool,\"' still exist.\n"}

Winkler was the subject of a feature film Walt Before Mickey. \n\nHungarian-born of German descent, Winkler began her career as personal secretary of Harry Warner, one of the founders of Warner Brothers. Through most of the silent era, Warner Brothers was strictly a film distributor, and Harry Warner was the man who made the deals. In 1917, Warner Brothers began distributing cartoons of Mutt and Jeff in New York and New Jersey. Warner was impressed with Winkler's talents, and when Max and Dave Fleischer, owners of Fleischer Studios, came to him with their series Out of the Inkwell, he gave it to Winkler and encouraged her to form her own distribution company, Winkler Productions, on a state's rights basis.\n\nIn 1922, she signed a contract with Pat Sullivan Productions to produce Felix the Cat cartoons. This established her reputation as the top distributor in the cartoon world. It was a good thing, because at the end of the same year the Fleischer brothers, flush with success as a result of Winkler's work, left her to form their own distribution company, Red Seal Pictures. However much Sullivan helped Winkler's business, he and Winkler were constantly fighting. In September 1923, the renewal of his contract came up, and his unrealistic demands meant Winkler Pictures might have to survive for a while without its biggest star. Winkler viewed a pilot reel, called \"Alice's Wonderland\", submitted by then neophyte animator Walt Disney, the first entry in the \"Alice Comedies\" series. Winkler was intrigued with the idea of a live-action girl in a cartoon world, and signed Disney to a year-long contract despite the fact that the studio that made the cartoon was now bankrupt.\n\nDisney subsequently formed a new studio, Disney Brothers, which was the first cartoon studio in Hollywood and soon changed its name to The Walt Disney Company. Disney was helped by the tutelage of Winkler, who insisted on editing all of the \"Alice Comedies\" episodes herself. One of her suggestions was the addition of a suspiciously Felix-like character called Julius. This was apparently the \"straw that broke the camel's back\" for Sullivan, who signed with rival distributor E. W. Hammons of Educational Pictures in 1925.\n\nWinkler was the first female member of the Motion Picture Producer's Guild. To disguise her gender, she would sign letters \"M.J. Winkler.\"\n\nIn 1924, she married Charles B. Mintz, a film distributor who had been working for her since 1922. Soon after she had her first child and retired from the business, turning her company over to her husband. The couple had two children, Katherine and William.\n\nMargaret J. Winkler died, aged 95 on June 21, 1990 in Mamaroneck, New York.\n\n"}

She is an inn-keeper, who runs the Boar's Head Tavern, at which Sir John Falstaff and his disreputable cronies congregate. \n\nThe character appears in four plays: \"Henry IV, Part 1\", \"Henry IV, Part 2\", \"Henry V\" and \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\".\n\nIn all the plays Quickly is characterised as a woman with strong links to the criminal underworld, but who is nevertheless preoccupied with her own respectable reputation. Her speech is filled with malapropisms, double entendres and \"bawdy innuendo\". \n\nHer name may be a pun on \"quick lay\", though \"quick\" also had the meaning of \"alive\", so it may imply \"lively\", which also commonly had a sexual connotation. Quickly's character is most fully developed in \"Henry IV, Part 2\" in which her contradictory aspirations to gentility and barely concealed vulgarity are brought out in her language. According to James C. Bulman, she \"unwittingly reaveals her sexual history\" by her blithe malapropisms and \"her character is both defined and undone by her absurdly original speech\" \n\nThough her age is not specified, the comment that she is \"pistol proof\" has been interpreted to mean that she is past childbearing age, and she says she has known Falstaff for twenty nine years.\n\nIn \"Henry IV, Part 1\", Mistress Quickly is described as the proprietor of the Boar's Head Tavern in the London neighbourhood of Eastcheap. She is married, as Prince Hal asks after her husband, referring to him as \"an honest man\"; he does not appear in the play. She participates in the mock-court scene in which Falstaff pretends to be the king. \n\nIn \"Henry IV, Part 2\", she asks the authorities to arrest Falstaff, accusing him of running up excessive debts and making a fraudulent proposal of marriage to her (implying that she is now a widow). Mistress Quickly has a friendship of long standing with Doll Tearsheet, a prostitute who frequents the tavern, and protects her against aggressive men she calls \"swaggerers\". At the end of that play, Mistress Quickly and Doll Tearsheet are arrested in connection with the beating to death of a man by Ancient Pistol. \n\nIn \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" she works as nurse to Caius, a French physician, but primarily acts as a messenger between other characters, communicating love notes in a plot largely concerned with misdirected letters. At the end she takes the role of the queen of the fairies in the practical joke played on Falstaff.\n\nIn \"Henry V\", she is referred to as Nell Quickly. She is with Falstaff at his deathbed, and describes his death to his friends. She marries Falstaff's ensign, Ancient Pistol, despite having previously been engaged to Corporal Nym. While Pistol is away in France, he receives a letter from which he learns that \"my Doll is dead\", having succumbed to the \"malady of France\" (syphilis). Many editors take the name Doll to be a misprint for \"Nell\", but it has also been interpreted as a reference to Doll Tearsheet rather than Quickly.\n\nQuickly's role in \"The Merry Wives\" is sufficiently different from her role in the other plays that some critics have suggested that she cannot be the same character. Nothing suggests that she already knows Falstaff (or Bardolph and Pistol), and there is no explanation of how she comes to working for Dr. Caius. However, there are also many other continuity problems with other characters in the play. For example, the play is set at an unspecified period in the reign of Henry IV, but Shallow is feuding with Falstaff from the beginning, even though in the Henriad plays he only realises his mistake in trusting him after Henry V is crowned. These oddities may have arisen because the play was written rapidly for a specific occasion. There are some signs of attempts to make the events fit the action of the Henriad plays, for example the brief scene in which Pistol expresses his attraction to her and says \"she is my prize\". This fits with his marriage to her in \"Henry V\". There is no further reference to his pursuit of her in the play, but he plays the part of her consort in the fairy masque at the end.\n\nThere are similar, less glaring problems with the Henriad plays. In \"Henry IV, Part 1\" she is evidently a married innkeeper. No reference is made to the death of her husband in Part 2, just that Falstaff promises to marry her. Likewise, the tavern seems to evolve into a reputed brothel by the beginning of \"Henry V\".\n\nMistress Quickly appears along with Falstaff's other cronies in the play \"Falstaff's Wedding\" (1766), a comedy by William Kenrick, which is set in the period between the end of \"Henry IV, Part 2\" and the beginning of \"Henry V\". Mistress Quickly and Doll Tearsheet, having bribed their way out of prison, appear in the first act explaining to Falstaff how they were arrested. They later plot to disguise themselves as gentlewomen to find rich husbands, targeting Robert Shallow and his young cousin Abraham Slender. Quickly intends to marry Shallow, and Doll to marry Slender. The plan appears to succeed, but Shallow and Slender find out their true identities and switch places at the weddings with Ancient Pistol and Corporal Nym, so she ends up married to Pistol, as in \"Henry V\".\n\nJames White's book \"Falstaff's Letters\" (1796) purports to be a collection of letters written by Falstaff and his associates, provided by a descendant of Mistress Quickly's sister. She had inherited them from Mistress Quickly herself, who kept them in drawer in the Boar's Head Tavern until her death in \"August 1419\". The collection includes letters written by Mistress Quickly to Falstaff complaining of his behaviour.\n\nAlan Skinner's novel \"Master Quickly\" (2013) attempts to fill in the gaps in Shakespeare by revealing the truth about her neglected husband.\n"}

The team initially consisted of Sidney Drew (August 28, 1863 – April 9, 1919) and his first wife Gladys Rankin (October 8, 1870 – January 9, 1914). After Gladys died in 1914, Sidney Drew married Lucile McVey (1890–1925), and the two performed as Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Drew.\n\nSidney Drew or \"Mr. Sidney Drew\" as he was usually billed, was an uncle of actors Lionel, Ethel and John Barrymore. Drew's origins have been the subject of speculation. His mother Mrs. Louisa Drew said she adopted him not long after the death of her husband John Drew, Sr. in 1862. Researchers have speculated that Sidney was Mrs. Drew's biological child either from her late husband or from a love affair. It was noticed that she disappeared for some time to the country before returning to Philadelphia with baby Sidney. John Barrymore always said Sidney looked too much like Grandmother Louisa to be anyone else's child.\n\nIn his stage career, Sidney Drew was a light-hearted leading man along with his wife, Gladys Rankin, the first \"Mrs. Sidney Drew\". In 1896, the pair introduced legitimate drama to the vaudeville stage. They entered films as a team with the old Kalem Company in 1911, but achieved greater success after their switch to Vitagraph in 1913. Gladys Rankin Drew died later that year from undisclosed causes. Sidney Drew was briefly paired with Clara Kimball Young, with whom Drew starred in the two-reel melodrama satire \"Goodness Gracious; or, Movies as they Shouldn't Be\" (1914) directed by Clara's husband James Young. \nHe remarried to Lucile McVey, born in Sedalia, Missouri, a Vitagraph scriptwriter who briefly went under the name Jane Morrow. Sidney Drew added his new wife to his one-reel comedies, acknowledging McVey as both a writer and co-director. As a comedy team, known as Mr. & Mrs. Sidney Drew, the team perfected the situation comedy style that the team of John Bunny and Flora Finch started. Their style of comedy was usually gentle satire on married life, but also poked fun at the world of show business. Sidney took sole credit as director for two five-reel features at Vitagraph, the groundbreaking cross-gender comedy \"A Florida Enchantment\" (1914), in which Edith Storey played the leading female role, and the drama \"Playing Dead\" (1915), the Drews' only attempt at a \"serious\" film. \n\nIn 1916, the popular team was lured to Richard A. Rowland's and Louis B. Mayer's newly founded Metro company, where they continued to dominate in the field of marital comedy. During World War I, Sidney Drew's son, actor-director S. Rankin Drew, was killed in action. Drew never recovered from the loss. The team left Metro for personal appearances but was signed to V.B.K. Sidney Drew died suddenly on April 9, 1919. Lucile McVey Drew died in 1925 from cancer, at the age of 35.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "170348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170348", "title": "Poetry analysis", "text": "Poetry analysis\n\nPoetry analysis is the process of investigating a poem's form, content, structural semiotics and history in an informed way, with the aim of heightening one's own and others' understanding and appreciation of the work.\n\nThe words \"poem\" and \"poetry\" derive from the Greek \"poiēma\" (to make) and \"poieo\" (to create). That is, a poem is a \"made thing\": a creation; an artifact. One might think of a poem as, in the words of William Carlos Williams, a \"machine made of words\". Machines produce some effect, or do some work. They do whatever they are designed to do. The work done by this \"machine made of words\" is the effect it produces in the reader's mind. A reader analyzing a poem is akin to a mechanic taking apart a machine in order to figure out how it works.\n\nLike poetry itself, poetry analysis can take many forms, and be undertaken for many different reasons. A teacher might analyze a poem in order to gain a more conscious understanding of how the poem achieves its effects, in order to communicate this to his or her students. A writer learning the craft of poetry might use the tools of poetry analysis to expand and strengthen his or her own mastery. A reader might use the tools and techniques of poetry analysis in order to discern all that the work has to offer, and thereby gain a fuller, more rewarding appreciation of the poem.\n\nSimilarly, one can derive pleasure from two of the most fundamental tools in the poet's toolbox—meter and rhyme—without necessarily knowing a lot of terminology, as in this, the first stanza of Byron's \"The Destruction of Sennacherib\":\n\nByron's use of meter and rhyme is especially evident and rewarding when one reads the lines out loud. The lines have a powerful, rolling, and very evident rhythm, and they rhyme in a way that is impossible to ignore. In other words, the \"physicality\" of the language—how it sounds and feels—accounts for a large measure of the poem's effect. The poem does not have a deep, hidden, symbolic meaning. Rather, it is simply pleasurable to read, say, and hear.\n\nCritical terminology becomes useful when one attempts to account for \"why\" the language is pleasurable, and \"how\" Byron achieved this effect. The lines are not simply rhythmic: the rhythm is regular within a line, and is the same for each line. A poem having a regular rhythm (not all poems do) is said to follow a certain meter. In \"The Destruction of Sennacherib\", each line has the basic pattern of two unstressed syllables followed by a third stressed syllable, with this basic pattern being repeated four times in a line. Those basic patterns are called feet, and this particular pattern (weak weak STRONG) is called an anapest. A line with four feet is said to be in tetrameter (\"\", from the Greek for four). This poem has a pleasurable and appropriate rhythm, and that rhythm has a name: this poem is written in \"anapestic tetrameter\". (This process of analyzing a poem's rhythms is called scansion.) The poem also rhymes (not all poems do), and the rhymes follow a pattern (they do not have to). In this case, the rhymes come right next to each other, which emphasizes them, and therefore emphasizes the sound, the physical nature, of the language. The effect of the poem's language derives in part from Byron's choice of an appropriate pattern of rhyme (or rhyme scheme): these adjacent, rhyming lines are called couplets. The sound, the physical nature, of the language is also emphasized by alliteration, as in the repetition of \"s\" sounds in the third line: \"And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea\".\n\nPoems can have many forms. Some forms are strictly defined, with required line counts and rhyming patterns, such as the sonnet or limerick. Such poems exhibit closed form. Others (which exhibit open form) have less structure or, indeed, almost no apparent structure at all. This appearance, though, is deceptive: successful open form poems are informed throughout by organic structure which may resist formal description but is nonetheless a crucial element of the poem's effect on the reading mind.\n\nA poet writing in closed form follows a specific pattern, a specific design. Some designs have proven so durable and so suited to the English language that they survive for centuries and are renewed with each generation of poets (sonnets, sestinas, limericks, and so forth), while others come into being for the expression of one poem and are then set aside (Frost's \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\" is a good example).\n\nOf all closed forms in English prosody, none has demonstrated greater durability and range of expression than blank verse, which is verse that follows a regular meter but does not rhyme. In English, iambic pentameter is by far the most frequently employed meter. Among the many exemplary works of blank verse in English are Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" and most of the verse passages from Shakespeare's plays, such as this portion of a famous soliloquy from Hamlet:\n\nNote that Shakespeare does not rigidly follow a pattern of five iambs per line. Rather, most lines have five strong syllables, and most are preceded by a weak syllable. The meter provides a rhythm that informs the line: it is not an invariable formula.\n\nRhymed pairs of iambic pentameter lines form the heroic couplet. Two masters of the form are Alexander Pope and John Dryden. The form has proven especially suited to conveying wit and sardonic humor, as in the opening of Pope's \"An Essay on Criticism\".\n\nFourteen lines of iambic pentameter arranged in a more elaborate rhyme scheme form a sonnet. There are two major variants. The form originated in Italy, and the word derives from \"sonetto\", which is Italian for \"little song\". The Italian sonnet or Petrarchan sonnet follows a rhyme scheme of ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, ABBA ABBA CD CD CD, ABBA ABBA CCE DDE, or ABBA ABBA CDD CEE. In each of these, a group of eight lines (the octave) is followed by a group of six (the sextet). Typically, the octave introduces a situation, idea, or problem to which the sestet provides a response or resolution. For example, consider Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Sound of the Sea\":\n\nThe octave presents the speaker's experience of the sound of the sea, coming to him from some distance. In the sestet, this experience mutates into a meditation on the nature of inspiration and man's connection to creation and his experience of the numinous.\n\nEnglish has (proportionally) far fewer rhyming words than Italian. Recognizing this, Shakespeare adapted the sonnet form to English by creating an alternate rhyme scheme: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. The poet using this, the English sonnet or Shakespearean sonnet form, may use the fourteen lines as single unit of thought (as in \"The Silken Tent\" above), or treat the groups of four rhyming lines (the quatrains) as organizational units, as in Shakespeare's Sonnet 73:\n\nIn lines 1–4, the speaker compares his time of life to autumn. In lines 5–8, the comparison is to twilight; in lines 9–12, the comparison is to the last moments of a dying fire. Each quatrain presents a shorter unit of time, creating a sense of time accelerating toward an inevitable end, the death implied in the final couplet.\n\nAt the \"high end\" of closed forms are the sestina and villanelle. At the \"low end\" are forms such as the limerick, which follows a metrical pattern of two lines of anapestic trimeter (three anapests per line), followed by two lines of anapestic dimeter (two anapests per line), followed by one line of anapestic trimeter. (The beginning of the metrical foot does not have to coincide with the beginning of the line.) Any poem following this metrical pattern would generally be considered a limerick, however most also follow an AABBA rhyme scheme. Most limericks are humorous, and many are ribald, or outright obscene (possible rhymes that could follow an opening like \"There once was a man from Nantucket\" are left as an exercise for the reader). Nonetheless, the form is capable of sophisticated and playful expression:\n\nIn contrast, a poet using free verse (sometimes called \"open form\") seeks to find fresh and uniquely appropriate forms for each poem, letting the structure grow out of the poem's subject matter or inspiration. A common perception is that open form is easier and less rigorous than closed form (Frost likened it to \"playing tennis with the net down\"\n, but such is not necessarily the case (skeptics should \"try\" playing tennis without a net): success with the open form requires great sensitivity to language and a particular type of adaptable understanding. In the best open form poems, the poet achieves something that is inaccessible through closed form. As X. J. Kennedy has said, \"Should the poet succeed, then the discovered arrangement will seem exactly right for what the poem is saying\" (582). The metre of ‘classical’ poetry is replaced in open verse by cadence in rhythm, line indentation, with pauses implied by the syntax, thus the limiting factor of one human breath was naturally incorporated in the poetry, essential to an oral art form, composed to be read aloud.\n\nWalt Whitman was an important innovator of open form, and he demonstrates its merits in \"A Noiseless Patient Spider\".\n\nThe long, rolling lines—unified, held together like strong cords, by alliteration and assonance—partake of the same nature as the spider's filaments and the soul's threads. Two balanced stanzas, one describing a spider, the other the speaker's soul, perfectly frame the implicit comparison, with neither being privileged over the other. Just as the spider and the soul quest outward for significance, the two stanzas throw links to each other with subtly paired words: isolated/detached, launched/fling, tirelessly/ceaselessly, surrounding/surrounded.\n\nIn this poem, Whitman uses synonyms and antonyms to give structural integrity to a poem comprising two yoked stanzas, much like (but not exactly like) the way poets working within closed forms use meter and rhyme to give structural integrity to their poems. The form works quite well, but there is no established term that describes it. Rather, Whitman created this form so that he could write this poem. Conceivably, other poets could adopt the form, and repeated examples would give literary analysts the material they would need to specify its defining characteristics and give it a name. But, that hasn't happened. Instead, we have one poem that deploys a structure very well suited to its subject. The poem has form, but the form was not imposed by previous conventions. It has open form.\n\nMost poetry can be read on several levels. The surface is not necessarily the essence of the poem although in some cases (notably, the works of William McGonagall) there is little beyond the immediate. Allegory, connotation and metaphor are some of the subtler ways in which a poet communicates with the reader.\n\nBefore getting seduced into explorations of subtle nuance, however, the reader should establish the theme of the poem. What is the 'story' that is being told? Not the literal story but the heart of the poem. For example: \"Another\" tells of a buried child; \"The Destruction of Sennacherib\" tells of the annihilation of an Assyrian army by divine intervention; \"The Silken Tent\" compares a woman to a tent. Part of this involves recognising the voice of the poem (who is speaking), and the rest of Kipling's \"six honest serving men\": the events in the poem; when these occur; where is the 'speaker' and where do the events occur; why does the speaker speak? William Harmon has suggested that starting an analysis with: \"This poem dramatizes the conflict between ...\" is a key technique.\n\nGeorge Herbert in his poem \"Jordan (I)\" asks if poetry must be about the imaginary. The poem opens:\n\nHe was railing against the prevalent enthusiasm for pastoral poetry above all other forms (as becomes apparent in subsequent verses). Curiously, this verse uses metaphors to challenge the use of indirect approaches to their subject. False hair and a painted chair are decorations of the mundane. The winding stair is obstructive concealment of meaning. Herbert is criticising the overuse of allegory, symbolism or elaborate language.\n\nFor most poets—even the plain-speaking Herbert—metaphor is the fundamental means of communicating complexity succinctly. Some metaphors become so widely used that they are widely recognised symbols and these can be identified by using a specialist dictionary.\n\nAllegorical verse uses an extended metaphor to provide the framework for the whole work. It was particularly prevalent in seventeenth century English but a more recent example is Charles Williams' \"The Masque of the Manuscript\", in which the process of publishing is a metaphor for the search for truth. Allegories are usually readily apparent because of the heavy use of metaphor within them.\n\nThe symbolism used in a poem may not always be as overt as metaphor. Often the poet communicates emotionally by selecting words with particular connotations. For example, the word \"sheen\" in \"The Destruction of Sennacherib\" has stronger connotations of polishing, of human industry, than does the similar \"shine\". The Assyrians did not simply choose shiny metal; they worked to make it so. The word hints at a military machine.\n\nOther tropes that may be used to increase the level of allusion include irony, litotes, simile, and metonymy (particularly synecdoche).\n\nEnglish language poetic meter depends on stress, rather than the number of syllables. It thus stands in contrast to poetry in other languages, such as French, where syllabic stress is not present or recognized and syllable count is paramount. This often makes scansion (the analysis of metrical patterns) seem unduly arcane and arbitrary to students of the craft.\n\nIn the final analysis, the terms of scansion are blunt instruments, clumsy ways of describing the infinitely nuanced rhythms of language. Nonetheless, they provide a tool for discerning and describing the underlying structure of poems (especially those employing closed form).\n\nThe terms fall into two groups: the names of the different feet, and the names of the varying line lengths.\n\nThe most common feet in poetry written in English are the iamb (weak STRONG), the anapest (weak weak STRONG), the trochee (STRONG weak), and the dactyl (STRONG weak weak). The iamb and anapest are known as \"rising meters\" (they move \"up\" from weak to strong syllables); the trochee and dactyl are \"falling meters\" (they move \"down\" from strong to weak). Less common, but frequently important for the variety and energy they bring to a line, are the monosyllabic foot (weak) and the spondee (STRONG STRONG).\n\nThe terms for line length follow a regular pattern: a Greek prefix denoting the number of feet and the root \"meter\" (for \"measure\"): monometer, dimeter, trimeter, tetrameter, pentameter, hexameter, heptameter, and octameter (lines having more than eight feet are possible but quite rare).\n\nAnother useful term is caesura, for a natural pause within a line.\n\nMeter and line length are not formulas for successful lines of poetry. They are rough forms of notation for the many satisfying and variable rhythms of language. Slavish adherence to meter produces doggerel. Skillful poets structure their poems around a meter and line length, and then depart from it and play against it as needed in order to create effect, as Robert Browning does in the first line of \"My Last Duchess\":\n\nThe opening spondees, which throw the iambic line out of pattern, gives the Duke's words a certain virulent energy: he's spitting the words out.\n\nGerard Manley Hopkins took this idea of poetric energy through departure from meter to its extreme, with his theory and practice of sprung rhythm, an approach to poetry in which the language constantly frustrates the reading mind's expectation of a regular meter.\n\nAnalyzing diction and connotation—the meanings of words as well as the feelings and associations they carry—is a good place to start for any poem. The use of specific words in the poem serve to create a tone—an attitude taken towards the subject. For example, consider the words \"slither\" and \"sneak.\" When used in a poem, the words conjure up images of a snake. The sibilant \"s\" sound reinforces the image. The connotations of the words suggest something surreptitious and undercover. From the tone, one can infer that the author is suspicious or fearful of the subject.\n\nA detached tone, or an opposite tone than the reader would expect, are sometimes purposely employed to elicit more of a response. In the opening lines of \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", T. S. Eliot quickly sets a certain tone, and then creates effect by juxtaposing it with a very different tone:\n\nPoets such as E. E. Cummings experiment with punctuation and the words' layout on a page. In doing so, they venture into a realm of poetry that really cannot be read aloud: it can only be experienced through the eye.\n\nCummings has fractured language into its most atomic elements. To analyze the poem, the reader must first reassemble these into meaningful units: a brief, evocative image—\"a leaf falls\"—appearing, like an unbidden thought, in the middle of a word, \"loneliness\". A single falling leaf is by itself a fine image for the feeling of loneliness, but in order to fully experience the poem, the reader must then put the elements of language back into the visual form in which Cummings arranged them: a vertical line (like a leaf falling to the ground), followed by a horizontal series of letters (like a leaf laying flat on the ground). The vertical line is dominated by the word \"one\" (an absolutely appropriate expression of loneliness) and by the letter \"l\" (which, on the page, looks like the numeral 1... it looks like \"one\").\n\nNumerous other poets, including George Herbert, Lewis Carroll, William Blake, Wyndham Lewis, and John Hollander have used the layout of words, letters, and images on the page to create effect in their poems. An analytic reader of poetry must attend to the eye as well as the ear and the mind.\n\nThere are many different 'schools' of poetry: oral, classical, romantic, modernist, etc. and they each vary in their use of the elements described above.\n\nSchools of poetry may be self-identified by the poets that form them (such as Imagism), or defined by critics who see unifying characteristics of a body of work by more than one poet (for example The Movement). To be a 'school' a group of poets must share a common style or a common ethos. A commonality of form is not in itself sufficient to define a school; for example, Edward Lear, George du Maurier and Ogden Nash do not form a school simply because they all wrote limericks.\n\nPoetry analysis is almost as old as poetry itself, with distinguished practitioners going back to figures such as Plato. At various times and places, groups of like-minded readers and scholars have developed, shared, and promoted specific approaches to poetry analysis.\n\nThe New Criticism dominated English and American literary criticism from the 1920s to the early 1960s. The New Critical approach insists on the value of close reading and rejects extra-textual sources. The New Critics also rejected the idea that the work of a critic or analyst is to determine an author's intended meaning (a view formalized by W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley as the intentional fallacy). The New Critics prized ambiguity, and tended to favor works that lend themselves to multiple interpretations.\n\nReader Response developed in Germany and the United States as a reaction to New Criticism. It emphasises the reader's role in the development of meaning.\n\nReception aesthetics is a development of Reader Response that considers the public response to a literary work and suggests that this can inform analysis of cultural ideology at the time of the response.\n\nAll poetry was originally oral, it was sung or chanted; poetic form as we know it is an abstraction therefrom when writing replaced memory as a way of preserving poetic utterances, but the ghost of oral poetry never vanishes.\nPoems may be read silently to oneself, or may be read aloud solo or to other people. Although reading aloud to oneself raises eyebrows in many circles, few people find it surprising in the case of poetry.\n\nIn fact, many poems reveal themselves fully only when they are read aloud. The characteristics of such poems include (but are not limited to) a strong narrative, regular poetic meter, simple content and simple form. At the same time, many poems that read well aloud have none of the characteristics exhibited by T. S. Eliot's \"Journey of the Magi\", for example. Poems that read aloud well include:\n\n\nThis article is focused on poetry written in English and reflects anglophone culture. Other cultures have other poetic forms and differ in their attitudes towards poetry.\n\n\n\n"}

This type of ministry can have profoundly prophetic overtones but is still geared primarily for the benefit of God.\nThe second avenue in which prophetic dance or movement can be used is whereby the vehicle/person being used becomes the minister to and for the benefit of the people. Believers feel that dancing or any movement inspired by God can and will become His voice at that moment. They further subscribe to the belief that an experienced person not meaning in dance vocabulary but relationally with God can use this medium to heal, deliver and set people free from all types of sickness and disease.

Services include architecture, development management, engineering, interior design, landscape design, lead consultancy, master planning, product design, specialist advisory services, urban design. The network caters to a wide range of clients in sectors including mixed-use, education, healthcare, energy, residential, government and hospitality.\n\nFounded in 1956 by architects Robert Matthew and Stirrat Johnson-Marshall, RMJM’s first offices were based in London and Edinburgh. In its earlier years, RMJM designed in a functional, modern style, with Matthew and Johnson-Marshall being strong proponents of this in the United Kingdom.\n\nRMJM was founded by Stirrat Johnson-Marshall and Robert Matthew in 1956. The partnership began following Robert Matthew’s decision to hire Johnson-Marshall to manage the new London office of his architecture practice, which had been set up to oversee the construction of New Zealand House in Haymarket Road, London, described as \"London's most distinguished 1960s office block\".\n\nIn 1961, the firm took Tom Spaven, Kenneth Graham, Vernon Lee, John Richards, Chris Carter, and Alan Whiteman into partnership. As a result, the practice changed its name to RMJM & Partners. The change in name also marked a shift towards larger international projects; by 1967 the practice employed 350 members of staff between the Edinburgh and London offices.\n\nRMJM began to take on more projects as the need for public sector construction grew, expanding to include a Glasgow studio before extending its reach beyond the British borders.\nIn the late 1960s, the firm began working on projects in the United States. Further projects in the Middle East and Central Asia saw RMJM establish several more international studios in the following decades.\n\nOver the next 20 years, RMJM continued to expand and the firms modernist, functional style became a trademark. As RMJM moved further into the emerging markets of the Middle East, East Asia, and Africa, it began to establish more offices within the respective countries. In 2016, RMJM announced the creation of two \"PRO\" studios with the capacity to provide sector-specific services, known as RMJM Sport and RMJM Healthcare. Today, RMJM has studios in 25 countries.\n\nRMJM has been involved in a number of initiatives aimed at addressing issues within architecture. These include the Architecture for Everyone scheme, which aimed to provide opportunities to ethnic minorities looking to establish a career in architecture. The scheme was initiated in partnership with the Stephen Lawrence Trust, named after the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, who intended to study architecture at university. Other initiatives with the Architecture for Everyone enterprise include a £1m investment to encourage young graffiti artists to pursue a career in architecture.\nAfrica: Nairobi; Mombasa; Pretoria; Kampala; Dar es Salaam; Gaborone\nAmericas: New York City; Cordoba; São Paulo; Curitiba\nAsia: Shanghai; Shenzhen; Hong Kong; Kuala Lumpur; Tokyo; Karachi\nEurope: Prague; Barcelona; Edinburgh; Istanbul; Ankara; Rome; Belgrade; Zurich; Valletta\nMiddle East: Dubai; Abu Dhabi; Riyadh; Tehran \n\n"}
{"id": "1795886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795886", "title": "Record chart", "text": "Record chart\n\nA record chart, also called a music chart, is a ranking of recorded music according to certain criteria during a given period of time. Many different criteria are used in different charts, including record sales, the amount of radio airplay, and since the popularity of the Internet for music, the number of downloads and the amount of streaming activity.\n\nSome charts are specific to a particular musical genre and most to a particular geographical location (although download charts are not easily pinned down in this way). The most common period of time covered by a chart is one week with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts. Component charts have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.\n\nA \"chart hit\" is a recording, identified by its inclusion in a chart that uses sales or other criteria to rank popular releases, that ranks highly in popularity compared to other songs in the same time frame. \"Chart-topper\" and related terms (like \"number one\", \"No. 1 hit\", \"top of the charts\", \"chart hit\", and so forth) are widely used in common conversation and in marketing, and are loosely defined. Because of its value in promoting recording artists and releases, both directly to the consumer, and by encouraging exposure on radio, TV other media, chart positioning has long been a subject of scrutiny and controversy. Chart compilation methodology and data sources vary, ranging from \"buzz charts\" (based on opinions of various experts and tastemakers), to charts that reflect empirical data such as retail sales. Therefore, a \"chart-topper\" may be anything from an \"insiders' pick\" to a runaway seller. Most charts that are used to determine extant mainstream popularity rely on measurable data.\n\nRecord chart performance is inherently relative, as they rank songs, albums and records in comparison to each other at the same time, as opposed to music recording sales certification methods, which are measured in absolute numbers. Comparing the chart positions of songs at different times thus does not provide an accurate comparison of a song's overall impact. The nature of most charts, particularly weekly charts, also favors songs that sell very well for a brief period of time; thus, a song that is only briefly popular may chart higher than a song that sells more copies in the long range, but more slowly. As a result, a band's biggest hit single may not be its best-selling single.\n\nAccording to Joel Whitburn, the American trade publication \"Billboard\" introduced the Hot 100 on August 4, 1958. This was the first chart in the US to \"fully integrate the hottest-selling and most-played pop singles.\" From 1958 until 1991, \"Billboard\" compiled the chart from playlists reported by radio stations, and surveys of retail sales outlets. Before 1958, several charts were published, including \"Best Sellers in Stores\", \"Most Played by Jockeys\" (later revived under the name Hot 100 Airplay), and \"Most Played in Juke Boxes\", and, in later collations of chart hits, the record's highest placing in any of those charts was usually reported. On November 30, 1991, \"Billboard\" introduced a new method of determining the Hot 100, \"by a combination of actual radio airplay monitored electronically by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems (BDS), additional playlists from small-market stations, and actual point-of-sale information provided by Nielsen SoundScan.\" Until 1998, any songs placed on the chart had to be physically available as a single. The Hot 100 continues to be published.\n\nThere are several commonly used terms when referring to a music/entertainment chart or the performance of a release thereon.\n\nA \"new entry\" is a title which is making its début in that chart. This is applied to all charts, for instance a track which is outside the Top 40 but which later climbs into that level of the chart is considered to be a 'new entry' to the Top 40 that week. In most official charts, tracks have to have been on sale for a period of time in order to enter the charts; however, in some retailers' charts, new releases are included in charts as 'new entries' without a sales history in order to make them more visible to purchasers. A real \"new entry\" is a title that makes its chart début, no matter how many positions officially the chart actually is. In the UK the official published chart is a Top 100 although a new entry can take place between positions 101-200 (this is also true of the Billboard Hot 100, which has a \"bubbling under\" addendum for new songs that have not yet made the Hot 100). The Top 40 is only used for radio to shorten the play-lists.\n\nA \"re-entry\" is a track which has previously entered a chart falls out of that chart and then later re-appears in it. This may come about if a release is reissued or if there is a surge of interest in the track. Generally any repeat entry of a track into a chart is considered a re-entry, unless the later version of the track is a materially different recording or significantly repackaged (such as Michael Jackson's \"Thriller 25\"), where the release would normally be considered separate and thus a \"new\" entry.\n\nA \"climber\" is a release which is going higher in the chart week-on-week. Because chart positions are generally relative to each other on a week-to-week basis, a release does not necessarily have to increase sales week-to-week to be a climber, as if releases ahead of it decline in sales sufficiently they may slip below it. By the same metric, not all week-to-week sales increases result in a climber, if other releases improve by a sufficient amount to keep it from climbing. The term \"highest climber\" is used to denote the release making the biggest leap upwards in the chart that week. There is generally not an equivalent phrase for tracks going down the chart; the term \"faller\" is occasionally used, but not as widely as 'climber'.\n\nThe \"top 10\", \"top 20\" and so forth are used to determine the relative success of a release. For instance, a track may be referred to as a 'top 10 hit' if it reaches a position between 1 and 10 on the singles chart, as a 'top 20 hit' if it reaches between positions 1 and 20, and so on. The most commonly known chart is the 'top 40' widely used by the media in various territories, though it is common for longer lists to be produced for or by the music industry. For example, in the UK, the Official Charts Company produces a top 200, although various media only publish shorter lists.\n\nA \"one-hit wonder\" is an act that appears on the chart just once. The term \"true one-hit wonder\" was the term given by Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums (and also the Billboard book Top Pop Singles) is an act that has one number one hit and nothing else on the chart ever. If an act appears in some other form, (for example) a solo act that appears with a band or with other acts then these are taken separately.\n\n"}

The shrine takes the architectural form of a \"chasse\" or gabled casket; its more distant prototype is the gabled sarcophagus that was an established Romanesque convention in Northern Europe, \"a form which was quite fitting,\" Marvin Ross observed in discussing the similarly shaped gilt-copper and enamel reliquary of Saint Amand in the Walters Museum \"since these châsses were in a sense also tombs\". As with the prototypical tombs, a blind arcade runs along the base, forming niches with the protective seated figures of Apostles and Prophets. In its gable end St Eleutherius appears, holding his crozier in one hand and in the other a model of the cathedral with its five spires. \n\nThe shrine was made in Tournai or its immediate vicinity, once part of a prolific production that is now all but lost; it has been attributed to the workshop that was founded by Nicholas of Verdun, the leading goldsmith of Mosan art, who completed the reliquary of Our Lady in 1205. It is conserved in the Treasury of the cathedral of Tournai, housed in the former chapterhouse.\n\nTwo years following the completion of this reliquary, a separate one was made for the head of Saint Eleutherius, now lost with its contents.\n"}

Its mission is to include their contributions in the canon of American art history through acquisitions from its collection by major museums, as well as through exhibitions, programs, and publications. The Foundation derives its name from a 1921 poem by Langston Hughes (1902-67) titled \"The Negro Speaks of Rivers,\" the last line of which is \"My soul has grown deep like the rivers.\n\nThe Foundation is led by Maxwell L. Anderson, who serves as its President, and a member of its Board of Trustees. Anderson was previously director of the Dallas Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.\n\nThe Souls Grown Deep Foundation Collection contains over 1,100 works by more than 160 artists, two-thirds of whom are women. Ranging from large-scale assemblages to works on paper, the Foundation is particularly strong in works dating from the death of Martin Luther King, Jr. to the end of the twentieth century. The roots of these works can be traced to slave cemeteries and secluded woods. Following the Civil War, when the southern agrarian economy collapsed and rural African American sharecroppers and tenant farmers were forced to migrate for survival to major population centers—particularly in and around Birmingham, Alabama, where iron and steel production created jobs—a new and more public language of quilts, funerary, and yard arts arose. Beyond painting, sculpture, assemblage, drawing, and textile-making, this tradition also included music, dance, oral literature, informal theater, culinary arts, and more. Much like jazz musicians, the artists of this tradition reflect the rich, symbolic world of the black rural South through highly charged works that address a wide range of revelatory social and political subjects.\n\nAmong the artists represented are Thornton Dial, Lonnie Holley, Mary T. Smith, Joe Minter, Nellie Mae Rowe, Purvis Young, Emmer Sewell, Ronald Lockett, Joe Light, and the quiltmakers of Gee’s Bend.\n\nSouls Grown Deep Foundation was founded in 2010, but traces its roots to the mid-1980s, when William S. Arnett, an art historian and collector, began to collect the artworks of largely undiscovered African American artists across nine southeastern states. Developed outside of the structure of schools, galleries, and museums, these rich yet largely unknown African American visual art traditions present a distinct post–Civil Rights phenomenon that offers powerful insight and fresh perspectives into the most compelling political and social issues of our time. The majority of the works and ephemeral documents held by the Foundation were compiled by Arnett and his sons over three decades, with the goal of creating a collection that could serve as a record and legacy of this culture.\n\nBy the mid-1990s Arnett’s efforts culminated in an ambitious survey exhibition of this tradition titled \"Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art of the South\", presented in conjunction with the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and in partnership with the City of Atlanta and the Michael C. Carlos Museum of Emory University. The subsequent two-volume publication \"Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art of the South\", remains the most in-depth examination of the movement.\n\nSeveral exhibitions in recent years have drawn works primarily from the collection today in the care of the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, including \"The Quilts of Gee’s Bend\", organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston and the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2002, which traveled to the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Cleveland Museum of Art, Chrysler Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, High Museum of Art, and four other museums; \"Thornton Dial in the 21st Century\" at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston in 2006; \"Hard Truths: The Art of Thornton Dial\", organized by the Indianapolis Museum of Art in 2011, which traveled to the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Mint Museum, and the High Museum of Art; and \"Fever Within: The Art of Ronald Lockett\", organized by the Ackland Art Museum in 2016, which traveled to the American Folk Art Museum and the High Museum of Art.\n\nIn 2014 the Souls Grown Deep Foundation began a multi-year program to transfer the majority of works in its care to the permanent collections of leading American and international art museums. To date, this program has led to the acquisition of over 200 works by 75 artists from the Foundation’s collection by museums including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the High Museum of Art, the New Orleans Museum of Art, and the Ackland Art Museum, as well as multiple major exhibitions and publications including \"Revelations: Art from the African American South\" at the de Young Museum in San Francisco.\n"}

It was published in book form in 1851, and became an early Victorian classic which sold out three editions. In the \"Advertisement to the First Edition\", which prefaces it, it is called a fairy tale, one, it might be added, that illustrates the triumph of love, kindness, and goodness over evil; however, it could also be characterised as a fable, a fabricated origin myth and a parable. It was illustrated with 22 illustrations by Richard Doyle (1824–83). It was then illustrated by Arthur Rackham in 1932.\n\nThe richness of the Treasure Valley, high in the mountains of Stiria or Styria, southeastern Austria, is lost through the evil of the owners, the two elder, \"Black Brothers\", Hans and Schwartz, who in their foolishness mistreat Southwest Wind, Esquire, who in turn floods their valley, washing away their \"liquid assets\", and turning their valley into a dead valley of red sand.\n\nThis personified wind has the power to keep things this way through his influence with other winds that had caused the valley's unique fertility. Forced into a trade other than farming Hans and Schwartz become goldsmiths. They cruelly melt their younger brother Gluck's prize heirloom, a golden mug, which consists of the head of a golden bearded man. This action releases the King of the Golden River for Gluck to pour out of the crucible as a finely dressed little golden dwarf. The Golden River is one of the high mountain cataracts, that surround the Treasure Valley. Gluck fancies that it would be good if that high majestic river would actually be what it appears in the setting sun, a river of gold. The dwarfish king disagrees with Gluck, but offers a proposition: if someone were to climb up to the source of the river and throw into it at least three drops of \"holy water\", it would become for that person only a river of gold. That person must do it on his first and only attempt or be overwhelmed by the river to become a black stone.\n\nHans and Schwartz desire to take the challenge, duel each other with the result that Schwartz is thrown into jail for disturbing the peace. Hans, who had the good sense to hide from the constable, steals holy water from the church and climbs up the mountains to the Golden River. He has a hard time of it on a glacier and gets away without his provisions and only his flask of holy water. Overcome with thirst Hans is forced to drink from this flask, knowing that only three drops are all that's needed. Along the path, Hans comes across three prostrate individuals dying of thirst, a puppy, a fair child, and an old man. Hans satisfies his own thirst while denying the three needy individuals.\n\nThe \"demeanor\" of the surroundings of his journey turns bleak and inauspicious, climaxing in Hans being transformed into a black stone once he has hurled the holy water flask into the Golden River. Gluck secures the release of his brother Schwartz, who, buying his holy water from a \"bad priest\", eventually fares likewise, spurning in his turn the fair child, the old man, and his brother Hans lying prostrate in his path. The Golden River then acquires another black stone around which to rush and wail.\nGluck takes a turn at climbing the mountain. He encounters first an old man walking down the mountain trail who begs water from the flask. Gluck allows him to drink, leaving only a third of the holy water. He then encounters a fair child, lying by the road, whom he allows to drink all but a few drops. Following these unselfish acts, Gluck's path is made bright and pleasant making him feel better than he had in his whole life—no doubt, due to his kindness. He then comes across the prostrate puppy, whom he gives the final drops of the holy water. The puppy turns into the King of the Golden River, who tells Gluck the reason for the deadly fate of his two brothers: the water they had thrown into the river was made unholy by their denying it to those dying of thirst on the way. Thereupon, he shakes three drops of dew from a lily into Gluck's flask to throw into the river and then vanishes by evaporation. Gluck throws the dew drops into the Golden River, and it forms a whirlpool where it goes underground and then emerges in the Treasure Valley. The Treasure Valley becomes lush and fertile once again. Gluck the new owner is a wealthy man, who never turns away the needy from his door. Ever afterward, though, the people show and tell travellers the tale of the two black stones in the Golden River, known as The Black Brothers.\n\n\nThis fairy tale also has the character of an aetiological myth—a story devised to explain why things are as they are in the world. It is structured like an epic saga with each of the chapters closing on one solitary curiosity: Chapter One, the card identifying Southwest Wind, Esquire; Chapter Two, the mug becoming a released King of the Golden River; Chapter Three, Hans becoming a black stone; Chapter Four, Schwartz becoming a companion black stone; and Chapter Five, the black stones being known as the \"Black Brothers\".\n\nAnother view is that of Oliver Lodge, editor, of the Everyman's Library edition of the work: \"The parable is in two halves, a sort of Paradise Lost and a Paradise Regained—lost by selfishness, regained by love.\"\n\nWater is the force that makes and unmakes things. The Treasure Valley never fails to have the proper watering to be perpetually lush. It is then destroyed by the water of a torrential flood. It is restored through the water of the Golden River becoming for the kindhearted Gluck a river of gold. Water's power appears in the treacherous glacier, which frightens those who traverse it with its sounds of rushing water and cracking ice. Water as \"holy water\" causes the miraculous transformation of the Golden River into a \"river of gold\" at the behest of the king. The King of the Golden River himself disappeared through the process of evaporation, a \"water\" phenomenon.\n\nIn this fairy tale the environment responds positively or negatively to human good or evil. There is the interplay of personified forces of nature like winds and rivers.\n\nLodge also enlightens us as to the lesson learned by the Black Brothers becoming goldsmiths and Gluck's wish that the Golden River become a literal river of gold: \"And the restoration of wealth to Treasure Valley, by restoring the fertility of its soil instead of by metalliferous undertakings, is entirely in harmony with the author's consistent teaching that all true material increase must come from the soil\". Note that the King of the Golden River was imprisoned through \"metalliferous undertakings\".\n\nAs stated above, this story could also be classed as a fable by which John Ruskin can impart to his readers that love, kindness, and philanthropy could transform the world as it did the Treasure Valley. No doubt, he speaks through the King of the Golden River when he tells Gluck: \"the water which has been refused to the cry of the weary and dying is unholy, though it had been blessed by every saint in heaven; and the water which is found in the vessel of mercy is holy, though it had been defiled with corpses\".\n\n"}

The controversial installation consists of a Confederate flag hanging from a noose at a 13-foot gallows. \"The Proper way to Hang a Confederate Flag\" was first shown in Schmucker Gallery at Gettysburg College in 2004 as a part of Sims' \"Recoloration Proclamation: The Gettysburg Redress\". \"Recoloration Proclamation\" targets specific traditional symbols of southern heritage, which are inextricably linked to slavery and racism in America. Included in the exhibition are recolored Confederate flags, a Confederate flag hanging from the gallows, a contemporary rewrite of the Gettysburg Address, contemporary recordings of the song \"Dixie\", and a documentary film. A notable piece featured in the exhibition \"Recoloration Proclamation: The Gettysburg Redress\" is \"ReVote,\" an installation featuring three voting booths used in Florida's disputed 2000 presidential election with re-colored Confederate flags hanging above, including black, red, and green for the Pan-African Flag of the African Liberation Movement. Pink and lavender Confederate flags with feathers and sequins were also created for the exhibition signifying \"drag flags\". John Sims received national media attention for his lynching of the Confederate flag.\n\nA related exhibition, Dread Scott's interactive installation \"What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?\" was first shown at The Art Institute of Chicago in 1989. Scott's piece became the center of national controversy over its use of the American flag. Dread Scott's piece begins with a photomontage of American flags draped over coffins as well as South Korean citizens burning American flags while protesting American foreign policy. The question, \"What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. flag?\" is written across the images. The photomontage hangs above a table where exhibit visitors are invited to write their answers to Scott's question in a blank book. A three by five foot American flag is placed on the ground in front of the table, and if visitors want to write in the book, they must first step on the flag. \"What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?\" joined Sims' \"The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag\" in Sarasota, Fl at the Crossley Gallery in 2006.\n\nSchmucker Gallery Gettysburg, PA 2004\n\nGeorgia State University Atlanta, GA 2005\n\nCrossley Gallery Sarasota, FL 2006\n\nBowery Poetry Club New York, NY 2006\n\nBrogan Museum Tallahassee, FL 2007\n\nKennedy Museum of Art, Ohio University, Athens OH 2017\n\nSchmucker Gallery Gettysburg, PA 2004 :The lynching exhibit was initially set to be installed outdoors in front of Schmucker Gallery at Gettysburg College, and would have remained open to the public for three weeks. Sons of Confederate Veterans, Gettysburg Battlefield Preservation Association (GBPA), and other members of the community objected strongly to the exhibition. Detractors interpreted the exhibit as anti-southern heritage. Sims wrote about his motivation, \"...Our sense of history is segregated, our social identity is fractured and our vocabularies for discussing race, symbols and respect are bare.\" Ultimately, Gettysburg College administration changed the location and duration of the exhibit. \"The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag\" was installed inside of Schmucker Gallery. John Sims boycotted the exhibition.\n\nGeorgia State University Atlanta, GA 2005 :\n\"The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag\" was shown in a group show, \"Potentially Harmful: The Art of American Censorship\". The group exhibition examines the role of artistic controversy in shaping a free society. Through two exhibitions, presentations of spoken word and performance artists, artists' talks, panel discussions, a film screening and a series of legal seminars, this project reflects an environment that nurtures contentious art. Artists included in the exhibition are Lynda Benglis, Critical Art Ensemble, Sue Coe, Benita Carr, Alex Donis, Karen Finley, Eric Fischl, Tom Forsythe, John Jota Leaños, Gayla Lemke, Alma Lopez, Robert Mapplethorpe, Carolee Scheemann, Dread Scott, Andres Serrano, Elizabeth Sisco, Louis Hock, David Avalos, John Sims, John Anthony Trobaugh, Pat Ward Williams, Nancy Worthington, Marilyn Zimmerman, and The File.\n\nCrossley Gallery Sarasota, FL 2006 :\n\"The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag\" was shown at Ringling College of Art and Design in the Crowley Gallery alongside Dread Scott's \"What is the Proper Way to Hang a U.S. Flag?\":\n\nBowery Poetry Club New York, NY 2006 :\n\"Recoloration Proclamation: The New York City Hangings\" was the title of the New York City exhibition.

The flag was ritually hung from a 13-foot gallows in a symbolic act of judgment against the history of white supremacy. Following this performance event, the flag was carried to the Kennedy Museum of Art and installed in the exhibition \"Expression and Repression: Contemporary Art Censorship in America\" as \"The Proper Way to Hang a Confederate Flag.\" The exhibition also featured Kara Walker, Sue Coe and David Wojnarowicz, and was on view through December 22, 2017.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "84957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84957", "title": "Theodor Fontane", "text": "Theodor Fontane\n\nTheodor Fontane (; 30 December 1819 – 20 September 1898) was a German novelist and poet, regarded by many as the most important 19th-century German-language realist writer. His well-known novel \"Effi Briest\" is still widely read in English-speaking countries.\n\nFontane was born in Neuruppin, a town 30 miles northwest of Berlin, into a Huguenot family. At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to an apothecary, his father's profession. He became an apothecary himself, and in 1839, at the age of 20, wrote his first work (\"Heinrichs IV. erste Liebe\", now lost). His further education was in Leipzig, where he came into contact with the progressives of the Vormärz.\n\nFontane's first published work, the novella \"Geschwisterliebe\" (Sibling Love), appeared in the \"Berlin Figaro\" in December 1839. His biographer Gordon A. Craig observes that this gave few indications of his promise as a gifted writer: \"Although the theme of incest, which was to occupy Fontane on later occasions, is touched upon here, the mawkishness of the tale... is equalled by the lameness of its plot and the inertness of the style in which it is told, and [the characters] Clärchen and her brother are both so colorless that no one could have guessed that their creator had a future as a writer.\"\n\nFontane's first job as apothecary was in Dresden, after which he returned to his father's shop in the provincial town of Letschin in the Oderbruch region. Fleeing its provincial atmosphere, Fontane published articles in the Leipzig newspaper \"Die Eisenbahn\" and translated Shakespeare. In 1843, he joined a literary club in Berlin called Tunnel über der Spree (Tunnel over the River Spree) where he came into contact with many of the most renowned German writers, including Theodor Storm, Joseph von Eichendorff and Gottfried Keller.\n\nIn 1844 Fontane enlisted in the Prussian army and set out on the first of numerous journeys to England, which fostered his interest in Old English ballads, a form he began to imitate. He became engaged to his future wife, Emilie Rouanet-Kummer, whom he had met when still at school.\n\nHe briefly participated in the revolutionary events of 1848. In 1849 he quit his job as an apothecary and became a full-time journalist and writer. In order to support his family, he took a job as a writer for the Prussian intelligence agency \"Zentralstelle für Presseangelegenheiten\", which was intended to influence the press towards the German nationalist cause. There he specialized in British affairs, and the agency made him for several years its correspondent in London, where he was later joined by his wife and two sons. While still in London, he quit his government job, and on his return to Berlin became editor of the conservative paper \"Neue Preussische Zeitung\". As a man of liberal sympathies, Fontane ruefully wrote to a friend about his job with the \"Zeitung\": \"I sold myself to the reaction for thirty pieces of silver a month...These days one cannot survive as an honest man.\"\n\nFontane's books about Britain include \"Ein Sommer in London\" (A Summer in London, 1854), \"Aus England, Studien und Briefe\" (From England: Studies and Letters, 1860) and \"Jenseit des Tweed, Bilder und Briefe aus Schottland\" (Beside the Tweed, Pictures and Letters from Scotland, 1860). The success of the historical novels of Walter Scott had helped to make British themes much in vogue on the Continent. Fontane's \"Gedichte\" (Poems, 1851) and ballads \"Männer und Helden\" (Men and Heroes, 1860) tell of Britain's former glories.\n\nBack in Germany, Fontane became particularly interested in his home province, the March of Brandenburg. He enjoyed rambling through its rural landscapes and small towns and delighted in the growth of its capital city, Berlin. His fascination with the countryside surrounding Berlin may be seen in his picturesque \"Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg\" (Walks through the Province of Brandenburg, 1862–82, 5 vols.), in which he transposed his former fascination with British historical matters to his native soil.\n\nIn 1870, he quit his job at the \"Kreuzzeitung\" and became drama critic for the liberal \"Vossische Zeitung\", a position he held until retirement. He had already written about Prussia's war against Denmark in \"Der schleswig-holsteinische Krieg im Jahre 1864\" (1866) and the Austro-Prussian War in \"Der deutsche Krieg von 1866\" (1869). He went to the front to observe the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and after being taken prisoner at Vaucouleurs, remained in French captivity for three months. He set down his experiences in \"Kriegsgefangen Erlebtes 1870\" (Experiences as a Prisoner of War, 1871) and published his observations on the campaign in \"Der Krieg gegen Frankreich 1870–71\" (The War against France, 1870–71, published 1874–76). In his observations, he vociferously critiqued Prussian militarism: \"The mere glorification of the military, without moral content and elevated aim, is nauseating.\"\n\nAt the age of 57 Fontane finally set to work in the genre for which he is remembered: the novel. A fine historical romance, \"Vor dem Sturm\" (\"Before the Storm\", 1878) was followed by a series of novels of modern life, notably \"L'Adultera\" (\"Woman Taken in Adultery\", 1882), which was considered so risqué that it took Fontane two years to find it a publisher.\nIn his novels \"Irrungen, Wirrungen\" (\"Trials and Tribulations\", 1888), \"Frau Jenny Treibel\" (1892) and \"Effi Briest\" (1894–95), he found his own tone, yielding insights into the lives of the nobility and of the common man. His achievement there was later described as poetic realism. In \"Der Stechlin\" (written 1895–97), his last completed novel, Fontane adapted the realistic methods and social criticism of contemporary French fiction to the conditions of Prussian life.\n\nFontane died on September 20, 1898, in Berlin. As a member of the French Protestant Church of Berlin, he was buried in the congregation's cemetery on the Liesenstraße. His wife, Emilie, was buried beside him four years later. Their graves were damaged in World War II but later restored.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10681572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10681572", "title": "Yōga", "text": "Yōga\n\nEuropean painting was introduced to Japan during the late Muromachi period along with Christian missionaries. Early religious works by Japanese artists in imitation of works brought by the missionaries can be considered some of the earliest forms of \"Yōga\". However, the policy of national seclusion introduced by the Tokugawa bakufu in the Edo period effectively ended the influence of western art on Japanese painting, with the exception of the use of perspective, which was discovered by Japanese artists in sketches found in European medical and scientific texts imported from the Dutch via Nagasaki.\n\nIn 1855, the Tokugawa \"bakufu\" established the \"Bansho Shirabesho,\" a translation and research institute for western studies, including a section to investigate western art. This section was headed by Kawakami Togai, whose assistant Takahashi Yuichi was a student of English artist Charles Wirgman. Takahashi is regarded by many as the first true Yōga painter.\n\nIn 1876, the \"Kobu Bijutsu Gakko\" (Technical Art School) was established by the Meiji government as Japan's first dedicated \"Yōga\" art school. Foreign advisors, such as the Italian artist Antonio Fontanesi, were hired by the government to teach Japanese artists, such as Asai Chu in the latest western techniques.\n\nIn the 1880s, the general reaction against Westernization and the growth in popularity and strength of the \"Nihonga\" movement caused the temporary decline of \"Yōga\". The \"Kobu Bijutsu Gakko\" was forced to close in 1883, and when the \"Tokyo Bijutsu Gakko\" (the forerunner of the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music) was established in 1887, only \"Nihonga\" subjects were taught.\n\nHowever, in 1889, the \"Meiji Bijutsukai\" (Meiji Fine Arts Society) was established by \"Yōga\" artists, and in 1893, the return of Kuroda Seiki from his studies in Europe gave fresh impetus to the \"Yōga\" genre. From 1896, a Yōga department was added to the curriculum of the \"Tokyo Bijutsu Gakko\", and from that point onwards, \"Yōga\" has been an accepted component of Japanese painting.\n\nSince that time, \"Yōga\" and \"Nihonga\" have been the two main divisions of modern Japanese painting. This division is reflected in education, the mounting of exhibitions, and the identification of artists. However, in many cases \"Nihonga\" artists also adopted realistic Western painting techniques, such as perspective and shading. Because of this tendency to synthesize, although \"Nihonga\" forms a distinct category within the Japanese annual \"Nitten\" exhibitions, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to draw a distinct separation in either techniques or materials between \"Nihonga\" and \"Yōga\".\n\n\"Yōga\" in its broadest sense encompasses oil painting, watercolors, pastels, ink sketches, lithography, etching and other techniques developed in western culture. However, in a more limited sense, \"Yōga\" is sometimes used specifically to refer to oil painting.\n\n\n"}
