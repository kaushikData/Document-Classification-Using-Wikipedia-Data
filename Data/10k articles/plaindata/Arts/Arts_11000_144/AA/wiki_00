While similar to the general movement of Orientalism in its negative outlook upon Western Asian - especially Arab - culture and religion, it differs in both its emphasis upon the role of the Arab slave trade and the Coolie slave trade in the historic dialogue between sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab - and greater Muslim - world, as well as a lack of colonial promotion over the Middle East region as was promoted by European orientalism in the same region. The term \"black orientalism\" was first used by Kenyan academic Ali Mazrui in his critique of Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s documentary \"Wonders of the African World\". Supporters of this movement include writers such as Chinweizu.\n\nBlack orientalism, prior to its appropriation by religious Christian black nationalists, was formulated within the context of Afrocentrism; Jackson later wrote that it was Molefi Kete Asante who formed the base of its black orientalism:\nAdoption of Islam is as contradictory to the Diasporan Afrocentricity as Christianity has been. Christianity has been dealt with admirably by other writers, notably Karenga; but Islam within the African- American community ha [sic] yet to come under Afrocentric scrutiny. Understand that this oversight is due more to a sympathetic audience than it is to the perfection of Islam for African-Americans. While the Nation of Islam under the leadership of Elijah Muhammad was a transitional nationalist movement, the present emphasis of Islam in America is more cultural and religious. --Molefi Kete Asante, \"Afrocentricity\" (1988)\n\nThe term \"black orientalism\" was first used by Kenyan academic Ali Mazrui in his Internet critique of Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s documentary \"Wonders of the African World\". Mazrui had criticized the film for having markedly deemphasized the history of Islam in Africa, to the point where the history of Nigeria - half of whose population is Muslim - was all but absent from the general coverage by the documentary. The term was later used by Sherman Jackson in an article for \"Islamica Magazine\", which criticized Black orientalism as a backlash from the oft-conservative Christian African studies scholars who have seen Black Islam as a political threat of sorts. The article was later included in his book \"Islam and the Blackamerican\".\n\n"}

The treasure principally consists of silver tableware and jewellery, most of which is now held at the British Museum.\n\nThe hoard was unearthed in the nineteenth century at the Hill of St Louis in Carthage, which at the time of its deposition was the largest city of Africa Proconsulare. Most of the treasure was purchased by Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks, a senior curator at the British Museum, who bequeathed it to the museum upon his death in 1897. However, a small part of the treasure can be found in the Louvre, including one of the silver covered bowls.\n\nDating to the second half of the fourth century AD, the Carthage Treasure comprises 31 different objects, primarily luxury silver tableware and jewellery that must have belonged to a wealthy Roman family who for some reason decided to bury it for safe-keeping. This may have been because of the religious feud around the year 400 but it is more likely that the treasure was hidden from the Vandals. The Vandals, led by Gaiseric, invaded Africa Proconsulare from Spain in 429 and in 439 the city became capital of the Vandal Kingdom. Inscribed in the centre of one of the dishes around the tondo is D D ICRESCONI CLARENT, which is associated with the Cresconii, a powerful Roman North African family in Carthage who are well known from deeds and records of office-holders at this time.\n\nThe treasure includes a pair of flat dishes (one of which identifies the family), two bowls with chased and hammered pastoral scenes in relief around the edge, four hemispherical bowls with high tapering feet (two of which still have their covers), a shallow bowl with handle and frog engraved in the centre, twelve silver spoons, and a mixed collection of jewellery: a finger ring, a cameo, a pair of ear rings, several intaglios and two necklaces, one made of gold, the other with precious stones. The jewelled necklace consists of twelve polygonal emeralds, thirteen sapphires, matched by twenty five pearls all joined by gold links.\n\nThe family would have owned two collections of silver: One known as \"argentum potorium\" that was the drinking set and another for eating called the \"argentum escarium\". Amongst this find were several silver hemispherical lidded bowls that measure 12 cm high and 12 cm in diameter. The vessels' elegant design includes a tall base that complements the knop of the bowl's lid. The bowls also incorporate subtle facets on the lids' curved surfaces. Similar bowls have been found at the Roman site of Viminacium near the modern town of Kostolac in Serbia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54894153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54894153", "title": "Cold North Killers: Canadian Serial Murder", "text": "Cold North Killers: Canadian Serial Murder\n\nCold North Killers: Canadian Serial Murder is a 2012 Canadian non-fiction book written by Lee Mellor and published by Dundurn Press. It documents the lives of sixty Canadian serial killers, with the earliest being Edward H. Rulloff and the most recent being Russell Williams. The book uses Katherine Ramsland's interpretation of what constitutes a serial killer—someone who has killed at least two people on two separate occasions, and who attempted to or likely would have killed again—as outlined in her 2007 book \"The Human Predator\". \"Cold North Killer's\" own definition of what constitutes a Canadian serial killer includes both Canadians who committed murder abroad (such as Keith Hunter Jesperson and Gordon Stewart Northcott) and non-Canadians who committed murder in Canada (like William Dean Christenson and Earle Nelson).\n\nWhile bedridden with illness in 2009, Mellor occupied his time by writing a novel about an RCMP criminal profiler's hunt for a serial killer terrorizing Canada, but partway into the story, Mellor realized that he had very little knowledge of any actual Canadian serial killers beyond Clifford Olson, Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka, and Robert Pickton. While looking up other cases, Mellor, inspired by both the lack of a single comprehensive source regarding serial murder in Canada and the high-profile arrest of Russell Williams in 2010, decided to abandon his original idea for a book in favor of new one, an encyclopedia about serial homicide in Canada.\n\nMellor researched seventy-five cases for the book, but at the behest of the editors at Dundurn Press reduced the number of them included in it to sixty due to spatial constraints. Mellor later included two of the excised cases—the Montreal child murders of 1981-92 and the \"Headless Valley\" murders 1908-46—in the third issue of his online magazine \"Serial Killer Quarterly\".\n\nEach of the book's four sections cover different aspects of serial murder, and are divided into chapters that are each about a different Canadian serial killer. In-between each section are passages relating to Russell Williams, who was active and arrested in the same area where Mellor was residing while he was in the process of writing \"Cold North Killers\".\n\nThe first section showcases four of Canada's earliest serial killers—Edward H. Rulloff, Joseph LaPage, Theodore Durrant, and Gordon Stewart Northcott—and then delves into the nature versus nurture debate by scrutinizing the lives of Russell Johnson, Doug Moore, Peter Woodcock, and Clifford Olson. Modus operandi and signature crime are then discussed by looking into the crimes committed by Léopold Dion, William Patrick Fyfe, Earle Nelson, Serge Archambault, Sam Pirrera, and William Dean Christenson, with victimology then being explored through examination of John Martin Crawford, Donald Sherman Staley, and Allan Legere, as well as the unsolved Toronto gay village murders of 1967-68 and the Highway of Tears murders of 1969-2011.\n\nThe next section begins with a focus on the three different categories of serial killer: organized, disorganized, and mixed (someone who displays both organized and disorganized traits). Angelo Colalillo and David Threinen are used as examples of organized offenders, Braeden Nugent and Carl Hall as examples of disorganized offenders, and Donald Armstrong and Danny Wood as examples of mixed offenders. Next, sub-categories are explored, beginning with \"visionary\" killer Bruce Hamill followed by \"missionary\" killer Ronald Sears, and then the three varieties of \"hedonist\" killer; Henry Williams and Christian Magee are presented as instances of \"hedonist-lust\" killers, James Greenidge and Michael Wayne McGray as \"hedonist-thrill\" killers, and insurance fraudsters Charles Kembo and Sukhwinder Dhillon, \"black widow\" Melissa Ann Shepard, and baby farmers Lila and William Young as \"hedonist-comfort\" killers. After chapters on \"power/control\" killers David Snow and Keith Hunter Jesperson, the section concludes with passages on \"angels of death\" Thomas Neill Cream and Robert MacGregor.\n\nThe third section centers around techniques that are used by the authorities to help them investigate serial killers. Offender profiling was employed in the Brian Arp, Paul Bernardo, and the still-unsolved Edmonton serial killer cases, while advances in DNA analysis resulted in cold case murders being positively attributed to Ronald West, Gerald Thomas Archer, and Alan Craig MacDonald. Crime-solving methods pioneered by Canada are then showcased; metal detectors were used to uncover Michael Vescio's discarded shell casings in what was the first instance of the devices being used to assist with a criminal investigation, while bite-mark analysis was used to help convict Wayne Boden in what was one of the earliest usages of forensic dentistry in North America. In 1998, Kim Rossmo used geographic profiling to discern the presence of a serial killer operating in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Rossmo's data, which the Vancouver Police Department refused to look into, was later vindicated by the arrest of Robert Pickton in 2002.\n\nThe first half of the book's final section is dedicated to discussing violence against Canadian sex workers, and how many of their deaths seemingly go unreported and under-investigated, possibly due to both their profession and the fact that many of them are Aborogine. The cases examined here are all unsolved ones, and include the Hemlock Valley murders of 1995, the Calgary prostitute murders of 1991-93, the Prostitutes-in-the-Lake killings of 1994-97, and the Niagara prostitute murders of 1995-2006. The second half of the section presents six cases (Karla Homolka, Allan Sweeney, Melvin Stanton, Paul Cecil Gillis, Michael Hector, and Gilbert Paul Jordan) that Mellor regards as having been notably \"botched\" in some way, such as through investigative, judicial, or bureaucratic incompetence, apathy, or red tape. The concluding chapter consists of brief write-ups on Noel Winters, Allan George Foster, Paul Alan Hachey, Raymond Russell, Donald Falkner, Davey Mato Butorac, Camille Cleroux, Cody Legebokoff, and Mark Garfield Moore, all offenders who did not receive longer entries in the book due to either a lack of easily accessible information about their crimes, or because the murders that they committed were only unearthed while the book was undergoing its final editing phase.\n\nThe Vancouver Public Library sent their copy of \"Cold North Killers\" to the hate-speech squad at the Vancouver Police Department for analyses in 2013 after receiving complaints about its content from a concerned citizen, who wrote, \"There is no educational benefit in introducing a 10-year-old child who might pick this book up... to the ideas contained in it.\" The authorities concluded that there was nothing illegal about the book's content, and the Vancouver Public Library subsequently issued the formal statement, \"This work is disturbing to read, but this does not affect the library's obligation to protect the right of a citizen to read this book.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "25130945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25130945", "title": "Cross of Justin II", "text": "Cross of Justin II\n\nThe Cross of Justin II (also known as Crux Vaticana, Latin for \"Vatican Cross\") is a processional cross dating from the sixth century that is kept in the Treasury in St. Peter's Basilica, in Vatican City. It is also a one of the oldest surviving claimed reliquaries of the True Cross, if not the oldest. It is a \"crux gemmata\" or jewelled cross, silver-gilt and adorned with jewels in gold settings, given to the people of Rome by the Roman Emperor Justin II, who reigned from 565 to 578, and his co-ruler and wife, the Empress Sophia. \n\nThe cross bears a Latin inscription reading: \"ligno quo Christus humanum subdidit hostem dat Romae Iustinus opem et socia decorem\" which is commonly mistranslated as \"For the wood [of the cross] with which human Christ was overcome by the enemy, Justin [and his consort?] give Rome this wealth and decoration\" A more accurate reading is: \"With the wood with which Christ conquered man's enemy, Justin gives his help to Rome and his wife offers the ornamentation.\" To mark the end of restoration and conservation work on the cross, it was placed on display in the main Basilica of Saint Peter's from November 2009 to April 12, 2010.\n\nThe original portion of the cross, which is now mounted on a much later stand, is 15.75 inches high and 11.81 inches wide, excluding the spike at the bottom for fitting into its stand. The cross was restored in 2009; it has been altered and restored at several points in its history, including reducing its size.\n\nThe front of the cross has no figurative images: in the centre is a medallion containing the relic, which is itself displayed as cross-shaped. The centres of the arms carry the inscriptions, and the edges of the arms jewels in set in gold, with four jewels hanging from the arms as pendilia. The reverse side is decorated in repoussé silver, and shows an interesting transitional stage in the decoration of the cross. At the period the church was starting to encourage representation of the human figure of Christ on the cross, making a crucifix, which had previously not been usual. The central medallion shows the Lamb of God, a common older formula. Above and below this are images in medallions of Christ (the lower one may be John the Baptist instead). The upper one shows Christ holding a book, representing the Gospels, which was to become a standard feature of the image of Christ Pantocrator; in the lower one Christ or John has a blessing gesture. At the ends of the arms, where the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist would often be found in later crucifixes, are instead portraits in medallions of Justin and his empress Sophia. Between the medallions there are decorative foliage scrolling motifs, on the upright centred on onion-like plants probably intended as palm-trees.\n\nIn 569, Justin and Sophia together reportedly sent a relic of the True Cross to the Frankish princess Radegund, who founded a monastery at Poitiers to house it. The event was commemorated in \"Vexilla Regis\" by Venantius Fortunatus. They are also recorded as sending relics to Pope John III (reigned 561-574) in an attempt to improve relations – the Crux Vaticana very likely dates from John's reign, perhaps around 568 or 569. Older scholars thought, mainly on the basis of imperial head-dress, that Justin I (r. 518-27) and his empress Euphemia were the donors, but this view seems now rejected.\n\n\n"}

In 2002 DTW opened its new Doris Duke Performance Center, which contains the 192-seat Bessie Schönberg Theatre.\n\nFrom 1975-2003, DTW was led by David R. White, Executive Director and Producer. Under White's leadership, DTW became one of the most influential contemporary performing arts centers and artist incubators in the United States and abroad, responsible for identifying and nurturing some of the most important dance and other performing artists of our time, including: Bill T.

Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company to become New York Live Arts. The move was prompted by a need for financial security, with the dance company coming in as the more financially secure organization of the two – DTW took on a considerable amount of debt in building its new facility.\n\nMore than 200 concerts and exhibits by some 70 contemporary dance, theater, music, visual and video artists were sponsored annually by Dance Theater Workshop.\n\nSuch notable artists as Mark Morris, David Gordon, Bill T.

They met to discuss the rapidly disappearing practitioners of these trades, including those of the shop, farm, sea, and home. They were concerned about the loss of the skills and knowledge of the tools and practices of those trades and wanted to do something to preserve them. Their solution was the formation of the EAIA, subsequently incorporated on March 16, 1942, as a nonprofit educational organization interested in all aspects of the mechanical arts in America.\n\nThe work of the EAIA is funded through support from over 2,000 members across the USA and abroad and revenue earned through sales of publications, merchandise, and programs. These resources enable the EAIA to preserve and present historic trades, crafts, and tools and to interpret their impact on our lives.\n\nThe association immediately commenced publication of a quarterly journal, The Chronicle, which publishes articles on a broad variety of subjects within their fields of interest. Over the years they have issued occasional publications, reprinting important texts and disseminating historical documents and images. Recent publications include the \"Directory of American Toolmakers\", \"A Pattern Book of Tools and Household Goods\", and a CD-ROM comprising the first 60 volumes of The Chronicle.\n\nThe EAIA holds an annual meeting, usually held at a major museum with related interests, at which there are programs by members including talks, demonstrations, displays and tool exchanges. There are also regional meetings around the country providing smaller, more accessible versions of the annual meeting.\n\nSince 1978 the EAIA has made over 100 research grants to support original research, publication, and exhibitions related to their mission. For more than a decade a week-long program of workshops have taken place in cooperation with Eastfield Village, East Nassau, NY, at which participants are introduced to a number of traditional trades. There is also an annual \"Tool Tour\" to Europe focused on museums, sites, and collections related to the history of the mechanical arts.\n\nTestimony to the effectiveness of the EAIA may be found in many publications, including:\n\n"}

A film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.\n\nThe film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the film's budget.\n\nThere are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.\n\nA film director's task is to envisage a way to translate a screenplay into a fully formed film, and then to realize this vision. To do this, they oversee the artistic and technical elements of film production. This entails organizing the film crew in such a way to achieve their vision of the film. This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast-paced environment of a film set. Moreover, it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew, thus, excellent communication skills are a must.\n\nSince the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, he or she also needs to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary. Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film. The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as \"a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure\". It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again, if at all.\n\nGenerally, the sole superiors of the director are the producer(s) and the studio that is financing the film. The role of a director differs from producers in that producers typically manage the logistics and business operations of the production, whereas the director is tasked with making creative decisions. The director must work within the restrictions of the film's budget and the demands of the producer and studio (such as the need to get a particular age rating).\n\nDirectors also play an important role in post-production. While the film is still in production, the director sends \"dailies\" to the film editor and explains his or her overall vision for the film, allowing the editor to assemble an editor's cut. In post-production, the director works with the editor to edit the material into the director's cut. Well-established directors have the \"final cut privilege\", meaning that they have the final say on which edit of the film is released. For other directors, the studio can order further edits without the director's permission.\n\nThe director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one. It has been said that \"20-hour days are not unusual\". Some directors also take on additional roles, such as producing, writing or editing.\n\nUnder European Union law, the film director is considered the \"author\" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory. Auteur theory is a film criticism concept that holds that a film director's film reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary \"auteur\" (the French word for \"author\"). In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.\n\nSome film directors started as screenwriters, film editors or actors. Several American cinematographers have become directors, including Barry Sonnenfeld, originally the Coen brothers' DP; Jan de Bont, cinematographer on films as \"Die Hard\" and \"Basic Instinct\", directed \"Speed\" and \"Twister\". Wally Pfister, cinematographer on Christopher Nolan's three Batman films made his directorial debut with \"Transcendence\". Other film directors have attended a film school to \"get formal training and education in their craft\". Film students generally study the basic skills used in making a film. This includes, for example, preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, and reading scripts. Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post-production facilities. Besides basic technical and logistical skills, students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production. A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying. Future directors usually complete short films during their enrollment. The National Film School of Denmark has the student's final projects presented on national TV. Some film schools retain the rights for their students' works. Many directors successfully prepared for making feature films by working in television. The German Film and Television Academy Berlin consequently cooperates with the Berlin/Brandenburg TV station RBB (Berlin-Brandenburg Broadcasting) and ARTE.\n\nA handful of top directors made from $133.3 million to $257.95 million in 2011, such as James Cameron and Steven Spielberg. In May 2011, the average United States film director made $92,220.\n\n\ne Other Side of the Camera\", Visible Ink Press, 1999\n"}

Co-founded by Hank Willis Thomas and Eric Gottesman in 2016, For Freedoms has partnered with US-based institutions and artists for activations including Town Halls, exhibitions and installations, public programs, billboard campaigns, and artist residencies. In June 2018, For Freedoms launched the 50 State Initative, described as the 'largest-ever public art project in the US'.\n\nCo-founded in 2016 by Hank Willis Thomas, a photographer and conceptual artist, and Eric Gottesman, a video artist and activist, For Freedoms was inspired by Norman Rockwell's paintings of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “Four Freedoms” wartime address in 1941—a call to safeguard the freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. In January 2016 For Freedoms was registered as the first artist-run political action committee and began raising money for national advertising through the artistic collaboration \"Postcards from America\", a project of Magnum Foundation artists Jim Goldberg, Gilles Peress, and Alec Soth. The Postcards from America Photographs, as well as works from Carrie Mae Weems, Rashid Johnson, Xaviera Simmons, Bayeté Ross Smith, Fred Tomaselli, and Marilyn Minter, were exhibited at Jack Shainman Gallery in summer of 2016. In July of that year, outside of For Freedoms headquarters, a flag by Dread Scott was added to the show, drawing immense attention. Displayed outside the gallery in Manhattan on the week of the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, Scott sparked national conversation about police brutality by reinterpreting the early 1900s NAACP flag \"A Man Was Lynched Yesterday,\" updating it to read \"A Man Was Lynched By Police Yesterday.\"\n\nFor Freedoms released a national billboard campaign a month before Donald Trump's election in October 2016. The organization commissioned artists for billboards in Denver, Colorado; Flint, Michigan; Columbus, Ohio; Lexington, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Pearl, Mississippi; New Orleans, Louisiana; Tallahassee, Florida; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; as well as billboards in November in Miami, Florida and Cleveland, Ohio. The billboard in Pearl, MS—which superimposed Donald Trump's Campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again over Spider Martin's image \"Two Minute Warning\" of Bloody Sunday—incited local and national controversy. Then-governor Phil Bryant called the billboard imagery \"reprehensible\", and Pearl mayor Brad Rogers vied to have the billboard taken down, an action which raised questions over First Amendment rights.\n\nThe initiative held residency at MoMA PS1 for the first 100 days of the Trump Administration. \"Laboratory for Freedoms\" was an activation space for public meetings, town halls, and performances. That summer, For Freedoms held an artist's workshop for MoMA and curated Aperture Foundation's Summer Open exhibition \"On Freedom\". As well, the group continued doing town halls and billboards in collaboration with Museum of Contemporary Art, Cleveland and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. \n\nIn 2017, For Freedoms Federation, LLC was created to engage with educational partners in order to activate the cultural infrastructure of the country in the pursuit of social change. For Freedoms Federation acts as a hub for other artists, arts institutions, and activists who want to be more engaged with the current political system in all of the fifty states and Puerto Rico with the stated aim of making democracy more transparent and responsive. In 2018, all For Freedoms activation began operating under the Federation as opposed to the PAC.\n\nFor Freedoms has worked with more than 150 artists working in the United States. \nSome For Freedoms artists include:\n\nA For Freedoms activation is typically a billboard, exhibition, or an artist-led town hall, though activations have also taken the form of public programs, installations, bus stop benches, public meetings, subway advertisements, memes, and lawn signs. \n\n\n\n\nFor Freedoms was awarded the 2017 Infinity Award for Online Platform and New Media by International Center for Photography.\n\n"}

David Kubiak, Mander summarizes his book:\n\nWell, one of the points of the book is that you really can't summarize complex information. And that television is a medium of summary or reductionism – it reduces everything to slogans. And that's one criticism of it, that it requires everything to be packaged and reduced and announced in a slogan-type form.\n\nBut let me say this: the book is not really four arguments, it's really hundreds of arguments broken down into four categories. And the categories have to do with a variety of effects that are not normally discussed. Most criticisms of television have to do with the television program content. People say if there is less violence on television or less sexism on television, or less this or less that, television would be better. If there were more programs about this or more programs about that, then we'd have \"good television\".\n\nMy own feeling is that that is true – that it's very important to improve the program content – but that television has effects, very important effects, aside from the content, and they may be more important. They organize society in a certain way. They give power to a very small number of people to speak into the brains of everyone else in the system night after night after night with images that make people turn out in a certain kind of way. It affects the psychology of people who watch. It increases the passivity of people who watch. It changes family relationships. It changes understandings of nature. It flattens perception so that information, which you need a fair amount of complexity to understand it as you would get from reading, this information is flattened down to a very reduced form on television. And the medium has inherent qualities which cause it to be that way.\n\nAnd the book is really about television considered from a holistic point of view, from a biological point of view – perceptual, environmental, political, social, experiential, as well as the concrete problems of whether a program is silly or not. But other people deal with that very well. My job was to talk about television from many of these other dimensions which are not usually discussed.\n\n\n"}

It was built during the Ottoman rule in the 17th century and is located at the foot of the Casbah, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mosque that stands on the first of the Casbah’s many steep stairways, was logistically and symbolically the cynosure of the pre-colonial city of Algiers. The mosque is noted for its unique fusion of Moorish and Byzantine architecture.\n\nThe mosque was originally built in 1612. Later, in 1845, it was converted during French rule, to the Cathedral of St Philippe, which remained so until 1962. It was reconverted into a mosque in 1962. In spite of these transitions over two different religious faiths in roughly the last four centuries, the mosque has retained its original grandeur and is one of the major attractions of Algiers.\nKetchaoua Mosque is located in the historic Casbah in Algiers, which is located in the northern part of the city. It is located approximately 250 metres west of the Great Mosque of Algiers, located near the Archbishop's Palace of Algiers and the National Library of Algeria. The mosque, built during the rule of the Ottoman Empire, was once at the centre of the city. Its strategic location, standing on the first of the Casbah’s stairways which led to the five gates of the city in the aristocratic district where the rich and the famous royal family members of the Ottoman Regency, political prominence and other rich business magnates lived. It was built on the site of an Icosium; the original Phoenician settlement existed at the site of the mosque in the past.\n\nThe Casbah (means fortress), next to the Mediterranean Sea shore, is a unique kind of medina, or Islamic city which preceded the construction of the Ketchaoua Mosque at its centre. It overlooking the islands where a Carthaginian trading-post was established in the 6th century BC but the city of Algiers was only founded in the 10th century by the Zirids; over the next several centuries successive rule under the Berbers, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs and Spaniards left their impact here. \n\nThe history of the Ketchaoua Mosque is integral to the ancient history of the Casbah, which is recognized under UNESCO World Heritage List for its cultural heritage. The mosque was built under the Ottoman Rule (16th and 17th centuries) at the centre of the Casbah. Its exact location was at the centre of the city at the intersection of the roads from the lower Casbah leading to the five gates of the Algiers city. An unconfirmed mention is made of the mosque in the 14th century, but the confirmed \"notarial document\" dates it to 1612. However, it was rebuilt by Hasan Pasha according to a commemorative inscription in the later part of the 18th century when it was glorified as a structure of \"Unparalleled beauty.” In 1838, the mosque was converted into a cathedral named as \"the St. Philippe Cathedral\" by the French. In 1840, following the conquest of the Algerian city of Constantine by France, Marshal Sylvain Charles Valée got a cross fixed on top of the cathedral. After the liberation of Algeria from French rule, the cathedral's restitution as the Ketchaoua Mosque in 1962 is considered as \"having significant religious and cultural importance,\" and it richly testifies the history of \"this mosque-turned-cathedral-turned-mosque\". The rededication of the cathedral into a mosque was performed in the first year of Algerian independence itself, in a formal ceremony presided by Tawfiq al Madani, the Minister of Harbours, held at the Ben Badis Square (earlier known as Lavigere). This event has also been described as \"correlatively for the reconquest of Algeria’s authenticity as a supreme symbol of the nation’s recovery of its integrity.\"\n\nApart from the Ketchaoua Mosque, there are remains of the citadel, other old mosques and Ottoman-style palaces, as well as the remains of a traditional urban structure.\n\nThe principal entrance to the mosque is through a flight of 23 steps. At the entrance, there is an ornamented portico, which is supported by four black-veined marble columns. Inside the mosque, there are arcades built with white marble columns. The beauty of the mosque's chambers, minarets and ceilings of the mosque are accentuated by the distinct Moorish plaster work. The mosque, which now overlooks the public square in the Casbah, with the sea in front, has two octagonal minarets flanking the entrance, with Byzantine and Moorish design and decorations, presents a graceful sight. Many of the white marble columns belong to the original mosque. There is a tomb with the remains of San Geronimo enshrined in one of the chambers in the mosque.\n\nIn 2009, the Heritage Department of Algeria planned on carrying out improvements to the octagonal minarets, the central vault of the main fascia and the abutting staircase inside the mosque. These were planned to be completed over a 12 months schedule. While the minaret of Ketchaoua Mosque, which was partially on the brink of partial collapse is now under restoration, plans were developed for implementation, in three stages, including the restoration of the Casbah itself, in more general terms. This plan, launched in September 2008, covers the renovation of several mosques in old Algiers and the conversion of a number of houses into libraries at an initial cost of 300 million Algerian dinars.\n\n"}

{"id": "2880987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2880987", "title": "Libeaus Desconus", "text": "Libeaus Desconus\n\nLibeaus Desconus is a 14th-century Middle English version of the popular \"Fair Unknown\" story. Its author is thought to be Thomas Chestre. The story matter displays strong parallels to that of Renaut de Beaujeu's \"Le Bel Inconnu\"; both versions describe the adventures of Gingalain, the son of King Arthur's knight Gawain and a fay who raises him ignorant of his parentage and his name. As a young man, he visits Arthur's court to be knighted, and receives his nickname; in this case Sir Libeaus Desconus, before setting forth on a series of adventures which consolidate his new position in society. He eventually discovers who is his father, and marries a powerful lady.\n\nOther versions of the story include the Middle High German romance \"Wigalois\" (1204–1209) by Wirnt von Gravenberc. The \"Fair Unknown\" story has parallels in the tale of La Cote Male Taile, Chrétien de Troyes' \"Conte du Graal\", Sir Thomas Malory's \"Tale of Sir Gareth\" from \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", and the 14th century Italian epic \"Carduino\".\n\nVersions of \"Libeaus Desconus\" can be found in the following manuscripts:\n\nJudged by the number of surviving manuscripts, the \"Libeaus Desconus\" was the most popular of the Arthurian romances in Middle English.\n\nGyngelayne is raised in the forest by his mother, who tries to keep him away from arms since she fears that her 'wild' son might otherwise come to harm. Gyngelayne is never told his real name by his mother. Instead, she calls him ‘Bewfiȝ’, since he is 'gentle of body' and has an attractive face. One day, Gyngelayne finds a dead knight in the forest. He dons the man’s armour and goes to Glastonbury, where King Arthur is holding court. There he asks Arthur to dub him a knight although his upbringing is uncourtly. Arthur is so pleased by young Gyngelayne's sight that he gives him a name – Libeaus Desconus, ‘The Fair Unknown’ – and knights him that same day. Libeaus at once asks King Arthur if he might be offered the first challenge for which the king is required to provide a champion.\n\nSoon a fair maiden, Ellyne, and a dwarf, Theodeley, come riding in. They have been sent by the lady of Synadowne, who has been imprisoned. Cannot Arthur send a knight to free her mistress? When Arthur grants the youthful Libeaus the quest, the maiden is angered, yet the king refuses to replace Libeaus with another knight. \n\nLibeaus, Ellyne, and the dwarf set off on their journey, in acrimony. On the third day, Libeaus defeats a knight called Syr William Delaraunche, who had never yet been overcome in combat. Only now does Ellyne's ridicule of Lybeaus subside. Libeaus sends 'Syr William' to Arthur’s court, where he is to tell the king who defeated him. Next morning, Libeaus is attacked by William’s three cousins. He breaks one's thigh, another's arm and forces them all to go to Arthur’s court, where they are to tell the king by whom they were defeated, and subject themselves to him.\n\nIn a wild forest, Libeaus saves a maiden from two giants and sends their heads to King Arthur. The maiden's father, an earl, offers Libeaus his daughter’s hand in marriage, but Libeaus declines because he has a mission to accomplish. He is then given beautiful armour and a fine steed and he, the maiden Ellyne and the dwarf continue on their journey. Libeaus next defeats the Lord of Cardiff, winning a gyrfalcon, a scene that bears striking similarities with an episode in Chrétien de Troyes' twelfth century romance \"Erec and Enide\", retold in the Welsh Mabinogion tale \"Gereint and Enid\". He has the prize taken to Arthur, who is so satisfied with his knight that he decides to send him a hundred pounds. Libeaus uses the gold to hold a forty-days feast, and then moves on with his companions.\n\nIn a forest, Libeaus catches a many-coloured hunting dog at Ellyne's request. A man called Sir Otis claims that it is his, but Libeaus refuses to give it up. He soon finds himself faced by a full-fledged army, which he defeats single-handedly. Sir Otis, too, is sent to Arthur’s court. And after many adventures in Ireland and Wales, Libeaus arrives at the beautiful Isle of Gold ('Jl de Ore'), a city of castles and palaces. Its lady is besieged by a Saracen giant called Maugys. After a long and eventful fight, Libeaus is able to kill the giant. La Dame Amour, Lady of the Island, offers the hero her love, and lordship over the Jl de Ore. Libeaus gladly accepts, and for twelve months he lives a life of 'recreauntise'. When one day Libeaus meets the maiden Ellyne, she points out to Libeaus that he has been disloyal to his lord in abandoning his quest. He feels deeply ashamed and leaves the Jl de Ore. With him he takes his horse, his armour and Jurflete, La Dame Amour’s steward, whom he makes his squire. They travel onwards, he, Ellyne and his new squire, towards Synadowne.\n\nArriving at Synadowne at last, Libeaus defeats Lanwarde, the city’s steward, who has the habit of fighting every knight who comes to the city looking for a place to stay. Libeaus asks who the knight is who is holding the Lady of Synadowne prisoner. Lanwarde informs Libeaus that the Lady of Synadowne is being held captive not by any knight but by two clerics who practice black magic (‘nigermansye’):\n\nLanwarde informs Libeaus that these two clerics, called Jrayne and Mabon, have created a 'paleys', an edifice which no nobleman dares enter, and they say that they will kill the lady unless she transfers all of her power to Mabon.\n\nNext morning, Libeaus enters this palace and, leading his horse by the reins, finds nobody there but minstrels playing their music. Going deeper into the palace, searching for someone to fight with, he passes magnificent columns and stained glass windows and sits down on the raised platform at the far end of the space. The minstrels who had been playing now vanish, the earth shakes, and stones fall down. On the field outside appear the two clerics, Mabon and Jrayne, armed and on horseback. They are intent on killing Libeaus, who does battle with them both, but Jrayne disappears before Libeaus can deal him the final blow: he was too busy slaying Mabon, 'the more shreweos'.\n\nDepressed, Libeaus sits down in the palace hall: Jrayne might well cause him trouble in the future. While Libeaus contemplates his situation, a window appears in one of the walls, and a serpent with wings and a woman’s face crawls through. It speaks, asserting that it is 'young', and then kisses a terrified Libeaus. Consequently, it changes into a beautiful young woman: the Lady of Synadowne. She thanks Libeaus for freeing her, and tells him that he has slain both of the evil clerks. She also tells him that the only way the curse which had changed her into a serpent could be lifted was by kissing Gawain or someone else of his kin. Then the lady offers herself and her many possessions to Libeaus, who gladly accepts. \n\nAfter seven joyous days in Synadowne, Libeaus and the Lady of Synadowne go to King Arthur’s court, where Arthur grants Libeaus the lady’s hand. A forty-day feast follows, after which the newly-weds are escorted back to Synadowne by Arthur and his knights, where they live happily together for many years.\n\n\"Libeaus Desconus\" is a late-fourteenth century Middle English poem of around 2200 lines (the exact number of lines varies amongst the six manuscripts). Like many Middle English romances (e.g. The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle and Emaré) the poem is divided into stanzas of tail-rhyme verse, a rhyming couplet followed by a tail-rhyme, repeated four times in each stanza in a scheme like AABCCBDDBEEB.\n\nWriting principally in a dialect of southern England, possibly the SE Midlands, Thomas Chestre has been described as a 'hack writer' who had an acquaintance with a number of other Middle English romances and was able to borrow from them, often retaining the different dialects of the bits and pieces he incorporated into his own poetry. Libeaus Desconus was written for a more popular audience than the Old French romances on which it models itself.\n\nMost of the themes and motifs in \"Libeaus Desconus\" are drawn from a common stock of medieval Arthurian material. It is difficult to assign a unique work from which this Middle English poem derives, although some have argued for a lost twelfth century romance from which both \"Libeaus Desconus\" and the much earlier, late-twelfth or early-thirteenth century Old French \"Le Bel Inconnu\" have their source. \"Le Bel Inconnu\" may have been known to the author in a manuscript copy that was not identical to the only copy which now survives, and Thomas Chestre may have had access to this 'as well as other, related, material'.\nThere are Old French, Middle High German and Italian versions of this tale, however, ranging in date from the late-twelfth/early thirteenth century to the fifteenth century, and the similarities, links and differences between them seem too complex simply to assume a lost twelfth-century work from which they all originate. This, despite a line in Libeaus Desconus that refers to a French source, “in Frensshe as it is j-ffounde” when describing a scene that differs from \"Le Bel Inconnu\".\n\nAs well as the late-twelfth/early thirteenth century Old French romance \"Le Bel Inconnu\", or its hypothesised precursor, there are a number of other influences which may have contributed to Thomas Chestre's story \"Libeaus Desconus\".\n\nThe story of a young man who is brought up in the forest by his mother because she does not want him to learn about chivalry and fighting, and who later arrives at King Arthur's court in an innocent and dishevelled state with the desire to be made a knight, is none other than an account of the childhood of Perceval. Chrétien de Troyes introduced Perceval at the beginning of his unfinished last romance, Perceval, le Conte du Graal, written between 1180 and 1190 in which this young man, following his unlikely arrival at King Arthur's court, becomes embroiled in a search for a castle that, from the quills of other authors, evolved into a quest for the Holy Grail. There are indications that the author of \"Le Bel Inconnu\" knew not only Chretien de Troyes' \"Perceval, le Conte du Graal\" but also the Second Continuation of this story, written some few years after Chretien de Troyes' death. \"Libeaus Desconus\" describes a succession of events immediately preceding the appearance of Mabon and Jrayne outside the palace in which Libeaus waits with his horse (sudden darkness, slamming of doors and windows, shower of stones, earthquake) that correspond very closely to one found in another adventure in Arthurian romance: the description in the \"Vulgate Lancelot\" of Sir Bors visit to the Grail Castle.\n\nA Middle English verse romance \"Sir Perceval of Galles (Sir Perceval of Wales)\" relates early events in the life of Perceval that are similar to those in Chretien de Troyes' \"Perceval, le Conte du Graal\" but then goes off at a tangent and omits any reference to the graal castle. 'This omission has prompted the question of whether or not the tale's author knew Chrétien's version of the story.' \"Sir Perceval of Galles\" may draw upon an earlier and more primitive version of the tale than Chrétien's, which would explain why it omits any reference to the graal castle or the graal, since these were inventions of Chrétien de Troyes. It has been suggested that the young man Libeaus Desconus 'is only Perceval with a new name.'\n\nThe collection of medieval Welsh stories known as the \"Mabinogion\" includes a short romance \"Peredur\", considered to date from the late-twelfth or early-thirteenth century. This tale follows Chrétien's \"Perceval, le Conte du Graal\" for the most part (with deviations) and seems to know of the Graal continuation by Manessier \"Peredur\" may not simply be a working over of Chretien's \"Perceval\", however, but based upon an earlier version of the story, one from which both Chretien de Troyes and the author of a lost twelfth century romance – a romance upon which both \"Le Bel Inconnu\" and \"Libeaus Desconus\" may be based – each took as the basis for their respective works. The story of \"Peredur\" climaxes near the end of the tale with the slaying of a serpent. Many of the incidents in the story not following Chretien's \"Conte du Graal\" are likely to represent a 'Celtic tradition'. and 'confused or half-remembered stories about the hero.'\n\nPeredur may be the original name of Perceval, since Perceval in Old French is a meaningless 'pierce-valley'. Peredur seems similar to the \"Mabinogion\" character Pryderi in temperament and other evidence suggests as well that Pryderi may be the original of Peredur. Pryderi was born to the goddess Rhiannon, elsewhere in the \"Mabinogion\", but snatched away by a monster and a dead puppy disguised to be his body. He returned again when the monster was killed and was brought up as Gwri Golden Hair, brought to his father's court, returned to Rhiannon and renamed Pryderi. Thus, like the mythological Ulster hero Cú Chulainn, Pryderi had two names and associations with a dog. It has been considered 'well known that the stories of the youth of Cú Chulainn resemble those of the youth of Perceval.' Peredur goes to one of the nine Hags of Gloucester to learn how to wield arms, just as Cú Chulainn went to the witch Skatha to learn how to fight.\n\nWhen Libeaus Desconus sends all the knights whom he defeats back to King Arthur's court, he is following the behaviour of Perceval in Chretien's adventure that leads him to the castle of the Fisher King. And in Chrétien de Troyes' earlier romance \"Erec and Enide\", retold in the Mabinogion tale of \"Geirant and Enid\", following the episode where the hero fights a knight in a kind of beauty competition whose prize is a sparrow-hawk, Chretien's story, retold in the \"Mabinogion\", describes a knight and a lady, who are not on speaking terms with one another, travelling through the countryside and encountering a succession of hostile knights whom the hero jousts with and kills. This story has itself been considered a successful reworking of material from which the tales of the Fair Unknown derive, in particular creating a heroine 'who is more complex and interesting than any of her counterparts in \"Le Bel Inconnu\". There is evidence that Arthurian tales were often reworked, and that characters not originally associated with King Arthur in the eleventh and twelfth centuries were absorbed into his epic.\n\nThe twelfth century romance \"Ipomedon\", written in Norman French by Hue de Rotelande, is found in a Middle English version \"Ipomadon\" in MS Chetham 8009, lying in Chetham's Library, Manchester, England and dating from 'between the last decade of the fourteenth century and the middle of the fifteenth century'. Following a number of adventures in which the eponymous hero demonstrates his martial prowess, Ipomadon puts on the garb of a fool and goes to the court of the uncle of the lady he loves, the King of Sicily, where he agrees to stay only if he is granted the 'fyrste battayle'. Shortly after he arrives, a maiden appears, 'apon a palfreye white as mylke' seeking a champion to free her lady from oppression. The fool (Ipomadon) asks again that the quest be given to him. Since nobody else at court wants to undertake this task, the king concedes his request. The maiden is far from impressed. Only slowly does she moderate her acrimony as the fool travels along with her, defeating one hostile knight after another, until they reach the maiden's land and he frees the lady, who is, in fact, the lady he loves. The maiden's name is Imayne, she travels with a dwarf, and along the way, Ipomadon defeats a knight named Maugys.\n\nThe upbringing-in-the-wild motif is evident not only in tales of the Fair Unknown and in Chretien de Troyes' \"Perceval, le Conte du Graal\" but in the Breton lay Tyolet. Known from only one Old French manuscript, dating to the late-thirteenth or early-fourteenth century, the lay itself was probably composed by the beginning of the thirteenth century Like Perceval and Libeaus Desconus, Tyolet arrives at King Arthur's court as a young man who has spent all his childhood living alone in the forest with his mother. Like Perceval and Libeaus Desconus, what prompts Tyolet to go to King Arthur's court in the first place is the sight of armour. Unlike Chretien's \"Perceval\", but like \"Libeaus Desconus\", an animal in this story is transformed into a human, in this case a stag which changes into an armed knight, a 'knight-beast'.\n\nThe Breton lays that we have from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, on the evidence of the opening passages in \"Tyolet\" and others, describing their transmission, are possibly derived from stories that are considerably older, although the desire of medieval authors to 'seek to ensure a measure of authenticity for their tales' should be remembered. Similarities in \"Tyolet\" and the Second Continuation of Chretien's \"Perceval, le Conte du Graal\" has led R H Loomis to observe that the two stories 'must derive from a common remote source'.\nInstances of animals transforming into human beings occur also in the twelfth century Breton lays of Marie de France, in particular Bisclavret and Yonec.\n\nThe episode of the many-coloured hunting dogs and Libeaus's taking of one of them for Ellyne occurs also in \"Le Bel Inconnu\" and has parallels with a \"Lay of the Great Fool\", recorded by O'Daly in his Fenian poems, and well as a similar story in Campbell's \"Popular Tales of the West Highlands\".\nR S Loomis notes the similarities between the early life of Perceval and a twelfth-century text detailing the boyhood deeds of Fionn mac Cumhaill and makes a similar comparison with the boyhood of Sir Gawain's son Gingalais, who arrives at King Arthur's court to become the Fair Unknown. Fionn mac Cumhaill, for example, was a high-born son, first named Demne, deliberately reared deep in the forest, away from the threat of arms, spent his childhood hunting in this forest and at last came upon the home of a great lord where he was given the name Fionn, or Fair.\n\n\n"}

He died in Paris in 1906. This is a listing of his main works.\n\nThese are listed below.\n\nIn 1881, Lebourg executed an allegory of Nantes as part of the town hall's decoration.\n\nLebourg executed the bronze statue \"Travail\" for the École Diderot. It was shown at the 1885 Paris Salon and the Paris Exposition Universelle (1889).\n\nIn 1872 Lebourg completed a posthumous bust in white marble based on a photograph of the Wallaces by Étienne Corjat of 1855. His white marble bust of Lady Wallace shown here was exhibited at the Paris salon in May 1872.\n\nThis Lebourg sculpture depicting a shepherd reading stands in the grounds of the Château de Fontainebleau.\n\nLebourg has three of his sculptures decorating parts of the outside of the Louvre. The Mollien Pavilion and the Ailes Mollien (an \"aile\" is a wing) is part of the cour Napoléon and is named after a Treasury minister at the time of the French Empire (Nicolas François, Count Mollien) and Lebourg's \"La Chasse\" is one of the group of children decorating what is known as the \"aile en retour Mollien\". The second of Lebourg's sculptures can be seen in the Richelieu pavilion where the tympanum of the arcade of the passage leading to the rue de Rivoli is decorated with Lebourg's bas relief \"Vérite et Histoire\". The third sculpture, again part of the cour Napoléon, decorates the Apollon rotunda and is entitled \"La Force\". The Musée d'Orsay hold the plaster model of \"La Chasse\".\n\nLebourg is arguably best known for his caryatids for the famous cast-iron Wallace fountain, a public drinking fountain seen all over France and in many parts of the world. They are named after the Englishman Richard Wallace, who financed their construction. A great aesthetic success, they are recognized worldwide as one of the symbols of Paris. A Wallace Fountain can be seen outside the Wallace Collection in London, the gallery that houses the works of art collected by Sir Richard Wallace and the first four Marquesses of Hertford. The caryatids depict \"La Simplicité\", \"La Bonté\", \"La Sobriété\" and \"La Charite\" as shown below.\nAs external decoration of this building in Paris' 9th arrondissement, Lebourg created two caryatids.\n\nThis monument stands in Nantes's Place Duchesse-Anne. Four sculptors worked on the monument, Georges Bareau, Charles-Auguste Lebourg, Henri Émile Allouard and Louis-Auguste Baralis. Lebourg's contribution was the statue of the infantryman. The monument was erected in 1897 and the inauguration ceremony in April of that year was attended by Félix Faure, Jules Méline, Louis Barthou, Admiral Armand Besnard and Hippolyte-Étienne Étiennez the Nantes mayor. The bronze at the monument's summit, entitled \"Pour le drapeau\" was by Georges Bareau and had been cast in bronze by Barbedienne. It depicted a man slaying an eagle and at the monuments base were \"le Fantassin\" by Lebourg, \"le Marin\" by Louis Baralis, \"l’Artilleur\" by Émile Allouard and \"Le Fusilier colonial\" also by Allouard. In 1940 the occupying Germans dismantled the bronze believing that the slain eagle could be construed as representing the German eagle but the municipal workers of Nantes delegated to carry out the dismantlement managed to hide the sculpture, so stopping it being melted down. The work was retrieved in 1981, restored and re-erected in 1987.\nThere is a Lebourg decoration on the outside of this building.\n\nLebourg executed several medallions for tombs in this cemetery including that of Général Mellinet.\n\nThis bust is in Nantes' Jardin des plantes.\n\nLebourg executed the equestrian statue of Joan of Arc in Nantes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Joueur de biniou, dansant la nigouce\".

The dog is poorly behaved and destructive, and the book covers the issues this causes in the family as they learn to accept him in addition to their grief following Marley's death. It has subsequently been adapted by the author in three separate books, as well as separately into a comedy-drama film released in 2008.\n\nTold in first-person narrative, the book portrays Grogan and his family's life during the thirteen years that they lived with their dog Marley, and the relationships and lessons from this period. Marley, a yellow Labrador Retriever, is described as a high-strung, boisterous, and somewhat uncontrolled dog. He is strong, powerful, endlessly hungry, eager to be active, and often destructive of their property (but completely without malice). Marley routinely fails to \"get the idea\" of what humans expect of him; at one point, mental illness is suggested as a plausible explanation for his behavior. His acts and behaviors are forgiven, however, since it is clear that he has a heart of gold and is merely living within his nature.\n\nMarley was filmed for a two-minute credited appearance in the 1996 movie \"The Last Home Run\".\n\nThe strong contrast between the problems and tensions caused by his neuroses and behavior, and the undying devotion, love and trust shown towards the human family as they themselves have children and grow up to accept him for what he is, and their grief when he finally dies from gastric dilatation volvulus (a stomach torsion condition) in old age, form the backdrop for the biographical material of the story.\n\nIn the autobiography, the author states that the eulogy he wrote in his newspaper following the death of his dog received more responses than any other column he had written in his professional life up until that point.\n\n\"Marley & Me\" has been rewritten into three different books:\n\nIn 2008, the novel was adapted into a family comedy-drama motion picture, also titled \"Marley & Me\".

That 'in good times and bad, in sickness and in health' really means something. We didn't give up on Marley when it would have been easy to, and in the end he came through and proved himself a great and memorable pet.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "15762798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15762798", "title": "Modern Kannada literature", "text": "Modern Kannada literature\n\nModern Kannada literature refers to the body of literature written in the Kannada language, a language spoken mainly in the Indian state of Karnataka. The Kannada script is the writing system used in Kannada literature. In the last forty years, eight modern Kannada authors have been awarded the Jnanpith award, a prestigious private literary award in India. In addition, the Sahitya Akademi Award, the second-highest award for literature granted by the Government of India, has been conferred upon Kannada writers fifty times.\n\nThe nascent beginnings of modern Kannada literature can be traced to the early 19th century under the stewardship of Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, the ruler of the princely state of Mysore, and court poets who attempted to steer away from the ancient \"champu\" form of prose and popularize prose renderings of Sanskrit epics and plays. Kempu Narayana's \"Mudramanjusha\" (\"Seal Casket\", 1823) can be considered the first modern novel, anterior to English influence on Kannada. Though inspired by Vishakhadatta's Sanskrit original \"Mudrarakshasa\", the work displays a creativity of its own.\n\nThe impetus to modern literature came from a Western-style education and the Christian missionaries who relied on the local language to propagate the gospel. The arrival of the printing press was a catalyst to this process. Among the several early Kannada publications, the first Kannada-English dictionary by Ferdinand Kittel (1894) is noteworthy. B. L. Rice edited and published ancient Kannada classics and compiled a brief history of Kannada literature, while J. H. Fleet compiled a collection of folk ballads including the well-known \"Sangoli Rayana Dange\" (\"The Revolt of Sangolli Raya\"). The most outstanding lyrical poet of this period, whose poems were reminiscent of the medieval mystic Kannada poetry, was Sisunala Sharief.\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, progress towards original works in prose narratives initially gained momentum through translations from Sanskrit, English (\"Yatrikana Sanchara\" from \"The Pilgrims Progress\", 1847), Marathi (\"Yamuna Paryatana\") and Bengali languages (\"Durgesanandini\"). Early dramatic literatures were translations from Sanskrit (\"Shakuntala\", 1869) and English (\"Macbeth\", \"King Lear\" and \"Romeo and Juliet\").\n\nWith the standardization of modern prose, the earliest original social fictions were \"Suryakantha\" by Lakshman Gadagkar (1892) and \"Indira Bai\" by Gulvadi Venkata Rao (1899). With the theme being reform, the latter work critically examines social issues, reflecting an awakening. Original plays carrying the same theme include, among others, the \"Iggappa Heggadeya Vivaha Prahasana\" by Suri Venkataramana Sastri (1887). Nanadalike Lakshminarayana ('Muddanna') wrote two important prose pieces; \"Adbhuta Ramayana\" (1895) and \"Ramaswamedham\" (1898). What makes the latter writing historically important is that the epic Ramayana is looked at from a modern sensibility with the author as the narrator and his wife as the listener, the narration being interrupted at various stages with humorous exchanges between the couple, resulting from questions raised by the listener. The transition from the age of verse to prose may be summed up with Muddanna's proclamation \"poetry deserves killing whereas prose reaches the heart\" (\"Padyam Vadyam, Gadyam Hridyam\").\n\nWith the turn of the 20th century, B. M. Srikantaiah ('B. M. Sri'), regarded by some as the \"Father of modern Kannada literature\", gave the call for writing originals in modern Kannada, emancipating the language from ancient courtly classics and stressing the need for the influence of English literature. This period can be considered a seed time, for a golden age to come. His adaptation of lyrics from English were effective, the best known among his works being the \"English Geethagalu\" (\"English Songs\"), a seminal work that set the trend for \"Navodaya\" (new birth) Kannada poetry to come. Other notable poets who were able to evolve new metrics out of old ones were Masti Venkatesh Iyengar in his poem of love and tragedy, the \"Madalingana Kanive\" (\"Madalinga's Valley\", 1924) and Govinda Pai in the \"Kavitavatara\" (1916).\n\nThough Panje Manjesh Rao (1900) is considered a pioneer in the field of short stories, it is Masti Venkatesh Iyengar who is credited for laying the foundation for a generation of short-story tellers with his \"Kelavu Sanna Kathegalu\" (\"A few Short Stories\", 1920) and \"Sanna Kathegalu\" (\"Short Stories\", 1924).\n\nThe consolidation of modern drama was pioneered by T. P. Kailasam, a towering personality in the field, with his \"Tollu Gatti\" (\"The Hollow and the Solid\", 1918). In contrast to the earlier \"Indira Bai\" (1899), this work examines the modern education system from a Gandhian viewpoint. Kailasam followed this with \"Tali Kattoke Cooline\" (\"Wages for tying the Mangalsutra\"), a story that criticizes the dowry system in marriage. Kailasam's plays were mainly concerned with problems effecting middle class Brahmin families; the dowry system, religious persecution, woes in the extended family system and exploitation of women. He represented for the first time in Kannada theatre, a spokesperson for liberal values and is thus considered by some as the one who laid the foundation of amateur Kannada theatre.\n\nSummarizing the earlier historicals written in English by B. L. Rice, J. H. Fleet, Robert Sewell and Bhandarkar, Alur Ventaka Rao wrote the novel \"Karnataka Ghatavaibhava\" (1917). The work was intended to re-kindle pride among Kannadigas about their glorious past and bring awareness about the great rulers, poets and saints who had originated from Karnataka, its traditions and its heritage in arts and architecture.\n\nThe Navodaya period saw the rise of acclaimed lyricists who combined mystic poetry of the \"Vachanas\" and \"Kirthanas\" of medieval times and the native folk songs of oral traditions with influences from modern English romantics. Best known among them are D. R. Bendre, Gopalakrishna Adiga, K. V. Puttappa (Kuvempu), Shivarama Karanth, V. K. Gokak, Masti Venkatesh Iyengar, D. V. Gundappa ('DVG'), P. T. Narasimhachar, M. V. Seetharamiah, G. P. Rajaratnam, K. S. Narasimhaswamy and Adya Rangacharya ('Sri Ranga') and Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar.\n\nBendre is perhaps the most outstanding of modern Kannada lyricists, authoring a collection of 27 poems, including such masterpieces as \"Gari\" (\"Wing\", 1932), \"Nadaleela\" (1938) and \"Sakhigeetha\" (1940). His poems had a transcendental quality about them which were neither narrative or dramatic. They cover a wide range of themes including patriotism, love of nature, conjugal love, transcendental experiences and sympathy for the poor. The \"Sakhigeetha\" is an autobiographical poem about his married life and personal experiences. Bendre had sworn that, in his poetry, he would \"rather sow stars in Kannada soil than brillian jewels\".\n\nThe beauty and grandeur of the Malnad hills strongly influenced Kuvempu, one of Kannada's doyen poets, in his \"Kalki\" (1933) in which the poet describes the life of the agrarian community. He further showed his brilliance in using the blank verse in his masterpiece and \"magnum opus\" that took him nine years to write, the \"Sri Ramayana Darshanam\" (1949) which contains 22,284 lines, divided into 50 cantos. This work marks the beginning of modern Kannada epic poetry. While the poem follows the Valmiki tradition, Kuvempu puts a stamp of originality on it, bringing together the Indian and western epic traditions.\n\nIn a departure from the original epic, Lanka (Ceylon) does not burn in the war nor does Sita enter the fire alone (called \"Agni Pravesha\"), but rather is followed by Rama. Both however reappear from the fire unscathed giving the mortals a glimpse of their divinity. Not only is Sita's chastity proven, so is Rama's fidelity towards her. Like medieval poet Nagachandra, Kuvempu portrays Ravana as an \"evolving soul\". He pays homage to all the great poets of the world, including the sage Valmiki, thus placing himself in the tradition of world epic poetry. The work abounds in metaphors and similes and brings home the thought that all living beings will eventually evolve into perfect beings. In the words of a historian, \"No one could have imagined that the Kannada language is capable of this complex musical quality, for the first time in this century was Kannada made a language worthy of the gods\".\nGovinda Pai succeeded in depicting an authentic Christian ambience in the \"Golgotha\" (1931). Considered a unique Christian work in Indian literature, Pai narrates in detail, starting from the Christ being taken to Pontius Pilate by a hostile group of Jews demanding his death and the events leading to his crucifixion at Golgotha. The success of this work encouraged Pai to follow with three panegyrics in 1947; \"Vaishakhi\", \"Prabhasa\" and \"Dehali\", narrating the last days of the Buddha, God Krishna and Gandhi respectively. \"Gilivindu\" is his first collection of poems. Forty-six in all, they bring out his love for nature, his country and Kannada language while the \"Nandadeepa\", a collection of 37 poems are about devotion to god.\n\nThe influence of the west inspired a new genre in writing, the \"essay\". Here, A. N. Murthy Rao's \"Hagaluganasugalu\" (\"Day Dreams\", 1937) is best known.\n\nM. V. Seetharamiah came to limelight during the peak of the Navodaya period and was inspired by such well-known writers as B. M. Srikantaiah and Masti Venkatesh Iyengar. A man of many talents, he was a renowned poet (\"Hakki Hadu\" or \"Bird Song\"), novelist (\"Robinson Crusoe\"), short story writer (\"Maargadharshaka\"), painter, musician, literary critic, researcher, dramatist (\"Swayamvara\" or \"Choice of a Husband\"), essayist (\"Hidi Hoovu\" or \"Handful of flowers\") and biographer (\"Kavi Ranna\" or \"Poet Ranna\"). To his credit are twelve collections of poems, ten collections of short stories, nine novels, four collections of essays, and nine plays.\n\nAll of Seetharamiah's contributions carry a liberal message of love for his surroundings, nature and mankind. An authority on Kannada grammar and literary history, it is to his credit for researching and establishing that the true author of the 9th century Kannada classic \"Kavirajamarga\" may have been poet Sri Vijaya in the court of King Amoghavarsha I. He established a research foundation in the name of his mentor, B. M. Srikantaiah (\"B. M. Srikantaiah Prathishtana\").\n\nPerhaps the closest in comparison to the wisdom poems of the late medieval poet Sarvajna is the \"Mankuthimmana Kagga\" (\"Dull Thimma's Rigmarole\", 1943) by D. V. Gundappa. A successful journalist, he was known for his command over the Kannada language and its classics, with a knowledge of Sanskrit as well, despite his limited education which was limited to matriculation only. These qualities and experiences were to serve him well as a writer. Attributed to him are 60 writings in just about every genre of modern Kannada with the exception of the novel. His adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" into Kannada is well acclaimed.\n\nThe celebrated writer of conjugal love poems, who is known to have been inspired by Robert Burns, K. S. Narasimhaswamy won critical acclaim for \"Mysore Mallige\" (\"Mysore Jasmine\", 1942), a description of the bliss of everyday marital life. In later years, his poems were more metaphysical and included contemporary events in \"Dominion Janana\" and the \"Samsara Rajyanga\".\nEminent poets produced inspiring poetic dramas, B. M. Srikantiah being the trailblazer with his \"Gadayuddha Natakam\" (\"The War of Clubs\", 1925), a modern version of Ranna's 982 classic and \"Aswaththaman\", a native version of the Greek play \"Ajax\" by Sophocles. This was the beginning of tragic drama in Kannada, and a new way portraying ancient local heroes.\n\nGovinda Pai's \"Hebberalu\" (\"Thumb\", 1946) dramatizes the story of Drona and Ekalavya, characters from the epic Mahabharata. Kailasam and his worthy contemporary, A. N. Swamy Venkatadri Iyer ('Samsa') continued to produce fine dramas. Samsa is credited with writing twenty-three plays, of which only six have survived. Of these, a trilogy on the Mysore King Ranadhira Kanteerava are well known; \"Vigada Vikramarya\" (\"The Wicked Vikramarya\", 1928), \"Vijayanarasimha\" (1936) and \"Mantrashakti\" in (1938).\n\nSri Ranga was a dominating and complete authority as a playwright, though he has penned poems and novels as well. In a period of forty years, he authored more than 40 full-length plays and more than 100 one-act plays. His plays, filled with wit and satire, are divided over two periods, the first between 1930 and 1952 where they mostly concerned with social issues. He wrote on Gandhian values and the decadence caused by the caste system in his \"Harijanwara\" (\"The Harijan week\", 1934), the \"Sandhyakala\" (1939) and the \"Sokachakra\" (1952).\n\nThe wit and satire in Kailasam's language, Kannada laced with English, and the social reformer in him are best exemplified in his plays \"Bahishkara\" (1929) which focusses on religious practices, and \"Soole\" (\"Prostitute\", 1945), which dwells on social problems.\n\nThe 1930s saw the rise of another major figure in Kannada literature, Shivarama Karanth, who debuted in play \"Garbhagudi\" (\"Sanctum\", 1932), which decries the exploitation of society in the name of religion. A series of successful novels were written by him in this period, best known among which are \"Chomana Dudi\" (\"Choma's Toil\", 1933) which describes the plight of a harijan in Indian society and \"Marali Mannige\" (\"Back to the Soil\", 1942), a story about rural life on the west coast centred on a family's evolution over three generations, during a time of change brought about by westernization. Kuvempu's well accepted \"Kanur Subbamma Heggadithi\" (\"Subbamma Heggadithi of Kanur\", 1936) is about an educated protagonist in a conservative society.\nV. K. Gokak, who was educated in Oxford, established himself as an important contributor to poetics, criticism, drama and the novel in Kannada, with no less than 55 books to his credit. In addition, he was a distinguished critic of Indo-English literature. His other interests included culture, religion, philosophy and education. His first novel, \"Ijjodu\" (\"Misalliance\", 1935) dwells on marital problems caused by sexual incompatibility. His short stay in England helped confirm his love for his native country and language, resulting in the generation of \"Samudragitegalu\" (\"Sea songs\", 1940) and \"Samudradacheyinda\" (\"From Beyond the Seas\", 1940), the latter being a travelogue on his experiences there. His real epic, \"Bharata Sindhu Rashmi\" runs into 35,000 lines with the introduction in English.\n\nMasti Venkatesh Iyengar continued to dominate in short stories with such classics as \"Kakana Kote\" (\"Kaka's Fort\", 1938), a novel that remained obscure for some time. Set in a tribal atmosphere, the story brings out the life of a tiny hamlet which eventually merges with a feudal chiefdom. Masti's description of their life, love and society is authentic and natural.\n\nWhether P. T. Narasimhachar wrote an essay, a play or a poem, the poet in him was always evident. He has three collection of essays to his credit; \"Rathasaprami\" (1935), \"Ecchalumarada Kelage\" (1949) and \"Dhenukapurana\" (1969).\n\nOther notable writers of this period were Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar and Ajjampur Sitaram ('Ananda'). Gorur gave up studies to join the freedom struggle at the age of 17 and came under the enduring influence of Mahatma Gandhi whom he knew personally. He was active in the promotion of the \"Cottage Industry\" at the village level in the erstwhile Mysore state. A marvelous story teller, his first book \"Halliya Chitrgalu\" (\"Village Vignettes\", 1930) won him many laurels for his keen observation and narration of the beauty of rustic life. He followed this with several stories, describing on one hand the casteism and superstitions of rural communities and on the other the simplicity and charm in these communities. In addition to stories, he has to his credit essays, skits, travelogues and novels. In fact among the first novels ever to be written on the independence struggle was penned by him and is titled \"Merevanige\" (\"Procession\", 1948). Ananda's outstanding book, \"Nanu Konda Hudugi\" (\"The Girl I Killed\") is a tragedy centred on a girl who commits suicide after social disgrace.\n\nGopalakrishna Adiga describes the joy of political independence in \"Kattuvevu Navu\" (\"We Shall Built\", 1948), a longing for spiritual values in \"Mohana Murali\" (1944) and the importance of individual freedom in \"Samaja Bhairava\".\n\nThis period saw the emergence of new trends such as the Navya (modernist) and Pragatishila (progressive) though the legends of the previous era continued to produce notable works in the older Navodaya style. In poetry, D. R. Bendre's \"Naku Tanti\" (\"Four Strings\", 1964) and Kuvempu's \"Aniketana\" (1964) are well known. Gokak brought out the innate insufficiencies in the more advanced western cultures in \"Indilla Nale\" (1965).\nThe Navodaya style novels continued to be successful with such noteworthy works as Shivarama Karanth's \"Mookajjiya Kanasugalu\" (\"Mookajji's Visions\", 1968), where the author explores the origins of mans' faith in the mother goddess and the stages of evolution of civilization. Kuvempu's \"Malegallali Madumagalu\" (\"The Bride of the Hills\", 1967) is about loving relationships that exist in every strata of society. Being a playwright, Sri Ranga gave a dramatic touch to his \"Purushartha\" (1947) where the entire action is on 15 August 1947, and the protagonist and his three friends reminisce about the past.\n\nMasti Ventakesh Iyengar's two classic novels of this era were the \"Channabasavanayaka\" (1950), which describes the overthrow of Bidanur's chief Channabasava Nayaka (on Karnataka's coast) by Haider Ali in the late 18th century, and \"Chickavirarajendra\" (1950), which describes the fall of the tiny kingdom of Coorg ruled by King Chikka Virarajendra into the hands of the British East India Company. Masti describes the social, economic, political and cultural situation at that time and the methods used by the British to gain territorial control. The common theme in both works is the despotism and tyranny of the incumbent native rulers resulting in the intervention of a foreign power, which appears on the scene to restore order, but has its own imperialistic intentions.\n\nMasti's other important stories are \"Navaratri\" (\"Nine Nights\") and his epic \"Sri Rama Pattabhishekha\" (\"Rama's Coronation\", 1972). The latter story begins with the end of the Ramayana war and the return of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana to Ayodhya. Rama, who is crowned as King of Ayodhya is elevated to the level of a \"perfect man\", who has overcome extreme difficulties, his personage being described through the viewpoint of several people who have been in close association with him.\n\nA charismatic young writer, S. L. Bhyrappa made his presence felt from the 1960s with his first novel \"Dharmasri\", though it was his \"Vamsavriksha\" (\"Family Tree\", 1966) that put him in the spotlight as one of Kannada's most popular novelists. It is a story of a respected scholar, Srinivasa Srotri, his family and their long held values. The protagonist's young and widowed daughter-in-law wishes to remarry, putting his family tradition at risk. His best was yet to come with the \"Grihabhanga\" (\"Breaking of a Home\", 1970), a story of a woman who tries in vain to survive under tragic circumstances. The characters in the story are rustic and often use vulgar language. Other important novels are \"Datu\" (\"Crossing\", 1973) which portrays a harijan who revolts against the caste system, and \"Parva\", a major work in Kannada fiction and an admirable attempt at recreating life on the sub-continent during the time of the epic Mahabharata.\n\nImportant women writers of the time were Tirumalamba, the first woman novelist; Anasuya Shankar (popularly known as \"Triveni\"), who authored the famous novel \"Sharapanjara\" or \"Cage of Arrows\"; and M. K. Indira, who offered insight into women's problems.\n\nFor a short while, a simplistic form of fiction literature called Pragatishila (progressive), meant for the common man, gained popularity. The earliest writing in this style is ascribed to A. N. Krishna Rao ('An Ka Ru') who portrayed an idealistic musician in \"Sandhyaraga\" (1935). The best-known writers in this class are Basavaraj Kattimani who celebrated the heroes of the Quit India Movement in \"Madi Madidavaru\" (\"Those Who Did and Died\"), the tenacity of a journalist in \"Jwalamuhkiyamele\" (\"On the Volcano\", 1951), and the rural atmosphere in \"Mannu mattu hennu\" (\"Soil and Women\"). His \"Mohada Baleyalli\" (\"Caught in Passion\") describes immorality in religious institutions.\n\nT. R. Subba Rao dropped out of school to join the freedom struggle but later came under the influence of well known journalist S. K. Sharma and the passionate Kannada writer A. N. Krishna Rao. After a short stint as a journalist, Subba Rao took to writing short stories though his talent and consequent popularity was due to his novels. Subba Rao's numerous stories are intense and full of idealism but always with a human face. His early novels, \"Purushavatara\" and \"Munjavininda Munjavu\" concerned the problems of the underprivileged, the downtrodden and the outcaste.\n\nA native of Chitradurga, many of Subba Rao's stories have this region as the backdrop, drawing on its rich history and the heroics of its Palegar chiefs. His later novels show an inclination towards philosophy, in contrast to his earlier atheist beliefs. Best known among his novels are \"Masanada Hoovu\" (\"Flower from a Cemetery\") a story about the plight of prostitutes, and historicals such as \"Durgasthamana\" and \"Hamsa Gite\" (\"Swan Song\"), a story about a dedicated musician of the late 18th century during annexation of Chitradurga by Tipu sultan.\n\nIt was Gokak who gave the call that the Navya (modernist) poetic era had arrived, with his \"Navya kavitegalu\" (\"Modern Poems\", 1950). With the passing of the Gandhi era and the influences it had upon the minds of people, a new era in which to express modern sensibilities had arrived. Gopalakrishna Adiga is considered the father of this expression with his \"Nadedu Banda Dari\" (\"The Path Traversed\", 1952) where he sought inspiration from T. S. Eliot and Auden. His other famous poems are \"Gondalapura\" (\"Pandemonium\", 1954), \"Bhoota\" (1959) and others.\nThough he belonged to the earlier Navodaya generation in the Gokak mould, G. S. Shivarudrappa made his mark in the Navya period too. His \"Mumbai Jataka\" (\"A Horoscope of Bombay\", 1966) takes a closer look at urbanized society in Mumbai. A protege of Kuvempu, Shivarudrappa gained fame at the peak of the popularity of romantic poems with his \"Samagma\" (\"Songs of Equanimity\", 1951), poems which are known to have an idealistic bend. He continued to produce more poems in the same vein, such as \"Cheluvu Olavu\" (\"Beauty and Truth\", 1953) and \"Devashilpa\" (\"Divine Sculpture\", 1959), though in his later poems a gradual shift to social issues with a streak of admiration for god's creation is seen. As a critic, Shivarudrappa has authored several books, some about Kannada poets and others a comparison of eastern and western cultures, such as \"Vimarsheya Purva Paschima\" (1961), a critique on attitudes; \"Soundarya Samikshe\" (1969), on aesthetic values; and \"Mahakavya Swarupa\" (1971), on the practice of the epic form. His critical essay, \"Anuranana\" (1980), is about the Vachana poets of the 12th century, their tradition, style and influence on later poets.\n\nK. S. Narasimhaswamy continued to be prominent in this era writing such landmark poems as \"Silalate\" (\"The Sculptured Creeper\", 1958), \"Tereda Bagilu\" (\"The Open Door\", 1972), \"Malligeya Male\" (\"Jasmine Garland\", 1986), \"Idadiru Nanna Ninna Simhasanada Mele\" (\"Place me not on your Throne\") and \"Gadiyaradangadiya Munde\" (\"Before the Clock Shop\"). Among the most well-known of later generation Navya poets are Chandrashekhara Kambar, Chandrashekar Patil, P. Lankesh, and K. S. Nissar Ahmed.\nIn the late 1950s, Sri Ranga produced several well-known dramas focussing more on the creator of society (man), in a dramatic style, than on social problems in his \"Kattale Belaku\" (\"Darkness and Light\", 1959) and \"Kelu Janamejaya\" (\"Listen Janamejaya\", 1960). In his effort to take his original plays to audiences outside Karnataka, he was helped by theatrical troupes such as the Karnataka Theatre of Bombay, Kannada Amateurs of Dharwad and even well known director-producers such B. V. Karanth.\n\nOther outstanding playwrights from this period are Girish Karnad, P. Lankesh, Chandrashekara Kambar and Chandrashekar Patil. Karnad's \"Tughlaq\" (1964) portrays violence created by idealism gone astray. Considered an important creation in Kannada theatre, the play depicts the 14th century Sultan of Delhi, Mohammad Tughlaq in contrasting styles. On one hand the Sultan is a tyrannical and whimsical ruler, and on the other, an idealist who seeks the best for his subjects. Most plays written by Karnad have either history or mythology as their theme, with a focus on their relevance to modern society.\n\nKambara's \"Jokumaraswamy\" (1973) is perhaps the most popular amateur play in the language. It presents the conflict between a ruthless power and the popular revolt, leading to the death of the protagonist, the soil tiller. Kambara is best known for his insight and his ability to bring the folk element into his plays. Lankesh's \"Sankranthi\" (1973) brings out the tumultuous events of the late 12th century, during the rise of the Lingayat faith and the struggle of Brahminism in this period. The presentation includes disputations between the saint-poet Basavanna and his patron King Bijalla II.\nThe Navya novel was launched by Shantinath Desai with his \"Mukti\" (1961) which narrates the protagonist's quest for an independent identity, liberation from his dependence on a friend and his infatuation for the friend's sister. His second novel, \"Vikshepa\" (1971), tells the story of a village youth from northern Karnataka who attempts to flee from his traditional environment by studying English in Bombay and later flee to England. An English translation was published recently. Veena Shanteshwar brings feminine sensibilities to her novels, notable among them being \"Mullugalu\" (\"Throns\", 1968) and \"Koneya Dari\" (\"The Final Choice\", 1972)\n\nHowever, the most acclaimed classic in this genre was the \"Samskara\" by U.R.Anantha Murthy (1965). The novel narrates the search for a new identity and values by the protagonist, a Brahmin, who has sexual intercourse with the untouchable mistress of his heretical adversary. Another notable work is the \"Swarupa\" (1966) by Poornachandra Tejaswi.\n\nIn the genre of short stories, writers who are best known are U. R. Anantha Murthy, Yashwant Chittal, P. Lankesh, Ramachandra Sharma, Shantinath Desai, Rajalakshmi Rao and K.Sadashiva. Anantha Murthy's \"Prasne\" (1963) contains his best collection of short stories including \"Ghatashraddha\", which describes from a boy's point of view the tragedy that befalls a young pregnant widow. His collection \"Mouni\" (1973) includes the stories \"Navilugulu\" (\"Peacocks\") and \"Clip Joint\". In addition, using his strong background in English literature, Anantha Murthy has made useful contributions as a poet, a playwright and most influentially, as a critic in shaping the direction of modern Kannada criticism.\n\nFrom the early 1970s, a change is seen in the output of novels and stories, an anti-Navya reaction by writers, many of whom were themselves Navya writers. This genre, called \"Navyottara\" (post modernist), sought to fulfill a more socially responsible role. Most well known in this form of writing are Poornachandra Tejaswi and Devanur Mahadeva. Tejaswi moved away from his initial foray in poetry to writing novels, a move that won him accolades in the form of the \"most creative novel of the year\" for his \"Karvalo\" in 1980 and \"Chidambara Rahasya\" in 1985. His best-known short stories are \"Abachurina Post office\" (\"The Post Office at Abachur\", 1970) narrating the repercussions of setting up a post office at Abachur, \"Kubi mattu Iyala\" which is about a doctor who combats the superstitions of villagers and the \"Tabarana Kathe\" (\"Tabara's Story\") which decries bureaucracy. Most of his literature is related to nature, conservation and the farmers. Mahadeva's \"Marikondavaru\" (\"Those who sold themselves\") and \"Mudala Seemeli Kole Gile Ityadi\" (\"Murder in the Eastern Region\") effectively portray a realistic account of the life of dalits.\n\n"}
{"id": "8144722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8144722", "title": "Museum Planning Area", "text": "Museum Planning Area\n\nThe Museum Planning Area is a planning area located in the Central Area of the Central Region of Singapore. The area plays a \"bridging role\" between the Orchard area and the Downtown Core, which necessitates proper transport networks for vehicles, pedestrians and public transport. Due to the sheer size of green areas in the district, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has designated it a 'green lung' in the Central Area. However, the Museum Planning Area is also home to cultural and commercial activities. Around 65% of the area is available for future development, making it a hotbed for new infrastructure and buildings.\n\nMuseum planning area is bounded by the planning areas of Newton and Rochor to the north, the Downtown Core to the southeast, Singapore River to the south, River Valley to the west and Orchard to the northwest.\n\nTen national monuments are located within the Museum Planning Area, namely the Armenian Church, the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd, Cathay Building (now The Cathay), the Central Fire Station, the House of Tan Yeok Nee, the MacDonald House, the Old Tao Nan School (Peranakan Museum), the National Museum of Singapore, the Old Hill Street Police Station and the Singapore Art Museum/Former Saint Joseph's Institution. The area is home to significant events such as the Battle of Singapore and MacDonald House bombing. Other historical sites include:\n\n\nThe Museum Planning Area is bordered by Rochor to the northeast, the Downtown Core to the southeast, the Singapore River Area to the southwest, River Valley to the west and Newton and Orchard to the northwest. The area is roughly bounded by Hill Street, River Valley Road, Clemenceau Avenue and Bras Basah Road. It is the smallest urban planning area, with an area of 83 hectares. \n\nParks and open spaces take up a third of the area of the Museum Planning Area, and include Fort Canning, Istana Park and Bras Basah Park, which can be used for recreational purposes. Collectively, these places will form the so-called 'green lung' of the Central Area. Terraces have been proposed to allow for \"a more prominent and convenient access\" to the Fort Canning area.\n\nThe Museum Planning Area is Singapore's \"institutional hub\", with 11% of land set aside for institutional use and reserve sites to be safeguarded for future institutions. The many museums in the area, which give the Museum District its name, include the National Museum of Singapore, the Singapore Art Museum, the Asian Civilisations Museum, the National Archives of Singapore and the Singapore Philatelic Museum.\n\nThe arts scene is vibrant in the area, with The Substation, the Singapore Calligraphy Centre, the YMS Arts Centre and the Singapore Dance Ensemble all located within its boundaries. Scattered throughout the area are places of worship such as churches, mosques, Hindu temples and synagogues. The Registry of Marriages and the sprawling Singapore Management University campus are also located in the area.\n\nDespite its prime location, residential projects were only allocated 1% of the land area, and the Museum Planning Area was criticised for lacking residential zoning. Due to the lack of residents, there were fears that the area would become a \"ghost town\" at night. Furthermore, the concept of living within the Central Area had gained popularity, and up-market skyscraper condominiums could be built. The greenery of the Museum Planning Area could provide a peaceful environment for living. \n\nThe URA replied that several plots of land had been sold for residential-commercial mixed use, and that more housing developments were to be planned and constructed. The URA emphasised the importance of the area as a transition between the central business district and shopping areas, as well as the green, pedestrian-friendly nature of the URA's plan for the area.\n\nThe Museum Planning Area is home to various shopping malls, including Park Mall, Plaza Singapura, The Cathay, Singapore Shopping Centre and The Atrium @ Orchard. More vacant land will be set aside for commercial uses, especially around Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station and Bras Basah MRT Station. These will be properly integrated and connected with the respective stations.\n\nHotels in the area include Bayview Hotel Singapore and Hotel Rendezvous. Furthermore, a hotel development at the foot of Fort Canning Hill near the junction of Clemenceau Avenue and River Valley Road is in the planning stages, and is meant to be a retreat from urban living \"amidst lush greenery\". Other developments are planned on reserved sites near Fort Canning, but details have not been released.\n\nThe Museum Planning Area is served by four Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Stations: Dhoby Ghaut, Bras Basah, Fort Canning and Bencoolen The North South Line and the North East Line can only be accessible from Dhoby Ghaut while the Circle Line can be accessible from both and the Downtown Line can be accessible from Fort Canning and Bencoolen. The Central Expressway's Chin Swee Tunnel also passes under the area. \n\nSeveral changes to the road network in the area will be implemented, including the construction of Fort Canning Tunnel and the realignment of Stamford Road and Handy Road. The rationale for the improvements is increased traffic from Marina Centre and relieving the traffic congestion along Orchard Road. Furthermore, a new road network has been put in place to ensure smooth traffic flow after the full development of land around the MRT Stations.\n\n\nThe Development Guide Plan for the Museum Planning Area envisages \"a comprehensive pedestrian network linking developments, parks and open spaces\". New promenades and pedestrian malls are planned for the area to enhance and connect existing sidewalks. A web of underpasses and covered walkways will link Orchard, the Singapore River, Raffles City and Marina Centre.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6119054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6119054", "title": "Ninjas in popular culture", "text": "Ninjas in popular culture\n\nNinjas are historically known as Japanese spies, assassins, or thieves who formed their own caste outside the usual feudal divisions of lords, and samurai surfs. They are often used as stock characters in Japanese and world popular culture. \n\nThe ninja first entered popular culture in the Edo period, when folktales and plays about ninjas were conceived. In modern Japan, ninjas are a national myth that stems from folk tales and modern day popular culture. Some of these folk tales are based on historical figures, such as a \"daimyō\" (lord) challenging a ninja to prove his worth by stealing his pillow or weapon while he slept.\n\nNinja-themed international media franchises include the 1980s \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" comic book and animated series, and the late-1990s \"Naruto\" manga and anime series. \n\nSuperhuman or supernatural powers were sometimes associated with the ninja. Such powers include flight, invisibility, shapeshifting, the ability to \"split\" into multiple bodies, the summoning of animals, and control over the five classical elements. These notions stemmed from popular imagination regarding the ninja's mysterious status, as well as romantic ideas found in later Japanese art during the Edo period. Magical powers were sometimes rooted in the ninja's own efforts to disseminate fanciful information. For example, Nakagawa Shoshujin, the 17th-century founder of Nakagawa-ryū, or martial art style, claimed in his own writings (\"Okufuji Monogatari\") that he had the ability to transform into birds and animals.\n\nPerceived control over the elements may be grounded in real tactics, which were categorized by association with forces of nature. For example, the practice of starting fires in order to cover a ninja's trail falls under \"katon-no-jutsu\" (\"fire techniques\").\n\nThe ninja's adaption of kites in espionage and warfare is another subject of legends. Accounts exist of ninjas being lifted into the air by kites, where they flew over hostile terrain and descended into or dropped bombs on enemy territory. Kites were indeed used in Japanese warfare, but mostly for the purpose of sending messages and relaying signals. Turnbull suggests that kites lifting a man into midair might have been technically feasible, but states that the use of kites to form a human \"hang glider\" falls squarely in the realm of fantasy.\n\n\"Kuji-kiri\" is an esoteric practice which, when performed with an array of hand \"seals\" (\"kuji-in\"), was meant to allow the ninja to enact superhuman feats.\n\nThe \"kuji\" (\"nine characters\") is a concept originating from Taoism, where it was a string of nine words used in charms and incantations. In China, this tradition mixed with Buddhist beliefs, assigning each of the nine words to a Buddhist deity. The \"kuji\" may have arrived in Japan via Buddhism,8-11}} where it flourished within Shugendō. Here too, each word in the \"kuji\" was associated with Buddhist deities, animals from Taoist mythology, and later, Shinto kami. The \"mudrā\", a series of hand symbols representing different Buddhas, was applied to the \"kuji\" by Buddhists, possibly through the esoteric \"Mikkyō\" teachings. The \"yamabushi\" ascetics of Shugendō adopted this practice, using the hand gestures in spiritual, healing, and exorcism rituals. Later, the use of \"kuji\" passed onto certain \"bujutsu\" (martial arts) and \"ninjutsu\" schools, where it was said to have many purposes. The application of \"kuji\" to produce a desired effect was called \"cutting\" (\"kiri\") the \"kuji\". Intended effects range from physical and mental concentration, to more incredible claims about rendering an opponent immobile, or even the casting of magical spells. These legends were captured in popular culture, which interpreted the \"kuji-kiri\" as a precursor to magical acts.\n\nThe following manga and anime series feature ninjas:\n\n\nSanpei Shirato has written ninja-themed manga, including \"Akame – The Red Eyes\", (later adapted into an anime film), \"Kaze no Ishimaru\", \"Ninpou Hiwa\", \"Ookami Kozou\", \"Ninja Senpuu\", \"The Legend of Kamui\" and \"Watari\" (later adapted into the live-action film \"Watari, the Ninja Boy\").\n\nThe following stories contain a ninja character, but are not ninja-themed:\n\nSupporting ninja appearances include \"Ah! Itoshi no Banchousama\" (Hirayama Hayaka's ninja bodyguard), \"Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo\" (OVER's Ninja Assassin Corp and the Ultimate Five Assassins), \"Code Geass\" (Sayoko Shinozaki), \"Cutey Honey\", \"Dinosaur King\" (episode \"Ninja Nightmare\"), \"\" (Dream), \"Hero Tales\", \"Hunter x Hunter\" (Hanzo and Machi), \"Hyper Police\" (Kasumi), \"Kamen no Maid Guy\" (ninja maids Shizuku and Tsurara), \"King Arthur\", \"Kinnikuman\" (the Ninja), \"\" (Kirby becomes a ninja and works with Benikage and Yamikage in the episode \"\"), \"Kotetsu no Daibouken\" (Kagari), \"Lone Wolf and Cub\", \"\", \"Magical Nyan Nyan Taruto\" (Rakugan), \"Magical Princess Minky Momo\" (\"Ninja Arrived! Momo is Ninja\"), \"Mega Man Star Force\" (the Tribe-On transformation Green Ninja), \"Metal Fighter Miku\" (\"Pretty Four vs The Lady Ninjas\"), \"Miami Guns\", \"My-HiME/My-Otome\" (Akira Okuzaki), \"Nagasarete Airantou\" (Mikoto), \"Oh My Goddess!\" (Marller's ninja trio), \"Planetes\" (Tanabe's neighbors in \"The Lunar Flying Squirrels\"), the \"Pokémon\" series and \"\" (Aya, Koga-Kyō and Janine-Anzu), \"PQ Angels\", \"Raimuiro Ryuukitan X\" (Kasuri Hattori), \"Ranma 1/2\" (Konatsu, Sasuke Sarugakure, and Shirokuro), \"Saber Marionette\", \"Sailor Moon\" (the villain of the week Oniwabandana), \"Sakura Wars\", \"Samurai Champloo\" (\"Bogus Booty\" and \"Baseball Blues\"), \"\", \"Sengoku Collection\" (Kotaro Fuuma), \"Sonic X\" (the E-91 Lady Ninja and Espio the Chameleon), \"Sorcerer Hunters\", \"The King of Braves GaoGaiGar (Yūsha Ō GaoGaiGā)\" (Volfogg), \"Those Who Hunt Elves\", \"Tower of Etruria\" (Palmyra), \"Ultraman\" (Alien Baltan), \"Yami to Bōshi to Hon no Tabibito\", \"Yakitate! Japan\" (\"Nin Nin Nin!! My Way of Ninja!\"), \"Yoshimune\" (Kunoichi) and \"YuYu Hakusho\" (Team Shadow Channelers).\n\nSeveral paramilitary, police and militia groups use the names \"Ninja\" or \"Ninjas\":\n\nIn addition to video games, several game-development companies use \"ninja\" in their name: Ninja Studio, Ninja Theory, Ninjaforce, NinjaKiwi, and Team Ninja. In massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), \"ninja\", \"loot ninja\" or \"ninja looter\" pejoratively describes a player who has stolen something from another player.\n\nNinja-themed role-playing games (RPGs) include:\n\nNinja ara also featured in collectible card games such as \"Legend of the Five Rings CCG\", \"\" (where the ability Ninjutsu was introduced in the set Betrayers of Kamigawa) and \"Mortal Kombat Kard Game\", and in some miniature wargaming games, such as \"Heroscape\".\n\nNinja-themed websites include:\n\nIn information technology, \"cyber ninja\" are sophisticated counter-hackers.\n\nNinja-themed novels include:\n\nNinja have minor roles in \"Shōgun\", \"Thief of Time\", \"Vineland\" and the \"Young Samurai\" series.\n\nIn the Marvel Universe, ninjas have been heroes and villains. Examples include Spider-Man's foe White Ninja, X-Men members Psylocke, Revanche and supporting character Yukio, Ghost Rider's foes Deathwatch and Death Ninja, Wolverine's mentor Ogun, Hawkeye (as Ninja Ronin), the Punisher's friend Katherine Yakamoto (from Shadowmasters), and Pacific Overlords operative Kuroko (Aya Komatsu). In the \"Marvel Mangaverse\", Spider-Man is the last member of a ninja clan. A sinister ninja cult, the Hand, appears in \"X-Men\" and \"Daredevil\". The cult and its associates were responsible for the martial training of Psylocke, Elektra, Daredevil, Black Tarantula, Kitty Pryde, Lady Bullseye and Wolverine. The Hand's heroic counterpart is The Chaste, which struggles with its Korean offshoot the True Believers (including Dragonfly Meiko Yin).\n\nCharacters with mystical, superhuman martial-arts abilities attributed to ninja appear in the DC Universe. Bruce Wayne received ninja training prior to becoming Batman. Another character portrayed similarly to a ninja is master martial artist and assassin Lady Shiva; Shiva killed Armless Master, who trained Catwoman and Hellhound. One alternative-universe comic substitutes Batman with a Japanese female ninja named Komori (Bat). An alternative version of Robin, Tengu, was raised by Cat-Ninja (Catwoman) in feudal Japan. DC's The New 52 introduced Kunoichi, a member of the Blackhawks.\nIn the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" (TMNT) series, the main characters and many of their friends and foes are ninja, mainly from the Foot Clan (a pastiche of Marvel's group, the Hand): Donatello, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, Splinter, Shredder and Karai.\nThe comic version of \"G.I. Joe\" has featured more ninja than the cartoon series. Story arcs involved Scarlett, Snake Eyes, Storm Shadow, Jinx, Kamakura, Firefly and the Arashikage ninja clan, an extended family of ninja characters. Cobra Commander's son, Billy Kessler, and the shape-shifter Zartan also received ninja training from the Arashikage clan and their associates.\n\nOther ninja-themed comics include:\n\nShort-lived titles include \"Codename: Ninja\" and \"Zombee\". The \"Amelia Rules!\" series included \"A Very Ninja Christmas\".\n\nNinja have supporting roles in \"Karate Kommandos\", \"Lucha Libre\" \"Les Naufragés d'Ythaq\", \"Masters of the Universe\" (Ninjor), \"Rebirth\" (the hero's ally, Eiji Inaba), \"Sam Noir\" (villains), \"Scott Pilgrim\" (Roxanne \"Roxie\" Richter), \"\", \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" (Uma Arachnis and the Arachne), \"The Order of the Stick\" (Therkla and others), \"The Tick\" (Oedipus), and \"Usagi Yojimbo\" (ninja of the Neko, Mogura and Komori clans, including Kashira Chizu).\n\nSeveral musicians and bands have the word \"ninja\" in their names:\n\nA number of titles include \"ninja\" or \"kunoichi\":\n\nSongs with \"ninja\" in their titles include \"Deadly Lethal Ninja Assassin\" by Reuben (on \"We Should Have Gone To University\"), \"Hoodie Ninja\" by mc chris (on \"mc chris is dead\"), \"Imaginary Ninjas\" by Vince Dicola (on \"Falling off a Clef\"), \"Inner Ninja\" by Classified (on \"Classified\"), \"Ninja Goon\" by Gruvis Malt (on \"Sound Soldiers\"), \"Ninja Hi-skool\" by Bis (on \"\"), \"We Are Ninja\" by Frank Chickens (on \"We Are Frank Chickens\"), \"Ninja Highschooool\" by Peelander-Z (on \"P-Pop-High School\"), \"Ninja Rap\" by Vanilla Ice (on the ), \"Ninja Step\" by RZA (on the \"\" soundtrack), \"Ninja Quiet\" by Marco Beltrami (on \"\"), \"Supa Ninjaz\" by Method Man (on \"The Pillage\"), and \"This Secret Ninja\" by AFI (on \"Very Proud of Ya\").

{"id": "19596319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19596319", "title": "Norma Bates (Psycho)", "text": "Norma Bates (Psycho)\n\nNorma Bates () is a fictional character created by American author Robert Bloch in his 1959 thriller novel \"Psycho\". She is the deceased mother and victim of serial killer Norman Bates, who had developed a murderous split personality based on her.\n\nAlthough an important character to the \"Psycho\" story, Norma only appears as a corpse in the films. She is not depicted as a living character until \"\" (1990), portrayed by Olivia Hussey. Vera Farmiga later portrayed Norma in the television series \"Bates Motel\" (2013–2017).\n\nNorma Bates is the fictional counterpart to Augusta Gein, the mother of Wisconsin graverobber/murderer Ed Gein.\n\nThe 1959 novel, its 1960 film adaptation and the explain that after the death of her husband, Norma (whose maiden name is never revealed in the novels) raises her son Norman with cruelty: she forbids him to have a life away from her, and teaches him that sexual intercourse is sinful and that all women (except herself) are whores. The novel also suggests that their relationship may have been incestuous.\n\nFor many years, Norma and Norman live together in the (fictional) small town of Fairvale, California \"as if there is no one else in the world\". When Norman is a teenager, his mother meets Joe Considine (Chet Rudolph in \"Psycho IV: The Beginning\") and plans to marry. Considine convinces Norma to open a motel. Norman grows insanely jealous, believing that Norma has abandoned him for her fiancé, and murders them with strychnine. He then stages it like murder-suicide, making it look as if Norma had killed Considine and then herself.\n\nUnable to bear the loss of his mother, Norman steals Norma's corpse and mummifies it in the fruit cellar, and speaks to it as if his mother were still alive. He also speaks to himself in her voice and frequently dresses in her clothes; in his own mind, he \"becomes\" his mother in order to escape the awareness of her death and the guilt of having murdered her. The \"Mother\" personality is as possessive and cruel as Norma had been in life; \"Mother\" dominates and belittles him, forbids him to have friends, and kills any woman whom he feels attracted to. When Norman regains consciousness, he discovers the crime he is convinced his mother has committed, and destroys the evidence.\n\nOne of \"Mother\"'s victims is Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who flees to the Bates Motel after stealing money from her employer. When she checks into the motel, Norman is smitten, and invites her to have dinner with him in his office. This arouses \"Mother\"'s ire, and she threatens to kill Marion if Norman lets her into the house. He defies her and has dinner with Marion, who takes pity on him and gently suggests that he put his mother in a mental institution. He angrily rejects the suggestion, however, and insists that his mother is perfectly sane. After Marion retires to her room, Norman becomes \"Mother\" and kills Marion in the shower. When Norman regains consciousness, he disposes of Marion's corpse in a nearby swamp, covering up what he believes to be his mother's crime.\n\nMarion's employer hires private investigator Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to find her, and he goes to the motel and questions Norman. Norman mentions that Marion had spoken with his mother, but he refuses to let Arbogast see her. Suspicious, Arbogast goes to the house, where \"Mother\" kills him as well. Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles), and boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), soon arrive, suspecting Norman of killing Marion for the money. Lila discovers Mrs. Bates' corpse while searching the house; moments later, Norman attacks her as \"Mother\", only to be subdued by Sam. Norman is then arrested and institutionalized, and the \"Mother\" persona takes complete, permanent control of his mind.\n\nIn the film \"Psycho II\" (unrelated to Bloch's novel of the same name), twenty-two years later, Norman Bates, now supposedly cured, is released from the institution and returns home. He soon receives notes and phone calls supposedly from Mrs. Bates. Norman takes a job at a local diner and befriends Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar), the cook, and a waitress named Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly). Norman offers Mary a room in his house, and she reluctantly accepts. At about this time, a series of mysterious murders are committed by a woman with a knife to people who come to the motel and the house.\n\nNorman's sanity begins to unravel, as he starts to believe that his mother is committing the murders. His psychiatrist, Dr. Bill Raymond (Robert Loggia), shows him Mrs. Bates' corpse and reveals to him that Mary Samuels is actually Mary Loomis, Sam Loomis' daughter, and is plotting with her mother, Lila, to drive him crazy again in order to get him recommitted for Marion's murder; they both dress up as Norman's mother and appear through the window of her bedroom. Mary believes that the murderer is hiding in Norman's house, and when Norman explains to Mary that the murderer might be his \"real\" mother, she speculates that he might have been adopted.\n\nThe murderer eventually kills Lila. When Mary and Norman return to the house, Norman receives a phone call from Dr. Raymond; in his mind, however, the phone call is from his mother. Mary, disturbed, tries to convince Norman to stop answering the phone by dressing up as his mother, complete with a butcher knife. Mary accidentally kills Dr. Raymond, who has come to the house to catch Mary, and Norman tries to hide her from the police. Mary discovers Lila's corpse hidden in a pile of coal, and, convinced Norman is the murderer, tries to kill him. The police intervene just in time however, and shoot her dead.\n\nThat night, Mrs. Spool visits Norman and reveals that she is his real mother, and that Norma Bates was actually his aunt; Spool had been put in a mental institution shortly after giving birth to Norman, and her sister, Norma, had adopted him and told him that he was her son. Spool then reveals that \"she\" had committed the murders in order to protect Norman. He bludgeons her to death with a shovel, and carries her corpse up to Mrs. Bates' room, where the \"Mother\" personality takes control of his mind once again.\n\nA few months later, a reporter named Tracy Venable (Roberta Maxwell) latches on to the history of the Bates/Spool families; her research leads her to the story of a love triangle between Norman's father, John, and the Spool sisters, Norma and Emma. Emma killed John in a jealous rage after Norma stole him away from her, and abducted the young Norman, convincing herself he was the child she had with John. Emma was arrested and institutionalized, and Norman was returned to his mother.\n\nBy this point in the series, Norman has begun murdering young women again under the control of the Mother personality. He finds some hope for redemption when he meets and falls in love with a young woman named Maureen Coyle (Diana Scarwid), but \"Mother\" eventually wins out and kills her. Tracy finds Norman and tells him the truth about his parentage, and Norman destroys Mrs. Spool's corpse, attempting to break free of \"Mother\"'s control. He is arrested and sent back to the institution, but proclaims that he is finally free.\n\nThe fourth and final film in the series, retcons the revelations of the second and third film, supplying that Norman's father was stung to death by bees, removing all references to Emma Spool and retelling much of Norman's and his mother's past from the original film. It is implied in the film that Mrs. Bates suffered from schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder, which Norman inherits. Norman has been released from the institution and is now married. When Norman finds out that his wife, Connie (Donna Mitchell), is pregnant, he decides to kill her to prevent another of his \"cursed\" line from entering the world. He relents after his wife professes her love for him, however, and decides to rid himself of the past once and for all by burning down his mother's house. During this act, he sees visions of his mother mocking and tormenting him, but perseveres and destroys the house. At the end of the film, he is finally free of his mother's voice, which demands to be let out.\n\nThe television spin-off movie and series pilot changes the backstory between Norman Bates' parents (here named Jake and Gloria Bates) prior to the events of \"Psycho\". In this continuity, Mrs. Bates killed her husband because she thought he was cheating on her. She then lost her mind and spent all her time staring out her bedroom window, wearing black funeral clothes while waiting for him to return. Twenty-seven years after the events of the original film, Norman (Kurt Paul) dies of old age in the asylum, leaving his motel and house to his friend and fellow inmate, Alex West (Bud Cort). Alex comes to believe that the motel is haunted by Mrs. Bates' ghost. He eventually discovers that the \"haunting\" is a ruse perpetrated by bank manager Tom Fuller (Gregg Henry), who is trying to scare Alex into selling him the motel so he can renovate it.\n\nNorma Bates is a main character in the A&E psychological horror drama television series \"Bates Motel\", a contemporary prequel to the 1960 film \"Psycho\", set in the present day. Norma is portrayed in the series by Vera Farmiga. She is extremely possessive and protective of her son Norman and does everything she can to keep him to herself. This, along with several other traumas Norman suffered as a child, results in his developing an alternate personality, \"Mother\", who kills anyone whom she believes poses a threat to him or gets in the way of their relationship.\n\nOn the show, Norma's middle name is Louise. Her parents' names are revealed to be Ray and Francine \"Frannie\" Calhoun, and she describes her life with them as having been unhappy; her father was an abusive alcoholic while her mother was \"sedated all the time.\" She was born and raised in Akron, Ohio. As an adult, Norma owns and drives around in a light-green Mercedes-Benz W116 as her personal means of transportation throughout the series. The vehicle is later inherited by Norman who takes over ownership of the car in the final season after her death.\n\nIn the pilot episode, Norma buys a motel in the coastal town of White Pine Bay, Oregon, and moves there with Norman (Freddie Highmore) following the death of her husband Sam Bates (David Cubitt) in Arizona. The motel's former owner, Keith Summers (W. Earl Brown) breaks into the Bates' house and rapes Norma. Norman intervenes and subdues Summers, but Norma kills him in a fit of rage. She and Norman then dispose of the body. She later reveals that Sam was an abusive alcoholic and that Norman had killed him while in a dissociative state; she bought the motel and moved them away to protect him. A later episode reveals that Sam had raped Norma in front of Norman while in a drunken rage; it is implied that this trauma fractured Norman's psyche.\n\nIn this continuity, Norma has another son, Dylan Massett (Max Thieriot), who was conceived when she was raped as a teenager by her older brother, Caleb Calhoun (Kenny Johnson). Norma used Dylan's conception to escape from her troubled home life; she married her then-boyfriend, John Massett, and passed off her unborn child as his own. She would later divorce John to marry Sam, becoming estranged from Dylan and favoring Norman, her son with Sam, instead.\n\nWhen Norman's sanity begins to deteriorate, Norma marries the town sheriff, Alex Romero (Nestor Carbonell), so she can use his insurance coverage to pay for Norman to be treated in a mental institution. While the marriage is at first merely a financial arrangement, they eventually fall in love. After Norman is released from the institution and finds out that Norma is married, he grows insanely jealous and tries to kill himself and Norma by flooding the house with carbon monoxide while his mother sleeps. Romero arrives at the house in time to revive Norman, but finds that Norma is already dead. Romero finds out what happened and swears revenge, but is arrested for perjury before he can do anything. Meanwhile, Norman can not bear losing his mother, so he digs up her corpse and assumes her personality to preserve the illusion of her being alive.\n\nTwo years later, Norman is running the motel and living alone in the house with Norma's corpse, which he keeps frozen and preserved in the cellar. Romero, who is in prison for perjury, sends a hitman to kill Norman, but \"Mother\" takes control and kills the assassin. Caleb learns of Norma's death and comes after Norman, so \"Mother\" helps Norman take him hostage, but cannot bring herself to kill him. The Bates' neighbor Chick Hogan (Ryan Hurst) accidentally runs Caleb over, and \"Mother\" helps him and Norman dispose of the body. When Norman falls for Madeline Loomis (Isabelle McNally), a lonely housewife who bears an uncanny resemblance to Norma, and whose husband Sam (Austin Nichols) is cheating on her, \"Mother\" becomes jealous and acts out by taking over Norman's mind and making him have sex with a man at a gay bar while dressed in Norma's clothes. Norman finally begins to suspect that \"Mother\" is not real, and she confirms that he created her in his mind to deal with things that he could not, such as his abusive father.\n\nWhen Sam's mistress Marion Crane (Rihanna) checks into the motel, Norman fears that \"Mother\" will kill her, and tells her to leave and never come back. Sam soon arrives at the motel looking for Marion, and \"Mother\" convinces Norman to stab him to death in the shower.\n\nDylan comes to see Norman after learning of Norma's death, and they get into a fight that ends with Norman assaulting his half-brother at \"Mother\"'s instigation. Terrified of what he might do, Norman calls 9-11 and confesses to murdering Sam. After Sheriff Jane Greene (Brooke Smith) finds the bodies of Norman's other victims, \"Mother\" takes control of Norman's mind and tries to make sure that he escapes punishment.\n\nWhen Romero - who had earlier escaped from prison - takes Norman captive, \"Mother\" urges Norman to kill him, but not before he confronts Norman with the reality that he killed his mother. After Norman finally admits to himself that he killed Norma, \"Mother\" appears to him and tells him she is leaving, as there is no longer anything she can protect him from. Norman later invites Dylan to a \"family dinner\" with Norma's corpse at the head of the table. When Dylan tells Norman that Norma is dead, Norman attacks him, forcing Dylan to shoot him in self-defense. As he dies, Norman sees a vision of his mother embracing him.\n\nNorma Bates is the fictional counterpart to Augusta Gein, Ed Gein's mother; a domineering, fanatical woman who preached to her sons about the innate immorality of the world and her belief that all women (apart from herself) were inherently prostitutes and instruments of the devil.\n\nNorma is not strictly a character in the novel by Bloch, and her presence is indicated only as a voice and a corpse in the first three \"Psycho\" films.\n\nFor \"Psycho\" (1960), Alfred Hitchcock hired six uncredited people to play the mother. Norma Bates was played by Mitzi Koestner, Anna Dore, and Margo Epper as body doubles; and voiced by Virginia Gregg, Jeanette Nolan, and Paul Jasmin (a friend of Anthony Perkins). The voices were thoroughly mixed, except for the last speech, which is all Gregg's.\n\nNorma Bates was introduced as a living character in \"\". Olivia Hussey was directly offered the role.\n\nVirginia Gregg, Jeanette Nolan, and Paul Jasmin voiced the corpse of Norma Bates in Hitchcock's 1960 film adaptation of Bloch's novel. Only Gregg did Norma's voice in \"Psycho II\" and \"Psycho III\". Alice Hirson provided the voice of Norma's corpse in \"\". John Kassir voiced Norma's silhouette in a 1990 Oatmeal Crisp cereal commercial featuring Anthony Perkins reprising his role as Norman Bates. Rose Marie voiced Norma's corpse in Gus Van Sant's 1998 version of \"Psycho\". Olivia Hussey portrayed Norma as a living character in \"Psycho IV\". Vera Farmiga portrayed Norma as a living character in the TV series \"Bates Motel\". For her performance, Farmiga was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 2013, and won a Saturn Award in 2014 and a People's Choice Award in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Among the classicizing features are personifications that have been incorporated in the compositions. The discovery that images such as David composing the psalms surrounded by personifications were clearly derived from Greco-Roman wall painting led 19th-century scholars to date the manuscript to the early 6th century. In the early 20th century, however, Hugo Buchthal and Kurt Weitzmann, took issue with the Late Antique dating, conclusively demonstrating that the fully realized, confident classicism and illusionism of the miniatures were the product of the 10th century, thereby extending the persistence of classical art in Byzantium into the Middle Ages. The psalter was influential in its time and many centuries after that. It introduced a new way of illustrating psalters and manuscripts during the Byzantium period.\n\nThe David pictures emphasize the honor of the ideal emperor, often through the presence of personifications, both classical and Christian. It has been proposed that the book was made for the future emperor Romanos II at the behest of his father, Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos. The assumption that it is a copy remains ambiguous, but there is no confusion that the MS stands at the head of a long line of smaller and later books that mimic its body of illustration. The abiding hypothesis that its miniatures are later insertions has recently been challenged. The book as we now have it was available ca.1300 when some of its miniatures were adapted for Psalters now at the Vatican and Mt. Sinai. It was acquired by the French ambassador in Constantinople in 1557–59.\n\nAs a psalter, the Paris Psalter is a copy of the Book of Psalms, also known as the Hebrew's Bible, in Ancient Greek. Psalters were often owned by the rich and royalty and were used a tool to learn how to read. Many psalters were copied from the Middle Ages and usually richly illuminated.\n\nThe illuminations are large, each filling a full page. It was originally thought to be incomprehensible that a repertoire of pagan forms and subjects could have a place within a manuscript of Christian liturgical or private devotion. \n\nThe Psalter includes personifications which represent abstract concepts and virtues such as clemency. penance, and wisdom. The figures are shown as a true sign of revived interest in antiquity. The personifications dominate the liturgical and devotional aspect of the manuscript. \n\nKing David, the traditional author of many of the Psalms, is depicted in eight illuminations. He is presented in two primary ways: religiously (seen as Christ) and royal (model for a king). For example, David's victory over Goliath could be seen as a comparison to Christ's victory over Satan or the emperor's victory over an enemy.\n\n1.

Purism was led by Amédée Ozenfant and Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier). Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created a variation of the Cubist movement and called it Purism: where objects are represented as elementary forms devoid of detail. The main concepts were presented in their book \"Après le Cubisme\" (After Cubism) published in 1918.\n\nLe Corbusier and Ozenfant were the creators of Purism. Fernand Léger was a principle associate. Purism was an attempt to restore regularity in a war-torn France post World War I. Unlike what they saw as 'decorative' fragmentation of objects in Cubism, Purism proposed a style of painting where elements were represented as robust simplified forms with minimal detail, while embracing technology and the machine.\n\nPurism culminated in Le Corbusier’s \"Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau\" (Pavilion of the New Spirit), constructed for the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in 1925. This included the work of Cubists Juan Gris and Jacques Lipchitz. Following this exhibition the relationship between Le Corbusier and Ozenfant declined.\n\nOzenfant and Le Corbusier contributed extensively to an art magazine called \"L'Esprit Nouveau\" from 1920 to 1925 serving as a platform for propaganda towards their Purist movement.\n\nThe Purist Manifesto lays out the rules Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created to govern the Purist movement.\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1981 as the Rockport Chamber Music Festival, Rockport Music has been under the artistic direction of violinist/violist Barry Shiffman since 2017. From 1995-2017, the Festival was under the artistic direction of pianist David Deveau. In Summer 2010 the organization completed construction on a year-round permanent home, the Shalin Liu Performance Center. Situated on the Atlantic coast, one hour north of Boston, Rockport has long been a destination for seaside tourism and historically a fishing village and artist colony.\n\nRockport Music was founded in 1981 as the Rockport Chamber Music Festival—a twelve concert series of chamber, early, and vocal music—by singer Leila Deis and composer-pianist David Alpher, who acted as co-artistic directors until 1994, in collaboration with Rockport businessman Paul Sylva.\n\nRockport Music has since presented numerous artists, many of whom have returned repeatedly to perform in the festival, including Andrés Diaz (cello), Garrick Ohlsson (piano), Richard Stoltzman (clarinet), Andrés Cárdenes (violin), David Leisner (guitar), Edwin Barker (bass) and Jordi Savall (viola da gamba), as well as acclaimed groups such as the Eroica Trio (piano, cello & violin), the Emerson Qyartet, Borromeo, the Calder String Quartet, A Far Cry and the Canadian Brass.\n\nThe organization has also commissioned and premiered a number of compositions, including Lera Auerbach’s String Quartet No. 3 & Sonata No. 1 for cello and piano, Elena Ruehr’s \"Song of Silkie\", Mark Harvey’s \"Rockport Blues\", John Harbison’s \"Abu Ghraib\", Bruce Adolphe’s \"Whispers of Mortality\", and Scott Wheeler's \"Granite Coast\".\n\nSince the first festival in 1981, Rockport Music’s concerts were hosted by the Rockport Art Association in its Hibbard and Maddocks Galleries. In 2008, under the guidance of Artistic Director David Deveau and the Board of Trustees, preparation began on the site of Rockport Music’s new Shalin Liu Performance Center, which opened for the summer chamber music festival in June 2010. The new facility provides seating for approximately 330 and features a third-floor reception space complete with a catering kitchen. The facility is in compliance with the American with Disabilities Act. The concert stage, set in front of a two-story window overlooking Rockport’s Sandy Bay, is visible from ground level and balcony seating.\n\nThe space’s design is a collaboration between architects Alan Joslin and Deborah Epstein, of Epstein Joslin Architects (Cambridge, MA) and R. Lawrence Kirkegaard, of Kirkegaard Associates (Chicago). Joslin and Kirkegaard have also collaborated on, among other projects, Tanglewood’s Ozawa Hall. Construction was executed by Consigli Construction, which has worked on numerous historical buildings in New England\n\nAlso in 2008, the organization was renamed Rockport Music to reflect the gradual expansion of its mission and activities: the Rockport Chamber Music Festival has grown from twelve to twenty-four concerts. Since the opening of the Shalin Liu Performance Center in 2010, Rockport Music has presented a great variety of artists year-round, including Midori, pianist Russell Sherman, Scottish-style fiddler Hanneke Cassel, jazz legend Dave Brubeck, folk-rocker Roger McGuinn, jazz-singer Kurt Elling, and Rockport’s own Paula Cole. The Performance Center is also equipped with high quality audio-visual systems and hosts HD broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera and National Theatre, as well as special cinematic events, such as showings of the silent films Nosferatu and Metropolis with live musical accompaniment.\n\nRockport Music is continually developing its program of education activities for both children and adults. The organization has sponsored “mini-residencies” by accomplished musicians, wherein the artists work with students in Cape Ann’s public schools, culminating in free evening performances for the community. Since 2010, these artists have included Ten Tumbao, Jose Franch Ballester, Manguito, and the Harlem String Quartet, among others.\n\nDuring the Rockport Chamber Music Festival, Rockport Music hosts a lecture series, master classes, open rehearsals, and panel discussions, as well as free performances, for residents and visitors of Rockport. Educational outreach events for youth and adults featuring over 50 events annually, serve more than 10,000 individuals.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "88567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=88567", "title": "Savoy Theatre", "text": "Savoy Theatre\n\nThe Savoy Theatre is a West End theatre in the Strand in the City of Westminster, London, England. The theatre opened on 10 October 1881 and was built by Richard D'Oyly Carte on the site of the old Savoy Palace as a showcase for the popular series of comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, which became known as the Savoy operas as a result.\n\nThe theatre was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity. For many years, the Savoy Theatre was the home of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which continued to be run by the Carte family for over a century. Richard's son Rupert D'Oyly Carte rebuilt and modernised the theatre in 1929, and it was rebuilt again in 1993 following a fire. It is a Grade II* listed building.\n\nIn addition to \"The Mikado\" and other famous Gilbert and Sullivan premières, the theatre has hosted such premières as the first public performance in England of Oscar Wilde's \"Salome\" (1931) and Noël Coward's \"Blithe Spirit\" (1941). In recent years it has presented opera, Shakespeare and other non-musical plays, and musicals.\n\nThe House of Savoy was the ruling family of Savoy descended from Humbert I, Count of Sabaudia (or \"Maurienne\"), who became count in 1032. The name Sabaudia evolved into \"Savoy\" (or \"Savoie\"). Count Peter (or \"Piers\" or \"Piero\") of Savoy (d. 1268) was the maternal uncle of Eleanor of Provence, queen-consort of Henry III of England, and came with her to London.\nKing Henry made Peter Earl of Richmond and, in 1246, gave him the land between The Strand and the Thames where Peter built the Savoy Palace in 1263. On Peter's death, the Savoy was given to Edmund, 1st Earl of Lancaster, by his mother, Queen Eleanor. Edmund's great-granddaughter, Blanche, inherited the site. Her husband, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, built a magnificent palace that was burned down by Wat Tyler's followers in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. King Richard II was still a child, and his uncle John of Gaunt was the power behind the throne and so a main target of the rebels.\n\nIn about 1505 Henry VII planned a great hospital for \"pouer, nedie people\", leaving money and instructions for it in his will. The hospital was built in the palace ruins and was licensed in 1512. Drawings show that it was a magnificent building, with a dormitory, dining hall and three chapels. Henry VII's hospital lasted for two centuries but suffered from poor management. The sixteenth-century historian John Stow noted that the hospital was being misused by \"loiterers, vagabonds and strumpets\". In 1702 the hospital was dissolved, and the hospital buildings were used for other purposes. Part of the old palace was used for a military prison in the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century, the old hospital buildings were demolished and new buildings erected.\n\nIn 1864 a fire burned everything except the stone walls and the Savoy Chapel, and the property sat empty until Richard D'Oyly Carte bought it in 1880 to build the Savoy Theatre specifically for the production of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that he was producing. The new theatre was built speedily, and accounts noted that it \"was situated on a site which, though rich in historical associations, was also rich in the olfactory sense, Mr Rimmel's scent factory being close by as was Burgess's Noted Fish-Sauce Shop.\"\n\nCarte bought the freehold of the site, then known as \"Beaufort Buildings\", early in 1880 for £11,000, but had begun planning his theatre several years before. In 1877 he engaged Walter Emden, an architect whose work includes the Garrick and the Duke of York's theatres. Before completing the site purchase, city officials had assured Carte that they would open a new street on the south side of the plot, provided he paid half the cost. He paid his half in March 1880, but the officials caused lengthy delays. Carte told \"The Times\", \"I am struggling in the meshes of red tape\". He finally received the necessary agreement in June. At the same time he ran into another obstacle: Emden suddenly revised his estimate of building costs upward from £12,000 to £18,000. Carte dismissed Emden, who successfully sued for £1,790 for services to date and £3,000 for wrongful dismissal.\n\nDesign of the theatre was given to C. J. Phipps. The builders were Patman and Fotheringham. Plans were drawn up and executed with speed and efficiency. Nonetheless, the advertised opening date had to be put back several times while the innovative electrical work was completed. The Savoy finally opened on 10 October 1881. Carte had at one time intended to call it the Beaufort Theatre, but he announced in a letter to \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 1881, \"On the Savoy Manor there was formerly a theatre. I have used the ancient name as an appropriate title for the present one.\" The exterior of the building was made from red brick and Portland stone. The interior decoration, by Collinson and Locke, was \"in the manner of the Italian Renaissance\", with white, pale yellow and gold predominating, including a gold satin curtain (instead of the usual printed act-drop), red boxes and dark blue seats. There were none of the cherubs, deities and mythical creatures familiar from the décor of rival theatres. Carte wanted nothing that would appear too garish or gaudy to his target, middle-class audience.\nOn the opening night Phipps took curtain calls along with Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte. \"The Times\" commented, \"A perfect view of the stage can be had from every seat in the house.\" Exits on all four sides of the theatre were provided, and fireproof materials were used to ensure maximum safety. There were three tiers with four levels: stalls and pit, balcony, circle, and amphitheatre and gallery at the top. The total seating capacity was 1,292. The proscenium arch was high by wide, and the stage was deep from the proscenium to the back wall. The theatre originally had its main entrance on the Embankment. The parcel on which it was built is steep, stretching from the Strand down to the Embankment along Beaufort Street. After Carte built the Savoy Hotel in 1889, the theatre entrance was moved to its present location at the hotel's courtyard off the Strand.\n\nThe Savoy was a state-of-the-art theatre and the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity. In 1881, Sir Joseph Swan, inventor of the incandescent light bulb, supplied about 1,200 Swan incandescent lamps, and the lights were powered by a generator on open land near the theatre. Carte explained why he had introduced electric light: \"The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres. As everyone knows, each gas-burner consumes as much oxygen as many people, and causes great heat beside. The incandescent lamps consume no oxygen, and cause no perceptible heat.\" The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire front-of-house was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881. At that performance, Carte stepped onstage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology. \"The Times\" described the electric lighting as superior, visually, to gaslight. Gaslights were installed as a backup, but they rarely had to be used. \"The Times\" concluded that the theatre \"is admirably adapted for its purpose, its acoustic qualities are excellent, and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with.\" Carte and his manager, George Edwardes (later famous as manager of the Gaiety Theatre), introduced several innovations including numbered seating, free programme booklets, good quality whisky in the bars, the \"queue\" system for the pit and gallery (an American idea) and a policy of no tipping for cloakroom or other services. Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales.\nThe work that opened the new theatre was Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera \"Patience\", which had been running since April 1881 at the smaller Opera Comique. The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas were premièred at the Savoy: \"Iolanthe\" (1882), \"Princess Ida\" (1884), \"The Mikado\" (1885), \"Ruddigore\" (1887), \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" (1888) \"The Gondoliers\" (1889), \"Utopia, Limited\" (1893), and \"The Grand Duke\" (1896), and the term Savoy opera has come to be associated with all their joint works. After the end of the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership, Carte, and later his widow, Helen (and her manager from 1901–1903, William Greet), staged other comic operas at the theatre by Arthur Sullivan and others, notably Ivan Caryll, Sydney Grundy, Basil Hood and Edward German. The Savoy Operas of the 1890s, however, were far less successful than those of the Gilbert and Sullivan heyday. After Carte's production of \"The Chieftain\" ended in March 1895, the Theatre briefly hosted the Carl Rosa Opera Company and then closed until late 1895, when Carte resumed productions at the theatre. Sullivan died in 1900, and Richard D'Oyly Carte died in 1901.\n\nThe Savoy Theatre closed in 1903, and was reopened under the management of John Leigh and Edward Laurillard from February 1904 (beginning with a musical, \"The Love Birds\") to December 1906. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company returned to the Savoy for repertory seasons between 1906 and 1909, in which year C. H. Workman took over the management of the theatre. He produced, among other works, Gilbert's final opera, with music by German, \"Fallen Fairies\" in 1909–10, which ran for only 51 performances. He also produced \"Two Merry Monarchs\" and \"Orpheus and Eurydice\" in 1910, the latter of which starred Marie Brema and Viola Tree in the title roles. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company did not play in the theatre from 1909 until 1929, instead touring throughout Britain and playing London seasons in other theatres; other works held the stage of the Savoy. George Augustus Richardson managed the theatre from November 1911 to February 1915. \"The Mikado's\" record as the Savoy's longest-running production was broken by the comedy \"Paddy the Next Best Thing\", which played for 867 performances from April 1920.\n\nIn 1915 Richard D'Oyly Carte's son, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, took over management of the theatre. After serving in the navy in World War I, Carte decided to bring the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company back to London in first-rate style. He began to mount seasons of updated and refreshed Gilbert and Sullivan productions at first at the Prince's Theatre in 1919. J. B. Fagan's adaptation of \"Treasure Island\" first played in December 1922 at the Savoy Theatre with Arthur Bourchier as Long John Silver. It was so popular that it was revived every Christmas until the outbreak of World War II.\nOn 3 June 1929 Carte closed the Savoy Theatre, and the interior was completely rebuilt to designs by Frank A. Tugwell with elaborate décor by Basil Ionides. The ceiling was painted to resemble an April sky; the walls, translucent gold on silver; the rows of stalls were all richly upholstered in different colours, and the curtain repeated the tones of the seating. Ionides said that he took the colour scheme from a bed of zinnias in Hyde Park. The entire floor space had been replanned: the old cloakrooms and bar at the back of the theatre were relocated to the side, and instead of 18 boxes there was now only one. The new auditorium had two tiers leaving three levels: stalls, dress, and upper circle. The capacity of the old house, originally 1,292, had been reduced to 986 by 1912, and the new theatre restored the capacity almost completely, with 1,200 seats. The new stage was 29.3 feet wide, by 29.5 feet deep.\n\nThe theatre reopened on 21 October 1929 with a new production of \"The Gondoliers\" designed by Charles Ricketts and conducted by Malcolm Sargent. In the only box sat Lady Gilbert, the librettist's widow. There were Gilbert and Sullivan seasons at the Savoy Theatre in 1929–30, 1932–33, 1951, 1954, 1961–62, 1975, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. Other famous works presented at the Savoy included the première of Noël Coward's \"Blithe Spirit\" (1941, which ran 1,997 consecutive performances, setting a new record for non-musical theatre runs), Robert Morley in \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\", and several comedies by William Douglas-Home starring, among others, Ralph Richardson, Peggy Ashcroft, and John Mills. The long-delayed first public performance in England of Oscar Wilde's \"Salome\" played at the theatre in 1931.\n\nAfter Rupert D'Oyly Carte died in 1948 his daughter, Bridget D'Oyly Carte, succeeded to the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and became a director and later president of the Savoy Hotel group, which controlled the theatre. Management of the theatre was assumed in 1948 by Sir Hugh Wontner, chairman of the Savoy hotel group. The theatre was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1973. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company closed in 1982, and Dame Bridget died childless in 1985, bringing the family line to an end. Wontner continued as chairman of the theatre until his death in 1992.\n\nWhile the theatre was being renovated in February 1990, a fire gutted the building, except for the stage and backstage areas. A proposal to build a new theatre in late 20th-century style was overruled by the Savoy's insurers and by English Heritage, the government body with oversight of listed buildings. It was decided to restore the building as faithfully as possible to the 1929 designs. Tugwell's and Ionides's working designs had been preserved, allowing accurate restoration of the theatre under the direction of the architect Sir William Whitfield, Sir Hugh Wontner and the theatre's manager, Kevin Chapple. It reopened on 19 July 1993, with a royal gala that included a specially commissioned ballet, \"Savoy Suite\", by Wayne Sleep to a score based on Sullivan's music. The present theatre has a capacity of 1,158. During the renovation, an extra storey was added above the theatre that includes a health club for the hotel and a swimming pool above the stage. The reopened theatre was the venue for the World Chess Championship in 1993, won by Garry Kasparov.\n\nIn 1993 Noël Coward's \"Relative Values\", played at the theatre, having premièred there in 1951, an original run of 477 performances. Tom Stoppard's \"Travesties\", with Antony Sher was next, and in 1994 the musical \"She Loves Me\" played, with Ruthie Henshall and John Gordon Sinclair. These were followed by Terry Johnson's \"Dead Funny\"; Alan Ayckbourn's \"Communicating Doors\" (which transferred to the theatre in 1996), with Angela Thorne; J. B. Priestley's \"When We Are Married\", with Dawn French, Alison Steadman, and Leo McKern; and Ben Travers' \"Plunder\", with Griff Rhys Jones and Kevin McNally. In 1997 a group led by Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen was given management of the theatre by The Savoy Group. Productions that followed included Simon Callow in \"The Importance of Being Oscar\"; Pet Shop Boys in concert; Ian Richardson in Pinero's \"The Magistrate\"; Edward Fox in \"A Letter of Resignation\"; the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of \"Richard III\", with Robert Lindsay; and Coward's \"Hay Fever\", with Geraldine McEwan in 1999.\nIn 2000 the briefly reconstituted D'Oyly Carte Opera Company produced \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" at the theatre. Donald Sutherland then starred in \"Enigmatic Variations\", followed by a second D'Oyly Carte season, playing \"The Pirates of Penzance\". In 2002, a season of \"Return to the Forbidden Planet\" was followed by the D'Oyly Carte productions of \"Iolanthe\", \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" and \"The Mikado\", and then a revival of Yasmina Reza's \"Life x 3\". In 2003, the company revived \"Pinafore\", followed by \"Bea Arthur at The Savoy\", John Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men\", \"Peter Pan\" and \"Pirates\". These were followed by \"The Marriage of Figaro\" and \"The Barber of Seville\" performed by The Savoy Opera Company in 2004. Next were seasons of Lorna Luft starring in \"Songs My Mother Taught Me\" and the new salsa musical \"Murderous Instincts\". Coward's \"Blithe Spirit\" was revived in 2004–05.\n\nThe Savoy Hotel group, including the theatre, was sold in 2004 to Quinlan Private which, in turn, sold the theatre in 2005 to the Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG) and the Tulbart Group (selling the Savoy Hotel to Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal). Productions since then have been mostly revivals and transfers of modern musicals; major productions have included \"\" and a new musical theatre version of \"Porgy and Bess\", directed by Trevor Nunn (both in 2006), \"Fiddler on the Roof\" (2007–08), \"Carousel\" (2008–09), \"Legally Blonde\" (2010–12), \"Let It Be\" (2013–14), \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\" (2014–15), \"Gypsy\" (2015), \"Funny Girl\" (2016) and \"Dreamgirls\" (2016–).\n\nIn December 2013, ATG acquired sole ownership of the Savoy.\n\n"}
{"id": "6288907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6288907", "title": "The Ballad of Little Jo", "text": "The Ballad of Little Jo\n\nThe Ballad of Little Jo is a 1993 American western film inspired by the true story of a society woman who tries to escape the stigma of bearing a child out of wedlock by going out to the West, and living disguised as a man. The film stars Suzy Amis, Bo Hopkins, Ian McKellen, David Chung, Heather Graham, Carrie Snodgress and Melissa Leo, and was written and directed by Maggie Greenwald.\n\nRoger Ebert described the film as depicting a culture in which \"men of poor breeding lived and worked together in desperate poverty of mind and body, and were so enclosed inside their roles that they hardly knew each other at all.\"\n\n\"The Ballad of Little Jo\" was nominated for the 1994 Independent Spirit Award for best female lead (Amis) and best supporting male (Chung).\n\nJosephine Monaghan (Amis) is a young society woman who is seduced by her family's portrait photographer, and as a result, bears an illegitimate child. She is expelled from her family and home in disgrace, and with no other resources, she leaves her newborn son under the care of her sister and heads West.\n\nOn the road, Josephine discovers that her options are very limited. As a single woman traveling alone, she is viewed with suspicion, or as sexual prey for any man. She assists a traveling salesman (René Auberjonois) who subsequently tries to sell her services as a whore to passing strangers. Seeing it as her only protection, Josephine scars her face, and begins to dress as a man – thus becoming \"Jo.\"\n\nAt a mining camp in Ruby City, she meets Percy (McKellen) who takes her under his wing. Percy recommends Jo for a job at the stable, and teaches her about how to survive in the frontier. But Percy nurses a deep suspicion of women, viewing them to be \"more trouble than they are worth.\" He later demonstrates his misogyny by slashing the face of a prostitute who refuses to give him oral sex.\n\nJo no longer feels safe with Percy or her secret, so she accepts a job herding sheep, and heads for the mountains. After returning in the spring, Percy gives Jo a letter for her that he had received months earlier. The letter is from Jo's sister, and Percy having opened it, now knows \"he\" is a \"she\". He is furious at being made a fool of by a woman and \"a whore at that,\" referring to the mention of her son in the letter. He attacks and tries to rape Jo, but she draws her gun and subdues him. Largely ostracized by the town's people since the incident with the prostitute, Percy promises Jo he will not share her secret if she finances his journey out of the territory. She agrees, though swears to him she will find him and kill him if he breaks his silence.\n\nFor five years she works as a shepherd, braving the deadly winters alone to the worry of her employer, Frank Badger (Hopkins), who has taken a liking to the \"young man\" he nicknames \"Little Jo.\" When Jo has enough money saved, she quits Badger, and buys her own homestead.\n\nWhile frequently viewed as \"peculiar\", Jo is clearly educated, and earns the respect of the people in Ruby City and the surrounding territory. A local girl, Mary, (Graham) has her eye on Jo. Blind to the truth, most hope the two will court. However, Mary ends up wedding her cousin, Lucas Brown, soon after Jo returns from her first winter as a sheep herder.\n\nOne day in town, Jo comes across a mob about to lynch a Chinese laborer for trying to \"take our jobs.\" Jo intervenes, and Badger insists the \"chinaman\", Tinman Wong (David Chung), go to live with Jo to help with the homestead.\n\nTinman accompanies Jo to the homestead, and takes on the duties of cook and housekeeper. Though he seems slow-witted, Jo is not happy at having company forced upon her, and is afraid he will discover she is not a man. She keeps as much distance as possible. But Tinman easily discovers the truth about Jo, and in doing so, reveals he is far more intelligent than he has pretended to be—he, too, has been masquerading for his own safety. Jo drops her guard and the two begin a love affair.\n\nA feud begins to brew between the sheep herders and cattlemen who are moving into the territory. The Western Cattle Company wants to buy up all the land in the area, and they kill anyone who does not comply. One by one, the sheep herders give in, or are murdered by masked gunmen. Jo has witnessed the brutal murders of too many of her friends, and the violence that will be necessary to win this kind of fight goes against her gentle nature. This is a masculine quality that goes beyond her ability to \"pass,\" so Jo dons a dress once again in a feeble effort to step back into a more traditionally feminine role. Tinman argues that it will be impossible for her to go back being the society woman, urging her to keep the homestead, and stand against the cattlemen in the upcoming election. Jo will not be swayed, and meets with the representative from the cattle company, Henry Grey (Anthony Heald) to tell him she will sell.\n\nTinman falls ill, and Jo summons Badger's wife (Snodgrass), who practices folk medicine, to tend him. Badger comes along, and is furious when Grey arrives with his wife so that Jo can sign the final papers for the sale of the homestead. Feeling betrayed by Jo for helping the cattle company to \"squeeze me,\" Badger hits Jo, proclaiming, \"By God, boy! I thought you'd amount to something.\"\n\nAs Grey prepares the papers inside, Jo watches his wife who, through the warped glass, is visually reminiscent of Jo when she was a woman of society. In an instant, Jo changes her mind and refuses to sell to Grey, who leaves in disgust issuing less than veiled threats.\n\nTinman recovers, and on election day, Badger and Jo ride to Ruby City but are met by several of Grey's masked gunmen. Badger shoots one of the gunmen, but is wounded, so it is up to Jo to finish the fight. She kills the two remaining men, but the pain of the act of killing is clearly indicated on her face.\n\nThe plot jumps to many years later, after Tinman Wong has died. Jo collapses while fetching water, and Badger finds her in bed, near death. He takes her in his wagon to the Ruby City doctor, but she is dead before they arrive. As Badger buys rounds of drinks at the saloon in memory of Little Jo, the undertaker rushes in with his shocking discovery—Little Jo was a woman. The town elders rush back to the undertaker's to inspect. All stand around the preparation table in shock, all except Mrs. Addie (Cathy Haase), the saloon owner, who laughs and laughs.\n\nBadger is furious at the betrayal by his friend, and because Jo \"made a fool out of me.\" He goes back to her homestead, and as he tears the place apart in anger, comes across the letter from her sister, and a picture of her as she lived as a woman. In town, the people tie Jo's dead body to her horse for a photograph.\n\nThe final shot is of the newspaper story with the before-and-after photographs, and the headline, \"Rancher Jo Was a Woman.\"\n\n\nThe film has been criticized for reinforcing a feminized image of\nAsian males in American \nmass media.\n\nA musical adaptation, by Mike Reid and Sarah Schlesinger, debuted as part of the Steppenwolf Theater Company's 2000-2001 season.\n\n"}

It was looted by Napoleon Bonaparte and brought to Paris in 1808, being returned in 1815. Today it is held by and exhibited at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. \n\nThe panel, neither signed nor dated, was painted \"circa\" 1567, at about the same time as \"The Peasant Wedding\". The paintings are the same size and may have been intended as a pair or as part of a series illustrating peasant life. They are the two most outstanding examples of Bruegel's late style, which is characterized by his use of monumental Italianate figures.\n\nLike \"The Peasant Wedding\", it is likely that Bruegel intended this painting to have a moral sense rather than simply being an affectionate portrayal of peasant life. Gluttony, lust and anger can all be identified in the picture. The man seated next to the bagpipe player wears a peacock feather in his hat, a symbol of vanity and pride. The occasion for the peasants' revelry is a Saint's day, but dancers turn their backs on the church and pay no attention whatsoever to the image of the Virgin which hangs on the tree. The prominence of the tavern makes it clear that they are preoccupied with material rather than spiritual matters.\n\n"}

The inclusion of leopards and the loom offer further evidence that the painting is of Circe.\n\nAn oil study for \"The Sorceress\" (c. 1911, 61x51cm, in a private collection) shows a model with dark brown hair. For the final scene, Circe is depicted as a redhead.\n\n\n"}
