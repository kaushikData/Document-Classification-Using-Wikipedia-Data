It was painted between about 1634 and 1636 as a commission for Giulio Rospigliosi (later Pope Clement IX), who according to Gian Pietro Bellori dictated its detailed iconography. The identity of the figures remains uncertain, with differing accounts.\n\nThe painting is well known for giving its name to the \"A Dance to the Music of Time\" novel cycle, though this title is first seen in a Wallace Collection catalogue of 1913. Before that it was given titles referring to the Four Seasons. In the 1845 sale it was called \"La Danse des Saisons, ou l'Image de la vie humaine\".\n\nFour figures, holding each other by the hand, dance in a circle, as Time plays a lyre on the right. The scene is set in the early morning, with Aurora, goddess of dawn, preceding the chariot of Apollo the sun-god in the sky behind; the Hours accompany him and he holds a ring representing the Zodiac. According to Bellori, the subject was devised by Rospigliosi. The four dancers represented, beginning with the one at the back seen mostly from behind: Poverty, Labour, Riches, and Pleasure or Luxury. These represent a progression in human life, completed by Pleasure or Luxury leading to Poverty again. As the Four Seasons Poverty would be Autumn, Labour Winter, and so on. The suggestion of Anthony Blunt that, unusually for a group of the seasons, Autumn/Poverty at the rear of the group was male is now generally accepted, and the museum now describe him as Bacchus. This follows the story invented by Boitet de Frauville in his \"Les Dionysiaques\" that, responding to complaints from the Seasons and Time, Jupiter gave the world Bacchus and his wine in order to compensate for the miserable living conditions mortals must endure. André Félibien, the friend and biographer of Poussin, explained the picture in the same terms, except that where Bellori identified Summer with Luxury, Félibien said that it represented Pleasure. \n\nThese identifications are disputed by Malcolm Bull, at least as the original intention. He traces the iconography of the painting to the Late Greek poet Nonnus, reflected in the \"Hymne de l'Automme\" of Pierre de Ronsard. Nonnus' descriptions of the four seasons, as translated into French, are closely followed by Poussin: \"on the left is Spring, with a garland of roses in her hair; at the back is Autumn, whose hair has been cropped by the winds but whose brow is wreathed with olive branches; Winter is next, with her bound hair and shadowed face, and at the front is Summer, dressed in white with ears of corn in the braids of her hair.\" Bacchus himself appears, in his double aspect as a young and old figure, in the herma at left. Bull suggests that Rospigliosi, an intellectual and author with a taste for allegory, invented the other interpretation \"during or after its completion\", while Ingamells feels that \"Poussin was not unduly concerned with the precise identification of the figures\". \n\nThere are several pentimenti, including the removal of a second, larger, tree on the right between Winter/Labour and Time. The painting is in generally good condition, but has been retouched in places, including over the repair of a large L-shaped tear running right through the central group.\n\nAt the start of Anthony Powell's series of novels named after the painting, the narrator, Nicolas Jenkins, reflects on it in the first two pages of \"A Question of Upbringing\":\n\nIt passed from the Rospigliosi family to the Joseph Fesch collection in 1806, when it was taken to France for a period. It was then bought, along with several other paintings, by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, in the great Fesch sale in Rome in 1845. It then passed to his son, Sir Richard Wallace. It was exhibited in the Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3931502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3931502", "title": "Akeelah and the Bee", "text": "Akeelah and the Bee\n\nAkeelah and the Bee is a 2006 American drama film written and directed by Doug Atchison. It tells the story of Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer), an 11-year-old girl who participates in the Scripps National Spelling Bee, her mother (Angela Bassett), her schoolmates, and her coach, Dr. Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). The cast also features Curtis Armstrong, J.R. Villarreal, Sean Michael Afable, Erica Hubbard, Lee Thompson Young, Julito McCullum, Sahara Garey, Eddie Steeples, and Tzi Ma.\n\nThe film was developed over a period of 10 years by Atchison, who came up with the initial concept after seeing the 1994 Scripps National Spelling Bee and noting that a majority of the competitors came from well-off socioeconomic backgrounds. After completing the script in 1999, Atchison won one of the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting in 2000, which attracted producers Sid Ganis and Nancy Hult Ganis. After an initial inability to secure funding, the project got a second wind as a result of the success of the 2002 documentary film \"Spellbound\". Lionsgate Films undertook the production in 2004 and in the following year it was filmed in South Los Angeles on a budget of over $6 million.\n\nAtchison remarked that his theme for the film, deemed an inspirational film, was about overcoming obstacles despite difficult challenges along the way. He also said that he wanted to portray African Americans in a manner that was not stereotypical and tried to show how African American children incorporate some stereotypes. The film alludes to the importance of community as well as to problems black communities face. It also deals with esteem and stigma in school while criticizing the public school system. Cast members said that although the film was aimed at children, they considered it had important lessons for the parents as well.\n\nReleased in the United States on April 28, 2006, \"Akeelah and the Bee\" was positively received by critics and audiences. Reviewers praised its storyline and cast, lauding Palmer's performance, although a few critics panned the story as familiar and formulaic, and were critical of the portrayal of Asian-American characters. The film grossed $19 million, and received a number of awards and nominations, including the Black Reel Awards and the NAACP Image Awards. Film critics highly praised it for avoiding African-American stereotypes common in Hollywood films, while scholars were less favorable, even saying it reinforces some clichés.\n\nAkeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old spelling enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, a predominantly black school in South Los Angeles. She lives with her disgruntled widowed mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older brothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she sign up for the Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee, which she initially refuses. After being threatened for detention for the remaining of the semester, she gives in, enters the spelling bee, and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she is good enough to compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old Mexican American boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his Woodland Hills middle school.\n\nAt Woodland Hills, Akeelah meets Dylan Chiu, a Chinese American boy who had won second place at the past two national spelling bees. Contemptuous, he asks her to spell \"xanthosis\". When she starts with a \"z\", he tells her she needs a coach. At the conclusion of the spelling club meeting, Javier invites Akeelah to his birthday party. At the party, Akeelah nearly beats Dylan in Scrabble. The boy is reprimanded by his father for nearly losing to \"a little black girl\". After the party, Tanya is depressed over Terrence's bad behavior after getting caught by the police for acting out with his thugs, her husband's death after a criminal shot and killed him on his way home from work and concerned about her daughter's grades and frequent truancy. As she finds out about Akeelah going alone to Woodland Hills, she subsequently forbids Akeelah from participating in the upcoming state bee. To circumvent this prohibition, Akeelah forges her deceased father Samuel's signature on the consent form and secretly studies with Dr. Larabee. During the state bee, Tanya comes inside and interrupts her daughter before she can spell her word. Tanya relents after a side discussion with Dr. Larabee and Mr. Welch, especially giving Akeelah double chores for three months as a punishment for giving it a secret behind her back. Javier protects Akeelah from disqualification by stalling until she can return. Dylan, Javier and Akeelah advance to the Scripps National Spelling Bee.\n\nAs Christmas approaches, Akeelah goes out to buy Dr. Larabee a present, but when she meets him, he reveals that he is quitting being her coach because she reminds him of his deceased daughter Denise: being very sick caused her death and that caused his wife Patricia to move into another city. Instead, he gives Akeelah 5,000 flashcards to study. Without her coach, rejected by her best friend Georgia, and feeling the pressure from her neighborhood residents to make them proud, Akeelah loses her motivation. However, Tanya tells her that if she looked around her, she would realize that she has \"50,000 coaches\". Akeelah recruits her family members, classmates, teachers, friends, and neighbor Derrick T to prepare in earnest. After reuniting with Dr. Larabee, Akeelah goes to Washington, D.C. with him, along with Tanya, Georgia, Mr. Welch, and Devon, unaware that her coach has paid for four of their tickets. Georgia rekindles her friendship with Akeelah after she invites her. During the competition, Akeelah becomes a crowd favorite. After all the other competitors are eliminated, only Dylan and Akeelah remain. The two finalists are allowed a break, during which Akeelah overhears Dylan's father harshly pressuring him to win. Akeelah attempts to intentionally lose by deliberately misspelling \"xanthosis\". Dylan, knowing that Akeelah knows this word, intentionally misspells it as well. Dylan tells Akeelah that he wants a fair competition, rejecting his father's obsession to win. The two then proceed to spell every word listed by the judges in the hopes of winning the championship together, with Dylan earning a share of it by correctly spelling \"logorrhea\", much to his father's delight. Akeelah spells the last word on the list, \"pulchritude\", and the two are declared co-champions amidst a cheering crowd.\n\n\n\n\nErica Hubbard, Lee Thompson Young, and Julito McCullum portray Akeelah's sister and brothers Kiana, Devon, and Terrence, respectively. Dalia Phillips appears as Akeelah's teacher, Ms. Cross, and Eddie Steeples as Derrick T. Tzi Ma takes the role of Mr. Chiu, Dylan's father, while Wolfgang Bodison plays the children's father and Tanya's husband Samuel.\n\nDoug Atchison first had the idea of making a film about spelling bees after watching the Scripps National Spelling Bee of 1994 and noticing that most of the contestants had \"privileged backgrounds\". Atchison also considered spelling bees to contain \"all the drama and tension and entertainment value of a sporting event\", and felt that this could be made into a film. From this, he got the idea to write a script following the story of a child who had talent for spelling bee but was from a low-income neighborhood so did not \"have access to the resources or coaching to pursue it as these other kids had.\" He had the desire of making a \"\"Rocky\"-like story\" and although made it a \"dramatic\" plot, he declared it is \"essentially a sports movie\".\n\nAtchison started his screenplay in 1999, when he wrote a five-page treatment in about a month. In addition to the fact he was working on other projects, Atchison said he waited years before starting to write because he \"thought someone else would do it first.\" This did not happen, so he began to write by himself. Few changes were made in the process of transitioning from the original draft to the final product. One change was that at first, Akeelah's mother had a smaller role and Akeelah's father was alive. Also, Larabee had been an older man (72 years old), and a few characters were cut. However, Atchison has summarized that \"the steps she goes through, the friends she's got, those were always the same.\"\n\nIn 2000, Atchison submitted his script to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences along with about 4,500 others, in hopes of winning the Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting. Atchison's script ended up being one of five scripts selected, and he won the grant. Editor Glenn Farr, then a member of the committee, offered to edit Atchison's film as soon as it was finished. Producer Sid Ganis was also attracted to the story during the award presentation ceremony. Nancy Hult Ganis, Sid's wife who was interested in public education, encouraged him to follow through with the film.\n\nThe film was produced by Lionsgate Films, 2929 Entertainment, Starbucks Entertainment, Out of the Blue Entertainment, Reactor Films and Cinema Gypsy Productions, with a budget around $6–8 million. However, the Ganis couple found it difficult to secure funding for the film. In August 2001, Danny Llewelyn's Panoptic Pictures acquired the rights of Atchison's script. In 2002, documentary \"Spellbound\" was released and attracted attention to spelling bees, which, according to Hult Ganis, \"helped us in some way\". In November 2004, Lionsgate Films announced they would fund and distribute the film; and in collaboration with 2929 Entertainment they would co-finance the production. In January 2006, Starbucks announced a partnership with Lionsgate to market it.\n\nAnother factor in not having a studio attached before was Atchison's desire to direct it as he wanted to ensure his story would remain the one he envisioned. Several studios wanted to turn Larabee's character into a white character but Atchison felt \"it was important that Akeelah's mentor be someone that comes from her neighborhood, that looks like her.\" Lionsgate's President of Production Michael Paseornek agreed that Atchison should direct the script, claiming that he was the only person who could do it because the story \"was in his heart and in his mind\".\n\nFilming began in February 2005; the crew filmed for ten hours a day for thirty-one days. The eleven-year-old Palmer had to follow the United States' child labor laws, which necessitated spending at least three hours a day at school, one on recreation, and one at lunch. Nevertheless, Palmer appeared in almost every scene, about which Ganis commented, \"I honestly don't know how we figured it out, but we did\". To get the filming done on time, Atchison storyboarded the scenes ahead of time and chatted with cinematographer David Mullen, the production designer Warren Young, and Glenn Farr to compile a list of scenes. This way, the filming team began each day knowing what shots they would take, their order, and the performances scheduled for each day. Most of the filming took place in South Los Angeles, which Atchison picked as the filming location due to their low budget. Scenes were also filmed at the University of Southern California, Hollywood Palladium—which stood in for the Grand Ballroom of the Washington, D.C. Hyatt Hotel—and Venice High School.\n\nTo bring authenticity to the film's portrayal of spelling bees, George Hornedo, who competed in spelling bees in real life, was hired to play contestant Roman and be \"an unofficial technical consultant.\" Hornedo helped the actors to recreate \"certain habits and idiosyncrasies they do on stage to help them spell.\" Thus, Akeelah skipping rope to memorize the words was added as \"something that was normal for the spelling bee\" but Atchison tried to create it in a \"subtle\" way as he thought the audience could consider this unrealistic. Hornedo and other children who had never acted before were cast because of their authentic portrayals of nervous contestants; other kids, in Atchison's eyes, were \"too old in how they acted\". Also, Jacques Bailly, who won the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 1980 and is currently the contest's official pronouncer, since 2003, played himself in the film.\n\nTo further help the staff, Atchison asked Paige Kimball, director of the Scripps National Spelling Bee, to be a consultant. Kimball \"was amazed at not only at how precise it was in its recreation, but also how authentic the individuals and the casting for the event was.\" However, she and the organization did have some disagreements. Atchison has admitted that he originally created a more dramatic story than she wanted. However, he believed most of the disagreements were about technical procedures, \"things you wouldn't even notice\". For example, the children were originally sponsored by newspapers to compete, but Atchison felt this detail did not improve the story, so he removed it. There were some concerns about the screenplay, and Atchison changed some of them \"because [he] thought it didn't matter one way or another so [he] just made them happy.\"\n\nThe film features a musical score by Aaron Zigman, who wrote 45 minutes of compositions in two and a half weeks. He had planned to score \"Akeelah and the Bee\" over the holidays, but Lionsgate pushed its release date up, so Zigman was pressed for time to write the score. He drew inspiration from Fishburne's performance to write it. A soundtrack album consisting of 16 tracks was released by Lionsgate Records in a deal with BMG's RED Distribution on April 4, 2006. It peaked at number 193 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and reached the 19th and sixth spot on the \"Billboard\" Top Independent Albums and Top Soundtracks respectively. The original score, consisting of 37 tracks, was also released on April 4 as an iTunes exclusive.\n\nCommentators on \"Akeelah and the Bee\" opined it dealt with multiple themes, including race and racism, poverty, educational system, competition and sportsmanship, self-esteem, self-image, stigma, community, friendship, gender and sexism, age, class and classism, and empowerment. Atchison affirmed that its focus is not the spelling but \"a kid who learns what she's good at, becomes proud of that and doesn't want to hide it anymore. It's overcoming the fear of being great, before you can be great.\" Sid Ganis described it as a film \"about hope and doing great things against all the odds,\" while a \"New York Press\" reviewer declared it \"addresses the human condition\".\n\nAfter attending USC School of Cinematic Arts and working at a youth center in South Los Angeles, Atchison incorporated his experiences from the neighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who do well in school are said to be \"acting white\". As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities. These doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that \"Spelling Bee is for someone else\". She \"must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy,\" and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it \"empowers her to ... accomplish this task.\" Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, \"it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't seen people who look like her doing\". The director affirmed that African American children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated \"lies about black inferiority\", so he was interested in focusing on their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all audiences \"but particularly for kids of color to see a little black girl who does something powerful.\"\n\nThe director also attributed Akeelah's low-esteem and doubt of her own capacities to the public school system, where she is bullied and \"her intellectual curiosity is kind of crushed\". As such, Akeelah is portrayed as an \"undermotivated student\", who \"[u]nwilling to be stigmatized as a freak or a brainiac,\" avoids showing her abilities. According to Wesley Morris of \"The Boston Globe\", the film shows \"the contradiction gifted students feel in an inhospitable environment.\" Ann Hornaday from \"The Washington Post\" opined that Akeelah's sentence \"Why would I want to represent a school that doesn't even have doors on the toilets?\" is \"one of the film's many subtle critiques of the country's education policies.\" Writing in the \"English Journal\", Amanda L. Hodges said it suggests a new approach on teaching with the \"50,000 coaches\" part; she declared it deconstructs the image of teachers \"as those who keep order and disseminate knowledge\" and shows that \"[t]eaching is not an isolated activity that begins and ends at the classroom door.\"\n\nVillarreal commented that the film \"teaches you not to let your friends down\", while Fishburne believed that the theme of community was important. Marrit Ingman of \"The Austin Chronicle\" said the film indicates \"a community-based, cooperative model of group success,\" while Justin Chang of \"Variety\" said it \"focuses ... on the bee's community-uniting impact.\" Hodges said Akeelah goes to the spelling bee because she recognizes it \"proves that someone from their neighborhood can achieve success, and her achievement is, in a real sense, their own\". In contrast, Bernard Beck wrote for \"Multicultural Perspectives\" that it depicts \"the success of individual perseverance\", while \"Red Feather Journall\"s Kathryn Linder expressed a similar opinion about individual success. Nevertheless, Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" commented \"it raises important points about the ... obstacles to success that kids from poor neighborhoods face.\" The \"New York Press\"s reviewer went further and said social class was its \"real subject\" as it \"depicts the basics of class mobility that are routinely taken for granted\". However, Chang asserted it shows the spelling bee contest as \"a democratizing force\", while Rob Asghar, for \"The Seattle Times\", wrote it treats English as \"the quintessential American tool for success.\"\n\nBoth Fishburne and Bassett also remarked that an important message of \"Akeelah and the Bee\" is to \"speak properly\" rather than strictly in vernacular, although Bassett emphasized the importance of the film's themes beyond spelling and spelling bees. Atchison added that beyond learning how to spell words, Akeelah must learn the importance of the words. He said that Larabee \"looks at Akeelah as a potential leader. He wants her to understand her history. She needs to know the importance of language – and competition.\" In spite of knowing its importance, it \"deconstruct[s] the 'competition' paradigm of learning\", according to Ingman. Fishburne noted not only children but parents can learn from the film; in his opinion, the most important is that they should pay attention to their children's abilities. Villarreal also felt that, through Dylan's father, parents would be able to ponder if they are \"push[ing] their kids to follow their own dreams and not the children's dreams.\"\n\nThe film was promoted by coffee shop chain Starbucks as a result of a partnership between Lions Gate Entertainment and Starbucks Entertainment. In January 2006, approximately 8,300 Starbucks locations in the United States and Canada began a promotional campaign for the film involving spelling-related trivia games and promotions on cardboard cup sleeves. \"Variety\" stated that Lionsgate spent around $20 million with its market only, while \"Los Angeles Times\" reported a $25 million cost to both produce and market the film. Ford Motor Company also sponsored the film by providing a Lincoln Zephyr to chauffeur the cast and creators to and from a screening.\n\"Akeelah and the Bee\" was first shown at the 2006 ShoWest on March 14, and later premiered as the opening film at the 30th Cleveland International Film Festival on March 16. On April 20, the film was screened at The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, and it had a sneak preview in 900 theaters on April 22. With predictions of strong box office returns by film critics, it was released nationwide in theaters on April 28, grossing $6,011,585 in its opening weekend from around 2,195 American theaters and ranking eighth at the box office. The film closed its run on July 14 and 20 domestically and internationally respectively, with $18,848,430 domestically and $110,994 internationally. While the film received positive reviews, critics noted that it was not doing as well financially as they had predicted, and Lionsgate's Michael Burns characterized the film's gross with the word \"only\".\n\nOutside the United States, the film debuted at the Sprockets Toronto International Film Festival for Children on April 23, 2006, where it was elected the best film by the kids in the ages of 10 and 11. In the United Kingdom, \"Akeelah and the Bee\" was first shown at the Cambridge Film Festival on July 7, and it premiered in the British theaters on August 18. The film was also screened in October 2006 at the Rome Film Festival, in which it competed at the Alicy in the City section.\n\nThe film was released on DVD by Lionsgate Home Entertainment on August 29, 2006, becoming the first DVD offered for sale at Starbucks. Its bonus features on the single-disc DVD include seven deleted scenes and a 25-minute making-of video featuring Atchinson and the cast. DVD sales in the United States reached $5,391,947 as 317,942 copies were sold after one week on sale. By December 2006, American consumers had spent a total of $25,855,396 to purchase 1,512,498 copies, making it one of the three most profitable home video releases of Lionsgate in 2006.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from film critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 84% approval rating based on 138 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A warm, family-friendly underdog story, featuring terrific supporting performances from Keke Palmer, Laurence Fishburne, and Angela Bassett.\" On Metacritic, the film has an average weighted score of 72 out 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare average grade of \"A+\".\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote it is \"an uncommonly good movie, entertaining and actually inspirational\". Writing for \"Film Journal International\", Doris Toumarkine praised its pace and how \"Atchison takes spelling competitions and conveys the excitement of the 'sport,' the appeal of the 'game,' the thrill of the win, [and] the crushing blow of the loss.\" Hornaday from \"The Washington Post\" called the film \"a triumph on many levels\" and proclaimed, \"It's that nod to the collective ... that makes \"Akeelah and the Bee\" so special.\" She especially appreciated that South Los Angeles was presented without stereotypes. Jane Clifford of \"U-T San Diego\" felt the film would appeal to both children and adults, and stated that every time she tried to predict its plot \"it took a sharp turn. A turn that leaves you facing your stereotypes and feeling a little sheepish.\" Dana Stevens, writing for \"The New York Times\", asserted, \"The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee,\" and \"a trio of crack performances\" can turn \"a formulaic sports picture\" into a \"tale that manages to inspire without being sappy.\" Shantayaé Grant of \"The Jamaica Observer\" wrote that \"acting is spectacular, the emotions are real and this story of black triumph is simply phenomenal.\" \"New York Press\" critic affirmed that \"Akeelah and the Bee\" \"resurrects a nearly lost idea of what an art-movie really is\" because it has \"dramatic attention to character and place, psychology and existence.\"\n\nChang of \"Variety\" commented that it \"plays like \"The Karate Kid\" with a pro-literacy agenda, pushing all the right emotional buttons yet hitting quite a few wrong ones in the process.\" The \"Evening Chronicle\"s review said it \"conceals few narrative surprises\" but contended that \"when [Atchison] does finally defy our expectations, it's to ensure his spellers learn a valuable lesson about integrity.\" Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" criticized that the film \"telegraphs its plot\"; however, he praised it as \"genuinely sweet and determinedly inspirational.\" \"PopMatters\"s Cynthia Fuchs stated it is formulaic as it has some \"conventions that make so many other genre films feel stale,\" but that it \"torques them slightly\", emphasizing the \"intellectual activities\" Akeelah gets involved with. Furthermore, the film was described as \"derivatively entertaining in a feel-good sort of way\" by Rick Groen in an article for \"The Globe and Mail\". Ingman of \"The Austin Chronicle\" described it as a typical sports film and felt it was heavy-handed at times. However, she praised it for its themes and called the film a \"[t]houghtful, engaging,\" one and said it has \"cross-gender appeal\". Morris of \"The Boston Globe\" argued, \"If \"Akeelah and the Bee\" is a generic, well-oiled commercial contraption, it is the first to credibly dramatize the plight of a truly gifted, poor black child.\" Morris added, \"Obviously, it's emotional propaganda. But it's just the kind of propaganda our children need.\"\n\nDespite being a \"critically acclaimed\" film, according to Rotten Tomatoes, not all of its reviews were this positive. Anna Smith of \"Empire\" called it \"formulaic and all-American\", commenting that many scenes \"appear functional rather than inspirational\", and that the film focused on the racial issue \"a little too heavily\". Smith stated, \"clunky plotting and characterisation mean it has 'telemovie' written all over it.\" Marc Mohan from \"The Oregonian\" stressed it can be compared to after-school specials due to its \"lack of originality in plot and character.\" \"Time Out\"s Jessica Winter also drew a comparation to after-school specials, saying \"on the big screen ... its clichés seem bigger and its characterisations broader than they would on the more forgiving telly.\" Nick Schager of \"Slant Magazine\" lamented that the \"clichés are too numerous to mention\", while Neil Smith from BBC asserted it has \"as much ... fantasy as \"Lord of the Rings\".\" Jan Stuart of \"Newsday\" deemed it \"virtually suspense-free, while Robert Hanks of \"The Independent\" stated it has an important message but that is a \"shame it couldn't be encased in a less faked-up story\". Commenting on \"The Times\", Chris Ayres stressed that although it has good \"visual flair\" it \"is ruined by its \"Oprah\"-style emotional manipulation.\" \"New York Post\"s Kyle Smith deemed it as \"uplifting but unimaginative\", suggesting that \"\"Akeelah and the Bee\" is so warm and well-meaning that you may find yourself wanting to like it more than you really do.\"\n\nIn spite of criticism, cast members' performances were usually well received – in particular, Palmer's portrayal of Akeelah. Ebert said, \"The movie depends on her, and she deserves its trust.\" Hornaday opined that \"Palmer's Akeelah is that cinematic \"rara avis\", the kid who is cute without being too cute, sympathetic without being cloying, and believable without being tiresome.\" \"Evening Chronicle\" stated Palmer does it \"with effortless grace\" and that she \"carries the film and doesn't strike a single wrong emotional note.\" Fuchs felt that most of the film's strengths \"have to do with Palmer's winning performance.\" Ingman declared Atchison's \"ensemble is wonderful, and his star, Palmer, is a fantastically assured young actress who conveys Akeelah's maelstrom of 11-year-old feelings with no apparent effort.\" Turan complimented how Fishburne and Bassett's \"presence and ability give this film a welcome integrity.\" Mohan stated, \"Although Fishburne and Bassett can do these roles in their sleep, the kids are actually quite engaging.\" Tourmakine felt there were \"fine performances all around\" and that Fishburne and Bassett \"lend fine support in utterly believable roles\".\n\nChang called Dylan's father \"a stiff Asian stereotype\", while Mohan of \"The Oregonian\" found it contradictory for an anti-racist film to contain such depiction. Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" even claimed that the line \"If you can barely beat a little black girl\" (spoken by Dylan's father) signifies that Atchison \"thinks it's all right to bring in racism by making the Asians the racists.\" \"Metro Silicon Valley\"s Richard von Busack commented that \"[s]tepping around black stereotypes, the film squishes its two left feet right in the mire of Asian stereotyping.\" Beth Accomando of KPBS also criticized Dylan and his father's portrayal as \"painful cliches\", while Schager of \"Slant Magazine\" found it not authentic, even likening Dylan's father to Mao Zedong.\n\nScholars Charise Pimentel and Cathleen Sawyer from the Texas State University published an article titled \"\"Akeelah and the Bee\": Inspirational Story of African-American Intellect and Triumph or Racist Rhetoric Served Up On Another Platter?\" on the May 2011 issue of journal \"Multicultural Perspectives\". On a critical discourse analysis, the authors argue that despite appearing to be an \"inoccent enough\" film, it has major approaches that make it racist. First, it implies that African-Americans needs to be rescued by others; second, depicts African-Americans community as \"marked by homelessness, poverty, criminality, unemployment, and remnants of gang activity\"; third, indicates that black people usually only achieve success through sports by \"linking the very essence of Akeelah's phenomenal ability to spell to her rhythmic abilities\"; and shows that African-Americans only can succeed outside their communities, \"far from the oppressive clutches of their own.\"\n\nLinder, on her September 2011 paper \"Spelling Out Racial Difference: Moving Beyond the Inspirational Discourses in \"Akeelah and the Bee\"\", also criticizes it saying it \"acts as a platform for a racial melodrama through which ideals of whiteness are reinforced and strengthened.\" Using Linda Williams' categories of what constitutes a racial melodrama, Linder argues that it is described as an \"inspirational\" film because of \"[its] portrayal of Akeelah's victimization by the black community that surrounds her\" and of redemption only achieved \"through the idealized discourse of young people's educational success as defined by dominant (white) culture.\" Linder said characters \"are mostly represented as having 'no interest in escape' from societal oppressions and limitations\" and that \"there is no sign throughout the film of any kind of lasting change for Akeelah's school or her young peers.\"\n\nLinder affirms that it creates a dichotomy between \"success (whiteness) versus failure (blackness).\" Pimentel and Sawyer, as well as Linder, identify Larabee as the one who makes this separation clear when he manifests his disregard of African American Vernacular English. The co-authors wrote that Larabee implies that \"legitimate forms of intelligence can only be achieved through a Eurocentric perspective, thus advancing the message that Akeelah must be rescued from her African-American ways of knowing, in order to be considered intellectual.\" Another contraposition commented by scholars was \"between the supportive Dr. Larabee and Akeelah's skeptical mother.\" Pimental and Sawyer said she is portrayed as \"an African-American obstructionist\", while scholar Gloria Ladson‐Billings asserted she represents the stereotype of \"ignorant Black woman\". Although Fuchs said the film was able to avoid the \"white authority figure saves the underclass child\" plotline by introducing Larabee, Ladson‐Billings, Linder, and Pimentel and Sawyer opined that it did not. After all, Larabee, as Linder described, is \"a non-threatening black man who has assimilated to white culture and who can be depended on to help assimilate others\".\n\nThe film was nominated for six Black Reel Awards, winning only Best Actress for Palmer. Out of five NAACP Image Awards nominations, \"Akeelah and the Bee\" won Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture and Outstanding Writing in a Feature Film/Television Movie - Comedy or Drama. At the Black Movie Awards, it won the five awards it was nominated for. The same happened during the Young Artist Awards where it was nominated for two categories and won two awards, and at the CAMIE Awards where it was nominated for and won an award. The film was also nominated for but did not win any award from the BET Awards, Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, Chicago Film Critics, and Satellite Awards. National Board of Review elected it among the best ten independent films produced in 2006. Additionally, two film critics, Chris Kaltenbach of \"The Baltimore Sun\" and Carrie Rickey of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", added the film on their list of the ten best films of the year. \"St. Petersburg Times\"s Steve Persall elected it the best family film of 2006.\n\n\n"}

More recently, as with other types of blogs, some art blogs have taken on 'web 2.0' social networking features. Art blogs that adopt this sort of change can develop to become a source of information on art events (listings and maps), a way to share information and images, or virtual meeting ground.\n\nArt blogs entries cover different topics, from art critiques and commentary to insider art world gossip, auction results, art news, personal essays, portfolios, interviews, artists’ journals, art marketing advice and artist biographies. Some artists use art blogs as a form of new media art project.\n\nArt blogs may also serve as a forum to reach out to anybody interested in art — be it painting, sculpture, print making, creative photography, video art, conceptual art or new media. In this way, they may be visited not only for the practitioners of different forms of art, but also collectors, connoisseurs, and critics.\n\nIn 2011, art critic Brian Sherwin interviewed art critic Mat Gleason of Coagula Art Journal for Faso.com's FineArtViews blog. The interview between Sherwin and Gleason focused on contemporary art criticism and the role of art blog’s in present-day art criticism among other issues. Gleason suggested to Sherwin that art blogs and the development of new media have become a \"\"blow\" to traditional print art magazines. Gleason and Sherwin also discussed how bloggers form a \"pack mentality\"\" based on region and perceived significance.\n\nOn April 28, 2009, Art Connect produced an in-depth interview by Peter Cowling for Art Connect and Jessica Palmer of Bioephemera. The interview, titled It is not Really Bloggers vs. Journalists, You Know, pointed to five trends that were shaping the communication and discussion of art on the internet, and that the real picture was much bigger than just the bloggers vs. journalists that had been discussed to date. These five points were:\n\n\nOn January 8, 2009, Regina Hackett, art critic of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, noted in her article Art Blogs Hit Wikipedia that commercially run, mainstream media supported, art blogs face issues of acceptance among the independent art blogging community.\n\nOn January 7, 2009, \"The Village Voice\" art critic Martha Schwendener suggests that art blogs have helped shape a more laissez-faire climate for art writing. \"Art blogs have created a new, largely unedited, admirably 'unprofessional'—hence, democratic—venue for people to speak their minds, gossip, or theorize about art.\"\n\nIn September 2008, the \"Brooklyn Rail\" contributor James Kalm produced an article titled \"Virtually Overwhelmed.\". A practicing artist and video blogger himself, Kalm has this to say about art blogs, \"The art blogosphere is a work in progress, and you’ve got to be vigilant of hidden agendas. As with anything online, take it with a grain of salt. Have fun, speak out, but don’t let it cut too much into your studio time; you might end up in a twelve step-program.\"\n\nIn the November 2007 issue of \"Art in America\", Peter Plagens contributed \"Report from the Blogosphere: The New Grass Roots.\" Plagens convened a round table of veteran art bloggers, who conversed via email on a range of questions, aimed at getting a better understanding of what art blogs were, how they were run, and their relationship with the mainstream media.\n\nIn an October 2007 article for artnet Magazine, critic Charlie Finch suggested that art critiques and reviews by art bloggers are overrated and lengthy, and implied that the art blogging community was overly insular. The article includes several \"ad hominen\" arguments against specific art bloggers, and ventures the opinion that art blogs \"have no readers\".\n\nIn the January 2005 issue of \"Art in America\", Raphael Rubinstein mentioned several blogs in the magazine's \"Front Page\" section, where he penned a brief, annotated survey of 12 art blogs that he found \"to be worth regular visits.\". Rubinstein opined that \"art-related blogs\" had not, at the time, become as consequential as blogs in other fields such as poetry or politics.\n\nIn December 2008, the art blog The Dump, where the new-media artist Maurice Benayoun dumped hundreds of undone art projects, was the first to become a doctorate thesis in art and art science in and of itself: \"Artistic Intentions at Work, Hypothesis for Committing Art\" Université Pantheon Sorbonne (December 6, 2008)\nThis PhD was directed by Prof. Anne-Marie Duguet. Jury : Prof. Hubertus von Amelunxen, Louis Bec, artist, Prof. Derrick de Kerckhove, and Prof. Jean da Silva.\n\nIn May 2010, \"The Dump – Recycling of Thoughts\", a contemporary art exhibition curated by Agnieszka Kulazińska at Laznia Art Center (Gdańsk, Poland) presented 9 artists whose works were derived from \"The Dump\" blog project list.\n\nOther coverage of art blogs includes interviews of art bloggers, reviews of art blog site, and recommendations of favourite sites.

Made with tempera on silt plaster using a \"al secco\" fresco technique, it depicts Petros, the bishop of Faras between 974 and 997. The anonymous work was discovered in the ruins of Faras Cathedral, an important religious centre of Nubia, in modern Sudan. Rescued from flooding when Lake Nasser was created, since 1964 it is part of the Faras Gallery of the National Museum in Warsaw.\n\nThe painting, which used to be part of a larger composition, representing King Georgios II of Makuria with the Virgin and Child, was painted on the west wall of the chapel located in the southern nave of the cathedral. The portrait of the bishop was placed to the right of the image of the king. The representation of the two highest hierarchs of the state along with their patron saints indicated the supernatural origin of the power of the nobles and symbolized the unity of the clerical and secular power.\n\nThe image was created in Petros' lifetime, which is suggested by the inscription in Greek accompanying the painting, wishing him \"many years [of life]\". The painting is considered one of the most precious images of Nubian officials found in the Cathedral of Faras and is also one of six best preserved portraits of bishops discovered there.\n\nThe painting, like most other pieces of in the of the National Museum in Warsaw, was recovered by Polish archaeologists during the so-called Nubian Campaign, an international effort led by UNESCO prior to construction of the Nasser Dam. The excavations, carried out between 1961 and 1964, discovered a religious complex in the town of Faras (ancient Pachoras), near modern Sudanese-Egyptian border. Well-preserved ruins of a large Christian cathedral from 7th to 14th centuries contained well-preserved wall religious paintings.\n\nSince the area was to be flooded by the waters of the artificial Lake Nasser, a team of Polish archaeologists led by Kazimierz Michałowski was allowed to recover the artifacts. A major part was then transported to the National Museum of Sudan, where a team of Polish scientists led by Józef Gazy carried out . Some 40 per cent were transported to the National Museum of Warsaw, becoming the nucleus of the future Faras Gallery.\n\nThe image itself was painted by an anonymous artist some time during bishop Petros' tenure, between 974 and 999 AD. It represents the so-called yellow and red style, typical of a transitional period between the white style of 9th century and later multicolour style introduced in the 11th century and typical of all later wall paintings at Faras until its abandonment in the 14th century. Other images representative of the yellow and red style found at Faras represent King Georgios, a \"Virgin and Child\", \"Three Men in the Fiery Furnace\", as well as a Passion Cycle. The red and yellow style paintings are considered among the most interesting, both visually and for their theological message.\n\nThe dark-skinned bishop is depicted wearing his liturgical robes, complete with a narrow, white handkerchief (\"encheiron\") wound around the index finger of his right palm. With it he points at a Gospel Book he holds in his other arm.\n\nPetros is dressed in a long white robe (\"sticharion\") with vertical green stripes. His yellow \"phelonion\" (a type of chasuble), in the shape of an elongated ellipse, is adorned with a pattern of a red net, with precious stones sewn into the fabric. The edge of the chasuble is also adorned with a strip of fabric with green and red jewels. Bishop's \"epitrachelion\" is decorated with yellow wheels with a green circuit and red rectangles. The \"omophorion\", one of symbols of episcopal dignity, is white with a pattern of circles and rectangles. The head of the bishop is wrapped in a turban characteristic of the Coptic Church hierarchs, which could suggest that Petros was a monophysite.\n\nBehind the bishop stands Saint Peter the Apostle, dressed in a white crown signifying martyrdom. The saint has both hands on the shoulders of the bishop. This pose, common in Nubian painting of the epoch, signifies the fact that the saint protects and supports the bishop, but also points at the supernatural character of bishop's power.\n\nAround the head of Saint Peter there is a black inscription in Greek: SAINT PETER THE APOSTLE MARTYR OF THE CROSS ABBA PETROS BISHOP AND METROPOLITAN OF PACHORAS [may he live] MANY YEARS.\n\n"}

It contains the Vulgate translation of the four Gospels written on vellum in Carolingian minuscule with Square and Rustic Capitals and Uncials as display scripts. The manuscript has 219 extant folios which measure approximately 330 by 230 mm. The text is written in area of about 205 by 127 mm. In addition to the text of the Gospels, the manuscript contains the letter of St. Jerome to Pope Damasus and of Eusebius of Caesarea to Carpian, along with the Eusebian canon tables. There are prologues and capitula lists before each Gospel. A table of readings for the year was added, probably between 1675 and 1749, to the end of the volume. This is followed by a list of capitula incipits and a word grid which were added in the Carolingian period.\n\nThe codex was produced at the Monastery of St. Martin at Tours between 820 and 830, under the abbacy Fridugisus, who was the successor of Alcuin. It is the earliest known Gospel Book from Tours to contain four Evangelist portraits. The location of the book is uncertain until the 18th century. There is a book stamp on folio 1 that indicates that the volume belonged to Count Suchtelan, the Russian Ambassador to Stockholm in the 18th century. In the early 19th century it belonged to Lord Strangford. It was sold at Sotheby's in August 1831 and was purchased by Samuel Butler, Bishop of Lichfield. The British Library acquired the book along with the rest of Bishop Butler's collection of manuscripts.\n\nThe manuscript contains canon tables set within architectural arcades which are decorated with zoomorphic and foliate designs. There are four Evangelist portraits. Each evangelist is shown as a scribe and is identified by a half-length symbol above him and by an inscription. The portraits show some similarities to some Insular manuscripts and some Court School manuscripts, as might be expected given the nationality Fridugisus, who was English, and from his connections to the Carolingian court. The portraits have been described as being \"coarsely executed\". The manuscript also contains a decorated title page and incipit page for each gospel. There are also decorated major and minor initials. The major initials are done in early Franco-Saxon style and were done by a different artist than the one who did the portraits.\n\nThe volume still has its Carolingian treasure binding dating from the ninth century. The covers were refurbished in the 14th and 19th centuries. The covers are oak panels covered in embossed silver. The front cover has the figure of a seated Christ in Majesty enclosed within a rectangular frame decorated with stones and foliate designs. The majority of the medal work is 9th century typical of mid-ninth century Carolingian metalwork. In the four corners of the frame are enamels of the four evangelist symbols, which were added in the fourteenth century. The enamels were probably produced at Limoges. The original colored stones were replaced by jewels in 1838 for Bishop Butler. There are relics of finger bones from an anonymous saint embedded on the interior of the boards. The clasps for the volume were probably replaced in the 19th century.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6503287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6503287", "title": "Fix-up", "text": "Fix-up\n\nA fix-up (or fixup) is a novel created from several short fiction stories that may or may not have been initially related or previously published. The stories may be edited for consistency, and sometimes new connecting material, such as a frame story or other interstitial narration, is written for the new work. The term was coined by the science fiction writer A. E. van Vogt, who published several fix-ups of his own, including \"The Voyage of the Space Beagle\", but the practice (if not the term) exists outside of science fiction. The use of the term in science fiction criticism was popularised by the first (1979) edition of the \"Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\", edited by Peter Nicholls, which credited Van Vogt with the creation of the term.\nThe name comes from the modifications that the author needs to make in the original texts to make them fit together as though they were a novel. Foreshadowing of events from the later stories may be jammed into an early chapter of the fix-up, and character development may be interleaved throughout the book. Contradictions and inconsistencies between episodes are usually worked out.\n\nSome fix-ups in their final form are more of a short story cycle or composite novel rather than a traditional novel with a single main plotline. Examples are Ray Bradbury's \"The Martian Chronicles\" and Isaac Asimov's \"I, Robot\", both of which read as a series of short stories which may share plot threads and characters but which still act as self-contained stories. By contrast, van Vogt's \"The Weapon Shops of Isher\" is structured like a continuous novel although it incorporates material from three previous Van Vogt short stories.\n\nFix-ups became an accepted practice in the 1950s, when science fiction and fantasy—once published only in magazines—began appearing in book form. Large book publishers like Doubleday and Simon & Schuster entered the market, greatly increasing demand for fiction. Authors created new manuscripts from old stories to sell to publishers. Algis Budrys in 1965 described fixups as a consequence of the lack of good supply during the \"bad years for quality\" of the mid-1950s, although citing \"The Martian Chronicles\" and Clifford D. Simak's \"City\" as among exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "705267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=705267", "title": "In the Cut", "text": "In the Cut\n\nIn the Cut is a 2003 Australian-American mystery and erotic thriller film written and directed by Jane Campion and starring Meg Ryan, Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Campion's screenplay is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Susanna Moore. The film focuses on a college English professor who becomes entangled with a detective investigating a series of gruesome murders in her Manhattan neighborhood. \n\nThe film received a limited release on 22 October 2003 in the United States, and was subsequently given a wide release on Halloween that year in the United States and United Kingdom. The film received mixed to negative reviews from most critics.\n\nHigh school teacher and writer Frannie Avery meets a student at a local bar, and when she heads to the bathroom sees a woman performing oral sex on a man. A few days later, Detective Giovanni Malloy questions her as he investigates the gruesome murder of a young woman, whose severed limb was found in Frannie's garden. They flirt despite the grisly nature of their introduction, and meet at the same bar later. Frannie is alternately thrilled and frightened by the detective's sexual aggressiveness, even as she grows more disillusioned with the attitudes and crude behavior of other men, including the detective's partner, Richard Rodriguez. Even as Malloy defends his partner, who can no longer carry a gun because he threatened his unfaithful wife, he promises he will do anything she wants except hit her. She leaves abruptly and is assaulted walking home, but calls Malloy and their affair begins that night. \n\nFrannie recognizes the detective's tattoo, from the man in the basement of the bar, and asks her sister Pauline if she would trust a man who got a blow job in a bar. Pauline says yes, but Frannie is still suspicious. After Malloy tells her that she and the first victim were in the same bar the night of the murder, and she might have seen the murderer, she begins to suspect that Malloy may actually be the killer, especially after a second victim is found. But later she goes with him to a woodsy spot by the water, where he scares her by shooting at garbage bags floating on the surface, then tells her she should learn how to shoot. She surprises herself by taking aim and shooting well, before they head back to the city.\n\nShe finds her old boyfriend in her bed when she gets home, and goes back to her sister's apartment, where she finds the door open and Pauline's decapited head. She is now more frightened of Malloy than ever, but goes home and gets drunk, and almost stumbles into bed with her student before throwing him out. Malloy's partner is outside watching as the young man runs out, and Frannie shouts out the window that Malloy should stay away from her. But he comes over and helps her clean herself up, and she can't decide if she should trust him. So she cuffs him to a pipe and makes love to him, and as soon as she is done he starts rattling the cuffs, demanding to be set free. She is fishing in his jacket for the keys when she finds the missing charms from her bracelet, which he claims he found and was planning to return to her. She suddenly becomes very suspicious of him, and he gets scared and yells at her. She finally tells Malloy she saw his tattoo in the basement of the bar when he was getting a blow job, and she runs out, stumbling right into his partner's arms. Frannie tells Rodriguez what she saw, and he says they need to sit down and talk, so she gets in his car. Malloy's screams from the window are ignored.\n\nRodriguez drives her out to the Little Red Lighthouse below the George Washington Bridge, telling her this is the place he goes to fish, and she says, \"I teach that book, \"To the Lighthouse\".\" But as soon as he locks the gate behind them she knows she is in trouble, and he shows her the tattoo on his arm, the twin of Malloy's. She realizes Malloy is innocent, then she slips on his jacket before Rodriguez takes her in his arms. She shoots him once with Malloy's gun but he tries to strangle her before she can shoot him again; they fall, and he dies. She walks, bloodied, back to her apartment and lies down in the arms of the exhausted Malloy, still cuffed to the pipe where she left him.\n\n\nNicole Kidman and Jane Campion spent five years developing the film. This is Kidman's producing debut. Kidman was originally cast as Frannie, but dropped out because she was divorcing and needed more time with her children. This film was executive produced by Effie T. Brown, in association with Sony Screen Gems and Pathe International.\n\n\"In the Cut\" grossed $1,666,830 at the box office in Australia.\n\n\"In the Cut\" received mixed to negative reviews from critics, with a score of 34% from Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews from 147 critics and an average rating of 4.8 out of 10; the consensus reads: \"Ryan is very good playing against type, but Campion's good-looking thriller is far from thrilling.\" The film maintains a score of 46 out of 100 from 38 critics on Metacritic. CinemaScore gave it a rating of \"F\" based on surveys from general audiences.\n\nDespite the largely unfavorable reception, however, \"In the Cut\" was among the films discussed by Slavoj Žižek in \"The Pervert's Guide to Cinema\" (2006). Film critic David Thomson has also called it a masterpiece, and, in his book \"Moments That Made the Movies\", hails it as \"one of the great films of the twenty-first century\".\n\n\n"}

The association is headquartered in Los Angeles, but has a global membership and wide scope of services and advocacy. Its roster of 150 member companies in 23 countries include independent production and distribution companies, sales agents, television companies, studio-affiliated companies and financial institutions. IFTA members create more than 500 independent films and countless hours of TV programming each year generating a revenue of $4 billion annually.\n\nThe freedom for independents to create and distribute movies and television shows has been threatened by a handful of consolidated media companies that control programming and distribution. As the voice and advocate for the independent industry worldwide, IFTA continues to increase public awareness of the major issues facing independents and publicly represents the independent film industry on such matters as the threat to a competitive marketplace seen in media consolidation; net neutrality; the elimination of trade barriers; the impact of new technology on our traditional business models; anti-piracy; improvement of copyright protection around the world; and the need to foster broad-based growth of the industry.\n\nTo that end, IFTA executives meet regularly with Washington lawmakers to advocate on behalf of reasonable and limited regulations to restore balance in the television and cable marketplace. IFTA endorses the principles of \"net neutrality\" or open access to the Internet. Net neutrality is currently threatened if broadband providers are able to discriminate in favor of certain content or applications, potentially replicating the closed and vertically integrated structure with traditional programming and distribution platforms.\n\nIn December 2008, IFTA called on the new Obama Administration to appoint an FCC chairman and commissioners who support principles of openness and diversity in the media with an open letter to his transition team, including Julius Genachowski, who was confirmed as the new FCC chairman.\n\nIFTA lobbies against market barriers that impede the independents' ability to compete fully in national markets around the world, including import and censorship restrictions and weak copyright protection. IFTA is a member of the Center for Copyright Information (CCI), that aims to reduce online copyright infringement through a graduated response scheme called the Copyright Alert System.\n\nAccording to IFTA:\n\nAn independent film or television program is financed primarily from sources outside the seven major U.S. studios. Independent entertainment programming is made at every budget range, from mainstream commercial to art house, and is seen by the public side-by-side with major studio releases. IFTA's member companies are the independents who finance, license, and produce this programming.\n\nSome members of the IFTA are subsidiaries of the Big Six movie studios, such as New Line Cinema and HBO which is owned by Time Warner, and Focus Features which is owned by NBCUniversal.\n\nJean Prewitt became IFTA's President in April 2000 and was promoted to Chief Executive Officer in December 2001. Prior to joining IFTA, Prewitt was a senior government official and lobbyist for the film and entertainment industry for nearly ten years. Before her time in Washington DC, she was Senior Vice President and General Counsel of United International Pictures (the international distribution entity formed by then-Universal, Paramount and MGM-UA studios), managing international legal and government affairs.\n\nJonathan Wolf has been IFTA's Executive Vice President and Managing Director of the American Film Market since 1998. He joined IFTA in 1993 as Senior Vice President of Business Development. Before joining IFTA, Wolf served two years as President & COO of Studio Three Film Corporation, a U.S. theatrical distribution company.\n\nIn September 26, 2017 Michael Ryan was elected for a second two-year term as Chairman of the Alliance until 2019. Another appointments include Andrew Kramer (Lionsgate) as General Vice Chairperson and Clay Epstein as Vice Chairperson.\nJay Joyce, Lloyd Kaufman (Troma Entertainment), Charlotte Mickie and Almira Ravil continue to serve as members of the Executive Committee through their second year of their term. The Board of Directors include Tannaz Anisi, Paul Bales (The Asylum), Jason Buckley (Lakeshore Entertainment), Carl Clifton (Hyde Park International), Caroline Couret-Delegue, Kirk D'Amico (Myriad Pictures), Jeffrey Greenstein (Millennium Media), Lise Romanoff, Gabrielle Stewart, Jeannine Tang, Shaked Berenson (Epic Pictures Group), Tamara Birkemoe (Foresight Unlimited), Jody Cipriano (MarVista Entertainment), Alexandra Cocean (Voltage Pictures), Camela Galano, Brad Krevoy, Albert Lee, Nat McCormick, Michael Rothstein and Alison Thompson.\n\nA group of independent producers established the American Film Market and the AFM's parent, the non-profit American Film Marketing Association, in 1980 to expand the independent film business. In 2004, the organization changed its name and expanded its scope to include television with the formation of the Independent Film & Television Alliance.\n\nCollectively, independents produce the largest number of motion picture industry jobs, films and, over the past quarter century, Academy Award-winning movies. IFTA members have produced and distributed such Best Picture Oscar winners as \"Gandhi\" (1982); \"Amadeus\" (1984); \"Platoon\" (1986); \"The Last Emperor\" (1987); \"Driving Miss Daisy\" (1989); \"Dances with Wolves\" (1990); \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991); \"Braveheart\" (1995); \"The English Patient\" (1996); \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998); \"Chicago\" (2002); \"\" (2003); \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004); \"Crash\" (2004); \"The Departed\" (2006); \"No Country for Old Men\" (2007) \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (2008), \"The Hurt Locker\", (2009); \"The King's Speech\" (2010); and \"The Artist\" (2011).\n\nMost recently, some of the world's most prominent films were produced, distributed and financed by IFTA Members: \"Milk\" (2008); \"The Reader\" (2008); \"The Wrestler\" (2008); \"Doubt\" (2008); \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\" (2008); \"W\" (2008); \"Twilight\" (2008); \"Defiance\" (2008); \"I've Loved You So Long\" (2008); \"Burn After Reading\" (2008); \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009); \"Taken\" (2009); \"Paranormal Activity\" (2010); \"\" (2010); \"Insidious\" (2011); \"The Lincoln Lawyer\" (2011); \"The Hunger Games\" (2012); \"Now You See Me\" (2013).\n\nIFTA members, as well as the entire independent film industry, benefit from the American Film Market (AFM), which has grown into one of the world's largest film markets, as well as the organization's standard form contracts and publications.

The following year she completed Navy undersea medical officer training at the Naval Undersea Medical Institute in Groton, Connecticut, and diving medical officer training at the Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center in Panama City, Florida. Clark was designated a Radiation Health Officer and Undersea Medical Officer. She was then assigned as the Submarine Squadron 14 Medical Department Head in Holy Loch, Scotland. During that assignment she dove with Navy divers and Naval Special Warfare Unit Two SEALs, and performed many medical evacuations from US submarines. After two years of operational experience she was designated as a Naval Submarine Medical Officer and Diving Medical Officer.\n\nClark underwent six months of aeromedical training at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute st NAS Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida, and was designated as a Naval Flight Surgeon.

Milne.\n\nWritten in 1917, Milne's own introduction begins 'This is an odd book', and indeed it is very difficult to classify. Ostensibly a typical fairytale, it tells the story of the war between the kingdoms of Euralia and Barodia and the political shenanigans which take place in Euralia in the king's absence, all supposedly rewritten by Milne from the writings of the fictional historian \"Roger Scurvilegs\".\n\nMilne created the story to contain believable, three-dimensional characters, rather than the stereotypes which will satisfy children. Hence the book introduces us to a princess who is far from helpless; a prince who, whilst handsome, is also pompous and vain; an enchantment which is almost entirely humorous; a villain who is not entirely villainous and receives no real comeuppance; a good king who is not always good; an evil king who is not always evil, and so on. The result is a book which children may not enjoy as much as adults.\n\nThe book was written by Milne partly for his wife, upon whom the character of the Countess Belvane was partially based.\n\nWhen the King of Barodia receives a pair of seven-league boots as a birthday present, his habit of flying over the King of Euralia's castle during breakfast provokes a series of incidents which escalate into war. While the King of Euralia is away, his daughter Hyacinth tries to rule in his stead and counter the machiavellian ambitions of the king's favourite, the Countess Belvane.\n\nKing Merriwig of Euralia: fat, jolly if occasionally pompous and easily led. He nevertheless can show great strength of mind, as related in an anecdote in which he outwitted a fairy, mostly by sheer stubbornness.\n\nPrincess Hyacinth: Merriwig's daughter. Rather more savvy than her father, she is nevertheless at first out of her depth when trying to rule the kingdom in his absence. Despite this, she grows into the role.\n\nThe King of Barodia: Bombastic, proud and arrogant, and takes inordinate pride in his moustache.\n\nThe Countess Belvane: A difficult character. Beautiful, proud and haughty, she is inclined to melodramatics and emotional self-indulgence. Ostensibly the villain of the piece, her motives are complex and subtle.\n\nLady Wiggs: Hyacinth's closest friend; helpful and dreamy.\n\nLady Woggs: A palace servant; well-meaning but terribly dim.\n\nPrince Udo of Araby: Prince of a neighbouring realm, invited by Hyacinth to help her in her troubles with Belvane. He turns out to be very little help at all, partly due to suffering an embarrassing enchantment, but mostly due to his personality.\n\nCoronel: Udo's companion-at-arms and best friend. Far more laid-back and likeable than the prince.\n\nRoger Scurvilegs: Noted historian of Euralia, author of the monumental work \"Euralia Past and Present\". The narrator gives him credit for the basic facts of the story whilst gently lampooning him for his stuffiness.\n\nMilne himself resisted characterising the book. In his foreword to the 1922 edition he wrote of it:\n\n\"For whom, then, is the book intended? That is the trouble. Unless I can say, \"For those, young or old, who like the things which I like,\" I find it difficult to answer. Is it a children's book? Well, what do we mean by that? Is \"The Wind in the Willows\" a children's book? Is \"Alice in Wonderland\"? Is \"Treasure Island\"? These are masterpieces which we read with pleasure as children, but with how much more pleasure when we are grown-up. In any case, what do we mean by \"children\"? A boy of three, a girl of six, a boy of ten, a girl of fourteen - are they all to like the same thing? And is a book \"suitable for a boy of twelve\" any more likely to please a boy of twelve than a modern novel is likely to please a man of thirty-seven; even if the novel be described truly as \"suitable for a man of thirty-seven\"? I confess that I cannot grapple with these difficult problems. But I am very sure of this: that no one can write a book which children will like, unless he write it for himself first. That being so, I shall say boldly that this is a story for grown-ups. [...] But, as you see, I am still finding it difficult to explain just what sort of book it is. Perhaps no explanation is necessary. Read in it what you like; read it to whomever you like; be of what age you like; it can only fall into one of the two classes. Either you will enjoy it, or you won't.\n\n\"It is that sort of book.\".\n\n"}

The painting is oil on silk.\n\nThe altarpiece was painted in 1631-1632 as an \"ex voto\" after the ebbing of the plague epidemic in 1630 in Bologna. The altarpiece was in the past paraded yearly in a formal procession from the Palazzo Pubblico to the church of San Domenico, Bologna.\n\nThe structure of the painting follows the formal arrangement, exemplified by a late 16th-century canvas by Annibale Carraci in the Pinacoteca of Bologna. The Madonna and child are in the superior portion. The infant blesses with his right hand, while the left hand holds a flowering sprig. Around the couple, cherubim are active draping flowers, holding rosaries and scapulars, and crowning the Virgin with a floral crown.\n\nIn the scene below, the seven saints implore for Bologna, depicted at the bottom center. Charles Borromeo, recently canonized, at the left was known for his work among the pestilent of Milan. Beside him standing is St Proculus of Bologna, a martyred Roman soldier, holding a sword and palm leaf (symbol of Martyrdom). Across the canvas, the armored St Florian holds a halberd and palm leaf. Kneeling below are: St Petronius with a bishop's mitre at his feet; St Francis in a cassock, and to the right are two Jesuit saints, Francis Xavier with the palm leaf pointing to him, and the founder of the order St Ignatius of Loyola.\n\nThe style recalls the earthy coloring of Ludovico Carracci. The work is now in the Pinacoteca of Bologna, which also has a 1616 ex voto Madonna by Reni. The \"Palla delle Peste\" is described by Viardot as \"an excellent specimen of the pale coloring which Guido had adopted\".\n"}
{"id": "102853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102853", "title": "Pazyryk burials", "text": "Pazyryk burials\n\nThe Pazyryk () burials are a number of Saka Iron Age tombs found in the Pazyryk Valley of the Ukok plateau in the Altai Mountains, Siberia, south of the modern city of Novosibirsk, Russia; the site is close to the borders with China, Kazakhstan and Mongolia.\nNumerous comparable burials have been found in neighboring western Mongolia.\n\nThe tombs are Scythian-type kurgans, barrow-like tomb mounds containing wooden chambers covered over by large cairns of boulders and stones, dated to the 4th - 3rd centuries BCE. The spectacular burials at Pazyryk are responsible for the introduction of the term \"kurgan\", a Russian word of Turkic origin, into general usage to describe these tombs. The region of the Pazyryk kurgans is considered the type site of the wider Pazyryk culture. The site is included in the Golden Mountains of Altai UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe bearers of the Pazyryk culture were horse-riding pastoral nomads of the steppe, and some may have accumulated great wealth through horse trading with merchants in Persia, India and China. This wealth is evident in the wide array of finds from the Pazyryk tombs, which include many rare examples of organic objects such as felt hangings, Chinese silk, the earliest known pile carpet, horses decked out in elaborate trappings, and wooden furniture and other household goods. These finds were preserved when water seeped into the tombs in antiquity and froze, encasing the burial goods in ice, which remained frozen in the permafrost until the time of their excavation.\n\nBecause of a freak climatic freeze, some of the Altai-Sayan burials, notably those of the 5th century BCE at Pazyryk and neighbouring sites, such as Katanda, Shibe, and Tuekt, were isolated from external climatic variations by a protective layer of ice that conserved the organic substances buried in them.\nCertain geometric designs and sun symbols, such as the circle and rosette, recur at Pazyryk but are completely outnumbered by animal motifs. Such specifically Scythian features as zoomorphic junctures, i.e. the addition of a part of one animal to the body of another, are rarer in the Altaic region than in southern Russia. The stag and its relatives, however, figure as prominently in Altai-Sayan as in Scythian art. <ref name=\"Central-Asian-arts/Visual-arts\"></ref>\n\n\"At Pazyryk too are found bearded mascarons (masks) of well-defined Greco-Roman origin, which were doubtless inspired by the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Cimmerian Bosporus.\"\n\nThe first tomb at Pazyryk, barrow 1, was excavated by the archaeologist M. P. Gryaznov in 1929; barrows 2-5 were excavated by Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko in 1947-1949. While many of the tombs had already been looted in earlier times, the excavators unearthed buried horses, and with them immaculately preserved cloth saddles, felt and woven rugs including the world's oldest pile carpet, a 3-metre-high four-wheel funeral chariot from the 5th century BC and other splendid objects that had escaped the ravages of time. These finds are now exhibited at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.\n\nCraniological studies of samples from the Pazyryk burials determined that skulls were generally of Europoid type, with some showing Mongoloid features.\n\nRudenko's most striking discovery was the body of a tattooed Pazyryk chief: a thick-set, powerfully built man who had died when he was about 50. Parts of the body had deteriorated, but much of the tattooing was still clearly visible (see ). Subsequent investigation using reflected infrared photography revealed that all five bodies discovered in the Pazyryk kurgans were tattooed. No instruments specifically designed for tattooing were found, but the Pazyryks had extremely fine needles with which they did miniature embroidery, and these were probably used for tattooing.\n\nThe chief was elaborately decorated with an interlocking series of striking designs representing a variety of fantastic beasts. The best preserved tattoos were images of a donkey, a mountain ram, two highly stylized deer with long antlers and an imaginary carnivore on the right arm. Two monsters resembling griffins decorate the chest, and on the left arm are three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a mountain goat. On the front of the right leg a fish extends from the foot to the knee. A monster crawls over the right foot, and on the inside of the shin is a series of four running rams which touch each other to form a single design. The left leg also bears tattoos, but these designs could not be clearly distinguished. In addition, the chief's back is tattooed with a series of small circles in line with the vertebral column. This tattooing was probably done for therapeutic reasons. Contemporary Siberian tribesmen still practice tattooing of this kind to relieve back pain.\n\nThe most famous undisturbed Pazyryk burial so far recovered is the Ice Maiden or \"Altai Lady\" found by archaeologist Natalia Polosmak in 1993 at Ukok, near the Chinese border. The find was a rare example of a single woman given a full ceremonial burial in a wooden chamber tomb in the fifth century BC, accompanied by six horses.\nShe had been buried over 2,400 years ago in a casket fashioned from the hollowed-out trunk of a Siberian larch tree. On the outside of the casket were stylized images of deer and snow leopards carved in leather. Shortly after burial the grave had apparently been flooded by freezing rain, and the entire contents of the burial chamber had remained frozen in permafrost. Six horses wearing elaborate harnesses had been sacrificed and lay to the north of the chamber. The maiden's well-preserved body, carefully embalmed with peat and bark, was arranged to lie on her side as if asleep. She was young, and her hair was shaven off but wearing a wig and tall hat; she had been 167 cm (5 feet 6 inches) tall. Even the animal style tattoos were preserved on her pale skin: creatures with horns that develop into flowered forms. Her coffin was made large enough to accommodate the high felt headdress she was wearing, which was decorated with swans and gold-covered carved cats. She was clad in a long crimson and white striped woolen skirt and white felt stockings. Her yellow blouse was originally thought to be made of wild \"tussah\" silk but closer examination of the fibers indicate the material is not Chinese but was a wild silk which came from somewhere else, perhaps India. Near her coffin was a vessel made of yak horn, and dishes containing gifts of coriander seeds: all of which suggest that the Pazyryk trade routes stretched across vast areas of Iran. Similar dishes in other tombs were thought to have held \"Cannabis sativa\", confirming a practice described by Herodotus but after tests the mixture was found to be coriander seeds, probably used to disguise the smell of the body.\n\nTwo years after the discovery of the \"Ice Maiden\" Dr. Polosmak's husband, Vyacheslav Molodin, found a frozen man, elaborately tattooed with an elk, with two long braids that reached to his waist, buried with his weapons.\n\nDoctor Anicua also noted that her blouse was a bit stained, indicating that the material was not a new garment, made for the burial.\n\nOne of the most famous finds at Pazyryk is the Pazyryk carpet, which is probably the oldest surviving pile carpet in the world. It measures 183×200 cm and has a knot density of approximately 360,000 knots per square meter, which is higher than most modern carpets. The middle of the carpet consists of a ribbon motif, while in the border there is a procession with elk or deer, and in another border warriors on horses. The Pazyryk carpet was manufactured in Ancient Armenia (one of hypotheses)around 400 BC. When it was found it had been deeply frozen in a block of ice, which is why it is so well-preserved. The carpet can be seen at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\n\nIn a corner of one grave chamber of the Pazyryk cemetery was a fur bag containing cannabis seed, a censer filled with stones, and the hexapod frame of an inhalation tent - these are believed to have been utilized at the end of the funerary ritual for purification.\n\nOther undisturbed kurgans have been found to contain remarkably well-preserved remains, comparable to the earlier Tarim mummies of Xinjiang. Bodies were preserved using mummification techniques and were also naturally frozen in solid ice from water seeping into the tombs. They were encased in coffins made from hollowed trunks of larch (which may have had sacral significance) and sometimes accompanied by sacrificed concubines and horses. The clustering of tombs in a single area implies that it had particular ritual significance for these people, who were likely to have been willing to transport their deceased leaders great distances for burial.\n\nAs recently as the summer of 2012, tombs have been discovered at various locations. In January 2007 a timber tomb of a blond chieftain warrior was unearthed in the permafrost of the Altai mountains region close to the Mongolian border. The body of the presumed Pazyryk chieftain is tattooed; his sable coat is well preserved, as are some other objects, including what looks like scissors. A local archaeologist, Aleksei Tishkin, complained that the indigenous population of the region strongly disapproves of archaeological digs, prompting the scientists to move their activities across the border to Mongolia.\n\nRudenko initially assigned the neutral label Pazyryk culture for these nomads and dated them to the 5th century BC; the dating has been revised for barrows 1-5 at Pazyryk, which are now considered to date to the 4th-3rd centuries B.C. The Pazyryk culture has since been connected to the Scythians whose similar tombs have been found across the steppes. The Siberian animal style tattooing is characteristic of the Scythians. Trading routes between Central Asia, China and the Near East passed through the oases on the plateau and these ancient Altai nomads profited from the rich trade and culture passing through. There is evidence that Pazyryk trade routes were vast and connected with large areas of Asia including India, perhaps Pazyryk merchants largely trading in high quality horses.\n\nThere is also the possibility that the current inhabitants of the Altai region are descendants of the Pazyryk culture, a continuity that would accord with current ethnic politics: Archaeogenetics is now being used to study the Pazyryk mummies.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20140100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20140100", "title": "Representation of women in Athenian tragedy", "text": "Representation of women in Athenian tragedy\n\nThe representation of women in Athenian tragedy was performed exclusively by men and it is likely (although the evidence is not conclusive) that it was performed solely for men as well.\n\nIn a society that valued women’s silence, their predominance in the most public of Athenian art-forms constitutes a paradox. Only one of the surviving 32 plays has no female characters: Sophocles' \"Philoctetes\". Female tragic choruses also outnumber the male choruses by twenty-one to ten.\n\nMacaria, in the \"Heracleidae\" states that \"for a woman, silence and self control are best.\" The philosopher Xenophon thought females possessed the positive traits of 'vigilance' and 'love for infants'. However Xenophon reflects the Greek fear of these 'others', highlighting their irrationality, religious fervour and sexual passion. Aristotle went further, stating that women were deformed, incomplete males, designed to be subservient to men.\n\nAs a result, women had their freedom restricted and were believed to have lived in separate areas to men. In a speech recorded in the Lysias Orations 3.6, a speaker seeks to convey his opponent’s licentiousness by telling how he trespassed into \"the women’s rooms where my sister and my nieces were – women who have always lived so decently that they are ashamed to be seen even by relatives.\" Sheila Murnaghan argues that \"it is no accident that what little evidence we do have for actual Athenian women comes largely from courtroom speeches or medical treatises, genres brought into being by conflict and disease.\"\n\nIn Ancient Greece, a woman was viewed as a passive conduit of male fertility, on long term loan by her father. Marriage was an unequal relationship, whereby the husband owned the children and didn’t have the same obligation toward sexual fidelity that the wife had. \nThe playwright Euripides presents two very different reactions to this cultural norm. Firstly, his female protagonist Alcestis, represents the \"perfect wife\" sacrificing her own life, so her husband, Admetos, can live. Yet as Blondell points out this \"female fame is hard won, even oxymoronic\" as her own marriage kills her.\n\nThe most important relationships within this play are between the men. Heracles goes to the underworld not for Alcestis, but to honour his male friend’s hospitality. Admetos goes against the promise he made to his wife, so as to obey his male friendship. \"Alcestis drops out,\" Easterling argues, \"to facilitate the interaction between the men.\"\n\nIn contrast, however, Euripides Medea breaks the marital conventions, choosing her husband herself and reacting against his infidelity by breaking the female oath and killing her children. \"In a sense,\" Blondell argues, \"every bride was a stranger in a strange land. And every married woman was dependent on her husband.\"\n\nIn the surviving plays, women become tragic figures by men’s absence or mismanagement.\n\nSophocles' Antigone takes action after her uncle Creon refuses to bury her brother Polynices. In Aeschylus' \"Oresteia\", Clytemnestra takes power in Argos because her husband Agamemnon has been away fighting at Troy for ten years. Clytemnestra's later murder of him is motivated by a range of male abuses. Medea becomes the aggressor when her husband Jason plans a new more advantageous marriage.\n\nThere is also a theme running through the plays based on the setting. Performed in open-air theatres, Classical Athenian tragedy was set outside the private sphere of the home. Indeed, Euripides was notorious for \"taking the streets, the bedroom, into tragedy\" and thereby reducing its remoteness.\n\nIn \"Hippolytus\", Phaedra first appears, carried out of the house by her servants, demanding open air, in order to declare her love for her stepson and thus the spiral of tragedy to unwind. In Aeschylus' \"Oresteia\", Clytemnestra in the first play of the trilogy orders her husband's death outside, while in the second play, her son Orestes forces her into the house to be killed. It is only in the third play, which is in an entirely public space of the court of Areopagus, that order is restored. \"This three play sequence,\" Bushnell argues, \"which begins when a self-willed woman takes matters into her own hands, finally achieves closure as figures representing women are removed from view.'\n\nA woman displaying traits of the heroic Grecian male was not portrayed in a positive light. Euripides' Medea is the prime example. Her name in Greek means \"cunning\" and is also the word for the Persians (the Greek’s greatest foreign enemy).\n\nMost of the time, a woman is full of fear<br>\nToo weak to defend herself or to bear the sight of steel <br>\nBut if she happens to be wronged in love,<br>\nHers is the bloodthirstiest heart of all.\n\nRuby Blondell argues that Medea displays stereotypically male attributes that the Greeks held as positive. Possessing courage, intelligence, decisiveness, resourcefulness, power, independence, the ability to conceive and carry out a plan effectively, as well as the art of rhetoric. The nurse even likens her to a rock of the sea, as Patroclus famously does to Homer’s Achilles in the epic poem \"The Iliad\". Yet Medea, similarly to Aeschylus’ Clytemnestra, another \"woman with a heart of manly counsel\" were not admired but portrayed as \"Cruella de Vil\" type characters.\n\nSo the declaration \"that a noble man ought either to live with honour, or die with honour\" does not apply to women.\n\nIn Plato’s Republic, Socrates thought the impersonation of inferiors, such as women and slaves, that drama utilised was morally harmful. Socrates was also worried \"about the ethical damage caused by the representation of 'womanish' emotions in tragedy.\" Plato unsurprisingly excludes poetry, embodied by the figure of a woman, from his ideal city-state.\n\nThe Athenians however thought it important to place on \"display those feature[s] of human experience that inspire terror, sorrow and rejection, and they accomplished their mission by giving women visibility and a powerful voice.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "34611084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34611084", "title": "Save the World (George Harrison song)", "text": "Save the World (George Harrison song)\n\n\"Save the World\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released as the final track of his 1981 album \"Somewhere in England\". It was also the B-side of \"Teardrops\", which was the second single off the album. An environmental protest song, \"Save the World\" was Harrison's first composition to directly address topical issues such as the nuclear arms race, rainforest and wildlife devastation, and the ecologically irresponsible practices of corporate concerns. Musically, the song partly recalls the style of the comedy troupe Monty Python.\n\nHarrison recorded \"Save the World\" at his Friar Park studio in England in 1980. The recording includes sound effects that support the song's message of a world heading towards self-destruction, including bombs falling, a cash register, a street demonstration, and a nuclear explosion. In 1985, Harrison contributed a version of the song with amended lyrics to Greenpeace's self-titled fundraising album. \"Save the World\" also appeared on the home video \"Greenpeace: Non-Toxic Video Hits\".\n\nSince its release, the song has been held in low regard by several music critics and biographers. Some of these reviewers highlight the disparity between the serious message and the quirky musical backing. In line with Harrison's wishes, a demo of \"Save the World\" appeared as the sole bonus track on the posthumously reissued \"Somewhere in England\" in 2004.\n\nAs reproduced in the 2017 book \"I, Me, Mine – The Extended Edition\", George Harrison dated the lyrics of \"Save the World\" to 24 February 1978, with Hana, Maui as the location. During that visit to Hawaii, Harrison completed the writing for his 1979 album \"George Harrison\", which, as with its predecessor, \"Thirty Three & 1/3\", reflected a light-heartedness that had been lacking in much of his work. He returned to the song when working on his album \"Somewhere in England\", most of which was written between mid 1979 and the early part of 1980. As with a track Harrison wrote for \"Somewhere in England\", \"Tears of the World\", \"Save the World\" conveys his disapproval at the ecological issues and political machinations threatening the world in the early 1980s.\n\nDuring 1980, Harrison became a member of Greenpeace and CND; he also protested against the use of nuclear energy with Friends of the Earth, in London, and helped finance \"Vole\", a green magazine launched by Monty Python member Terry Jones. Author Simon Leng describes \"Save the World\" as Harrison's first attempt at ecology-focused songwriting and a \"quirky protest song\" that marked \"the culmination of the Pythonization of Harrison's music\" at a time when he was increasingly associated with members of the Monty Python comedy troupe through his film company HandMade Films. While recognising \"Save the World\" as indicative of its composer's disillusion with the 1980s, Leng comments that Harrison had long valued the \"madness\" of Monty Python's comedy as \"a mirror to the insanity of world events\", and that his adoption of humour was a \"peculiarly British\" reaction to a grave situation.\n\nIn his lyrics, Harrison sings of \"This planet's rape, how we've abused it\". He first addresses the nuclear arms race being waged between the United States and the Soviet Union, and laments the introduction of intergalactic weapons. He then addresses the devastation of the world's rainforests for commercial gain and the threat to wildlife. He refers to the Save the Whales environmental campaign and how Greenpeace's attempts to limit whale hunting had been thwarted by the interests of \"dog food salesmen\". He also laments the irresponsibility of arms manufacturers and, with regard to plutonium stockpiles, concludes: \"Now you can make your own H-bomb / Right in the kitchen with your mom.\" He then denigrates the use of nuclear power as a \"half-wit's answer to a need\" that causes cancer. In the final verse, Harrison attributes the world's environmental problems to just a few profit-seeking individuals. He ends on what he promises to be \"a happy note\" by stating that a simple solution lies in the realisation that \"God [lives] in your heart\".\n\nIn a 1987 interview, Harrison said that \"Save the World\" was meant to be \"serious and funny at the same time\". Contrasting with the subject matter, the music recalls the comedy songs of Monty Python. In the description of Harrison biographer Alan Clayson, the style is \"quasi-reggae\", while author Ian Inglis refers to it being sung on the official recording \"in a deceptively sweet voice to a march tempo\". Leng also likens the song's musical aspects to Harrison's 1975 tribute to comedian Legs Larry Smith, \"His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)\", in terms of its groove and musical arrangement.\n\nHarrison recorded \"Save the World\" during the main sessions for \"Somewhere in England\", held at his FPSHOT studio in Henley, Oxfordshire, between March and September 1980. Aside from Harrison, who played guitars and self-produced the sessions, the musicians on the track were Neil Larsen and Gary Brooker (both on keyboards), Willie Weeks (bass), Jim Keltner (drums), Ray Cooper (percussion) and Tom Scott (horns). Harrison added various sound effects throughout the recording, including the sound of bombs being dropped, a cash register, an army on the march, gunfire, and a street demonstration. The majority of these effects appear midway through the song, accompanied by a Moog synthesizer solo, after which the section concludes with the sound of a nuclear explosion. A baby's cry then accompanies the song's return.\n\nAt the end of the track, Harrison edited in the faint sound of a bow-played Indian string instrument, the tar shehnai. This part was taken from \"Crying\", an instrumental piece performed by Vinayak Vora and released on Harrison's 1968 soundtrack album \"Wonderwall Music\". When asked about its inclusion in \"Save the World\", Harrison told \"Musician\" magazine in 1987: \"I just wanted to let the whole song go out with something sad, to touch that nerve and maybe make you think, 'Ohhh shit.'\"\n\nAfter submitting \"Somewhere in England\" to Warner Bros. Records, the distributor of his Dark Horse record label, in late September 1980, Harrison was forced to rework the content of the album – including replacing four of the original songs – to ensure the release had more commercial appeal. Harrison chose to retain \"Save the World\" in the revised track listing and worked with Ray Cooper on a second version of the album. Although the mix for the re-submitted \"Save the World\" differed little from Harrison's original, Cooper was credited as a co-producer.\n\n\"Somewhere in England\" was released on 1 June 1981, with \"Save the World\" sequenced as the final track. It was the only song from Harrison's initial submission to Warner Bros. to retain its position in the running order of the official release. The album was a relative commercial success, an outcome that was due largely to a public outpouring of grief in reaction to the murder of Harrison's former Beatles bandmate John Lennon in December 1980. As a follow-up single to Harrison's tribute to Lennon, \"All Those Years Ago\", Warner's released \"Teardrops\", which was another of the album's four replacement tracks. This release took place on 20 July 1981, with \"Save the World\" appearing as the single's B-side.\n\nIn his album review for \"Creem\" magazine, Mitchell Cohen called Harrison a \"C– thinker\" and ridiculed the lyrics of \"Save the World\" with the comment: \"Harrison comes out against \"paper towels\" (!!) (expect a rebuttal on the next Nancy Walker album) and whalemeat used as dogfood (ditto Lorne Greene).\" In another unfavourable review, Harry Thomas of \"Rolling Stone\" opined that \"Social commentary and ironic wit clearly remain outside the scope of Harrison's very real talents\" and wrote of \"Save the World\": \"Veering uncertainly between whimsy and dour warnings, the song ultimately fails either to galvanize or amuse.\" Conversely, \"NME\" critic Bob Woffinden welcomed the song as an example of how the album's subject matter ranged beyond the \"humdrum\", and he found it \"only characteristic of [Harrison] to embrace more universal themes\".\n\nHarrison revisited \"Save the World\" in 1985 when Greenpeace UK approached him for a contribution to an album intended to raise funds for their environmental efforts. Harrison amended the lyrics slightly to include further references to Greenpeace, along with a spoken comment that conveyed his disgust with the power of corporations: \"You greedy bastards\". In addition to recording a new vocal, he remixed the musical backing, giving more prominence to some of the guitar parts.\nTitled \"Greenpeace – The Album\", and including contributions from fifteen other British artists, the album was released in the UK by EMI on 4 June 1985. The inclusion of \"Save the World\" on \"Greenpeace\" marked a rare new musical release for Harrison between 1983 and 1986, when he was otherwise engaged in film production with the continued success of HandMade. Over the same period, however, he became increasingly involved in environmental matters; these activities included attending an anti-nuclear demonstration in London's Trafalgar Square, voicing support for the British Green Party, and inspiring a successful campaign to stop the John Lewis Partnership from demolishing Henley's Regal Cinema and building a supermarket complex.\n\nThe song was also included in the video compilation \"Greenpeace: Non-Toxic Video Hits\", released in December 1985, five months after the French intelligence services' sinking of the Greenpeace flagship \"Rainbow Warrior\". Produced by Ian Weiner, the clip for \"Save the World\" consisted of scenes of \"Rainbow Warrior\" and Greenpeace personnel at work on their international activist campaigns.\n\nUntil his death in November 2001, Harrison continued to express alarm at the ecological issues facing the world. He dedicated his 1989 compilation album \"Best of Dark Horse\" to Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and \"anyone interested in saving our planet\"; in the revised artwork for the 2001 reissue of \"All Things Must Pass\", he included a series of images showing the gradual encroachment of pollution and industry onto the Friar Park scene depicted on that album's 1970 cover photo. As a songwriter, he revisited the themes of \"Save the World\" in \"Cockamamie Business\", a new song issued on \"Best of Dark Horse\", and in the title track to his final studio album, the posthumously released \"Brainwashed\".\n\nIn the 1990s, Harrison's elder sister, Louise, used \"Save the World\" as the soundtrack for a series of public service radio segments she produced, titled \"Good Earthkeeping Tips\", which offered information on environmental issues. In keeping with Harrison's instructions for the reissuing of his Dark Horse catalogue, a demo of the song appeared as the sole bonus track on the 2004 reissue of \"Somewhere in England\".<ref name=\"John Metzger/MB\">John Metzger, \"George Harrison \"The Dark Horse Years\" (Part Three: \"Somewhere in England\")\", \"The Music Box\", vol. 11 (5), May 2004 (retrieved 20 November 2016).</ref> Writing for \"Uncut\" in March 2017, Neil Spencer highlighted \"Save the World\" as one of the \"[unexpected] delights\" among Harrison's 1980s releases, and said that while it was dismissed as \"soft protest\" originally, the song is \"beautifully played and never more relevant than today\".<ref name=\"Spencer/Uncut\">Neil Spencer, \"George Harrison – The Vinyl Collection\", uncut.co.uk, 27 March 2017 (retrieved 30 November 2017).</ref>\n\n\"Save the World\" is held in low regard by several Harrison and Beatles biographers. Chip Madinger and Mark Easter describe it as \"a wholly unappealing track\" on which the \"heavyhandedness\" of the lyrics is completely at odds with the musical mood. Ian Inglis echoes this view, deeming the lyrics \"trite to the point of being risible\" and the combination of an unfocused narrative and the overuse of sound effects to be as unsuccessful as the Beatles' work during the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" era. Although he concedes that the scarcity of environmental songs in the early 1980s, relative to the 1990s, might be a mitigating factor, Inglis dismisses the song as a \"hopelessly vague indictment of the perils we are inflicting around the globe\", adding: \"The problem with such a general attack is that it lacks focus and, therefore, force.\"\n\nAlan Clayson views Harrison's conservationist sentiments as \"laudable\" and considers the track to be a protest song in the mould of Barry McGuire's 1965 hit \"Eve of Destruction\", yet he also identifies the lack of subtlety as betraying \"the impartiality of one long and, perhaps, guiltily isolated from the everyday\". Dale Allison recognises it as \"the most extensive expression of George's ecological anxiety\" and a sincere statement, particularly as Harrison chose to revisit the track for the Greenpeace album. However, Allison deems it to be a \"strange song\" with a \"jarring disjunction between lyric and sound\", and he says that as with Harrison's other songs about pollution and environmental issues, his message reflects a romanticism that was born out of 1960s radicalism but fails to convince in the manner of Neil Young's \"After the Gold Rush\". Simon Leng finds \"Save the World\" closer in style to Monty Python's \"Eric the Half-a-Bee\" than to a genuine environmental song such as \"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\" by Marvin Gaye. He describes the \"Somewhere in England\" version as \"horribly overproduced\" next to the \"charming\" demo, which \"is more Dylan than Monty Python\".\n\nAccording to Simon Leng:\n\n\n"}

During a career in operetta and other forms of musical theatre, she managed several of her own opera companies and raised four children as a single mother. She is best remembered as a producer of the original production of \"Trial by Jury\" by Gilbert and Sullivan.\n\nDolaro was born in London. Her father was the violinist and conductor Benjamin Simmonds, and her mother was Julia (née Lewis). Dolaro received early music lessons from her father's colleagues, and she attended the Paris Conservatory as a teenager to continue her musical studies. In 1865, at the age of sixteen, she married Isaac Dolaro Belasco, an Italian Jew of Spanish descent, in Upper Kennington, England. By 1870, she had adopted Dolaro as her stage name.\nDolaro made her stage debut at the Lyceum Theatre, in the role of the Spanish princess, Galsuinda, in Hervé's operetta \"Chilpéric\" in 1870 and soon played there in Offenbach operettas. Successes at various London theatres followed: After a season at the Gaiety Theatre, London, Dolaro starred in an English-language Offenbach adaptation called \"Breaking the Spell\", on tour with Fred Sullivan's Operetta Company in 1871. In 1872 Dolaro was a leading performer in H. B. Farnie's English-language adaptation of Offenbach's \"Geneviève de Brabant\", in Hervé's \"Doctor Faust\" and in a burlesque of Ferdinand Hérold's \"Zampa\" (\"Charmingly sung by Miss Dolaro in imitation of Mdlle Chaumont\", said \"The Times\") She also appeared in the title role of Bizet's \"Carmen\" in the first English-language production, with the Carl Rosa Opera Company, opposite Durward Lely as Don José. In 1873, Dolaro divorced her husband on the grounds of his adultery and desertion; she brought up her two sons and two daughters on her own income.\n\nBy January 1875, Dolaro was director of the Royalty Theatre, where her father served as musical director. She starred as the title character in Offenbach's \"La Périchole\", uniting \"vivacity as an actress\" with \"taste and skill as a singer\". As a replacement afterpiece to \"La Périchole\", her new theatre manager, Richard D'Oyly Carte, commissioned \"Trial by Jury\" from W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan conducted the opening night performance of \"Trial\" on 25 March, but Dolaro's father generally conducted the orchestra thereafter until the end of its initial run on 12 June 1875.\n\nDolaro took her Madame Selina Dolaro's Comic Opera Co. on tour between 13 June and 10 October 1875, as the theatre was closed during the hot summer months. On their return, Charles Morton became manager of the theatre. Dolaro returned to the position in January 1876 when, again working with Carte, she played Malvina in \"The Duke's Daughter\". Dolaro continued to perform both in London and on tour, appearing at the Alhambra Theatre in 1877. In 1879 she worked at the Folly Theatre, which she also managed for the time.\n\nDolaro travelled to the United States that autumn, appearing in October at the Academy of Music in New York City in the title role of \"Carmen\", but reviews were mixed, with one critic commenting that she seemed \"much more at home\" performing in burlesque and comic opera. She then joined a touring comic opera troupe before returning to London. In 1880 she appeared again at the Globe Theatre as Cerisette in Farnie & Genee's \"The Naval Cadets\". Soon thereafter she moved to New York, where she spent the next few seasons performing in comic opera. There, she worked under Carte's agency while appearing as Girola in Bucalossi's \"Les Manteaux Noirs\" and Katrina in Robert Planquette's \"Rip van Winkle\" and as the Fairy Queen in Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Iolanthe\", both in 1882 at the Standard Theatre. In 1883, an opinion piece in the \"New York Herald\" by a Reverend Philip Germond denounced \"play-acting as a godless life.\" Dolaro responded with a spirited defence of her profession: \"Had I not been ‘launched’ on this ‘godless life,’ I should probably have been a burden to some parish or perhaps launched on what I regard as indeed a godless life. ... Is it not enough that we must slave as we do to earn the means to educate and train our children so as to enable them to become useful members of society without being assailed even from the pulpit with such outrageous slander?”\n\nDolaro's last part was Minnie Marden in an adaptation of Victorien Sardou's \"Agnes\" in 1886. Her health soon began to decline, as she began to struggle with tuberculosis. Her last appearance was in New York as a supernumerary in a benefit production of \"Hamlet\" for Lester Wallack, played at Daly's Theatre in May 1888.\n\nDolaro died of a stroke in New York City in January 1889 at the age of 39.\n\nDolaro's play, \"In the Fashion\" (later known only as \"Fashion\"), ran in New York between 1887 and 1888. Her \"Mes amours: Poems, Passionate and Playful\", based on love letters that she had received, was published in 1888. She also wrote a play called \"Justine\".\n\nDolaro also wrote novels, including: \n\n\n"}

{"id": "19796039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19796039", "title": "Taos Society of Artists", "text": "Taos Society of Artists\n\nThe Taos Society of Artists was an organization of visual arts founded in Taos, New Mexico in 1915; it disbanded in 1927. The Society was essentially a commercial cooperative, as opposed to a stylistic collective, and its foundation contributed to the development of the tiny Taos art colony into an international art center.\n\nJoseph Henry Sharp, who decided to make painting of Native Americans his life work, visited Taos on a trip through New Mexico in 1893. While there he became enchanted with the people of the Taos Pueblo and the landscape, an interest he shared with Ernest Blumenschein when they were studying art in Paris. Having heard of the degree to which Sharp was interested in painting the western United States, and the Indian pueblo of Taos in particular, Blumenschein came to Taos with fellow artist Bert Phillips in 1898. Planning only to visit Taos, they became enamored by the Taos valley and its people that they decided to stay. This was the beginning of the Taos art colony.\n\nBlumenschein described his first sights of Taos, \"The month was September, and the fertile valley a beautiful sight, and inspiration for those who ply the brush for happiness. The primitive people of this out-of-the-way region were harvesting their crops by sunlight and by moonlight. Brown people they were, both Mexicans and Indians, happy people with happy children, in a garden spot protected by mountains.\" More compelling were the people. Native Americans had lived for centuries in the pueblo just outside the village of Taos. There a peace-loving, democratic society has maintained, and continues to maintain, its history, culture, dress and way of life over centuries.\n\nErnest Blumenschein returned to New York City for a time while Phillips stayed behind. Blumenschein kept up correspondence with Phillips and discussed setting up an artist colony in Taos. Blumenschein also wrote other artists in New York and Paris of Taos about the \"beauty and artistic promise of northern New Mexico.\"\n\nOn July 19, 1915 Joseph Henry Sharp, E. Irving Couse, Oscar E. Berninghaus, W. Herbert Dunton, Ernest Blumenschein and Bert Phillips formed the Taos Society of Artists. The six founding members were known as the \"Taos Six\". E. Irving Couse was the Society's first president.\n\nTheir work, defined the first several decades of the Taos art colony, was distinguished by: Native Americans in traditional clothing, area Hispanics and Anglo-Americans and landscapes.\n\nThe group's first exhibition was held at the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe soon after their formation. By 1917 they were sending travelling exhibits of their work across the United States. Initial critical reaction of the works was that they were unrealistic and overdone: vivid colors, too emotionally evocative and strong vibrational quality. The artists questioned the critics veracity, since they had never been to the southwestern desert, nor the Taos Pueblo.\n\nMember artists had to have worked in Taos for three consecutive years, shown an interest and aptitude for painting Native Americans and have shown in reputable galleries or New York salons (ongoing art exhibits). The primary reason for the requirements was to ensure that the artists were well-intentioned and capable of capturing the character and spirit of the people.\n\nLater members included Julius Rolshoven, E. Martin Hennings, Catharine C. Critcher (the only female member ), Kenneth Adams, Walter Ufer, and Victor Higgins.\n\nSome artists from Santa Fe, another developing arts center, were included as Associate members: Robert Henri, Albert L. Groll, Randall Davey, B.J.O. Nordfeldt, Gustave Baumann, Albert Groll, Birger Sandzén, and John Sloan.\nHonorary memberships were extended to men who helped create a museum infrastructure in New Mexico: Edgar L. Hewett, the director of the Museum of New Mexico; and Frank Springer, whose donations helped to build the Museum of New Mexico’s Fine Arts Museum in Santa Fe.\n\nDuring World War I, the Taos society artists served on United War Work Committees, designed posters and exhibited canvases at Red Cross bazars. Most notably they created \"range-finder paintings\", 50 by 100 foot landscapes of Belgium and France used as military teaching tools. Several of these paintings were exhibited in the 1918 Taos Society of Artists' annual exhibition held at the Museum of New Mexico\n\nThe depression was the precipitating factor for the dissolution of the Taos Society of Artists. Taos was devastated by the depression and the artist's patrons were not spending money on art during that time. Victor Higgins the most financially devastated by the Depression made two of his most important paintings during that time, \"Winter Funeral\" heralded by the New York press, and \"Sleeping Nude\" similarly praised by the Chicago Herald Examiner writer Inez Cunningham. Cunningham likened Higgins to a phoenix rising out of the ashes, \"what heights of intellectual and emotional fire. He is one of those fortunate few who flower in maturity.\"\n\nThe \"Taos Six\" applied academic technique to native themes to produce a uniquely American school of painting. Each artist's style was unique, though cross influence can certainly be noted as can strong elements of their European Academic artistic training. Aside from the inspiration of their environment, one quality early Taos art colony paintings share is their vibrant palette of colors - not a common sight when paired with more traditional representational images and application of paint. Today, these artists are recognized for their contribution to artistic development and their scenes of Taos locales grace the walls of many museums.\n\n\n\n"}

Cutler and produced by Eliza Hindmarch and Sadia Shepard.\n\nIt was released in Australia on August 20, 2009 after being screened at numerous film festivals including Sundance, Zurich, Silverdocs and Sheffield Doc/Fest. The movie was released in American theaters on August 28, 2009.\n\nThe film revolves around the making of the \"Vogue\" September 2007 issue. (The September \"Vogue\" is traditionally the biggest, most important issue of the year.) It depicts the effort that goes into making the magazine, and the passion that Grace Coddington, a former model turned creative director and the only person who dares to stand up to Anna Wintour, has for the highly regarded fashion magazine. In the film, Coddington is often portrayed as the leading victim to Wintour's aggressive personality. The relationship between Wintour and Coddington reveals itself to be symbiotic, as Wintour recognizes Coddington's expertise and keen eye for design. In the end, Wintour approves most of Coddington's ideas and they appear in the final version of the September issue.\n\nThe film features appearances by many well-known and influential people in the fashion industry, from top editorial models to noted fashion photographers and designers.\n\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 83% based on reviews from 109 critics, with the site's consensus: \"This doc about the making of \"Vogue\"s biggest issue and its frosty editor-in-chief is fascinating eye candy and light-on-its-feet fun.\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 69/100 based on reviews from 33 critics.\n\nDue to the popularity of the film, the September 2007 issue of \"Vogue\" that was documented in the film has peaked to prices between $80 and $115 on eBay, making it one of the most sought after issues ever. Although the 840-page issue is massive, it is not the biggest \"Vogue\" issue ever, as the September 2012 issue beats it by 96 pages, (916).\n\n"}
{"id": "41316252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41316252", "title": "Theatre in Yemen", "text": "Theatre in Yemen\n\nTheater has been performed in Yemen since the early years of the twentieth century. It is, as elsewhere, a public and social genre: performances take place in cultural centers, at universities, at schools and language institutes, in public parks and squares, as well as at more intimate gatherings, such as wedding celebrations. By the count of one scholar of Yemeni theater, a minimum of five hundred plays of all kinds have been performed in Yemen over the course of the last century, around three hundred and seventy of which are by Yemeni authors; there are also around one hundred published Yemeni play scripts.\nSome of these plays have taken uniquely Yemeni themes as their subject matter: particular moments or celebrated figures from Yemeni history, like Bilqis, the legendary Queen of Sheba; the 1962 revolution against the Hamid al-Din Imamate in the North; or the 1967 revolution against the British colonial forces in the South. But Yemeni performances have also drawn upon other traditions, including Egyptian drama, like the works of Yusuf Idris, Alfred Farag, and Tawfiq al-Hakim, and on texts by European playwrights such as William Shakespeare, Jean Racine, Bertolt Brecht, and Luigi Pirandello. Performances vary in type from tragedy to improvised comedy, from musical to experimental theater, from naturalistic plays to theater of the absurd.\n\nAccording to Yemeni theater historian Sa'id Aulaqi, the first play publicly performed by Yemeni actors was Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\", in Arabic translation, staged in the city of Aden in 1910. Shakespeare proved popular with Yemeni audiences: subsequent decades saw performances of \"Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet\", \"The Merchant of Venice\", and \"Othello\". \nBut Yemeni playwrights and actors also created their own texts. Some of these plays sought to criticize the British occupying forces in Aden and the surrounding area, and to call for independence. Others were less overtly political—romantic comedies, or dramatizations of foundational events in Islamic history. The first full-length comedy performed in Yemeni dialect, Masrur Mabruk’s \"Tarfisha and Shorban\", took place in 1941.\nPerformances in the early decades of the 20th century often took place in public squares or in schools, since no theaters \"per se\" existed. Only men acted, as in the Elizabethan era, and some became famous for interpreting female characters. This remained the case until 1956, when Nabiha Azim became the first Yemeni woman to appear on stage. It is also important to note that, in the first half of the 20th century, almost all performances occurred in the south of Yemen, most notably in Aden. In the North, under the Imamate, theatrical performances were much rarer. \n\nThe 1960s were a decade of revolution both North and South, and many Yemeni performances from these years took revolution as their theme, reflecting upon the military and political upheavals and the challenges of building new states and societies. The governments of the Yemen Arab Republic and the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen (North and South Yemen respectively) demonstrated their interest in theater by establishing National Theater Troupes and supporting theater festivals. \nYemeni theater faced new challenges in the 1980s as a result of economic crises and political upheaval (war in 1979 between North and South Yemen, a civil war in the South in 1986). The celebrations that greeted the unification of North and South as the Republic of Yemen in 1990 were short-lived. Civil war broke out in 1994, amidst a background of economic hardship resulting from the expulsion of Yemeni workers from Saudi Arabia in the wake of the first Gulf War. Performances continued, however, both independently and under the auspices of the government, which sponsored important theater festivals in the 1990s that showcased the work of theater troupes from each of Yemen’s provinces.\n\nThe 21st century has seen a resurgence of theater in Yemen, with foreign embassies, INGOs, and local organizations and institutes sponsoring theatrical productions. Among Yemen’s most notable contemporary actors and directors are ‘Amr Jamal and the Khalij Aden acting troupe, Amin Hazaber, Nargis ‘Abbad, Nabil Hizam, Ibrahim al-‘Ashmuri, and Saleh al-Saleh. The \"Global Shakespeares\" webpage, hosted by MIT, recently added its first-ever page featuring a Yemeni production, a scene from \"Aismur Ma'ish al-Siraj,\" directed by Hazaber (2012, 2013).\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"trailer\" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a feature film screening. That practice did not last long, because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film begins.\n\nMovie trailers have now become popular on DVDs and Blu-ray discs, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Of some 10 billion videos watched online annually, film trailers rank third, after news and user-created video. The trailer format has also been adopted as a promotional tool for television shows, video games, books, and theatrical events/concerts.\n\nThe first trailer shown in an American film theater was in November 1913, when Nils Granlund, the advertising manager for the Marcus Loew theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical \"The Pleasure Seekers\", opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. As reported in a wire service story carried by the Lincoln, Nebraska \"Daily Star\", the practice which Loew adopted was described as \"an entirely new and unique stunt\", and that \"moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loew’s picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising\". Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring Charlie Chaplin at Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914.\n\nTrailers were initially shown after, or \"trailing\", the feature film, and this led to their being called \"trailers\". The practice was found to be somewhat ineffective, often ignored by audiences who left immediately after the feature. Later, exhibitors changed their practice so that trailers were only one part of the film program, which included cartoon shorts, newsreels, and serial adventure episodes. Today, more elaborate trailers and commercial advertisements have largely replaced other forms of pre-feature entertainment, and in major multiplex chains, about the first 20 minutes after the posted showtime is devoted to trailers.\n\nUp until the late 1950s, trailers were mostly created by National Screen Service and consisted of various key scenes from the film being advertised, often augmented with large, descriptive text describing the story, and an underscore generally pulled from studio music libraries. Most trailers had some form of narration, and those that did featured stentorian voices.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the face of motion picture trailers changed. Textless, montage trailers and quick-editing became popular, largely due to the arrival of the \"new Hollywood\" and techniques that were becoming increasingly popular in television. Among the trend setters were Stanley Kubrick with his montage trailers for \"Lolita\" (1962), \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\" (1964), and \"\" (1968). Kubrick's main inspiration for the \"Dr. Strangelove\" trailer was the short film \"Very Nice, Very Nice\" (1961) by Canadian film visionary Arthur Lipsett. Pablo Ferro, who pioneered the techniques Kubrick required as necessary elements for the success of his campaign, created the \"Dr. Strangelove\" trailer, as well as the award-winning trailer for \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971).\n\nMany home videos contain trailers for other movies produced by the same company scheduled to be available shortly after the legal release of the video, so as not to spend money advertising the videos on TV. Most VHS tapes would play them at the beginning of the tape, but some VHS tapes contained previews at the end of the film or at both ends of the tape. VHS tapes that contained trailers at the end usually reminded the viewer to \"Stay tuned after the feature for more previews.\" With DVDs and Blu-rays, trailers can operate as a bonus feature instead of having to watch through the trailers before the film.\n\nTrailers consist of a series selected shots from the film being advertised. Since the purpose of the trailer is to attract an audience to the film, these excerpts are usually drawn from the most exciting, funny, or otherwise noteworthy parts of the film but in abbreviated form and usually without producing spoilers. For this purpose the scenes are not necessarily in the order in which they appear in the film. A trailer has to achieve that in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the maximum length allowed by the MPAA. Each studio or distributor is allowed to exceed this time limit once a year, if they feel it is necessary for a particular film.\n\nIn January 2014, the movie theater trade group \"National Association of Theatre Owners\" issued an industry guideline asking that film distributors supply trailers that run no longer than 2 minutes, which is 30 second shorter than the prior norm. The guideline is not mandatory, and also allows for limited exceptions of a select few movies having longer trailers. Film distributors reacted coolly to the announcement. There had been no visible disputes on trailer running time prior to the guideline, which surprised many.\n\nSome trailers use \"special shoot\" footage, which is material that has been created specifically for advertising purposes and does not appear in the actual film. The most notable film to use this technique was \"\", whose trailer featured an elaborate special effect scene of a T-800 Terminator being assembled in a factory that was never intended to be in the film itself. Dimension Films also shot extra scenes for their 2006 horror remake, \"Black Christmas\" - these scenes were used in promotional footage for the film, but are similarly absent from the theatrical release. A trailer for the 2002 blockbuster \"Spider-Man\" had an entire action sequence especially constructed that involved escaping bank robbers in a helicopter getting caught in a giant web between the World Trade Center's two towers. However, after the September 11 attacks the studio pulled it from theaters.\n\nOne of the most famous \"special shoot\" trailers is that used for the 1960s thriller \"Psycho\", which featured director Alfred Hitchcock giving viewers a guided tour of the Bates Motel, eventually arriving at the infamous shower. At this point, the soft-spoken Hitchcock suddenly throws the shower curtain back to reveal Vera Miles with a blood-curdling scream. As the trailer, in fact, was made after completion of the film when Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Miles don a blonde wig for the fleeting sequence. Since the title, \"Psycho\", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years until freeze-frame analysis clearly revealed that it was Vera Miles and not Janet Leigh in the shower during the trailer.\n\nThere are dozens of companies that specialize in the creation of film trailers in Los Angeles and New York. The trailer may be created at agencies (such as The Cimarron Group, MOJO, The Ant Farm, Ben Cain, Aspect Ratio, Flyer Entertainment, Trailer Park, Buddha Jones) while the film itself is being cut together at the studio. Since the edited film does not exist at this point, the trailer editors work from rushes or dailies. Thus, the trailer may contain footage that is not in the final movie, or the trailer editor and the film editor may use different takes of a particular shot. Another common technique is including music on the trailer which does not appear on the movie's soundtrack. This is nearly always a requirement, as trailers and teasers are created long before the composer has even been hired for the film score—sometimes as much as a year ahead of the movie's release date—while composers are usually the last creative people to work on the film.\n\nSome trailers that incorporate material not in the film are particularly coveted by collectors, especially trailers for classic films. For example, in a trailer for \"Casablanca\" the character Rick Blaine says, \"OK, you asked for it!\" before shooting Major Strasser; this line of dialogue is not spoken in the final film.\n\nOver the years, there have been many instances where trailers give misleading representations of their films. They may give the impression that a celebrity who only has a minor part in the film is one of the main cast members, or advertising a film as being more action-packed than it is. These tricks are usually done to draw in a larger audience. Sometimes the trailers include footage not from the film itself. This could be an artistic choice, or because the trailer was put together before the film's final cut, but at other times it is to give the audience a different impression of the movie. Then trailers could be misleading in a 'for the audience's own good' kind of way, in that a general audience would not usually see such a film due to preconceptions, and by bait and switching, they can allow the audience to have a great viewing experience that they would not ordinarily have. However, the opposite is true too, with the promise of great trailers being let down by mediocre films. An American woman sued the makers of \"Drive\" because their film \"failed to live up to its promo's promise\", although her lawsuit was dismissed. In August 2016, an American lawyer attempted to sue \"Suicide Squad\" for false advertising over lack of scenes including Joker.\n\nTrailers tell the story of a film in a highly condensed fashion to have maximum appeal. In the decades since film marketing has become a large industry, trailers have become highly polished pieces of advertising, able to present even poor movies in an attractive light. Some of the elements common to many trailers are listed below. Trailers are typically made up of scenes from the film they are promoting, but sometimes contain deleted scenes from the film.\n\nThe key ambition in trailer-making is to impart an intriguing story that gets film audiences emotionally involved.\n\nMost trailers have a three-act structure similar to a feature-length film. They start with a beginning (act 1) that lays out the premise of the story. The middle (act 2) drives the story further and usually ends with a dramatic climax. Act 3 usually features a strong piece of \"signature music\" (either a recognizable song or a powerful, sweeping orchestral piece). This last act often consists of a visual montage of powerful and emotional moments of the film and may also contain a cast run if there are noteworthy stars that could help sell the movie.\n\nVoice-over narration is sometimes used to briefly set up the premise of the film and provide explanation when necessary, although this practice has declined in the years after the passing of voice-over artist Don LaFontaine. Since the trailer is a highly condensed format, voice-over is a useful tool to enhance the audience's understanding of the plot. Some of the best-known, modern-day trailer voice-over artists have been the aforementioned LaFontaine, Hal Douglas, Mark Elliott, John Leader, Corey Burton, George DelHoyo, Peter Cullen, Morgan Freeman, Ashton Smith, Jim Cummings, John Garry, Tom Kane, Nick Schatzki, Ben Patrick Johnson, Tony Rodgers, Beau Weaver, and Brian Cummings. Classic voice-over artists in film trailers of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s included Howard Strickling (for MGM), Lou Marcelle (for Warner Bros.), Art Gilmore, Knox Manning, Reed Hadley, Les Tremayne (for MGM), Fred Foy (for MGM), Karl Weber (for MGM) and Bob Marcato. Hollywood trailers of the classic film era were renowned for clichés such as \"Colossal!\", \"Stupendous!\", etc. Some trailers have used voice over clichés for satirical effect. This can be seen in trailers for films such as Jerry Seinfeld's Comedian and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.\n\nMusic helps set the tone and mood of the trailer. Usually the music used in the trailer is not from the film itself (the film score may not have been composed yet). The music used in the trailer may be:\n\n\nA \"cast run\" is a list of the stars that appear in the movie. If the director or producer is well-known or has made other popular movies, they often warrant a mention as well. Most trailers conclude with a billing block, which is a list of the principal cast and crew. It is the same list that appears on posters and print publicity materials, and also usually appears on-screen at the beginning (or end) of the movie. Studio production logos are usually featured near the beginning of the trailer. Until the late 1970s, they were put only at the end of the trailer or not used at all; however, Paramount Pictures was the first studio to use its actual studio logo at the beginning of its trailers in the 1940s. Often there will be logos for both the production company and distributor of the film.\n\nMany trailers are mixed in Dolby Digital or any other multichannel sound mix. Scenes including sound effects and music that are enhanced by stereophonic sound are therefore the focus point of many modern trailers.\n\nTrailers preceding feature films are generally presented in the same format as the feature, being either 35 mm film or a digital format. High bandwidth internet connections allow for trailers to be distributed online at any resolution. Since the advent of Digital 3‑D, it has become common for a 3‑D feature film to be preceded by one or more trailers that are also presented in 3‑D.\n\nNational Screen Service contracts required that trailers be returned (at the cinema's expense) or destroyed, however it required no proof of destruction and depositing them in a waste bin counted. A market for trailers evolved as it became clear that some had a commercial value to collectors. Many of the trailers for films like the \"Star Wars\" series reported as 'destroyed' were taken back out of the bin and sold by cinema staff. As they cost about $60 each to make (1981 estimate) and were hired to the cinema for $10, such losses led to NSS increasing its rental charges, which led to a decrease in the number of trailers rented and shown to audiences.\n\nSome cinemas also began to show \"trailer trash\" programs of trailers without a main feature. Similarly, several DVDs containing nothing but trailers for films, typically from exploitation film genres, have been produced for sale.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and along with the development of the Internet and sites such as YouTube as well as animation techniques, more types of trailers began to be created due to easier and cheaper costs to produce and show trailers.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, video game trailers began to be produced as they became more mainstream. Used to entice viewers to go out and play the game, game trailers are very useful. The content and production process is similar to that for movies, complicated by the need to convey the way the game plays. The trailer for Aliens: Colonial Marines, for example, featured graphics that were of a higher standard than the game that was eventually sold. Hideo Kojima, a game creator strongly influenced by Hollywood movies, edits the elaborate trailers for his own games from a special studio in his office.\n\nTV spots are trailers for movies shown on television that are often shortened to 30–60 seconds. These trailers are similar to green band trailers and have content \"appropriate\" for the channel.\n\nTV show trailers are trailers advertising a new TV series, episode, event or marathon premiering on television. Trailers for the next episode of a TV series are often shown during or following the closing credits of the show.\n\nA book trailer is a video advertisement for a book which employs techniques similar to those of movie trailers to promote books and encourage readers. These trailers can also be referred to as \"video-podcasts\", with higher quality trailers being called \"cinematic book trailers\". They are circulated on television and online in most common digital video formats. Common formats of book trailers include actors performing scenes from the book akin to a movie trailer, full production trailers, flash videos, animation or simple still photos set to music with text conveying the story. This differs from author readings and interviews, which consist of video footage of the author narrating a portion of their writing or being interviewed. Early book trailers consisted mostly of still images of the book, with some videos incorporating actors, with John Farris's book trailer for his 1986 novel \"Wildwood\" incorporating images from the book cover along with actors such as John Zacherle.\n\nIn September 2007, the \"School Library Journal\" established the Trailie Award for the best book trailers. There are three categories: author/publisher created, student created and librarian/adult created. The award was announced at the \"School Library Journal\" Leadership Summit on the Future of Reading on October 22, 2010 in Chicago.\n\nIn 2014, Dan Rosen and CV Herst established BookReels, a website dedicated to allowing publishers and authors to post book trailers and other multimedia, culminating in the annual BookReels Awards. BookReels lets readers browse and rate trailers, post comments and reviews, join discussion groups, and share BookReel discoveries.\n\nFor popular movies, fans often make trailers on their own. These are unofficial videos by fans utilizing audio or video of a movie, studio trailer, animation techniques or fan-acted scenes replacing the video of the official trailer.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) mandates that theatrical trailers be no longer than two minutes and thirty seconds. Each major studio is given one exception to this rule per year. Internet or home-video trailers have no time restrictions. \"Rating cards\" appear at the head of trailers in the United States which indicate how closely the trailer adheres to the MPAA's standards.\n\nA \"green band\" is an all-green graphic at the beginning of the trailer. Until April 2009, these cards indicated that they had been approved for \"all audiences\" and often included the movie's MPAA rating. This signified that the trailer adheres to the standards for motion picture advertising outlined by the MPAA, which include limitations on foul language and violent, sexual, or otherwise objectionable imagery. In April 2009, the MPAA began to permit the green band language to say that a trailer had been approved for \"appropriate\" audiences, meaning that the material would be appropriate for audiences in theaters, based on the content of the film they had come to see. In May 2013, the MPAA changed the trailer approval band from \"for appropriate audiences\" to \"to accompany this feature\", but only when accompanying a feature film; for bands not accompanying a feature film, the text of the band remained the same. The font and style of the text on the graphic bands (green and red) was also changed at the time the green band was revised in 2013.\n\nTrailers which do not adhere to these guidelines may be issued a \"red band\", which indicates approval for only \"restricted\" or \"mature\" audiences. These trailers may only be shown theatrically before R-rated, NC-17-rated, or unrated movies (only films that are released in theaters rated R and not in theaters rated PG-13). These trailers may include nudity, profanity, or other material deemed inappropriate for children.\n\nAdditionally, \"yellow band\" trailers were introduced around 2007 to indicate restricted content, only for distribution on the Internet. Although official, this practice appears to have never been widespread (although occasional yellow band trailers are created). A notable example is the yellow band trailer for Rob Zombie's \"Halloween\" (2007).\n\nEvery year there are two main events that give awards to outstanding film trailers: The Key Art Awards, presented by \"The Hollywood Reporter\", and the Golden Trailer Awards. The Golden Trailer Awards and the Key Art Awards pick winners in all creative parts of film advertising, from trailers and TV spots to posters and print ads. The Golden Trailer Awards are currently expanding to add a sister event, The World Trailer Awards, to be a kickoff to the Cannes Film Festival in France, 2013. The yearly Key Art Awards ceremony is often held at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood. \"The Film Informant\" also recognizes movie marketing media and held the first annual TFI Awards in early January 2012. The site is the first to officially start recognizing and rating movie marketing media on a daily basis.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "443855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=443855", "title": "William K. Wimsatt", "text": "William K. Wimsatt\n\nWilliam Kurtz Wimsatt Jr. (November 17, 1907 – December 17, 1975) was an American professor of English, literary theorist, and critic. Wimsatt is often associated with the concept of the intentional fallacy, which he developed with Monroe Beardsley in order to discuss the importance of an author's intentions for the creation of a work of art.\n\nWimsatt was born in Washington D.C., attended Georgetown University and, later, Yale University, where he received his Ph.D. In 1939, Wimsatt joined the English department at Yale, where he taught until his death in 1975. During his lifetime, Wimsatt became known for his studies of eighteenth-century literature (Leitch et al. 1372). He wrote many works of literary theory and criticism such as \"The Prose Style of Samuel Johnson\" (1941) and \"Philosophic Words: A Study of Style and Meaning in the \"Rambler\" and \"Dictionary\" of Samuel Johnson\" (1948; Leitch et al. 1372). His major works include \"The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry\" (1954); \"Hateful Contraries\" (1965) and \"Literary Criticism: A Short History\" (1957, with Cleanth Brooks). Wimsatt was considered crucial to New Criticism (particularly New Formalist Criticism; 1372). He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nWimsatt was influenced by Monroe Beardsley, with whom he wrote some of his most important pieces. Wimsatt also drew on the work of both ancient critics, such as Longinus and Aristotle, and some of his own contemporaries, such as T. S. Eliot and the writers of the Chicago School, to formulate his theories, often by highlighting key ideas in those authors' works in order to refute them.\n\nWimsatt's ideas have affected the development of reader-response criticism, and his influence has been noted in the works of writers such as Stanley Fish, and in works such as Walter Benn Michaels' and Steven Knapp’s “Against Theory” (Leitch et al. 1373-1374).\n\nWimsatt was interviewed, along with Walter J. Ong, S.J., of Saint Louis University, by Sheila Hough on the 327th edition of the radio talk-show Yale Reports, broadcast on May 24, 1964, by WTIC-Hartford. (Professor Wimsatt had received an honorary doctorate from Saint Louis University in 1963.) Ms. Hough asked Professor Wimsatt a question that still resonates today: \"Is literature taught in complete isolation from its author, Mr. Wimsatt -- don't you consider the person who wrote it?\"\n\nWimsatt replied: \"I do, of course. Your question, I think, was prompted by that very fine essay of Father Ong's, 'The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn,' which you read in his book \"The Barbarian Within\" [1962: 15-25]. It first appeared in \"Essays in Criticism\" at Oxford some years ago [1954], and was in part, I believe, an answer to an essay written many years ago, about twenty at least, by a friend of mine, Monroe Beardsley, and myself, called 'The Intentional Fallacy.' I would like to pay Father Ong the compliment of saying that I think that his essay 'The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn' is the only sensible response that has ever been written to that essay of ours.\"\n\nAs a staunch formalist critic, Wimsatt believed in the authority of the poem: any analysis of a poem must centre on the text itself (Leitch et al. 1371-1372). He outlines and advocates (particularly in his two influential essays written with Monroe Beardsley, “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy”) an “objective criticism” in which the critic essentially disregards the intentions of the poet and the effect of the poem on the audience as the sole (or even the major) factors in analyzing and evaluating a poem (Davis and Schleifer 43).\n\nWimsatt does allow for a certain degree of variation in the analysis of poetry and does not necessarily contend that there is only one possible reading for any given poem. He allows, for example, for what he calls the “literary sense” of meaning, saying that “no two different words or different phrases ever mean fully the same” (Verbal Icon xii).\n\nMuch of his theory, however, appears to stem from an ambivalence towards \"impressionism, subjectivism, and relativism” (Leitch et al. 1373) in criticism. In \"Hateful Contraries\", Wimsatt refers to a “New Amateurism,” an “anti-criticism” emerging in works such as Leslie Fiedler’s “Credo,” which appeared in the \"Kenyon Review\". “The only reservation the theorist need have about such critical impressionism or expressionism,” says Wimsatt, “is that, after all, it does not carry on very far in our cogitation about the nature and value of literature…it is not a very mature form of cognitive discourse” (\"Hateful Contraries\" xvi).\n\nIndeed, Wimsatt is concerned with ensuring a level of legitimacy in English studies and he sets about doing so by favouring a scientific approach to criticism—even, for example, decrying affective theory as “less a scientific view of literature than a prerogative -- that of a soul adventuring among masterpieces” (\"Verbal Icon\" 29).\n\nWimsatt contributed several theories to the critical landscape, particularly through his major work, \"The Verbal Icon\" (of which some of the ideas are discussed below). His ideas generally centre around the same questions tackled by many critics: what is poetry and how does one evaluate it?\n\nPerhaps Wimsatt’s most influential theories come from the essays “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy” (both are published in \"Verbal Icon\") which he wrote with Monroe Beardsley. Each of these texts “codifies a crucial tenet of New Critical formalist orthodoxy,” making them both very important to twentieth-century criticism (Leitch et al. 1371).\n\nThe Intentional Fallacy, according to Wimsatt, derives from “confusion between the poem and its origins” (\"Verbal Icon\" 21) – essentially, it occurs when a critic puts too much emphasis on personal, biographical, or what he calls “external” information when analyzing a work (they note that this is essentially the same as the “Genetic fallacy” in philosophical studies; 21). Wimsatt and Beardsley consider this strategy a fallacy partly because it is impossible to determine the intention of the author — indeed, authors themselves are often unable to determine the “intention” of a poem — and partly because a poem, as an act that takes place between a poet and an audience, has an existence outside of both and thus its meaning can not be evaluated simply based on the intentions of or the effect on either the writer or the audience(see the section of this article entitled “The Affective Fallacy\" for a discussion of the latter; 5). For Wimsatt and Beardsley, intentional criticism becomes subjective criticism, and so ceases to be criticism at all. For them, critical inquiries are resolved through evidence in and of the text — not “by consulting the oracle” (18).\n\nThe Affective fallacy (identified in the essay of the same name, which Wimsatt co-authored with Monroe Beardsley, as above) refers to “confusion between the poem and its \"results\"” (\"Verbal Icon 21\"; italics in original). It refers to the error of placing too much emphasis on the effect that a poem has on its audience when analyzing it.\n\nWimsatt and Beardsley argue that the effect of poetic language alone is an unreliable way to analyze poetry because, they contend, words have no effect in and of themselves, independent of their meaning. It is impossible, then, for a poem to be “pure emotion” (38), which means that a poem’s meaning is not “equivalent to its effects, especially its emotional impact, on the reader” (Leitch et al. 1371).\n\nAs with the Intentional fallacy, engaging in affective criticism is too subjective an exercise to really warrant the label “criticism” at all — thus, for Wimsatt and Beardsley, it is a fallacy of analysis.\n\nIn “The Concrete Universal,” Wimsatt attempts to determine how specific or general (i.e., concrete or universal) a verbal representation must be in order to achieve a particular effect. What is the difference, for example, between referring to a “purple cow” and a “tan cow with a broken horn” (\"Verbal Icon\" 74)? In addressing such questions, Wimsatt attempts to resolve what it is that makes poetry different from other forms of communication, concluding that “what distinguishes poetry from scientific or logical discourse is a degree of concreteness which does not contribute anything to the argument but is somehow enjoyable or valuable for its own sake.” For Wimsatt, poetry is “the vehicle of a metaphor which one boards heedless of where it runs, whether cross-town or downtown — just for the ride” (76).\n\nIn “The Domain of Criticism,” Wimsatt “[defends] the domain of poetry and poetics from the encircling (if friendly) arm of the general aesthetician\" (\"Verbal Icon\" 221) – that is, he discusses the problems with discussing poetry in purely aesthetic terms. Wimsatt questions the ability of a poem to function aesthetically in the same way as a painting or sculpture. For one, visual modes such as sculpture or painting are undertaken using materials that directly correlate with the object they represent — at least in terms of their “beauty.” A beautiful painting of an apple, for example, is done with beautiful paint.\n\nVerbal expression, however, does not function this way — as Wimsatt points out, there is no such thing as a “beautiful” or “ugly” word (or, at least, there is no general consensus as to how to apply such concepts in such a context; 228). There is no correlation between words and their subject, at least in terms of aesthetics — “the example of the dunghill (or equivalent object) beautifully described is one of the oldest in literary discussion” (228).\n\nMore importantly, language does not function merely on the level of its effects on the senses, as (for example) visual modes do. A poem does not just derive its meaning from its rhyme and meter, but these are the domains of aesthetics (231) — to analyse poetry on the basis of its aesthetics, then, is insufficient in one is to adequately explore its meaning.\n\nWritten as a series of independent essays between 1941 and 1952, \"The Verbal Icon\" was finally published as a cohesive work (after Wimsatt revised some of the original versions) in 1954. Probably his most influential work, \"The Verbal Icon\" contains two of Wimsatt's most important essays, “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy” (co-authored with Monroe Beardsley). Paul de Man offers a significant critique of Wimsatt's text, taken as an example of the understanding of the notion of 'autonomy' in New Criticism, in \"Blindness and Insight\".\n\nApparently concerned with the (admittedly lessened) influence of what he calls “Amateur Criticism,” Wimsatt published \"Hateful Contraries\" in 1965 as a way to “distinguish what [he] consider[s] an inevitable and proper literary interest in the contraries” (Hateful Contraries xviii). Through studies of works by T. S. Eliot as well as discussions of topics such as “The Augustan Mode in English Poetry” and “The Criticism of Comedy” (xi), Wimsatt attempts to add to the efforts to justify and improve literary criticism (xix).\n\nWritten with Cleanth Brooks in 1957, \"Literary Criticism: A Short History\" is intended as “a history of ideas about verbal art and about its elucidation and criticism” (Wimsatt and Brooks ix). The authors attempt to contribute to the “intelligibility in the history of literary argument” as well as “contributes to a distinct point of view,” which, they argue, is a necessary part of any historical literary studies (vii).\n\n\n"}
