{"id": "10722339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10722339", "title": "Architectural reprography", "text": "Architectural reprography\n\nArchitectural reprography, the reprography of architectural drawings, covers a variety of technologies, media, and supports typically used to make multiple copies of original technical drawings and related records created by architects, landscape architects, engineers, surveyors, mapmakers and other professionals in building and engineering trades.\n\nWithin the context of , the custodians of architectural records must consider many aspects of identification and care when managing the artifactual nature of these materials. Storage containers, handling, paper and chemical compositions and interactions, ultraviolet light exposure, humidity, mold, and other agents of potential harm all interact to determine the longevity of these documents. As well, architectural reprographic drawings are often in very large formats, making storage and handling decisions especially complex.\n\nWith the rise of the professionalized practice of western architecture in the second half of the 19th century, the field of architectural reprography—and the corresponding developments of photography and mass-produced wood-pulp paper—saw significant experiments and advances in technology. Beginning with major refinements in blueprinting processes in the 1840s, through the widespread adoption of diazotype printing after World War II, the design profession turned to analog architectural reprography to create accurate, to-scale reproductions of original drawings created on tracing paper, vellum, and linen supports. These copies were typically used throughout the architect’s own design process and also for distribution to clients, contractors, governmental agencies, and other interested parties. However, the integration of CAD—or Computer-Aided Design—over the last twenty-five years of design practice has made analog reprography far less common in the profession and more ephemeral in nature. For archivists, curators, librarians and other custodians of architectural records, traditional reprographic formats are now often seen as historic documents, with attendant needs for long-term care and conservation.\n\nBoth the underlying support—paper or plastic—and the image type are used to identify the specific processes used in architectural reprography. Between the late 19th century and the late 20th century, several processes emerged as the preferred methods, used for decades, while other less common processes were employed for shorter periods of time.\n\nFirst developed in 1725, blueprinting uses a wet process to produce an image of white lines on a cyan or Prussian blue ground. To make a blueprint, a heavy paper (or more rarely drafting linen) support is impregnated with potassium ferricyanide and ferric ammonium, placed under a translucent original drawing, weighted with glass, and exposed to ultraviolet light. After sufficient light exposure, the glass and original drawing are removed and the blueprint paper is washed to reveal a negative image. This same process, using an intermediary reprographic drawing, could also be used to produce a positive blueprint—blue lines on a white ground—however, this more expensive and time-intensive method was far less commonly employed.\n\nThe major disadvantages of the blueprint process, however, included paper distortions caused by the wet process which might render scale drawings less accurately, as well as the inability to make further copies from the blueprints. Nonetheless, for its efficiency and low cost, the blueprint process, further simplified and mechanized by the turn of the 20th century, became the most widely used reprographic process from the mid-19th century through the first half of the 20th century.\n\nIn archival settings, because the process involves ammonium, the resulting prints should not be stored in contact with other papers that have a buffered reserve, nor should blueprints be de-acidified, as the resulting chemical interactions can cause irreversible image loss. Blueprints are also highly light-sensitive and should not be exposed to ultraviolet light for long periods of time.\n\nInvented in 1887 by Henry Pellet, the Pellet process uses a wet process to produce an image of cyan or Prussian blue lines on a white ground. Essentially, this process produces a positive image, while a blueprint produces a negative one. To make a Pellet print, a paper (or more rarely drafting linen) support is coated with ferric salts suspended in a gelatin emulsion, placed under a translucent original drawing, weighted with glass, and exposed to ultraviolet light. As with the blueprint process, after sufficient light exposure, the original drawing is removed, the paper washed in a ferrocyanide bath, and then rinsed in an acidic bath to reveal a positive image. This process required fewer steps than creating a positive blueprint, and was thus more widely employed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nIn an archival setting, Pellet prints should be treated and stored under the same conditions as blueprints.\n\nThe Van Dyke process, invented by F. R. Van Dyke in 1901, created an intermediary print—a white line on a dark brown ground—that could used in any of several other processes, such as blueprinting, to create a positive print, i.e. a dark line on a light ground. \n\nUsing a translucent vellum support, the paper was prepared with a coating of silver salts. The vellum was then united with the original drawing, exposed to ultraviolet light, and later washed in a sodium thiosulfate bath.\n\nIn an archival setting, Van Dyke prints are relatively rare, as they were created for temporary purposes and often discarded after the final positive prints were made. Because of the nitrates used in preparing the paper and the preferred thin paper itself, Van Dyke prints are often extremely brittle and susceptible to damage. Van Dyke prints should be stored separately and, when possible reformatted before the image degrades unacceptably.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, wet-process reprographic techniques such as blueprinting, Pellet, and Van Dyke printing were largely superseded by various dry-printing processes. The most common of these is the Diazotype process, refined in the 1920s, which used paper supports sensitized with diazonium salts, a coupling agent, and an acid stabilizer to produce a dark line on a white ground. The Diazo positive print was considered more readable than a negative blueprint, and the dry process eliminated the image distortion of wet paper.\n\nAs with other earlier reprographic processes, a translucent original drawing was placed over a sheet of the sensitized paper and exposed to light. However, the next step exposed the paper to an ammonia gas. This alkaline gas catalyzed a reaction between the diazo salts and the coupling agent to produce an image that fixed in the paper over several days. Typically these prints have blue or dark purple lines on a mottled cream-colored background, although line and ground colors can vary.\n\nA related process is the sepia Diazo print, which produced either a positive or negative print in dark brown and light tones. The negative versions of these prints were most often produced as intermediaries, like the earlier Van Dyke process, to allow corrections and revisions without disturbing the original drawing. In the negative printing process, additional resins and oils were sometimes added to the paper support to increase translucency. Positive sepia prints, generally made on opaque paper, were typically used as an alternative to positive blueline Diazo prints.\n\nBoth blueline and sepia prints were often poorly and cheaply processed, resulting in undesirable residual chemical content. Off-gassing of sulfurous compounds, image fading, and yellowing of the paper support are common signs of degradation and are not reversible. Diazo prints are also highly light-sensitive and can fade to illegibility within a short period of exposure to ultraviolet light.\n\nIn archival practice, Diazo prints are the most common reprographic format encountered in late 20th-century architectural collections. However, their inherent fragility and fugitive images, as compared with blueprints and earlier processes, makes their care problematic. Diazos—particularly sepia prints, which readily transfer color to adjacent papers—should be physically segregated from all other types of media. Exposure to light and pollutants in air should be minimized, and wherever possible, original drawings or reformatted prints should be kept for reference.\n\n\nFor large collections of architectural materials, conservation work can address several areas of concern. Consultation with a professional conservator is recommended, although some minor treatments can be accomplished by general caretakers with training. Rolled and folded reprography, once cleaned, can be flattened through humidification. Cleaning may be done with white vinyl erasers, using great care in areas of friable media, such as graphite and colored pencil. Tears, losses, and other surface damage should be treated by a professional conservator. For particularly fragile or frequently-handled prints, sheets may be encapsulated in polyester or polypropylene film for additional support and protection. This is not recommended, however, for reprographic prints with annotations in friable media.\n\nThe most common form of storage for architectural drawings—both for drawings in active professional use and in archival environments—has traditionally been in rolls. While this allows for efficiency in the use of space and ease of retrieval, potentially damaging situations can arise from a casual approach to roll storage. For reprographic drawings on paper supports, rolling can stress paper fibers and make unrolling for examination more difficult. Small rolls can be easily crushed and ends can be creased and torn without additional protective wrapping and support.\n\nIn circumstances where fragile, rigid, or otherwise atypical media makes rolled storage unfeasible, storage in flat boxes or flatfile drawers can be the best choice. Acid-free and lignin-free portfolio boxes, ideally no more than four inches deep, can be cost-effective and allow more flexibility in arrangement on shelving. Flatfile furniture should meet the minimum requirements of archivally-sound construction—powder- or enamel-coated steel units with no rust or sharp edges that could damage materials while stored or moved in and out of the drawers.\n\nDrawings should be grouped and identified for ease in retrieval, preferably within folders that are cut to fit the full dimensions of the corresponding container. As with rolled materials, the potentially damaging chemical interactions of print processes should be considered when grouping drawings in folders. Wherever possible, for example, blueprints should be segregated from diazotypes, and sepia diazo prints should be stored alone to the extent possible.\n\nFor most drawings, especially those that are oversized or significantly damaged, photographic reproduction remains the best method of accurately reproducing the fine details of a drawing. For drawings that are not significantly damaged or that are encapsulated in a polyester film, digital flat-bed scanning or other mechanical methods may be used.\n\nThe Society of American Archivists supports many architectural archivists in their professional responsibilities. In particular, the SAA's Architectural Records Roundtable is a primary forum for discussion of issues of acquisition, identification, description, conservation, and digital preservation of a wide variety of architectural documentation.\n\n"}

The purpose is to ensure that the decision-makers do not make snap judgements and are evaluating the person solely on performance, with no consideration of appearance, name, gender, educational background, previous work experience or other implicit bias.\n\nResearch published in \"American Economic Review\" suggests the use of blind auditions also changed the role that gender apparently plays during auditions. According to a 2001 study by Cecilia Rouse of Princeton and Claudia Goldin of Harvard, the introduction of blind auditions to American symphony orchestras increased the probability that a woman would advance from preliminary rounds by 50 percent. According to the study, among those symphonies, \"about 10 percent of orchestra members were female around 1970, compared to about 35 percent in the mid-1990s. Rouse and Goldin attribute about 30 percent of this gain to the advent of blind auditions.\"\n\nJazz bassist and clinical psychologist Art Davis is known for launching a legal case which led to the current system of blind auditions for orchestras.\n\nIn 2010, the competitive talent show \"The Voice of Holland\" introduced the use of blind auditions to televised talent shows; the format was then quickly franchised to dozens of other countries.\n\nInspired by \"The Voice\", technology company GapJumpers is using blind auditions to help tech companies evaluate job candidates based on their actual performance. This approach also allows employers in Silicon Valley to bridge their diversity gap.\n\nBlind performance auditions, much research has proven, often results in the hiring of more women and minorities because it eliminates the opportunities for bias to influence who makes the cut.\n\nBlind auditions, also termed 'Blind hiring' is a solution used by large enterprises in Silicon Valley to make objective talent decisions by interrupting cognitive bias.\n\nDolby Laboratories said it recently hired an engineering intern who probably would have otherwise been passed over due to a lack of experience and academic pedigree.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief at VentureBeat announced Blind Auditions for his publication to hire new tech journalists. Based in the center of the Silicon Valley tech startup scene, VentureBeat's leader is hoping that his new approach will lead to more women journalists covering tech, but even he admits that only time will tell.\n\nThe Today Show reported that companies are using blind auditions to hire talent for their performance rather than race, gender and socio-economic backgrounds.\n\nA study by Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan suggests that racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market.\n"}
{"id": "18619209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18619209", "title": "Bloody Mary (folklore)", "text": "Bloody Mary (folklore)\n\nBloody Mary is a folklore legend consisting of a ghost, phantom, or spirit conjured to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is chanted repeatedly. The Bloody Mary apparition may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend. Bloody Mary appearances are mostly \"witnessed\" in group participation play.\n\nHistorically, the ritual encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backward holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see a skull (or the face of the Grim Reaper) instead, indicating that they were going to die before they would have the chance to marry.\n\nIn the ritual of today, Bloody Mary allegedly appears to individuals or groups who ritualistically invoke her name in an act of catoptromancy. This is done by repeatedly chanting her name into a mirror placed in a dimly-lit or candle-lit room. In some traditions the name must be repeated thirteen times (or some other specified number of times). The Bloody Mary apparition allegedly appears as a corpse, witch or ghost, can be friendly or evil, and is sometimes \"seen\" covered in blood. The lore surrounding the ritual states that participants may endure the apparition screaming at them, cursing them, strangling them, stealing their soul, drinking their blood, or scratching their eyes out. Some variations of the ritual call Bloody Mary by a different name—\"Hell Mary\" and \"Mary Worth\" are popular examples. The modern legend of Hanako-san in Japan strongly parallels the Bloody Mary mythology.\n\nThe modern addition of taunting Bloody Mary regarding her baby indicates the legendary figure's conflation with the historic figure Queen Mary I, also known as \"Bloody Mary\", whose life was marked by a number of miscarriages or false pregnancies and is remembered for her violent religious reforms.\n\nStaring into a mirror in a dimly-lit room for a prolonged period can cause one to hallucinate. Facial features may appear to \"melt\", distort, disappear, and rotate, while other hallucinatory elements, such as animal or strange faces, may appear. Giovanni Caputo of the University of Urbino, writes that this phenomenon, which he calls the \"strange-face illusion\", is believed to be a consequence of a \"dissociative identity effect\", which causes the brain's facial-recognition system to misfire in a currently unidentified way. Other possible explanations for the phenomenon include illusions attributed, at least partially, to the perceptual effects of \"Troxler's fading\", and possibly self-hypnosis.\n\nThe legend of Bloody Mary has served as inspiration for a number of movies, television shows, and video games dealing with the supernatural.\n\n\n"}

The film stars Dominique Labourier as Julie and Juliet Berto as Céline.\n\nIt won the Special Prize of the Jury at the Locarno International Film Festival in 1974 and was an Official Selection at the 1974 New York Film Festival. Marilù Parolini worked as the set photographer.\n\nThe film begins with Julie sitting on a park bench reading a book of magic spells when a woman (Céline) walks past, and begins dropping (à la Lewis Carroll's White Rabbit) various possessions. Julie begins picking them up, and tries to follow Céline around Paris, sometimes at a great pace (for instance, sprinting up Montmartre to keep pace with Céline's tram). After adventures following Céline around the Parisian streets — at one point it looks as if they have gone their separate ways, never to meet up again — Céline finally decides to move in with Julie. There are incidents of identity swapping, with Céline pretending to be Julie to meet the latter's childhood sweetheart, for example, and Julie attempting to fill in for Céline at a cabaret audition.\n\nThe second half of the film centers around the duo's individual visits to 7 bis, rue du Nadir-aux-Pommes, the address of a mansion in a quiet, walled off grounds in Paris. While seemingly empty and closed in the present day, the house is yet where Céline realizes she knows as the place where she works as a nanny for a family — two jealous sisters, one widower, and a sickly child. Soon, a repetitive pattern emerges: Céline or Julie enters the house, disappears for a time, and then is suddenly ejected by unseen hands back to present day Paris later that same day. Each time either Céline or Julie is exhausted, having forgotten everything that has happened during their time in the house. However, each time upon returning via a taxi the women discover a candy mysteriously lodged in their mouth. It seems to be important, so each makes sure to carefully save the candy. At one point, they realize that the candy is a key to the other place and time; sucking on the sweet transports them back to the house's alternate reality (in this case a double reference to both Lewis Carroll and to Marcel Proust's madeleine) of the day's events.\n\nThe remainder of the film consists of the two women attempting to solve the central mystery of the house: amidst the jealous conniving of women of the house over the attentions of the widower, a young child is mysteriously murdered. But this narrative is one that repeats like a stage play, with exact phrases they soon learn well enough to start joking about. Each time they repeat eating the candy, they remember more of the day's events. Just as if reading a favorite novel, or again watching a beloved movie, they find that they can enter the narrative itself, with each twist and turn memorized. Far from being the passive viewers/readers that they were at first — and most movie viewers always are — the women come to realize that they can seize hold of the story, changing it as they wish.\n\nNow, even as the plot continues to unfold in its clockwork fashion, the women begin to take control, making it \"interactive\" by adding alterations to their dialogues and inserting different actions into the events unreeling in the house. Finally, in a true act of authorship, they change the ending, and rescue the young girl who was originally murdered. Both realities are fully conjoined when, after their rescue of the girl from the House of Fiction, the two not only discover themselves transported back in Julie's apartment, but this time it isn't another \"waking dream\" for the young girl, Madlyn, has joined them, safely back in 1970s Paris.\n\nTo relax, Céline, Julie, and Madlyn take a rowboat on a placid river, rowing and gliding happily along. But something isn't quite right. They go silent upon seeing another boat quickly coming to pass them on the water. On that boat we see the three main protagonists from the house-of-another-time: that alternate reality has followed them back to their world. But Céline, Julie, and Madlyn see them as the antique props they are, frozen in place.\n\nThe film ends as we watch Céline this time, half nodding off on a park bench, who catches sight of Julie hurrying past her, who in her White Rabbit way, drops her magic book. Picking it up, she calls and runs after Julie.\n\nMagic is one of the themes of the film. Céline, the stage magician, does her magic tricks in a nightclub performance. Magic seems to come too from Julie's Tarot card readings. Finally, \"real\" magic comes from the design of a potion, which enables both women to enter the house and take charge of the narrative.\n\nAt the start, the two women are leading relatively conventional lives, each having jobs (Julie, a librarian, is more conservative and sensible than Céline, a stage magician, with her bohemian lifestyle). As the film develops, Céline and Julie separate from the world by leaving their jobs, moving in together, and gradually becoming obsessed with the mysterious and magical events in the old house.\n\nIn one scene, according to critic Irina Janakievska, Julie is playing Tarot cards, with one of the cards interpreted as signifying that Julie's future is behind her — exactly when we see Céline, wearing a disguise, observing Julie from one of the library desks. As Céline draws an outline of her hand in one of the books, Julie echoes that as she plays with a red ink pad.\n\nAnother noticeable aspect of the film is its use of puns. For instance, the title of the film, \"Céline et Julie vont en bateau\", has other meanings from that of taking a boat ride: \"aller en bateau\" also means \"to get caught up in a story that someone is telling you\", or, in English, getting taken up in a \"shaggy dog story\".\n\nLuc Béraud was assistant director on the movie.\n\nThe film references Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", Henry James' \"The Romance of Certain Old Clothes\", Bioy Casares's \"La invención de Morel\", and Louis Feuillade's \"Les Vampires\" (Gaumont, 1915).\n\n\"Celine and Julie Go Boating\" is among Rivette's most acclaimed works. The film received 15 total votes – including one from the revered critic David Thomson – in the British Film Institute's 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" polls, and the aggregation site \"They Shoot Pictures, Don't They\" has found it to be the 177th most celebrated movie ever made. Rotten Tomatoes also reports 95% approval among 22 critics, with an average rating of 8/10.\n\n"}

The film centers in the life of German-Jewish philosopher and political theorist Hannah Arendt. It is distributed by Zeitgeist Films in the United States, where it opened theatrically on 29 May 2013.\n\nGerman director von Trotta's film centers on Arendt's response to the 1961 trial of Nazi Adolf Eichmann, which she covered for \"The New Yorker\". Her writing on the trial became controversial for its depiction of both Eichmann and the Jewish councils, and for its introduction of Arendt's now-famous concept of \"the banality of evil\". \n\nAs the film opens Eichmann has been captured in South America. It is revealed that he escaped there via the \"rat line\" and with forged papers. Arendt, now a professor in New York, volunteers to write about the trial for \"The New Yorker\" and is given the assignment. Observing the trial, she is impressed by how ordinary and mediocre Eichmann appears. She had expected someone scary, a monster, and he does not seem to be that. In a cafe conversation in which the Faust story is raised it is mentioned that Eichmann is not in any way a Mephisto (the devil). Returning to New York, Arendt has massive piles of transcripts to go through. Her husband has a brain aneurysm, almost dying, and causing her further delay. She continues to struggle with how Eichmann rationalized his behavior through platitudes about bureaucratic loyalty, and that he was just doing his job. When her material is finally published, it immediately creates enormous controversy, resulting in angry phone calls and a falling out with her old friend, Hans Jonas.\n\nIn a night out on the town with her friend, novelist Mary McCarthy, she insists that she is being misunderstood, and her critics who accuse her of \"defending\" Eichmann have not read her work. McCarthy broaches the subject of Arendt's love relationship many years ago with philosopher Martin Heidegger who had collaborated with the Nazis. Arendt finds herself shunned by many colleagues and former friends. The film closes with a final speech she gives before a group of students, in which she says this trial was about a new type of crime which did not previously exist. A court had to define Eichmann as a man on trial for his deeds. It was not a system or an ideology that was on trial, only a man. But Eichmann was a man who renounced all qualities of personhood, thus showing that great evil is committed by \"nobodies\" without motives or intentions. This is what she calls \"the banality of evil\".\n\nThe film, which captures Arendt at one of the pivotal moments of her life and career, also features portrayals of other prominent intellectuals, including philosopher Martin Heidegger, novelist Mary McCarthy and \"New Yorker\" editor William Shawn.\n\n\n\n\"Hannah Arendt\" makes use of original film footage from the 1961 Eichmann trial, in black & white, as well as the real testimony of survivors and the prosecutor, Gideon Hausner.\n\n\"Hannah Arendt\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes classified the film as \"fresh\" giving a 88% approval rating among 66 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.8/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Led by a powerful performance from Barbara Sukowa, \"Hannah Arendt\" does a commendable job of dramatizing the life of a complex public figure.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 69%, based on 17 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"\"Hannah Arendt\" conveys the glamour, charisma and difficulty of a certain kind of German thought. Ms. Sukowa, compact and energetic and not overly concerned with impersonation, captures Arendt’s fearsome cerebral power, as well as her warmth and, above all, the essential, unappeasable curiosity that drove her... Its climax, in which Arendt defends herself against critics, matches some of the great courtroom scenes in cinema and provides a stirring reminder that the labor of figuring out the world is necessary, difficult and sometimes genuinely heroic.\"\n-A. O. Scott, \"The New York Times\" \n\n\"To make a film about a thinker is a challenge; to do so in a way that is accessible and gripping is a triumph. Hannah Arendt herself might have been surprised to learn that after fifty years of deadening controversy, it is a film that promises to provoke the serious public debate she sought in publishing her book.\n-Roger Berkowitz, \"The Paris Review\"\n\n"}

His most prolific period of painting and drawing occurred between 1816 and 1831.\n\nAlken was born on 12 October 1785 in Soho, Westminster, and baptised on 6 November at St James's Church, Piccadilly. He was the third son of Samuel Alken, a sporting artist. Two of his brothers were George and Samuel Alken the Younger, also an artist. In 1789, the Alken family moved from Soho to 2, Francis Street East, Bedford Square.\n\nYoung Henry first studied under his father and then with the miniature painter John Thomas Barber Beaumont (1774–1841), also known as J. T. Barber. In 1801, Alken sent a miniature portrait of Miss Gubbins to the Royal Academy Exhibition. He exhibited a second miniature at the Royal Academy before abandoning miniature painting and taking on painting and illustrating. Early in his career, he painted sporting subjects under the name of \"Ben Tally-O\". Alken married Maria Gordon on 14 October 1809 at St Clement’s Church, Ipswich. On 22 August of the following year later the couple's first son was baptised. Alken went on to father five children, of whom two were artists, Samuel Henry, also a sporting artist, known as Henry Alken junior, and Sefferien junior.\n\nFrom about 1816 onwards Alken \"produced an unending stream of paintings, drawings and engravings of every type of field and other sporting activity,\" and his soft-ground etchings were often colored by hand. When Alken was 26, he and his young family lived over a shop in Haymarket that belonged to print publisher Thomas McLean of the \"Repository of Wit and Humour.\" McLean paid Alken a daily wage of thirty shillings, considered a good income at the time.\n\nAlken died in April 1851 and was buried in Highgate cemetery. Although fairly affluent for most of his career, he fell on hard times towards the end of his life and was buried at his daughter's expense.\n\nAlken worked in both oil and watercolor and was a skilled etcher. His earliest productions were published anonymously under the signature of \"Ben Tallyho\", but in 1816 he issued \"The Beauties & Defects in the Figure of the Horse comparatively delineated\" under his own name. From this date until about 1831, he produced many sets of etchings of sporting subjects mostly coloured and sometimes humorous in character, the principal of which were: \"Humorous Specimens of Riding\" 1821, \"Symptoms of being amazed\" 1822, \"Symptoms of being amused\" 1822, \"Flowers from Nature\" 1823, \"A Touch at the Fine Arts\" 1824, and \"Ideas\" 1830. Besides these he published a series of books: \"Illustrations for Landscape Scenery and Scraps from the Sketch Book of Henry Alken\" in 1823, \"New Sketch Book\" in 1824, \"Sporting Scrap Book\" and \"Shakespeare's Seven Ages\" in 1827, \"Sporting Sketches\" and in 1831 Illustrations to Popular Songs and Illustrations of Don Quixote, the latter engraved by John Christian Zeitter.\n\nAlken provided the plates picturing hunting, coaching, racing and steeplechasing for \"The National Sports of Great Britain\" (London, 1821). Alken, known as an avid sportsman,is best remembered for his hunting prints, many of which he engraved himself until the late 1830s. (Charles Lane British Racing Prints pp. 75–76). He created prints for the leading sporting printsellers such as S. and J. Fuller, Thomas McLean, and Rudolph Ackermann, and often collaborated with his friend the sporting journalist Charles James Apperley (1779–1843), also known as Nimrod. Nimrod's \"Life of a Sportsman\", with 32 etchings by Alken, was published by Ackermann in 1842. In many of his etchings, Alken explored the comic side of riding and satirized the foibles of aristocrats, much in the tradition of other early 19th century omthe oldest of the great foxhound packs in Leicestershire. A collection of his illustrations can be seen in the print department of the British Museum.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He sought to address whether the working class in fact exists, and how the masses of workers that thinkers like Althusser referred to continuously enter into a relationship with knowledge, particularly the limits of philosophers' knowledge with respect to the proletariat. An example of this line of thinking is Rancière's book entitled \"Le philosophe et ses pauvres\" (\"The Philosopher and His Poor\", 1983), a book about the role of the poor in the intellectual lives of philosophers.\n\nMore recently Rancière has written on the topic of human rights and specifically the role of international human rights organizations in asserting the authority to determine which groups of people, again the problem of masses, justify human rights interventions and even war.\n\nRancière's book, \"\" (original title \"Le Maître ignorant: Cinq leçons sur l'émancipation intellectuelle\", published in 1987) was written for educators and educators-to-be. Through the story of Joseph Jacotot, Rancière challenges his readers to consider equality as a starting point rather than a destination. In doing so, he asks educators to abandon the themes and rhetoric of cultural deficiency and salvation. Rather than requiring informed schoolmasters to guide students towards prescribed and alienating ends, Rancière argues that educators can channel the equal intelligence in all to facilitate their intellectual growth in virtually unlimited directions. The schoolmaster need not know anything (and may be ignorant). Rancière begins with the premises that all are of equal intelligence and that any collective educational exercise founded on this principle can provide the insights from which knowledge is constructed. He claims that the poor and disenfranchised should feel perfectly able to teach \"themselves\" whatever it is they want to know. Furthermore, anyone can lead, and the oppressed should not feel bound to experts or reliant on others for their intellectual emancipation.\n\nJacotot advocated the 'equality of intelligence' and claimed that an ignorant person could teach another ignorant person. Rancière developed this idea in \"The Ignorant Schoolmaster\", saying that “there is stultification whenever one intelligence is subordinated to another ... whoever teaches without emancipating stultifies”.\n\nIn 2006, it was reported that Rancière's aesthetic theory had become a point of reference in the visual arts, and Rancière has lectured at such art world events as the Frieze Art Fair. Former French presidential candidate Ségolène Royal described Rancière as her favourite philosopher. Among those intellectuals influenced by his work, Gabriel Rockhill has developed a new paradigm for thinking the historical relation between aesthetics and politics in close dialogue with Rancière's writings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "141557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=141557", "title": "Joe Shuster", "text": "Joe Shuster\n\nJoseph Shuster (; July 10, 1914 – July 30, 1992) was a Canadian-American comic book artist best known for co-creating the DC Comics character Superman, with writer Jerry Siegel, in \"Action Comics\" #1 (cover-dated June 1938).\n\nShuster was involved in a number of legal battles over ownership of the Superman character. His comic book career after Superman was relatively unsuccessful, and by the mid-1970s Shuster had left the field completely due to partial blindness.\n\nHe and Siegel were inducted into both the comic book industry's Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1993. In 2005, the Canadian Comic Book Creator Awards Association instituted the Joe Shuster Awards, named to honor the Canada-born artist.\n\nJoseph Shuster was born in Toronto, to a Jewish family. His father, Julius Shuster (originally Shusterowich), an immigrant from Rotterdam, had a tailor shop in Toronto's garment district. His mother, Ida (Katharske), had come from Kiev in Ukraine. His family, including his sister, Jean, lived on Bathurst, Oxford, and Borden Streets, and Shuster attended Ryerson and Lansdowne Public Schools. One of his cousins was comedian Frank Shuster of the Canadian comedy team Wayne and Shuster. He also had a brother named Frank.\n\nAs a youngster, Shuster worked as a newspaper boy for the \"Toronto Daily Star\". The family barely made ends meet, and the budding young artist would scrounge for paper, which the family could not afford. He recalled in 1992,\n\nSometime in 1924, when Shuster was 9 or 10, his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio. There Shuster attended Glenville High School and befriended his later collaborator, writer Jerry Siegel, with whom he began publishing a science fiction fanzine called \"Science Fiction\". Siegel described his friendship with the similarly shy and bespectacled Shuster: \"When Joe and I first met, it was like the right chemicals coming together.\"\n\nThe duo broke into comics at Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson's National Allied Publications, the future DC Comics, working on the landmark \"New Fun\"—the first comic-book series to consist solely of original material rather than using any reprinted newspaper comic strips—debuting with the musketeer swashbuckler \"Henri Duval\" and the supernatural crime-fighter strip Doctor Occult, both in \"New Fun\" #6 (Oct. 1935). In a 1992 interview, in which he used the fledgling publisher's future name, he said the two sample strips were not the ones eventually published:\n\nSiegel and Shuster created a bald telepathic villain, bent on dominating the world, as the title character in the short story \"The Reign of the Superman\", published in Siegel's 1933 fanzine \"Science Fiction\" #3. The character was not successful, and Siegel eventually devised the more familiar version of the character. Shuster modeled the hero on Douglas Fairbanks Sr., and his bespectacled alter ego, Clark Kent, on a combination of Harold Lloyd and Shuster himself, with the name \"Clark Kent\" derived from movie stars Clark Gable and Kent Taylor. Lois Lane was modelled on Joanne Carter, who was Joe's girlfriend before she became Siegel's wife.\n\nSiegel and Shuster then began a 6-year quest to find a publisher. Titling it \"The Superman\", Siegel and Shuster offered it to Consolidated Book Publishing, who had published a 48-page black-and-white comic book entitled \"Detective Dan: Secret Operative\" #48. Although the duo received an encouraging letter, Consolidated never again published comic books. Shuster took this to heart and, by varying accounts, either burned every page of the story, with the cover surviving only because Siegel saved it from the fire, or he tore the story to shreds, with only two cover sketches remaining. Siegel and Shuster each compared this character to Slam Bradley, an adventurer the pair had created for \"Detective Comics\" #1 (March 1937). In 1938, after that proposal had languished among others at \"More Fun Comics\" — published by National Allied Publications, the primary precursor of DC Comics — editor Vin Sullivan chose it as the cover feature for National's \"Action Comics\" #1 (June 1938). The following year, Siegel & Shuster initiated the syndicated \"Superman\" comic strip.\n\nAs part of the deal which saw Superman published in \"Action Comics\", Siegel and Shuster sold the rights to the company in return for $130 and a contract to supply the publisher with material.\n\nSiegel and Shuster's status as children of Jewish immigrants is also thought to have influenced their work. Timothy Aaron Pevey has argued that they crafted \"an immigrant figure whose desire was to fit into American culture as an American\", something which Pevey feels taps into an important aspect of American identity.\n\nWhen \"Superman\" first appeared, Superman's alter ego Clark Kent worked for the \"Daily Star\" newspaper, named by Shuster after the \"Toronto Daily Star\", his old employer in Toronto. Shuster said he modeled the cityscape of Superman's home city, Metropolis, on that of his old hometown. When the comic strip received international distribution, the company permanently changed the name to the \"Daily Planet\".\n\nIn 1946, near the end of their 10-year contract to produce Superman stories, Siegel and Shuster sued Detective Comics, Inc. to have their contract annulled and regain their rights to Superman. The following year, the New York State Supreme Court ruled the publisher had validly purchased the rights to Superman when it bought the first Superman story, saying the duo had \"transferred to Detective Comics, Inc., all of their rights in and to the comic strip Superman, including the title, names, characters and conception. ... \" A subsequent interlocutory judgment found that rights to Superboy, however, belonged to Siegel. Detective Comics Inc. subsequently paid Siegel and Shuster $94,000 for the rights to Superboy and the duo's written agreement acknowledging the rights to Superman belonged to the publisher. Afterward, the company removed Shuster and Siegel's byline from Superman stories.\n\nIn 1947, the team rejoined editor Sullivan, by then the founder and publisher of the comic-book company Magazine Enterprises where they created the short-lived comical crime-fighter Funnyman. Shuster continued to draw comics after the failure of \"Funnyman\", although exactly what he drew is uncertain. Comic historian Ted White wrote that Shuster continued to draw horror stories into the 1950s. In 2009, comics historian Craig Yoe said Shuster was the anonymous illustrator for \"Nights of Horror\", an underground sadomasochistic fetish paperback book series. This was based on character similarities, and comparison of the artistic style between the illustrations and those of the cast of the Superman comics.\n\nIn 1964, when Shuster was living on Long Island with his elderly mother, he was reported to be earning his living as a freelance cartoonist; he was also \"trying to paint pop art – serious comic strips – and hope[d] eventually to promote a one-man show in some chic Manhattan gallery\". At one point, his worsening eyesight prevented him from drawing, and he worked as a deliveryman in order to earn a living. Jerry Robinson claimed Shuster had delivered a package to the DC building, embarrassing the employees. He was summoned to the CEO, given one hundred dollars, and told to buy a new coat and find another job. By 1976, Shuster was almost blind and living in a California nursing home.\n\nIn 1967, when the Superman copyright came up for renewal, Siegel launched a second lawsuit, which also proved unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1975, Siegel launched a publicity campaign, in which Shuster participated, protesting DC Comics' treatment of him and Shuster.\nThe Association of American Editorial Cartoonists president, Jerry Robinson was involved in the campaign along with comic-book artist Neal Adams. In the face of a great deal of negative publicity over their handling of the affair (and due to the upcoming Superman movie), DC's parent company Warner Communications reinstated the byline dropped more than thirty years earlier and granted the pair a lifetime pension of $20,000 a year, later increased to $30,000, plus health benefits. The first issue with the restored credit was \"Superman\" #302 (Aug. 1976).\n\nAlthough Shuster was now supported by a lifetime stipend from DC Comics, he fell into debt – close to $20,000 by the time of his death. After he died, DC Comics agreed to pay off his unpaid debts in exchange for an agreement from his heirs to not challenge ownership over Superman.\n\nShuster died July 30, 1992 at his West Los Angeles home of congestive heart failure and hypertension. He was 78.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The character was introduced as a \"home-wrecking blonde\" by executive producer Matthew Robinson on 7 December 1998. Show scriptwriters and BBC controller of drama, Mal Young, doubted Benjamin's casting in the role. Lisa is characterised as \"a loyal, romantic Earth Mother\" who is \"feisty, independent and ambitious\". However, after a volatile relationship with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Lisa became an \"eternal victim\". The characters became instrumental in one of \"EastEnders\" most highly publicised and anticipated storylines, dubbed Who Shot Phil? in 2001, where an unknown assailant guns down Phil. An estimated 22 million viewers watched Lisa confess to Phil's attempted murder, causing the third-largest power surge on record.\n\nLisa became pregnant with Phil's child although opted not to tell him and claimed that her partner, Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), is the father. Lisa gives birth to Louise Fowler (Rachel Cox, Brittany Papple, Tilly Keeper) and in the show's Christmas 2001 episodes, Louise's parentage is revealed. Benjamin was written out of the serial in 2002 by executive producer Louise Berridge and Lisa departed in October 2002. Berridge later reintroduced the character on two occasions in 2003. Despite several reports stating she would return, Benjamin did not reprise the role until 2010 when Bryan Kirkwood brought the character back for a single episode on 5 August 2010. The actress reprised the role again in 2017 for a brief stint, returning on 21 July 2017 and departing on 3 August 2017.\n\nLisa makes friends with Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite) and moves in with Mark Fowler (Todd Carty). Although Mark has feelings for her, Lisa does not notice, having a fling with Gianni di Marco (Marc Bannerman) and a relationship with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), resulting in Lisa's pregnancy. Phil asks her to have an abortion but she refuses so he asks her to move in after coming round to the idea but she miscarries and blames Phil. Lisa loses her job when Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) reports her for being absent, so she becomes dependent on Phil. He is happy with the situation but she loses her confidence and becomes jealous of Phil's former wife, Kathy Mitchell (Gillian Taylforth) and son Ben Mitchell (Morgan Whittle), hiding letters and a video from them. This irritates Phil and he has sex with Mel when she is upset, following a fight with Lisa on Christmas Day. Regretting this, Mel agrees not to tell Lisa but does when Lisa says she intends to get pregnant again. Devastated, Lisa ends her relationship with Phil and moves in with Mark but she is already pregnant. She keeps this secret as Phil keeps belittling her, and on Mel and Steve Owen's (Martin Kemp) wedding night, Phil says that he never loved her and suggests Mel give her tips in the bedroom. In revenge, Lisa steals a gun from the e20 nightclub and shoots Phil. He survives and confronts her after leaving hospital but realises that he drove her to it and frames his enemy Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) instead. Wanting to keep Phil away from her child, Lisa and Mark marry, claiming that he is the baby's father. Everyone believes it and their romance becomes real. Lisa gives birth to baby Louise, and Lisa tells Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), that Phil is Louise's father. Sharon, however, tells Phil that Louise is his daughter and he forces them to accept he will be part of Louise's life. Despite initial animosity, when Lisa sees Phil with Louise, old feelings resurface and they eventually reconcile. However, Phil wants Louise, not Lisa, and when she realises, she and Louise emigrate to Portugal. Phil finds her and brings Louise home after blackmailing Lisa about shooting him and making her think she is unstable and an unfit mother. Phil leaves her standing on the edge of a cliff, and she is presumed dead. On Phil's wedding day to Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny), Lisa returns to reclaim her daughter. He is difficult, leading her to plan to shoot him again but Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) persuades her to let him do it. He and his son, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), frame Phil for armed robbery and Lisa reclaims custody when he is imprisoned. She leaves the Square with Louise.\n\nSeveral years later, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), a formerpoliceman, tells Phil that Lisa and Louise are living in South East London. After seeing Louise call another man \"daddy\", Phil decides that she is better off with Lisa. Two years later, Louise arrives alone in Walford, saying that Lisa has gone on holiday but not returned. Louise is taken into care but when Phil discovers this, he has a DNA test to prove Louise is his daughter and gains custody of her. Later that year, Phil is visited by a social worker, Derek Evans (Simon Lowe), who says that Lisa has made an application to see Louise. Phil does not want Lisa to have contact with Louise, but Phil's mother Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) takes her to see Lisa on Louise's request. Peggy slaps Lisa for abandoning her daughter, and Lisa reveals she had a breakdown and thought Louise might be better off without her, but the neighbour she left Louise with promised to look after her. Lisa worries that Phil might hurt Louise physically after Phil has hit Peggy. Peggy is unable to assure her that this will not happen. Peggy allows Louise to stay with Lisa permanently as long as Phil can visit her. Phil steals the social worker's bag to get Lisa's address, and drives there to confront her but finds the house abandoned and empty.\n\nSeven years later, Louise (now Tilly Keeper) is burnt by bullies Madison Drake (Seraphina Beh) and Alexandra D'Costa (Sydney Craven), and Lisa visits her in hospital. Lisa and Sharon argue but Sharon allows Lisa to stay. She tells Sharon that Louise wanted to live with Phil when she got a new boyfriend, which she admits was a relief. Lisa tells Phil she has had help with her life and has changed, but he ejects her from the hospital, telling her to stay away from Louise. She then stands up to Phil and he allows her to visit Louise. Lisa then starts talking strangely. She sees her therapist and lies that she has been doing fun things with Louise. Lisa takes keys to Phil's house and lets herself in, talking to and smashing photos, but cuts herself on glass. A doctor allows Lisa to take Louise outside of the hospital, but Lisa tells Louise she has been discharged, and takes her to a train station. Phil and Sharon inform the police that Louise is missing, and they trace Lisa through a cash withdrawal. Phil then discovers that Lisa has a mental health team. Lisa takes Louise to a hotel and prevents her from using the phone by cutting the cord, despite her being in agony. Louise realises that Lisa is not taking her medication. When Lisa allows Louise to go, she chooses to stay and comforts Lisa when she is distressed. Phil tracks them down but Lisa hits him over the head with a phone while Louise passes out. Sharon realises that Lisa's problems are all Phil's fault and Lisa tells Louise they will go to the hospital together. Later, Louise blames herself for Lisa's condition, telling Phil she left her knowing she was ill.\n\nThe character's arrival was announced by the press in November 1998. She was one of Executive Producer Matthew Robinson's introductions, and was described as a \"home-wrecking blonde\". According to actress Lucy Benjamin who played Lisa, the scriptwriters had doubts about casting her in the role: \"I just knew in my heart that I'd be able to do it well. And I desperately wanted the security of a regular income. But after the audition they kept me hanging on for such a long time. They tortured me by saying yes then saying no. It's the only job I've ever cried about when I thought I didn't have it.\" Benjamin said that she was overjoyed when she was eventually given the part. In 2010, Matthew Robinson discussed Lisa's introduction with \"Walford Web\", suggesting that Lisa and several other new characters introduced were an attempt to fill in character gaps in the soap resulting from a large number of axings. Lisa was conceptualised as a \"totty\" contingent. He indicated that the casting of Benjamin had been awkward as BBC controller of drama, Mal Young, was hesitant about her hiring. He eventually relented and, according to Robinson, admitted after seeing her in the role that \"she was, after all, a great asset to the show\".\n\nPrior to the 2000s, Lucy Benjamin described Lisa Shaw, as \"feisty, independent and ambitious\". Later she described her as \"a loyal, romantic Earth Mother\". It was revealed through dialogue on-screen that Lisa had nursed her mother through terminal cancer, and that she had not lost her virginity until the age of 28, when she came to Walford.\n\nThe character's demeanour altered somewhat circa 2000. Due to her romantic pairing with Phil Mitchell, she became \"mentally battered\". Rupert Smith, author of \"EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square\", classified the character as an \"eternal victim\": one who endures misfortune and misery, an endless sufferer. He adds, \"She was intelligent, beautiful and young — and so, of course, Lisa had to lie down and let men walk all over her [...] a snivelling, suicidal wreck.\" Benjamin has noted that her character was \"constantly crying\".\n\nLisa became more prominently featured in 1999 when she was paired romantically with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Phil and Lisa's relationship started in 1999. The relationship was scripted as problematic and included storylines about miscarriage, emotional and mental abuse, and infidelity when Phil slept with Lisa's best friend, Mel, (Tamzin Outhwaite).\n\nOne of \"EastEnders\"' most highly anticipated storylines involved the couple and has been dubbed \"Who Shot Phil?\". The plot saw Phil Mitchell gunned down outside his home in March 2001 in a \"Dallas\"-style whodunnit mystery. Various key characters were in the frame for the deed and viewers were left guessing for weeks as to which was the real culprit. Several outcomes were allegedly filmed and it was reported that only a few TV executives knew the identity of the would-be assassin — even the actors were kept in the dark. A spokesman commented, \"The cast are only getting their own scripts. They are not being told anyone else's storylines. Not even Phil knows who shot him. It's top secret.\" Script writers were reportedly given private security after a writer's laptop was stolen in what was believed to be an attempt to gain the identity of the assailant. The storyline captivated the public's imagination leading to thousands of bets being placed at the bookies across the UK — bookmaker William Hill said there was about 50,000 bets on who was responsible.\n\nAn estimated 22 million viewers watched \"EastEnders\" on 5 April 2001 to find out that Lisa — Phil's spurned ex-girlfriend — was the culprit. The episode caused the third-largest power surge on record and the Liverpool and Barcelona UEFA Cup semi-final was postponed for 15 minutes to accommodate a special 40 minute edition of the soap.\n\nLucy Benjamin told the \"Daily Star\" that keeping the secret that her character was responsible for the attempted murder had been the \"worst two months of her life\". She commented to \"The Mirror\", \"For two months I've carried this secret and it's been tough, really hard. I've had to lie to my colleagues — all the suspects were told to say it wasn't us. I've become very good at lying! The lies went on and on. The first person I told that it wasn't me was Todd Carty, who plays Mark [Fowler]. I thought he was a good chap to try my lies on to see if he believed it! And he did. I was delighted that it was me. I think Lisa had every reason to do it\". At the time, Lucy Benjamin expressed fear that the high-profile storyline would spell the end of her character, who she had thought would be imprisoned. However, in a further plot twist, Phil framed Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), for the shooting. Subsequent storylines involved in Lisa and Phil's narratives surrounded Lisa's pregnancy. In the storyline, Lisa, secretly expecting Phil's baby, married Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and claimed the baby was his. This secret was blown in the Christmas Day 2001 episodes.\n\nIn June 2002, it was reported that Lucy Benjamin had quit her role of Lisa. She commented, \"I’ve had a wonderful five years and I’m terribly excited by the [exit] storyline.” \"EastEnders\"' executive producer Louise Berridge added, “This is going to be a very demanding story to play but I know Lucy will do a fabulous job. She’s an actress with a terrific future.” Despite initial claims that the actress had decided to leave, she later admitted that the producers had axed the character. Discussing Lisa's exit, Lucy Benjamin's boyfriend of the time, actor Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell, said, \"Lucy didn’t feel comfortable with lying. There’s a stigma attached to being given the boot but she felt stupid pretending she’d decided to pack in a great job. It was hard for her and she was very upset but she’s come through it. I felt for her but soaps are led by storylines and Lucy was told that the writers had come up with a brilliant plot that was too good to say no to.I guess Lucy’s character was so central to the plot that eventually it blew up in her face. I’m proud of the fact that she was good enough to come to the forefront of the show. Lucy did so well to make her mark on \"EastEnders\" in the first place because Lisa arrived on the Square on her own. She wasn’t part of a family, which means she was more vulnerable to the chop. She was only on a three-month contract but she made it a success and ended up being part of the cast for four years. If you are part of a screen family on \"EastEnders\" you are practically bomb-proof, no matter what your ability is as an actor.\"\n\nLisa's departing storyline revolved around rekindling of her romance with Phil. After beginning an affair, she left Mark taking her daughter to live with the Mitchells. Benjamin discussed her character's motive: \"There has always been a spark between her and Phil and it’s never been put out. Lisa has tried to love Mark and in her own way, she does — but it’s not passionate between them. She knows it’s wrong. She chose Mark, but Phil is her weakness. She wants him, and there’s nothing she can do about it. Phil knows she loves the danger and for once, Lisa’s being impulsive. She’s a wife and mother and, although she loves her daughter and doesn’t want to hurt Mark, being with Phil is an escape. It gives her something she doesn’t have with Mark — passion. You’d think she’d learn not to get involved again. But Lisa is a victim of her love for Phil. It led her astray last time, and it’s happening again. She’s playing with fire, but it’s exciting.” Explaining his interpretation of Phil's motive, Steve McFadden added, \"He likes the new, spirited Lisa. She’s very different from the girl who let him walk all over her. She was just living to please him and he didn’t like that [...] Lisa isn’t the woman she used to be. She fought to keep her family together. She stood up to Phil. She even shot him! He wants a family, and he’s also attracted to her.”\n\nHowever, in the storyline, Lisa realised she had made a mistake when Phil and his family began excluding her from her daughter's life; she absconded with the baby in October 2002. In a subsequent plot, Phil retrieved his daughter off-screen, chasing Lisa to Portugal; returning with Lisa and Louise's passport, prompting a storyline that suggested to viewers that Phil had killed Lisa.\n\nIn January 2003, the BBC announced that Lucy Benjamin would reprise the role of Lisa for a special set of episodes that revealed Lisa's fate in flashbacks. The episodes were filmed on-location in and around Albufeira on the Portuguese Algarve. It was claimed that several endings to the episodes had been filmed and that the outcome was a \"closely guarded secret\". Despite initial claims that Lisa would be killed off in the episodes, this did not occur; instead, Lisa gave Phil custody of Louise after he convinced her she was unstable and threatened to tell the police that she had once shot him if she returned to England.\n\nHowever, in June 2003, it was confirmed that Lisa would once again be returning to the serial. Benjamin said, \"I couldn't believe it when I got the call a few months ago to ask if I would return to Walford. I didn't think Lisa would give up baby Lou without one last fight.\" The return storyline was temporary, allowing Lisa to usurp Phil and once again take custody of her daughter, with the help of Den Watts. The character then disappeared, exiting in November 2003.\n\nSince this exit, numerous press reports have suggested that the character would be returning to the serial again; these turned out to be false, with an \"EastEnders\" spokesperson saying in 2006 and 2007 that there were no current plans to bring the character back.\n\nWhen asked if she would return in 2004, Benjamin said, \"I loved Lisa. She was a great character and I loved playing all those story lines. It was a wonderful opportunity for me but all that angst and that drama can sometimes get to you. She hasn't been killed off. Loads of characters are revived and brought back but I don't know if it's something I'd want to do again at the moment. It still feels like only yesterday I was there and it's good to kind of recharge your batteries and get out there and do other things. But I love the show and I’d never say never! And I liked playing Lisa. I thought she was a great character so you just don’t know.\"\nIn April 2010, it was reported that Lisa would return for a single episode later in the year in a bid to retrieve Louise from Phil, who gained custody of her earlier in the year. Benjamin said of her return: \"I'm really looking forward to returning to \"EastEnders\" for this episode. It will be great to see some familiar faces and work alongside old friends again.\" Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood commented \"Lucy's character Lisa was responsible for one of the biggest cliffhanger episodes in \"EastEnders\", so it's a real treat to have her back on screen,\" while a spokesperson for the show added \"Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life – she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't be happy about him looking after his daughter. With their history, you know that this storyline is going to be an explosive episode in the Mitchells' history.\" The episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010. Discussing her brief return, Benjamin said, \"What I liked about doing this storyline was that it did explain where Lisa had been. When I was watching it, I was thinking 'Where's her mother? Where is Lisa? It's just ridiculous'. But it does make sense. She is mentally unstable and she does have times like that and the little girl is old enough to make her own decisions and say, 'I want to live with my dad now'. So she had to let her go. I liked that I was able to come back and defend myself because Lisa was kind of being slaughtered in the Square for being a rubbish mum!\"\n\nIt was reported on 20 July 2017 that Benjamin had reprised the role for a \"surprise\" appearance and is expected to be onscreen until August. Lisa returns to care for Louise after she is seriously injured, arriving at the hospital in the closing moments of the episode. McFadden will also return to the serial in the episodes following Lisa's return and a show insider commented, \"When that hospital door starts to open, [the audience will] be on tenterhooks to see who has rushed to help Louise. When it turns out to be Lisa, rather than Phil, there will be gasps of shock. It’s such a brilliant surprise.\" The show released no official confirmation on the reports, although Lisa returned in the episode broadcast in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017. It was subsequently confirmed that Lisa would be returning for a \"brief stint\" and would share scenes with Phil following his return. On her return, Benjamin commented, \"It was great to be back at EastEnders as it has been such a long time since I had been there. I loved being back in Elstree for the few weeks I was there, seeing old friends again and working with really talented people. I loved every minute of it.\"\n\nBenjamin's agent was approached by the show with a potential return for Lisa, which intrigued Benjamin, who had reservations about returning, as she felt the character was \"a chapter that was closed\". Benjamin was later contacted personally by Liza Mellody, the show's story producer, who explained a possible storyline that appealed to Benjamin. She found the storyline \"too good an offer to refuse\" and agreed to the return, safe in the knowledge that \"it was absolutely worth coming back for\". The actress struggled to keep her return a secret and only informed her mother and husband. She called the secret \"all very cloak and dagger\" at the studios and revealed that she was told to enter through a separate entrance and wear oversized sunglasses. On show scripts, Lisa's lines were listed under the character 'Sam' and, whenever Benjamin was filming, monitors that relay what is being filmed to sets are switched off.\n\nBenjamin felt \"a little apprehensive\" on her first day back filming with the serial, but settled back in after 20 minutes and enjoyed working with McFadden, Letitia Dean (Sharon Mitchell), Natalie Cassidy (Sonia Fowler), and Dean Gaffney (Robbie Jackson) again, which compared to \"being with old friends\". She teased \"great\" scenes between Lisa and Sharon, Phil and Sonia, opining that it is \"reminiscent of historical stuff\". The actress also stated that she missed the workload associated with filming the serial and commented, \"It was great to get my teeth back into doing what I do, really.\" Benjamin developed \"a really lovely connection\" with Tilly Keeper, who portrays Louise Mitchell, and found her \"marvellous\" to work with, calling her a \"professional\". They had never met before working together on \"EastEnders\". The actress hoped her return has \"a great impact\" as she felt a \"sense of responsibility\" with portraying the storyline. She called the storyline dramatic and explained, \"you'll see a lot of old Lisa being played out\".\n\nBenjamin explained the reasons for Lisa's return and she is back because Sonia contacted her, who \"feels Louise needs her [Lisa] to be there\" and Louise asks for Lisa in \"a state of upset\" where \"she’s a bit delirious\". This allows Lisa the \"choice about whether or not she wants to be involved.\" Lisa will not get \"a great reception\", believing that Lisa has \"been a bad mum\", but defended Lisa \"not being there for Louise\" as she \"hasn't been informed about what's going on [...] and if things were going terribly wrong she'd know about it.\" Lisa has been absent from Louise's life due to \"her own personal issues\" and Lisa \"thinks it’s in Louise’s best interest to have stayed away.\" Sharon will not \"be particularly keen to see her for her own reasons\" and Lisa staying away is seen as the best for Phil and his side of the family.\n\nBenjamin said when it comes to Lisa and Phil, \"there's always going to be drama [...] there's going to be fireworks\" as Phil \"isn't Lisa’s favourite person\" and \"in true Lisa and Phil fashion, it will be quite explosive.\" Lisa sees Phil as the person that \"triggers episodes of things going wrong for her\" and the one who has \"caused all of the problems going on her life\", caused by him taking Louise away from her, that leads to her wariness around him as she knows \"what he’s capable of doing.\" Benjamin believes Lisa and Phil will never \"be the best of friends or see eye-to-eye\", but Louise should be the person they put first and be adults for. Lisa sees Sharon as \"the right woman for Phil\" and regards her as \"lovely\", so she needs Sharon as an \"ally\" in order to help her relationship with Louise, but knows Sharon is \"no fool\", who \"will stand her ground.\" Benjamin added Lisa \"feels very guilty\" about leaving Louise and being excluded from her life, but her \"driving force is her unconditional love for her child\", but has \"hard times ahead with Louise, explaining why she hasn’t been there. I think she just hopes her daughter will need her and see she’s better off having her mum in her life.\"\n\nIn 2002, a survey done by Whitaker's revealed that 11% of British people questioned could not name a single world leader, but nearly half could list five characters in \"EastEnders\". Most named was Phil Mitchell (44%), followed by Mark Fowler (40%), Pauline Fowler (30%), Peggy Mitchell (28%) and Lisa Fowler (24%).\n\nTelevision critic for the \"Daily Mirror\", Ian Hyland, has described Lisa as miserable, suggesting in 2002 that she was \"red-hot favourite to take over [Pauline Fowler's] misery mantle.\" Jamie McCallum from \"The Guardian\" mocked the character in 2000 and her relationship with Phil, stating, \"We should, however, pay tribute to Lisa. This was the latest in a string of gripping dilemmas, including Should I Date Phil?, Should I Shag Phil? and Should I Give Birth To A Descendant Of Phil? For one who spends so much time deliberating, that girl makes a lot of duff decisions.\"\n"}

The Lower Germanic Limes separated that part of the Rhineland left of the Rhine as well as the Netherlands, which was part of the Roman Empire, from the less tightly controlled regions east of the Rhine.\n\nThe route of the \"limes\" started near the estuary of the Oude Rijn on the North Sea. It then followed the course of the Rhine and ended at the Vinxtbach in present-day Niederbreisig, a quarter in the town of Bad Breisig, the border with the province of Germania superior. The Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes then started on the opposite, right-hand, side of the Rhine with the Roman camp of Rheinbrohl.\n\nThe Lower Germanic Limes was not a fortified \"limes\" with ramparts, ditches, palisades or walls and watchtowers, but a river border (Lat.: \"ripa\"), similary to the \"limites\" on the Danube and Euphrates.\nThe Rhine Line was guarded by a chain of castra for auxiliary troops. It was laid out partly by Augustus and his stepson and military commander, Drusus, who began to strengthen the natural boundary of the Rhine from the year 15 A. D. The decision not to conquer the regions east of the Rhine in 16 A. D. made the Rhine into a fixed frontier of the Roman Empire. For its protection, a large number of estates (villae rusticae) and settlements (vici) were established. The names and locations of several sites have been handed down, mainly through the ‘’Tabula Peutingeriana and Itinerarium Antonini.\n\nTogether with the Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes, the Lower Germanic Limes forms part of the \"Limes Germanicus\"\n\nAs it runs along the Rhine the Lower Germanic Limes passes four landscapes with different topography and natural character. The southernmost and smallest portion, between the Vinxtbach and the area around Bonn still belongs to the Rhenish Massif, through which the river passes in a relatively narrow valley between the heights of the Westerwald and the Eifel Mountains. From roughly the area of Bonn, the Rhine valley opens into the Cologne Bay, which is bounded by the Bergisches Land, which hugs the river on the right-hand side, and the Eifel and High Fens to the southeast and east. The Cologne Bay has fertile loess soils and is characterized by a very mild climate. It is therefore little wonder that most of the rural \"vici\" and \"villae rusticae\" (farm estates) in Lower Germania were established in this area in Roman times. In the vicinity of the military camp of Novaesium, the Cologne Bay expands further into the Lower Rhine Plain, a river terrace landscape. Only a little west of today's German-Dutch border, roughly in the area of the legion camp of Noviomagus, the Lower Rhine Plain transitions into the watery marshland formed by the Rhine and Meuse and which finally ends at the North Sea in the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "323149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=323149", "title": "Matter of Rome", "text": "Matter of Rome\n\nAccording to the medieval poet Jean Bodel, the Matter of Rome was the literary cycle made up of Greek and Roman mythology, together with episodes from the history of classical antiquity, focusing on military heroes like Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. Bodel divided all the literary cycles he knew best into the Matter of Britain, the Matter of France and the Matter of Rome (although \"non-cyclical\" romance also existed). The Matter of Rome also included what is referred to as the Matter of Troy, consisting of romances and other texts based on the Trojan War and its after-effects, including the adventures of Aeneas.\n\nClassical topics were the subjects of a good deal of Old French literature, which in the case of Trojan subject matter ultimately deriving from Homer was built on scant sources; since the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" were unknown, medieval Western poets had to make do with two short prose narratives based on Homer, ascribed to Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius. The paucity of original text did not prevent the 12th century Norman poet Benoît de Sainte-Maure from writing a lengthy adaptation, \"Le Roman de Troie\", running 40,000 lines. The poems that were written on these topics were called the \"romans d'antiquité\", the \"romances of antiquity.\" This name presages the anachronistic approach the medieval poets used in dealing with these subjects. For example, in the epic poems \"Roman d'Alixandre\" and the \"Roman de Troie\", Alexander the Great, and Achilles and his fellow heroes of the Trojan War were treated as knights of chivalry, not much different from the heroes of the \"chansons de geste\". Elements of courtly love were introduced into the poems; in the \"Roman de Thèbes\", a romantic relationship absent from the Greek sources is introduced into the tale of Parthenopæus and Antigone. Military episodes in these tales were also multiplied, and used to introduce scenes of knight-errantry and tournaments. \n\nAnother example of French medieval poetry in this genre is the \"Eneas\", a treatment of the \"Aeneid\" that comes across as being a sort of burlesque of Virgil's poem. Sentimental and fantasy elements in the source material were multiplied, and incidents from Ovid, the most popular Latin poet of the Middle Ages, were mixed into the pastiche. The \"Philomela\" attributed to Chrétien de Troyes, a retelling of the story of Philomela and Procne, also takes its source from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\".\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer's \"Troilus and Criseyde\" is an English example, with Chaucer adding many elements to emphasize its connection with the matter. He also brought the story into line with the precepts of courtly love.\n\nThis anachronistic treatment of elements from Greek mythology is similar to that of the Middle English narrative poem \"Sir Orfeo\", where the Greek Orpheus becomes the knight Sir Orfeo who rescues his wife Heurodis (i.e. Eurydice) from the fairy king.\n\n"}
{"id": "22317868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22317868", "title": "Medieval stained glass", "text": "Medieval stained glass\n\nMedieval stained glass is the coloured and painted glass of medieval Europe from the 10th century to the 16th century. For much of this period stained glass windows were the major pictorial art form, particularly in northern France, Germany and England, where windows tended to be larger than in southern Europe (in Italy, for example, frescos were more common).\n\nStained glass windows were used predominantly in churches, but were also found in wealthy domestic settings and public buildings such as town halls, though surviving examples of secular glass are very rare indeed. The purpose of stained glass windows in a church was both to enhance the beauty of their setting and to inform the viewer through narrative or symbolism. The subject matter was generally religious in churches, though \"portraits\" and heraldry are often included, and many narrative scenes give valuable insights into the medieval world. \n\nWindow glass was in use from at least the 1st century AD and colored and painted window glass for use in religious buildings was also manufactured at an early date. The earliest extant example of ecclesiastical stained glass is possibly that from San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy. A clear glass roundel with a depiction of Christ in Majesty, thought to be the 6th century, was discovered here.\n\nSome of the earliest known examples of colored window glass, datable to c. 800–820, were recovered in excavations at the Abbey of San Vicenzo in Volturno, Italy. Glass of the same colour ranges and similar date is also found in England, at the monastic sites of Jarrow and Monkwearmouth, and at other sites in the north of England. These examples are not painted. However, it was not until the advent of the monumental cathedral and church building campaigns in the 11th and 12th centuries that the demand for colored glass began to increase significantly, reaching its highest level in the 14th and 15th centuries. The oldest surviving stained glass windows still \"in situ\" are thought to be the Prophet Windows in Augsburg Cathedral, of c. 1065.\n\nA useful 12th-century source on medieval glass manufacture is the \"De Divers Artibus\" of Theophilus Presbyter. Theophilus was a Benedictine Monk, believed by some scholars to be Roger of Helmarshausen, a metal glass and pigment worker who practiced in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. \"De Divers Artibus\" describes a number of craft processes including glassmaking and glassworking.\n\nIn the 9th century, CE or earlier (books 1 and 2 of a 3-vol Mss. completed by another in the 12th, Eraclius, in \"De coloribus et artibus Romanorum\", also gives an account of methods for producing colored glass, although he may have copied much of his text from the \"Naturalis Historia\" of Pliny the Elder of c. 77AD. Now considered 'Inaccurate' date on works of Eraclius Later in the medieval period the son of Anthony of Pisa, artist and instructor Cennino Cennini, and, in 1556, Georgius Agricola also contributed texts with aspects of glassmaking and glassworking.\n\nPrior to c. 1000, most coloured glass was of a soda-lime-silica composition. In Northern Europe soda glass was eventually almost totally superseded by potash-lime-silica glass (Forest glass). Forest glass continued to be used in stained glass for the duration of the medieval period until soda glass again began to be used in the 16th century.\n\nThe potash (KO) found in Forest Glass was derived from wood ash. In \"De Divers Artibus\", Theophilus describes the use of beech wood as the preferred source of ash. Other plant matter, such as bracken, was also used. As well as containing potash, beech ash comprises an assortment of compounds including iron and manganese oxides, which are particularly important for generating colour in glass.\n\nMedieval stained glass panels could be created either by the cylinder blown sheet or crown glass (window) method.\n\nForest glass was manufactured in Burgundy and Lorraine near the Rhein; in Flanders; and in Normandy, in the Seine and Loire Valleys. It was distributed throughout mainland north-west Europe and Britain in the form of ready-made sheets. The application of painted decoration to and final shaping of the sheets was carried out at glass working centres close by the final destination of the glass.\n\nThe colour of glass could be affected by many factors. Sources of silica were often impure, with iron oxide being one of the most common impurities. The greenish hue of uncoloured glass is usually owing to the presence of a mixture of ferrous (Fe) and ferric (Fe) ions in the glass matrix. It is also possible that ‘impurities’ could be introduced at the fritting stage within the glass furnace, leading to the addition of further alumina, silica and iron oxides.\n\nInherent colour refers to the colours that may be formed in the molten glass by manipulating the furnace environment. Theophilus describes molten glass changing to a ‘saffron yellow colour’ which will eventually transform to a reddish yellow on further heating, he also refers to a ‘tawny colour, like flesh’ which, upon further heating will become ‘a light purple’ and later ‘a reddish purple, and exquisite’.\n\nThese colour changes are the result of the behaviour, under redox conditions, of the iron and manganese oxides which are naturally present in beech wood ash.\n\nIn the glass melt the iron and manganese behave as follows:\n\nIn an oxidising environment metal (and some non-metal) ions will lose electrons. In iron oxides, Fe (ferrous) ions will become Fe (ferric) ions. In molten glass this will result in a change in glass colour from pale blue to yellow/brown. In a reducing environment the iron will gain electrons and colour will change from yellow/brown to pale blue. Similarly manganese will change in colour depending on its oxidation state. The lower oxidation state of manganese (Mn) is yellow in common glass while the higher oxidation states (Mn or higher) is purple. A combination of the two states will give a pink glass.\n\nAs the manganese and iron may each be in different states of oxidation, the combination of the two can result in a broad range of attractive colours. Manganese in its fully oxidised state, if not present in too great a mass, will also act as a decolourant of glass if the iron is in its yellow, ferric form. The two colours in effect cancel each other out to produce a clear glass.\n\nExperimental manufacture of potash glass emulating Theophilus’ recipes has resulted in colours ranging from colourless to yellow, amber, brown, green, blue, pink and purple. Variation in colour hue and depth would also probably be affected by the source of the beech wood ash, depending on the soil chemistry where the beech tree grew, the age of the tree and the climate conditions.\nSome of the stronger reds, blues and greens that are a feature of medieval stained glass rely on the addition of copper oxides.\n\nEraclius’ \"De Coloribus et Artibus\" includes instructions for creating green and red glass by adding copper (probably in the form of ore or copper filings) to the batch, a method practiced since ancient times. (The chapters on how to make red, green and blue glass are missing from \"De Divers Artibus\".)\nAs with the iron/manganese colours, the colours formed by the addition of copper oxide to the glass are dependent on the different oxidation states of the added copper. In an oxidising environment blue cupric (Cu) ions are formed, in a strongly reducing environment red colloidal cuprous (Cu) oxide is formed and if reoxidised then green cuprous (Cu) oxide results.\n\nThe production of bright reds and blues in particular was straightforward, as the addition of copper to the mix resulted in the reliable creation of red, blue and green. The dominance of red and blue in Romanesque and Gothic glass is obvious. However, at York Minster, for example, it was demonstrated that 90% of the medieval glass was coloured by means of iron/manganese content.\n\nEarly medieval glass was soda-based, and although the use of soda glass in Northern Europe was almost wholly superseded by forest glass after c. 1000, there are some examples of a richly coloured blue glass (identified through XRF analysis) that was produced in the medieval period using soda as the alkali. In the UK, a considerable quantity of blue soda glass has been identified in stained glass from York Minster, and in excavations at Old Sarum and Winchester. In France, in Chartres Cathedral and St Denis in Paris, soda glass has also been found, and no doubt there must be many other examples.\n\nEvidence of recycling Roman tesserae to produce window glass in the 9th century has been identified at the Benedictine Monastery of San Vincenzo, Molise, Italy. Theophilus, in the 12th century, was also aware of such practice. He states that mosaic tesserae: ‘little square stones’ from ‘ancient pagan buildings’ along with ‘various small vessels in the same colours’ could be used to produce glass: ‘they even melt the blue in their furnaces, adding a little of the clear white to it, and they make from it blue glass sheets which are costly and very useful in windows.’ According to Theophilus, the French were particularly skilled at this process.\n\nCox suggests that the examples analysed at York could indeed be ‘Roman, or slightly later, glass re-melted in France and imported into England’.\n\nGlass comprising multiple layers of clear and (usually) red glass was known to exist in the 12th and 13th centuries. The manufacturing process is not known. Flashing was developed in the 15th century, and refers to the superimposition of a thin layer of coloured glass onto another coloured or uncoloured glass sheet. The procedure may have involved dipping a small sphere of molten glass into a molten uncoloured glass and blowing this into a cylinder form (the cylinder blown sheet process) which was then cut into sections and flattened in an annealing oven. Red, or ruby, copper-based glass, is usually flashed as the colour is too dense to be used alone. Other glass colours may also be flashed. These techniques could be remarkably sophisticated as demonstrated by 15thc. glass from the Carthusian Monastery of Pavia, where layered glasses of blue and violet; green and uncoloured; and red and uncoloured have been identified.\n\nThe paint applied to glass was a type of enamel, usually dark brown or black, formed from a mixture of: ground copper or iron oxide; powdered glass; wine, urine or vinegar; and gum arabic. other recipes could include sugar, treacle or vegetable oil. This ‘paint’ was applied in a series of washes, with fine details added last. Both the external and internal faces of the glass could be painted, adding depth to the overall composition. The enamel was fixed by ‘firing’ the glass in an annealing oven.\n\nProducing a strong clear yellow could be difficult in early stained glass as it relied upon the careful control of furnace conditions in order to create the appropriate reducing or oxidising environment. The introduction of silver stain in the early 14th century not only provided a solution to this difficulty, but also allowed greater flexibility in the way in which colour could be used. The first datable example of the use of silver stain is in the parish church of Le Mesnil-Villeman, Manche, France (1313). Silver stain was a combination of silver nitrate or silver sulphide blended with pipe clay and applied to (usually) clear glass. This technique enabled a more flexible approach to glass painting, allowing, for example, the hair of a figure to be painted on the same piece of glass as the head. It was also used to highlight details of canopywork or grisaille, and later it was added to the surface of coloured glass, to create a wider variety of glass hues.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56107334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56107334", "title": "No Peace Without Spain", "text": "No Peace Without Spain\n\nNo Peace Without Spain was a popular British political slogan of the early eighteenth century. It referred to the ongoing War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) which Britain was leading participant in. It implied that no peace treaty could be agreed with Britain's principal enemy Louis XIV of France that allowed Philip, the French candidate, to retain the Spanish crown. The term became a rallying cry for opposition to the Tory government of Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford and the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht.\n\nThe phrase was first popularly used by the Tory politician Lord Nottingham in Parliament in December 1711. However it was soon adopted by the rival Whig movement, who were increasingly regarded as the \"war party\" opposed to the \"peace party\" of the Tories. The Whigs were buoyed by the campaigns in the Low Countries where the British commander, the Duke of Marlborough, led the Allies to a series of victories. The Whigs demanded that King Louis be made to abandon his expansionist policies, and renounce any attempts to make Spain a satellite state.\n\nWhile the term originated in London, it also spread to several Allied capitals as a statement of intent. However, this represented an extension of the war aims the Allies had originally agreed upon, potentially extending the conflict.\n\n The intervention in Spain started well, with the capture of Gibraltar in 1704 and Barcelona in 1705 and securing the support of Portugal and the Catalans. However, it soon became clear the Bourbon candidate Philip V was far more popular in Castile than the Austrian Archduke Charles. The Allies were forced to evacuate Madrid in 1706 and soundly beaten at the Battle of Almanza in 1707.\n\nIn 1708 the new British commander James Stanhope took the island of Minorca, a possession of more use to the British than Charles' prospects of becoming King of Spain. Philip's forces recaptured Alicante in April 1709 and defeated an Anglo-Portuguese army at La Gudiña in May. The Portuguese now declared an informal truce, allowing trade and agriculture to recommence.\n\nA renewed Allied effort in 1710 led to victories at Almenar and Saragossa in July and August and the capture of Madrid in September. However, lack of support from the local population meant Charles entered an almost deserted city and the Allies were effectively isolated when Portuguese forces were prevented from crossing into Spain. In November, they left Madrid for Catalonia in two separate detachments, Stanhope's division of 5,000 and one of 12,000 under the Austrian Starhemberg. At Brihuega on 9 December 1710, Stanhope was taken by surprise and forced to surrender to an army led by Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme. Vendôme followed this up the next day by defeating Starhemberg at Villaviciosa; these defeats were a devastating setback to Allied ambitions in Spain.\n\nIn April 1711, Emperor Joseph I died and his brother Archduke Charles succeeded him as the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI; an Austrian union with Spain was as unwelcome to Britain as a French one, which meant there seemed little point in continuing the war.\n\nA new Tory Government, led by Robert Harley, came to power in 1710. Committed to ending Britain's involvement in the European War, which had been costly in lives and money, they took steps to disengage. This eventually resulted in the dismissal of hawkish Marlborough, who was replaced by the Irish Tory commander Duke of Ormonde.\n\nAn increasingly struggling France was eager to discuss terms. A major stumbling block had been an earlier demand that Louis XIV assist, by force if necessary, to drive his own grandson from the throne of Spain. After lengthy negotiations an agreement was established, which included a compromise peace in Spain. This allowed Philip to keep the throne, while granting Britain possession of Gibraltar and Minorca. Britain then withdrew from the war effort in both Flanders and Spain.\n\nThe terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, were bitterly contested by the Whigs once they became clear. Jonathan Swift's \"The Conduct of the Allies\" was published as a defence of the Tory government. The celebrated Hamilton-Mohun Duel was fought between Lord Mohun, a Whig partisan, and the Duke of Hamilton who had just been appointed Ambassador to France. Tories portrayed the duel, in which both men were killed, as a Whig plot to derail the peace agreement.\n\nWhigs remained furious about what they regarded as the abandonment of Spain. The slogan became a popular rallying cry against the Treaty, and the Tory government in general. Nonetheless Parliament voted in favour of the Utrecht terms.\n\nStill using the slogan of \"No Peace Without Spain\", Britain's former allies such as the Austria and the Dutch Republic tried to fight on, but suffered defeats without the financial and military support previously provided by London. The Allies reluctantly agreed terms with France. While these represented a successful outcome of the war, they were less than had been hoped for a few years before.\n\nPhilip was acknowledged as King of Spain, but was forced to give up significant territories to the Emperor in Austria. The Allies then withdrew their last forces from the Iberian Peninsular. The final fighting in Spain took place when the remaining anti-French stronghold Barcelona fell after a lengthy siege.\n\nIn 1714 George I the ruler of Hanover, one of the Allies who had opposed the withdrawal from Spain, succeeded to the British throne. George dismissed the Tories who had pushed through the compromise peace. He rewarded the opponents of Utrecht with places in government. These were mostly Whigs, although the new cabinet included the Tory Nottingham who had originally moved the \"No Peace Without Spain\" amendement. Marlborough was reinstalled as head of the Army with William Cadogan as his deputy. General Stanhope, a Whig, who had commanded in Spain and vigorously opposed the peace became chief minister and the architecht of Britain's post-war foreign policy.\n\nHowever, in an ironic turn of events, Britain soon agreed an Alliance with France. Before long the two countries were fighting together against a revived Spain under Philip, who was trying to overturn the Treaty of Utrecht and recover lost territories abroad. This war ended in defeat for Spain, although Philip kept his throne. Tories used this as evidence of the success of their policy. However, some younger Patriot Whigs such as William Pitt saw the compromise peace as leading to the later Franco-Spanish Alliance which caused Britain many problems throughout the 18th century.\n\nDespite the prominence at the time the \"No Peace Without Spain\" debate, the war in the Iberian Peninsular has largely been neglected by historians who have chosen to focus on Marlborough's Flanders campaigns.\n\n"}

In the study of ancient writing, such as cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, \"register\" may be used of vertical compartments like columns containing writing that are arranged side by side and separated by lines, especially in cylinder seals, which often mix text and images. Normally, when dealing with images it only refers to row compartments stacked vertically. \n\nAmong many other cultures, the use of registers is common in Ancient Egyptian art, from the Narmer Palette onwards, and in medieval art in large frescos and illuminated manuscripts. Narrative art, especially covering the lives of sacred figures, is often presented as a sequence of small scenes arranged in registers. \n\nSculpted Luwian language hieroglyphs were also usually arranged in registers one above the other. The direction of reading ran from one of the top corners, and reversed direction in each lower register, so that the reader did not have to start at the other end of each new row.

{"id": "5300830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5300830", "title": "Standard illuminant", "text": "Standard illuminant\n\nA standard illuminant is a theoretical source of visible light with a profile (its spectral power distribution) which is published. Standard illuminants provide a basis for comparing images or colors recorded under different lighting.\n\nThe International Commission on Illumination (usually abbreviated CIE for its French name) is the body responsible for publishing all of the well-known standard illuminants. Each of these is known by a letter or by a letter-number combination.\n\nIlluminants A, B, and C were introduced in 1931, with the intention of respectively representing average incandescent light, direct sunlight, and average daylight. Illuminants D represent phases of daylight, Illuminant E is the equal-energy illuminant, while Illuminants F represent fluorescent lamps of various composition.\n\nThere are instructions on how to experimentally produce light sources (\"standard sources\") corresponding to the older illuminants. For the relatively newer ones (such as series D), experimenters are left to measure to profiles of their sources and compare them to the published spectra:\nNevertheless, they do provide a measure, called the Metamerism Index, to assess the quality of daylight simulators. The Metamerism Index tests how well five sets of metameric samples match under the test and reference illuminant. In a manner similar to the color rendering index, the average difference between the metamers is calculated.\n\nThe CIE defines illuminant A in these terms:\nThe spectral radiant exitance of a black body follows Planck's law:\n\nAt the time of standardizing illuminant A, both formula_2 (which does not affect the relative SPD) and formula_3 were different. In 1968, the estimate of c was revised from 0.01438 m·K to 0.014388 m·K (and before that, it was 0.01435 m·K when illuminant A was standardized). This difference shifted the Planckian locus, changing the color temperature of the illuminant from its nominal 2848 K to 2856 K:\n\nIn order to avoid further possible changes in the color temperature, the CIE now specifies the SPD directly, based on the original (1931) value of c:\n\nThe coefficients have been selected to achieve a normalized SPD of at . The tristimulus values are , and the chromaticity coordinates using the standard observer are .\n\nIlluminants B and C are easily achieved daylight simulations. They modify Illuminant A by using liquid filters. B served as a representative of noon sunlight, with a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4874 K, while C represented average day light with a CCT of 6774 K. Unfortunately, they are poor approximations of any phase of natural daylight, particularly in the short-wave visible and in the ultraviolet spectral ranges. Once more realistic simulations were achievable, Illuminants B & C were deprecated in favor of the D series:. Lighting cabinets, such as the Spectralight III, that use filtered incandescent lamps have better fits to the D illuminants in the to range than do the fluorescent daylight simulators. \n\nThe liquid filters, designed by Raymond Davis, Jr. and Kasson S. Gibson in 1931, have a relatively high absorbance at the red end of the spectrum, effectively increasing the CCT of the incandescent lamp to daylight levels. This is similar in function to a CTO color gel that photographers and cinematographers use today, albeit much less convenient.\n\nEach filter uses a pair of solutions, comprising specific amounts of distilled water, copper sulfate, mannite, pyridine, sulfuric acid, cobalt, and ammonium sulfate. The solutions are separated by a sheet of uncolored glass. The amounts of the ingredients are carefully chosen so that their combination yields a color temperature conversion filter; that is, the filtered light is still white.\n\nDerived by Judd, MacAdam, and Wyszecki, the D series of illuminants are constructed to represent natural daylight. They are difficult to produce artificially, but are easy to characterize mathematically.\n\nH. W. Budde of the National Research Council of Canada in Ottawa, H. R. Condit and F. Grum of the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, New York, and S. T. Henderson and D. Hodgkiss of Thorn Electrical Industries in Enfield had independently measured the spectral power distribution (SPD) of daylight from to , totaling among them 622 samples. Judd \"et al.\" analyzed these samples and found that the (\"x\", \"y\") chromaticity coordinates had a simple, quadratic relation:\n\nSimonds supervised the characteristic vector analysis of the SPDs. Application of his method revealed that the SPDs could be satisfactorily approximated by using the mean (S) and first two characteristic vectors (S and S):\n\nIn simpler terms, the SPD of the studied daylight samples can be expressed as the linear combination of three, fixed SPDs. The first vector (S) is the mean of all the SPD samples, which is the best reconstituted SPD that can be formed with only a fixed vector. The second vector (S) corresponds to yellow–blue variation, accounting for changes in the correlated color temperature due to presence or absence of clouds or direct sunlight. The third vector (S) corresponds to pink–green variation caused by the presence of water in the form of vapor and haze.\n\nTo construct a daylight simulator of a particular correlated color temperature one merely needs to know the coefficients M and M of the characteristic vectors S and S.\n\nExpressing the chromaticities x and y as:\nand making use of known tristimulus values for the mean vectors, they were able to express M and M as follows:\n\nThe only problem is that this left unsolved the computation of the coordinate formula_12 for a particular phase of daylight. Judd \"et al.\" simply tabulated the values of certain chromaticity coordinates, corresponding to commonly used correlated color temperatures, such as 5500 K, 6500 K, and 7500 K. For other color temperatures, one could consult figures made by Kelly. This problem was addressed in the CIE report that formalized illuminant D, with an approximation of the x coordinate in terms of the reciprocal color temperature, valid from 4000 K to 25,000 K. The y coordinate trivially followed from Judd's quadratic relation.\n\nJudd \"et al.\" then extended the reconstituted SPDs to – and – by using Moon's spectral absorbance data of the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe tabulated SPDs presented by the CIE today are derived by linear interpolation of the data set down to . \n\nSimilar studies have been undertaken in other parts of the world, or repeating Judd \"et al.\"'s analysis with modern computational methods. In several of these studies, the daylight locus is notably closer to the Planckian locus than in Judd \"et al.\"\n\nThe relative spectral power distribution (SPD) formula_13 of a D series illuminant can be derived from its chromaticity coordinates in the CIE 1931 color space, formula_14:\nwhere \"T\" is the illuminant's CCT. The chromaticity coordinates of the Illuminants D are said to form the \"CIE Daylight Locus\". The relative SPD is given by:\nwhere formula_21 are the mean and first two eigenvector SPDs, depicted above. The characteristic vectors both have a zero at , since all the relative SPDs have been normalized about this point.\n\nThe CCTs of the canonical illuminants, D, D, D, and D, differ slightly from what their names suggest. For example, D50 has a CCT of 5003 K (\"horizon\" light), while D65 has a CCT of 6504 K (noon light). As explained in a previous section, this is because the value of the constants in Planck's law have been slightly changed since the definition of these canonical illuminants, whose SPDs are based on the original values in Planck's law. In order to match all significant digits of the published data of the canonical illuminants the values of M and M have to be rounded to three decimal places before calculation of \"S.\"\n\nIlluminant E is an equal-energy radiator; it has a constant SPD inside the visible spectrum. It is useful as a theoretical reference; an illuminant that gives equal weight to all wavelengths, presenting an even color. It also has equal CIE XYZ tristimulus values, thus its chromaticity coordinates are (x,y)=(1/3,1/3). This is by design; the XYZ color matching functions are normalized such that their integrals over the visible spectrum are the same.\n\nIlluminant E is not a black body, so it does not have a color temperature, but it can be approximated by a D series illuminant with a CCT of 5455 K. (Of the canonical illuminants, D is the closest.) Manufacturers sometimes compare light sources against Illuminant E to calculate the excitation purity.\n\nThe F series of illuminants represent various types of fluorescent lighting.\n\nF1–F6 \"standard\" fluorescent lamps consist of two semi-broadband emissions of antimony and manganese activations in calcium halophosphate phosphor. F4 is of particular interest since it was used for calibrating the CIE color rendering index (the CRI formula was chosen such that F4 would have a CRI of 51). F7–F9 are \"broadband\" (full-spectrum light) fluorescent lamps with multiple phosphors, and higher CRIs. Finally, F10–F12 are narrow triband illuminants consisting of three \"narrowband\" emissions (caused by ternary compositions of rare-earth phosphors) in the R,G,B regions of the visible spectrum. The phosphor weights can be tuned to achieve the desired CCT.\n\nThe spectra of these illuminants are published in Publication 15:2004.\n\nPublication of an L series of illuminants is expected mid-2018. It will represent various types of LED lighting.\n\nThe spectrum of a standard illuminant, like any other profile of light, can be converted into tristimulus values. The set of three tristimulus coordinates of an illuminant is called a \"white point\". If the profile is normalized, then the white point can equivalently be expressed as a pair of chromaticity coordinates.\n\nIf an image is recorded in tristimulus coordinates (or in values which can be converted to and from them), then the white point of the illuminant used gives the maximum value of the tristimulus coordinates that will be recorded at any point in the image, in the absence of fluorescence. It is called the white point of the image.\n\nThe process of calculating the white point discards a great deal of information about the profile of the illuminant, and so although it is true that for every illuminant the exact white point can be calculated, it is not the case that knowing the white point of an image alone tells you a great deal about the illuminant that was used to record it.\n\n"}

The Duke of Cornwall and York (later H.M. King George V), May 9, 1901, more commonly known in Australia as The Big Picture, is a 1903 painting by the Australian artist Tom Roberts. The painting, measuring , or roughly 10 by 17 feet, depicts the opening of the first Parliament of Australia at the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne on 9 May 1901.\n\nThe painting is part of the Royal Collection but has been on permanent loan to the Parliament of Australia since 1957. The work, currently on display in Parliament House, Canberra, has been described as \"undoubtedly the principal work of art recording Australia's Parliamentary History.\"\n\nOn 1 January 1901, after years of debate, the various colonies in Australia joined in a federation. While the new Constitution of Australia called for a new capital to be constructed, away from the major cities, until that time Melbourne would act as the seat of government of the new nation. Elections were held for the first Parliament of Australia and on 9 May 1901, the new parliament was sworn in at the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne.\n\nThe opening of the new parliament was seen as a historic and momentous occasion with King Edward VII's son, the Duke of Cornwall and York (later George V) coming to Australia to officially open the new parliament on behalf of the King. To appropriately capture the occasion, the \"Australian Art Association\", a consortium of private benefactors, sought to commission a painting of the event as a \"gift to the nation\". Their motives were not entirely altruistic; the consortium hoped to profit by selling prints. Roberts was not the consortium's first choice, with J. C. Waite initially preferred.\n\nAlthough not commissioned on the day of the opening, Roberts had received an approach from the consortium and so attended the ceremony to take photographs and sketches. Two weeks after the event, after the consortium were turned down by Waite, Roberts was formally commissioned to produce the painting. The contract initially was for 650 guineas but this was increased to 1000 guineas when the scope of the work was realised. Roberts was also paid one guinea for each subject's sketch plus expenses; in all he received over 2000 guineas for the work. The contract required Roberts to include at least 250 recognisable likenesses in the finished work, including the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, the Governor General, each State Governor, Members of the new Commonwealth Parliament and other distinguished guests.\n\nRoberts started to work on the painting in a room provided at the Royal Exhibition Building. The painting was made in three flax panels to enable it to be folded for transportation. He travelled to Sydney and many other places to make sketches of the attendees as well as working from photographs. He asked his subjects for \"measurements\" to ensure accuracy—age, height, weight, hat size and even place of birth. In all, the picture included 269 separate portraits. Rumours spread that Roberts was paid by some of these dignitaries to ensure they were placed in a more prominent location. \n\nMost of the delegates at the ceremony wore black, still observing a period of mourning after the recent death of Queen Victoria. To balance this Roberts gave some emphasis to the choir, who were dressed in white. A shaft of light focused on the Duke reading the King's proclamation also provides some colour; this phenomenon was remarked upon by contemporary newspaper reports. Artistic licence was taken with the dais shown as much higher that it actually was and some other architectural features of the building either downplayed or ignored. Roberts also honoured the \"Father of Federation\", Henry Parkes, who had died five years previous. He added a portrait of Parkes in the form of a painting above the dais, this painting was not there on the day.\n\nRoberts took the painting to London—where many of the attendees lived—to complete, using the South African Room of the Imperial Institute as his workspace. The painting was finished on 16 November 1903; in all, it took Roberts two and a half years to complete. It was then taken to Paris where photogravure reproductions were made for sale to the public, with Roberts signing 500 of them. Roberts did not sign the actual painting.\n\nThe painting was first exhibited in the Royal Academy in London before being presented to King Edward VII by the Commonwealth Government in 1904. It was then moved to St. James's Palace where it remained on display until 1957. That year, Robert Menzies, the Prime Minister of Australia requested the permanent loan of the painting from Queen Elizabeth II. The Queen consented and the picture returned to Australia in 1958.\n\nThe picture was to be exhibited in the King's Hall of the then Parliament House with the other historic records of events as the opening of the first Parliament in Canberra in 1927 and the Royal opening of Parliament in 1954, however it was too big for the available space. The decision was made to store the painting at the Australian War Memorial after a tour of the various state galleries. In 1969, the painting was moved to the Parliament House basement where it remained until 1980.\n\nAs a result of its travels, the picture had deteriorated considerably and required major restoration work. The School of Materials Conservation at the Canberra College of Advanced Education started restoration work in 1980. The work included infra-red and ultra-violet photography to determine the condition of the painting followed by removal of old varnish and grime, repairs to the tacking margin and restoration of some small areas of paint. The work was completed in time for it to be taken to the new High Court of Australia building for its official opening by the Queen in 1981.\n\nThe designers of the new Parliament House were mindful of the need to provide an appropriate space to display \"The Big Picture\" in the new building. The Joint Standing Committee responsible for the new building made the decision to place the painting in the Main Committee Room Foyer. The architects worked to ensure that major design elements in the room such as the skylight and balustrade around the work allowed for the integration of the painting with the available space. Because the fragile state of the picture prevented it from being rolled, moving the painting from the High Court to Parliament House was a major logistical exercise. The move required removal of some windows at the High Court, the construction of a special carrying frame and scaffolding and a system of winches to support the picture in place. The painting remains in this specially designed location to this day.\n\nOn the occasion of the centenary of Federation in 2001, the Premier of Victoria Steve Bracks led a call for ownership of the painting to be formally transferred from the British Royal Collection to the Australian Crown. This was opposed as being both impracticable and unnecessary, as the Queen or her successors were unlikely to request its return.\n\nThe effort of creating such a monumental picture—Roberts nicknamed it \"The Big Picture\"—took its toll on the artist. Nicknamed \"Bulldog\", he drew a picture of a bulldog escaping a collar and chain in a letter he wrote informing that the picture was near completion. He described the painting once as his \"Frankenstein of 17 feet.\" Roberts's eyesight was weakened by the strain in representing so many likenesses accurately and the importance that he placed on the task sapped his strength. The biographer Humphrey McQueen claims the picture gave Roberts \"an inflated idea of [his] own importance\". However, Roberts never established himself as an artist in England and slipped into depression. The completion of the painting is generally seen as a turning point in his artistic career, after which his work never again reached the same heights. Roberts family reject this consensus as a \"myth\", with his great-granddaughter, artist Lisa Roberts, stating \"His son, my grandfather, Caleb, documented that for a year he was depressed which isn't surprising after a huge commission like that that took him away from the thing he loved most which was the landscape. But after that, he went back to it. He continued to paint but not with the desire to be rich and famous.\"\n\nThe work itself was considered a worthy record of the event but not a masterpiece. It has, however, become the best known pictorial record of the historic occasion, and a national icon. The cartoonist Bill Leak's homage, \"The big picture... with apologies to Tom Roberts\", won the 1997 Walkley Award for best artwork. Robert Hannaford was commissioned to create a companion piece to celebrate the centenary of Federation in 2001.\n\n"}

{"id": "37713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37713", "title": "The Merchant of Venice", "text": "The Merchant of Venice\n\nThe Merchant of Venice is a 16th-century play written by William Shakespeare in which a merchant in Venice (Antonio) must default on a large loan provided by a Jewish moneylender, Shylock. It is believed to have been written between 1596 and 1599. Though classified as a comedy in the First Folio and sharing certain aspects with Shakespeare's other romantic comedies, the play is most remembered for its dramatic scenes, and it is best known for Shylock and the famous \"Hath not a Jew eyes?\" speech on humanity. Also notable is Portia's speech about \"the quality of mercy\". Critic Harold Bloom listed it among Shakespeare's great comedies.\n\nBassanio, a young Venetian of noble rank, wishes to woo the beautiful and wealthy heiress Portia of Belmont. Having squandered his estate, he needs 3,000 ducats to subsidise his expenditures as a suitor. Bassanio approaches his friend Antonio, a wealthy merchant of Venice who has previously and repeatedly bailed him out. Antonio agrees, but since he is cash-poor – his ships and merchandise are busy at sea to Tripolis, the Indies, Mexico and England – he promises to cover a bond if Bassanio can find a lender, so Bassanio turns to the Jewish moneylender Shylock and names Antonio as the loan's guarantor.\n\nAntonio has already antagonized Shylock through his outspoken antisemitism and because Antonio's habit of lending money without interest forces Shylock to charge lower rates. Shylock is at first reluctant to grant the loan, citing abuse he has suffered at Antonio's hand. He finally agrees to lend the sum to Bassanio without interest upon one condition: if Antonio is unable to repay it at the specified date, Shylock may take a pound of Antonio's flesh. Bassanio does not want Antonio to accept such a risky condition; Antonio is surprised by what he sees as the moneylender's generosity (no \"usance\" – interest – is asked for), and he signs the contract. With money at hand, Bassanio leaves for Belmont with his friend Gratiano, who has asked to accompany him. Gratiano is a likeable young man, but he is often flippant, overly talkative, and tactless. Bassanio warns his companion to exercise self-control, and the two leave for Belmont.\n\nMeanwhile, in Belmont, Portia is awash with suitors. Her father left a will stipulating each of her suitors must choose correctly from one of three caskets – made of gold, silver and lead respectively. Whoever picks the right casket wins Portia's hand. The first suitor, the Prince of Morocco, chooses the gold casket, interpreting its slogan, \"Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire\", as referring to Portia. The second suitor, the conceited Prince of Arragon, chooses the silver casket, which proclaims, \"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves\", as he believes he is full of merit. Both suitors leave empty-handed, having rejected the lead casket because of the baseness of its material and the uninviting nature of its slogan, \"Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath\". The last suitor is Bassanio, whom Portia wishes to succeed, having met him before. As Bassanio ponders his choice, members of Portia's household sing a song that says that \"fancy\" (not true love) is \"engend'red in the eyes, / With gazing fed\"; Bassanio chooses the lead casket and wins Portia's hand.\nAt Venice, Antonio's ships are reported lost at sea, so the merchant cannot repay the bond. Shylock has become more determined to exact revenge from Christians because his daughter Jessica eloped with the Christian Lorenzo and converted. She took a substantial amount of Shylock's wealth with her, as well as a turquoise ring which Shylock had been given by his late wife, Leah. Shylock has Antonio brought before court.\n\nAt Belmont, Bassanio receives a letter telling him that Antonio has been unable to repay the loan from Shylock. Portia and Bassanio marry, as do Gratiano and Portia's handmaid Nerissa. Bassanio and Gratiano leave for Venice, with money from Portia, to save Antonio's life by offering the money to Shylock. Unknown to Bassanio and Gratiano, Portia sent her servant, Balthazar, to seek the counsel of Portia's cousin, Bellario, a lawyer, at Padua.\n\nThe climax of the play takes place in the court of the Duke of Venice. Shylock refuses Bassanio's offer of 6,000 ducats, twice the amount of the loan. He demands his pound of flesh from Antonio. The Duke, wishing to save Antonio but unable to nullify a contract, refers the case to a visitor. He identifies himself as Balthasar, a young male \"doctor of the law\", bearing a letter of recommendation to the Duke from the learned lawyer Bellario. The doctor is Portia in disguise, and the law clerk who accompanies her is Nerissa, also disguised as a man. As Balthasar, Portia repeatedly asks Shylock to show mercy in a famous speech, advising him that mercy \"is twice blest: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes\" (IV, i, 185). However, Shylock adamantly refuses any compensations and insists on the pound of flesh.\n\nAs the court grants Shylock his bond and Antonio prepares for Shylock's knife, Portia deftly appropriates Shylock's argument for \"specific performance\". She says that the contract allows Shylock to remove only the \"flesh\", not the \"blood\", of Antonio (see quibble). Thus, if Shylock were to shed any drop of Antonio's blood, his \"lands and goods\" would be forfeited under Venetian laws. She tells him that he must cut precisely one pound of flesh, no more, no less; she advises him that \"if the scale do turn, But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.\"\n\nDefeated, Shylock concedes to accepting Bassanio's offer of money for the defaulted bond, first his offer to pay \"the bond thrice\", which Portia rebuffs, telling him to take his bond, and then merely the principal, which Portia also prevents him from doing on the ground that he has already refused it \"in the open court\". She cites a law under which Shylock, as a Jew and therefore an \"alien\", having attempted to take the life of a citizen, has forfeited his property, half to the government and half to Antonio, leaving his life at the mercy of the Duke. The Duke pardons Shylock's life. Antonio asks for his share \"in use\" until Shylock's death, when the principal will be given to Lorenzo and Jessica. At Antonio's request, the Duke grants remission of the state's half of forfeiture, but on the condition that Shylock convert to Christianity and bequeath his entire estate to Lorenzo and Jessica (IV,i).\n\nBassanio does not recognise his disguised wife, but offers to give a present to the supposed lawyer. First she declines, but after he insists, Portia requests his ring and Antonio's gloves. Antonio parts with his gloves without a second thought, but Bassanio gives the ring only after much persuasion from Antonio, as earlier in the play he promised his wife never to lose, sell or give it. Nerissa, as the lawyer's clerk, succeeds in likewise retrieving her ring from Gratiano, who does not see through her disguise.\n\nAt Belmont, Portia and Nerissa taunt and pretend to accuse their husbands before revealing they were really the lawyer and his clerk in disguise (V). After all the other characters make amends, Antonio learns from Portia that three of his ships were not stranded and have returned safely after all.\n\nThe forfeit of a merchant's deadly bond after standing surety for a friend's loan was a common tale in England in the late 16th century. In addition, the test of the suitors at Belmont, the merchant's rescue from the \"pound of flesh\" penalty by his friend's new wife disguised as a lawyer, and her demand for the betrothal ring in payment are all elements present in the 14th-century tale \"Il Pecorone\" by Giovanni Fiorentino, which was published in Milan in 1558. Elements of the trial scene are also found in \"The Orator\" by Alexandre Sylvane, published in translation in 1596. The story of the three caskets can be found in \"Gesta Romanorum\", a collection of tales probably compiled at the end of the 13th century.\n\nThe date of composition for \"The Merchant of Venice\" is believed to be between 1596 and 1598. The play was mentioned by Francis Meres in 1598, so it must have been familiar on the stage by that date. The title page of the first edition in 1600 states that it had been performed \"divers times\" by that date. Salerino's reference to his ship the \"Andrew\" (I,i,27) is thought to be an allusion to the Spanish ship \"St. Andrew,\" captured by the English at Cádiz in 1596. A date of 1596–97 is considered consistent with the play's style.\n\nThe play was entered in the Register of the Stationers Company, the method at that time of obtaining copyright for a new play, by James Roberts on 22 July 1598 under the title \"The Merchant of Venice\", otherwise called \"The Jew of Venice\". On 28 October 1600 Roberts transferred his right to the play to the stationer Thomas Heyes; Heyes published the first quarto before the end of the year. It was printed again in 1619, as part of William Jaggard's so-called False Folio. (Afterward, Thomas Heyes' son and heir Laurence Heyes asked for and was granted a confirmation of his right to the play, on 8 July 1619.) The 1600 edition is generally regarded as being accurate and reliable. It is the basis of the text published in the 1623 First Folio, which adds a number of stage directions, mainly musical cues.\n\nThe play is frequently staged today, but is potentially troubling to modern audiences because of its central themes, which can easily appear antisemitic. Critics today still continue to argue over the play's stance on the Jews and Judaism.\nEnglish society in the Elizabethan era has been described as \"judeophobic\". English Jews had been expelled under Edward I in 1290 and were not permitted to return until 1656 under the rule of Oliver Cromwell. In Venice and in some other places, Jews were required to wear a red hat at all times in public to make sure that they were easily identified, and had to live in a ghetto protected by Christian guards.\n\nShakespeare's play may be seen as a continuation of this tradition. The title page of the Quarto indicates that the play was sometimes known as \"The Jew of Venice\" in its day, which suggests that it was seen as similar to Marlowe's \"The Jew of Malta\". One interpretation of the play's structure is that Shakespeare meant to contrast the mercy of the main Christian characters with the vengefulness of a Jew, who lacks the religious grace to comprehend mercy. Similarly, it is possible that Shakespeare meant Shylock's forced conversion to Christianity to be a \"happy ending\" for the character, as, to a Christian audience, it saves his soul and allows him to enter Heaven.\n\nRegardless of what Shakespeare's authorial intent may have been, the play has been made use of by antisemites throughout the play's history. The Nazis used the usurious Shylock for their propaganda. Shortly after Kristallnacht in 1938, \"The Merchant of Venice\" was broadcast for propagandistic ends over the German airwaves. Productions of the play followed in Lübeck (1938), Berlin (1940), and elsewhere within the Nazi territory.\n\nIn a series of articles called \"Observer\", first published in 1785, British playwright Richard Cumberland created a character named Abraham Abrahams, who is quoted as saying, \"I verily believe the odious character of Shylock has brought little less persecution upon us, poor scattered sons of Abraham, than the Inquisition itself.\" Cumberland later wrote a successful play, \"The Jew\" (1794), in which his title character, Sheva, is portrayed sympathetically, as both a kindhearted and generous man. This was the first known attempt by a dramatist to reverse the negative stereotype that Shylock personified.\n\nThe depiction of Jews in literature throughout the centuries bears the close imprint of Shylock. With slight variations much of English literature up until the 20th century depicts the Jew as \"a monied, cruel, lecherous, avaricious outsider tolerated only because of his golden hoard\".\n\nMany modern readers and theatregoers have read the play as a plea for tolerance, noting that Shylock is a sympathetic character. They cite as evidence that Shylock's \"trial\" at the end of the play is a mockery of justice, with Portia acting as a judge when she has no right to do so. The characters who berated Shylock for dishonesty resort to trickery in order to win. In addition, Shakespeare gives Shylock one of his most eloquent speeches:\n\nIt is difficult to know whether the sympathetic reading of Shylock is entirely due to changing sensibilities among readers—or whether Shakespeare, a writer who created complex, multi-faceted characters, deliberately intended this reading.\n\nOne of the reasons for this interpretation is that Shylock's painful status in Venetian society is emphasised. To some critics, Shylock's celebrated \"Hath not a Jew eyes?\" speech redeems him and even makes him into something of a tragic figure; in the speech, Shylock argues that he is no different from the Christian characters. Detractors note that Shylock ends the speech with a tone of revenge: \"if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?\" Those who see the speech as sympathetic point out that Shylock says he learned the desire for revenge from the Christian characters: \"If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.\"\n\nEven if Shakespeare did not intend the play to be read this way, the fact that it retains its power on stage for audiences who may perceive its central conflicts in radically different terms is an illustration of the subtlety of Shakespeare's characterisations. In the trial Shylock represents what Elizabethan Christians believed to be the Jewish desire for \"justice\", contrasted with their obviously superior Christian value of mercy. The Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to love his enemies, although they themselves have failed in the past. Jewish critic Harold Bloom suggests that, although the play gives merit to both cases, the portraits are not even-handed: \"Shylock's shrewd indictment of Christian hypocrisy delights us, but … Shakespeare’s intimations do not alleviate the savagery of his portrait of the Jew…\"\n\nAntonio's unexplained depression – \"In sooth I know not why I am so sad\" – and utter devotion to Bassanio has led some critics to theorise that he is suffering from unrequited love for Bassanio and is depressed because Bassanio is coming to an age where he will marry a woman. In his plays and poetry Shakespeare often depicted strong male bonds of varying homosociality, which has led some critics to infer that Bassanio returns Antonio's affections despite his obligation to marry:\nIn his essay \"Brothers and Others\", published in \"The Dyer's Hand,\" W. H. Auden describes Antonio as \"a man whose emotional life, though his conduct may be chaste, is concentrated upon a member of his own sex.\" Antonio's feelings for Bassanio are likened to a couplet from Shakespeare's \"Sonnets\": \"But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,/ Mine be thy love, and my love's use their treasure.\" Antonio, says Auden, embodies the words on Portia's leaden casket: \"Who chooseth me, must give and hazard all he hath.\" Antonio has taken this potentially fatal turn because he despairs, not only over the loss of Bassanio in marriage but also because Bassanio cannot requite what Antonio feels for him. Antonio's frustrated devotion is a form of idolatry: the right to live is yielded for the sake of the loved one. There is one other such idolator in the play: Shylock himself. \"Shylock, however unintentionally, did, in fact, hazard all for the sake of destroying the enemy he hated, and Antonio, however unthinkingly he signed the bond, hazarded all to secure the happiness of the man he loved.\" Both Antonio and Shylock, agreeing to put Antonio's life at a forfeit, stand outside the normal bounds of society. There was, states Auden, a traditional \"association of sodomy with usury\", reaching back at least as far as Dante, with which Shakespeare was likely familiar. (Auden sees the theme of usury in the play as a comment on human relations in a mercantile society.)\n\nOther interpreters of the play regard Auden's conception of Antonio's sexual desire for Bassanio as questionable. Michael Radford, director of the 2004 film version starring Al Pacino, explained that, although the film contains a scene where Antonio and Bassanio actually kiss, the friendship between the two is platonic, in line with the prevailing view of male friendship at the time. Jeremy Irons, in an interview, concurs with the director's view and states that he did not \"play Antonio as gay\". Joseph Fiennes, however, who plays Bassanio, encouraged a homoerotic interpretation and, in fact, surprised Irons with the kiss on set, which was filmed in one take. Fiennes defended his choice, saying \"I would never invent something before doing my detective work in the text. If you look at the choice of language … you'll read very sensuous language. That's the key for me in the relationship. The great thing about Shakespeare and why he's so difficult to pin down is his ambiguity. He's not saying they're gay or they're straight, he's leaving it up to his actors. I feel there has to be a great love between the two characters … there's great attraction. I don't think they have slept together but that's for the audience to decide.\"\n\nThe earliest performance of which a record has survived was held at the court of King James in the spring of 1605, followed by a second performance a few days later, but there is no record of any further performances in the 17th century. In 1701, George Granville staged a successful adaptation, titled \"The Jew of Venice\", with Thomas Betterton as Bassanio. This version (which featured a masque) was popular, and was acted for the next forty years. Granville cut the clownish Gobbos in line with neoclassical decorum; he added a jail scene between Shylock and Antonio, and a more extended scene of toasting at a banquet scene. Thomas Doggett was Shylock, playing the role comically, perhaps even farcically. Rowe expressed doubts about this interpretation as early as 1709; Doggett's success in the role meant that later productions would feature the troupe clown as Shylock.\n\nIn 1741, Charles Macklin returned to the original text in a very successful production at Drury Lane, paving the way for Edmund Kean seventy years later (see below).\n\nArthur Sullivan wrote incidental music for the play in 1871.\n\nJewish actor Jacob Adler and others report that the tradition of playing Shylock sympathetically began in the first half of the 19th century with Edmund Kean, and that previously the role had been played \"by a comedian as a repulsive clown or, alternatively, as a monster of unrelieved evil.\" Kean's Shylock established his reputation as an actor.\n\nFrom Kean's time forward, all of the actors who have famously played the role, with the exception of Edwin Booth, who played Shylock as a simple villain, have chosen a sympathetic approach to the character; even Booth's father, Junius Brutus Booth, played the role sympathetically. Henry Irving's portrayal of an aristocratic, proud Shylock (first seen at the Lyceum in 1879, with Portia played by Ellen Terry) has been called \"the summit of his career\". Jacob Adler was the most notable of the early 20th century: Adler played the role in Yiddish-language translation, first in Manhattan's Yiddish Theater District in the Lower East Side, and later on Broadway, where, to great acclaim, he performed the role in Yiddish in an otherwise English-language production.\n\nKean and Irving presented a Shylock justified in wanting his revenge; Adler's Shylock evolved over the years he played the role, first as a stock Shakespearean villain, then as a man whose better nature was overcome by a desire for revenge, and finally as a man who operated not from revenge but from pride. In a 1902 interview with \"Theater\" magazine, Adler pointed out that Shylock is a wealthy man, \"rich enough to forgo the interest on three thousand ducats\" and that Antonio is \"far from the chivalrous gentleman he is made to appear. He has insulted the Jew and spat on him, yet he comes with hypocritical politeness to borrow money of him.\" Shylock's fatal flaw is to depend on the law, but \"would he not walk out of that courtroom head erect, the very apotheosis of defiant hatred and scorn?\"\n\nSome modern productions take further pains to show the sources of Shylock's thirst for vengeance. For instance, in the 2004 film adaptation directed by Michael Radford and starring Al Pacino as Shylock, the film begins with text and a montage of how Venetian Jews are cruelly abused by bigoted Christians. One of the last shots of the film also brings attention to the fact that, as a convert, Shylock would have been cast out of the Jewish community in Venice, no longer allowed to live in the ghetto. Another interpretation of Shylock and a vision of how \"must he be acted\" appears at the conclusion of the autobiography of Alexander Granach, a noted Jewish stage and film actor in Weimar Germany (and later in Hollywood and on Broadway).\n\nThe play has inspired many adaptions and several works of fiction.\n\n\n\nEdmond Haraucourt, French playwright and poet, was commissioned in the 1880s by the actor and theatrical director Paul Porel to make a French-verse adaptation of \"The Merchant of Venice\". His play \"Shylock\", first performed at the Théâtre de l'Odéon in December 1889, had incidental music by the French composer Gabriel Fauré, later incorporated into an orchestral suite of the same name.\n\nRalph Vaughan Williams' choral work \"Serenade to Music\" (1938) draws its text from the discussion about music and the music of the spheres in Act V, scene 1.\n\nIn both versions of the comic film \"To Be or Not to Be\" (1942 and 1983) the character \"Greenberg\", specified as a Jew in the later version, gives a recitation of the \"Hath Not a Jew eyes?\" speech to Nazi soldiers.\n\nThe rock musical \"Fire Angel\" was based on the story of the play, with the scene changed to the Little Italy district of New York. It was performed in Edinburgh in 1974 and in a revised form at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, in 1977. Braham Murray directed.\n\nArnold Wesker's play \"The Merchant\" (1976) is a reimagening of Shakespeare's story. In this retelling, Shylock and Antonio are friends and share a disdain for the crass anti-Semitism of the Christian community's laws.\n\nDavid Henry Wilson's play \"Shylock's Revenge\", was first produced at the University of Hamburg in 1989, and follows the events in \"The Merchant of Venice\". In this play Shylock gets his wealth back and becomes a Jew again.\n\nThe \"Star Trek\" franchise sometimes quote and paraphrase Shakespeare, including \"The Merchant of Venice\". One example is the Shakespeare-aficionado Chang in \"\" (1991), a Klingon, who quotes Shylock.\n\nSteven Spielberg's \"Schindler's List\" (1993) depicts SS Lieutenant Amon Göth quoting Shylock's \"Hath Not a Jew eyes?\" speech when deciding whether or not to rape his Jewish maid.\n\nIn David Fincher's 1995 crime thriller \"Seven\", a lawyer, Eli Gould, is coerced to remove a pound of his own flesh and place it on a scale, alluding to the play.\n\nOne of the four short stories comprising Alan Isler's \"The Bacon Fancier\" (1999) is also told from Shylock's point of view. In this story, Antonio was a converted Jew.\n\n\"The Pianist\" is a 2002 film based on a memoir by Władysław Szpilman. In this film, Henryk Szpilman reads Shylock's \"Hath Not a Jew eyes?\" speech to his brother Władysław in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Nazi occupation in World War II.\n\nIn the 2009 spy comedy \"\", a speech by the nazi Von Zimmel parodies Shylock's tirade.\n\nChristopher Moore combines \"The Merchant of Venice\" and \"Othello\" in his 2014 comic novel \"The Serpent of Venice\", in which he makes Portia (from \"The Merchant of Venice\") and Desdemona (from \"Othello\") sisters. All of the characters come from those two plays with the exception of Pocket, the Fool, who comes from Moore's earlier novel based on \"King Lear\".\n\nNaomi Alderman's \"The Wolf in the Water\" is a radio-play first broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 2016. The play continues the story of Shylock's daughter Jessica, who lives in an anti-semitic Venice and practices her Jewish faith in secret. Part of the BBC's Shakespeare Festival, the play also marked that 500 years had passed since the Venetian Ghetto was instituted.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "947323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=947323", "title": "The Paper Chase (novel)", "text": "The Paper Chase (novel)\n\nThe Paper Chase is a 1971 novel written by John Jay Osborn, Jr., a 1970 graduate of Harvard Law School. The book tells the story of Hart, a first-year law student at Harvard, and his experiences with Professor Charles Kingsfield, the brilliant, demanding contracts instructor whom he both idolizes and finds incredibly intimidating.\n\nThe novel inspired an eponymous 1973 film and then a television series, which ran from 1978 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1986.\n\nOsborn wrote the novel as a third-year student at Harvard Law School. William Alfred, a Harvard humanities professor and playwright, coached him in writing the book.\n\nThe story centers on Hart, a young law student from Minnesota who attends Harvard Law School and becomes obsessed with one of his teachers, Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. Hart becomes an expert on Kingsfield's subject, contracts; he reads everything about the subject, including all of Kingsfield's papers, most of which are not on the reading list. He goes so far as to break into the law library to read Kingsfield's original law school notes. Hart becomes such an expert that Kingsfield asks him to contribute to a paper.\n\nAt the same time, he begins a relationship with Susan Field, who turns out to be Kingsfield's daughter. Susan stands aloof from the law-school rat-race and dismisses all the things Hart cares about most.\n\nAfter much effort preparing for the final exam, Hart's grade is delivered to him, but he simply makes a paper airplane out of his final report card, and sends it sailing into the Atlantic Ocean without looking at it.\n\nProfessor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. is one of the key characters in the novel, film and television series. Kingsfield is an imperious, highly respected (and feared) professor of contracts at Harvard Law School, known for his unrelenting use of the Socratic method on his students.\n\nKingsfield himself was a law student at Harvard, as shown by the presence of his own class notes in the institution's archives. Kingsfield has a daughter with a fiercely independent personality.\n\nDuring an event at Harvard Law School to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the book's release, the author said that the character was a composite of several of his professors at Harvard Law School, saying, \"It wasn’t like it was hard to find role models.\" Many Harvard Law graduates believe the character to be a composite of Contracts professor Clark Byse and Property Law professor A.J. Casner, legendary intimidating users of the Socratic method. Osborn has stated that Contracts was his favorite law school course. John Houseman, who played the role in the film and television series, said that he based his performance, in part, on stories he was told by former students of Earl Henry Warren, a professor at the law school from 1904–45. Warren, who taught a first-year property-law course, was famous at the school for his sarcastic comments during lectures and intimidating manner. Houseman's performance was also based on his experience as a professor and director of the drama department at the Juilliard School.\n\nThe novel is divided into three sections: Fall (chapters 1–15), Winter (chapters 16–33), and Spring (chapters 34–58). Chapters 1, 3, 13, 27, and 35 begin with quotes that set the tone for those chapters.\n\nIn 2010, a 40th-anniversary edition of \"The Paper Chase\" was released by Peninsula Road Press, which contains a new preface. This edition is the only one prepared by the author.\n\nAccording to Osborn, the 1973 film is based \"almost word for word\" on the novel. It starred John Houseman as Kingsfield and Timothy Bottoms as Hart.\n\nCBS aired a one-hour drama series in the 1978–1979 season based on the movie. John Houseman reprised his movie role, and James Stephens played Hart. In 1983, pay-cable network Showtime brought back the show with both Houseman and Stephens. At the end of three seasons on Showtime, Hart finally graduated.\n"}

At that time, they were similar in concept to the EN 13402 European clothing size standard, although individual manufacturers have always deviated from them, sometimes significantly.\n\nHowever, as a result of various cultural pressures, most notably vanity sizing, North American clothing sizes have drifted substantially away from this standard over time, and now have very little connection to it. Instead, they now follow the more loosely defined standards known as U.S. catalog sizes.\n\nBody measurements below are given in inches.\n\nMen's standard sizes were probably developed first during the American Revolutionary War, and they were in regular use by the American army during the War of 1812 for ready-made uniforms . These were based on the chest measurement, with other measurements being assumed to be either proportional (the circumference of the neck, waist, hips, and thighs) or easily altered (length of the inseam) .\n\nAs this was largely successful in men, the same approach was attempted in the early 20th century for women using the bust as the sole measurement . However, this proved unsuccessful because women's bodies have far more variety in shape. The hourglass figure is frequently used as an industry standard, but only 8% of women have this body shape . A woman with an hourglass figure and a woman with an apple-shaped figure who have the same bust size will not have the same waist or hip sizes.\n\nThis was a significant problem for mail-order companies, and several attempts at predictable, standard sizing were made . In the 1940s, the statisticians Ruth O'Brien and William Shelton received a Works Progress Administration grant to conduct the most ambitious effort to solve this problem. Their team measured almost 15,000 women across the US. After discovering the complex diversity of women's actual sizes, which produced five to seven different body shapes, they proposed a three-part sizing system. Each size would be the combination of a single number, representing an upper body measurement, plus an indicator for height (short, regular, and long) and an indication for girth (slim, regular, and stout). The various combinations of height and girth resulted in nine different sizes for each numerical upper-body measurement, which was highly impractical for manufacturing .\n\nAs a result, O'Brien and Shelton's work was rejected. In 1958, the National Bureau of Standards invented a new sizing system, based on the hourglass figure and using only the bust size to create an arbitrary standard of sizes ranging from 8 to 38, with an indication for height (short, regular, and tall) and lower-body girth (plus or minus). The resulting commercial standard was not widely popular, and was declared voluntary in 1970 and withdrawn entirely in 1983. In 1995, ASTM International published its own voluntary standard, which has been revised since then . It has not been widely adopted.\n\nWomen's sizes are divided into various types, depending on height. These charts give an indication of size only and are by no means exact as they vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, sometimes by a full inch up and down.\n\nThere are multiple size types, designed to fit somewhat different body shapes. Variations include the height of the person's torso (known as \"back length\"), whether the bust, waist, and hips are straighter (characteristic of teenagers) or curvier (like many adult women), and whether the bust is higher or lower (characteristic of younger and older women, respectively). These categories include:\n\n\nPlease compare to your favorite fit charts. These measurements conflict with many other size charts. These charts are significantly smaller than many current US clothing companies.\n\nCompanies who publish catalogs may provide the measurements for their sizes, which may vary even among different styles of the same type of garment. The sizes seen in catalogs generally have roughly the following measurements:\n\nWith the average American woman's height (20 years and older) at about 63.8\" or approximately 5'4\" (162.1 cm) , both standard and catalog size ranges attempt to address a variety of weights / builds as well as providing for the \"shorter-than-average\" height woman with \"petite\" and \"half-sizes\". However \"taller-than-average\" women may find their size-height addressed by manufacturers less frequently, and may often find themselves facing issues of slightly too short pant legs and sleeve cuffs, as well as waist lengths.\n\nCurrent and former national standards:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9274422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9274422", "title": "Vannes Cathedral", "text": "Vannes Cathedral\n\nVannes Cathedral () is a Roman Catholic church dedicated to Saint Peter in Vannes, Brittany, France. The cathedral is the seat of the Bishop of Vannes.\n\nThe present Gothic church was erected on the site of the former Romanesque cathedral. Its construction lasted from the 15th to the 19th centuries; if the length of the existence of the 13th century Romanesque bell tower is included, a total of seven centuries of construction.\n\nThe cathedral was declared a basilica minor by Pope Pius IX on 5 June 1870.\n\nThe first building was erected around 1020 in Romanesque style. Built out of granite and continuously modified by adding new structures, the cathedral is an extremely composite building. The rebuilding in Gothic style dates mainly from the 15th and 16th centuries. In this period the nave and the ornate gateway at the northern end of the north transept – whose twelve niches, according to Breton custom, were supposed to accommodate the Apostles – were built high. The northern tower is the main remnant of the former Romanesque building, while the vaults and the choir were built between 1771 and 1774.\n\nThe horizontal dimensions of the building can be derived from the ground plan. (Data on the heights are not available for the moment). The building is one of the largest on the French Atlantic coast.\n\nThe façade was carved in 1857 in a neo-Gothic style. Outside, in front of the central pillar of the large gate, stands a statue of the Dominican monk St. Vincent Ferrer, from Valencia. His activities in the 15th century greatly influenced Christianity in Vannes. The northern façade opens onto the garden of the cloister (ruins from the 16th century) and the \"Rue des chanoines\" (\"Street of the Canons\") through the beautiful portal at the top of the north transept, built in a Flamboyant late Gothic style (1514), and decorated with twelve niches designed to house statues of the twelve apostles. The cross, visible close to the northern façade, dates back to the 15th century and was brought from the cemetery.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the floor of the cathedral had been covered by tombstones. For hygienic reasons, only the tradition of burying the bishops in their episcopal church has been preserved. However, some tombstones have been returned and can be seen today. The cathedral has only retained tombs dating back to the 17th century. Two bishops' tombs can be found in the crypt under the choir.\n\nThe building contains the following features:\n\n\n\nPositions 9, 10, 11, 13 and 17 are the Blessed Sacrament Chapel (closed to visitors), the Chapel of Our Lady \"de Pitié\", the Chapel in the apse, the Calvary and the Chapel of St. Louis respectively.\n\nIn the novels of Alexandre Dumas, the musketeer Aramis appears at one point as Bishop of Vannes and logically must have served in this very cathedral.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19833182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19833182", "title": "Vasilissa ergo gaude", "text": "Vasilissa ergo gaude\n\nVasilissa ergo gaude (\"Therefore rejoice, princess\") is an isorhythmic motet by the Renaissance composer Guillaume Dufay. In terms of its subject matter, it is sometimes grouped together with \"Lamentatio sanctae matris ecclesiae Constantinopolitanae\", \"Apostolus gloriosus\" and \"Balsamus et munda cera\" which are generically called Dufay's \"Byzantine motets\". Its composition was occasioned by the marriage on 21 January 1421 of Cleofa Malatesta, daughter of Malatesta di Pandolfo, to Theodore II Palaiologos son of the Byzantine emperor Manuel II and Despot of the Morea. It has been surmised that the actual motet was composed in 1420 and is perhaps the earliest example of this choral form if not the earliest work attributed to Dufay. In earlier scholarship it was assumed that the motet's first performance had taken place on May 19, 1419 during the festivities prior to the marriage \n\nThe tenor line is taken from Psalm 45:11 (44:11 in the traditional Catholic numbering), whose theme is royal marriage. The verse chosen for the motet occurs in Catholic liturgy in the Gradual of various feasts of the Virgin Mary. The motet is preserved in the contemporary music manuscript Codex Bologna, International museum and library of music, MS Q15.\nIn terms of structure the composition has been compared with the mature work of Johannes Ciconia, a Franco-Flemish composer also active in Italy. Of the four voices used, the two upper voices bearing the melody often imitate each other and move faster than the two lower voices. The talea is repeated only once. An additional device independent from the motet's purely isorhythmic design is the canonic introit (a short canon used as a prelude) appearing at the beginning of the composition. \n\nEven though numerological mysticism which is often encountered in the Ars Antiqua seems to have been of minor importance in musical composition from the 14th century onwards, there have been attempts to interpret the motet's texture and design from a symbolic-mystical viewpoint. Dufay is known to have utilised similar devices such as gematria (a system of number symbolism drawn from the Pythagorean corpus) in other nuptial compositions. The tenor line singing the Cantus firmus in \"Vasilissa ergo gaude\" consists of a total of 2x49 notes plus the two closing notes which add to a total of 100 notes. It has been suggested that this number implies the medieval symbolism for repentance which leads to absolute unity. It has further been proposed that the number 100 should be related to the total of 700 or else 7x100 notes of the remaining three voices, alluding thus to the sacred number 7. The sum total of notes in the motet is 800 and this has been interpreted as an allusion to the number 8. In medieval numerology, 8 signified eternity, understood in the context of Dufay's motet as eternal stability. \n\nAll these numerical symbolisms must have had a particular significance in view of the politically motivated marriage between Cleofa Malatesta and Theodore Palaiologos. The marriage was arranged as part of a series of diplomatic gestures between Cleofa's uncle Pope Martin V and the Byzantine emperor. It was hoped that it would facilitate reunification between the Roman Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Church (cf. Council of Florence).\n\n"}
