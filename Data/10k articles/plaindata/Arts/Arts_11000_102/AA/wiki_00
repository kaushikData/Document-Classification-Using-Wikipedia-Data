{"id": "44514645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44514645", "title": "ASHRAE 55", "text": "ASHRAE 55\n\nANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55: Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy is an American National Standard published by ASHRAE that establishes the ranges of indoor environmental conditions to achieve acceptable thermal comfort for occupants of buildings. It was first published in 1966, and since 2004 has been updated every three to six years. The most recent version of the standard was published in 2017.\n\nThe body of the standard consists of a foreword (describing changes made in the current version), eight sections and two normative appendices:\n\nAfter the body of the standard there are 11 informative appendices. These are not part of the standard, but provide additional information about terms and methods described within the standard, as well as a bibliography, and a description of the addenda incorporated from the previous version in the current version.\n\nAs described within the standard: \"The purpose of the standard is to specify the combinations of indoor thermal environmental factors and personal factors that will produce thermal environmental conditions acceptable to a majority of the occupants within the space\".\n\nThe standard addresses the four primary environmental factors (temperature, thermal radiation, humidity, and air speed) and two personal factors (activity and clothing) that affect thermal comfort. It is applicable for healthy adults at atmospheric pressures in altitudes up to (or equivalent to) , and for indoor spaces designed for occupancy of at least 15 minutes.\n\nAdaptive model is a model that relates indoor design temperatures or acceptable temperature ranges to outdoor meteorological or climatological parameters.\n\nThermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation.\n\nA occupant-controlled naturally conditioned space is where the thermal conditions of the space are primarily regulated by occupant-controlled openings.\n\nPredicted mean vote is an index that predicts the mean value of the thermal sensation votes (self-reported perceptions) of a large group of persons on a sensation scale expressed from -3 to +3 corresponding to the categories \"cold,\" \"cool,\" \"slightly cool,\" \"neutral,\" \"slight warm,\" \"warm,\" and \"hot.\"\n\nComfort zone refers to the combinations of air temperature, mean radiant temperature (tr), and humidity that are predicted to be an acceptable thermal environment at particular values of air speed, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation (I)\n\nClothing insulation is the resistance to sensible heat transfer provided by a clothing ensemble (expressed in units of clo, which is a unit to quantify the insulation provided by garments and clothing ensembles. 1 \"clo\" = 0.155 m² °C/W (0.88 ft²·h·°F/Btu))\n\nMetabolic rate is the rate of transformation of chemical energy into heat and mechanical work by metabolic activities of an individual, per unit of skin surface are (expressed in units of met) equal to 58.2 W/m² (18.4 Btu/h·ft²), which is the energy produced per unit skin surface area of an average person seated at rest.\n\nExceedance hour is the number of occupied hours within a defined time period in which the environmental conditions in an occupied space are outside the comfort zone.\n\nThe graphic method utilizes an overlay on a psychrometric chart to indicate the operative temperatures and humidity at which thermal comfort is achieved in the winter (1.0 \"clo\") and summer (0.5 \"clo\"). It is based on the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model. The graphic comfort zone model is limited in applicability to conditions when the metabolic rate of occupants is 1.0-1.3 met and the humidity ratio is below 0.012 kg HO/kg dry air (0.012 lb HO/lb dry air). If these requirements are met and the environmental conditions inside the building fall within the indicated ranges, then compliance is achieved.\n\nFor humidity ratios above 0.012 kg HO/kg dry air (0.012 lb HO/lb dry air), or for metabolic rates up to 2.0 met, the analytical model must be used to determine thermal comfort sensation. Also based on the PMV model, this method uses tools such as the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool or the online CBE Thermal Comfort Tool to evaluate thermal comfort. Users provide operative temperature (or air temperature and mean radiant temperature), air speed, humidity, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation value, and the tool evaluates predicted thermal sensation on a scale from -3 (cold) to +3 (hot). Compliance is achieved if the conditions provide thermal neutrality, measured as falling between -0.5 and +0.5 on the PMV scale.\n\nThe section sets provisions for increasing the upper air temperature limit at elevated air speeds above . The methodology is based on the SET (Standard Effective Temperature) model, which provides a way to assign an effective temperature (at a standard metabolic rate, and clothing insulation values) to compare thermal sensations experienced at a range of thermal conditions. The upper limit of air speed is based on whether occupants have local control or not. To evaluate compliance, the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool may be used, or a computer model validated against the code provided in Informative Appendix G of the standard.\n\nRadiant temperature asymmetry between ceiling and floor, and air and walls must be limited to reduce discomfort. To reduce draft risk at temperatures below , air speed due to the HVAC system must be or below. The vertical air temperature difference between ankle and head is limited to for seated occupants and for standing occupants. If occupants' feet will be in contact with the floor, the temperature must be .\n\nWhen occupants do not have control over the cyclical variation or drifts in indoor environmental conditions, the conditions within this section must be met. Operative temperatures may not fluctuate more than within 15 minutes, nor change more than within 1 hour.\n\nThis method, also known as the adaptive comfort model, is applicable in buildings without mechanical cooling (and no operating heating system) where occupants’ met rates are 1.0-1.3 met and their clothing levels are 0.5-1.0 \"clo\". For this model the standard provides a graph of acceptable indoor temperature limits at prevailing mean outdoor temperatures (a mean of the daily mean outdoor temperatures of the previous 7–30 days). An accompanying table lists provisions for higher operative temperatures at air speeds above and up to . The graph is valid for prevailing mean temperatures between . It provides 80% and 90% acceptability ranges, indicating the percentage of occupants expected to be comfortable at the indicated indoor and prevailing mean outdoor temperatures.\n\nThis section of the standard is applicable for the design of buildings. All of the building systems must be designed to maintain the occupied spaces at the indoor conditions specified by one of the described evaluation methods at design conditions. The systems must be able to maintain these conditions within the expected range of indoor and outdoor operating conditions.\n\nTo demonstrate compliance the following must be documented, where applicable. Sample documentation is provided in Informative Appendix J.\n\nAlthough the \"ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55\" does not require the evaluation of comfort in existing building, this part of the standard offers a guideline of performing an evaluation when one is required from other codes or standard. Generally, the evaluation of comfort in existing buildings can be performed from two perspectives: from occupant satisfaction survey and physical environmental measurements.\n\nIndoor thermal comfort can be determined from the responses of the occupant survey. The survey shall be distributed to the entire occupancy or representative part of the occupancy. The standard suggests that if the surveys were distributed to more than 45 occupants, the response rate must exceed 35%. If that number is between 20 and 45, the minimum number of responses is 15. When the number is under 20, at least 16 must reply for the survey to make the survey representative.\n\nFor satisfaction surveys, the thermal satisfaction scale shall end with choices: \"very satisfied\" and \"very dissatisfied\", and, also, the occupants should be allowed to explain their dissatisfaction by answering an open-ended question. As for point-in-time surveys, the survey should be solicited during the time of occupancy, and the satisfaction scale ought to be continuous. There should be at least seven points on the scale ending with \"very acceptable\" and \"very unacceptable.\" The standard also specifies that when asking thermal sensation questions, the scale should be \"cold, cool, slightly cool, neutral, slightly warm, warm, and hot.\" \n\nFor mechanically conditioned spaces, the PMV-based comfort zone has to be determined, which includes measuring and recording the metabolic activity and clothing insulation. The comfort zone boundaries must be adjusted to the air movements, and the zone conditions should be adjusted to avoid local thermal discomfort. For occupant-controlled naturally conditioned space, the adaptive model shall be used to determine the thermal comfort boundaries. For such spaces, the indoor and outdoor air temperature and mean radiant temperature and the air speed need to be measured.\n\n\"ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55\" provides guideline on the position, time, and equipment accuracy of the physical measurement. The measurement locations should be where the occupants are expected to spend time in. If there are multiple such locations, the measurement can be performed at a representative location. In cases that the optimal representative location cannot be found, the standard suggests specific locations in the space.\n\nFor seating occupants, the air temperature and air speed measurements shall be taken at heights of 0.1, 0.6, and 1.1 m (4, 24, and 43 in.), and operative temperature and PMV shall be measured at 0.6 m (24 in.). The heights need to be adjusted for standing persons. Local discomfort caused by radiant temperature asymmetry shall be measured at occupants’ locations, with the sensors oriented to catch the maximum surface temperature differences.\n\nThe standard suggests that the time of measurements should last two or more hours long, and it should also be a representative time of the year for this specific building. Measuring time step should be no more than five minutes for air temperature, mean radiant temperature, and humidity, and no more than three minutes for the air speed.\n\nIn order to achieve acceptable results, the standard also suggests the minimum equipment accuracy based the current industry standard.\n\nWhen extracting environmental data from the Building Administration System, one should evaluate the location, height, and time step of the sensors based on the previous suggestion.\n\nTo evaluate the probability of satisfaction from satisfaction surveys, the standard suggests dividing the number of the votes falling between \"just satisfied\" and \"very satisfied\" by the total number of votes in that questions. The answers of open-ended questions from \"very dissatisfied\" occupants should be documented for later analysis. For point-in-time surveys, the comfort evaluation shall be performed by dividing the number of votes between -1 and +3 by the total number of votes. One has to keep in mind that the results from point-in-time surveys are only effective during the time when the surveys were solicited.\n\nThe measured results should be evaluated against the adjusted comfort zone for the specific building. There are two cases when evaluating thermal comfort: at a specific time or over a period of time. For a mechanically conditioned space at an instance in time, the PMV and SET model shall be used to establish the comfort zone, and the local thermal discomfort shall be evaluated against the limit posed this standard as well. For occupant-controlled naturally conditioned spaces, the measured results shall be check with the comfort zone established by adaptive model.\n\nTo evaluate the thermal comfort over a period of time in a mechanically conditioned space, the exceedance hours are the sum of all the hours when the absolute value of PMV is greater than 0.5. For an occupant-controlled naturally conditioned space, the exceedance hours are the sum of hours when the operative temperature falls outside of the lower and upper boundaries of the comfort zone.\n\nMetabolic rate is the rate of transformation of chemical energy into heat and mechanical work by metabolic activities of an individual. It is defined as per unit of skin surface area which equals to 58.2 W/m² (18.4 Btu/h·ft²). This is the energy produced from a unit skin surface area of an average person seated at rest.\n\n\"ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55\" provides a table of metabolic rate of different continuous activities. These values are valid for an average adult with surface skin area of 1.8 m² (19.6 ft²). The standard reminds the users that they should use their own judgment to match the activities being considered to the comparable activities in the table. Except sedentary activities, metabolic rate for all other activities is likely to have range of variation. This variation is depending on the individual performing the task and his/her environment.\n\nWhen the duration of an activity is equal or less than one hour, one can use a time-weighted metabolic rate. As metabolic rates increase over 1.0 met, the evaporation of the sweat becomes an increasingly important factor, and the PMV method does not fully account for this factor.\n\nClothing insulation refers to the heat transfer of the entire body, which includes the uncovered parts, such as hands and heads. There is a variety of means to determine the insulation provided by clothing. Accurate data from the measurement using thermal manikins is acceptable. When such measurement is not feasible, this standard provides four methods to determine the clothing insulation. It is also specified that the methods provided by this standard are no longer valid when the clothing insulation exceed 1.5 \"clo\". And it is also not valid when occupants wear clothing that is highly impermeable to moisture transport.\nThe first method is the least accurate, according to \"ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55\", and the accuracy increases in order of the methods.\n\nFirst, one can estimate the clothing insulation from the table provided in section five. If the clothing ensemble in question reasonably matches the clothing ensemble in the table, the indicated value can be used. The second method is to add or subtract individual garment clo value to achieve the clothing ensemble in question. Section five of the \"ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55\" provides a table with clothing insulation of a variety of individual garments. This table can be used together with the previous one, so that one can add or subtract the clothing ensemble from the \"clo\" value of each garment. The third method is to add all the \"clo\" value of each garment to match the clothing ensemble in question.\n\nThe fourth method described in \"ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55\" can be used to determine the clothing insulation in mechanically conditioned spaces. This method is based on the concept that when occupants choose their clothing according to their environment, the outdoor environment is more influential than the indoor one. There is a figure in the section five of the standard which predicts the representative clothing insulation of the occupants as a function of the average outdoor air temperature at 06:00 am. The function line has four segments: the average outdoor air temperature is below , between and , between and , and above .\n\nThere is a function to determine the representative clothing insulation at each segment. One can also take into account the posture of the occupants. So far, all the clothing insulation value can be used when the occupant is standing. When occupant is sitting, one has to realize the insulation effect of the chair, and the decrease of insulation due to compression of the air in the clothing.\n\nIf the occupant is moving, it also affects the insulation value of clothing. In general, body motion decreases the clothing insulation by pumping air through clothing. \"ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55\" recognizes that this effect varies largely depending on the nature of the movements and the nature clothing, such as how tight the clothing is. Thus, it only provides an approximation of the clothing insulation value of a moving person. This approximation is an equation that relates the clothing insulation with the metabolic rate. And this equation is only valid when the metabolic rate is between 1.2 and 2.0.\n\n\"ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55\" also states that the thermal environment conditions desired for sleeping and resting vary largely among individuals and cannot be determined using the methods provided in this standard. Considering that a sleeping person or one in reclining posture will be provided with sufficient insulation with the bedding material, and he or she is also free to adjust, it is impossible to determine the clothing insulation effect for these occupants unless they are immobile.\n\n\"ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55\" cautious the users that there are two forms of variability among occupants. In the first form, different individuals wear different clothing due to factors that are not related to thermal conditions, and the second form is opposite. For the first, it is not correct to use the average clothing insulation value to determine the desired thermal conditions for all occupants.\n\n\"ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55\" was first published in 1966. It was revised in 1974, 1981, 1992, 2004, 2010, 2013 and 2017. Starting in 2004, it is now updated based on ASHRAE’s standard maintenance procedures. These periodic revisions are based on publicly reviewed addenda to the previous version available on ASHRAE’s website.\nIn 1992 the standard was updated with more extensive information on measurement protocols and an expanded definitions section.\nIn 2004 the standard underwent significant changes with the addition of two thermal comfort models: the PMV/PPD model and the adaptive comfort model.\nIn 2010 the standard included the following changes. It re-introduced the Standard Effective Temperature (SET) as a method to calculate the cooling effect of air movement. It also added a general satisfaction survey to section 7 intended to evaluate general thermal comfort in an occupied space, bringing the standard in line with current survey-based post-occupancy evaluation (POE) practices.\nIn 2013 the body of the standard was rewritten in mandatory language, with informative language moved from the body of the standard to informative appendices. The applicability of the cooling effect of air movement was expanded to apply to naturally conditioned spaces. Section 7 underwent major revisions for measuring thermal comfort in existing spaces including procedures for physical measurements and survey methods, and how to evaluate and report results. The last major change concerns measuring air speed and air temperature experienced by the occupant, which now must be an average across three heights and over a period of time.\n\n\n"}

It is the source of art, science, innovation and economic development. Without it, individuals and societies stagnate.\n\nThis creative imagination requires access to the ideas, learning and culture of others, past and present. And, in the future, others will use what we have done.\nHuman rights call on us to ensure that everyone can create, access, use and share information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and societies to achieve their full potential.\n\nCreativity and investment should be recognised and rewarded. The purpose of intellectual property law (such as copyright and patents) should be, now as it was in the past, to ensure both the sharing of knowledge and the rewarding of innovation.\n\nThe expansion in the law’s breadth, scope and term over the last 30 years has resulted in an intellectual property regime which is radically out of line with modern technological, economic and social trends.

It features a memorable soundtrack by Ghazal duo, Jagjit Singh and Chitra Singh.\n\nThe semi-autobiographical film was written by Mahesh Bhatt about his extramarital relationship with Parveen Babi. It is one of the 25 Must See Bollywood Movies as compiled by Indiatimes Movies. The film was remade in Tamil as \"Marupadiyum\" (1993) by Balu Mahendra. In 2017, Pakistani actor and director Shaan Shahid released a sequel, \"Arth 2\" and Bhatt acted as a \"mentor\" during production.\n\nPooja (Shabana Azmi), who grew up as an orphan girl and always dreamt of owning a house, becomes insecure when she finds out that she and her husband, Inder (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), have to leave the apartment they rent. The twist that occurred when Inder gives her the keys of a new house proves to be double-edged, when it is revealed that he is in love with another woman, Kavita (Smita Patil), with whom he earned the money (in the film industry) for the new apartment. While previously giving advice to her maid (Rohini Hattangadi) cheated by her husband, now Pooja becomes herself involved in a similar situation. When Inder deserts Pooja for Kavita, she chooses to leave the apartment for a women's hostel with only 2000 that she had when she got married. She is helped by Raj (Raj Kiran) to surpass the difficulties of life as a single person, to find a job and to rely morally on herself. Raj and Pooja become good friends. Gradually, Kavita's mental instability deepens her fears of insecurity, even after Inder requests Pooja to sign the divorce papers.\nRaj falls in love with Pooja and proposes to her. She refuses saying she is empty and cannot give him anything. Raj tries to persuade her saying that she cannot spend the rest of her life feeling miserable about the past and that she should try to find a new life for herself. Pooja promises to think about it.\n\nPooja's maid, whose only aim in life is to secure a good education for her daughter, has saved 1000 towards her admission fees. She finds out that her drunk husband has stolen the money. Furious, she searches for him to find him in the arms of his lover after spending all the money.

He is sometimes referred to as \"The Elder\", to distinguish him from his son of the same name, who lived from 1812 to 1850, and was also a painter.\n\nHe received his first lessons in painting at the École des Beaux-Arts from Antoine-Jean Gros. In 1812, he enlisted as an officer in the Hussars, participated in the French invasion of Russia, and was captured by cossacks during the Battle of Krasnoi. After his release in 1814, he remained in Russia and became a citizen; having married a Russian woman. \n\nIn 1815, he presented some of his paintings at the Imperial Academy of Arts, depicting various activities of the Russian cavalry.

Described as activist first and filmmaker second, Guerrero focuses on collaborative work with her communities creating art forms that offer opportunities for dialogue and education.\n\nGuerrero was born in the Mission District of San Francisco, California to Mexican immigrant parents, later growing up on the border of Richmond and El Cerritos cities, while working at her parents small Mexican restaurant in Berkeley. Guerrero studied both Psychology and Chicano studies at University of California, Berkeley completing a Bachelor of Arts. She later moved to Los Angeles to study directing at California Institute of the Arts in Santa Clarita, California earning a Master of Fine Arts. Her narrative work often examines the intersection of the working class, queer, and of color. \n\nEarly in her career, she co-founded Womyn Image Makers (WIM) along with Dalila Mendez, Maritza Alvarez and Claudia Mercado. As WIM, in 2005, she directed the short film \"Pura Lengua\", which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival. Her second short film, \"Viernes Girl\", won the 2005 HBO/New York International Latino Film Festival short film competition. Both films caught the attention of film institutions such as Sundance, Tribeca, and Film Independent. Guerrero also went on to assist director Patricia Cardoso on her debut feature \"Real Women Have Curves\", which won the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award in 2002. In 2005 Guerrero was selected as a Sundance Institute Ford Foundation film fellow. While there, she participated in the Native Indigenous Lab with her script for \"Mosquita y Mari\".\n\nIn 2012, Guerrero made her feature film debut at the Sundance Film Festival with \"Mosquita y Mari\", becoming the first Chicana filmmaker to debut a feature-length film who was also previously a Sundance Institute and Ford Foundation Fellow. \"Mosquita y Mari\" has since traveled over 100 film festivals including San Francisco International, Melbourne, Guadalajara, Sao Paulo, and has garnered multiple awards including Best First Feature at Outfest and Best U.S. Latino FIlm at NY's Cinema Tropical while picking up Spirit Award and GLAAD nominations for Best First Feature Under 500k and the Piaget's Producer's Award. The film tells the coming-of-age story of two teen Chicanas in Huntington Park, California who form a relationship ignited by sexual attraction.\nGuerrero describes an attraction to speaking about “actual violence within silence,” taboo subjects that are not easily spoken about between parents and children.Guerrero also hoped that LGBT Latino audiences would see themselves validated by the film—much as Guerrero herself felt when, as an undergraduate student, she encountered the work of feminist Chicana writers Gloria Anzaldúa and Cherríe Moraga. \n\nIn an interview in 2012 at the Torino LGBTQI Film Festival, Guerrero stated that she felt connected to the story in \"Mosquita y Mari\" because she “wanted to stay true to her own coming of age experience of exploring her identity.  I feel at that age you’re a little more open to life and the people around you end up impacting you because of your openness. These early years are markers of who you will become later on.  That is very true of my life and I feel like my friendships, and that friendship in particular that inspired this movie, was the beginnings of my queer identity.” \n\nIn 2014, Guerrero announced her next project, \"Los Valientes\", about a young undocumented gay Latino man living in the U.S. \"Los Valientes\", slated to be Guerrero's second feature, has been awarded two grants by SFF/KRF, a 2014 Sundance Feature Film Development Grant and a 2013 Tribeca Narrative Grant, and was selected to participate in IFP's No Borders Market in 2014.\n\nMost of Guerrero’s film work has been centered around California, especially the San Francisco Bay Area where she grew up. Her first work not centered in California was the episode of \"Queen Sugar\" she directed, centered in Louisiana.\n\nIn 2017, Guerrero directed the Ava DuVernay produced \"Queen Sugar\" episode \"What Do I Care for Morning\" which aired as episode three in season two. DuVernay chose Guerrero for the directorial position because of her work \"Mosquita y Mari\".  Based off this film, DuVernay felt confident enough that Guerrero could focus on the power of intimacy, especially for \"Queen Sugar\", a show that focuses so much on family, betrayal and injustice. DuVernay had originally invited Guerrero to direct an episode of season one, but because Guerrero had just become a mother, she had to pass the opportunity. Prior to directing episode three of season two of \"Queen Sugar\", Guerrero had no idea what episode or what she was going to be directing specifically. Exploring the flirtation, tension, and budding romance of this episode is one of her strengths, and it was a perfect directorial fit for her.\n\nDuVernay later recommended Guerrero to Lin-Manuel Miranda to direct the music video for Andra Day's cover of \"Burn\" from \"The Hamilton Mixtape\".\n\nIn a blog post that she wrote on the Sundance Institute website on April 28, 2011 Guerrero writes, \"My first inspirations were writers. Women of color feminist writers like Audre Lorde, Cherrie Moraga, Gloria Anzaldúa, Chrystos, June Jordan, and Angela Davis. When I discovered their brave works as a freshman in college, a fierce creative seed was planted in me. It was a calling I had the moment I was stripped naked by their words.\" Fittingly, her work showcases the experiences of Chicanas that often echo her own experiences.\n\nIn an interview with El Tecolote on April 26, 2012 Guerrero stressed the importance of “opening doors to Latinos, especially women and youth, behind the camera in order to help build a community of Latina/o artists,” something she didn’t have when she was a girl. She also stresses the importance of activity in politics and cultural activism.\n\n\"Viernes Girl\", HBO/New York International Latino Film Festival (NYILFF) short script competition (2005)\n\"Mosquita y Mari\", John Cassavetes Spirit Award Nomination, (2013)\n\n\"Mosquita y Mari\", John Cassavetes Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay, (2013)\"Mosquita y Mari\", Best First Narrative Feature, Outfest (2012)\n\"Mosquita y Mari\", Best Narrative Feature, Festival Las Americas, Chicago (2012)\n\"Mosquita y Mari\", Best Narrative Feature, Cinefestival (2012)\n\"Mosquita y Mari\", Best Screenplay, Santa Fe Independent Film Festival (2012)\n\"Mosquita y Mari\", Queer Award, Torino International LGBT Film Festival (2012)\n\"Mosquita y Mari\", Audience Award, Pink Film Festival Zurich (2012)\nBest Director, awarded to Aurora Guerrero, Long Beach QFilm Festival (2012)\nGlobal Can Award, awarded to Aurora Guerrero, William & Mary Film Festival (2012)\n\nTime Warner/Sundance Storytelling Fellow (2012) \n\n\nMejia, Paula. “Ava DuVernay Only Wanted Female Directors for ‘Queen Sugar,’ Aurora Guerrero Stepped Up.” Remezcla.

He taught himself to paint and derives its name \"Painter\". (hence the name) and sculpt in academic art school style. He and his artist cousin Anandrao Painter between 1910 and 1916 were the leading painters of stage backdrops in Western India doing several famous curtains for Sangeet Natak troupes and also for Gujarati Parsi theatres. They became avid filmgoers following Raja Harishchandra.\n\nBaburao and his cousin Anandarao bought a movie projector from the Mumbai flea market and proceeded to exhibit films, studying the art of movies all the while. Anandarao was busy with assembling a camera for their maiden venture, and his untimely death at this juncture compelled Baburao to go it alone\n\nThey turned to cinema first as exhibitors while trying to assemble their own camera. Anandrao however died in 1916 and Painter and his main disciple V.G. Damle eventually put together a working camera in 1918.\n\nBaburao was one of the leading stage painter for theatres in Western India during the period of 1910 and 1916. He was also a film enthusiast and founded Maharashtra Film Company in 1919. To enable this Baburao borrowed money from Tanibai Kagolkar, a long-time admirer. Movie acting, especially tamasha's were looked down upon in conservative societies like Kolhapur so the studio itself was a living quarter for quite a few including leading ladies – Gulab Bai (renamed Kamaladevi) and Anusuya Bai (renamed Sushiladevi). Painter got onboard his old colleagues including Damle and S. Fatehlal and later on V. Shantaram, trio who later on left him to set up their own studio called Prabhat Film Company.\n\nBaburao's first feature film was Sairandri (1920), which got heavily censored for its graphic depiction of slaying of Keechak by Bhima. However the movie itself got positive critics and commercial acclaim spurring Painter on to take on more ambitious projects. He wrote his own screenplays, and led the three-dimensional space rather than stage-painting in the Indian movie. 1921/22, he published the first Indian films and programs designed to even the movie posters. Publicity was not alien to Painter's many talents – in 1921–22, he distributed programme booklets complete with photographs and film details.\n\nBaburao was a man of many talents – he wrote his own screenplays and he was also the first Indian filmmaker to adopt the method, Eisenstein had described as 'stenographic' – he sketched the costumes, movements, and characters. He changed the concept of set designing from painted curtains to solid multi-dimensional lived in spaces, he introduced artificial lighting and understood the importance of publicity. As early as 1921–22 he was the first to issue programme booklets, complete with details of the film and photographs. He also painted himself tasteful, eye-catching posters of his films.\n\nA perfectionist, he insisted upon any number of rehearsals. As Zunzarrao Pawar, a cast member, said '` He would take umpteen rehearsals before actual shooting...but he was very slow in film-making. That was why we used to get annoyed with him sometimes.'`\n\nThe advent of sound in 1931 did not excite Painter. However, after a few more silent films, the Maharashtra Film Company pulled down its shutters with the advent of sound. Baburao was not particularly keen on the talkies for he believed that they would destroy the visual culture so painfully evolved over the years.\n\nHe returned to painting and sculpture, his original vocation barring sporadic ventures like remaking Savkari Pash in sound in 1936, Pratibha (1937), one of his few preserved films which is a good illustration of Painter's control over big sets, lighting and crowd scenes and Lokshahir Ramjoshi (1947) on Shantaram's invitation.\n\nThe beautiful posters that Baburao painted for his films prompted the advice of not wasting his talent on \"dirty walls\", that an art gallery was the correct destination! Prophetic words indeed, because later his posters were up at J.J. School of Art, Mumbai and much admired by the principal, Gladstone Solomon.\n\n\nTogether, Sinhagad and Kalyan Khajina won a medal at the Wembley Exhibition, London. One newspaper, Daily Express, described the films as \"full of strangely wistful beauty, and acted with extraordinary grace.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

The building is the second largest in the Costa Brava, after the Girona Cathedral, and is big enough to justify a cathedral status. It is a Gothic building begun in the thirteenth century that replaced a primitive Romanesque church from the tenth century. A few vestiges of this building remains, such as the first floors of the bell tower and the grant baptismal. It was completed in the fifteenth century, when the marble facade and the alabaster altarpiece of the main altar were finished. It contains a museum known as \"El Tresor\", which contains a large collection of religious jewelry.\n\nThe church is dedicated to the Virgin of Candelera.\n\nAfter the destruction of Empúries, Castelló became the county seat, with the transfer of the Counts of Empúries to the villa. Thus the site became a strategically defensive zone surrounded by walls. The counts wanted the village to be the base of the episcopal seat of the Empordà, which would explain its monumentality.\n\nA document from 1007 first made mention of a Romanesque church dedicated to Santa Maria established in the hamlet of Castelló d'Empúries. This was a purchase made by the Bishop of Girona Odó, from spouses Tedmar and Truitela, a Castelló freehold property comprising several mounds, two lagoons and two lakes called \"Ded\" and \"Bona Conca\". The property was limited, at different points, by Sancta Maria de Castilione territories. This Romanesque church was consecrated in 1064.\n\nThe Catalan Gothic style structure, which was built in the same location as the first Romanesque church, was directed by the architect Ramón de Xartres, and construction began on 13 February 1261, during the time of Count Ponç IV of Empúries. Its architectural structure was finished early in the fifteenth century, when the facade was built, with the grand marble portal. The side altars were built and the alabaster altarpiece of the main altar was designed. It has the structure and dimensions of a cathedral, a status which it never attained despite several efforts spearheaded by the counts of Empúries.\n\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries two side chapels, the \"Puríssima Sang\" (Immaculate Heart) and \"Nostra Senyora dels Dolors\" (Our Lady of Sorrows), were added.\n\nBuilt with a hall church design, a method introduced to Spain by Cistercian monks, it is composed of three buildings, a wider central and two lateral ones. The laterals are unusual in that their height is different from the central plant in some sections.\n\nThe structure of the hall church is rectangular with framed side chapels between the buttresses, surmounted by drainage gargoyles, which support the side walls. In the header and in the first two sections, including the lower side aisles, the abutments are complemented by buttresses. Each of the three naves of the plant is made up of nine ogive vaults supported by pillars, with elements typical of this type of construction: rainbow arches and the four ribs that are joined at a keystone.\n\nThe large windows in the apse of the church were of stained glass. Today only one remains, the others were covered with sheets of translucent alabaster.\n\nThe high altar is a made of consecrated stone more than three meters long, supported by five columns, and it is used for services to celebrate mass. It had been placed in the chancel, on the other side of the iron gate, but in 1973 it was moved to its present location, closer to the faithfuls.\n\nThe front cover features a large main stone from the fifteenth century, attributed to master builder Antoni Antigó, and is divided into three sections: two bell towers and a central body. This central part has the portal, framed between two pinnacles. Its beauty consists of six archivolts which delimit the tympanum and the pediment. The \"Adoration of the Magi\" is represented in the tympanum. The six archivolts are topped by twelve niches that house the twelve apostles. All sculptures are carved with great perfection and attention to detail. Under the niches, there is a socket with blind windows resting on a bench. On top of the cover and occupying the top of the central body, there is a large Gothic rosette, which supplies light to the interior of the temple. The bell tower (from the twelfth or thirteenth) stands on the north side. It is a tower divided into five floors with a height of 36 meters that follows the architectural design of the Lombard influenced bell towers.\n"}

Versions were also made of metal, including castings with figurative designs, such as the Hurrian foundation pegs (Syria, c. 2300 – c. 2159 BCE).\n\nAdditionally, uninscribed clay cones painted in different colors were used by Sumerians to create decorative mosaic patterns on walls and pillars of buildings, which also offered some protection against weathering.\n\nThe similar funerary cones of ancient Egypt used the cone base as the major writing surface.\n\nAs some of the oldest 'documents' in history, the sponsor, responsible for the construction, or dedication of a work, some of the oldest histories, and/or intrigues are recorded. (Boasting sometimes led to historical inaccuracies, or misstatements of facts.)\n\nKing Entemena's nail is a prime example of a clay nail in excellent condition, as well as a detailed story. He was king of Lagash towards the late-middle of the 3rd millennium BC.\n\nOne of King Hammurabi's clay nails was acquired in March 1938 from an antique dealer. The nail, although fully preserved, is missing almost the entire shaft. The head has a diameter of 187 millimeters. In comparison, the shaft at the base is 110 millimeters in diameter. Both the head and shaft are inscribed with cuneiform writing in Akkadian. There are three columns of text on the head of the nail; the first column on the upper half having dulled over the course of centuries, and the lower half of the third column broken off. The clay nail bears the number A 24645 at the Oriental Institute, the University of Chicago's archaeology museum.\n\nThere are two replicas of the clay nail with the same inscription located at the University of Pennsylvania Museum and the Oxford Museum. However, each were transliterated and translated differently. The Philadelphia version is filled with missing text, although the complication was solved with the help of the Chicago version. Simultaneously, the Oxford text gives the Sumerian version. All three clay nails are now preserved in each of their respected locations. They are easily recognized to be from the Hammurabi period due to their distinct style of having a mushroom shape, broad heads, and short shafts.\n\n"}

The pieces are flat and thin, and collectively weigh under , indicating that they were probably intended as part of a necklace.\n\nThe hoard was discovered in 1945 by Hubert Lannon while cutting turf on his bog in Roscommon. From 1947, it was kept in a safe at Sheehan's Chemists in Strokestown, during which time it was only seen by members of the Sheehan family. Following a break-in at the pharmacy, in which the safe was stolen, the objects were found by the Garda Síochána (Irish police) wrapped in paper in a rubbish skip in April 2009. Due to its lightness in weight, police believe that the thieves were primarily interested in cash and were not aware of the objects' presence in the discarded loot.\n\nToday it is held by the National Museum of Ireland, where it is on permanent display. According to Mary Cahill of the museum, the objects are significant as the only extant \"association between the discs and the lunula, because the discs would be considered among the earliest gold ornaments and the lunula as coming a little bit later\". Of the estimated 100 European lunula known in Western Europe, some 80 originate in Ireland. In 2017 the three objects were featured on an Irish postal stamp, one of a series showing \"A History of Ireland in 100 Objects\".\n"}

{"id": "353880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=353880", "title": "Computer art", "text": "Computer art\n\nComputer art is any art in which computers play a role in production or display of the artwork. Such art can be an image, sound, animation, video, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, video game, website, algorithm, performance or gallery installation. Many traditional disciplines are now integrating digital technologies and, as a result, the lines between traditional works of art and new media works created using computers has been blurred. For instance, an artist may combine traditional painting with algorithm art and other digital techniques. As a result, defining computer art by its end product can thus be difficult. Computer art is bound to change over time since changes in technology and software directly affect what is possible.\n\nOn the title page of the magazine \"Computers and Automation\", January 1963, Edmund Berkeley published a picture by Efraim Arazi from 1962, coining for it the term \"computer art.\" This picture inspired him to initiate the first Computer Art Contest in 1963. The annual contest was a key point in the development of computer art up to the year 1973.\n\nThe precursor of computer art dates back to 1956–1958, with the generation of what is probably the first image of a human being on a computer screen, a (George Petty-inspired) pin-up girl at a SAGE air defense installation. Desmond Paul Henry invented the Henry Drawing Machine in 1960; his work was shown at the Reid Gallery in London in 1962, after his machine-generated art won him the privilege of a one-man exhibition.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, most individuals involved in the creation of computer art were in fact engineers and scientists because they had access to the only computing resources available at university scientific research labs. Many artists tentatively began to explore the emerging computing technology for use as a creative tool. In the summer of 1962, A. Michael Noll programmed a digital computer at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey to generate visual patterns solely for artistic purposes . His later computer-generated patterns simulated paintings by Piet Mondrian and Bridget Riley and became classics. Noll also used the patterns to investigate aesthetic preferences in the mid-1960s.\n\nThe two early exhibitions of computer art were held in 1965: Generative Computergrafik, February 1965, at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart, Germany, and Computer-Generated Pictures, April 1965, at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York. The Stuttgart exhibit featured work by Georg Nees; the New York exhibit featured works by Bela Julesz and A. Michael Noll and was reviewed as art by \"The New York Times\". A third exhibition was put up in November 1965 at Galerie Wendelin Niedlich in Stuttgart, Germany, showing works by Frieder Nake and Georg Nees. Analogue computer art by Maughan Mason along with digital computer art by Noll were exhibited at the AFIPS Fall Joint Computer Conference in Las Vegas toward the end of 1965.\n\nIn 1968, the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London hosted one of the most influential early exhibitions of computer art called Cybernetic Serendipity. The exhibition included many of whom often regarded as the first digital artists, Nam June Paik, Frieder Nake, Leslie Mezei, Georg Nees, A. Michael Noll, John Whitney, and Charles Csuri. One year later, the Computer Arts Society was founded, also in London.\n\nAt the time of the opening of Cybernetic Serendipity, in August 1968, a symposium was held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, under the title \"Computers and visual research\". It took up the European artists movement of New Tendencies that had led to three exhibitions (in 1961, 63, and 65) in Zagreb of concrete, kinetic, and constructive art as well as op art and conceptual art. New Tendencies changed its name to \"Tendencies\" and continued with more symposia, exhibitions, a competition, and an international journal (bit international) until 1973.\n\nKatherine Nash and Richard Williams published \"Computer Program for Artists: ART 1\" in 1970.\n\nXerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) designed the first Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the 1970s. The first Macintosh computer is released in 1984, since then the GUI became popular. Many graphic designers quickly accepted its capacity as a creative tool.\n\nFormerly, technology restricted output and print results: early machines used pen-and-ink plotters to produce basic hard copy.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the Stromberg Carlson SC-4020 microfilm printer was used at Bell Telephone Laboratories as a plotter to produce digital computer art and animation on 35-mm microfilm. Still images were drawn on the face plate of the cathode ray tube and automatically photographed. A series of still images were drawn to create a computer-animated movie, early on a roll of 35-mm film and then on 16-mm film as a 16-mm camera was later added to the SC-4020 printer.\n\nIn the 1970s, the dot matrix printer (which was much like a typewriter) was used to reproduce varied fonts and arbitrary graphics. The first animations were created by plotting all still frames sequentially on a stack of paper, with motion transfer to 16-mm film for projection. During the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix printers were used to produce most visual output while microfilm plotters were used for most early animation.\n\nIn 1976, the inkjet printer was invented with the increase in use of personal computers. The inkjet printer is now the cheapest and most versatile option for everyday digital color output. Raster Image Processing (RIP) is typically built into the printer or supplied as a software package for the computer; it is required to achieve the highest quality output. Basic inkjet devices do not feature RIP. Instead, they rely on graphic software to rasterize images. The laser printer, though more expensive than the inkjet, is another affordable output device available today.\n\nAdobe Systems, founded in 1982, developed the PostScript language and digital fonts, making drawing painting and image manipulation software popular. Adobe Illustrator, a vector drawing program based on the Bézier curve introduced in 1987 and Adobe Photoshop, written by brothers Thomas and John Knoll in 1990 were developed for use on MacIntosh computers, and compiled for DOS/Windows platforms by 1993.\n\nA \"robot painting\" is an artwork painted by a robot. It differs from other forms of printing that uses machinery such as offset printing and inkjet printing, in that the artwork is made up of actual brush strokes and artist grade paints. Many robot paintings are indistinguishable from artist created paintings.\n\nOne of the first robot painters was AARON, an artificial intelligence/artist developed by Professor Harold Cohen, UCSD, in the mid-1970s. Another pioneer in the field, Ken Goldberg of UC Berkeley created an 11' x 11' painting machine in 1992. Multiple other robotic painters exist though none are currently mass-produced.\n\nNon-photorealistic rendering (using computers to automatically transform images into stylized art) has been a subject of research since the 1990s. Around 2015, \"neural style transfer\" using convolutional neural networks to transfer the style of an artwork onto a photograph or other target image became feasible. One method of style transfer involves using a framework such as VGG or ResNet to break the artwork style down into statistics about visual features. The target photograph is subsequently modified to match those statistics. Notable applications include Prisma, Facebook Caffe2Go style transfer, MIT's Nightmare Machine, and DeepArt.\n\n\n"}

Bakhtin analysed François Rabelais' book \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\" and its portrayals of \"grotesque realism\" (i.e. celebrations of primary needs) and carnival in which social norms were subverted.\n\nThe Culture of Popular Laughter combines two literary ideas developed by Bakhtin in the same work: the idea of \"Grotesque body\" and \"Carnivalesque\" debauchery. It is distinguished from each, however, by its applications outside literary theory.\n\nThe idea of \"Carnivalesque\" was also created by Bakhtin and forms part of his wider theory of Popular Laughter. He argued that, during times of carnival such as the Feast of Fools, social norms were deliberately turned upside-down. The carnival then became a form of Safety-valve institution, which served a Structural-functionalist role to temporarily release stresses in the contemporary social system. Bakhtin, however, argued that this form of system was \"formalized\" in the culture of the period as \"popular laughter\".\n\nThe historian Gábor Klaniczay argued that the Culture of Popular Laughter stretched through all echelons of society and was certainly not restricted to the peasantry. Bakhtin's theory has also been credited with bringing about a scholarly reassessement of the importance of popular culture in history.\n\nThe Culture of Popular Laughter was originally formulated based on the writings of Rabelais, but has also been applied in the interpretation of peasant scenes painted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder and his descendants. The example has also been applied to Japanese society.\n"}

In the 19th and 20th centuries Russian art was the dominant influence. \n\nAmong the diversity of monuments of the historical past, a prominent place belongs to the art of the ancient man - engravings and paintings on the rocks. On the territory of Kazakhstan, the first type of these monuments is especially common, petroglyphs - drawings on the rocks, embossed with stone or metal tools. Due to the absence of anthropogenic impact on most of the territory of Kazakhstan, many monuments have been preserved, which are studied by experts. The specifics of the Kazakhstan relief and the peculiarities of the rocks that make up the mountain ranges cause widespread of petroglyphs.\n\nThe first examples of fine art in Kazakhstan belong to the Paleolithic era. They are found in the mountains of Karatau and Hantau in the form of images of animals carved on the rocks. Petroglyphs of the Neolithic and Bronze Age in the Bayanaulsky cave (Pavlodar region), in the Tanbaly gorge (Almaty region) (on the images - elk, lion, hunter with a bow, ox, harnessed to a cart, cow, etc.) and drawings on the stones of the north the shores of Lake Balkash (a duel between two men with sabers, next to which a girl stands, and others) give an idea of the main occupations and customs of the tribes inhabiting the Kazakh land.\n\nOne of the most ancient and vivid monuments of the Semirechie rock art is the petroglyphs of the Tamgaly archaeological complex, located 170 km north-west of the city of Almaty in the Anrakai Mountains. Petroglyphs were discovered in 1957 by an archaeological expedition of the Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences under the direction of A. G. Maximova. There was a sanctuary with a large number of cave paintings. Its study began in the 1970-1980s. Most petroglyphs are located in the lower part of the main gorge and in the side of the gorge adjacent to it from the west. Here you can see about 2000 rock paintings. \n\nThe themes of the drawings are very diverse: people, animals, horsemen, scenes of hunting people, scenes of hunting predatory animals, scenes from people's lives, ritual dances, sun-headed deities, as well as multi-figure compositions depicting people and animals, scenes of hunting animals and scenes of bull sacrifice. The most common images are drawings of horses, deers and eagles. Deers are symbols of power and beauty and eagle represent sky and immortality in the Kazakh art.\n\nIn the Bronze Age the area of modern Kazakhstan was inhabited by people of the Andronovo culture, with the Begazy-Dandybai culture is southern parts. In the Andronovo culture there was exploitation of metal ores, including gold, and probably silver, as well as copper. In places this was on a large scale. Although significant survivals are very rare, it is clear that textiles, mostly in wool, were in general use for clothing, along with leather and fur. Clothing was often richly decorated with metal and stone jewellery. By the Iron Age, Greek descriptions of steppe nomad dress survive, and Greek and Persian depictions of related steppes peoples.\n\nIn the first millennium BC, the territory of present-day Kazakhstan in the area of the Ili River belonged to the Sakas tribes, whose works of art formed part of the wider tradition of Scythian art from across the whole Eurasian steppe. Most survivals have come from kurgan burial mounds. The most famous discovery of the Sakas era is the \"Golden Man\" - the costume of a wealthy Saka man or woman, decorated with gold chased plates. \"Golden Man\" was found in the Issyk kurgan (burial mound) in south-eastern Kazakhstan near Almaty city in 1969. Most of the armor, boots and hat are decorated with many gold plates, which makes the found object resemble a statue made of precious metal. Most of the jewelry found was made of gold by casting, stamping, embossing and engraving in the form of a circular sculpture, high relief and bas-relief. \n\nThe head is crowned with a hat in the form of a high peaked turban, decorated with golden plates depicting horses, snow leopards, birds and trees with spreading crowns. The neck is decorated with a golden hoop with tips in the form of tiger heads. In the lobe of the left ear, the \"Golden Man\" wore a gold earring with a turquoise ornament. To the right of the belt, a sword in a sheath covered with red leather is attached, and an iron dagger in the sheath with gold overlays in the form of a galloping moose and a horse is suspended on the left. On both sides of the dagger on the gold plates are carved figures of wolf, fox, mountain sheep, fallow deer, fox, snake and other animals. The tall hat compares with the tall saukele head-dress that is today part of the traditional wedding costume for Kazakh women. \n\nThe treasures of the Issyk mound, including an exact copy of the \"Golden Man\", were exhibited at the Kazakh Museum of Archeology, located in Almaty, and are now at the State Museum of Gold and Precious Metals of the Republic of Kazakhstan in Astana.\n\nThe \"golden man\" on the winged leopard became one of the main symbols of Kazakhstan.\n\nMany \"balbals\" or kurgan stelae, monoliths shaped as a human figure, have been found topping kurgans, or surrounding them in groups.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, in the territory of modern Kazakhstan various states successively replaced each other, trade was actively carried out within the Great Silk Road, which enriched the culture of the people who lived here with new techniques of art and, in general, influenced the spheres of application of the creative potential of local artists. \n\nThe centres of culture, religion, trade, the connection between agricultural oases and nomadic steppe, between East and West on the Great Silk Road were cities in the valleys of the rivers Syrdarya, Talas, Chu, Ili - Isfidzhab, Yangikent, Suyab, Kayalyk Mirki, Kulan.\n\nThe centers of culture, science and art of the Middle Ages were the cities of Otrar, Taraz, Balasagun, Sygnak, Sauran and many others. The mausoleums of Babaji-Khatun (X-XI centuries), Aisha-Bibi (XI-XII centuries), Alash-khan (XII-XIV centuries), Dzhuchi-khan (XIII century), mausoleum of  Kozy-Korpesh and Bayan-Slu (VIII – X centuries) and the tower of Tamerlane (XIV century) are considered to be unique architectural monuments of this time. Of the monuments located in the south of Kazakhstan, the Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yassavi in the city of Turkestan stands out for its monumentality, consisting of a whole complex of premises and one of the largest architectural monuments of Central Asia and Kazakhstan. The mausoleum was built by order of Timur (XIV century) in honor of the preacher Yassavi. The mausoleum was built of burnt bricks and laid out inside and out with multi-colored tiles of blue and white, decorated with carved and type-setting mosaic, painted majolica. A huge cauldron-cauldron located in a mausoleum of great artistic value, cast from an alloy of seven metals, can now be seen in the State Hermitage Museum.\n\nIn the XIV-XV centuries, great progress was made in the use of structures such as arches, vaults, domes. Particular attention was paid to the quality of bricks, which mostly had a square shape. One side of the brick was painted blue, blue, white or green. Therefore, such a brick was laid for cladding simultaneously with the laying of external walls. Polychrome majolica tiles were also used in the decoration of the walls. In the interiors began to use murals, relief ornaments. Applied art was widely used in the construction of the mausoleums of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi, Kok-Kesen and Alash Khan. Medieval builders attached great importance to the quality of the building material: already at that time, brick and glazed paint of particular strength were made.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, such types of applied art as weaving carpets and pottery became widespread in Kazakhstan. The carpets, richly decorated with national patterns, served both to adorn the dwellings of the Kazakhs and to protect them from the weather and cold.\n\nOften found patterns of carpets, household items and kitchen utensils are floral patterns, hunting scenes, folk games, as well as images of animals and birds. The image of horses as the central part of the fine art is found everywhere throughout Kazakhstan. The horse personifies the beauty and power in the art of the Kazakhs. Also, horses were very important as a vehicle, especially in wartime. Horses were also sacrificed to gods and buried alongside warriors in burial mounds.\n\nAlso, pottery items were often decorated with inscriptions in different languages - Turkic, Uigur, Sogdian and others. One example of such art is the ceramic inscriptions found in the archaeological city of Aktobe, located in the middle reaches of the Chu River. Many inscriptions found on this ceramics date back to the 9th-11th centuries.\n\nFine art in its classical sense has been developed in Kazakhstan since the 19th century. The impetus to the beginning of such a development was the work of Russian artists who committed expeditions to Central Asia, and portrayed on their canvases those images and paintings that were born to them here: Vasily Vereshchagin, Nikolai Khludov. The latter had a special influence on the formation of the local school of painting, becoming a teacher of many local artists. The most famous among them is Abilkhan Kasteyev, whose name is now called the State Museum of Art of Kazakhstan.\n\nIn full, the Kazakh school of art was formed by the 40s of the twentieth century, and in the 50s it flourished. Local painters, graphic artists, sculptors, who received education as part of the unified Soviet system of preparing artists, began to actively create, often using national motifs in their work. The names of such painters as O. Tansykbaev, J. Shardenov, K. Telzhanov, S. Aitbaev, graphic artists E. Sidorkina, A. Duzelkhanov, sculptors H. Nauryzbaeva, E. Sergebaeva today make up the pride of Kazakhstani art.\n\nAt the end of the 80s, an avant-garde direction was formed in Kazakhstan, aimed at finding fresh ideas and protest against established forms and images in the art. In Kazakhstan painting various plastic principles began to appear, such as in the works of B. Tulkeev - super-complex psychological compositions, A. Sydykhanov - mystical graphic compositions, A. Akanaeva - improvised compositions, like Picasso, D. Aliyev - chaotic figurative solutions. The paintings by K. Duisenbaev are filled with expressive formalism, reflecting the inner forces of nature and the human soul through a pictorially plastic form. K. Akhmetzhanov's canvases display the surrounding reality through pieces of color, \"optically\" collecting them into a picture of the world. In the works of A. Menlibayev, E. Ghazaryan there is a revival of interest in the folklore, ornamental style, taken from different temporal, spatial and cultural layers of history and traditions.Mythological symbolism is a significant phenomenon of modern art in Kazakhstan, which is expressed in the visual searches of artists Gulnara Kasmalieva's and Muratbek Djumaliev's \"TransSiberian Amazons\" (2005) and multi-channel video art \"A New Silk Road: Algorithm of Survival and Hope” (2007), performance and photography of Victor and Elena Vorobievs “(Non)Silk Road” (2006).\nSince Kazakhstan gained independence, there have been cardinal changes in all spheres: political, economic, social and art. One of the famous sculptural and architectural complexes of Modern Art is the Independence Monument in Almaty (sculptors A.Zhumabaev, N.Dalbai, architect Sh.Valihanov) and the monument to Ablaykhan in Astana (sculptor N. Dalbai, architect Sh. Valikhanov) made a considerable contribution to the approval of the idea of independence of Kazakhstan. The architectural-sculptural complex of the equestrian monument Isatay Taimanov and Makhambet Utemisov in Atyrau (sculptor B.Abishev and E.Sergebaev) can be called a phenomenon of modern monumental sculpture of Kazakhstan. The square with the monument to Sultan Beibars in Atyrau (sculptor K. Kakimov) became a beautiful laconic and expressive.\n\nThe Independence Monument, erected on the main square of Almaty, has become a symbol of the country, independence, a metaphor of the unity of the past, present and future of Kazakh history, culture and statehood. The granite stela directed upwards was crowned with a statue of a young warrior, stylized in the image of a famous \"Golden Man\". At his feet is a formidable winged mythical leopard. Attention to the richest cultural heritage of the Kazakhs, its skillful transformation in new forms made the Monument of Independence a phenomenon of national scope and marked the beginning of a wide search in this direction. The Independence Monument, created by the team led by the architect Sh. Valihanov, is a large-scale and monumental, and at the same time syncretic, artistic genre. Accurate understanding of the laws of this genre, coupled with the inherent Sh. Valihanovu ability to synthesize ideas, the ability to organically link purely traditional, national elements with the achievements of world aesthetic and urban planning thought helped in the end to create a monument grandiose in design and embodiment.\n\nThere are more than 170 museums in Kazakhstan. The oldest museum in Kazakhstan - Semipalatinsk Museum of History and Local Lore - was built in 1883. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "12742567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12742567", "title": "Krämerbrücke", "text": "Krämerbrücke\n\nThe Krämerbrücke (Merchants' bridge) is a medieval arch bridge in the city of Erfurt, in Thuringia in central Germany, which is lined with half timbered shops and houses on both sides of a cobblestone street. It is one of the few remaining bridges in the world that have inhabited buildings. It has been continuously inhabited for over 500 years, longer than any other bridge in Europe. The stone, pedestrian bridge, which dates from 1325, is one of the oldest secular structures in Erfurt. It spans the Breitstrom, a branch of Gera River, and connects two town squares - Benediktsplatz and Wenigemarkt.\n\nFrom end to end, the Krämerbrücke is 125 m long in total. The stone bridge, which was built in 1325, is constructed from limestone and sandstone, and has six visible barrel arches ranging from 5.5 to 8 m wide. The section of the bridge supported by the six arches is 79 m long. Wooden stalls were built on top of the stone-bridge for trading goods.\n\nThe bridge originally had stone churches at both ends, where gated entrances were erected - St. Benedict's Church at the western end and St Ägidien's Church at the eastern end. St Ägidien's Church, the only one of the two that still exists, was previously a bridge chapel. The chapel was first mentioned in 1110. The archway of the church, via which the Krämerbrücke can be entered, is 3.75 m wide and 3.25 m high.\n\nThe construction of the houses on the Krämerbrücke was completed in 1486, following a fire in 1472 which destroyed nearly half of the city and the market stalls on the stone bridge. Sixty-two timber framed buildings were built on each side of the stone bridge, creating a street between the two rows. Later, the small houses were gradually merged, so that there are now 32 houses on the bridge. They have shops on the ground floor and living accommodation above. They are the longest rows of inhabited buildings on any bridge in Europe. \n\nThe three-storey houses are 13 m to 15 m in height. To make them habitable, the width of the bridge was extended by using wooden \"Sprengwerke\" (trusses or bracing) next to the arched vaults, so that the buildings partially overhang the stone bridge structure. The total width of the bridge, as completed in 1486, is 26 m. The road between the two rows of buildings is 5.5 m wide.\n\nThe bridge was part of the Via Regia, a medieval trade and pilgrims' road network, which linked Rome with the Baltic Sea, and Moscow with Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain. The Krämerbrücke is on the route from the river Rhine to Silesia.. It is also on one of the main routes of the Camino de Santiago, the Way of St. James pilgrimage. Erfurt was at a major crossroads of the Via Regia and it became an important trading centre in the Middle Ages. It was a member of the Hanseatic League.\n\nA wooden bridge was built at sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries at the same river ford as the present day Krämerbrücke. The bridge was first mentioned in 1117 after its destruction by one of many fires.\n\nThe first written evidence of a “pons rerum venalium”, i.e. \"a market bridge\", on the site dates back to 1156. Merchants and trades people had already set up market stalls on both sides of the bridge by this date. The name \"Krämerbrücke\", which means \"merchants' bridge\", has been in common usage since 1510.\n\nThere were repeated fires on the wooden bridge in 1175, 1178, 1213, 1222, 1245, 1265, and 1293. The idea of building a stone bridge was discussed after the 1265 fire and in 1293 the municipal administration acquired all bridge rights from the monasteries, who traded goods on the bridge. However, the stone bridge wasn't completed until 1325. \n\nFor about the first hundred years following the stone bridge`s construction, mainly local produce was sold in its stalls. There were a number of important monasteries in Erfurt, including St Augustine's, where Martin Luther was later a monk; the Dominican Prediger Monastery where the mystic Meister Eckhart (c. 1260 - 1328) was the prior; and the Benedictine monastery of St Peter and Paul, which was on the hill where Petersberg Citadel now stands. These continued to have stalls on the bridge, selling \"Apoteki\", such as herbs for healing and culinary use, wine and vegetables.\n\nLater, goods such as paper, goldsmiths' work, silk, spices and oriental perfumes such as frankincense from places up to 7000 km away were sold on the bridge, and the locally produced woad, a valuable and important dye for which Erfurt was renowned, was sold to traders who took it across Europe.\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, after the current half-timbered houses had been built, trades people such as toymakers, furriers, passementerie makers and leather tanners began to operate from the workshops on the bridge. \n\nIn 1624 the city council gave permission for street musicians to play on and around the bridge, with flutes, fiddles, trumpets, crumhorns and pommers. Street musicians still play on the bridge today; both traditional music and contemporary bands are an important part of the annual \"Krämerbrückenfest\".\n\nSt. Benedict's Church at the west end of the bridge was sold in 1807 and later demolished, apart from its tower, in 1810, in order to build a new house. In 1895 the tower was also demolished to enable the construction of the Rathausbrücke (town hall bridge), which crosses the river parallel to the Krämerbrücke on its south side. When the Rathausbrücke was being planned, the idea of completely demolishing the Krämerbrücke was discussed.\n\nIn 1945, house numbers 11 to 14 were damaged in an allied air raid, with number 12 being completely destroyed. The buildings were reconstructed in 1954.\n\nAn extensive restoration of the whole bridge structure, including the arched vaults, was carried out by the East German government in 1985 and 1986. Since then, vehicles up to a weight of 11 tons have been allowed to use the bridge, although it remains essentially a pedestrian bridge, with only small delivery and maintenance vehicles accessing it at restricted times.\n\nSince 1990 the bridge has been under continual maintenance. Over 1 million Euro has been spent on it.\n\nThe bridge is still an important thoroughfare for local residents, as well as being one of Erfurt's main tourist sites. It is still in much the same use as it has been for over 500 years.\n\nAbout 80 people live on the Krämerbrücke. The shops at street level house businesses such as artisans' workshops, specialist food outlets, antique shops, wine merchants, art galleries, cafes, etc. A bakery operates at the western end of the bridge. The upper levels of the buildings are mainly inhabited homes. Except for the buildings numbered 15, 20, 24 and 33, all the other buildings on the bridge are municipal property. \n\nIn medieval times buildings were not numbered and many people were illiterate, so house signs were sometimes hung on buildings or placed over doorways, so that the house and its occupants could be easily located. Examples of these can still be seen on the bridge, as well as original doors which may be hundreds of years old.\n\nThe \"Stiftung Krämerbrücke\" (Krämerbrücke Foundation) was founded in 1996 by the city council. It is responsible for maintaining the bridge and promoting its history. The foundation strictly controls what type of businesses can operate from the bridge to ensure that it remains in keeping with its historical roots. In the “Haus der Stiftung” (Krämerbrücke 31), there is a permanent exhibition about the history of the bridge. The information centre also provides information on the organisations that ensure that the bridge is properly looked after; these are: \n\nThe \"Krämerbrückenfest\" is an important festival in Erfurt, attracting about 130,000 visitors. The three-day festival has been held in the third week of June annually since 1975. It is a celebration of the bridge and the culture of the Middle Ages. The festival is officially opened by an actor playing the folkloric character Till Eulenspiegel, who according to legend visited Erfurt and fooled the professors at the university that he had taught a donkey to read.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1984, Haruomi Hosono released the first generally recognized video game soundtrack album, \"Video Game Music\", and the practice experienced its \"golden age\" in the mid-to-late 1980s with hundreds of releases including Buckner & Garcia's \"Pac-Man Fever\", Namco's \"Video Game Graffiti\", and Koichi Sugiyama's orchestral covers of the \"Dragon Quest\" series. The 1990s saw many fewer commercial releases and a shift to promo releases with increasing use of video game samples in rap and hip hop.\n\nThe trend away from vinyl discs continued in the 2000s as fan-made remixes also began to be produced, however by the 2010s the trend reversed and the practice of producing video game soundtracks on vinyl experienced a revival. The vinyl revival of the 2010s has itself been attributed to inspiration in younger music buyers from video games, and it has led to the establishment of video game soundtrack oriented vinyl record labels like Black Screen Records, Data Discs, Brave Wave, and iam8bit, and shifts toward similar releases for labels like Ghost Ramp, Ship To Shore Phonograph Co., and Mondo Tees. In a 2015 article, music journalist Mike Diver suggested that \"this scene within a scene is experiencing boom times\", however he noted that some in the music industry, including Invada manager Redg Weeks, were concerned by the risk of over-saturation of the market. These concerns were later repeated by Jamie Crook of Data Discs, and although he has joined Mondo's Mo Shafeek in arguing that the vinyl medium itself and the related revival is in no way a fad or bubble, in 2017 \"Kotaku\" reported concerns from dedicated video game soundtrack labels that pressing plants were scheduling their manufacturing runs last in order to favor traditional labels.\n\nThe 2000s-2010s revival of interest in this medium has been characterized by releases in limited numbers and promotional albums only available at special events or as pre-order bonuses. In addition, the practice has been adopted by the cult and Indie game scenes, with its proponents citing audio quality, interactivity, artwork, nostalgia, unique content, and the fact that vinyl albums represent tangible aspects of intangible (digitally distributed) products as key elements to what makes vinyl soundtrack albums attractive. Additional considerations for collectors include archival and preservation aspects for older games, examination and recontextualization of the music as a means to expand or further explore the game, and curiosity among audiophiles unfamiliar with video gaming music as a genre. Due to the limited nature of modern releases, many albums are considered highly collectible, with some regularly selling in excess of $100 USD. For Western collectors, additional difficulty is imposed by the cost of importing albums from Japan where the majority were produced during the \"golden age\" of the 1980s.\n\nThe use of grooved vinyl discs as a sequenced/encoded rather than recorded data storage medium enabled the code of full motion videos (FMVs) and even simple video games to be stored in an analog format along with the soundtrack and sound effects. These vinyl data discs took two forms: the FMV-only Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED), and the program sheet. Uncommon even in the early 1980s when the practice was at its height, program sheet game data required that users record from the disc (typically a flexi disc like the \"Interface Age\" \"Floppy ROM\") onto an audio cassette tape which could then be used via the cassette port with microcomputers such as the BBC Micro, Commodore 64, Commodore PET, Commodore VIC-20, Dragon 32/64, ZX81, or ZX Spectrum. The use of CEDs to store video game FMV data was even less common, and required the game console (typically an arcade machine) to select a section of the grooved track to read with its stylus at just the right time for the video to be displayed. The numerous limitations of these techniques (background noise, scratches, and other audio-fidelity problems) contributed to their failure to receive widespread acceptance and video game data stored in this manner remains some of the most difficult to archive and preserve.\n\n"}

It was the country's first fashion house. Maskit produces textiles, clothing, objets d’art and jewelry.\n\nThe Hebrew word \"maskit,\" meaning an ornament, or something small and beautiful, appears in the Bible 14 times.\n\nIn the early years of the state, when the government was seeking work opportunities for new immigrants to Israel, Ruth Dayan realized that many of them were skilled in decorative arts such as embroidery, rugs, and arts and crafts. The concept of Maskit, which Dayan founded in 1954, was to take modern European patterns and combine them with ethnic embroidery.\n\nIn 1955, Dayan met fashion designer Finy Leitersdorf, who designed clothes and accessories for Maskit over a period of 15 years. The two collaborated on a joint exhibit of Maskit designs at the Dizengoff Museum (today the Tel Aviv Museum). \n\nIn an interview in 1966, Leitersdorf spoke about the \"Israeliness\" of Maskit clothing. It was not just the Yemenite embroidery, she said, but the \"range of colors - the desert brown, the impure black inspired by Bedouin tents, and the eternally changing blue of the Mediterranean.\" She also cited the loose design, which made life more comfortable in the country's hot climate.\n\nMaskit enjoyed worldwide success in the 1960s, with clients that included Audrey Hepburn.

{"id": "7843148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7843148", "title": "Micromosaic", "text": "Micromosaic\n\nMicromosaics (or micro mosaics, micro-mosaics) are a special form of mosaic that uses unusually small mosaic pieces (tesserae) of glass, or in later Italian pieces an enamel-like material, to make small figurative images. Surviving ancient Roman mosaics include some very finely worked panels using very small tesserae, especially from Pompeii, but only from Byzantine art are there mosaic icons in micromosaic with tesserae as small as the best from the Modern period. Byzantine examples, which are very rare, were religious icons. The best known shows the Twelve Great Feasts of the Greek Orthodox Church and is in the Bargello in Florence. Another is in Rome and was crucial in developing the iconography of the Man of Sorrows in the West.\n\nFrom the Renaissance they began to be made in Italy, reaching the height of their popularity in the mid 19th century, when Rome was the centre of production; there was a Vatican Mosaic Studio from 1576, set up to create mosaic replicas of the altarpieces in St Peter's Basilica, which were being damaged by the humid conditions of the vast and crowded interior. They were popular purchases by visitors on the Grand Tour, easily portable, and often taken home to set into an object there. Typical scenes were landscapes of Roman views, rarely of any artistic originality, and the micromosaics were small panels used to inset into furniture or onto snuffboxes and similar objects, or for jewellery. Religious subjects were copied from paintings. The very smallest mosaic pieces come from works from the period between the late 18th century and the end of the 19th. Fortunato Pio Castellani (1794–1865) expanded the range of subjects in his work in the \"archeological style\", copying Roman and Early Christian wall-mosaics. It was even imitated by porcelain painters, who painted faint lines across their work to suggest the edges of tesserae. Butterfly scales and Diatoms were also used to create tesserae, Henry Dalton (1829-1911) of Bury St Edmunds being a well known practitioner.\n\nA distinctive feature of micromosaics is that the tesserae are usually oblong rather than square. The best work can achieve 3,000 to 5,000 tesserae per square inch. The best collections are in the Hermitage Museum and the Gilbert Collection in London. Asia has produced a number of contemporary examples using modern precision machinery to produce the diminutive elements.\n\nWearing micromosaic jewelry became popular during the Grand Tour period (17th - 19th Century). Members of rich European families would travel around Europe, taking in the sights and cultures of different countries. Italy was a very popular tourist spot as it had a long and prestigious history in arts and culture - a favourite subject in aristocratic circles. It was also a famous glass producer, and canny Italian craftsmen quickly turned their glass making skills to making stunning miniature micromosaic pictures for their rich visitors.\n\nMosaic work jewellery of this period usually depicted famous Italian landmarks such as the Colosseum and St. Peter's Basilica, though occasionally Roman mythology was a subject too. The richest tourists would commission their own mosaics, with animals and famous works of art being favourite subjects. The small size of the micromosaic was appealing; micro mosaics could be worn on the Grand Tourists' continuing journey, or sent back home to loved ones as a kind of fore-runner to modern postcards.\n\nRather than being sold in Italy many micromosaics were exported to jewelers in London and Paris to be set into larger pieces.\n\nMicromosaic jewelry fell out of fashion in the 1870s.\n\n\n"}

Bienstock, Inc. is one of the largest and most powerful television talent agencies in the United States, representing more than 600 television personalities. Consistently ranked among the Top 10 of TV's most powerful, the group represents clients ranging from Dan Rather and Chris Matthews to Anderson Cooper and Bill O'Reilly.\n\nBienstock is the largest specialized agency, with more assets devoted to news and reality-based programming than any others. Variety claims the company has a \"virtual monopoly on the news biz's biggest stars\" and the president of MSNBC told the New York Times that, \"They have a disproportionate share of America's news talent.\nUnited Talent Agency acquired N.S. Bienstock on 22nd Jan 2014.\"\n\nThe company began in the 1940s as the small, New York City life insurance business of Nate Bienstock, whose client list included a number of journalists, including Walter Cronkite, Charles Collingwood and Eric Sevareid. He sold a policy to the author John Steinbeck, who had Richard Leibner's father, Sol, as an accountant. Mr. Bienstock invited Sol Leibner into his business in 1964 and eventually sold out to him.\n\nAt the time, TV news was taking off, and Mr. Bienstock's newspaper and news agency clients were in demand at the networks. They asked for his help as they negotiated their contracts. Richard Leibner—not long out of New York University's business school—took up that part of the business and built it.\n\nHis wife and partner, Carole Cooper, whom he met on a blind date in 1962 and married in 1964, left her career as a producer of commercials to join the firm and become an agent in 1976. The firm also includes their sons, Adam and Jonathan.\n\nBut Mr. Leibner is the face of the company, perhaps best known for beginning the trend of big news salaries in the 1980s by playing the networks against one another and getting big deals for Dan Rather and Diane Sawyer. (The two now make more than $7 million and $10 million, respectively.) In the process, he has been accused of transforming journalists into something closer to Hollywood celebrities.\n\nThe agency has been at the forefront of the broadcast news business since 1964, pioneering representation of on-air and off-air talent in syndication, cable, reality television, and talk radio over the last 40+ years.

At the age of fourteen, he was apprenticed to a master decorative painter and began to take drawing lessons at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Later, he took private lessons from J.L. Lund. \n\nHe had originally planned to make lithography his career but, after a successful showing at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1827, he turned to sculpture and received some orders, including one for reliefs in a hall at Christiansborg. In 1830, he was awarded a small gold medal for his relief of Christ healing the sick, which is now displayed in Kongens Nytorv.\n\nAlthough the fees for these commissions were substantial, portrait busts were his primary source of income. His failure to win any more official recognition for his work soon prompted him to turn to painting. He held his first exhibition in 1833, after some very brief training. His painting of a wounded soldier brought him some prize money and was quickly purchased. It was later widely reproduced; notably in an engraving by .\n\nBy 1834, having failed to reproduce this initial success, he requested a loan from Privy Councilor , who had recently bought an altarpiece Simonsen had been unable to sell after those who ordered it changed their minds. The loan was given and it enabled him to spend two years in Munich, where he came under the influence of the Academy of Fine Arts and developed friendships with the artists there.\n\nHe soon found buyers for his work; landowners and businessmen as well as foreign art collectors. By 1837, he was sufficiently well-off to send home for his fiancée and get married. Over the next few years, he travelled to Tyrol, Northern Italy and Algiers. The resulting works were purchased by the royal families of Bavaria and Württemberg and the Royal Collection in Copenhagen.\n\nIn 1842, he became a member of the Munich Academy and was offered a professorship, but chose to take a similar offer from King Christian VIII and returned home; teaching military history painting at the Royal Academy. He also continued with his private career and the exotic works derived from his visit to North Africa were especially popular.\n\nFrom 1848 to 1851, during the First Schleswig War, he concentrated on large canvases of military scenes, several of which were acquired for the Royal Collection. After that, he went back to genre scenes, took a trip to Sweden and created a major work symbolizing the reconciliation of Denmark and Sweden after years of bitter contention for the island of Scania (\"Trolovelse i Skaane\"). \n\nIn 1852, he was named a Knight in the Order of the Dannebrog and, From 1854 to 1883, he was a teacher at the Academys' Model School. He once again focused on battle painting during the Second Schleswig War and became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts.

{"id": "1519272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1519272", "title": "Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime", "text": "Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime\n\nObservations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime () is a 1764 book by Immanuel Kant.\n\nThe first complete translation into English was published in 1799. The second, by John T. Goldthwait, was published in 1960 by the University of California Press.\n\n\"Of the Distinct Objects of the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime\"\n\nKant states that feelings of enjoyment are subjective. In this book, he describes his observations. His interest is not in coarse, thoughtless feelings or in the other extreme, the finest feelings of intellectual discovery. Instead, he writes about the finer feelings, which are intermediate. These require some sensitivity, intellectual excellence, talent, or virtue.\n\nThere are two kinds of finer feeling: the feeling of the sublime and the feeling of the beautiful. Kant gives examples of these pleasant feelings. Some of his examples of feelings of the beautiful are the sight of flower beds, grazing flocks, and daylight. Feelings of the sublime are the result of seeing mountain peaks, raging storms, and night.\n\nIn this section, Kant gives many particular examples of feelings of the beautiful and the sublime. Feelings of the beautiful \"occasion a pleasant sensation but one that is joyous and smiling.\" On the other hand, feelings of the sublime \"arouse enjoyment but with horror.\"\n\nKant subdivided the sublime into three kinds. The feeling of the terrifying sublime is sometimes accompanied with a certain dread or melancholy. The feeling of the noble sublime is quiet wonder. Feelings of the splendid sublime are pervaded with beauty.\n\n\"Of the Attributes of the Beautiful and Sublime in Man in General\"\n\nKant described the relationship between these finer feelings and humanity. The feelings are not totally separate from each other. Beauty and the sublime can be joined or alternated. Kant claimed that tragedy, for the most part, stirs the feeling of the sublime. Comedy arouses feelings for beauty. The personal appearance of humans prompts these feelings in various cases. A person's social position also affects these feelings.\n\nHuman nature has many variations of the feelings of the beautiful and the sublime. Some variations of the terrifying sublime are the adventurous and grotesque. Visionaries and cranks are persons who have fantasies and whims. The beautiful, when it degenerates, produces triflers, fops, dandies, chatterers, silliness, bores, and fools.\n\nSympathy or compassion and also good-natured agreeableness are not true virtues, according to Kant. True virtue is the quality of raising the feeling of humanity's beauty and dignity to a principle. When a person acts in accordance with this principle, regardless of inclination, that person is truly and sublimely virtuous.\n\n\"A profound feeling for the beauty and dignity of human nature and a firmness and determination of the mind to refer all one's actions to this as to a universal ground is earnest, and does not at all join with a changeable gaiety nor with the inconstancy of a frivolous person.\" With this observation, Kant will attempt to fit the various feelings of the beautiful and sublime, and the resulting moral characters, into Galen's rigid arrangement of the four humours or human temperaments: melancholic, sanguine, choleric, and phlegmatic.\n\nKant asserted that the human temperaments or dispositions are fixed and separate characters. An individual who has one frame of mind has no feeling or sense for the finer feelings that occur in a person of another temperament. \nAs a whole, human nature in general is a combination of these virtues. As such, it is a splendid expression of beauty and dignity.\n\n\"Of the Distinction of the Beautiful and Sublime in the Interrelations of the Two Sexes\"\n\nIn Section Three, Kant asserts that women predominantly have feelings for all that is beautiful. Men, on the contrary, have mostly feelings for the sublime. Any other feelings that are only for the enhancement of the main feeling. Kant admits, though, that the distinction is not absolute. Since \"we are dealing with human beings; we must also remember that they are not all alike.\"\n\nKant helps to root notions of inequality in the Western social structure. For example, Kant argues that \"a woman is little embarrassed that she does not possess high insights; she is beautiful and captivates, and that is enough ... Laborious learning or painful pondering, even if a woman should greatly succeed in it, destroys the merits that are proper to her sex.\"\n\nWomen's mental ability and understanding, then, refer to the beautiful. Men's deep, noble understanding is not suitable for women. Women have beautiful virtues such as kindness and benevolence. Men's virtue is noble and has to do with principles and duty. Because a woman is concerned with the beautiful, the worst that can be said against her is that she is disgusting. A man's greatest defect, however, would be that he is ridiculous, as this is the opposite of the sublime.\n\nIn sexual selection, a woman demands that the man have noble and sublime characteristics. A man wants a woman to possess beautiful qualities. In a marriage, the husband and wife unite their disparate attributes to form, as it were, a single moral person. The man's understanding combines with the wife's taste to constitute a union.\n\n\"Of National Characteristics, so far as They Depend upon the Distinct Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime\"\n\nHere Kant describes the different ways that various people have finer feelings. He qualifies his remarks by stating, \"[W]hether these national differences are contingent and depend upon the times and the type of government, or are bound by a certain necessity to the climate, I do not here inquire.\"\n\nThe Italians have a strong feeling for the beautiful with some mixture of the thoughtful sublime. The French have mostly a feeling for the beautiful, but with the addition of the joyful sublime. The feeling of the Germans is an almost equal blend of both the beautiful and the splendid sublime in that they are much concerned with outward appearances. The feeling of the noble sublime predominates with the English, whose actions are guided by principles rather than impulses. With their cruel autos-da-fé and harsh conquests, the Spaniards have feeling for the terrifying sublime. Dutch people in Holland have no finer taste and are concerned only with what is useful. Arabs are like the Spaniards. Persians resemble the French. The Japanese are the Englishmen of the Orient. West India displays its love of the grotesque sublime, as also do the Chinese. African Negroes possess no finer feelings. North American Indians, however, have a feeling for the sublime in that they are adventurous, honorable, truthful, proud, brave, and valorous.\n\nIn antiquity, the ancient Greeks and Romans had remarkable feelings for both the beautiful and the sublime. However, with the Caesars, this decayed into a love of false glitter. The subsequent barbarian Gothic civilization had an overpowering feeling for the grotesque. Kant claimed that his time witnessed \"the sound taste of the beautiful and noble blossoming forth both in the arts and sciences and in respect to morals.\" He declared that it is necessary to educate the younger generation so that they will have noble simplicity, high morals, and finer feelings.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1981 by students from Bretton Hall College in Wakefield. The company was based in Wakefield and Castleford before moving to York in 2001.\n\nThe company is now based at York Theatre Royal. It tours work in the UK and internationally.\nThe previous Artistic Director, Marcus Romer, who has written, directed, and shaped the identity of the company since 1995 recently moved on to establish Arts Beacon. As of July 2016, the company artistic direction will be led by Esther Richardson.\n\nIn 1998 Pilot Theatre embarked on their first mid-scale UK tour with their production of \"Lord of the Flies\", which went on to win the company numerous awards and great critical acclaim. Since then the company has developed links with theatres around the country, in particular York Theatre Royal where they are now residents. They were part of the EU Culture 2000 funded programme called Magic-Net along with twelve other countries across Europe and in 2009 they became the UK partner for the European project, Platform 11+, which engaged 13 theatres in 12 European countries to create new pieces of theatre for 11 to 15 year olds. This has opened the door for international touring and collaborations. In 2011 the company toured to Milan, Dresden and Argentina and in 2012 hosted companies from around the EU at a week long event in York as well as visiting the Czech Republic.\n\nThey produced the International Indian Film Academy Awards opening sequence for stage and TV in 2007 at Sheffield Arena. This was in partnership with their new collaborators Kit Monkman and Tom Wexler from KMA who are also based in York.\n\nPilot Theatre have also become strong advocates for using digital technologies within the arts. This has grown through their annual hosting of the Shift Happens conference, which explored new digital technologies and possible uses for them within the arts sector. In 2011 Pilot Theatre hosted the first ever TEDx York event in conjunction with Science City York. Working with online video experts Kinura, Pilot Theatre delivered the multi channel livestream of the world-famous York Mystery Plays in August 2012 as part of their involvement in the BBC and Arts Council England funded project The Space.\n\nTheir dedication and commitment to exploring new ways of engaging young people in the arts and new ways to use technology in the arts has allowed the company the ability to adapt to the changing world and constantly offer a product that is relevant and exciting for their audiences.\n\nPilot Theatre and York Theatre Royal presented Alan Sillitoe's, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner adapted for the stage by Roy Williams which premiered in York before a national tour in Autumn 2012. In 2014, we worked with Roy Williams again on an adaptation of Antigone in co-production with Derby Theatre and Stratford East.\n\nIn the same year we began a large scale cooperation project funded by the European Commission under their European Culture Funding Stream Creative Europe. This project, entitled PLATFORM shift+, consists of 11 partners from 9 countries - ten theatres and a university - all working towards meeting the new challenges of producing theatre for young people in the digital age. As one of the UK's most renowned companies in delivering performance work for young people and exploring innovative approaches to making and sharing work, Pilot Theatre is the leading organisation.\n\nContinuing Pilot's history of International work, in 2014 they began work on the Boomerang - Documents of Poverty and Hope project. This is one of 12 successful projects being run by the European Commission under their Cooperation project with Third Countries - European Culture Funding Stream. Pilot Theatre are working with five other theatres; the Australian Theatre for Young People, Sydney; Dynamo Theatre, Montreal; Presentation House Theatre, Vancouver; Elsinor Theatre, Milan; and O Bando Theatre, Portugal, on the issue of migration and its impact on young people across continents.\n\nThe company has won three Manchester Evening News awards for \"Lord of the Flies\", by William Golding, adapted by Nigel Williams, and \"Beautiful Thing\", by Jonathan Harvey.

It needs a speaker and a listener, a performer and an audience. It is a bodily creation that thrives in live connection.\nThe voice is the mechanism by which a \"poet's voice\" comes alive. Reciting a poem aloud the reciter comes to understand and then to be the 'voice' of the poem. As poetry is a vocal art, the speaker brings their own experience to it, changing it according to their own sensibilities, intonation, the matter of sound making sense; controlled through pitch and stress, poems are full of invisible italicized contrasts. Reading poetry aloud also makes clear the \"pause\" as an element of poetry.\n\n\"The hearing knowledge we bring to a line if poetry is a knowledge of patterns of speech we have known since we were infants.\" Every speaker intuitively course through manipulations of sounds, almost as if we sing to each other all day. Even after three millennia of writing, poetry retains its appeal to the ear, the silent reading eye thereof, thereafter, hears what it is seeing. Sound that was imagined through the eye gradually gave body to poems in performance.\n\nA public reading is typically given on a small stage in a café or bookstore, although reading by prominent poets frequently are booked into larger venues such as amphitheaters and college auditoriums, 'to take poetry public'.\n\nPoetry readings almost always involve poets reading their own work or reciting it from memory but readings often involve several readers (often called \"featured poets\" or \"featureds\"), although normally one poet is chosen as a \"headliner\".\n\nAmerican poet Donald Hall described the increase in emphasis on public readings of poetry in the United States in a 2012 \"New Yorker\" magazine blog post where he recounted it a phenomenon that grew in the last half of the twentieth century.\n\nHall, who speculates that the change may have been due to the star power of Dylan Thomas, wrote, \"It used to be that one poet in each generation performed poems in public. In the twenties, it was Vachel Lindsay, who sometimes dropped to his knees in the middle of a poem. Then Robert Frost took over, and made his living largely on the road.\" Hall suggests that poetry readings have shifted the focus of poetry more towards sound, adding that \"In concentrating on sound, as in anything else, there are things to beware of. Revising a poem one morning, I found myself knowing that a new phrase was repellent, but realized it would pass if I intoned it out loud. Watch out. A poem must work from the platform but it must also work on the page.\"\n\nA poetry slam is a competitive format that has become increasingly popular, especially in the United States, since its inception in the 1980s. A \"slam\" is the art of poetry presented in public as is the \"open mic\" event variant.\n\n"}

The character was written out in 2006, making her final appearance on 23 November 2006. Lytton has since expressed a disappointment in her exit, but stated she will always be grateful for the role. It was announced in July 2018 that Lytton would reprise her role during that year, with Ruby returning on 18 September 2018. Producers soon placed her at the centre of a sexual consent storyline.\n\nRuby arrives in Walford, having run away from boarding school to look for her father, Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). On her arrival, she is befriended by Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), who grills Ruby about her family. After storming out of the café where they are talking, she is mugged by a vagrant in Bridge Street, who grabs hold of Ruby's coat and steals her mobile phone. She is then almost run over by Tina Stewart's (Charlotte Avery) taxi. Ruby feels that Johnny is pushing her away and reminds him that he only saved her by accident when their house caught fire. He was actually trying to save her sister, Scarlet. Scarlet and their mother, Stephanie, died in the fire in March 2004. Ruby is livid when Johnny introduces her to his mistress Tina, who turns out to be the woman who had almost run her over, but later accepts the relationship. Ruby overhears Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) telling people that Johnny is a violent, murdering bully. Ruby confronts him and he denies it. She knows he is lying and stays with Stacey initially and then Peggy at Pat Evans' (Pam St. Clement) house.\n\nRuby catches Johnny having an affair with Amy (Nina Fry) while he is engaged to Tina. She tells Tina and Tina leaves. Ruby eventually forgives her father and moves back in with him but later moves in with boyfriend, Juley Smith (Joseph Kpobie), to whom she lost her virginity. Johnny doesn't take kindly to this, as he has already warned Juley about Ruby. Ruby defends Juley and even turns against her dad for him, but she is devastated to learn that Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) has been paying Juley to sleep with her as part of his feud with Johnny. Ruby feels thankful when Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) helps with her things as she moves in with Juley, Ruby drops her things outside her house whilst walking to her flat. She is upset when Johnny is brutally beaten up on New Year's Eve during a clash with Dennis. On New Year's Day 2006, Ruby thinks that Phil attacked him, unless it wasn't him. When Dennis dies on New Year's Eve, Ruby is unaware that Johnny had him killed. She reacts by getting drunk and collapsing on the floor. Phil, who has broken into Johnny's house to have it out with him, takes her to hospital. Juley attempts to get Ruby back, and she eventually agrees to try again. However, she realises that she cannot trust him when she found herself questioning his phone calls.\n\nRuby discovers that Johnny was an alcoholic in \"Get Johnny Week\" and she leaves him to Phil. She and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) have a heart to heart, and Grant discovers that Phil paid Juley to sleep with Ruby. Grant is furious and burst into Johnny's office where Phil is holding Johnny until he confesses to Dennis's murder. This gives Johnny a chance to get away. There is a big chase, which results in Danny Moon (Jake Maskall) handcuffing the brothers and marching them into the forest. He is about to kill Grant when Jake Moon (Joel Beckett) shoots him instead and kills him. Ruby persuades Johnny to hand himself in, and then returns with Jake to Walford. She is furious with him when he reveals he had killed Danny. Jake becomes obsessed with Ruby's welfare, but takes over the running of her club until she turns 18, in October. Ruby withdraws £2000 for a holiday but decides to return it and is mugged by Juley. Ruby then has a relationship with Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky), Stacey's brother, unaware that he is a womanizer who is only dating her for her fortune. Ruby finds out that her father had a heart attack after an argument with Sean in prison. On the day of Johnny's funeral, Ruby goes missing and Sean finds her, slumped behind the desk in the Scarlet office, with a bottle of vodka. Later, she speaks to Pat who made her think, by saying that her father was normally right about people, including Jake and Sean. Sean later proposes to her, stating he has genuine feelings for her, and she accepts. Later, Ruby learns from Stacey that Sean had kissed and slept with several other women while with her, and confronts him. She makes Sean vow to be true to her, but when she tells his mother, Jean Slater (Gillian Wright), that he is back in Walford, he angrily breaks up with her, throwing her father's ashes in her face. Ruby later leaves Walford in the back of a taxi, having fallen out with Stacey once again.\n\nRuby returns to Walford and reunites with Stacey. Ruby attends the school reunion of Stacey's husband, Martin Fowler (James Bye), where Ruby flirts with Martin's friend Ross Swinden (Ossian Luke). The next day, Ruby tells Stacey that she went back to Ross' house afterwards and had sex with him, but woke up with Martin's other friend, Matt Clarkson (Mitchell Hunt), on top of her. Stacey tells Ruby that she was raped by Matt and eventually Ruby reports this to the police. Ruby moves into a flat on Albert Square. A photograph emerges of Ruby kissing Matt in the club the night before and Ruby is devastated when the police receive it.\n\nRuby and her casting were announced on 3 February 2005. Louisa Lytton was cast in the role. Speaking of her casting, Lytton commented \"I'm nervous and excited all at the same time to be joining \"EastEnders\". This is an amazing opportunity and I can't believe that I'm going to be working alongside some of my favourite actors and actresses.\" On 8 July 2006, Daniel Saney of Digital Spy reported Lytton would be written out of \"EastEnders\" following a mutual decision between the producers and the actress herself. It was decided that the character had no further purpose after the departure of her on-screen father, Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). A spokesperson said \"The way the storylines pan out means there's not really much scope for Louisa's character any more.\" Lytton revealed that she had enjoyed her time at \"EastEnders\", and called it a great experience. She added that she was looking forward to trying new things. Executive producer Kate Harwood stated that Lytton was popular with fans and her character would get a \"dramatic\" exit.\n\nIn December 2009, Lytton said she would have liked her \"EastEnders\" exit to have been more dramatic. Speaking to an \"FHM\" writer, Lytton explained that her exit, which saw Ruby leave in a black cab with her father's ashes, would have been better if it was something \"massive\" and \"dramatic\". In August 2011, Lytton said that she would love to return to the show. She stated that she would immediately cause trouble and come back as a \"hard-faced bitch\", as Ruby often let people walk over her and constantly cried. Lytton also said that she will always be grateful for the part of Ruby. Speaking to a writer from \"OK Magazine\", Lytton admitted that the experience was brilliant and helped give an insight of what she wanted to do in her career. She added \"But there is so much I still want to do at home, like theatre, and build myself up, because I have missed out on things like drama schools. It's funny because when I was there they thought I was a huge star back in Britain!.\"\n\nLytton's return to the series was announced on 18 July 2018, twelve years after her departure. Lytton returns to filming in Summer 2018 and Ruby will return later in the year. While most of Ruby's return details were embargoed, it was confirmed that Ruby would reconcile with Stacey upon her return. John Yorke, the show's executive consultant, approached Lytton with a return, which surprised her, although she quickly accepted the offer. Lytton expressed her excitement to reprise the role and explore the character. She commented, \"We last saw her twelve years ago as a young girl and now she is returning as a woman with scope for major change and some brilliantly challenging storylines.\" Yorke expressed his delight at Ruby's return and described the character as \"much more mature and confident\".\n\nFurther details about Ruby's reintroduction were released on 11 September. It was revealed that Ruby would anonymously contact Stacey and arrange to meet her at the E20 nightclub, leaving Stacey stunned when she realises that she is meeting Ruby. Lytton thought that while it appears that she is visiting a friend as she passes Walford, Ruby is actually \"quite lonely\". She commented, \"I think it's a thing of going back to what she knows and recreating that friendship with her old friend.\" Stacey wants to reestablish a friendship with Ruby and prepares for their night out. Lytton hoped that her and Turner's bond came across well on screen and confirmed that they would recommence the friendship started in her first stint. She added that it was \"surreal\" to reprise the role and described the character as \"older and more confident\" following her reintroduction. Ruby returns in episode 5779, first broadcast on 18 September.\n\nYorke confirmed that when Ruby returns, she would be involved in one of the show's \"biggest storylines\". Two months later, it was announced that Ruby would be raped as part of a sexual consent storyline. The plot begins when Ruby and Stacey attend a party together following her return. The following day, Ruby confides in Stacey that she has been raped, although the perpetrator has an alternative view of the night. Duncan Lindsay of the \"Metro\" confirmed that the perpetrator would not be a regular character. It was reported that the attack would not be shown, but the show's research team worked with charity Rape Crisis England and Wales to accurately portray the storyline. Yorke said that the story would \"challenge the stereotyping and myths that can surround sexual violence and consent\". He described the plot as challenging and emotional and added, \"we hope that by \"EastEnders\" tackling this issue we can raise awareness about an incredibly important issue.\" Lytton was aware of the responsibility attached to the storyline and felt proud to portray the issue. She hoped to \"end the many misconceptions surrounding sexual violence.\" Yvonne Traynor, the CEO of Rape Crisis South London, commented, \"\"EastEnders\" have taken this responsibility very seriously and ensured that their portrayal of sexual violence has been thoroughly researched and is based on realism which is, sadly, so prevalent in our country today.\"\n\nFor her portrayal of Ruby, Lytton was nominated for Best Soap Actor (Female) at the 2018 \"Digital Spy\" Reader Awards. Her sexual consent storyline was also nominated under the \"Best Soap Storyline\" category.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10396741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10396741", "title": "Schenectady Light Opera Company", "text": "Schenectady Light Opera Company\n\nSchenectady Light Opera Company (SLOC) is a nonprofit community theater organization in Schenectady, New York, established in 1926. The current location of the theater is at the new performance art center at 427 Franklin Street, in downtown Schenectady. The company has presented over 200 shows at various locations for over 90 years. The company presents amateur theater productions.\n\nThe Schenectady Light Opera Company (SLOC) was born in 1926 when a group of Van Corlaer and Draper alumni joined together to \"present short plays containing songs and comedy acts.\" The group, directed by Mrs. Etta Moore, a music teacher in the Schenectady City School District, was known as the Bellevue Young People’s Chorus. The group first presented concerts and short operettas before moving on to the Gilbert and Sullivan shows, Trial by Jury and Patience, in 1933-1934. In 1936 the Bellevue Young People’s Chorus changed its name to Schenectady Light Opera Company.\n\nIn the spring of 1942 the Company disbanded for the duration of the war, due to the shortage of male members. In 1946 the group got together again and presented H.M.S. Pinafore at Mont Pleasant High School, the Company’s adopted home. The manpower situation still posed a problem. A note in the group’s newsletter stated, \"To maintain the balance of the parts, no new sopranos will be admitted unless they bring a male.\"\n\nAnother problem was storage. The Company had accumulated vast quantities of costumes and sets, so a search was begun for a building SLOC could call \"home.\" The old Craig School on Balltown Road seemed ideal; however, the zoning laws, made it necessary to petition the State Supreme Court in order to allow a membership corporation to own property. That was successful, and henceforth, Craig School was to be known as the Opera House.\n\nUntil 1950, productions were given at Mont Pleasant High School, with the exception of \"road\" shows to Cobleskill, Schoharie and East Greenbush. In November 1950, SLOC presented The Mikado, in the Erie Theater. \"Move-in\" became a SLOC tradition at the Erie. Friday night the sets were loaded at the Opera House and moved into the Erie after the late movie. Showboat was the last SLOC show at the Erie before it closed in 1956.\n\nBurnt Hills High School hosted The Merry Widow in 1957, and Finian's Rainbow became the first SLOC show in the new Niskayuna High School. In 1959, SLOC first ventured into modern opera with presentations of The Telephone, Down in the Valley and RSVP. SLOC later produced The Medium and Amelia Goes to the Ball.\n\nAlthough the theater continued to produce Gilbert and Sullivan in the 1950s, the productions of Brigadoon, Carousel, Showboat and Oklahoma! marked the transition from operetta to truly American musical theater.\n\nThe 1960s produced SLOC’s first attempts at modern musical comedy- The Music Man, Where's Charley?, Guys and Dolls, and Bye Bye Birdie -as well as the classics, The King and I, My Fair Lady, Kiss Me Kate, and South Pacific. The decade closed with the beautiful She Loves Me, and the exciting West Side Story. The 1970s opened with the comedy A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and the operas Amahl and the Night Visitors and Help, Help, the Globolinks! The 1970s also brought productions of the popular Mame, Hello Dolly!, Annie Get Your Gun; Fiddler on the Roof and Gypsy.\n\nIn 1971 SLOC sold the “Opera House” on Balltown Road and purchased the Beth Israel Synagogue at 826 State Street, Schenectady. Thus began the huge task of turning the building into a theater. In 1972 the new Opera House officially opened with Jacques Brel. This was the beginning of the cabaret shows with table seating and wine, bread and cheese. The SLOC season now included two shows at the Opera House, two shows at Niskayuna High School, as well as concerts, revues and workshops.\n\nIn 1973 SLOC moved its set building operation to the Turn Verein gym located directly behind the Opera House. That closeness to our Opera House greatly aided all aspects of the technical needs for each production.\n\nIn 1974 SLOC made an early contribution to the nation’s Bicentennial with a production of 1776. The Company’s George M! was also an exciting tribute to our country, but also, in the SLOC tradition, a most appropriate way to help celebrate its 50th anniversary. In 1976-1977 we were still performing four shows- two at Niskayuna High School and two at the Opera House. During 1977-1978 SLOC purchased a nearby State Street building to use as its costume house.\n\nIn April 1980 SLOC moved from, Niskayuna High School to Proctor’s Theater, with Shenandoah, and continued its four-show season (two at the Opera house and two at Proctor’s) until 1990 when SLOC did The Most Happy Fella at Proctor’s Theater. In 1987 SLOC purchased a small building on Taurus Road in Niskayuna to use as its set-building facility. We no longer had to keep moving all our sets to rental venues.\n\nIn the fall of 1990 SLOC performed one more show at Niskayuna High School and then began performing only at the Opera House until presenting its 70th anniversary celebration in 1996 with a birthday bash at Proctor’s.\n\nIn April 2010, SLOC purchased a several buildings from the Albany Catholic Diocese that were St John the Baptist, between Franklin and Liberty Streets in Schenectady. This was a major undertaking in order to have sufficient space for performing, rehearsal, storage of costumes and equipment, on-site office and meeting needs, live-in property manager, rentals, plus parking and future additions for set construction and storage. It also is much nicer for audiences, production teams and other volunteers, since it is handicapped accessible, has convenient parking, restaurants within walking distance and is in Schenectady’s developing arts district.\n\nAfter SLOC purchased its new home, the Northeast Ballet Company also needed a new home and moved in as a lease tenant in October 2010. This fit the vision SLOC’s Board and members had of creating a small performing arts complex for local groups. NEB has expanded their lease space as they have grown in the SLOC performing arts complex.\n\nThe opening production in February 2011 in the new theater complex was The Drowsy Chaperone, which played to packed houses. Many reviewers have written that the quality of SLOC’s productions achieved a higher level since being in the new theater.\n\nSince opening at its new theater, SLOC has presented highly acclaimed and award-winning productions including: The Drowsy Chaperone, Les Misérables (Youth Production), Hairspray, Fiddler on the Roof, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Guys and Dolls, Caroline, or Change, The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee (Directed by a high school student), and Young Frankenstein. SLOC has expanded its resources to offer youth the opportunity to develop their performing, technical and artistic skills with productions and workshops.\n\nSLOC’s future plans are to improve the facilities with a new lobby and a set construction and storage facility. The SLOC Board of Directors has developed a new strategic plan, which provides guidance for operational improvements to strive for success internally as well as for its customers.\n\nSLOC holds an annual High School Awards program in which a committee of SLOC board members observe high school shows, then later in the year awards excellent performers and the top three high school musicals in the Capital District.\n\nBoard Members:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "86774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86774", "title": "September Morn", "text": "September Morn\n\nMatinée de Septembre (English: September Morn) is a controversial oil painting on canvas completed in 1911 by the French artist Paul Émile Chabas. Painted over several summers, it depicts a nude girl or young woman standing in the shallow water of a lake, prominently lit by the morning sun. She is leaning slightly forward in an ambiguous posture, which has been read variously as a straightforward portrayal of protecting her modesty, huddling against the cold, or sponge bathing. It has also been considered a disingenuous pose permitting the \"fetishisation of innocence\".\n\n\"September Morn\" was first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1912, and although the identity of its first owner is unclear, it is certain that Leon Mantashev acquired the painting by the end of 1913. It was taken to Russia, and in the aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917 was feared lost. It resurfaced in 1935 in the collection of Calouste Gulbenkian, and after his death in 1955 was sold to a Philadelphia broker, who donated it anonymously to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met) in 1957. it is not on display.\n\nFrom 1913 on, reproductions of the painting caused controversy in the United States. An art dealer in Chicago was charged with indecency and another in New York was targeted by anti-vice crusader Anthony Comstock, both after displaying \"September Morn\". Over the next few years the work was reproduced in a variety of forms, including on pins and calendars, while censorship and art were debated in newspapers. Chabas' painting inspired songs, stage shows and films; eventually some 7 million reproductions were sold, though Chabas – who had not copyrighted \"September Morn\" – did not receive any royalties.\n\nAlthough several women claimed to be the model for \"September Morn\", Chabas never revealed her identity. He described the work as \"all I know of painting\", and responded positively to statements that it was his masterpiece. Later writers, however, have described the painting as kitsch, valuable only as a historic artifact.\n\n\"September Morn\" depicts, from an oblique point of view, a naked blonde girl or young woman standing ankle-deep in the water near the shoreline of a tranquil lake surrounded by hills. The figure is backlit by the morning sun, but fully visible, if a little darker than her surroundings. Her arms are folded about her body, her right arm passing below her breasts as she grasps her left elbow, while her left arm conceals her pubic area. This pose has been variously interpreted as the subject protecting herself from the cold, covering her modesty, or sponge bathing, or as the artist's \"fetishisation of innocence\".\n\nReviews in 1912 noted that the painting was dominated by grays: those of her shaded body, the blue-grays of the September water, the green-grays of the sky, and the pink-grays of the hills behind her. The art critic François Thiébault-Sisson described this as evoking the morning, the young subject preparing to bathe while \"light grey vapours are still floating over the lake\". This oil painting on canvas measures , and Chabas's signature is located in the lower left.\n\nBy the time he painted \"September Morn\", Paul Émile Chabas (1869–1937) already had an established reputation as an academic artist. He regularly submitted to the Paris Salon, first participating in 1886. He won a third class medal in the Salon of 1895, and four years later won the Prix National for his painting \"Joyeux ébats\", which earned him a gold medal at the 1900 Exposition Universelle and was acquired by the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes. In subsequent years Chabas spent the winters working in Paris, while he passed his summers painting young women along the shores of rivers, lakes, and seas. In 1902 he was made a Chevalier in the Legion of Honour.\n\nChabas studied under artists such as Tony Robert-Fleury, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Albert Maignan. Although his earlier works were generally portraits, most of the painter's later production consisted of nude girls and young women. The lakes and rivers of France were common settings for his paintings, which gave prominence to the interaction of light with the models and their surroundings. \"September Morn\" is typical of his style.\n\nJ. Valmy-Baysse, in a 1910 overview of the artist, attributes Chabas's style to the painter's time at the family summer home along the Erdre; he identifies the \"grace of adolescence, its undefinable charm, [and] its chaste nudity\" of the models with Chabas's reminiscences of his youth. The art historian Bram Dijkstra has argued otherwise, stating that \"no artist was more assiduous in exploiting the prurient possibilities of the woman-child\" than Chabas, whom he considers to have \"emphasized analogies of nude little girls and the familiar poses of vanity or physical arousal given to adult women\".\n\nFemale nudes were the dominant subject of painting in French Salons at the end of the 19th century. Female models had become more common than male ones beginning in the early 19th century, first serving allegorical roles or as muses, but eventually becoming individuals \"who could be classified and whose history could be written\". In academic art – such as that of Chabas – the models were not portrayed as they were, but as idealized nudes, based on classical ideals; the body hair of women models, for instance, would not be shown, and the pubic area was rendered smoothly. The hostess Suzanne Delve, who later claimed to have stood for \"September Morn\", said that models were willing to provide \"service to art\" by posing nude for such works.\n\nNot all forms of nude imagery were acceptable in France. The end of the 19th century had seen the introduction of various laws against pornography, images of adults and children meant to \"provoke, incite, or stimulate debauchery\". Works targeted were initially those meant for wide distribution (and thus, the lower class). However, the Australian art historian Fae Brauer writes that the line between art and pornography was blurred by the early 1910s; even tighter laws, introduced in 1908, had resulted in censorship of modernist works. For instance, three paintings by Kees van Dongen (including two of his daughter) were rejected from the Salon d'Automne between 1911 and 1913 on grounds of indecency.\n\nThe United States had, since colonial times, generally been more puritan in terms of art than Europe. In the mid- and late-19th century the country's government implemented laws against obscenity, such as the Tariff of 1842 which banned the importing of foreign works of art deemed obscene. By the end of the 19th century, an uneasy understanding had been reached: museums could hold works depicting nudity, but commercial works (including photographs of artwork) could be – and were – confiscated. Tensions remained over the issue of whether nudes represented European-style sophistication (a trait important to the upper-class) or encouraged behaviors which threatened families and encouraged \"impure imaginations\".\n\nChabas began work on \"September Morn\" in mid-1910 at Talloires on the shores of Lake Annecy in Haute-Savoie, some south-east of Paris. The model, whom he never identified but referred to as \"Marthe\", was well known to his family. Owing to the financial situation of the sixteen-year-old's family, \"Marthe\" had to work to support her mother. On the first day of painting, \"Marthe\" entered the morning water and instinctively recoiled at its chilliness. Chabas approved of this pose, saying that it was \"perfect\". Over the course of two summers he worked on the painting, half an hour every morning. The work was completed on a September morning in 1911, giving the painting its name. In 1935, responding to claims that \"Marthe\" was living in poverty, Chabas explained that she had continued posing for him until she was 28, when she married a rich industrialist, and that she was now aged 41, plump, and had three children.\n\nNumerous women have claimed or been claimed to be the model, some presenting different versions of events. In 1913, a Miss Louise Buckley, performing in Eugene, Oregon, said that she had been paid $1,000 and posed in the artist's studio. The Paris-based artist Jules Pages, meanwhile, stated that the woman depicted in \"September Morn\" had been a 25-year-old of good character who earned her living as an artist's model, but had gone into hiding after the controversy over the painting. Other claimants included a Swedish model named Gloria and a variety actress named Irene Shannon; the latter made the claim in the lead-up to a vaudeville skit called \"November Mourning\".\nIn 1937, twenty-four years after \"September Morn\" caused controversy in the United States, the Parisian hostess Suzanne Delve declared that she had been the model. In her account, Chabas – who had known her since she was an infant – had her pose nude in his studio and later painted Lake Annecy in her absence. Delve described her nervousness at the first session, her mother chatting to her to distract her mind while Chabas's wife played soothing music on the piano. She said she took her pose \"instinctively\" and that the controversy over the painting had ruined her life, as no Frenchman would want to marry a woman marred by scandal.\n\nYet another version is presented by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met) in their 1966 catalogue of French holdings, including \"September Morn\". According to this telling, Chabas completed the painting over three summers at Lake Annecy, though his peasant model served only as the basis for the figure's body. The head was based on a sketch of a young American, Julie Phillips, which Chabas had completed upon observing her and her mother dining in Paris; finding her profile to his liking, he silently drew her, then introduced himself and \"apologized for his presumption\".\n\nChabas first exhibited \"September Morn\" in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. Because he did not plan to sell it, he gave a price of 50,000 francs ($10,000) – more than he expected anybody to pay. For the painting, and his \"Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight\", Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At the Salon, the painting was uncontroversial, and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as \"Town & Country\" and \"The International Studio\".\n\nSources are unclear as to the painting's provenance after the Salon. According to the Met, the New York-based Philip (or Philippe) Ortiz, manager of the New York Branch of Braun and Company, purchased it in late 1912. According to a 1933 report in the \"Middletown Times Herald\", he paid 12,000 francs ($2,400) for the work, but never brought the painting back to the United States. However, Brauer suggests that Ortiz sent it to his gallery in New York, where it caused a controversy. According to \"Time\", the painting was acquired by Leon Mantashev  1913, after the painting was returned to Chabas.\n\nA 1935 article in the \"Montreal Gazette\", meanwhile, stated that the original \"September Morn\" had yet to go to the United States, and that Chabas had sold it directly to Mantashev. According to Chabas, this was after an American approached him to purchase the painting, but was unwilling to pay the asking price. In her memoirs, \"Vogue\" editor Edna Woolman Chase recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York, and that – although he had been interested in acquiring the original – he had been unable to do so. Although it is possible that the original did not cross the Atlantic by 1913, it is clear that reproductions did.\n\nA full-size reproduction of \"September Morn\" was displayed in a window of Jackson and Semmelmeyer, a photography shop in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1913. A passing police officer noticed the print and on grounds that it was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison, Jr., agreed with the policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it. Fred Jackson, the owner, was charged with indecency, and at his request the case was brought to trial on March 18.\n\nIn front of a jury, the city's art censor Jeremiah O'Connor testified that \"September Morn\" was lewd and should not be displayed in public, but rather only in a museum exhibition. W. W. Hallam of the Chicago Vice Committee agreed, arguing that, as the woman was committing the illegal act of bathing in public, \"September Morn\" had to be banned. Other witnesses for the prosecution included censors, educators, and clergy, such as the superintendent Ella Flagg Young and the head of the Juvenile Protective Association Gertrude Howe Britton.\n\nJackson, acting as his own lawyer, highlighted the hypocrisy of censoring the painting while a nude statue of Diana stood in front of the Montgomery Ward Building. He called upon painters, poets, and sculptors as his witnesses, including the artist Oliver Grover and the art critic Walter Smith. In his testimony, Grover stated \"A nude woman is no more\nindecent than a bare tree. Men and women weren't born with overcoats on. Anyhow, indecency may be decidedly apart from nudity.\"\n\nAfter less than an hour of deliberations, the jury found for Jackson, allowing him to reinstate the image in his display; Jackson was so pleased that he promised a free copy of \"September Morn\" to each juror. Ten days after the trial Mayor Harrison went to the city council and proposed stricter obscenity laws. The city government agreed, and imposed a $25–100 fine for displaying nude art along public roads and in places frequented by children. By September Jackson (together with fellow art dealers Samuel Meyer and William Kuhl) had been found in violation of this law. Mayor Harrison later stated that he was \"through\" with the painting, saying \"Chicago has been made the laughing stock of the whole country because of this bathing girl picture\".\n\nFurther controversy arose in New York in May 1913, two months after the conclusion of the Chicago trial. Anthony Comstock, head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice and nationally recognized for his campaigns against \"smut\", saw \"September Morn\" – sources differ as to whether it was the original or a print  – on display in the window of Braun and Company, an art dealership on West 46th Street. Rushing inside, he raged \"There's too little morn and too much maid! Take it out!\". A clerk, James Kelly, removed the work, but Ortiz, the gallery's manager, reinstated it in the window after returning from his lunch break.\n\nComstock threatened Ortiz with legal action, and the manager – unaware that Comstock could not arrest him, and fearful that he could cause trouble for the gallery – was initially frightened. He consulted with Arthur Brisbane of the \"New York Evening Journal\", who told him he had nothing to fear, and sent some reporters to cover the story. The following day, the controversy was highly covered in the press, who hailed Ortiz as \"one art expert with the courage to stand up against Comstock and his dictatorship\". Following Comstock's visit large crowds blocked the street outside Braun and Company, ogling \"September Morn\". The gallery owner refused to sell his large print of \"September Morn\", so that it could remain in his window.\n\nAfter two weeks, when the dealership had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In a letter to the editor of \"The New York Times\", he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to \"September Morn\" status as a work of art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in \"American Heritage\", attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.\n\nThe controversy promoted polemics regarding \"September Morn\" and censorship, and multiple editorial cartoons; one depicted a young woman bathing, only her head showing, with a caption attributed to Comstock reading \"Don't you suppose I can imagine what is UNDER the water?\". Comstock called the work \"demoralizing in the extreme and especially calculated to excite immodesty in the young\", arguing that it must be suppressed in the interest of the children. He emphasized that \"the law is the law ... the picture will have to come out of the window\". Reverend Sydney Ussher of St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church took a more moderate approach, explaining that \"so vivid a display of nudity as \"September Morn\"\" would best not be displayed in the United States, owing to the people's relative lack of appreciation for art.\nOther, more positive, views were also expressed. The suffragist Inez Milholland defended \"September Morn\", stating that it was \"exquisite and delicate, depicting perfect youth and innocence\", and found it \"funny, if it weren't so sad\" that such a work would be censored while more titillating film posters were left untouched. The social activist Rose Pastor Stokes wrote that this \"glorious work of art\" was a \"rare\" depiction of \"the loveliest dream that nature ever made real—the human Body Beautiful\" and that shame over one's body should not be blamed on \"September Morn\", but on a failed education system. The artist James Montgomery Flagg proclaimed \"only a diseased mind can find anything immoral in \"September Morn\"\".\n\nIn his 1931 autobiography, the public relations pioneer Harry Reichenbach claimed responsibility for the controversy surrounding \"September Morn\" – and the work's resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could unload the stock. They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. When there was no response, he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display. The public relations man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price – from 10 cents to a dollar.\n\nA 1937 \"Salt Lake Tribune\" article stated that, after the 1913 controversies, reproductions of \"September Morn\" were shown \"on the front page of every newspaper in the land\". Ortiz required these newspapers to pay a charge and mention his copyright, otherwise face a penalty of $500 to $1000; Chase recalled that \"Vogue\" had been one of those charged. These newspaper reproductions, however, were sometimes censored. Fred L. Boalt of \"The Seattle Star\", covering a local exhibit of a reproduction, explained his newspaper's rationale for such censorship: \"For humane as well as other reasons, [...] the \"Star\" artist has painted in a short petticoat. He didn't want to do it. He suffered. But we made him do it.\"\n\nLithograph copies of \"September Morn\" were mass-produced for popular sale, extending the success that followed the scandal, and were widely hung in private homes. Reproductions were featured on a variety of products, including cigar bands, postcards, bottle openers, statuettes, watch fobs, and candy boxes; the model was also popular as a tattoo. \"September Morn\" was the first nude used for calendars, and by the late 1950s it had featured on millions. A couplet referring to Chabas's work, \"Please don't think I'm bad or bold, but where its deep it's awful cold\", was widely circulated.\nAllusions to the painting were common in vaudeville acts, becoming stock gags in the Orpheum Circuit. Stage imitations of the painting were also created. In 1913, for instance, Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. cast Ann Pennington as the model as part of his \"Follies\". In this successful version of \"September Morn\", the subject bore a sheer cape, with leaves placed strategically over her body, and stood on a stage made-up as water. A burlesque act, deeming itself the \"September Morning Glories\", was also created, as was a three-act musical based on the painting. The latter – featuring a fifty-strong chorus line – was put on by Arthur Gillespie and Frank Tannehill, Jr. and debuted at the La Salle Theater in Chicago. In Milwaukee, a man wearing \"little or no clothing\" passed himself off as \"September Morn\" at the 1915 Wisconsin State Fair; he was brought to trial and fined $25. Theatrical references to the painting continued into the 1950s. For instance, in Tennessee Williams's 1957 play \"Orpheus Descending\", the character Val sees it hanging in his room and mentions he \"might keep turning the light on to take another look at it\".\n\n\"September Morn\" also inspired several films. A two-reel production by Pathé, titled \"September Morn\", was released in February 1914 and followed the misadventures of a sailor who gets a tattoo of the model. After his girlfriend disapproves, he tries clothing the naked woman with a ripped skirt, but this fails to gain his lover's approval; ultimately, he ends up with a fully clothed nude and the text \"Votes for Women\" inked on his arm. Meanwhile, \"September Mourning\", a November 1915 release produced by L-KO, portrayed a pair of artists first vying for the attentions of a young woman in the park, then invading a school for girls. Robert McElravy, reviewing for \"Moving Picture World\", found the film funny, but considered it to lack plot. A third film, Lois Weber's \"Hypocrites\", portrayed \"The Naked Truth\" (an uncredited Margaret Edwards) in a manner similar to Chabas's model.\nSeveral songs inspired by \"September Morn\" were likewise released. Musicians Frank Black and Bobby Heath penned a song, \"September Morn\", based on the painting, and Aubrey Stauffer of Chicago published sheet music (for voice and piano) of \"\", from Gillespie and Tannehill's musical. At Tin Pan Alley, Henry I. Marshall composed two works, a waltz for piano titled \"\", and a piece for voice and piano titled \"\", the latter featuring lyrics by Stanley Murphy. Both were published through Jerome H. Remick  Co. in 1913.\n\n\"September Morn\" also inspired an eponymous lime and grenadine cocktail, described in 1917 as having gin, and later in 1930 with rum and egg white. \n\nAs interest grew, purity societies attempted to ban reproductions of \"September Morn\", and people in possession of them ran the risk of confiscation and fines. Postcards bearing the painting were banned from the postal system. Harold Marx, a New Orleans art dealer who displayed a reproduction, was arrested a month after being told to take the painting down; displays of reproductions were also forcibly removed in Miami and Atlanta. In Chicago, a man was charged with disorderly conduct after bringing home a reproduction. Irene Deal, who dressed in a union suit and posed as \"Miss September Morn\" in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, as a publicity stunt, was controversially fined $50 for disorderly conduct. In 1914, students at the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio, burned a copy of the painting for being against their religious beliefs.\n\nUltimately some 7 million reproductions of \"September Morn\", prints of which remained popular as late as the 1960s, were sold. Reichenbach characterized this popularity as a \"laugh on the overzealous guardians of virtue\" in which the entire American populace participated. Inspired by the commercial success of \"September Morn\", displays of images of nude women became more common; a \"New York Times\" reader wrote in 1915 that they had become \"increasingly vulgar and suggestive\".\n\nIn 1937 \"Life\" deemed \"September Morn\" \"one of the most familiar paintings in the world\", and a retrospective \"Toledo Blade\" article characterized the model as having become America's number one pin-up girl. Writing in 1957, Considine declared \"September Morn\" to be \"the most controversial painting in the history of [the United States]\", and the \"New York Post\" declared it \"the most famous nude till the Marilyn Monroe calendar\". Carson wrote in 1961 that \"September Morn\" had caused \"the most heated controversy over nudity, art, and morals\" in the United States since Hiram Powers' statue \"The Greek Slave\" in the 1840s.\n\nThe oil baron Leon Mantashev acquired the original \"September Morn\" in  1913, for a price of $10,000 and brought it with him to Russia. After the outbreak of the October Revolution the painting was feared destroyed. Following Mantashev's escape from Russia, pieces of his sizeable collection that were considered to have artistic value were sent to museums, but there was no information regarding works such as \"September Morn\". By 1933 Chabas was seeking information regarding his work's fate, which \"The Milwaukee Journal\" suggested was \"hanging in some crowded Russian room, its owner perhaps completely ignorant of its world fame\". At the time several American galleries had copies purported to be the original.\n\nThe painting, however, was safe; Mantashev had smuggled it out of the country, reportedly \"rip[ping] it out of its frame\" when the revolution broke out. In the early 1930s, in desperate need of funds, he sold \"September Morn\" to the Armenian art collector and philanthropist Calouste Gulbenkian for $30,000; it was the last painting he owned. A United Press reporter discovered the painting, which was framed as a tondo, in Gulbenkian's Paris home in 1935. There it hung with works by artists such as Claude Monet and Paul Cézanne. By 1937 \"September Morn\" was on display in the Musée du Luxembourg, hung between works by Jean-François Raffaëlli and Eugène Carrière. After Gulbenkian's death in 1955, the painting was acquired by Wildenstein and Company of New York.\n\n\"September Morn\" was purchased by the Philadelphia broker and sportsman William Coxe Wright for $22,000 in 1957. In April of that year he offered it to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, but the painting was rejected for having \"no relation to the stream of 20th century art\". Eventually he anonymously donated the work – valued at an estimated $30,000 – to the Met in New York City. Speaking for the museum, Dudley T. Easby explained that, although the painting could not be classified as a masterpiece, it was nevertheless \"a part of art history in view of the controversy that raged around the picture in earlier years\".\nAfter acquisition, in September 1957 the painting was displayed near the Met's front entrance, taking a place previously occupied by the Pérussis Altarpiece. This position of honor was held for several weeks. Hughes reported a \"veritable pilgrimage\" of visitors came to see the painting, which she considered to add a \"fresh, popular appeal\" to the Met which drew museum-goers who would never have come otherwise. By then, the earlier scandal of the model's nudity had lessened; discussing an exhibit of the painting in Toledo, Ohio, Alan Schoedel of the \"Toledo Blade\" quoted a viewer as saying that 1950s America was so inundated with racy calendar art that the painting \"couldn't stand the competition\".\n\nAfter \"September Morn\" was acquired by the Met, it was displayed at several venues, including the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco in 1958, the Toledo Museum of Art in Toledo, Ohio (also 1958), and by the Municipal Art Commission of Los Angeles in 1959. Six years later it was again exhibited at Palace of the Legion of Honor, as part of an exhibition of works collected by the Wrights. In 1971, the Met removed \"September Morn\" from display and placed it in storage; Walter Monfried of \"The Milwaukee Journal\" wrote that the once-racy painting was now considered \"too tame and banal\". , the Met's website lists the painting as not on display, though it had been hung in the museum around 2011.\n\nIn 1913, Chabas stated that he was \"pained and humiliated\" by the controversy over \"September Morn\", though he later expressed more positive views. He described the work as \"all I know of painting\", and responded positively to statements that it was his masterpiece. In a 1914 interview, he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting, as it \"was [his] wife's favorite picture\". At the time of his death in 1937, Chabas had only a single picture in his room: a reproduction of the painting, completed from memory; he had boasted \"If I had never seen it from the day I put down my brushes after painting it, I could make a perfect copy.\" However, not having copyrighted the work, he did not receive any royalties from the marketing frenzy in the United States; he recalled, \"Nobody was thoughtful enough even to send me a box of cigars.\"\n\nReviewing the painting after the Salon, Tr.L. in the praised Chabas's technique as drawing \"of a rare purity\", and modeling \"of a remarkable delicacy\". Henri Frantz, reviewing the Paris Salon for \"The International Studio\", described \"September Morn\" as \"one of the [Salon]'s most remarkable figure subjects\", highlighting the nude's \"graceful form\". In \"Le Temps\", François Thiébault-Sisson found that, despite an \"excessively translucent technique\", the painting had \"indisputable charm\" and included \"superior, very artistic, and delicately composed\" imagery. A 1913 article in the \"Oregon Daily Journal\" described the model as \"beautifully drawn\", and suggested that \"it requires a powerful imagination to find anything suggestive in the work\".\n\nLater reviews were less positive. The director of the Met, James Rorimer, wrote in 1957 that \"September Morn\" stood at \"different ends of a wide spectrum\" than the works of Old Masters and \"modern giants\", but was important in helping viewers \"realize the full benefit of our heritage\" in their explorations of past and present art. That year, the \"Montreal Gazette\" art critic opined that the painting was banal and unacceptable for display in the Met's main hall. The reviewer suggested that \"September Morn\", with its \"delicate, pearly tonality and simple, sparse, airy composition\", would be best served by being displayed among works considered better by early 20th-century collectors but since reviewed poorly, to \"dramatiz[e] for the public the danger of too-hasty judgments\".\n\nIn 1958, Blake-More Godwin of the Toledo Museum of Art stated that, although \"September Morn\" was certainly art, it was not \"great art\" and was overshadowed by the controversy it had created; the painting, he said, \"bears the same relationship to art as a minor poem does to the classic and the imperishable\". Three years later, in an article in \"The Kenyon Review\", Alfred Werner described \"September Morn\" as a \"classic of kitsch\" and \"the 'idealized' nude at its worst\": \"without a wrinkle of the skin, without any breathing of the flesh ... pink, soft, spineless\". This classification of kitsch has been applied by several further writers, including Kendrick and the film scholar Norman Taylor.\n\nSeveral writers have included \"September Morn\" in lists of works depicting children with erotic or pornographic subtexts. Brauer argues that although the nude \"seems to embody the moral purity at puberty\", this innocence is actually a fetishistic mechanism which both allowed the work to pass the censors and be eroticised. She concludes that the painting is \"paedophilically provocative\", and that Chabas was protected from censure by his status as an established artist and father. Such views have not been universally held. For instance, the historian Paul S. Boyer describes \"September Morn\" as \"charmingly innocent\", and the art writer Elizabeth Lunday finds the painting to be \"offensive only on the grounds of blandness\".\n\n"}

Built in 2014 to host sporting and entertainment events, it replaced the former National Stadium on the recommendation of then Community Development and Sports Minister Abdullah Tarmugi in Parliament in 2001. His proposal was based on a Committee on Sporting Singapore report to promote a culture of sports in the city-state.\n\nIt is the first and largest sports facilities infrastructure Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) project in the world and Singapore's flagship PPP project of this nature. Following an Invitation to Tender by the then Singapore Sports Council in 2006, the consortium SportsHub Pte Ltd comprising four equity partners, InfraRed Capital Partners, Dragages Singapore, Cushman & Wakefield Facilities & Engineering, and Global Spectrum Asia, won the bid for the project on January 19, 2008. It was officially appointed on August 25, 2010 to design, build, finance and operate the Singapore Sports Hub for a period of 25 years.\n\nConstruction of the Singapore Sports Hub began with a ground-breaking ceremony on 29 September 2010, before the former arena there was demolished. Served primarily by the Stadium MRT station, it was completed in June 2014 and, among others, rolled out a new 55,000-seat National Stadium with the largest free-spanning retractable dome roof in the world, an aquatic centre, a multi-sport indoor arena, and a water sports facility. The Singapore Sports Hub, which incorporated an existing 12,000-seat Singapore Indoor Stadium, began operations on June 30, 2014 for the general public to start using its facilities. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong officially opened it 13 months later on July 26, 2015.\n\nThe Rugby World Club 10s on 21–22 June 2014 was the first sporting event at the new national stadium. The clash between Singapore and Juventus on 16 August 2014 was the first football game there.\n\nSince opening its doors, the Sports Hub has been a venue for major international, regional and local events. It has played host to the 2015 SEA Games, 2016 Singapore National Day Parade, BNP Paribas WTA Finals, HSBC Singapore Rugby Sevens, International Champions Cup and superstars Madonna, Coldplay and Jay Chou.\n\nThe 35-hectare Singapore Sports Hub includes the following facilities:\n\n\nThe demolition of the former National Stadium was slated to begin in 2008 while the construction of the new Sports Hub was originally planned for completion in 2011. Due to the financial crisis of 2007–2010 and high construction costs, the project was inevitably delayed. In 2008, barring any major problems, the hub should be ready by 2013 when Singapore would play host to the 27th Southeast Asian Games. However, expected delays were announced in 2009 and Singapore had to withdrew its hosting rights for the 2013 Southeast Asian Games. In August 2010, it was reported that the contract to begin construction had been signed with plans for the demolition works of the former National Stadium to start in October 2010 and for the completion of the new Sports Hub in April 2014. The demolition of the National Stadium started with a groundbreaking ceremony on 29 September 2010, marking the official end of the Grand Old Dame.\n\nThree finalist consortia (Singapore Gold Consortium, Alpine Mayreder, Singapore Sports Hub Consortium) submitted their plans in Feb 2007.\n\nOn 19 January 2008, the Singapore government awarded the development of the Sports Hub project to Singapore Sports Hub Consortium (SSHC), led by Dragages Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\nDuring the announcement of the successful bidder at a press conference, the minister of Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said,\n\n\"The Consortium displayed significant strengths in programming, team culture and partnership, functionality and layout. It also offered the best value for money solution for Singapore.\"\n\nConcerts at the Singapore Indoor Stadium\n\nConcerts at the Singapore National Stadium\n\n\n"}

Tamils contributed significantly to Sinhala cinema as well as Indian Tamil cinema, also known as \"Kollywood\". Only a few Tamil language films were produced in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka.

{"id": "708181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=708181", "title": "Subtext", "text": "Subtext\n\nSubtext or undertone is any content of a creative work which is not announced explicitly by the characters or author, but is implicit or becomes something understood by the observer of the work as the production unfolds. Subtext can also refer to the thoughts and motives of the characters which are only covered in an aside. Subtext can also be used to imply controversial subjects without specifically alienating people from the fiction, often through use of metaphor. Especially in light of their inherently ambiguous and self-referential character, many authors have explicitly used subtexts (or subtexts about subtexts) in humor. \n\nSubtext is content underneath the dialogue. Under dialogue, there can be conflict, anger, competition, pride, showing off, or other implicit ideas and emotions. Subtext is the unspoken thoughts and motives of characters — what they really think and believe. \n\nSubtext is also a frequently used method of subtly inserting social or political commentary into fiction. Subtext is often also inserted in narratives where explicit themes are unable to be shown or expressed due to censorship or simply interest in appealing to a general audience. Frequently, these subtexts may include a sexual nature or possible references to sexual orientation. Their inclusion is such so that they are easily overlooked by younger viewers but may be caught by more mature viewers. Subtext also serves to add complexity to a premise that may superficially appeal to younger viewers but may also attract older fans, as is often the case with cartoons, science fiction and fantasy. It also may serve to aid in suspension of disbelief.\n\nSubtext includes information about the period and culture in which the author of a book is writing that may not be deliberately articulated but is conveyed through the text in speech, social customs or historical details. \n\nA more recently coined term, metamessage is considered by some authors to be synonymous with subtext. \"Metamessage\" is a term more commonly used in the analysis of business communication rather than of literary works.\n\nThe author David Baboulene, in his practical academic work on story theory, \"The Story Book\", defines subtext as \"the result of any form of gap in knowledge between any of the participants in a story; for example, between the author and a character, between two characters or between the audience and at least one character.\"\n\nAn example occurs in the 1978 movie Superman. Lois Lane has just met Clark Kent. The subtext is that she has taken an instant dislike to him. At the surface, however, their conversation seems only to solicit and supply information about the existence of others of Clark Kent's type. \"Any more at home like you?\" she inquires. \"Uh, not really, no\", Clark replies. \n\nIn the play \"Ghosts\" by Henrik Ibsen, subtext is important in gaining a greater understanding of the characters, as they cannot always speak freely due to the constrictions of social conventions at the time.\n\nA scene in Woody Allen's movie \"Annie Hall\", in which subtitles explain the characters' inner thoughts during an apparently innocent conversation, is an example of the subtext of a scene being made explicit.\n\nVictorian novels may feature confining social norms such as strict marriage conventions, taboos against births out of wedlock, inheritance to first born sons, etc., that form the subtext of plot and character. These issues can be deployed unconsciously, as in Wilkie Collins' \"The Woman in White\" or as part of a concealed critique of gender politics, as in Charlotte Brontë's \"Jane Eyre\".\n\nIn the episode \"My Best Friend's Bottom\" of the British comedy TV series \"Coupling\", \"Captain Subtext\" is a tool used in the narrative to explicitly make the viewers aware of the subtextual message in the dialogue. In it, the dialogue and the subtext have been deliberately made humorous.\n\nTelevision sci-fi such as the original \"Star Trek\" and \"Doctor Who\" (both of which implicitly avoided onscreen sexual situations) have often been discussed with respect to certain scenes or lines of dialogue.\n\nCues for the subtext are sometimes given in the main text in the form of \"intertexts\", which are allusions to the themes of other texts. An example is \"Blade Runner\", which can be interpreted as containing numerous biblical (intertextual) allusions, framing the subtext as a religiously inspired theme—the search for the Creator and the meaning of life beyond physical existence.\n\nHistorians have often identified an anticipated future revolution, often without the ruling party's understanding.\n\nSuch an example of the power and controversy of subtexts might include the deliverance theme pervasive in the songs, stories, and symbols of the slaves in the United States up through the Civil Rights era and, perhaps, still today. The slave prayers, with their theme of deliverance, may have seemed subversive, as striking at planter ideology and control \n\nSubtext messages have seen fairly widespread use as a way to combat censorship in literary works, for example in the former Communist bloc. The practice is of course much older; e.g. one find works from the middle ages criticizing the church establishment. Some of these works use a formal technique called \"double structure\" in which the same text can have different (usually antithetical) meanings by reading sentences or verses in two different orders.\n\nAccording to a 2008 organizational communication textbook, \"meta message\" is a term coined by lawyer Gerard Nierenberg in his 1995 book \"The Art of Negotiating\" to denote (in the words of the textbook) \"those messages that are conveyed between the lines of what we explicitly say or write, possibly due to the purpose, context, or timing of the message and/or the relationship between the people communicating\".\n\nThe term also appears in a 1972 book of Gregory Bateson, who suggested a somewhat similar distinction, although in the form of a potentially infinite hierarchy of messages, metamessages, meta-metamessages and so on. Bateson argued that any message needs to be interpreted in the frame of reference established by a superordinate message cueing how the textual message is intended. Alan Wolfe points out that Bateson's concepts and terminlogy are rather technical, and are thus commonly misinterpreted. In particular, in Bateson's work the metamessage is the framing message, not the actual (subtext) meaning assigned to the subordinate message in the context of the framing message. About two decades before introducing the metamessage terminology into his works, Bateson studied by what \"mood sign[al]\" (his earlier term for metamessage) subordinated messages are interpreted \"seriously, jokingly, sarcastically, as gestures of friendliness, as acts of aggression\" etc. Invoking Bertrand Russell's Theory of Logical Types, Bateson proposed that for every signal, there is always signal level above it which precisely determines its interpretation. Bateson's theory was however criticized as too rigid and lacking explanatory power for real-world communication phenomena in which signals of any kind (at any level) can be deceitful.\n\nMetamessages can be delivered by a wide variety of means, including verbal modifiers (like \"certainly\", \"only\", \"just\", etc.), and—in spoken communication—by paralanguage, e.g. by rhythm and pitch. Metamessages can also be conveyed by body language.\n\nThe famous pipe image from \"The Treachery of Images\" with the subtitle \"ceci n'est pas une pipe\" (meaning \"this is not a pipe\") is sometimes given as an example of metamessage conveyed by paralanguage.\n"}

Most of his works were adaptations of European plays, and many became successful enough to tour throughout the English-speaking world. He is, however, perhaps best remembered today as the librettist of several comic operas, notably \"Haddon Hall\".\n\nGrundy was born in Manchester, England, the son of Alderman Charles Sydney Grundy. He was educated at Owens College, Manchester, and studied law at the Middle Temple. He was called to the bar in 1869 and practised law until 1876.\n\nHis early one-act farce, \"A Little Change\", was produced at the Haymarket Theatre in 1872 by the Kendals. This was followed by \"All at Sea\" in 1873, also starring the Kendals. In 1876, Grundy published \"The Days of His Vanity\". He wrote \"Mammon\" for W. H. Vernon at the Strand Theatre in 1877 and \"After Long Years\" for the Folly Theatre in 1879. Early comedies included \"The Glass of Fashion\" (1882), \"The Silver Shield\" (1885), and the blank verse \"Clito\" for Wilson Barrett (1886).\nGrundy became well known as an adapter of French and German plays, cleaning them up for British audiences and revisiting the source material to craft his final product. As the protagonist in his 1900 play, \"A Debt of Honour\", explains: \"It all takes place in Paris: nobody pretends that such things happen here.\" Among his earlier successes at adapting European works were \"The Snowball\" at the Strand Theatre (1879), based on \"Oscar, ou le mari qui trompe sa femme\" by Eugène Scribe and Duvergne; \"In Honour Bound\" (1880), based on Scribe's \"Une Chaine\"; \"Dust\" at the Royalty Theatre (1881); \"The Glass of Fashion\" (1883); and \"A Wife's Sacrifice\" (1886). \"The Bells of Haslemere\", written with H. Pettitt, was a success at the Adelphi Theatre in 1887. He also created a farce in three acts, \"The Arabian Nights\" (1887), an adaptation of von Moser's \"Haroun al Raschid\"; \"Pompadour\", written with W. G. Wilts; and \"Mamma\" (1888), an adaptation of \"Les surprises du Divorce\".\n\nGrundy's original libretti included the one-act \"musical absurdity\" \"Popsy Wopsy\" (1880), the full-length \"The Vicar of Bray\" (1882) and \"Pocahontas\" (1884), both with Edward Solomon. These Solomon and Grundy comic operas toured extensively in both Britain and the US. His \"Haddon Hall\" (1892), with Sir Arthur Sullivan, dramatised the legend of Dorothy Vernon's elopement from Haddon Hall with John Manners.\n\nIn 1889–90 Grundy produced three original comedies, \"A White Lie\" at the Court Theatre, \"A Wife's Sacrifice\" and \"A Fool's Paradise\" at the Gaiety Theatre, which had been produced two years earlier as \"The Mouse-Trap\".\nLater successful adaptations included \"A Pair of Spectacles\" at the Garrick Theatre (1889, starring John Hare), from \"Les Petits Oiseaux\" of Labiche and Delacour. In 1890, Lilly Langtry presented Grundy's \"Esther Sandraz\" at the St. James's Theatre. This was followed by \"A Village Priest\" at the Haymarket Theatre (1890), from \"Le Secret de la terreuse\" (called \"The Broken Seal\" in America) a melodrama by Busnach and Cauvin; \"Sowing the Wind\" at the Comedy Theatre (1893); \"An Old Jew\" at the Garrick (1894); an adaptation of Octave Feuillet's \"Montjoye\", called \"A Bunch of Violets\" at the Haymarket (1894); \"The New Woman\" (1894); \"The Slaves of the Ring\" (1894); and \"The Greatest of These\" at the Garrick with the Kendals (1895).\n\nOther late notable works included \"The Greatest of These\" (1895); \"A Marriage of Convenience\" at the Haymarket (1897) from \"Un Mariage de Louis XV\", by Alexandre Dumas, père; \"The Silver Key\" at Her Majesty's Theatre (1897) from his \"Mlle de Belle-isle\"; and \"The Musqueteers\" (1899) from the same author's novel. These were followed by \"The Degenerates\" (1899, at the Haymarket, starring Langtry); \"A Debt of Honour\" at the St James's Theatre (1900); \"Frocks and Frills\" at the Haymarket (1902) from \"Doigts de fees\" of Scribe and Ernest Legouvé; \"The Garden of Lies\" at St James's (1904) from Justus Miles Forman's novel; \"Business is Business\" at His Majesty's (1905), a rather free adaptation from Octave Mirbeau's \"Les affaires sont les affaires\"; and \"The Diplomatists\" at the Royalty Theatre (1905) from \"La Poudre aux yeux\", by Labiche.\n\nAbout a dozen of Grundy's works played on Broadway, including \"A Pair of Spectacles\" in 1890 and 1905; \"The New Woman\" in 1894; \"A Bunch of Violets\" in 1895; \"The Late Mr. Castello\" in 1896; \"A Marriage of Convenience\" in 1897 and 1918; \"The Musketeers\" in 1899; \"The Degenerates\" in 1900; \"The Love Match\" in 1901; \"Frocks and Frills\" in 1902; \"Gypsy\" in 1903 and \"The Awakening\" in 1908. Several of Grundy's plays were made into films, including \"A Bunch of Violets\" and \"A Pair of Spectacles\", both in 1916; and \"Sowing the Wind\" in 1921. Many of Grundy's plays also had runs in Australia.\n\nGrundy died in London at the age of 66. His daughter, Lily, married the publisher and philanthropist Sir Bruce Ingram.\n\n"}

Early in the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on June 15, 1933, Congress passed an act to authorize the coinage of silver half dollars \"in commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary in 1936 of the independence of Texas, and of the noble and heroic sacrifices of her pioneers, whose revered memory has been an inspiration to her sons and daughters during the past century.\" This was the first of over two dozen commemorative bills that would become reality during Roosevelt's tenure. The legislation provided that \"no more than one and a half million pieces\" be created on behalf of the American Legion Texas Centennial Committee, located in Austin in that state.\n\nThe coin was designed by Pompeo Coppini, a Texan. The obverse depicts an Eagle sitting on a branch in front of the Lone Star, the symbol of Texas. At the top right of the star it reads IN GOD WE TRUST, and to the left of the star it reads E PLURIBUS UNUM. Over the star it reads UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and at the bottom it reads HALF DOLLAR.

It is held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, where it has been since 1952. It underwent extensive restoration in 1983.\n\nCaravaggio entered the household of Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte sometime in 1595, and \"The Musicians\" is thought to have been his first painting done expressly for the cardinal. His biographer, the painter Baglione, says he \"painted for the Cardinal youths playing music very well drawn from nature and also a youth playing a lute,\" the latter presumably being \"The Lute Player\", which seems to form a companion-piece to \"The Musicians\".\n\nThe picture shows four boys in quasi-Classical costume, three playing various musical instruments or singing, the fourth dressed as Cupid and reaching towards a bunch of grapes.\n\nCaravaggio seems to have composed the painting from studies of two figures. The central figure with the lute has been identified with Caravaggio's companion Mario Minniti, and the individual next to him and facing the viewer is possibly a self-portrait of the artist. The cupid bears a strong resemblance to the boy in \"Boy Peeling Fruit\", done a few years before, and also to the angel in \"Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy\".\n\nThe manuscripts show that the boys are practicing madrigals celebrating love, and the eyes of the lutenist, the principal figure, are moist with tears—the songs presumably describe the sorrow of love rather than its pleasures. The violin in the foreground suggests a fifth participant, implicitly including the viewer in the tableau.\n\nScenes showing musicians were a popular theme at the time—the Church was supporting a revival of music and new styles and forms were being tried, especially by educated and progressive prelates such as Del Monte. This scene, however, is clearly secular rather than religious, and harks back to the long-established tradition of \"concert\" pictures, a genre originating in Venice and exemplified, in its earlier form, by Titian's \"Le concert champêtre\".\n\nThis was Caravaggio's most ambitious and complex composition to date, and the artist has evidently had difficulties with painting the four figures separately—they don't relate to each other or to the picture-space, and the overall effect is somewhat clumsy. The painting is in poor condition, and the music in the manuscript has been badly damaged by past restorations, although a tenor and an alto part can be made out. Nevertheless, despite considerable paint loss, the work's originality remains undimmed.\n\n"}

{"id": "3733804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3733804", "title": "This Used to Be My Playground", "text": "This Used to Be My Playground\n\n\"This Used to Be My Playground\" is a song recorded by American singer Madonna. It is the theme for the film \"A League of Their Own\", which starred Madonna, and portrayed a fictionalized account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Madonna was asked to record a song for the film's soundtrack. At that time she was busy recording her fifth studio album, \"Erotica\", with producer Shep Pettibone. They worked on some ideas and came up with \"This Used to Be My Playground\" in two days. Once presented to director Penny Marshall's team, the song was released as a standalone single on June 16, 1992, by Warner Bros. Records. However, it was not available on the film's soundtrack due to contractual obligations and was later added to the Olympics-inspired \"Barcelona Gold\" compilation album, released that summer. The song was included on Madonna's 1995 ballads compilation \"Something to Remember\".\n\nWritten and produced by Madonna and Pettibone, \"This Used to Be My Playground\" was the first time that Pettibone worked with live string arrangement. Madonna recorded the song on a Shure SM57 microphone, with instrumentation from piano, organ, strings and a basic drum sounds. During the final recording, the duo had to redo the whole orchestra section to tailor it for the song. \"This Used to Be My Playground\" starts with a keyboard introduction and strings, with Madonna singing in expressive but subdued vocals. Its verse and chorus merge into each other for having a continuity in the song, but the track ends abruptly. Lyrically it discusses visiting one's childhood places and not letting go of the past.\n\nThe song received positive reviews from critics, who noted it as an essential addition in Madonna's repertoire. The song earned the singer a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Song. It was a commercial success, reaching number-one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100; the track was Madonna's tenth chart-topping single, breaking her tie with Whitney Houston to become the female artist with the most number one singles at that time. It also reached the top of the charts in Canada, Finland, Italy and Sweden, while reaching the top-ten of the charts in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1992, Madonna starred in the Penny Marshall directed film \"A League of Their Own\", which portrayed a fictionalized account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL). Columbia Records representatives presented music supervisor Jay Landers with the film's script. Together with Michael Dilbeck, head of music for Columbia Pictures, they decided to compose a soundtrack for the film. According to Landers, Marshall being well connected to the music community also helped them choose the artists they wanted to work with. The director wanted the music and songs to be performed by contemporary artists, but catering to the period of 1943–44, which was the film's timeline. Carole King had already written the opening song for \"A League of Their Own\", and Madonna being associated with it, Columbia wanted her to record another song. Lars recalled that there was some \"early hesitation\" if Madonna's character should be kept the same or separated from that in the film and the song, and in the end they decided to go with the latter concept.\n\nAfter the shooting was over, Madonna was busy in the recording sessions for her fifth studio album, \"Erotica\" with producer Shep Pettibone. Throughout January–March 1992, Madonna and Pettibone worked on demos for the album and finally decided on 15 of them. When Lars called Madonna and asked her to record a song for the film, the singer and Pettibone had just completed working on the ballad \"Rain\". Madonna admitted that she did not have any material for the film and Lars explained that Marshall wanted only a ballad. Pettibone composed a track the same night and Madonna had some ideas she wanted to incorporate. She came up with the melody of \"This Used to Be My Playground\" by humming over computer-generated chords and rewrote a string arrangement while an orchestra waited in the studio. During an interview with \"The Guardian\", Madonna described the process as \"assignment writing\" since it was completely separate from her \"Erotica\" sessions. It took them two days to write and produce the song, and the final version was submitted to Marshall's team. Lars recalled that they \"immediately loved it... We all thought it would be a very successful record and we knew right away it would be perfect.\"\n\nDue to contractual reasons, the track could not be included on the official \"A League of Their Own\" soundtrack; instead, it was included on the compilation \"Barcelona Gold\", which was released to promote the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics. \"This Used to Be My Playground\" was officially released as a standalone single to promote the film, on June 16, 1992, by Warner Bros. Records. The song was later included on the 1995 ballad compilation album \"Something to Remember\".\n\nRecording the track was a new experience for Pettibone since it was the first time that he worked with live musicians and arrangements. Pettibone took the demo of the song, and added live drums, piano and strings to it. They did not have any strings written originally for the song, and chose composer Jeremy Lubbock for the music arrangement; Lubbock had previously worked with Madonna on her soundtrack album \"I'm Breathless\" (1990). Madonna recorded the song on a Shure SM57 microphone, with the melody being played over and over again, accompanied by the piano, organ, strings and a basic rim-looping sound on a portable Macintosh computer. Pettibone spent the rest of the recording session working on the verses and final structure of \"This Used to Be My Playground\" was completed. The day after the song was finished, Madonna traveled to Oregon to work on her next film, \"Body of Evidence\", giving Pettibone the time to finish off the songs for \"Erotica\".\nThe duo met again in May 1992 at Oceanway Studios in Los Angeles to complete the orchestration of the song. Lubbock's arrangement was chosen for adding the final touches and the recording started. However, Madonna and Pettibone did not like the orchestra parts and wanted to redo the whole composition. The producer recalled, \"Madonna and I had to change the whole arrangement, right there in the studio, with a full orchestra sitting there getting paid for taking up space—around $15,000 for three hours, $3000 for every half-hour over that. And of course, Lubbock was talking to two people who didn't know a C from a B natural. The pressure was on\". So they stood near Pettibone's Mac and sang the notes, with Lubbock correcting them. The total recording was finished off in 2 hours and 58 minutes, thereby saving to pay the orchestra the extra fees. The last recording of the song was on Memorial Day where Madonna re-did the lead vocals and improved them. Together they did some final edits of the track and finished it.\n\n\"This Used to Be My Playground\" features a keyboard introduction, followed by the strings and the song starts. Musically, the song is set in the time signature of common time with a slow tempo of 77 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G minor with Madonna vocals ranging from the chords of G to B. The song follows a basic sequence of Gm–F/G–Emaj–Dm–Gsus–G as its chord progression. The chords have an unexpected flow in terms of the beginning and the ending, moving from E down to Gm and momentarily to F major, then going back to the previous sequence again. The song has a lush, romantic quality, with the melody going through different ranges and peaks, and the verse and the chorus flow into each other, making it sound seamless. Madonna sings in subdued but expressive vocals, aided by the strings and background singers during the third verse. Towards the end the singer's voice is double tracked and produces little amount of roughness. Lyrically the song talks about Madonna revisiting the places from her childhood (\"This used to be my playground / This used to be my childhood dream\"), and evokes the songwriting on her fourth studio album, \"Like a Prayer\" (1989). The singer is in a dilemma between choosing the past and letting go, concluding that the latter is difficult (\"Say goodbye to yesterday (the dream) / Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say))\". The track has a sudden ending with the orchestra and the backing vocal uttering \"Wishing you were here with me\", the line addressed to Madonna's mother.\n\nAfter its release, \"This Used to Be My Playground\" received positive reviews from music critics. J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of \"\", called the track a \"melancholic performance\". Michelle Morgan, author of the book \"Madonna\", described it as a \"beautiful ballad\". Similarly, Humberto Quiroga Lavié called it one of Madonna's best ballads in his essay \"Secretos y Misterios de Hombres y Mujeres\". Author Rikky Rooksby wrote in his book \"The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna\", that the song was appropriate for the film and its nostalgic moment towards the end, showing the characters grown up and reuniting at a museum opened for themselves and the titular league. He called it \"one of Madonna's very best recordings and most expressive single\". While reviewing \"Something to Remember\", author Chris Wade wrote in his book \"The Music of Madonna\", that the song conjured up a \"strangely sad, nostalgic feel, reminding ourselves of memories from yesteryear\". He commended Madonna's vocals calling it as the song's \"premier sound\" and adding that the way \"she sings and captures the melancholic melody is heartbreaking [...] it's one of her finest ever ballads.\" \"Encyclopedia Madonnica\" writer and journalist Matthew Rettenmund noted in the book that the song's rise to the top of the charts was aided by its \"honest delivery and aching sense of loneliness, regret and nostalgia for friendship lost.\"\n\nMatthew Jacobs from \"The Huffington Post\", placed it at number 32 on his list \"The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles\". He wrote: \"What's surprising is that this heartfelt ballad's release was sandwiched between 'Justify My Love' and 'Erotica', which corroborates the many checkered crowns that Madonna can wear\". Similarly, AllMusic's Jose F. Promis called it \"a quiet predecessor to her most notorious album \"Erotica\"\". Promis also believed that the single version of the song was worth of collecting since it was not released in CD version in the United States. Sal Cinquemani from \"Slant Magazine\", called it one of the singer's \"soundtrack gems\". Writing for the \"Deseret News\", Chris Hicks called the song \"a lovely change-of-pace number\" for Madonna.\n\nLouis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed \"This Used to Be My Playground\" at number 52 of his list \"The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs\". He wrote; \"The theme to Madonna’s best movie is nostalgic and sweet, and it gave her a major hit that utilized the lachrymose qualities in her voice.\" Mary Ann A. Bautist, from the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\", called it one of the singer's \"alternative tunes [...] that can be as romantic and touching as any ballad\". Liz Smith, from \"The Toledo Blade\", called it an \"exquisite ballad\". On his review of the compilation \"Barcelona Gold\", \"The Daily Gazette\"s Bill Rice wrote: \"Madonna's plaintive single 'This Used to Be My Playground', is one medal winner\". A negative review came from \"Stylus Magazine\"s Alfred Soto, who dismissed the song as a \"slushy rewrite of \"Like a Prayer\"s 'Promise to Try'\". The song was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Original Song, but lost to \"A Whole New World\" from \"Aladdin\". It won two accolades at the ASCAP Awards, in the categories of Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures and Most Performed Pop Song.\n\nIn the United States, \"This Used to Be My Playground\" debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart at number 35, for the week of July 4, 1992. The debut was aided by just airplay points which enabled it to enter the Hot 100 Airplay chart at number 14. The song received immediate heavy rotation in US radio stations like Hot 97 in New York and Wild 107 in San Francisco. One week later, the song jumped to number 17 on the Hot 100, having had the largest sales and airplay points of any record on the chart. On August 8, 1992, the song reached the top of the chart for one week, becoming Madonna's tenth number one single, breaking her tie with Whitney Houston as the female artist with the most number one singles at that time. The song replaced \"Baby Got Back\" by Sir Mix-a-Lot although it was number three on the Hot Singles Sales and Hot 100 Airplay charts. According to Michael Ellis from \"Billboard\", the song edged out \"Baby Got Back\" by a small margin of chart points. The song spent a total of 20 weeks on the chart and ranked at number 21 on the Hot 100 year end chart for 1992.\n\n\"This Used to Be My Playground\" also reached peak positions of number two on the Hot 100 Airplay and number four on the Adult Contemporary charts. On September 10, 1992, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000 copies. \"Billboard\" ranked it at number 22 on their list of \"Madonna's 40 Biggest Hits\" on the Hot 100. In Canada, the song debuted at number 60 on the \"RPM\" Top Singles chart on July 4, 1992. After seven weeks it reached the top of the chart and was present for a total of 19 weeks. It also reached number two on the \"RPM\" Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song debuted at number five on the UK Singles Chart, and reached a peak of number three the week of August 25, 1992, and was present on the top 100 for a total of 9 weeks. It was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on September 1, 1992, for shipments of 200,000 copies. The single has sold over 275,000 copies as of October 2010. The song also achieved great success across Europe, hitting number one in various countries including Italy, Finland, and Sweden and charting within the top ten in other countries. It resulted in the song achieving a peak of number two on the European Hot 100 Singles chart. In Australia the song reached a peak of number nine on the ARIA Charts and received a gold certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 35,000 copies.\n\nThe accompanying music video, directed by Alek Keshishian, was filmed in June 1992 at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California and Malibu Beach. It premiered on MTV on June 30, 1992, a day before the release of \"A League of Their Own\". The video shows a man viewing a photo album, as Madonna sings in different settings from within the various pictures. Scenes from \"A League of Their Own\" also appear on the album during and after the song's instrumental break. As the video ends, the man having reached the end of the album, then scrolls backwards through the previous pages. As a whole, the video wherein a man viewing a photo album tells of bringing back childhood memories, but even tells that never hold on to the past. The video was commercially released in 2004 as a bonus feature on the 2-disc special edition DVD of \"A League of Their Own\".\n\nAccording to Rettenmund, unlike most music videos related to film soundtracks, \"This Used to Be My Playground\" did not give emphasis on having shots from the film in the video itself. Instead Keshishian and Madonna chose introspection as the theme, with simple images to portray them. Rettenmund notes, \"At the end, the man who has been looking back at his scrapbook of Madonna lays his head down, sealing the video with the perfect bit of sadness to resonate with Madonna's ennui.\"\n\nThe video has been compared to Boy George's video for his 1987 single, \"To Be Reborn\", released less than five years before \"This Used to Be My Playground\". In George's video, he also appears on pages of a photo album, performing the song. George himself stated in his autobiography that he was \"furious\" after watching Madonna's video and renamed it \"This Used to Be My Video\".\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Something to Remember\" and the single release of \"This Used to Be My Playground\".\n\n"}
