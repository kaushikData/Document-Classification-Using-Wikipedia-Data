This is closely related to his manifesto \"The School of the South\" in which he states “I have called this “The School of the South” because in reality, our north is the south. There must not be north for us, except in opposition to our south. Therefore we now turn the map upside down, and then we have a true idea of our position, and not as the rest of the world wishes. The point of America, from now on, forever, insistently points to the South, our north.”\n\nCritics have interpreted the image as a sociopolitical artistic work intended to counter American cultural imperialism and other cartographic and cultural norms rooted in the European colonization of the Americas. \n\nThe work has become an iconic in Uruguayan popular culture. \n"}
{"id": "1078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1078", "title": "Antisemitism", "text": "Antisemitism\n\nAntisemitism (also spelled anti-Semitism or anti-semitism) is hostility to, prejudice, or discrimination against Jews. A person who holds such positions is called an antisemite. Antisemitism is generally considered to be a form of racism. It has also been characterized as a political ideology which serves as an organizing principle and unites disparate groups which are opposed to liberalism.\n\nAntisemitism may be manifested in many ways, ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual Jews to organized pogroms by mobs, state police, or even military attacks on entire Jewish communities. Although the term did not come into common usage until the 19th century, it is now also applied to historic anti-Jewish incidents. Notable instances of persecution include the Rhineland massacres preceding the First Crusade in 1096, the Edict of Expulsion from England in 1290, the massacres of Spanish Jews in 1391, the persecutions of the Spanish Inquisition, the expulsion from Spain in 1492, the Cossack massacres in Ukraine from 1648 to 1657, various anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire between 1821 and 1906, the 1894–1906 Dreyfus affair in France, the Holocaust in German-occupied Europe during World War II, Soviet anti-Jewish policies, and Arab and Muslim involvement in the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries.\n\nThe root word \"\" gives the false impression that antisemitism is directed against all Semitic people, \"e.g.\", including Arabs and Assyrians. The compound word \"antisemite\" was popularized in Germany in 1879 as a scientific-sounding term for \"Judenhass\" (\"Jew-hatred\"), and this has been its common use since then.\n\nThe origin of \"antisemitic\" terminologies is found in the responses of Moritz Steinschneider to the views of Ernest Renan. As Alex Bein writes: \"The compound anti-Semitism appears to have been used first by Steinschneider, who challenged Renan on account of his 'anti-Semitic prejudices' [i.e., his derogation of the \"Semites\" as a race].\" Avner Falk similarly writes: 'The German word \"antisemitisch\" was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider (1816–1907) in the phrase \"antisemitische Vorurteile\" (antisemitic prejudices). Steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the French philosopher Ernest Renan's false ideas about how \"Semitic races\" were inferior to \"Aryan races\"'.\n\nPseudoscientific theories concerning race, civilization, and \"progress\" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as Prussian nationalistic historian Heinrich von Treitschke did much to promote this form of racism. He coined the phrase \"the Jews are our misfortune\" which would later be widely used by Nazis. According to Avner Falk, Treitschke uses the term \"Semitic\" almost synonymously with \"Jewish\", in contrast to Renan's use of it to refer to a whole range of peoples, based generally on linguistic criteria.\n\nAccording to Jonathan M. Hess, the term was originally used by its authors to \"stress the radical difference between their own 'antisemitism' and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism.\"\n\nIn 1879 German journalist Wilhelm Marr published a pamphlet, \"Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet\" (\"The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective\") in which he used the word \"Semitismus\" interchangeably with the word \"Judentum\" to denote both \"Jewry\" (the Jews as a collective) and \"jewishness\" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit).\n\nThis use of \"\" was followed by a coining of \"\" which was used to indicate opposition to the Jews as a people and opposition to the Jewish spirit, which Marr interpreted as infiltrating German culture. His next pamphlet, \"Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums über das Judenthum\" (\"The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit\", 1880), presents a development of Marr's ideas further and may present the first published use of the German word \" Antisemitismus\", \"antisemitism\".\n\nThe pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the \"Antisemiten-Liga\" (League of Antisemites), apparently named to follow the \"Anti-Kanzler-Liga\" (Anti-Chancellor League). The league was the first German organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their forced removal from the country.\n\nSo far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published \"Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte\", and Wilhelm Scherer used the term \"Antisemiten\" in the January issue of \"Neue Freie Presse\".\n\nThe Jewish Encyclopedia reports, \"In February 1881, a correspondent of the \"Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums\" speaks of 'Anti-Semitism' as a designation which recently came into use (\"Allg. Zeit. d. Jud.\" 1881, p. 138). On 19 July 1882, the editor says, 'This quite recent Anti-Semitism is hardly three years old.'\"\n\nThe related term \"philosemitism\" was coined around 1885.\n\nFrom the outset the term anti-Semitism bore special racial connotations and meant specifically prejudice against Jews. The term is confusing, for in modern usage 'Semitic' designates a language group, not a race. In this sense, the term is a misnomer, since there are many speakers of Semitic languages (e.g. Arabs, Ethiopians, and Assyrians) who are not the objects of anti-Semitic prejudices, while there are many Jews who do not speak Hebrew, a Semitic language. Though 'antisemitism' has been used to describe prejudice against people who speak other Semitic languages, the validity of such usage has been questioned.\n\nThe term may be spelled with or without a hyphen (antisemitism or anti-Semitism). Some scholars favor the unhyphenated form because, \"If you use the hyphenated form, you consider the words 'Semitism', 'Semite', 'Semitic' as meaningful\" whereas \"in antisemitic parlance, 'Semites' really stands for Jews, just that.\" For example, Emil Fackenheim supported the unhyphenated spelling, in order to \"[dispel] the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes.\" Others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at Merrimack College; Yehuda Bauer, professor of Holocaust studies at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at Hebrew University of Jerusalem; and James Carroll, historian and novelist. According to Carroll, who first cites O'Hare and Bauer on \"the existence of something called 'Semitism'\", \"the hyphenated word thus reflects the bipolarity that is at the heart of the problem of antisemitism\".\n\nObjections to the usage of the term, such as the obsolete nature of the term Semitic as a racial term, have been raised since at least the 1930s.\n\nThough the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, and, according to Olaf Blaschke, has become an \"umbrella term for negative stereotypes about Jews\", a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions.\n\nHolocaust scholar and City University of New York professor Helen Fein defines it as \"a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions—social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violence—which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews.\"\n\nElaborating on Fein's definition, Dietz Bering of the University of Cologne writes that, to antisemites, \"Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character.\"\n\nFor Sonja Weinberg, as distinct from economic and religious anti-Judaism, antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to 'science' to defend itself, new functional forms and organisational differences. It was anti-liberal, racialist and nationalist. It promoted the myth that Jews conspired to 'judaise' the world; it served to consolidate social identity; it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system; and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism.\nBernard Lewis defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of \"cosmic evil.\" Thus, \"it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic\" unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.\n\nThere have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally. The United States Department of State states that \"while there is no universally accepted definition, there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses.\" For the purposes of its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism, the term was considered to mean \"hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity.\"\n\nIn 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (now Fundamental Rights Agency), then an agency of the European Union, developed a more detailed working definition, which states: \"Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\" It also adds that \"such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity,\" but that \"criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.\" It provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; denying the Holocaust or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of dual loyalty or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel. Late in 2013, the definition was removed from the website of the Fundamental Rights Agency. A spokesperson said that it had never been regarded as official and that the agency did not intend to develop its own definition. However, despite its disappearance from the website of the Fundamental Rights Agency, the definition has gained widespread international use. The definition has been adopted by the European Parliament Working Group on Antisemitism, in 2010 it was adopted by the United States Department of State, in 2014 it was adopted in the Operational Hate Crime Guidance of the UK College of Policing and was also adopted by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, and in 2016 it was adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, making it the most widely adopted definition of antisemitism around the world.\nIn 1879, Wilhelm Marr founded the \"Antisemiten-Liga\" (Anti-Semitic League). Identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in Europe during the late 19th century. For example, Karl Lueger, the popular mayor of fin de siècle Vienna, skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage. In its 1910 obituary of Lueger, \"The New York Times\" notes that Lueger was \"Chairman of the Christian Social Union of the Parliament and of the Anti-Semitic Union of the Diet of Lower Austria. In 1895 A. C. Cuza organized the \"Alliance Anti-semitique Universelle\" in Bucharest. In the period before World War II, when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace, it was not uncommon for a person, an organization, or a political party to self-identify as an antisemite or antisemitic.\n\nThe early Zionist pioneer Leon Pinsker, a professional physician, preferred the clinical-sounding term \"Judeophobia\" to antisemitism, which he regarded as a misnomer. The word \"Judeophobia\" first appeared in his pamphlet \"Auto-Emancipation\", published anonymously in German in September 1882, where it was described as an irrational fear or hatred of Jews. According to Pinsker, this irrational fear was an inherited predisposition. \n\nIn the aftermath of the Kristallnacht pogrom in 1938, German propaganda minister Goebbels announced: \"The German people is anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race.\"\n\nAfter the 1945 victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany, and particularly after the full extent of the Nazi genocide against the Jews became known, the term \"anti-Semitism\" acquired pejorative connotations. This marked a full circle shift in usage, from an era just decades earlier when \"Jew\" was used as a pejorative term. Yehuda Bauer wrote in 1984: \"There are no anti-Semites in the world ... Nobody says, 'I am anti-Semitic.' You cannot, after Hitler. The word has gone out of fashion.\"\n\nAntisemitism manifests itself in a variety of ways. René König mentions social antisemitism, economic antisemitism, religious antisemitism, and political antisemitism as examples. König points out that these different forms demonstrate that the \"origins of anti-Semitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods.\" König asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create \"serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of anti-Semitism.\" These difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism. The forms identified are substantially the same; it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ. Bernard Lazare identifies three forms of antisemitism: Christian antisemitism, economic antisemitism, and ethnologic antisemitism.\nWilliam Brustein names four categories: religious, racial, economic and political. The Roman Catholic historian Edward Flannery distinguished four varieties of antisemitism:\n\nLouis Harap separates \"economic antisemitism\" and merges \"political\" and \"nationalistic\" antisemitism into \"ideological antisemitism\". Harap also adds a category of \"social antisemitism\".\n\nGustavo Perednik has argued that what he terms \"Judeophobia\" has a number of unique traits which set it apart from other forms of racism, including permanence, depth, obsessiveness, irrationality, endurance, ubiquity, and danger. He also wrote in his book \"The Judeophobia\" that \"The Jews were accused by the nationalists of being the creators of Communism; by the Communists of ruling Capitalism. If they live in non-Jewish countries, they are accused of double-loyalties; if they live in the Jewish country, of being racists. When they spend their money, they are reproached for being ostentatious; when they don't spend their money, of being avaricious. They are called rootless cosmopolitans or hardened chauvinists. If they assimilate, they are accused of being fifth-columnists, if they don't, of shutting themselves away.\"\n\nHarvard professor Ruth Wisse has argued that antisemitism is a political ideology that authoritarians use to consolidate power by unifying disparate groups. One example she gives is the alleged antisemitism within the United Nations, which, in this view, functioned during the Cold War as a coalition-building technique between Soviet and Arab states, but now serves the same purpose among states opposed to the type of human-rights ideology for which the UN was created. She also cites as an example the formation of the Arab League.\n\nLouis Harap defines cultural antisemitism as \"that species of anti-Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform, crude, \"Jewish\" culture. Similarly, Eric Kandel characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of \"Jewishness\" as a \"religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning, through distinctive traditions and education.\" According to Kandel, this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing \"unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation.\" Niewyk and Nicosia characterize cultural antisemitism as focusing on and condemning \"the Jews' aloofness from the societies in which they live.\"\nAn important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of Judaism to be redeemable by education or by religious conversion.\n\nReligious antisemitism, also known as anti-Judaism, is antipathy towards Jews because of their perceived religious beliefs. In theory, antisemitism and attacks against individual Jews would stop if Jews stopped practicing Judaism or changed their public faith, especially by conversion to the official or right religion. However, in some cases discrimination continues after conversion, as in the case of Christianized \"Marranos\" or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.\n\nAlthough the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo-Christian conflict, other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times. Frederick Schweitzer asserts that, \"most scholars ignore the Christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism, cultural antisemitism, racism or racial antisemitism, economic antisemitism and the like.\" William Nichols draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds: \"The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion [...] a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism.\" From the perspective of racial antisemitism, however, \"the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.[...] From the Enlightenment onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews[...] Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear.\"\n\nSome Christians such as the Catholic priest Ernest Jouin, who published the first French translation of the \"Protocols\", combined religious and racial anti-Semitism, as in his statement that \"From the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity.\" The virulent anti-Semitism of Édouard Drumont, one of the most widely read Catholic writers in France during the Dreyfus Affair, likewise combined religious and racial anti-Semitism.\n\nThe underlying premise of economic antisemitism is that Jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by Jews.\n\nLinking Jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting Antisemitic canards. Antisemites claim that Jews control the world finances, a theory promoted in the fraudulent Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and later repeated by Henry Ford and his Dearborn Independent. In the modern era, such myths continue to be spread in books such as \"The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews\" published by the Nation of Islam, and on the internet.\nDerek Penslar writes that there are two components to the financial canards:\n\nAbraham Foxman describes six facets of the financial canards:\n\nGerald Krefetz summarizes the myth as \"[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses—of the community, of the country, of the world\". Krefetz gives, as illustrations, many slurs and proverbs (in several different languages) which suggest that Jews are stingy, or greedy, or miserly, or aggressive bargainers. During the nineteenth century, Jews were described as \"scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted\", but after the Jewish Emancipation and the rise of Jews to the middle- or upper-class in Europe were portrayed as \"clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate [world finances]\".\n\nLéon Poliakov asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism). In opposition to this view, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, the economic antisemitism is \"distinct and nearly constant\" but theological antisemitism is \"often subdued\".\n\nAn academic study by Francesco D'Acunto, Marcel Prokopczuk, and Michael Weber showed that people who live in areas of Germany that contain the most brutal history of anti-Semitic persecution are more likely to be distrustful of finance in general. Therefore, they tended to invest less money in the stock market and make poor financial decisions. The study concluded \"that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the long-term wealth of the persecuted, but of the persecutors as well.\"\n\nRacial antisemitism is prejudice against Jews as a racial/ethnic group, rather than Judaism as a religion.\n\nRacial antisemitism is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the eugenics movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or \"Aryans\", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.\n\nRacial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the Industrial Revolution, following the Jewish Emancipation, Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing nationalism, the rise of eugenics, and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.\n\nAccording to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds. \"The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism.\" However, with racial antisemitism, \"Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism... From the Enlightenment onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear.\"\n\nIn the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries. The old laws restricting them to ghettos, as well as the many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded. Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by racial antisemitism, encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as Joseph Arthur de Gobineau and particularly his \"Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race\" of 1853–5. Nationalist agendas based on ethnicity, known as ethnonationalism, usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race. Allied to this were theories of Social Darwinism, which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by northern Europeans, advocated the superiority of white Aryans to Semitic Jews.\n\nWilliam Brustein defines political antisemitism as hostility toward Jews based on the belief that Jews seek national and/or world power.\" Yisrael Gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to \"lay responsibility on the Jews for defeats and political economic crises\" while seeking to \"exploit opposition and resistance to Jewish influence as elements in political party platforms.\"\n\nAccording to Viktor Karády, political antisemitism became widespread after the legal emancipation of the Jews and sought to reverse some of the consequences of that emancipation.\nHolocaust denial and Jewish conspiracy theories are also considered forms of antisemitism. Zoological conspiracy theories have been propagated by Arab media and Arabic language websites, alleging a \"Zionist plot\" behind the use of animals to attack civilians or to conduct espionage.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, some scholars have advanced the concept of new antisemitism, coming simultaneously from the left, the right, and radical Islam, which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the State of Israel, and they argue that the language of anti-Zionism and criticism of Israel are used to attack Jews more broadly. In this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that criticisms of Israel and Zionism are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute this to antisemitism. Jewish scholar Gustavo Perednik posited in 2004 that anti-Zionism in itself represents a form of discrimination against Jews, in that it singles out Jewish national aspirations as an illegitimate and racist endeavor, and \"proposes actions that would result in the death of millions of Jews\". It is asserted that the new antisemitism deploys traditional antisemitic motifs, including older motifs such as the blood libel.\n\nCritics of the concept view it as trivializing the meaning of antisemitism, and as exploiting antisemitism in order to silence debate and to deflect attention from legitimate criticism of the State of Israel, and, by associating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, misused to taint anyone opposed to Israeli actions and policies.\n\nGerman indologists arbitrarily identified \"layers\" in the Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita with the objective of fueling European anti-Semitism via the Indo-Aryan migration theory. This identification required equating Brahmins with Jews, resulting in anti-Brahmanism.\n\nMany authors see the roots of modern antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early Christianity. Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:\n\nChanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: \"ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; Christian antisemitism, which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\"\n\nThe first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced to the 3rd century BCE to Alexandria, the home to the largest Jewish diaspora community in the world at the time and where the Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, was produced. Manetho, an Egyptian priest and historian of that era, wrote scathingly of the Jews. His themes are repeated in the works of Chaeremon, Lysimachus, Poseidonius, Apollonius Molon, and in Apion and Tacitus. Agatharchides of Cnidus ridiculed the practices of the Jews and the \"absurdity of their Law\", making a mocking reference to how Ptolemy Lagus was able to invade Jerusalem in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the \"Shabbat\". One of the earliest anti-Jewish edicts, promulgated by Antiochus IV Epiphanes in about 170–167 BCE, sparked a revolt of the Maccabees in Judea.\n\nIn view of Manetho's anti-Jewish writings, antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by \"the Greek retelling of Ancient Egyptian prejudices\". The ancient Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died. The violence in Alexandria may have been caused by the Jews being portrayed as misanthropes. Tcherikover argues that the reason for hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities, the \"poleis\". Bohak has argued, however, that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti-Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone, and that many Greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians.\nStatements exhibiting prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many pagan Greek and Roman writers. Edward Flannery writes that it was the Jews' refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. Hecataetus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses \"in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life.\" Manetho, an Egyptian historian, wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian lepers who had been taught by Moses \"not to adore the gods.\" Edward Flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially \"cultural, taking the shape of a national xenophobia played out in political settings.\"\n\nThere are examples of Hellenistic rulers desecrating the Temple and banning Jewish religious practices, such as circumcision, Shabbat observance, study of Jewish religious books, etc. Examples may also be found in anti-Jewish riots in Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE.\n\nThe Jewish diaspora on the Nile island Elephantine, which was founded by mercenaries, experienced the destruction of its temple in 410 BCE.\n\nRelationships between the Jewish people and the occupying Roman Empire were at times antagonistic and resulted in several rebellions. According to Suetonius, the emperor Tiberius expelled from Rome Jews who had gone to live there. The 18th-century English historian Edward Gibbon identified a more tolerant period in Roman-Jewish relations beginning in about 160 CE. However, when Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire, the state's attitude towards the Jews gradually worsened.\n\nJames Carroll asserted: \"Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the Roman Empire. By that ratio, if other factors such as pogroms and conversions had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million.\"\n\nIn the late 6th century CE, the newly Catholicised Visigothic kingdom in Hispania issued a series of anti-Jewish edicts which forbad Jews from marrying Christians, practicing circumcision, and observing Jewish holy days. Continuing throughout the 7th century, both Visigothic kings and the Church were active in creating social aggression and towards Jews with \"civic and ecclesiastic punishments\", ranging between forced conversion, slavery, exile and death.\n\nFrom the 9th century, the medieval Islamic world classified Jews and Christians as \"dhimmis\", and allowed Jews to practice their religion more freely than they could do in medieval Christian Europe. Under Islamic rule, there was a Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain that lasted until at least the 11th century. It ended when several Muslim pogroms against Jews took place on the Iberian Peninsula, including those that occurred in Córdoba in 1011 and in Granada in 1066. Several decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were also enacted in Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Yemen from the 11th century. In addition, Jews were forced to convert to Islam or face death in some parts of Yemen, Morocco and Baghdad several times between the 12th and 18th centuries. The Almohads, who had taken control of the Almoravids' Maghribi and Andalusian territories by 1147, were far more fundamentalist in outlook compared to their predecessors, and they treated the \"dhimmis\" harshly. Faced with the choice of either death or conversion, many Jews and Christians emigrated. Some, such as the family of Maimonides, fled east to more tolerant Muslim lands, while some others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages in Europe there was persecution against Jews in many places, with blood libels, expulsions, forced conversions and massacres. A main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious.\n\nThe persecution hit its first peak during the Crusades. In the First Crusade (1096) hundreds or even thousands of Jews were killed as the crusaders arrived. This was the first major outbreak of anti-Jewish violence in Christian Europe outside Spain and was cited by Zionists in the 19th century as indicating the need for a state of Israel.\n\nIn the Second Crusade (1147) the Jews in Germany were subject to several massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the Shepherds' Crusades of 1251 and 1320, as well as Rintfleisch knights in 1298. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including, in 1290, the banishing of all English Jews; in 1394, the expulsion of 100,000 Jews in France; and in 1421, the expulsion of thousands from Austria. Many of the expelled Jews fled to Poland. In medieval and Renaissance Europe, a major contributor to the deepening of antisemitic sentiment and legal action among the Christian populations was the popular preaching of the zealous reform religious orders, the Franciscans (especially Bernardino of Feltre) and Dominicans (especially Vincent Ferrer), who combed Europe and promoted antisemitism through their often fiery, emotional appeals.\n\nAs the Black Death epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, causing the death of a large part of the population, Jews were used as scapegoats. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed in numerous persecutions. Although Pope Clement VI tried to protect them by issuing two papal bulls in 1348, the first on 6 July and an additional one several months later, 900 Jews were burned alive in Strasbourg, where the plague had not yet affected the city.\n\nDuring the mid-to-late 17th century the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people), and Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands. The first of these conflicts was the Khmelnytsky Uprising, when Bohdan Khmelnytsky's supporters massacred tens of thousands of Jews in the eastern and southern areas he controlled (today's Ukraine). The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and captivity in the Ottoman Empire, called \"jasyr\".\n\nEuropean immigrants to the United States brought antisemitism to the country as early as the 17th century. Peter Stuyvesant, the Dutch governor of New Amsterdam, implemented plans to prevent Jews from settling in the city. During the Colonial Era, the American government limited the political and economic rights of Jews. It was not until the American Revolutionary War that Jews gained legal rights, including the right to vote. However, even at their peak, the restrictions on Jews in the United States were never as stringent as they had been in Europe.\n\nIn the Zaydi imamate of Yemen, Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of Tihamah and which became known as the Mawza Exile.\n\nIn 1744, Frederick II of Prussia limited the number of Jews allowed to live in Breslau to only ten so-called \"protected\" Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other Prussian cities. In 1750 he issued the \"Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft\": the \"protected\" Jews had an alternative to \"either abstain from marriage or leave Berlin\" (quoting Simon Dubnow). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria Maria Theresa ordered Jews out of Bohemia but soon reversed her position, on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years. This extortion was known as \"malke-geld\" (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, Joseph II abolished most of these persecution practices in his \"Toleranzpatent\", on the condition that Yiddish and Hebrew were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled. Moses Mendelssohn wrote that \"Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution.\"\n\nAccording to Arnold Ages, Voltaire's \"Lettres philosophiques, Dictionnaire philosophique, and Candide, to name but a few of his better known works, are saturated with comments on Jews and Judaism and the vast majority are negative\". Paul H. Meyer adds: \"There is no question but that Voltaire, particularly in his latter years, nursed a violent hatred of the Jews and it is equally certain that his animosity...did have a considerable impact on public opinion in France.\" Thirty of the 118 articles in Voltaire's \"Dictionnaire Philosophique\" concerned Jews and described them in consistently negative ways.\n\nThe counter-revolutionary Catholic royalist Louis de Bonald stands out among the earliest figures to explicitly call for the reversal of Jewish emancipation in the wake of the French Revolution. Bonald's attacks on the Jews are likely to have influenced Napoleon's decision to limit the civil rights of Alsatian Jews. Bonald's article \"Sur les juifs\" (1806) was one of the most venomous screeds of its era and furnished a paradigm which combined anti-liberalism, a defense of a rural society, traditional Christian antisemitism, and the identification of Jews with bankers and finance capital, which would in turn influence many subsequent right-wing reactionaries such as Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux, Charles Maurras, and Édouard Drumont, nationalists such as Maurice Barrès and Paolo Orano, and anti-Semitic socialists such as Alphonse Toussenel. Bonald furthermore declared that the Jews were an \"alien\" people, a \"state within a state\", and should be forced to wear a distinctive mark to more easily identify and discriminate against them.\n\nUnder the French Second Empire, the popular counter-revolutionary Catholic journalist Louis Veuillot propagated Bonald's arguments against the Jewish \"financial aristocracy\" along with vicious attacks against the Talmud and the Jews as a \"deicidal people\" driven by hatred to \"enslave\" Christians. Between 1882 and 1886 alone, French priests published twenty antisemitic books blaming France's ills on the Jews and urging the government to consign them back to the ghettos, expel them, or hang them from the gallows. Gougenot des Mousseaux's \"Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens\" (1869) has been called a \"Bible of modern antisemitism\" and was translated into German by Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg.\n\nThousands of Jews were slaughtered by Cossack Haidamaks in the 1768 massacre of Uman in the Kingdom of Poland. In 1772, the empress of Russia Catherine II forced the Jews into the Pale of Settlement – which was located primarily in present-day Poland, Ukraine and Belarus – and to stay in their shtetls and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the partition of Poland. From 1804, Jews were banned from their villages, and began to stream into the towns. A decree by emperor Nicholas I of Russia in 1827 conscripted Jews under 18 years of age into the cantonist schools for a 25-year military service in order to promote baptism.\nPolicy towards Jews was liberalised somewhat under Czar Alexander II (). However, his assassination in 1881 served as a pretext for further repression such as the May Laws of 1882. Konstantin Pobedonostsev, nicknamed the \"black czar\" and tutor to the czarevitch, later crowned Czar Nicholas II, declared that \"One third of the Jews must die, one third must emigrate, and one third be converted to Christianity\".\n\nHistorian Martin Gilbert writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in Muslim countries. Benny Morris writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: \"I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish gaberdine. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan.\"\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, J. J. Benjamin wrote about the life of Persian Jews, describing conditions and beliefs that went back to the 16th century: \"…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt….\"\n\nIn Jerusalem at least, conditions for some Jews improved. Moses Montefiore, on his seventh visit in 1875, noted that fine new buildings had sprung up and; 'surely we're approaching the time to witness God's hallowed promise unto Zion.' Muslim and Christian Arabs participated in Purim and Passover; Arabs called the Sephardis 'Jews, sons of Arabs'; the Ulema and the Rabbis offered joint prayers for rain in time of drought.\n\nAt the time of the Dreyfus trial in France, 'Muslim comments usually favoured the persecuted Jew against his Christian persecutors'.\n\nIn 1850 the German composer Richard Wagner – who has been called \"the inventor of modern antisemitism\" – published \"Das Judenthum in der Musik\" (roughly \"Jewishness in Music\") under a pseudonym in the \"Neue Zeitschrift für Musik\". The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer, but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in German culture, who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly \"German\" art. The crux was the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:\n\nAccording to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.\n\nAlthough originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.\nAntisemitism can also be found in many of the Grimms' Fairy Tales by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the villain of a story, such as in \"The Good Bargain\" (\"Der gute Handel\") and \"The Jew Among Thorns\" (\"Der Jude im Dorn\").\n\nThe middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress, but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.\n\nIn America, even such influential figures as Walt Whitman tolerated bigotry toward the Jews. During his time as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle (1846–1848), the newspaper published historical sketches casting Jews in a bad light.\n\nThe Dreyfus Affair was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish artillery captain in the French Army, was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil's Island. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. Émile Zola accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.\n\nAdolf Stoecker (1835–1909), the Lutheran court chaplain to Kaiser Wilhelm I, founded in 1878 an antisemitic, anti-liberal political party called the Christian Social Party. This party always remained small, and its support dwindled after Stoecker's death, with most of its members eventually joining larger conservative groups such as the German National People's Party.\n\nSome scholars view Karl Marx's essay \"On The Jewish Question\" as antisemitic, and argue that he often used antisemitic epithets in his published and private writings. These scholars argue that Marx equated Judaism with capitalism in his essay, helping to spread that idea. Some further argue that the essay influenced National Socialist, as well as Soviet and Arab antisemites. Marx himself had Jewish ancestry, and Albert Lindemann and Hyam Maccoby have suggested that he was embarrassed by it. Others argue that Marx consistently supported Prussian Jewish communities' struggles to achieve equal political rights. These scholars argue that \"On the Jewish Question\" is a critique of Bruno Bauer's arguments that Jews must convert to Christianity before being emancipated, and is more generally a critique of liberal rights discourses and capitalism. Iain Hamphsher-Monk wrote that \"This work [On The Jewish Question] has been cited as evidence for Marx's supposed anti-semitism, but only the most superficial reading of it could sustain such an interpretation.\" David McLellan and Francis Wheen argue that readers should interpret \"On the Jewish Question\" in the deeper context of Marx's debates with Bruno Bauer, author of \"The Jewish Question\", about Jewish emancipation in Germany. Wheen says that \"Those critics, who see this as a foretaste of 'Mein Kampf', overlook one, essential point: in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews. It was a retort to Bruno Bauer, who had argued that Jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as Christians\". According to McLellan, Marx used the word \"Judentum\" colloquially, as meaning \"commerce\", arguing that Germans must be emancipated from the capitalist mode of production not Judaism or Jews in particular. McLellan concludes that readers should interpret the essay's second half as \"an extended pun at Bauer's expense\".\n\nBetween 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75 million Jews migrated to America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the upward social mobility of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In the first half of the 20th century, in the US, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of Leo Frank by a mob of prominent citizens in Marietta, Georgia in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States. The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the Ku Klux Klan which had been inactive since 1870.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Beilis Trial in Russia represented incidents of blood-libel in Europe. Christians used allegations of Jews killing Christians as a justification for the killing of Jews.\nAntisemitism in America reached its peak during the interwar period. The pioneer automobile manufacturer Henry Ford propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper \"The Dearborn Independent\" (published by Ford from 1919 to 1927). The radio speeches of Father Coughlin in the late 1930s attacked Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy. Some prominent politicians shared such views: Louis T. McFadden, Chairman of the United States House Committee on Banking and Currency, blamed Jews for Roosevelt's decision to abandon the gold standard, and claimed that \"in the United States today, the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money\".\n\nIn the early 1940s the aviator Charles Lindbergh and many prominent Americans led The America First Committee in opposing any involvement in the war against Fascism. During his July 1936 visit to Nazi Germany, a few weeks before the 1936 Summer Olympics, Lindbergh wrote letters saying that there was \"more intelligent leadership in Germany than is generally recognized\". The German American Bund held parades in New York City during the late 1930s, where members wore Nazi uniforms and raised flags featuring swastikas alongside American flags.\n\nSometimes race riots, as in Detroit in 1943, targeted Jewish businesses for looting and burning.\n\nIn Germany, Nazism led Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, who came to power on 30 January 1933 shortly afterwards instituted repressive legislation which denied the Jews basic civil rights. \nIn September 1935, the Nuremberg Laws prohibited sexual relations and marriages between \"Aryans\" and Jews as \"Rassenschande\" (\"race disgrace\") and stripped all German Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews, of their citizenship, (their official title became \"subjects of the state\"). It instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed \"Kristallnacht\", in which Jews were killed, their property destroyed and their synagogues torched. Antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were extended to German-occupied Europe in the wake of conquest, often building on local antisemitic traditions. \nIn the east the Third Reich forced Jews into ghettos in Warsaw, in Kraków, in Lvov, in Lublin and in Radom. \nAfter the beginning of the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1941 a campaign of mass murder, conducted by the Einsatzgruppen, culminated from 1942 to 1945 in systematic genocide: the Holocaust. Eleven million Jews were targeted for extermination by the Nazis, and some six million were eventually killed.\n\nAntisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for settling personal conflicts in the Soviet Union, starting with the conflict between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky and continuing through numerous conspiracy-theories spread by official propaganda. Antisemitism in the USSR reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the \"rootless cosmopolitan\" (euphemism for \"Jew\") in which numerous Yiddish-language poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested. This culminated in the so-called Doctors' Plot (1952–1953). Similar antisemitic propaganda in Poland resulted in the flight of Polish Jewish survivors from the country.\n\nAfter the war, the Kielce pogrom and the \"March 1968 events\" in communist Poland represented further incidents of antisemitism in Europe. The anti-Jewish violence in postwar Poland has a common theme of blood libel rumours.\n\nPhysical assaults against Jews in those countries included beatings, stabbings and other violence, which increased markedly, sometimes resulting in serious injury and death. A 2015 report by the US State Department on religious freedom declared that \"European anti-Israel sentiment crossed the line into anti-Semitism.\"\n\nThis rise in antisemitic attacks is associated with both the Muslim anti-Semitism and the rise of far-right political parties as a result of the economic crisis of 2008. This rise in the support for far right ideas in western and eastern Europe has resulted in the increase of antisemitic acts, mostly attacks on Jewish memorials, synagogues and cemeteries but also a number of physical attacks against Jews.\n\nIn Eastern Europe the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the instability of the new states has brought the rise of nationalist movements and the accusation against Jews for the economic crisis, taking over the local economy and bribing the government alongside with traditional and religious motives for antisemitism such as blood libels. Most of the antisemitic incidents are against Jewish cemeteries and building (community centers and synagogues). Nevertheless, there were several violent attacks against Jews in Moscow in 2006 when a neo-Nazi stabbed 9 people at the Bolshaya Bronnaya Synagogue, the failed bomb attack on the same synagogue in 1999, the threats against Jewish pilgrims in Uman, Ukraine and the attack against a menorah by extremist Christian organization in Moldova in 2009.\n\nEuropeans are concerned about antisemitism because, historically, societies with a large degree of anti-Semitism are self-destructive. Furthermore, the Jews of Europe have generally aligned themselves with Europe's democratic elite, a class whose future is uncertain according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nRobert Bernstein, founder of Human Rights Watch, says that antisemitism is \"deeply ingrained and institutionalized\" in \"Arab nations in modern times.\"\n\nIn a 2011 survey by the Pew Research Center, all of the Muslim-majority Middle Eastern countries polled held few positive opinions of Jews. In the questionnaire, only 2% of Egyptians, 3% of Lebanese Muslims, and 2% of Jordanians reported having a positive view of Jews. Muslim-majority countries outside the Middle East similarly had few who held positive views of Jews, with 4% of Turks and 9% of Indonesians viewing Jews favorably.\n\nAccording to a 2011 exhibition at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, United States, some of the dialogue from Middle East media and commentators about Jews bear a striking resemblance to Nazi propaganda. According to Josef Joffe of \"Newsweek\", \"anti-Semitism—the real stuff, not just bad-mouthing particular Israeli policies—is as much part of Arab life today as the hijab or the hookah. Whereas this darkest of creeds is no longer tolerated in polite society in the West, in the Arab world, Jew hatred remains culturally endemic.\"\n\nMuslim clerics in the Middle East have frequently referred to Jews as descendants of apes and pigs, which are conventional epithets for Jews and Christians.\n\nAccording to professor Robert Wistrich, director of the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism (SICSA), the calls for the destruction of Israel by Iran or by Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, or the Muslim Brotherhood, represent a contemporary mode of genocidal antisemitism.\n\nAntisemitism has been explained in terms of racism, xenophobia, projected guilt, displaced aggression, and the search for a scapegoat. Some explanations assign partial blame to the perception of Jewish people as unsociable. Such a perception may have arisen by many Jews having strictly kept to their own communities, with their own practices and laws.\n\nIt has also been suggested that parts of antisemitism arose from a perception of Jewish people as greedy (as often used in stereotypes of Jews), and this perception has probably evolved in Europe during Medieval times where a large portion of money lending was operated by Jews. Factors contributing to this situation included that Jews were restricted from other professions, while the Christian Church declared for their followers that money lending constituted immoral \"usury\".\n\nA March 2008 report by the U.S. State Department found that there was an increase in antisemitism across the world, and that both old and new expressions of antisemitism persist. A 2012 report by the U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor also noted a continued global increase in antisemitism, and found that Holocaust denial and opposition to Israeli policy at times was used to promote or justify blatant antisemitism. In 2014, the ADL conducted a study titled \"Global 100: An Index of Anti-Semitism\", which also reported high antisemitism figures around the world and, among other findings, that as many as \"27% of people who have never met a Jew nevertheless harbor strong prejudices against him\".\n\nAlmost all Jews in Algeria left upon independence in 1962. Algeria's 140,000 Jews had French citizenship since 1870 (briefly revoked by Vichy France in 1940), and they mainly went to France, with some going to Israel.\n\nIn Egypt, Dar al-Fadhilah published a translation of Henry Ford's antisemitic treatise, \"The International Jew\", complete with distinctly antisemitic imagery on the cover.\n\nOn 5 May 2001, after Shimon Peres visited Egypt, the Egyptian \"al-Akhbar\" internet paper said that \"lies and deceit are not foreign to Jews[...]. For this reason, Allah changed their shape and made them into monkeys and pigs.\"\n\nIn July 2012, Egypt's Al Nahar channel fooled actors into thinking they were on an Israeli television show and filmed their reactions to being told it was an Israeli television show. In response, some of the actors launched into antisemitic rants or dialogue, and many became violent. Actress Mayer El Beblawi said that \"Allah did not curse the worm and moth as much as he cursed the Jews\" while actor Mahmoud Abdel Ghaffar launched into a violent rage and said, \"You brought me someone who looks like a Jew... I hate the Jews to death\" after finding out it was a prank.\n\nLibya had once one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to 300 BCE. Despite the repression of Jews in the late 1930, as a result of the pro-Nazi Fascist Italian regime, Jews were third of the population of Libya till 1941. In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in Tripoli and most synagogues in the city looted.\nUpon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the Suez Crisis in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When Muammar al-Gaddafi came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews cancelled.\n\nJewish communities, in Islamic times often living in ghettos known as \"mellah\", have existed in Morocco for at least 2,000 years. Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of 6,000 Jews in Fez in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and Marrakesh in 1146 and again in Marrakesh in 1232) were accompanied by systematic discrimination through the years.\nIn 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in Demnat, Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight.\nWhile the pro-Nazi Vichy regime during World War II passed discriminatory laws against Jews, King Muhammad prevented deportation of Jews to death camps (although Jews with French, as opposed to Moroccan, citizenship, being directly subject to Vichy law, were still deported.)\nIn 1948, approximately 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.\nIn June 1948, soon after Israel was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in Oujda and Djerada, killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early fifties, Zionist organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:\nIn 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed. By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.\nThe Six-Day War in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco. By 1971, the Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this wave of emigration went to Europe and North America rather than Israel.\n\nAntisemitism has been present in history of South Africa since Europeans first set foot ashore on the Cape Peninsula. In the years 1652–1795 Jews were not allowed to settle at the Cape. An 1868 Act would sanction religious discrimination. Antisemitism reached its apotheosis in the years leading up to World War II. Inspired by the rise of national socialism in Germany the Ossewabrandwag (OB) – whose membership accounted for almost 25% of the 1940 Afrikaner population – and the National Party faction \"New Order\" would champion a more programmatic solution to the 'Jewish problem'.\n\nJews have lived in Tunisia for at least 2,300 years. In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in Kairouan and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as \"hara\". Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, Muhammad Bey relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.\nTunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct Nazi control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.\nIn 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in Tunisia. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and France accelerated. There were also attacks in 1982, 1985, and most recently in 2002 when a suicide bombing in Djerba took 21 lives (most of them German tourists) near the local synagogue, in a terrorist attack claimed by Al-Qaeda. \n\nIn modern-day Tunisia, there have been many instances of antisemitic acts and statements. Since the government is not quick to condemn them, antisemitism spreads throughout Tunisian society. Following the Ben Ali regime, there have been an increasing number of public offenses against Jews in Tunisia. For example, in February 2012, when Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghanaim entered Tunisia, he was welcomed by Islamists who chanted \"Death to the Jews\" as a sign of their support. The following month, during protests in Tunis, a Salafi sheikh told young Tunisians to gather and learn to kill Jews.\n\nIn the past, The Tunisian government has made efforts to block Jews from entering high positions, and some moderate members have tried to cover up the more extremist anti-Semitic efforts by appointing Jews to governmental positions, however, it is known that Muslim clerics believe that if the Muslim Brotherhood leads the regime, that will enhance their hatred towards Jews. In response to the prevalent anti-Semitism, the Tunisian government has publicly protected the dwindling population and its marks of Jewish culture, for example, synagogues, and advised them to settle in Djerba, a French tourist attraction. \n\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad, former president of Iran, has frequently been accused of denying the Holocaust.\n\nIn July, the winner of Iran's first annual International Wall Street Downfall Cartoon Festival, jointly sponsored by the semi-state-run Iranian media outlet Fars News, was an antisemitic cartoon depicting Jews praying before the New York Stock Exchange, which is made to look like the Western Wall. Other cartoons in the contest were antisemitic as well. The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, condemned the cartoon, stating that \"Here's the anti-Semitic notion of Jews and their love for money, the canard that Jews 'control' Wall Street, and a cynical perversion of the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism,\" and \"Once again Iran takes the prize for promoting antisemitism.\"\n\nThe Japanese first learned about antisemitism in 1918, during the cooperation of the Imperial Japanese Army with the White movement in Siberia. White Army soldiers had been issued copies of \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", and \"The \"Protocols\" continue to be used as evidence of Jewish conspiracies even though they are widely acknowledged to be a forgery. During World War II, Nazi Germany encouraged Japan to adopt antisemitic policies. In the post-war period, extremist groups and ideologues have promoted conspiracy theories.\n\nIn 2004, Al-Manar, a media network affiliated with Hezbollah, aired a drama series, \"The Diaspora\", which observers allege is based on historical antisemitic allegations. BBC correspondents who have watched the program says it quotes extensively from the \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\".\n\nAlthough Malaysia presently has no substantial Jewish population, the country has reportedly become an example of a phenomenon called \"antisemitism without Jews.\"\n\nIn his treatise on Malay identity, \"The Malay Dilemma,\" which was published in 1970, former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad wrote: \"The Jews are not only hooked-nosed... but understand money instinctively... Jewish stinginess and financial wizardry gained them the economic control of Europe and provoked antisemitism which waxed and waned throughout Europe through the ages.\"\n\nThe Malay-language Utusan Malaysia daily stated in an editorial that Malaysians \"cannot allow anyone, especially the Jews, to interfere secretly in this country's business... When the drums are pounded hard in the name of human rights, the pro-Jewish people will have their best opportunity to interfere in any Islamic country,\" the newspaper said. \"We might not realize that the enthusiasm to support actions such as demonstrations will cause us to help foreign groups succeed in their mission of controlling this country.\" Prime Minister Najib Razak's office subsequently issued a statement late Monday saying Utusan's claim did \"not reflect the views of the government.\"\n\nIn March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that \"Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books,\" to the extent that they are \"an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA.\" In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is \"going on all the time\" and that it is \"worrying and disturbing.\" At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: \"that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews.\" In August 2014, the Hamas' spokesman in Doha said on live television that Jews use blood to make matzos.\n\nThe U.S. State Department's first Report on Global Anti-Semitism mentioned a strong feeling of antisemitism in Pakistan. In Pakistan, a country without Jewish communities, antisemitic sentiment fanned by antisemitic articles in the press is widespread.\n\nIn Pakistan, Jews are often regarded as miserly. After Israel's independence in 1948, violent incidents occurred against Pakistan's small Jewish community of about 2,000 Bene Israel Jews. The Magain Shalome Synagogue in Karachi was attacked, as were individual Jews. The persecution of Jews resulted in their exodus via India to Israel (see Pakistanis in Israel), the UK, Canada and other countries. The Peshawar Jewish community ceased to exist although a small community reportedly still exists in Karachi.\n\nA substantial number of people in Pakistan believe that the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York were a secret Jewish conspiracy organized by Israel's MOSSAD, as were the 7 July 2005 London bombings, allegedly perpetrated by Jews in order to discredit Muslims. Pakistani political commentator Zaid Hamid claimed that Indian Jews perpetrated the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Such allegations echo traditional antisemitic theories.\nThe Jewish religious movement of Chabad Lubavich had a mission house in Mumbai, India that was attacked in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, perpetrated by militants connected to Pakistan led by Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani national. Antisemitic intents were evident from the testimonies of Kasab following his arrest and trial.\n\nSaudi textbooks vilify Jews, call Jews apes; demand that students avoid and not befriend Jews; claim that Jews worship the devil; and encourage Muslims to engage in Jihad to vanquish Jews.\nSaudi Arabian government officials and state religious leaders often promote the idea that Jews are conspiring to take over the entire world; as proof of their claims they publish and frequently cite \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" as factual.\n\nIn 2004, the official Saudi Arabia tourism website said that Jews and holders of Israeli passports would not be issued visas to enter the country. After an uproar, the restriction against Jews was removed from the website although the ban against Israeli passport-holders remained. In late 2014, a Saudi newspaper reported that foreign workers of most religions, including Judaism, were welcome in the kingdom, but Israeli citizens were not.\n\nIn 2003, the Neve Shalom Synagogue was targeted in a car bombing, killing 21 Turkish Muslims and 6 Jews.\n\nIn June 2011, the \"Economist\" suggested that \"The best way for Turks to promote democracy would be to vote against the ruling party\". Not long after, the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said that \"The International media, as they are supported by Israel, would not be happy with the continuation of the AKP government\". The \"Hurriyet Daily News\" quoted Erdoğan at the time as claiming \"The Economist is part of an Israeli conspiracy that aims to topple the Turkish government\".\nMoreover, during Erdogan's tenure, Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\" has once again become a best selling book in Turkey. Prime Minister Erdogan called antisemitism a \"crime against humanity.\" He also said that \"as a minority, they're our citizens. Both their security and the right to observe their faith are under our guarantee.\"\n\nAccording to a 2004 report from the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, antisemitism had increased significantly in Europe since 2000, with significant increases in verbal attacks against Jews and vandalism such as graffiti, fire bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and cemeteries. Germany, France, Britain, and Russia are the countries with the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe. The Netherlands and Sweden have also consistently had high rates of antisemitic attacks since 2000.\n\nSome claim that recent European antisemitic violence can actually be seen as a spillover from the long running Arab-Israeli conflict since the majority of the perpetrators are from the large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities. However, compared to France, the United Kingdom and much of the rest of Europe, in Germany Arab and pro-Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents. According to \"The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism\", most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside.\n\nOn 1 January 2006, Britain's chief rabbi, Lord Jonathan Sacks, warned that what he called a \"tsunami of antisemitism\" was spreading globally. In an interview with BBC Radio 4, Sacks said: \"A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets. We've had synagogues desecrated. We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground—not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of feeling that you don't know what's going to happen next that's making... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable.\"\n\nFollowing an escalation in antisemitism in 2012, which included the deadly shooting of three children at a Jewish school in France, the European Jewish Congress demanded in July a more proactive response. EJC President Moshe Kantor explained, \"We call on authorities to take a more proactive approach so there would be no reason for statements of regret and denunciation. All these smaller attacks remind me of smaller tremors before a massive earthquake. The Jewish community cannot afford to be subject to an earthquake and the authorities cannot say that the writing was not on the wall.\" He added that European countries should take legislative efforts to ban any form of incitement, as well as to equip the authorities with the necessary tools to confront any attempt to expand terrorist and violent activities against Jewish communities in Europe.\n\nFrance is home to the continent's largest Jewish community (about 600,000). Jewish leaders decry an intensifying antisemitism in France, mainly among Muslims of Arab or African heritage, but also growing among Caribbean islanders from former French colonies. Former Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy denounced the killing of Ilan Halimi on 13 February 2006 as an antisemitic crime.\n\nJewish philanthropist Baron Eric de Rothschild suggests that the extent of antisemitism in France has been exaggerated. In an interview with \"The Jerusalem Post\" he says that \"the one thing you can't say is that France is an anti-Semitic country.\"\nIn March 2012, Mohammed Merah opened fire at a Jewish school in Toulouse, killing a teacher and three children. An 8-year-old girl was shot in the head at point blank range. President Nicolas Sarkozy said that it was \"obvious\" it was an antisemitic attack and that, \"I want to say to all the leaders of the Jewish community, how close we feel to them. All of France is by their side.\" The Israeli Prime Minister condemned the \"despicable anti-Semitic\" murders. After a 32-hour siege and standoff with the police outside his house, and a French raid, Merah jumped off a balcony and was shot in the head and killed. Merah told police during the standoff that he intended to keep on attacking, and he loved death the way the police loved life. He also claimed connections with al-Qaeda.\n\n4 months later, in July 2012, a French Jewish teenager wearing a \"distinctive religious symbol\" was the victim of a violent antisemitic attack on a train travelling between Toulouse and Lyon. The teen was first verbally harassed and later beaten up by two assailants. Richard Prasquier from the French Jewish umbrella group, CRIF, called the attack \"another development in the worrying trend of anti-Semitism in our country.\"\n\nAnother incident in July 2012 dealt with the vandalism of the synagogue of Noisy-le-Grand of the Seine-Saint-Denis district in Paris. The synagogue was vandalized three times in a ten-day period. Prayer books and shawls were thrown on the floor, windows were shattered, drawers were ransacked, and walls, tables, clocks, and floors were vandalized. The authorities were alerted of the incidents by the Bureau National de Vigilance Contre L'Antisémtisme (BNVCA), a French antisemitism watchdog group, which called for more measures to be taken to prevent future hate crimes. BNVCA President Sammy Ghozlan stated that, \"Despite the measures taken, things persist, and I think that we need additional legislation, because the Jewish community is annoyed.\"\n\nIn August 2012, Abraham Cooper, the dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, met French Interior Minister Manuel Valls and reported that antisemitic attacks against French Jews increased by 40% since Merah's shooting spree in Toulouse. Cooper pressed Valls to take extra measures to secure the safety of French Jews, as well as to discuss strategies to foil an increasing trend of lone-wolf terrorists on the Internet.\n\nWolfgang Schäuble, the Interior Minister of Germany in 2006, pointed out the official policy of Germany: \"We will not tolerate any form of extremism, xenophobia or anti-Semitism.\" Although the number of extreme right-wing groups and organisations grew from 141 (2001) to 182 (2006), especially in the formerly communist East Germany, Germany's measures against right-wing groups and antisemitism are effective, despite Germany having the highest rates of antisemitic acts in Europe. According to the annual reports of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution the overall number of far-right extremists in Germany dropped during the last years from 49,700 (2001), 45,000 (2002), 41,500 (2003), 40,700 (2004), 39,000 (2005), to 38,600 in 2006. Germany provided several million euros to fund \"nationwide programs aimed at fighting far-right extremism, including teams of traveling consultants, and victims' groups.\"\n\nIn July 2012, two women were assaulted in Germany, sprayed with tear gas, and were shown a \"Hitler salute,\" apparently because of a Star of David necklace that they wore.\n\nIn late August 2012, Berlin police investigated an attack on a 53-year-old rabbi and his 6-year-old daughter, allegedly by four Arab teens, after which the rabbi needed treatment for head wounds at a hospital. The police classified the attack as a hate crime. \"Jüdische Allgemeine\" reported that the rabbi was wearing a kippah and was approached by one of the teens, who asked the rabbi if he was Jewish. The teen then attacked the rabbi while yelling antisemitic comments, and threatened to kill the rabbi's daughter. Berlin's mayor condemned the attack, saying that \"Berlin is an international city in which intolerance, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are not being tolerated. Police will undertake all efforts to find and arrest the perpetrators.\"\n\nIn October 2012, various historians, including Dr. Julius H. Schoeps, a prominent German-Jewish historian and a member of the German Interior Ministry's commission to combat antisemitism, charged the majority of Bundestag deputies with failing to understand antisemitism and the imperativeness of periodic legislative reports on German antisemitism. Schoeps cited various antisemitic statements by German parliament members as well. The report in question determined that 15% of Germans are antisemitic while over 20% espouse \"latent anti-Semitism,\" but the report has been criticized for downplaying the sharpness of antisemitism in Germany, as well as for failing to examine anti-Israel media coverage in Germany.\n\nAntisemitism in Greece manifests itself in religious, political and media discourse. The recent Greek government-debt crisis has facilitated the rise of far right groups in Greece, most notably the formerly obscure Golden Dawn.\nJews have lived in Greece since antiquity, but the largest community of around 20,000 Sephardic Jews settled in Thessalonica after an invitation from the Ottoman Sultan in the 15th century. After Thessalonica was annexed to Greece in 1913, the Greek government recognized Jews as Greek citizens with full rights and attributed Judaism the status of a recognized and protected religion. Currently in Greece, Jewish communities representing the 5,000 Greek Jews are legal entities under public law. \nAccording to the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) report of 2015, the \"ADL Global 100\", a report of the status of antisemitism in 100 countries around the world, 69% of the adult population in Greece harbor antisemitic attitudes and 85% think that \"Jews have too much power in the business world\".\nIn March 2015, a survey about the Greeks' perceptions of the holocaust was published. Its findings showed that less than 60 percent of the respondents think that holocaust teaching should be included in the curriculum.\n\nIn the 21st century, antisemitism in Hungary has evolved and received an institutional framework, while verbal and physical aggression against Jews has escalated, creating a great difference between its earlier manifestations in the 1990s and recent developments. One of the major representatives of this institutionalized antisemitic ideology is the popular Hungarian party Jobbik, which received 17 percent of the vote in the April 2010 national election. The far-right subculture, which ranges from nationalist shops to radical-nationalist and neo-Nazi festivals and events, plays a major role in the institutionalization of Hungarian antisemitism in the 21st century. The contemporary antisemitic rhetoric has been updated and expanded, but is still based on the old antisemitic notions. The traditional accusations and motifs include such phrases as Jewish occupation, international Jewish conspiracy, Jewish responsibility for the Treaty of Trianon, Judeo-Bolshevism, as well as blood libels against Jews. Nevertheless, the past few years have seen the reemergence of the blood libel and an increase in Holocaust relativization and denial, while the monetary crisis has revived references to the \"Jewish banker class\".\n\nThe ongoing political conflict between Israel and Palestine has played an important role in the development and expression of antisemitism in the 21st century, and in Italy as well. The Second Intifada, which began in late September 2000, has set in motion unexpected mechanisms, whereby traditional anti-Jewish prejudices were mixed with politically based stereotypes. In this belief system, Israeli Jews were charged with full responsibility for the fate of the peace process and with the conflict presented as embodying the struggle between good (the Palestinians) and evil (the Israeli Jews).\n\nThe Netherlands has the second highest incidence of antisemitic incidents in the European Union. However, it is difficult to obtain exact figures because the specific groups against whom attacks are made are not specifically identified in police reports, and analyses of police data for antisemitism therefore relies on key-word searches, e.g. \"Jew\" or \"Israel\". According to Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel (CIDI), a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands, the number of antisemitic incidents reported in the whole of the Netherlands was 108 in 2008, 93 in 2009, and 124 in 2010. Some two thirds of this are acts of aggression. There are approximately 52 000 Dutch Jews. According to the NRC Handelsblad newspaper, the number of antisemitic incidents in Amsterdam was 14 in 2008 and 30 in 2009. In 2010, Raphaël Evers, an orthodox rabbi in Amsterdam, told the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten that Jews can no longer be safe in the city anymore due to the risk of violent assaults. \"We Jews no longer feel at home here in the Netherlands. Many people talk about moving to Israel,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Anne Frank Foundation, antisemitism in the Netherlands in 2011 was roughly at the same level as in 2010. Actual antisemitic incidents increased from 19 in 2010 to 30 in 2011. Verbal antisemitic incidents dropped slightly from 1173 in 2010 to 1098 in 2011. This accounts for 75%–80% of all verbal racist incidents in the Netherlands. Antisemitism is more prevalent in the age group 23–27 years, which is a younger group than that of racist incidents in general.\n\nIn 2010, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among some 8th, 9th, and 10th graders in Oslo's schools. Teachers at schools with large numbers of Muslims revealed that Muslim students often \"praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of Jews\", that \"Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students\" and that \"Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the Holocaust\". Additionally, \"while some students might protest when some express support for terrorism, none object when students express hate of Jews\", saying that it says in \"the Quran that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews\". Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One Jewish father also stated that his child had been taken by a Muslim mob after school (though the child managed to escape), reportedly \"to be taken out to the forest and hung because he was a Jew\".\n\nNorwegian Education Minister Kristin Halvorsen referred to the antisemitism reported in this study as being \"completely unacceptable.\" The head of a local Islamic council joined Jewish leaders and Halvorsen in denouncing such antisemitism.\n\nIn October 2012, the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe issued a report regarding antisemitism in Norway, criticizing Norway for an increase in antisemitism in the country and blaming Norwegian officials for failing to address antisemitism.\"\n\nThe University of Warsaw’s study in 2016 found that 37% of surveyed Poles expressed negative attitudes towards Jews (up from 32% in 2015); 56% said that they wouldn't accept a Jew in their family (up from 46%); and 32% wouldn't want Jewish neighbors (up from 27%).\n\nIn November 2015, following Antoni Macierewicz’s (Law and Justice party) designation as Minister of National Defence, he faced allegations of antisemitism and protests by the Anti Defamation League.\n\nIn February 2018, the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that \"there were Jewish perpetrators\" of the Holocaust, \"not only German perpetrators.\" Ronald Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, condemned Morawiecki's words: \"This is nothing short of an attempt to falsify history, that is one of the very worst forms of anti-Semitism and Holocaust obfuscation.\" Israeli politician Yair Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid party, said Morawiecki's remark is \"anti-Semitism of the oldest kind.\"\n\nSince the early 2000s, levels of antisemitism in Russia have been low, and steadily decreasing. President of the Russian Jewish Congress attributes this in part to the vanished state sponsorship of antisemitism. At the same time experts warn that worsening economic conditions may lead to the surge of xenophobia and antisemitism in particular.\n\nStill, since the mid-2000s incorporation of antisemitic discourse into the platforms and speeches of nationalist political movements in Russia has been reported by human rights monitors in Russia as well as in the press. A number of prominent modern Russian politicians are known for their antisemitic views.\n\nAfter Germany and Austria, Sweden has the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe, though the Netherlands has reported a higher rate of antisemitism in some years. A government study in 2006 estimated that 15% of Swedes agree with the statement: \"The Jews have too much influence in the world today\". 5% of the total adult population and 39% of adult Muslims \"harbour systematic antisemitic views\". The former prime minister Göran Persson described these results as \"surprising and terrifying\". However, the rabbi of Stockholm's Orthodox Jewish community, Meir Horden, said that \"It's not true to say that the Swedes are anti-Semitic. Some of them are hostile to Israel because they support the weak side, which they perceive the Palestinians to be.\"\n\nIn 2009, a synagogue that served the Jewish community in Malmö was set ablaze. Jewish cemeteries were repeatedly desecrated, worshippers were abused while returning home from prayer, and masked men mockingly chanted \"Hitler\" in the streets. As a result of security concerns, Malmö's synagogue has guards and rocket-proof glass in the windows, and the Jewish kindergarten can only be reached through thick steel security doors.\n\nIn early 2010, the Swedish publication \"The Local\" published series of articles about the growing antisemitism in Malmö, Sweden. In 2009, the Malmö police received reports of 79 antisemitic incidents, which was twice the number of the previous year (2008). Fredrik Sieradzki, spokesman for the Malmö Jewish community, estimated that the already small Jewish population is shrinking by 5% a year. \"Malmö is a place to move away from,\" he said, citing antisemitism as the primary reason. In March 2010, Fredrik Sieradzk told \"Die Presse\", an Austrian Internet publication, that Jews are being \"harassed and physically attacked\" by \"people from the Middle East,\" although he added that only a small number of Malmö's 40,000 Muslims \"exhibit hatred of Jews.\" In October 2010, \"The Forward\" reported on the current state of Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and professor of history at the University of Lund, claimed that members of the Swedish Parliament have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. Judith Popinski, an 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, stated that she is no longer invited to schools that have a large Muslim presence to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust. In December 2010, the Jewish human rights organization Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory concerning Sweden, advising Jews to express \"extreme caution\" when visiting the southern parts of the country due to an alleged increase in verbal and physical harassment of Jewish citizens in the city of Malmö. Ilmar Reepalu, the mayor of Malmö for over 15 years, has been accused of failing to protect the Jewish community in Malmö, causing 30 Jewish families to leave the city in 2010, and more preparing to leave, which has left the possibility that Malmö's Jewish community will disappear soon. Critics of Reepalu say that his statements, such as antisemitism in Malmö actually being an \"understandable\" consequence of Israeli policy in the Middle East, have encouraged young Muslims to abuse and harass the Jewish community. In an interview with \"the Sunday Telegraph\" in February 2010, Reepalu said, \"There haven't been any attacks on Jewish people, and if Jews from the city want to move to Israel that is not a matter for Malmö,\" which renewed concerns about Reepalu.\n\nOleh Tyahnybok, the leader of the far-right Svoboda party, whose members hold senior positions in Ukraine's government, urged his party to fight \"the Moscow-Jewish mafia ruling Ukraine.\" The \"Algemeiner Journal\" reported: \"Svoboda supporters include among their heroes leaders of pro-Nazi World War II organizations known for their atrocities against Jews and Poles, such as the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), and the 14th Waffen-SS Galicia Division.\"\n\nAccording to The Simon Wiesenthal Center (in January 2011) \"Ukraine has, to the best of our knowledge, never conducted a single investigation of a local Nazi war criminal, let alone prosecuted a Holocaust perpetrator.\"\n\nAccording to \"Der Spiegel\", Dmytro Yarosh, leader of the far-right Right Sector, wrote: \"I wonder how it came to pass that most of the billionaires in Ukraine are Jews?\" Late February 2014 Yarosh pledged during a meeting with Israel’s ambassador in Kiev to fight all forms of racism. Right Sector's leader for West Ukraine, Oleksandr Muzychko, has talked about fighting \"communists, Jews and Russians for as long as blood flows in my veins.\" Muzychko was shot dead on 24 March 2014. An official inquiry concluded he had shot himself in the heart at the end of a chase with the Ukrainian police.\n\nIn April 2014, Donetsk Chief Rabbi Pinchas Vishedski said that \"Anti-Semitic incidents in the Russian-speaking east were rare, unlike in Kiev and western Ukraine.\" In an April 2014 article about anti-Jewish violence in Ukraine in \"Haaretz\" no incidents outside this \"Russian-speaking east\" were mentioned.\n\nAccording to the Israel's Ambassador to Ukraine, the antisemitism occurs here much less frequently than in other European countries, and has more a hooligan's nature rather than a system.\n\nIn 2017 an Institute for Jewish Policy Research survey found that the levels of anti-Semitism in Great Britain were among the lowest in the world, with 2.4% expressing multiple anti-Semitic attitudes, and about 70% having a favourable opinion of Jews. However, only 17% had a favourable opinion of Israel, with 33% holding an unfavourable view.\n\nIn 2017, a report by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) found that the previous year, 2016, had been the worst on record for antisemitic hate crime in the UK. Prior to that, 2015 had been the worst year on record, and 2014 was the worst year on record before that. The report found that in 2016, antisemitic crime rose by 15% compared to 2015, or 45% compared to 2014. It also found that 1 in 10 antisemitic crimes was violent. Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the charging of antisemitic crime. In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: \"Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews are failing to enforce the law. There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change.\"\n\nEvery year since 2015, the CAA has commissioned polling by YouGov concerning the attitude of the British public toward British Jews. In 2017, their polling found that 36% of British adults believed at least one of the antisemitic statements pollsters had shown them to be true, a reduction from 39% in 2016 and 45% in 2015. Additionally, the polling revealed widespread fear amongst British Jews, with almost 1 in 3 saying that they had considered emigrating in the last two years due to antisemitism, and 37% saying that they concealed their Judaism in public. The report gave various indications as to the cause of the fears, with British Jews identifying Islamist antisemitism, far-left antisemitism and far-right antisemitism as their main concerns, in that order. 78% of British Jews saying that they had witnessed antisemitism disguised as a political comment about Israel, 76% thoughts that political developments were contributing antisemitism, and 52% felt that the Crown Prosecution Service was not doing enough.\n\nIn 2016, the Home Affairs Select Committee held an inquiry into the rise of antisemitism in the UK. The inquiry called David Cameron, Tim Farron, Angus Robertson, Jeremy Corbyn, Ken Livingstone and others to give evidence. In 2005, a group of British Members of Parliament set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006. Its report stated that \"until recently, the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond [had been] that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society.\" It found a reversal of this progress since 2000. The inquiry was reconstituted following a surge in antisemitic incidents in Britain during the summer of 2014, and the new inquiry published its report in 2015, making recommendations for reducing antisemitism.\n\nAlthough antisemitism in Canada is less prevalent than in many other countries, there have been recent incidents. For example, a 2004 study identified 24 incidents of antisemitism between 14 March and 14 July 2004 in Newfoundland, Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and some smaller Ontario communities. The incidents included vandalism and other attacks on four synagogues, six cemeteries, four schools, and a number of businesses and private residences.\n\nIn November 2005, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights examined antisemitism on college campuses. It reported that \"incidents of threatened bodily injury, physical intimidation or property damage are now rare\", but antisemitism still occurs on many campuses and is a \"serious problem.\" The Commission recommended that the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights protect college students from antisemitism through vigorous enforcement of \"Title VI\" of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and further recommended that Congress clarify that Title VI applies to discrimination against Jewish students.\n\nOn 19 September 2006, Yale University founded the Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism (YIISA), the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, as part of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Director Charles Small of the Center cited the increase in antisemitism worldwide in recent years as generating a \"need to understand the current manifestation of this disease\". In June 2011, Yale voted to close this initiative. After carrying out a routine review, the faculty review committee said that the initiative had not met its research and teaching standards. Donald Green, then head of Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies, the body under whose aegis the antisemitism initiative was run, said that it had not had many papers published in the relevant leading journals or attracted many students. As with other programs that had been in a similar situation, the initiative had therefore been cancelled. This decision has been criticized by figures such as former U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Staff Director Kenneth L. Marcus, who is now the director of the Initiative to Combat Anti-Semitism and Anti-Israelism in America's Educational Systems at the Institute for Jewish and Community Research, and Deborah Lipstadt, who described the decision as \"weird\" and \"strange.\" Antony Lerman has supported Yale's decision, describing the YIISA as a politicized initiative that was devoted to the promotion of Israel rather than to serious research on antisemitism.\n\nA 2007 survey by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) concluded that 15% of Americans hold antisemitic views, which was in-line with the average of the previous ten years, but a decline from the 29% of the early sixties. The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, \"with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views.\" The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of Jesus of Nazareth. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech. The 2007 survey also found that 29% of foreign-born Hispanics and 32% of African-Americans hold strong antisemitic beliefs, three times more than the 10% for whites.\n\nA 2009 study published in \"Boston Review\" found that nearly 25% of non-Jewish Americans blamed Jews for the financial crisis of 2008–2009, with a higher percentage among Democrats than Republicans. 32% of Democrats blamed Jews for the financial crisis, versus 18% for Republicans.\n\nIn August 2012, the California state assembly approved a non-binding resolution that \"encourages university leaders to combat a wide array of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel actions,\" although the resolution \"is purely symbolic and does not carry policy implications.\"\n\nIn April 2017, \"Politico Magazine\" published an article purporting to show links between U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Jewish outreach organization Chabad-Lubavitch. The article was widely condemned, with the head of the Anti-Defamation League Jonathan Greenblatt saying that it \"evokes age-old myths about Jews\".\n\nIn November 2017, Jonathan Greenblatt, national director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, stated in an interview, “While anti-Semitic attitudes have remained consistent at 14%... anti-Semitic incidents have been on the rise. In 2016 we saw a 34% increase over the prior year in acts of harassment, vandalism, or violence directed at Jewish individuals and institutions. During the first three quarters of 2017, there was a 67% increase over the same period in 2016. We’ve seen double the number of incidents in K-12 schools, and almost a 60% increase on college campuses.\" \n\nOn October 29, 2018, an antisemitic terrorist attacked the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn a 2009 news story, Michael Rowan and Douglas E. Schoen wrote, \"In an infamous Christmas Eve speech several years ago, Chávez said the Jews killed Christ and have been gobbling up wealth and causing poverty and injustice worldwide ever since.\" Hugo Chávez stated that \"[t]he world is for all of us, then, but it so happens that a minority, the descendants of the same ones that crucified Christ, the descendants of the same ones that kicked Bolívar out of here and also crucified him in their own way over there in Santa Marta, in Colombia. A minority has taken possession of all of the wealth of the world.\"\n\nIn February 2012, opposition candidate for the 2012 Venezuelan presidential election Henrique Capriles was subject to what foreign journalists characterized as vicious attacks by state-run media sources. The \"Wall Street Journal\" said that Capriles \"was vilified in a campaign in Venezuela's state-run media, which insinuated he was, among other things, a homosexual and a Zionist agent\". A 13 February 2012 opinion article in the state-owned Radio Nacional de Venezuela, titled \"The Enemy is Zionism\" attacked Capriles' Jewish ancestry and linked him with Jewish national groups because of a meeting he had held with local Jewish leaders, saying, \"This is our enemy, the Zionism that Capriles today represents... Zionism, along with capitalism, are responsible for 90% of world poverty and imperialist wars.\"\n\n\n"}

Sayings of the Fathers) ( ) is the name given to various collections popularly known as of \"Sayings of the Desert Fathers\", consisting of stories and sayings attributed to the Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers from approximately the 5th century AD.\n\nThe collections consist of wisdom stories describing the spiritual practices and experiences of early Christian hermits living in the desert of Egypt. They are typically in the form of a conversation between a younger monk and his spiritual father, or as advice given to visitors. Beginning as an oral tradition in the Coptic language, they were only later written down as Greek text. The stories were extremely popular among early Christian monks, and appeared in various forms and collections.\n\nThe original sayings were passed down from monk to monk, though in their current version most simply describe the stories in the form of \"Abba X said...\" The early Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers also received many visitors seeking counseling, typically by asking \"Give me a word, \"abba\"\" or \"Speak a word, \"amma\", how can I be saved?\" Some of the sayings are responses to those seeking guidance.\n\nMany notable Desert Fathers are mentioned in the collections, including Anthony the Great, Abba Arsenius, Abba Poemen, Abba Macarius of Egypt, and Abba Moses the Black. The sayings also include those of three different \"ammas\", or Desert Mothers, most notably Syncletica of Alexandria. \"Sayings of the Desert Fathers\" influenced many notable theologians, including Saint Jerome and Saint Augustine.\n\nThe Desert Fathers spoke Coptic, a language related to ancient Egyptian. The sayings were originally passed on orally in that language. The earliest written record of the sayings appears to be from the end of the 4th century AD. Two versions from the 5th century, the \"Collectio Monastica\", written in Ethiopic, and the Asceticon of Abba Isaiah, written in Greek, show how the oral tradition became the written collections.\n\nPelagius and John the Deacon made the first translations of the \"Sayings\" into Latin. Martin of Braga also translated some of the sayings into Latin, followed by a more extensive translation by Paschasius of Dumium in approximately 555 AD. \nThat work may contain only one-fifth of the original Greek text. In the period 867-872 Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki translated the text into Old Church Slavonic, of which the original was lost in the 14th century, but several dozen copies of the \"Патерікъ\" survived. In the 17th century, the Dutch Jesuit Heribert Rosweyde compiled and translated all the available sources on the Desert Fathers and published them in Latin as the \"Vitae patrum\".\n\nHelen Waddell translated a selection of elements from the \"Vitae Patrum\" into English in the early 20th century. The first complete translation of the \"apothegmata\" into English is that of Benedicta Ward (1975).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Written by Mendler, Spencer Bastian, Mischa Chillak and Kaiydo, with Bastian and Chillak serving as producers, it was released as the lead single from the extended play, \"Nemesis\" (2016), through Black Box Media Agency on August 26, 2016. The song is widely considered to be written due to Mendler's split from former boyfriend Shane Harper. \n\nAccording to Mendler, the song discusses the capability of finding love, but feeling like it has disappeared like a lost city, therefore referencing the mythical city of Atlantis. The track was considered by music critics to be a radical departure from her previous work, which featured mainstream, pop music elements. Receiving critical acclaim, critics praised the atmosphere of the song and Mendler's tube distortion voice.\n\nAlong with a series of Twitter posts on her official account teasing the release of Atlantis, Mendler shared the following information concerning the song's production:\n\n\"Atlantis\" is mainly an alt pop, electronica and trip hop song. About it, Mendler stated \"I wrote 'Atlantis' frankly about feeling numb after heartbreak because that's what I was feeling that day we wrote it. Atlantis is a beautiful city that disappeared and was forgotten underwater. That is what it feels like to me to lose a first love. In the story, a remnant of that love is still haunting me even though it is 'asleep with the fishes.'\" She also said to Idolator that \"'Atlantis' is about knowing that I am capable of finding love, but feeling like it has disappeared like a lost city. I wanted to set a haunting tone to the lyrics because the song captures a very tumultuous and transformative time in my life. This song really takes ownership of that.\" On having Kaiydo rap in the song, Mendler said \"I felt the song would be a good one to have a rapper counterpart to add a different perspective. Kaiydo met the tone of the song perfectly.\"\n\n\"Atlantis\" received unanimous praise. Deepa Lakshmin of \"MTV\" labeled the song \"a mellow ode to a past lover\" and said that it's \"a radical departure from Mendler's previous record\", and went on to say that the song is \"cool, refreshing, and totally different.\" Pigeons and Planes' Jacob Moore claimed \"[Atlantis] is a departure from the saccharine flavor of previous singles like 'Ready or Not', an international hit that went platinum in several countries. 'Atlantis' is more complex, a little more difficult to process, but ultimately much more rewarding. It's an immersive piece of modern pop music that feels like something between drowning and floating, or maybe like a little of both.\" Rachel Sonis of Idolator called the song a \"wistful anthem\". \"Noisey\"s Phil Witmer stated \"Mendler's voice is run through tube distortion, chopped up into pinpricks, and becomes a gorgeously vocoded choir on the cavernous hook. It's something like Imogen Heap meeting early Purity Ring, and the guest verse from Florida underground rapper Kaiydo makes 'Atlantis' a masterwork in craft and atmosphere.\" \"Burning Anchor\"s Angus McColl gave \"Atlantis\" a 5/5 star rating stating: \"Overall, \"Atlantis\" feels like a natural departure and radical improvement from 2012's \"Hello My Name Is...\" Mendler creates a soothing, intelligent, mature song which will make you yearn for more.\"\n\nA music video for the song was released on September 27, 2016. Samantha Boscarino, who co-starred with Mendler on \"The Clique\" and \"Good Luck Charlie\", is featured in the music video.\n\nIn an interview with \"Noisey\", Mendler said \"we went through a ton of ideas and when I first got Allie's treatment, her fresh perspective was undeniable. I told her I had my heart set on working with her and from there we found a concept that had dark, satirical, plus heart-aching moments. I break into my ex's house and try to recreate our lost love while he is passed out. Even in the midst of fun and light moments in life, my heart is as limp as his hand hitting my knee while we dance in the kitchen.\"\n\nPhil Witmer of \"Noisey\" stated \"the video fits the song's ambiguity and beguiling nature, with Mendler and her friends literally attempting to resuscitate a past relationship in dreamy vignettes that veer between celebratory and somber.\"\n"}

He had run afoul of the Nazi Party over his unlawful relationship with Irma Eckler, a Jewish woman. He was later imprisoned and eventually drafted into penal military service, where he was killed in action; Eckler was sent to a concentration camp where it is presumed she was killed.\n\nAugust Landmesser was the only child of August Franz Landmesser and Wilhelmine Magdalene (née Schmidtpott). In 1931, hoping it would help him get a job, he joined the Nazi Party. In 1935, when he became engaged to Irma Eckler (a Jewish woman), he was expelled from the party. They registered to be married in Hamburg, but the Nuremberg Laws enacted a month later prevented it. On 29 October 1935, Landmesser and Eckler's first daughter, Ingrid, was born.\n\nA now-famous photograph, in which a man identified as Landmesser refuses to give the Nazi salute, was taken on 13 June 1936.\n\nIn 1937, Landmesser and Eckler tried to flee to Denmark but were apprehended. She was again pregnant, and he was charged and found guilty in July 1937 of \"dishonoring the race\" under Nazi racial laws. He argued that neither he nor Eckler knew that she was fully Jewish, and was acquitted on 27 May 1938 for lack of evidence, with the warning that a repeat offense would result in a multi-year prison sentence. The couple publicly continued their relationship, and on 15 July 1938 he was arrested again and sentenced to two and a half years in the Börgermoor concentration camp.\n\nEckler was detained by the Gestapo and held at the prison Fuhlsbüttel, where she gave birth to a second daughter, Irene. From there she was sent to the Oranienburg concentration camp, the Lichtenburg concentration camp for women, and then the women's concentration camp at Ravensbrück. A few letters came from Irma Eckler until January 1942. It is believed that she was taken to the Bernburg Euthanasia Centre in February 1942, where she was among the 14,000 killed; in the course of post-war documentation, in 1949 she was pronounced legally dead, with a date of 28 April 1942.\n\nMeanwhile, Landmesser was discharged from prison on 19 January 1941. He worked as a foreman for the haulage company Püst. The company had a branch at the Heinkel-Werke (factory) in Warnemünde. In February 1944 he was drafted into a penal battalion, the 999th Fort Infantry Battalion. He was declared killed in action, after being killed during fighting in Croatia on 17 October 1944. Like Eckler, he was legally declared dead in 1949.\n\nTheir children were initially taken to the city orphanage. Ingrid was later allowed to live with her maternal grandmother while Irene went to the home of foster parents in 1941. Ingrid was also placed with foster parents after her grandmother's death in 1953.\n\nThe marriage of August Landmesser and Irma Eckler was recognized retroactively by the Senate of Hamburg in the summer of 1951, and in the autumn of that year Ingrid assumed the surname \"Landmesser\". Irene continued to use the surname \"Eckler\".\n\nIn 1996, Irene Eckler published the book \"Die Vormundschaftsakte 1935–1958: Verfolgung einer Familie wegen \"Rassenschande\"\" (\"The Guardianship Documents 1935–1958: Persecution of a Family for \"Racial Disgrace\"\"). The book tells the story of her family, and includes a large number of original documents from the time in question, including letters from her mother and documents from state institutions.\n\nA figure identified by Irene Eckler as August Landmesser is featured in a photograph taken on 13 June 1936, published on 22 March 1991 in \"Die Zeit\". It shows a large gathering of workers at the Blohm+Voss shipyard in Hamburg, for the launching of the navy training ship \"Horst Wessel\". Almost everyone in the image has raised his arm in the Nazi salute, with the most obvious exception of a man toward the back of the crowd, who grimly stands with his arms crossed over his chest. Several others have also refrained from saluting, but are not so obviously defiant.\n\nWhether the depicted man is Landmesser is not known with certainty. Another family claims the person in the photo is another metalworker at Blohm & Voss, a man called Gustav Wegert. The content and photos posted by relatives of Wegert and more recent photographic enhancements make it more likely that the person in the photo refusing to perform the Nazi salute was Gustav Wegert.\n"}

She has the notable distinction of having written the screenplay for both the first Argentine film nominated for an Academy Award (\"The Truce\", 1974) and the first Argentine film to win an Academy Award (\"La historia oficial\").\n\nAfter starting out as a TV-screenwriter in 1971, Bortnik co-wrote with débutant director Sergio Renán the screenplay for \"The Truce\" (1974), based on the eponymous novel by Mario Benedetti. It was the first Argentine film to be nominated for an Academy Award (the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film) in 1975, but lost out to Federico Fellini's\n\"Amarcord\". That year, Bortnik co-wrote \"Una mujer\", directed by Juan José Stagnaro. After a three-year break, Bortnik worked one more time with Renán in writing a screenplay in 1977 for Haroldo Conti's novel, \"Crecer de golpe\". She then co-wrote \"La isla\" (1979) with director Alejandro Doria. \n\nIn 1985, Bortnik co-wrote with writer-director Luis Puenzo a screenplay for a film about the Argentine Dirty War, which had recently ceased.

The film is directed by Dee Rees, with a screenplay by Rees, Christopher Cleveland and Bettina Gilois. Queen Latifah stars as Smith, and supporting roles are played by Michael Kenneth Williams as Smith's first husband Jack Gee, and Mo'Nique as Ma Rainey. The film premiered on May 16, 2015.\n\nBy the following year \"Bessie\" stood as the most watched HBO original film of all time. The film was well received critically and garnered four Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Television Movie.\n\nBessie Smith (Queen Latifah) is a young singer from Chattanooga, Tennessee. She and her siblings are orphaned when their parents, William and Laura, die, leaving their oldest sister, Viola (Khandi Alexander), to raise them. Viola is stern and Bessie's childhood is unhappy. She along with her brother Clarence (Tory Kittles) scrape by working for local vaudeville shows. Her stage ambitions are frustrated by producers unwilling to feature dark-skinned black women in their shows. Bessie sneaks onto traveling performer Ma Rainey's (Mo'Nique) train compartment and asks to join her show. Ma Rainey takes Bessie under her wing and helps her develop her abilities until Bessie's popularity causes a schism between the two women. Bessie leaves with Clarence to start her own show.\n\nIn addition to her lover Lucille (Tika Sumpter), Bessie begins a tumultuous relationship with Jack Gee (Michael K. Williams), a security guard who later becomes her husband and manager. After a humiliating rejection from the newly formed Black Swan Records, Jack manages to get Bessie a record deal with Columbia Records. Immense success follows, though Bessie encounters difficulties, including a stabbing attack after a show in her hometown, racism from white guests during an affluent party, and an attack during her show by the Ku Klux Klan, whom she courageously chases off. Eventually, Bessie reconciles with Viola, and moves her and all of her siblings into a mansion to live with her. The move causes additional tension with Jack, and Bessie pushes him further by adopting a young boy, whom she names Jack Jr., as their son. Eventually, Lucille leaves Bessie in order to have her own life. Despite her own affair with bootlegger Richard Morgan (Mike Epps), Bessie is infuriated upon discovering that Jack is bankrolling his mistress, up and coming performer Gertrude Saunders. After a violent quarrel, Jack leaves her. Bessie spirals into depression and alcohol. Jack returns, kidnapping Jack Jr. with the assistance of Viola, and takes him to live with him, contending that Bessie is an unfit mother.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Bessie's fortune dissolves, and she and Clarence move into a small apartment. Bessie reconciles with Ma Rainey and takes some time to recuperate from her personal losses. Eventually, she accepts Richard's love for her and the two begin a relationship. After hearing Lucille Bogan's licentious hit song \"Til the Cows Come Home\", Bessie performs once again and meets a young John Hammond who wishes to produce her comeback tour. Bessie's comeback is a success and she later reflects on her life while discussing the future with Richard.\n\n\nA first draft screenplay was written by playwright Horton Foote at a time when Columbia Pictures was slated to produce the film, but the project died when the studio became involved in a financial irregularity that threatened its existence. Mr. Foote purchased his screenplay back from Columbia and acquired the film rights from biographer Chris Albertson. In the early 1990s, when the possibility of producers Richard D. Zanuck and Lili Fini Zanuck taking over the project arose, Albertson suggested Queen Latifah for the lead, but the project lay dormant when financing could not be found. Upon Horton Foote's death in 2009, the script and film rights became the property of his daughter, actress Hallie Foote, who took it to the Zanucks and HBO. Thus, press releases claim that \"Bessie\" has been \"22 years in the making.\" As part of the HBO deal, Queen Latifah is credited as one of the executive producers. The project was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nAn early article announcing the HBO film indicated it would be based on \"Bessie\", a 1972 biography by Chris Albertson, but a year later the book was not included in the film's credits or promotion, nor did the end result bear but a peripheral resemblance to Albertson's book.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics, with many critics praising the performances of Queen Latifah, Mo'Nique, and Khandi Alexander, while criticizing the use of the \"Hollywood biopic\" formula. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a score of 87% based on 15 critic reviews. Metacritic gave the film a score of 75 out of 100 based on 20 critic reviews.\n\nAs of 2016, Bessie remained the most watched HBO original movie of all time with 1.34 million viewers and a 18-49 demo rating of 0.4.\n\n"}

It is a place where \"hens lay soft boiled eggs\" and there are \"cigarette trees.\" McClintock claimed to have written the song in 1895, based on tales from his youth hoboing through the United States, but some believe that at least aspects of the song have existed for far longer. It is catalogued as Roud Folk Song Index No. 6696.\n\nThe song was first recorded by McClintock, also known by his \"hobo\" name of Haywire Mac. McClintock claimed credit for writing the song, though it was likely partially based on other ballads, including \"An Invitation to Lubberland\" and \"The Appleknocker's Lament\". Other popular itinerant songs of the day such as \"Hobo's Paradise\", \"Hobo Heaven\", \"Sweet Potato Mountains\" and \"Little Streams of Whiskey\" likely served as inspiration, as they mention concepts similar to those in \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\".\n\nBefore recording the song, McClintock cleaned it up considerably from the version he sang as a street busker in the 1890s. Originally the song described a child being recruited into hobo life by tales of the \"big rock candy mountain\". In later years, when McClintock appeared in court as part of a copyright dispute, he cited the original words of the song, the last stanza of which was:\n\nIn the released version this verse did not appear.\n\nThe song was not popularized until 1939, when it peaked at #1 on \"Billboard\" magazine's country music charts. But it achieved more widespread popularity in 1949 when a sanitized version intended for children was re-recorded by Burl Ives. It has been recorded by many artists throughout the world, but a version recorded in 1960 by Dorsey Burnette to date was the biggest success for the song in the post-1954 \"rock era\", having reached No. 102 on Billboard's chart.\n\nSanitized versions have been popular, especially with children's musicians; in these, the \"cigarette trees\" become peppermint trees, and the \"streams of alcohol\" trickling down the rocks become streams of lemonade. The lake of gin is not mentioned, and the lake of whiskey becomes a lake of soda pop. The 2008 extended adaptation for children by Gil McLachlan tells the story as a child's dream, the last stanza being:\n\nFolklorist John Greenway published the song in his \"American Folksongs of Protest\" (1953), redacting only the second to last line. Bowdlerized versions are included in Irwin Silber's \"Songs of the Great American West\" (1967) and Alan Lomax's \"The Penguin Book of American Folk Songs\" (1964).\n\nA folk version of the song is included in the Gordon \"Inferno\" Collection in the Library of Congress, under the title \"The Appleknocker's Lament\".\n\n\n\n\nA cluster of brightly colored hills just north of Marysvale, Utah, near the Fishlake National Forest, is named the \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\". In 1928, after the song had been released, some Utah residents jokingly placed a sign at the base of the hills labeling it the \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\", along with a sign next to a nearby spring proclaiming it \"Lemonade Springs\". The Big Rock Candy Mountain Resort currently sits at the base of the hills and is a major hub on the Paiute ATV trail.\n\nOther rock formations in the United States have also borrowed the name of the song; the largest exposed rock in the South Platte rock climbing area of Colorado is also called \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\" because of its colored stripes resembling a candy cane. Additionally, one of the peaks in the Capitol State Forest in Washington State is named \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "371150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371150", "title": "Brian O'Nolan", "text": "Brian O'Nolan\n\nBrian O'Nolan (; 5 October 1911 – 1 April 1966) was an Irish novelist, playwright and satirist, considered a major figure in twentieth century Irish literature. Born in Strabane, County Tyrone, he is regarded as a key figure in postmodern literature. His English language novels, such as \"At Swim-Two-Birds\" and \"The Third Policeman\", were written under the pen name Flann O'Brien. His many satirical columns in \"The Irish Times\" and an Irish language novel \"An Béal Bocht\" were written under the name Myles na gCopaleen.\n\nO'Nolan's novels have attracted a wide following for their bizarre humour and modernist metafiction. As a novelist, O'Nolan was influenced by James Joyce. He was nonetheless sceptical of the cult of Joyce which overshadows much of Irish writing, saying \"I declare to God if I hear that name Joyce one more time I will surely froth at the gob.\"\n\nO'Nolan attended Blackrock College where he was taught English by President of the College, and future Archbishop, John Charles McQuaid.\n\nAccording to Farragher and Wyer:\n\nDr McQuaid himself was recognised as an outstanding English teacher, and when one of his students, Brian O'Nolan, alias Myles na gCopaleen, boasted in his absence to the rest of the class that there were only two people in the College who could write English properly namely, Dr McQuaid and himself, they had no hesitation in agreeing. And Dr McQuaid did Myles the honour of publishing a little verse by him in the first issue of the revived College Annual (1930) – this being Myles' first published item.\n\nThe poem itself, \"Ad Astra\", read as follows:\n<poem>\nAh! When the skies at night\nAre damascened with gold,\nMethinks the endless sight\nEternity unrolled.\n</poem>\n\nO'Nolan also spent part of his schooling years in Synge Street Christian Brothers School. His novel The Hard Life, is a semi autobiographical depiction of his experience of the Christian Brothers.\n\nO'Nolan wrote prodigiously during his years as a student at University College, Dublin (UCD), where he was an active, and controversial, member of the well known Literary and Historical Society. He contributed to the student magazine \"Comhthrom Féinne\" (\"Fair Play\") under various guises, in particular the pseudonym Brother Barnabas. Significantly, he composed a story during this same period titled \"Scenes in a Novel (probably posthumous) by Brother Barnabas\", which anticipates many of the ideas and themes later to be found in his novel, \"At Swim-Two-Birds\". In it, the putative author of the story finds himself in riotous conflict with his characters, who are determined to follow their own paths regardless of the author's design. For example, the villain of the story, one Carruthers McDaid, intended by the author as the lowest form of scoundrel, \"meant to sink slowly to absolutely the last extremities of human degradation\", instead ekes out a modest living selling cats to elderly ladies and becomes a covert churchgoer without the author's consent. Meanwhile, the story's hero, Shaun Svoolish, chooses a comfortable, bourgeois life rather than romance and heroics:\n\nIn 1934 O'Nolan and his student friends founded a short-lived magazine called \"Blather\". The writing here, though clearly bearing the marks of youthful bravado, again somewhat anticipates O'Nolan's later work, in this case his \"Cruiskeen Lawn\" column as Myles na gCopaleen:\n\nO'Nolan, who had studied German in Dublin, may have spent at least parts of 1933 and 1934 in Germany, namely in Cologne and Bonn, although details are uncertain and contested. He claimed himself, in 1965, that he \"spent many months in the Rhineland and at Bonn drifting away from the strict pursuit of study.\" So far, no external evidence has turned up that would back up this sojourn (or an also anecdotal short-term marriage to one 'Clara Ungerland' from Cologne). In their biography Costello and van de Kamp, discussing the inconclusive evidence, state that \"...it must remain a mystery, in the absence of documented evidence an area of mere speculation, representing in a way the other mysteries of life of Brian O'Nolan that still defy the researcher.\"\n\nA key feature of O'Nolan's personal situation was his status as an Irish government civil servant, who, as a result of his father's relatively early death, was obliged to support ten siblings, including an elder brother who was an unsuccessful writer. Given the desperate poverty of Ireland in the 1930s to 1960s, a job as a civil servant was considered prestigious, being both secure and pensionable with a reliable cash income in a largely agrarian economy. The Irish civil service has been, since the Irish Civil War, fairly strictly apolitical: Civil Service Regulations and the service's internal culture generally prohibit Civil Servants above the level of clerical officer from publicly expressing political views. As a practical matter, this meant that writing in newspapers on current events was, during O'Nolan's career, generally prohibited without departmental permission on an article-by-article, publication-by-publication basis. This fact alone contributed to O'Nolan's use of pseudonyms, though he had started to create character-authors even in his pre-civil service writings. O'Nolan rose to be quite senior, serving a private secretary to Seán T. O'Kelly (a minister and later President of Ireland) and Seán McEntee, a powerful political figure, both of whom almost certainly knew O'Nolan was na gCopaleen.\n\nIn reality, that O'Nolan was Flann O'Brien and Myles na gCopaleen was an open secret, largely disregarded by his colleagues, who found his writing very entertaining; this was a function of the makeup of the civil service, which recruited leading graduates by competitive examination—it was an erudite and relatively liberal body in the Ireland of the 1930s to the 1970s. Nonetheless, had O'Nolan forced the issue, by using one of his known pseudonyms or his own name for an article that seriously upset politicians, consequences would likely have followed—hence the acute pseudonym problem in attributing his work today. He was, indeed, forced to retire from the civil service in 1953. \"A combination of his gradually deepening alcoholism and his habit of making derogatory remarks about senior politicians in his newspaper columns led to his forced retirement from the civil service in 1953. (He departed, recalled a colleague, \"in a final fanfare of f***s\".)\n\nAlthough O'Nolan was a well known character in Dublin during his lifetime, relatively little is known about his personal life. He joined the Irish civil service in 1935, working in the Department of Local Government. From the time of his father's death in 1937, he supported his brothers and sisters, eleven in total, on his income. On 2 December 1948 he married Evelyn McDonnell, a typist in the Department of Local Government. On his marriage he moved from his parental home in Blackrock to nearby Merrion Avenue, living at several further locations in South Dublin before his death. The couple had no children.\n\nO'Nolan was an alcoholic for much of his life and suffered from ill health in his later years. He suffered from cancer of the throat and died from a heart attack on the morning of 1 April 1966.\n\nAs Myles na gCopaleen (or Myles na Gopaleen), O'Nolan wrote short columns for \"The Irish Times\", mostly in English but also in Irish, which showed a manic imagination that still astonishes.\n\nHis newspaper column, \"Cruiskeen Lawn\" (transliterated from the Irish \"crúiscín lán\", \"full/brimming small-jug\"), has its origins in a series of pseudonymous letters written to \"The Irish Times\", originally intended to mock the publication in that same newspaper of a poem, \"Spraying the Potatoes\", by the writer Patrick Kavanagh:\n\nThe letters, some written by O'Nolan and some not, continued under a variety of false names, using various styles and assaulting varied topics, including other letters by the same authors. The letters were a hit with the readers of \"The Irish Times\", and R. M. Smyllie, then editor of the newspaper, shortly invited O'Nolan to contribute a column. Importantly, the Irish Times maintained that there were in fact three pseudonymous authors of the Cruiskeen Lawn column, which provided a certain amount of cover for O'Nolan as a civil servant when a column was particularly provocative.\n\nThe first column appeared on 4 October 1940, under the pseudonym \"An Broc\" (\"The Badger\"). In all subsequent columns the name \"Myles na gCopaleen\" (\"Myles of the Little Horses\" or \"Myles of the Ponies\" - a name taken from The Collegians, a novel by Gerald Griffin) was used. Initially, the column was composed in Irish, but soon English was used primarily, with occasional smatterings of German, French or Latin. The sometimes intensely satirical column's targets included the Dublin literary elite, Irish language revivalists, the Irish government, and the \"Plain People of Ireland.\" The following column excerpt, in which the author wistfully recalls a brief sojourn in Germany as a student, illustrates the biting humor and scorn that informed the \"Cruiskeen Lawn\" writings:\n\nÓ Nuallain/na gCopaleen wrote \"Cruiskeen Lawn\" for \"The Irish Times\" until the year of his death, 1966.\n\nHe contributed substantially to \"Envoy\" (he was \"honorary editor\" for the special number featuring James Joyce) and formed part of the \"Envoy\" / McDaid's pub circle of artistic and literary figures that included Patrick Kavanagh, Anthony Cronin, Brendan Behan, John Jordan, Pearse Hutchinson, J.P. Donleavy and artist Desmond MacNamara who, at the author's request, created the book cover for the first edition of \"The Dalkey Archive\". O'Nolan also contributed to \"The Bell\". He also wrote a column titled \"Bones of Contention\" for the \"Nationalist and Leinster Times\" under the pseudonym George Knowall; those were collected in the volume \"Myles Away From Dublin\".\n\nMost of his later writings were occasional pieces published in periodicals, which explains why his work has only recently come to enjoy the considered attention of literary scholars. O'Nolan was notorious for his prolific use and creation of pseudonyms for much of his writing, including short stories, essays, and letters to editors, which has rendered the compilation of a complete bibliography of his writings an almost impossible task. He allegedly would write letters to the editor of \"The Irish Times\" complaining about his own articles published in that newspaper, for example in his regular \"Cruiskeen Lawn\" column, or irate, eccentric and even mildly deranged pseudonymous responses to his own pseudonymous letters, which gave rise to rampant speculation as to whether the author of a published letter existed or not. Not surprisingly, little of O'Nolan's pseudonymous activity has been verified.\n\nO'Nolan's journalistic pseudonym is taken from a character (Myles-na-Coppaleen) in Dion Boucicault's play \"The Colleen Bawn\" (itself an adaptation of Gerald Griffin's \"The Collegians\"), who is the stereotypical charming Irish rogue. At one point in the play, he sings the ancient anthem of the Irish Brigades on the Continent, the song \"An Crúiscín Lán\" (hence the name of the column in the \"Irish Times\").\n\n\"Capall\" is the Irish word for \"horse\" (from Vulgar Latin \"caballus\"), and 'een' (spelled \"ín\" in Irish) is a diminutive suffix. The prefix \"na gCapaillín\" is the genitive plural in his Ulster Irish dialect (the Standard Irish would be \"Myles na gCapaillíní\"), so Myles na gCopaleen means \"Myles of the Little Horses\". \"Capaillín\" is also the Irish word for \"pony\", as in the name of Ireland's most famous and ancient native horse breed, the Connemara pony.\n\nO'Nolan himself always insisted on the translation \"Myles of the Ponies\", saying that he did not see why the principality of the pony should be subjugated to the imperialism of the horse.\n\n\"At Swim-Two-Birds\" works entirely with borrowed (and stolen) characters from other fiction and legend, on the grounds that there are already far too many existing fictional characters.\n\n\"At Swim-Two-Birds\" is now recognised as one of the most significant modernist novels before 1945. Indeed it can be seen as a pioneer of postmodernism, although the academic Keith Hopper has argued that \"The Third Policeman\", superficially less radical, is actually a more deeply subversive and proto-postmodernist work, and as such, possibly a representation of literary nonsense.\n\n\"At Swim-Two-Birds\" was one of the last books that James Joyce read and he praised it to O'Nolan's friends—praise which was subsequently used for years as a blurb on reprints of O'Brien's novels. The book was also praised by Graham Greene, who was working as a reader when the book was put forward for publication and also the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, whose work might be said to bear some similarities to that of O'Brien.\n\nThe British writer Anthony Burgess stated, \"If we don't cherish the work of Flann O'Brien we are stupid fools who don't deserve to have great men. Flann O'Brien is a very great man.\" Burgess included \"At Swim-Two-Birds\" on his list of \"Ninety-Nine Novels: The Best in English since 1939\".\n\n\"At Swim-Two-Birds\" has had a troubled publication history in the USA. Southern Illinois University Press has set up a Flann O'Brien Center and begun publishing all of O'Nolan's works. Consequently, academic attention to the novel has increased.\n\nThe rejection of \"The Third Policeman\" by publishers in his lifetime had a profound effect on O'Nolan. This is perhaps reflected in \"The Dalkey Archive\", in which sections of \"The Third Policeman\" are recycled almost word for word, namely the atomic theory and the character De Selby.\n\n\"The Third Policeman\" has a fantastic plot of a murderous protagonist let loose on a strange world peopled by fat policemen, played against a satire of academic debate on an eccentric philosopher called De Selby. Sergeant Pluck introduces the atomic theory of the bicycle.\n\n\"The Dalkey Archive\" features a character who encounters a penitent, elderly and apparently unbalanced James Joyce (who dismissively refers to his work by saying 'I have published little' and, furthermore, does not seem aware of having written and published \"Finnegans Wake\") working as an assistant barman or 'curate'—another small joke relating to Joyce's alleged priestly ambitions—in the resort of Skerries. The scientist De Selby seeks to suck all of the air out of the world, and Policeman Pluck learns of the mollycule theory from Sergeant Fottrell. \"The Dalkey Archive\" was adapted for the stage in September 1965 by Hugh Leonard as \"The Saints Go Cycling In\".\n\nOther books written by O'Nolan include \"An Béal Bocht\"—translated from the Irish as \"The Poor Mouth\"—(a parody of Tomás Ó Criomhthain's autobiography \"An t-Oileánach\"—in English \"The Islander\"), and \"The Hard Life\" (a fictional autobiography meant to be his \"misterpiece\").\n\nO'Nolan's theatrical output was unsuccessful. \"Faustus Kelly\", a play about a local councillor selling his soul to the devil for a seat in the Dáil, ran for only 11 performances in 1943. A second play, \"Rhapsody in Stephen's Green\", also called \"The Insect Play\", was a reworking of the Capek Brothers' synonymous play using anthropomorphised insects to satirise society. It also was put on in 1943 but quickly folded, possibly because of the offence it gave to various interests including Catholics, Ulster Protestants, Irish civil servants, Corkmen, and the Fianna Fail party. The play was thought lost, but was rediscovered in 1994 in the archives of Northwestern University.\n\nIn 1956, O'Nolan was co-producer of a production for RTÉ, the Irish broadcaster, of \"3 Radio Ballets\", which was just what it said it was—a dance performance in three parts designed for and performed on radio.\n\nO'Brien influenced the science fiction writer and conspiracy theory satirist Robert Anton Wilson, who has O'Brien's character De Selby, an obscure intellectual in \"The Third Policeman\" and \"The Dalkey Archive\", appear in his own \"The Widow's Son\". In both \"The Third Policeman\" and \"The Widow's Son\", De Selby is the subject of long pseudo-scholarly footnotes. This is fitting, because O'Brien himself made free use of characters invented by other writers, claiming that there were too many fictional characters as is. O'Brien was also known for pulling the reader's leg by concocting elaborate conspiracy theories.\n\nIn 2011 the '100 Myles: The International Flann O'Brien Centenary Conference' (24–27 July) was held at The Department of English Studies at the University of Vienna, the success of which led to the establishment of 'The International Flann O'Brien Society'. In October 2011, Trinity College Dublin hosted a weekend of events celebrating the centenary of his birth. A commemorative 55c stamp featuring a portrait of O'Nolan's head as drawn by his brother Micheál Ó Nualláin was issued for the same occasion. This occurred some 52 years after the writer's famous criticism of the Irish postal service. A bronze sculpture of the writer stands outside the Palace Bar on Dublin's Fleet Street. Kevin Myers said, \"Had Myles escaped he might have become a literary giant.\" Fintan O'Toole said of O'Nolan \"he could have been a celebrated national treasure – but he was far too radical for that.\" An award winning radio play by Albrecht Behmel called \"Ist das Ihr Fahrrad, Mr. O'Brien?\" brought his life and work to the attention of a broader German audience in 2003.\n\nO'Nolan has also been semi-seriously referred to as a \"scientific prophet\" in relation to his writings on thermodynamics, quaternion theory and atomic theory.\n\nIn 2012, on the 101st anniversary of his birth, O'Nolan was honoured with a commemorative Google Doodle.\n\nHis life and works were celebrated on BBC Radio 4's \"Great Lives\" in December 2017.\n\n\nSelections of \"Cruiskeen Lawn\" columns have been published in seven collections:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "429508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429508", "title": "Buile Shuibhne", "text": "Buile Shuibhne\n\nBuile Shuibhne or Buile Suibhne (, The Madness of Suibhne or Suibhne's Frenzy) is an old Irish tale about the Suibhne mac Colmain, king of the Dál nAraidi, driven insane by St. Ronan's curse. The insanity makes Suibhne leave the Battle of Mag Rath, enter a life of wandering (which earns him the nickname Suibne Geilt or \"Mad Sweeney\"), until he dies under the refuge of St. Moling.\n\nThe tale is the final installment of a three-text cycle in Irish bardic poetry, continuing on from \"Fled Dúin na nGéd\" (\"The Feast of Dun na nGéd\") and \"Cath Maige Rátha\" (\"The Battle of Mag Rath\").\n\nSuibhne's name appears as early as the ninth century in a law tract (\"Book of Aicill\"), but \"Buile Suibhne\" did not take its current form until the twelfth century. includes a detailed analysis of the language and date of the text.\n\nThe identity of Suibhne is a very convoluted matter as several texts mention different Suibhnes in regards with the Battle of Mag Rath. Buile Suibhne specifies Suibhne as the son of Colman Cuar and as the pagan king of Dál nAraidi in Ulster in Ireland (in particular in the areas of present-day county Down and county Antrim). This particular Suibhne son of Colman's name can also be found in the \"Annals of Tigernach\" and the Book of Lismore. The \"Annals of Tigernach\" state Suibhne, son of Colman, died in the Battle of Mag Rath, making Buile seem a fanciful imagining of dead warrior. Historical records of Dál nAraidi do exist. It was a historical kingdom inhabited by the Cruthin. However the king lists of Dál nAraidi in the Book of Leinster fail to mention any Suibhne son of Colman Cuar as king, and identifies Congal Claen as king of Dál nAraidi during this time. James G. O’Keeffe has hypothesized a possible scenario where Suibhne might have been elected by the Cruthin to act as regent in the midst of King Congal's exile.\n\nThere are three manuscripts, B (Royal Irish Academy, B iv i), 1671–4; K (Royal Irish Academy, 23 K 44), 1721–2; and L (Brussels, 3410), 1629, a condensed version in the hand of Michael O'Clery. The text can be dated to broadly from 1200–1500 on linguistic grounds, but John O'Donovan asserted the writer must have lived before 1197 when the last chieftain of Tir Connail died who was descended from Domnall mac Áedo, since the work is intended to flatter this monarchic dynasty. \n\nIn the legend, while St. Ronan was marking boundaries for a new church, the sound of his bell reached Suibhne's ear. Suibhne, upon learning that this was church-making activity on his grounds, rushed out to expel St. Ronan from his territory. His wife Eorann tried to detain him by grabbing his cloak, which unraveled, leaving Suibhne to exit the house stark naked. Suibhne grabbed Ronan's Psalter and threw it into the lake, and seized the Saint by the hand and started to drag him away. But Suibhne was interrupted by a messenger from Congal Claen requesting aid in the Battle of Mag Rath (near modern Moira, 637 A.D.).\n\nThe next day, the Psalter was returned unharmed by an otter that fetched it from the lake. The saint laid a curse upon Suibhne, condemning him to wander and fly around the world naked, and to meet his death by spear-point. In the ongoing war, St. Ronan had mediated a truce to last from each evening until morning, but Suibhne habitually broke this by killing during the hours when combat was not permitted.\n\nOne day, Bishop Ronan and his psalmists were on their round blessing the troops. Suibhne too received the sprinkling of holy water, but taking this as a taunt, he killed one of the bishop's psalmists with a spear, and cast another at Ronan himself. The weapon pierced a hole in Ronan's bell (hanging on his breast), and the broken-off shaft hurled in the air. At this, Ronan repeated the same curse: that Suibhne will wander like a bird, much as the spear-shaft, perch on tree branches at the sound of the bell, and die by the spear just as he had killed the monk. When battle resumed, the tremendous noise of the armies clashing drove Suibhne insane. His hands were numbed, his weapons fell, and he began to tread ever so lightly as a bird levitating in the air. (It is revealed much later on that like a bird, feathers had grown on him.)\n\nThe deranged Suibhne then left the battlefield behind, reaching a forest called Ros Bearaigh, in Glenn Earcain and perched on a yew tree. He was discovered by his kinsman Aongus the Fat, who was making his retreat from battle. Suibhne fled to Cell Riagain in Tir Conaill, alighting on another tree. There he was surrounded by the forces of Domnall mac Áedo, which was the side Suibhne and his Dál nAraidi kinsmen were warring against. The victorious Domnall nevertheless praised and pitied Suibhne and offered him gifts, but the madman would not comply.\n\nSuibhne went to his home territory of Glenn Bolcáin, wandered seven years throughout Ireland, and returned to Glenn Bolcain, which was where his fortress and dwelling stood, and a celebrated valley of madmen. Suibhne's movement was now being tracked by his kinsman Loingsechan, who had successfully taken the madman into custody thrice before. Loingsechan in his millhouse had a chance to capture Suibhne, but the attempt failed, and he must await another chance. Suibhne then paid visit to his wife, who was living with another man, a contender for Suibhne's kingship. Eorann maintained she would rather be with Suibhne, but he told her to remain with her new husband. An army stormed in, but Suibhne eluded capture.\n\nSuibhne then returned to the yew tree at Ros Bearaigh, the same tree he went to when he first developed his madness, but when Eorann came to deceive and capture him, he moved away to another tree in Ros Ercain. But his whereabouts was discovered, and Loingsechan coaxed him out of the tree, tricking him with the false news that his entire family had perished. Loingsechan brought Suibhne back to normal life and restored his sanity, but while recuperating, the mill hag taunted him into a contest of leaping. As they leapt, the noise of a hunting party returned Suibhne to madness. The mill hag eventually fell from her leap and was dashed to pieces. And since she was Loingsechan's mother-in-law, it meant Suibhne's could not return to Dál nAraidi without facing vengeance.\n\nSubhne subsequently wandered various parts of Ireland, into Scotland and Western England. He went from Roscommon to Slieve Aughty, Slieve Mis, Slieve Bloom mountain ranges; Inismurray island; the Cave of St. Donnan of Eigg, an island in the Scottish Inner Hebrides; then tarried for a month and a half in \"Carrick Alastair\" (Ailsa Craig off Scotland. He reached Britain and befriended a Fer Caille (Man of the Wood), who was another madman, spending an entire year together. The Briton giant met his predestined death by drowning in a waterfall.\n\n\"Fly through the air like the shaft of his spear and that he might die of a spear cast like the cleric whom he had slain.\"\n\nSuibhne then returned to Ireland, to his home dominion of Glen Bocain. He visited his wife Eorann again but refused to go in the house for fear of confinement. Eorann then told him to leave, never to return, because the sight of him was an embarrassment to all. But after a while, Suibhne regained his lucidity and made his resolve to go back to Dál nAraidi, whatever judgment may befall him. St. Ronan learned of this and prayed to God to hinder Suibhne. Suibhne is haunted by headless cadavers and detached heads at Sliabh Fuaid.\n\nEventually, Suibhne arrived at \"The House of St. Moling\", i.e. Teach Moling (St Mullin's in Co. Carlow), and Moling harbored him after hearing the madman's story. It might be noted that earlier, Suibhne had sung a stave predicting this place to be the place where he would meet his demise, and likewise, the Saint also knew this to be the madman's resting place. As Suibhne attended Moling's vespers, the priest instructed a parish woman employed as his cook to provide the madman with a meal (collation), in the form of daily milk. She did so by emptying milk into a hole she made with her foot in the cow dung. However, her husband (Moling's herder) believed malicious hearsay about the two having a tryst, and in a fit of jealousy, thrust a spear into Suibhne while he was drinking from the hole. Thus Suibhne died in the manner prescribed by Ronan, but received his sacrament from Moling, \"as eric\".\n\nThe poetry in the story of Suibhne is rich and accomplished, and the story itself of the mad and exiled king who composes verse as he travels has held the imagination of poets through to the twentieth century. At every stop in his flight, Suibhne pauses to give a poem on the location and his plight, and his descriptions of the countryside and nature, as well as his pathos, are central to the development of the text. Ó Béarra (2014) includes a detailed analysis of the poetry.\n\nMany poets have invoked Sweeney – most notably T. S. Eliot and Seamus Heaney. Heaney published a translation of the work into English, which he entitled \"Sweeney Astray\". Eliot made Sweeney the central figure in his verse drama \"Sweeney Agonistes\". The author Flann O'Brien incorporated much of the story of \"Buile Shuibhne\" into his comic novel \"At Swim-Two-Birds\", whose title is the English translation of the place name \"Snamh da en\" in the tale. Another version from the Irish text, titled \"The Poems of Sweeny, Peregrine\", was published by the Irish poet Trevor Joyce.\n\nA modern Irish version of Buile Shuibhne was published in 2010 by Seán Ó Sé. This was the first time that the full original text was made available in modern Irish.\n\nSweeney also appears as a character in Neil Gaiman's novel \"American Gods\" and is portrayed by Pablo Schreiber in its TV adaptation. A contemporary version of the legend by poet Patricia Monaghan explores Sweeney as an archetype of the warrior suffering from \"Soldier's Heart\".\n\nW. D. Snodgrass introduces his poem \"Heart's Needle\" with a reference to \"The Madness of Suibhne\".\n\nIrish poet and playwright Paula Meehan loosely based her 1997 drama \"Mrs. Sweeney\" on the Sweeney legend. Set in an inner-city Dublin flat complex called The Maria Goretti Mansions (a metaphor for the notorious Fatima Mansions Flats in Dublin), the play examines what life must have been like for Sweeney's wife; as Meehan states, \"I wondered what it must have been like to be his woman.\" The play charts the trials and tribulations of Lil Sweeney's life in the Maria Goretti flats as she deals with crime, poverty, unemployment, drug abuse, and tries to come to terms with the premature death of her daughter Chrisse, a heroin addict who died a year before the action starts from an AIDS related illness. Lil's husband, Sweeney, is a pigeon fancier who, upon discovering that all his pigeons have been killed, retreats into a bird-like state.\n\nIrish composer Frank Corcoran wrote a series of works between 1996 and 2003 around the tale. This includes the choral work \"Buile Suibhne / Mad Sweeney\" (1996, after Heaney), the electro-acoustic composition \"Sweeney's Vision\" (1997), and the chamber work \"Sweeney's Smithereens\" (2000).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6700483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6700483", "title": "Castelseprio (archaeological park)", "text": "Castelseprio (archaeological park)\n\nCastelseprio or Castel Seprio was the site of a Roman fort in antiquity, and a significant Lombard town in the early Middle Ages, before being destroyed and abandoned in 1287. It is today preserved as an archaeological park in the modern \"comune\" of Castelseprio, near the modern village of the same name. It is in the north of Italy, in the Province of Varese, about 50 km northwest of Milan.\n\nThe fame of Castelseprio lies in the Early Medieval frescoes contained in the small Church of \"Santa Maria foris portas\". These frescoes are of exceptional rarity and artistic significance. Hidden for centuries, the frescoes were only rediscovered in 1944. In 2011, the church - and the castrum with the Torba Tower - became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of a group of seven inscribed as Longobards in Italy, Places of Power (568-774 A.D.). In 2006, the Italian Ministry of Culture in a submission to UNESCO, said: \nCastelseprio originated as a Roman fort that commanded an important crossroad. During the early Middle Ages, the Lombards occupied the Roman fort, turning it into a fortified citadel or small town. At one point coins were minted there - a sign of its importance. The Church of \"Santa Maria foris portas\" (\"foris portas\" meaning \"outside the gates\" in Latin) which contains the famous frescoes, lay just outside the walls of the citadel. The early dedication of the church to Mary is an assumption; the first documented mention of a church dedicated to Mary in Castelseprio (which is assumed to be this one) comes from the 13th century.\n\nThe whole citadel was completely destroyed by Ottone Visconti, Archbishop of Milan, after he captured it in 1287, to prevent it being used again by his rivals. Investigations into the church, which began in 1934, finally uncovered the famous Byzantinesque frescoes below later plaster in 1944.\n\nThe whole area is now an archaeological zone containing the remains of the walls and of the much larger three-aisled 5th-century Basilica of San Giovanni Evangelista. There is also a baptistry of the 5th to 7th centuries dedicated to St. John the Baptist. This has two fonts, perhaps for the use of different Rites, and is octagonal with a small apse to the east. A third Church of San Paolo has a central hexagonal plan and was built between the 6th and 12th centuries. There are some ruins left from the castle. Nearby is a large tower, once used as a convent.\n\nWhen the Church of Santa Maria foris portas was investigated in 1944, it was found to contain, as well as later frescoes, a highly important and sophisticated cycle of fresco paintings showing very strong Byzantine influence. The dating of the frescoes and the origin of their painter or painters remain controversial, although the first half of the 9th century seems to be emerging as the most likely date. \n\nThe Byzantinesque frescoes are located around the curved wall of the apse, and the inward surface of the arch between the apse and the main body of the church. \nThe condition of the frescoes is variable; some parts are well-preserved whilst others are missing completely, or barely visible. Much of the painted area has been pitted to provide a key for the subsequent plastering-over (see the lower area in the middle of the Presentation scene).\n\nThe subjects of the missing or fragmentary scenes are a matter of some scholarly controversy with some writers proposing that these scenes made up a cycle on the \"Life of the Virgin\", and others one on the \"Life of Christ\"; these views are described below.\n\nThe frescoes are in three registers, the middle register being interrupted by three arched windows. They represent a cycle of the Nativity of Christ and may also have represented early aspects of the Life of Mary, or of Christ. The lowest register has a decorative frieze below which there are a few remains in the centre showing painted curtain railings and religious symbols. This register may not have contained figures. The upper and middle registers contain narrative paintings. The cycle may have been part of a larger scheme of decoration which once included the outer face of the arch and the other walls of the church. \nUpper register of narratives:\n\nThen, on the curved wall of the apse, reading left to right: \n\nMiddle Register \nOn the curved wall, reading from right to left :\nFragmentary remains of two frescoes which may have been:\nOn the two inner faces of the apsidal arch : \n\nChronological sequence\nThe alternative chronological sequences of the ten narrative scenes would run as follows:\n\nIn the Marian version the three missing scenes come at the start of the story, rather than the end. Neither sequence follows a consistent chronological sequence on the wall. Joseph's (first) dream and the trial by bitter water come chronologically between the Annunciation and the Visitation. The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple should, according to Leviticus have happened on the fortieth day after the birth. The timing of the visit of Magi is not mentioned in the Gospels, and apochryphal writings placed it between seven days and two years after the Nativity. The Eastern church, and by the Gothic period the Western church also, at least in art, placed it very soon after the birth, so that the Magi, like the shepherds, are included in Nativity scenes themselves. At this date, however, the Western church tended to place the arrival of the Magi later, though certainly before the Flight to Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents. Some departure from chronology to enable thematic or typological connections to be emphasised is a common feature of medieval picture cycles.\n\nSome scholars, notably P.D. Leveto, interpret the cycle as being \"Marian\", that is, part of the Life of Mary, rather than specifically representing those scenes associated with the Nativity. Evidence for this interpretation is the presence of the rarely depicted scene of the \"Trial by Bitter Water\". With this interpretation, the three missing narrative scenes would have had a different content, and the sequence itself would be differently ordered, moving from the left-hand side of the arch to the first two scenes of the lower register, through the top register and then to lower right-hand scenes and finishing with the Magi scene on the opposite side of the arch. In this proposed arrangement, the two scenes of the Birth and Presentation at the Temple of Mary are visually balanced with each other, whilst the Presentation and the Trial by water above it are concerned with Mary's virginity. Also balanced are the two scenes of offerings on either side of the arch wall; in both cases the figures are placed to make their offerings away from the empty arched space, to keep the visual attention focused within the apse.\n\nIt is thought by some scholars, including Leveto, that two different hands can be detected, but the origins of these artists are uncertain and subject to speculation.\n\nThe frescoes are sophisticated, expressive and confident. The artists adapt traditional compositional types to the particular site without strain or disproportion. Poses are natural and rhythmic, and the whole has \"a great ardor and conviction, an intense response to the human meaning of the subject\" (Schapiro). \nWhile some aspects of the frescoes, notably the iconography, are clearly Byzantine, others may draw on the Christian art of Syria or Egypt.\n\nThe frescoes also have significant aspects which relate most closely to the late antique art of Italy. Several of the buildings are successfully foreshortened, and the relationship between buildings and figures is more effectively managed than in most Byzantine painting. The painting is done with unusual freedom compared to most Byzantine work; it is this feature in particular which relates to much earlier works from the late antiquity such as paintings found in the catacombs of Rome.\n\nSome art historians see the style as coming from the tradition of Alexandria, from which no other painting on a similar scale remains. John Beckwith is somewhat less enthusiastic than some art historians, describing the frescos as \"wholly competent\" and worthy of comparison with 7th century works in Rome He believed the \"drapery folds ... a complex series of angular ridges emphasized by highlights ... make a decidedly metallic impression, and betray the copyist, who foreshadows in a disturbing way tenth-century mannerisms\".\n\nIn 1950, soon after the frescoes were first discovered, a poll of the scholars who attended a conference in Castelseprio showed a rough split between dates in the 7th and 10th century, although the extreme range of dates that have been suggested stretches from the 6th to the 14th century - an almost unprecedented range in medieval art history.\n\nSince that time, the range of possible dates has narrowed significantly. Radio-carbon dating of timber and thermoluminescent dating of roof tiles suggest that the church was built in the early to mid-ninth century. While providing a reasonably sound date for the church structure, this can only be \"terminus post quem\" for the frescoes, which may have been added later. However, the rough finish on the interior stonework leads many scholars to believe that the frescoes were added as part of the original building programme.\n\nA \"terminus ante quem\" was provided by the discovery of graffiti scratched into the fresco plaster recording a number of clerical appointments, the earliest of which is dated (by the name of the presiding Archbishop of Milan) to 948 at the latest. Many writers feel that a certain interval must have elapsed after the painting of the cycle before the clergy would have treated the paintings in this way.\nMany art historians have pointed to a relationship between the frescoes and two closely related manuscripts, namely the \"Joshua Roll\" (Vatican Library, Ms palatine gr. 431) and the \"Paris Psalter\" (Bibliothèque nationale de France Ms Grec. 139) . However, the dating of both manuscripts is likewise controversial. The art historians Kurt Weitzmann and Meyer Schapiro agreed that the artistic quality of the frescoes is superior to that of either manuscript.\n\nKurt Weitzmann preferred a date shortly before 945, and postulated a connection with a marriage between a Lombard princess and a Byzantine prince, which took place in 944. He favoured as the artist an unknown Constantinopolitan artist, trained in the same workshop as the artists of the two manuscripts, on a visit in connection with the marriage. Schapiro preferred a date between the 7th and 9th centuries, in 1957 settling on the 8th century.\n\nMost recent writers, relying on the analysis of the timber and roof tiles mentioned above, prefer the first half of the 9th century. Some writers believe the work may have been done by Greek refugees long settled in Italy, or by Italians trained by such artists. Others believe that artists fresh from the Byzantine world were responsible.\n\nAlmost every aspect of the frescoes, from the clothing to the treatment of the \"nimbus\" or halo around the infant Christ, has been analysed and compared to other works in great detail. Some examples are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The organisation grew from a need by a group of teenagers in Dublin's culturally bleak mid 20th Century. This was particularly the case if you happened to come from a working-class background, which was the case for most of the Grapevine founders, and is also the reason why the location of the centre was the unfashionable inner city's, North Side. The three main initiators of the project were Jackie Aherne, Anto Fahy and Sandy Fitzgerald.\n\nAs the 1970s progressed, the organisation became more culturally politicised, linking in with the radical community arts movement in the UK. This fruitful collaboration resulted in a wider world view and a move to work for a different perspective on culture, one that recognised difference and the rights of people with regard to cultural equality. Linking with similar projects that had emerged (notably City Workshop and Moving Theatre in Dublin and Neighbourhood Open Workshops in Belfast) in Ireland by the early 1980s, the community arts movement grew to be a force for change, resulting in new policies and perspectives that challenged the cultural orthodoxy. In 1984 the representative group CAFE (Creative Activity For Everyone) was formed, with Grapevine as a founding member.\n\nGrapevine's artistic programme grew alongside its philosophical awareness and this programme was diverse and multifaceted and took place both within the centre, around the suburbs of Dublin and throughout Ireland. Examples of this diversity can seen through its street theatre programme, directed by Thom McGinty (later to become the Diceman), hair cutting, street fashion design studio, audio art, street events, gigs and random acts of fun in public places. They had an innovative visual arts programme directed for a while by artist John Carson, later of Artangel in the UK. This included early shows by John Kindness amongst others including an exhibition of drawings from the survivors of Hiroshima, organised in association with a young U2.\n\nThe relationship with U2 continued into the centre's next phase when, in 1988, there was a name change from Grapevine Arts Centre to City Arts Centre when the organisation occupied a warehouse building on Moss Street near Tara Street Station, then the largest centre of its kind in Ireland. U2 provided fully equipped rehearsal spaces for young bands in the basement. Over this was a cafe and theatre space initially run by Declan Gorman and above that a gallery space initially run by Tommy Weir. Sandy Fitzgerald continued as Director through to 2001. The Arts Council never fully backed the centre favouring the highly regarded Project Arts Centre, despite the City Arts Centre clear leadership profile for community arts.\n\nThe Centre actually owned this building, having bought it in a then run-down area. However, the property become rather valuable. There was an opportunity to create a large civic project, when a partnership between City Quay School to the rear of the centre and a community hall adjacent to the centre were brought into a scheme for an innovative socio/cultural project at the entrance to the docklands, then at the beginning of its transformation. The scheme needed a piece of vacant land that linked all the properties but Dublin Dockland Development Authority rejected the idea, although both Dublin City Council and The Arts Council, plus all the local representatives supported the project. As a result, City Arts Centre became an anomaly within the dockland development. Sandy Fitzgerald stepped down as director of the centre in 2000, after 27 years. City Arts Centre, under the directorship of Declan McGonagle, decided to sell the building and to close down its on-site programmes and to engage in what it called the Civil Arts Inquiry, a two-year-long series of meetings, events and symposia aimed at formulating the future needs and future direction of community art. This process proved to be extremely expensive and drained a good deal of the initial capital raised through the sale of the building. However, a new centre was opened on Bachelor's Walk in 2010 with another name change, this time simply called CityArts.\n\nIn 2004 the book 'An Outburst of Frankness: Community Arts In Ireland - A Reader' was published by Tasc at New Island. This book, edited by Sandy Fitzgerald, goes into some detail about the history of community arts in Ireland, backed up by essays on the theory and practice of this movement.\n\nThroughout the 25-year tenure of City Arts there were a number of varied and quite popular events, some of which succeeded in grabbing press and political attention.\n\n1978/79 - Took an active part in the anti-nuclear protests at this time, contributing to the Carnsore Point anti-nuclear festivals with children's theatre, music, dance and public 'happenings'. Also organised an anti-nuclear exhibition and public debates in their Dublin centre.\n\n1982 - Took part and photographed the nuclear disarmament march.\n\n1985 - Grapevine Arts Centre reforms as City Arts Centre.\n\n1989 - Street Carnival.\n\nOfficial opening of Moss Street City Arts Building. Charles Haughey attends and is greeted by Una Sealy.\n\n1990 - City Quay School \n\n1995 - \"Another parade which involved many local children was the South Docks Festival Parade followed by the Fair in the Square in July. Also in the South Docks Festival (organised by City Arts Centre and St Andrews Resource Centre) was Childrens Day held in and around Pearse Square.\" \n\n"}

With the advent of the internet, a similar process has been set up by a number of businesses offering small-scale competitions for mainly domestic projects. Like an architectural competition, contributors must register but their designs are judged anonymously, and only the winning design is paid a fee.\n\nAn unprecedented business model for crowdsourcing architectural design was launched by Cambridge, MA based high-tech company Arcbazar in 2010. It builds on traditional architectural competitions and provides an online competition platform for small-to-medium scale architecture, landscape, interior design and remodeling projects; and, builds on the triumvirate of clients, designers and contractors. It connects clients with designers through architectural competitions, and links contractors with construction projects.\n\nThere are also a growing number of architectural crowdsourcing platforms that direct their call openly to members of the public, facilitating mass-participation and self-organized collaboration to build upon and improve architectural design solutions. This follows from Jeff Howe's original definition of the term crowdsourcing, which emphasises the idea of an open call to an undefined group of people, because \"the person who you think would be best qualified to perform the job, isn't always the best person to do it.\"\n\nCrowdsourcing architecture has been heavily criticized by professional architects and architectural guilds. Dwell, America's leading home and architecture magazine, called the launch of arcbazar \"the worst thing to happen to architecture since the internet started.\" This statement caused many heated debates among architectural bloggers worldwide. The Architects' Journal, Great Britain's leading professional architecture magazine, wrote: \"Architecture crowd-sourcing website criticized: Architects have slammed a threatening new crowd-sourcing website in the US which promises to reduce clients' costs.\"\n\n"}

It is usually cooked with an outer coating of bread and sautéed in butter.\n\nThe word \"crépine\" is French for \"pig's caul\".\nThe name originated in the second half of the 13th century as \"a small ornamental crêpe\", being derived from the word crêpe. \nIn cookbooks, the term crépinette is sometimes used to indicate the contents of the crépinette only. This is the same as other countries where we find crépinette, sometimes spelled crepinette, to describe both the contents and the dish itself.\n\nA crépinette is a mixture of minced meat stuffed in intestinal membrane.\nAlthough it has a different casing than sausage, it is often described as a sausage dish. It is also described as a round and flat dish in a number of French dictionaries.\nThe crépinette distinguishes itself by being balled meat wrapped in thin slices of meat.\n\nThe stuffing of the crépinette can be made of ground pork, chicken fillets, finely ground game birds (partridge, woodcock, pigeon), and also lamb sweetbreads, calf kidneys, fillets of lark or rabbit, and sliced eel.

Production and sales of devotional articles have become a widespread industry in the vicinity of various religious sites all over the world.\n\nDevotional articles have a long history; in Christianity they have been mentioned in historical works such as those related to Paul the Apostle and in older religions they have been traced as far back as the times of ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia. International law defines \"devotional articles\" as including \"the Bible, the Koran, prayer and service books, hymnals, ritual articles, sacramental wine, crucifixes and rosaries\". Such items may be natural and hardly processed (such as earth from the Holy Land), but majority of modern devotional articles are mass-produced (strips of paper with prayers, pictures of holy figures, prayer books, etc.) Such items are usually seen as having little artistic value, as their primary function is not decorative but spiritual.\n\nAmerican sociologist Charles H. Lippy observed that such articles are \"means of access to the supernatural\", and are criticized by some as superstition.

{"id": "1810063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810063", "title": "Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons", "text": "Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons\n\nSeveral different editions of the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (\"D&D\") fantasy role-playing game have been produced since 1974. The current publisher of \"D&D\", Wizards of the Coast, produces new materials only for the most current edition of the game. Many \"D&D\" fans, however, continue to play older versions of the game and some third-party companies continue to publish materials compatible with these older editions.\n\nAfter the original edition of \"D&D\" was introduced in 1974, the game was split into two branches in 1977: the rules-light system of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and the more complex, rules-heavy system of \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" (\"AD&D\"). The standard game was eventually expanded into a series of five box sets by the mid-1980s before being compiled and slightly revised in 1991 as the \"Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia\". Meanwhile, the 2nd edition of \"AD&D\" was published in 1989. In 2000, the 3rd edition, called simply \"Dungeons & Dragons\", debuted. The 4th edition was published in 2008. The 5th edition was released in 2014.\n\nThe original \"D&D\" was published as a box set in 1974 and featured only a handful of the elements for which the game is known today: just three character classes (fighting-man, magic-user, and cleric); four races (human, dwarf, elf, and hobbit); only a few monsters; only three alignments (lawful, neutral, and chaotic). The rules assumed that players owned and played the miniatures wargame \"Chainmail\" and used its measurement and combat systems. An optional combat system was included within the rules that later developed into the sole combat system of later versions of the game. In addition, the rules presumed ownership of \"Outdoor Survival\", a board game by then-unaffiliated company Avalon Hill for outdoor exploration and adventure. \"D&D\" was a radically new gaming concept at the time, and it was difficult for players without prior tabletop wargaming experience to grasp the vague rules. The release of the \"Greyhawk\" supplement removed the game's dependency on the \"Chainmail\" rules, and made it much easier for new, non-wargaming players to grasp the concepts of play. It also inadvertently aided the growth of competing game publishers, since just about anyone who grasped the concepts behind the game could write smoother and easier to use rules systems and sell them to the growing \"D&D\" fanbase (\"Tunnels & Trolls\" being the first such).\n\nSupplements such as \"Greyhawk\", \"Blackmoor\", \"Eldritch Wizardry\" and \"Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes\", published over the next two years, greatly expanded the rules, character classes, monsters and spells. For example, the original \"Greyhawk\" supplement introduced the thief class, and weapon damage varying by weapon (as opposed to character class). In addition, many additions and options were published in the magazines \"The Strategic Review\" and its successor, \"The Dragon\".\n\nAn updated version of \"D&D\" was released between 1977 and 1979 as Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (\"AD&D\"). The game rules were reorganized and re-codified across three hardcover rulebooks, compiled by Gary Gygax, incorporating the original \"D&D\" rules and many additions and revisions from supplements and magazine articles. The three core rulebooks were the \"Monster Manual\" (1977), the \"Player's Handbook\" (1978), and the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" (1979). Major additions included classes from supplements like assassin, druid, monk, paladin, and thief, while bard, illusionist and ranger, which had previously only appeared in magazine articles, were added to the core rulebooks.\n\nLater supplements for \"AD&D\" included \"Deities & Demigods\" (1980), \"Fiend Folio\" (another book of monsters produced semi-autonomously in the UK - 1981), \"Monster Manual II\" (1983), \"Oriental Adventures\" and \"Unearthed Arcana\" (1985), the latter of which mostly compiled material previously published in \"Dragon\" magazine, and others.\n\nWhile \"AD&D\" was still in the works, TSR was approached by an outside writer and \"D&D\" enthusiast, John Eric Holmes, who offered to re-edit and rewrite the original rules into an introductory version of \"D&D\". Although TSR was focused on \"AD&D\" at the time, the project was seen as a profitable enterprise and a way to direct new players to anticipate the release of the \"AD&D\" game. It was published in July 1977 as the \"Basic Set\", collecting together and organizing the rules from the original \"D&D\" boxed set and \"Greyhawk\" supplement into a single booklet, which covered character levels 1 through 3, and included dice and a beginner's module. The booklet featured a blue cover with artwork by David C. Sutherland III. The \"blue booklet\" explained the game's concepts and method of play in terms that made it accessible to new players not familiar with tabletop miniatures wargaming. Unusual features of this version included an alignment system of five alignments as opposed to the three or nine alignments of the other versions. This \"Basic Set\" was very popular and allowed many to discover and experience the \"D&D\" game for the first time. Although the \"Basic Set\" is not fully compatible with \"AD&D\", as some rules were simplified to make the game easier for new players to learn, players were expected to continue play beyond third level by moving on to the \"AD&D\" version.\n\nOnce \"AD&D\" had been released, the \"Basic Set\" saw a major revision in 1981 by Tom Moldvay, which was immediately followed by the release of an \"Expert Set\" written by David Cook, to accompany the \"Basic Set\", extending it to levels 4 through 14, for players who preferred the simplified introductory ruleset. With this revision, the \"Basic\" rules became their own game, distinct both from original \"D&D\" and \"AD&D\". The revised \"Basic\" rules can be distinguished from the original ones by cover colors: the \"Basic\" booklet had a red cover, and the \"Expert\" booklet a blue one.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1985 this system was revised and expanded by Frank Mentzer as a series of five boxed sets, including the \"Basic Rules\" (red cover), \"Expert Rules\" (blue), \"Companion Rules\" (green, supporting levels 15 through 25), \"Master Rules\" (black, supporting levels 26 through 36), and \"Immortals Rules\" (gold, supporting Immortals—characters who had transcended levels).\n\nThis version was compiled and slightly revised by Aaron Allston in 1991 as the \"Rules Cyclopedia\", a hardback book which included all the sets except \"Immortals Rules\" which was discontinued and replaced with the \"Wrath of the Immortals\" boxed set accessory. While the \"Rules Cyclopedia\" included all information required to begin the game, there was a revised introductory boxed set, named \"The New Easy-to-Master Dungeons & Dragons Game\", nicknamed \"the black box\". A final repackaging of the introductory set, titled \"The Classic Dungeons & Dragons Game\" was released in 1994. By the end of 1995, TSR ended its support for the line.\n\nIn 1987, a small team of designers at TSR led by David \"Zeb\" Cook began work on the second edition of the \"AD&D\" game, which would take two years to complete. In 1989, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition was published, featuring new rules and characters.\n\nBy the end of its first decade, \"AD&D\" had expanded to several rulebooks, including three collections of monsters (\"Monster Manual\", \"Monster Manual II\", \"Fiend Folio\"), and two books governing character skills in wilderness and underground settings. Gygax had already planned a second edition for the game, which would also have been an update of the rules, incorporating the material from \"Unearthed Arcana\", \"Oriental Adventures\", and numerous new innovations from \"Dragon\" magazine in the \"Player's Handbook\" and \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" and would have consolidated the \"Monster Manual\", \"Monster Manual II\" and \"Fiend Folio\" into one volume. Initially, the 2nd edition was planned to consolidate the game, but more changes were made during development, while still aiming at backwards compatibility with 1st edition.\n\nThe release of \"AD&D 2nd Edition\" corresponded with important policy changes at TSR. An effort was made to remove aspects of the game which had attracted negative publicity, most notably the removal of all mention of demons and devils, although equivalent fiendish monsters were included, renamed tanar'ri and baatezu, respectively. Moving away from the moral ambiguity of the 1st edition \"AD&D\", the TSR staff eliminated character classes and races like the assassin and the half-orc, and stressed heroic roleplaying and player teamwork. The target age of the game was also lowered, with most 2nd edition products being aimed primarily at teenagers.\n\nThe game was again published as three core rulebooks which incorporated the expansions and revisions which had been published in various supplements over the previous decade. However, the \"Monster Manual\" was replaced by the \"Monstrous Compendium\", a loose-leaf binder in which every monster is given a full page of information. It was the intention that packs of new monsters (often setting-specific) could be purchased and added to the binder without the expense or inconvenience of a separate book, allowing the book to be updated and customized as needed. This format proved highly susceptibile to wear and tear, however, and presented difficulties in keeping alphabetic order when pages had been printed with monsters on each side. Subsequently, the loose leaf formatting was abandoned and the \"Compendium\" as a core book was replaced by single-volume hardcover \"Monstrous Manual\" in 1993, collecting popular monsters from the \"Compendium\". The edition also greatly increases the power of dragons to counter the impression of relative weakness of the game's titular monster.\n\nNumerous mechanical changes were made to the game. The combat system was modified. The minimum number required to hit a target uses a mathematical formula in which the defender's armor class (AC) is subtracted from the attacker's THAC0 (\"To Hit Armor Class '0'\") number, a simplification of 1st edition's attack matrix tables that had appeared as an optional rule in the 1st edition \"DMG\". Distances are based on in-game units (feet) rather than miniatures-board ones (inches). Critical hits are offered as optional rules.\n\nCharacter creation is modified in many ways. Demi-human races are given higher level maximums to increase their long-term playability, though they are still restricted in terms of character class flexibility. Character classes are organized into four groups: warrior (fighter, paladin, ranger), wizard (mage, specialist wizard), priest (cleric, druid), and rogue (thief, bard). Assassins and monks were removed from the game as character classes, \"magic-users\" are renamed \"mages\", illusionists are made into a subtype of the wizard class, along with new classes specializing in the other schools of magic. Proficiencies are officially supported in the \"Player's Handbook\" and many supplements, rather than being an optional add-on. Psionics are no longer included in the \"Player's Handbook\", though they later appeared in their own supplement.\n\nIn 1995, TSR re-released the core rulebooks for 2nd Edition with new covers, art, and page layouts. These releases were followed shortly by a series of volumes labelled \"Player's Option\", allowing for alternate rules systems and character options, as well as a \"Dungeon Master Option\" for high-level campaigns. They consisted of:\n\nSome of the optional rules included the introduction of a point-based system to allow players to pick and choose parts of classes to make their own class, and a more tactical combat system including attacks of opportunity.\n\nA major revision of the \"AD&D\" rules was released in 2000. As the \"Basic\" game had been discontinued some years earlier, and the more straightforward title was more marketable, the word \"advanced\" was dropped and the new edition was named just \"Dungeons & Dragons\", but still officially referred to as 3rd edition (or \"3E\" for short). It is the basis of a broader role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the d20 System.\n\nMonte Cook, Jonathan Tweet, and Skip Williams all contributed to the 3rd edition \"Player's Handbook\", \"Dungeon Master's Guide\", and \"Monster Manual\", and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions.\n\nThe d20 system uses a more unified mechanic than earlier editions, resolving nearly all actions with a d20 die roll plus appropriate modifiers. Modifiers based on ability scores follow a standardized formula. Saving throws are reduced from five categories based on forms of attack to three based on type of defense.\n\nThe combat system is greatly expanded, adopting into the core system most of the optional movement and combat system of the 2nd edition \"Players Option: Combat and Tactics\" book. Third edition combat allows for a grid system, encouraging highly tactical gameplay and facilitating the use of miniatures.\n\nNew character options were introduced. The new sorcerer class was introduced. The thief is renamed rogue, a term that 2nd edition uses to classify both the thief and bard classes, and introduces prestige classes, which characters can only enter at higher character levels, and only if they meet certain character-design prerequisites or fulfill certain in-game goals. Later products included additional and supplementary rules subsystems such as \"epic-level\" options for characters above 20th level, as well as a heavily revised treatment of psionics.\n\n3rd edition removes previous editions' restrictions on class and race combinations that were intended to track the preferences of the race, and on the level advancement of non-human characters. Skills and the new system of feats are introduced replacing non-weapon proficiencies, to allow players to further customize their characters.\n\nThe d20 System is presented under the Open Game License, which makes it an open source system for which authors can write new games and game supplements without the need to develop a unique rules system and, more importantly, without the need for direct approval from Wizards of the Coast. This makes it easier to market D&D-compatible content under a broadly recognizable commercial license.\n\nIn July 2003, a revised version of the 3rd edition \"D&D\" rules (termed \"v. 3.5\") was released that incorporated numerous small rule changes, as well as expanding the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" and \"Monster Manual\". This revision was intentionally a small one focusing on addressing common complaints about certain aspects of gameplay, hence the \"half edition\" version number. The basic rules are fundamentally the same, and many monsters and items are compatible (or even unchanged) between those editions. New spells are added, and numerous changes are made to existing spells, while some spells are removed from the updated \"Player's Handbook\". New feats are added and numerous changes are made to existing feats, while several skills are renamed or merged with other skills.\n\nOn August 15, 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced the development of \"D&D\" 4th edition. In December 2007, the book \"\", the first preview of 4th Edition, was released. This was followed by a second book in January 2008 named \"\". The \"Player's Handbook\", \"Monster Manual\", and \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" were released in June 2008.\n\nSlashdot reported anger from some players and retailers due to the financial investment in v3.5 and the relatively brief period of time that it had been in publication. Although many players chose to continue playing older editions, or other games such as \"Pathfinder\", the initial print run of the 4th edition sold out during preorders, and Wizards of the Coast announced a second print run prior to the game's official release.\n\nUnlike previous editions with just three core rulebooks, 4th edition core rules include multiple volumes of the \"Player's Handbook\", \"Dungeon Master's Guide\", and \"Monster Manual\" that were released yearly, with each new book becoming a part of the core. In the first \"Player's Handbook\", the warlock and warlord are included, while the barbarian, bard, druid, sorcerer and monk are not present. Of those classes, the first four were included in \"Player's Handbook 2\", while the monk class appears in \"Player's Handbook 3\".\n\nMechanically, 4th edition saw a major overhaul of the game’s systems. Changes in spells and other per-encounter resourcing, giving all classes a similar number of at-will, per-encounter and per-day \"powers\". Powers have a wide range of effects including inflicting status effects, creating zones, and forced movement, making combat very tactical for all classes but essentially requiring use of miniatures, reinforced by the use of squares to express distances. Attack rolls, skill checks and defense values all get a bonus equal to one-half level, rounded down, rather than increasing at different rates depending on class or skill point investment. Each skill is either trained (providing a fixed bonus on skill checks, and sometimes allowing more exotic uses for the skills) or untrained, but in either case all characters also receive a bonus to all skill rolls based on level. A system of “healing surges” and short and long rests are introduced to act as resource management.\n\nThe system of prestige classes is replaced. Characters at 11th level choose a \"paragon path\", a specialty based on their class, which defines some of their new powers through 20th level. At level 21, an \"epic destiny\" is chosen in a similar manner., the paragon path and the epic destiny replace the prestige class system of 3rd edition. Core rules extend to level 30 rather than level 20, bringing \"epic level\" play back into the core rules.\n\nThis product line debuted in September 2010 and consisted of ten products intended to lower the barrier of entry into the game. \"Essentials\" uses the \"D&D\" 4th edition rule set and provides simple player character options intended for first-time players. Many of the new player character options emulated features from previous editions, such as schools of magic for the wizard class, as to appeal to older players who had not adopted 4th edition.\n\nThe \"Essentials\" line contained revisions to the ruleset compiled over the prior two years, in the form of the \"Rules Compendium\", which condensed rules and errata into one volume, while also updating the rules with newly introduced changes. The player books \"Heroes of the Fallen Lands\" and \"Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms\" contained rules for creating characters, as well as new builds for each class described in the books. Other \"Essentials\" releases included a \"Dungeon Master's Kit\" and \"Monster Vault\", each also containing accessories.\n\nIn January 2012, Wizards of the Coast announced that a new edition of the game, at the time referred to as \"D&D Next\", was under development. In direct contrast to the previous editions of the game, \"D&D Next\" was developed partly via a public open playtest. An early build of the new edition debuted at the 2012 \"Dungeons & Dragons Experience\" event to about 500 fans. Public playtesting began on May 24, 2012, with the final playtest packet released on September 20, 2013.\n\nThe 5th edition's \"Basic Rules\", a free PDF containing complete rules for play and a subset of the player and DM content from the core rulebooks, was released on July 3, 2014. The \"Starter Set\" was released on July 15, featuring a set of pre-generated characters, a set of instructions for basic play, and the adventure module \"Lost Mine of Phandelver\". The \"Player's Handbook\" was released on August 19, 2014. The fifth edition \"Monster Manual\" was released on September 30, 2014. The \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" was released on December 9, 2014. The edition returns to having only three core rule books, with the \"Player’s Handbook\" containing most major races and classes.\n\nMechanically, 5th edition draws heavily on prior editions, while introducing some new mechanics intended to simplify and streamline play. Actions are now more dependent on checks made with the six core abilities with skills taking a more supportive role.\n\nSkills, weapons, items, saving throws and other things that characters are trained in now all use a single proficiency bonus that increases as character level increases. Multiple defense values have been removed, returning to a single defense value of armor class and using more traditional saving throws. Saving throws are reworked to be situational checks based on the six core abilities instead of generic d20 rolls. Feats are now optional features that can be taken instead of ability score increases and are reworked to be occasional major upgrades instead of frequent minor upgrades.\n\nThe \"advantage/disadvantage\" mechanic was introduced, streamlining conditional and situational modifiers to a simpler mechanic: rolling two d20s for a situation and taking the higher of the two for \"advantage\" and the lower of the two for \"disadvantage\" and canceling each other out when both apply.\n\nThe power system of 4th edition was replaced with more traditional class features that are gained as characters level. Each spell-casting class uses a unique system to cast their spells, with wizards and clerics using a slightly modified version of the spell preparation system of previous editions. Healing Surges are replaced by Hit Dice, requiring a character to roll a hit die during a short rest instead of healing a flat rate of hit points.\n\nKenzer & Company received permission from Wizards of the Coast to produce a parody version of 1st and 2nd edition \"AD&D\". They published the humorously numbered \"HackMaster\" 4th edition from 2001 until they lost their license. The game was well received and won the Origins Award for \"Game of the Year 2001\". A new edition of \"Hackmaster\" was released in 2011 that no longer uses \"AD&D\" mechanics as Kenzer & Company's license expired. \n\nThe publication of the System Reference Document (SRD) for 3rd edition under the Open Game License (OGL) allowed other companies to use the rules to create their own variants of \"Dungeons & Dragons\", providing that they did not use anything Wizards of the Coast considered trade dress or signature content, known as \"product identity\" under the terms of the OGL.\n\n\"Castles & Crusades\", published in 2004 by Troll Lord Games, is an early example of the OGL and SRD being used to recreate the experience of older editions.\n\n\"Retro-clones\" are variants created to even more closely simulate previous editions, part of a movement known as the Old School Revival. Prominent retro-clones include \"Labyrinth Lord\", \"OSRIC\", and \"Swords & Wizardry\". \n\nThe \"Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\" was first published in 2009 by Paizo Publishing. It is intended to be backward-compatible with \"D&D\" v. 3.5 while adjusting some rules balance, and has been nicknamed \"v. 3.75\" by some fans. Pathfinder has been one of the best-selling role playing games in the industry.\n\n\"13th Age\" is a game designed by Jonathan Tweet, a lead designer of the 3rd Edition, and Rob Heinsoo, a lead designer of 4th Edition, and published by Pelgrane Press in 2013.\n\nThe \"D&D\" franchise has been translated and published in several languages around the world.\n\nA particular challenge has been the word dungeon, which in standard English means a single prison cell or oubliette originally located under a keep. Some languages, like Spanish, Italian, Finnish, and Portuguese, didn't translate the title of the game and kept it as it is in English: \"Dungeons & Dragons\". In Spanish-speaking countries, the 1983 animated series was translated in Hispanic America as \"Calabozos y Dragones\" and in Spain as \"Dragones y Mazmorras\" (\"calabozo\" and \"mazmorra\" have in all Spanish-speaking countries the same meaning: a dungeon). In Brazil, the same animated series was translated as \"Caverna do Dragão\" (\"Dragon's Cave\"). This still brings great confusion amongst Spanish-speaking and Brazilian gamers about the name of the game, since all Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese translations of the game kept the original English title. In gaming jargon, however, a dungeon is not a single holding cell but rather a network of underground passages or subterranea to be explored, such as a cave, ruins or catacombs. Some translations conveyed this meaning well, e.g. Chinese \"龙与地下城\" (\"Dragons and Underground Castles\", or \"Dragons and Underground Cities\"). Some translations used a false friend of \"dungeon\", even if it changed the meaning of the title, such as the French \"Donjons et dragons\" (\"Keeps and Dragons\"). In Hebrew, the game was published as \"מבוכים ודרקונים\" (\"Labyrinths and Dragons\"). Additionally, some translations adopted the English word \"dungeon\" as a game term, leaving it untranslated in the text as well.\n\n\n"}

Putnam, published in seven volumes during the period 1886 to 1900, and republished as a set of uniform volumes in 1909. Additionally an eighth volume was published, as a summary of the seven volumes, titled, \"Essentials of Esthetics\". A volume of excerpts of his seven books, edited by the classical scholar Marion Mills Miller, was also published by Putnam in 1920. (see publication list below)\n\nRaymond was an art theorist who created the first comprehensive and systematic theory of the arts. The New York Times said \"In a spirit at once scientific and that of the true artist, he pierces through the manifestations of art to their sources, and shows the relations, intimate and essential, between painting, sculpture, poetry, music, and architecture.\" \n\nHe was rare among art theorists of the time (and since), to use psychology and physiology and biological factors to ground his art theory, and to use detailed discussions of specific art works to validate his views.\n\nHis work is neglected, although some scholars say his system deserves resurrection.\n\nHis basic approach is as stated in his summary one-volume book \"Essentials of Esthetics\":\n\"The phenomena of the arts of the highest class have been traced [in this book] to their sources in material nature and in the human mind; the different arts have been shown to be developed by exactly similar methods; and these methods have been shown to characterize the entire work of artistic imagination, from the formulation of psychical concepts to that of their most physical expressions in rhythm, proportion and harmony.\"\n\nHe was also a vocal advocate of a scientific and rational Christianity. He seemed to be following in Aquinas’ footsteps in believing he could rationalize religious belief with science.\n\nHe was also a widely published poet during the latter part of the 19th century, though with no lasting celebrity.\n\nHe wrote works on oratory (i.e., rhetoric), early in life, since he a professor of oratory; and later in life after retiring from his professorships, he wrote a book on ethics and natural law.\n\nThree of his books (the last two in the esthetic book list above, and one on ethics) are available in full digital text form at subscriber website www.questia.com.

She is played by actress Kali Rocha.\n\nHalfrek is a long-time associate and sometime friend of Anya, who knew her from her days as a vengeance demon. The two had worked together in the past, notably during the Russian Revolution of 1905. However, Halfrek's \"raison d'etre\" differed from Anya's. Whereas Anya was an avenger of scorned women, Halfrek's \"thing\" (as Anya put it) is to perform vengeance for children who have been wronged by their parents or guardians. Anya attributes this to \"daddy issues\". Even after Anya ceases to be a vengeance demon, she continues her friendship with Halfrek. Like Anyanka used the name Anya when masquerading as human, Halfrek's mortal persona goes by the name Hallie.\n\nIn her second appearance in season 6, Halfrek poses as a guidance counselor and coaxes Dawn into making a wish. Feeling that no one wants to spend time with her, Dawn wishes that people would never leave; Halfrek therefore casts a spell that prevents anyone from leaving the Summers residence. The crisis ends when Halfrek herself is caught in the spell and has to break it. Halfrek also appears as a bridesmaid at the failed wedding of Anya and Xander. Early in season 7, Halfrek attempts to coax Anya back into vengeance, but Anya has spent too long as a mortal to return to her old life; while she was initially successful in her return to demonhood, she subsequently regrets the deaths she has caused. D'Hoffryn asks Anya what she wants, and she says that she wants to reverse the vengeance she had done. D'Hoffryn grants her wish, telling her that it'll require the sacrifice of a vengeance demon's body and soul. Believing she is about to die, Anya is resigned to her fate—only to watch helplessly as D'Hoffryn summons her friend Halfrek and incinerates her in front of Anya.\n\nIn the season 5 episode \"Fool For Love\", Halfrek uses the persona of Cecily while on a job to kill all the guests at a party Spike is attending. Cecily, being the upper-class object of the then-human William's affections in Victorian England circa 1880 spurns William's advances, saying he is \"beneath her\", and upsetting him greatly. This sets in motion the events that lead William to accept comfort from Drusilla, and become a vampire. (Cecily's surname was implied to be \"Underwood\" in the episode \"Lies My Parents Told Me\", but stated to be \"Addams\" in the script and credits of \"Fool for Love\" and the non-canon tie-in novel \"These Our Actors\".)\n\nIn the season 6 episode \"Older and Far Away\", Halfrek recognizes Spike and calls him by his human name, William. Spike also recognizes Halfrek, but when asked to explain this they both sheepishly deny being acquainted. This implies that Halfrek had previously been Cecily. However, Halfrek and Anya witnessed the Crimean War (circa 1853) which is mentioned in \"Lessons\" and shown in \"Selfless\". The timing of this event would indicate that Halfrek existed as a demon at least three decades prior to the adoption of the youthful human form in Cecily. Joss Whedon and Kali Rocha have both stated that, in their minds at least, Halfrek and Cecily were indeed the same entity. \n\nHalfrek later appeared in the comic \"\", which established that she was 'on a job' at the time that William fell for Cecily. She seems to have had at least some pity for William in spite of her rejection of him, as the night he became a vampire, she caused the deaths of the rude party-goers who had laughed at his poetry.\n\nContinuity-wise, the comic story takes place in Buffy Season 6, and assumes that an ensouled Spike briefly left Sunnydale and visited LA.\n\n"}

{"id": "221185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221185", "title": "Letterist International", "text": "Letterist International\n\nThe Letterist International (LI) was a Paris-based collective of radical artists and theorists between 1952 and 1957. It was created by Guy Debord as a from Isidore Isou's Letterist group. The group went on to join others in forming the Situationist International, taking some key techniques and ideas with it.\n\nThe spelling 'Lettrist' is also common in English, but 'Letterist' was the form the French group (\"Internationale Lettriste\") themselves preferred, and used in their 1955 sticker: 'If you believe you have genius, or if you think you have only a brilliant intelligence, write the letterist internationale.' With regard to that second word, however, most scholars prefer 'International' to 'Internationale'. Such authors and translators as Donald Nicholson-Smith, Simon Ford, Sadie Plant and Andrew Hussey all agree on the 'Letterist International' spelling.\n\nThe group was a motley assortment of novelists, sound poets, painters, film-makers, revolutionaries, bohemians, alcoholics, petty criminals, lunatics, under-age girls and self-proclaimed failures. In the Summer of 1953, their average age was a mere twenty years old, rising to twenty nine and a half in 1957. In their blend of intellectualism, protest and hedonism—though differing in other ways, for instance in their total rejection of spirituality—they might be viewed as French counterparts of the American Beat Generation, particularly in the form it took during exactly the same period, i.e. before anyone from either group achieved any real fame, and were still having the adventures that would inform their later works and ideas.\n\nThe LI was the first breakaway faction from Isidore Isou's Letterists. (They would be followed in turn by the Ultra-Letterists). The schism developed when the 'left-wing' of the Letterist group disrupted a Charlie Chaplin press conference for \"Limelight\" at the Hôtel Ritz Paris in October 1952. They distributed a polemic entitled \"No More Flat Feet\", which concluded: \"The footlights have melted the make-up of the supposedly brilliant mime. All we can see now is a lugubrious and mercenary old man. Go home Mister Chaplin.\" Isou was keen to distance himself from his younger acolytes' tract. His own attitude was that Chaplin deserved respect as one of the great creators of the cinematic art. The breakaway group felt that he was no longer relevant, and they turned Isou's own words back against him: \"We appreciated the importance of Chaplin's work \"in its own time\", but we know that today novelty lies elsewhere, and 'truths which no longer entertain become lies' (Isou).\" As they proceeded to explain, \"the most urgent exercise of liberty is the destruction of idols\".\n\nAlthough the LI had in fact already been covertly formed by Guy Debord and Gil J. Wolman in June 1952, even before the Chaplin intervention and the public split from Isou, it was not formally established until 7 December 1952. The four signatories of the Chaplin tract (Debord and Wolman, together with Jean-Louis Brau and Serge Berna) agreed on a constitution for the group during a visit to Aubervilliers (where Brau's father lived). Anyone collaborating with 'Isouian activities', they declared, would be automatically excluded, even if this was being done in defence of the LI. 'It is in the transcendence of arts that everything has yet to be done.' The official base of the group was at 32, Rue de la Montagne-Sainte-Geneviéve, Paris, subsequently to become the official base of the Situationist International (but invariably referred to by both groups as \"Rue de la Montagne-Geneviéve\", signalling their disdain for religion). This was in fact the address of a bar, Tonneau d'Or, and indeed most of their time was spent either drinking in a number of bars in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, principally at Chez Moineau on the Rue du Four, or else simply walking the streets.\n\nThere was a serious purpose behind their ambulation. They developed the dérive, or drift, where they would wander like clouds through the urban environment for hours or sometimes even days on end. During their wanderings in the Summer of 1953, an \"illiterate Kabyle\" suggested to them the term \"Psychogeography\", to designate what they saw as a pattern of emotive force-fields that would permeate a city. The dérive would enable them to map out these forces, and these results could then be used as a basis upon which to build a system of unitary urbanism. Among their most important texts on these matters were Debord's \"Theory of the Dérive\" (published in the Belgian surrealist magazine \"Les Lèvres Nues\", no. 9, November 1956), and Ivan Chtcheglov's \"Formulary for a New Urbanism\" (written October 1953, but not published until June 1958 in the first issue of the journal \"Internationale Situationniste\"). In the latter, Chtcheglov advocated a new city where, as he wrote, \"each person will live in his own personal 'cathedral'. There will be rooms that produce dreams better than drugs, and houses where it will be impossible to do anything but love.\" He declared, \"The Hacienda must be built\", a remark which would later inspire the name of the famous Manchester night-club. In \"Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography\" (\"Les Lèvres Nues\", no. 6, September 1955), Debord described a colleague's drift through the Harz region of Germany, blindly following a map of London. This is still a favourite methodology amongst psychogeographers. They produced a broad range of proposals: the abolition of museums and the placing of art in bars, keeping the Metro open all night, opening the roofs of Paris like pavements with escalators to help gain access.\n\nAnother important notion developed by the LI, was that of détournement, a technique of reutilising plagiarised material (literary, artistic, cinematic, etc.) for a new and usually radical purpose. The defining LI text here was the 1956 \"A User's Guide to Détournement\", by Debord and Wolman, from \"Les Lèvres Nues\" no. 8. They argued: \"In truth, it is necessary to do away with the whole notion of personal property in this area. The emergence of new demands renders earlier 'great works' obsolete. They become obstacles, bad habits. It is not a question of whether we like them or not. We must pass them by.\" These techniques were subsequently used extensively by the Situationists. In addition, such characteristically situationist concepts as the construction of situations and the supersession of art were first developed by the LI.\n\nIn addition to the central Parisian group, an Algerian section of the LI was established in April 1953 by Hadj Mohamed Dahou, Cheik Ben Dhine and Ait Diafer. Based at Orléansville ('the most letterist city in the world' according to \"Potlatch\" no. 12), they were hit hard by an earthquake there on 9 September 1954, although initial reports that most of them had been killed turned out to be unfounded (\"Potlatch\" no. 13). A Swiss section was also established in late 1954, but were almost immediately excluded (\"Potlatch\" no. 15).\n\nIn September 1956, Wolman represented the LI at the World Congress of Artists in Alba, Italy. This conference had been organised by Asger Jorn and Pinot-Gallizio of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus (IMIB), and important links between the two groups were consolidated. Wolman himself was excluded from the LI shortly afterwards, but the remaining members, Debord and Michèle Bernstein, subsequently visited Cosio d'Arroscia where, on 28 July 1957, the LI officially fused with the IMIB and the London Psychogeographical Association to form the Situationist International.\n\nBesides the Charlie Chaplin protest, some of the more noteworthy/startling activities of the LI include:\n\n\nAlthough pre-dating the formation of the LI (but directly involving Serge Berna, and inspiring the others), one might also mention:\n\n\nAn extract from a letter of Gil Wolman to Jean-Louis Brau, of 20 July 1953, gives a clear impression of what the group and their associates tended to get up to from day to day:\n\nI am back! ... Where were things when you left? Joël [Berlé] has been out for a long time, on probation. Jean-Michel [Mension] and Fred [Auguste Hommel] are now free, too (for stealing from parked cars—and under the influence, naturally). Little Eliane [Papaï] got out of police custody last week after a dramatic arrest in a maid's room somewhere in Vincennes with Joël and Jean-Michel; they were drunk, needless to say, and refused to open up to the police, who left and came back with reinforcements. In the confusion they lost the seal of the Letterist International. Linda [Fried] not sentenced yet. Sarah [Abouaf] still in the reformatory—but her sister, sixteen and a half, has taken her place. There have been other arrests, for narcotics, for who knows what else. It's getting very tiresome. There is G[uy]-E[rnest Debord], who has just spent ten days in a nursing home where his parents sent him following a failed attempt to gas himself. He's back in the neighbourhood now. Serge [Berna?] is due out on 12 May. The day before yesterday I threw up royally outside Moineau's. The latest diversion in the neighbourhood is spending the night in the Catacombs—another of Joël's bright ideas. I have a good many projects which are liable to remain just that—projects. ...\n\nDecades later, Debord would nostalgically (though also somewhat ambiguously) sum up the spirit of the times in his \"Panegyric\" (1989): \"Between the rue du Four and the rue de Buci, where our youth so completely went astray as a few glasses were drunk, one could feel certain that we would never do any better.\"\n\n\nSeveral others also passed through the LI during its five years of existence, including André-Frank Conord, Jacques Fillon, Abdelhafid Khatib, Henry de Béarn and Gaëtan M. Langlais. In addition, the central members (almost all of them men), would sometimes include their girlfriends' names (usually first names only) among the signatories to their texts. Worthy of special mention among these girlfriends is Eliane Papaï (1935–?). An alumna of the same Auteuil orphanage the letterists had attempted to liberate, she was first the girlfriend of Debord, then the wife of Mension, and finally the wife of Brau. Debord recalled her fondly in many of his later films and writings, and she herself (as Eliane Brau) produced a book on the Situationists in 1968, \"Le situationnisme ou la nouvelle internationale\".\n\nJean-Louis Brau, Gil Wolman and François Dufrêne founded a Second Letterist International (\"D.I.L.\", \"Deuxième Internationale Lettriste\") in 1964. The New Lettrist International was founded more recently and is independent of (though inspired by) the earlier group.\n\nThe LI published four issues of the \"Internationale Lettriste\" bulletin between 1952 and 1954, followed by twenty eight issues of \"Potlatch\" from 1954 to 1957. A further two issues of \"Potlatch\" appeared in November 1957 and July 1959, now with the revised subtitle \"Information bulletin of the Situationist International\". Each issue comprised between one and four mimeographed sheets. \"Les Lèvres Nues\", though not an LI publication, published some of their most important articles. All of these texts, together with a few other miscellaneous tracts, are reprinted in \"Documents Relatifs A La Fondation De L'Internationale Situationniste\" (Editions Allia, 1985).\n\nDebord's 1959 collaboration with Asger Jorn, \"Mémoires\", was directly concerned with the early days of the LI. The new Gallimard edition of his \"Oeuvres\" gathers many LI texts, including some never before published. Michèle Bernstein's novels, \"Tous les chevaux du roi\" (1960) and \"La Nuit\" (1961), present fictionalised accounts of her life with Debord during this period. Patrick Straram's \"Les bouteilles se couchent\" was a semi-fictionalised contemporary account of the scene, written in 1953 but lost until recently: it was published by Editions Allia in 2006. Also recently published by the same house are a biography of Ivan Chtcheglov and a separate collection of his writings. In October 2010, an unpublished text from the LI has just been released that recalls the adventures of the letterists between 1945 and February 1953 : \"Visages de l'avant-garde\" (Paris: Jean-Paul Rocher, éditeur, 2010).\n\nSources in English\n\nOther Sources\n\n\n"}

Soon after, she began working alongside her cousin in Port-au-Prince at a factory embellishing wedding dresses for export. Following the closing of the factory in 1990 due to political and economic issues, Delisme recalls having a dream in which she was visited by the spirits. When relating the dream to her father, an oungan (vodou priest), he interpreted the message to be from the vodou spirit or lwa named Erzulie. Erzulie, the spirit of love, is represented in vodou tradition by a heart, which was the same design symbolized in Delisme’s dream. Using beads left over from her time at the factory, the heart symbol visualized in her dream became the sequin design for her first drapo (flag).\n\nDelisme recollects having more than one dream in which spirits visited her. During the third dream, she was delivered the message that, “I did not have to work in the factory, but I could learn to work for myself and earn for my family.” In 1990, having lost her job at the factory in conjunction with the lwa messages, Delisme decided to begin her life as an independent artist at age 25. Delisme continued to master her needlework skills by creating more drapo, finding design inspiration from her dreams and vodou symbols given to her by her father. Much of Delisme’s beadwork incorporates designs that represent traditional Vodou deities and are used to explain divinity and give clarity to life’s expressions and meanings. Her flags represent her spirituality and are used for guidance, wisdom, and healing. Her bright color combinations within the sequins and beads add to the mood and spirit of each piece. Since becoming an independent artist, Delisme has built an atelier in Haiti. The workshop was constructed to more efficiently assemble the bead-work for her drapo designs. Delisme describes the envisioned designs to a paid artist to be drawn or traced for the drapo and once done, is passed on to be beaded by Delisme herself or one of her seven employed artists at the workshop.\n\nIn January 2010, Delisme’s hometown was at the epicenter of a massive earthquake. Delisme and her family were among those affected by the earthquakes destruction. Although her home and workshop in the capital were safe, 18 miles away, Delisme stated, “I felt I had to express the disaster in Haiti in my artwork.\"\n\nDuring the country’s recovery, the Smithsonian—in collaboration with the people of Haiti, several national and international agencies, and the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities—coordinated the 2010 Folklife Festival. The festival was an effort to salvage, restore, and safeguard art treasures damaged or endangered by the earthquake. Several artists, including Delisme, participated in the event by demonstrating and selling their artwork in the Festival Marketplace.\n\nIn 2011, Delisme’s work Catastrophe du 12 Janvier, a vodou flag created to depict the crumpled buildings and the bodies of the dead caused by the earthquake, was part of an annual exhibit at the Museum of International Folk Art titled “The Arts of Survival: Folk Expression in the Face of Natural Disaster.” The exhibit explored how folk artists helped their communities recover from four natural disasters that occurred around 2011: The Haitian Earthquake, Hurricane Katrina, Pakistani floods, and the Mt. Merapi volcanic explosion in Indonesia. Also part of International Folk Arts Week, Delisme sold more of her pieces at her booth during the Santa Fe International Folk Arts Market. She said she shipped about 160 flags and carried more in her suitcase in preparation for the event.\n\n\nWaterloo Center for the Arts\n\n"}
{"id": "1356108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1356108", "title": "Oil pastel", "text": "Oil pastel\n\nOil pastel (also called wax oil crayon) is a painting and drawing medium with characteristics similar to pastels and wax crayons. Unlike \"soft\" or \"Japanese\" pastel sticks, which are made with a gum or methyl cellulose binder, oil pastels consist of pigment mixed with a non-drying oil and wax binder. The surface of an oil pastel painting is therefore less powdery, but more difficult to protect with a fixative. Oil pastels provide a harder edge than \"soft\" or \"French\" pastels but are more difficult to blend. \n\nAt the end of World War I, Kanae Yamamoto proposed an overhaul of the Japanese education system. He thought that it had been geared too much towards uncritical absorption of information by imitation and wanted to promote a less restraining system, a vision he expounded in his book \"Theory of self-expression\" which described the \"Jiyu-ga\" method, \"learning without a teacher\". Teachers Rinzo Satake and his brother-in-law Shuku Sasaki read Yamamoto's work and became fanatical supporters. They became keen to implement his ideas by replacing the many hours Japanese children had to spend drawing ideograms with black Indian ink with free drawing hours, filled with as much color as possible. For this, they decided to produce an improved wax crayon and in 1921 founded the \"Sakura Cray-Pas Company\" and began production. The new product wasn't completely satisfactory, pigment concentration was low and blending or impasto was impossible, so in 1924 they decided to develop a high viscosity crayon: the oil pastel. This used a mixture of mashed paraffin, stearic acid and coconut oil as a binder. Designed as a relatively cheap, easily applied, colorful medium, oil pastels granted younger artists and students a greater freedom of expression than the expensive chalk-like pastels normally associated with the fine arts. Until the addition of a stabiliser in 1927, oil pastels came in two types: winter pastels with additional oil to prevent hardening and summer pastels with little oil to avoid melting. State schools simply couldn't afford the medium and, suspicious of the very idea of \"self-expression\" in general, favoured the coloured pencil, a cheaper German invention then widely promoted in Europe as a means to instill work discipline in young children.\n\nOil pastels were an immediate commercial success and other manufacturers were quick to take up the idea, such as Dutch company \"Talens\", who began to produce Panda Pastels in 1930. However, none of these were comparable to the professional quality oil pastels produced today. These early products were intended to introduce western art education to Japanese children, and not as a fine arts medium, although Sakura managed to persuade some avant-garde artists to acquaint themselves with the technique, among them Pablo Picasso. In 1947 Picasso, who for many years had been unable to procure oil pastels because of the war conditions, convinced Henri Sennelier, a French manufacturer who specialized in high quality art products, to develop a fine arts version. In 1949 Sennelier produced the first oil pastels intended for professionals and experienced artists. These were superior in wax viscosity, texture and pigment quality and capable of producing more consistent and attractive work. The Japanese \"Holbein\" brand of oil pastel appeared in the mid-1980s with both student and professional grades; the latter with a range of 225 colours. Another brand, Caran d'Ache, introduced Neocolor wax crayons onto the market in 1965, using a patented polyethylene wax with superior lubrication; in the nineties these were developed into an oil pastel, Neopastel.\n\nOil pastels can be used directly in dry form; when done lightly, the resulting effects are similar to oil paints. Heavy build-ups can create an almost impasto effect. Once applied to a surface, the oil pastel pigment can be manipulated with a brush moistened in white spirit, turpentine, linseed oil, or another type of vegetable oil or solvent. Alternatively, the drawing surface can be oiled before drawing or the pastel itself can be dipped in oil. Some of these solvents pose serious health concerns.\n\nOil pastels are considered a fast medium because they are easy to paint with and convenient to carry; for this reason they are often used for sketching, but can also be used for sustained works. Because oil pastels never dry out completely, they need to be protected somehow, often by applying a special fixative to the painting or placing the painting in a sleeve and then inside a frame. There are some known durability problems: firstly, as the oil doesn't dry, it keeps permeating the paper. This process degrades both the paper and the colour layer as it reduces the flexibility of the latter. A second problem is that the stearic acid makes the paper brittle. Lastly both the stearic acid and the wax will be prone to efflorescence or \"wax bloom\", the building-up of fatty acids and wax on the surface into an opaque white layer. This is easily made transparent again by gentle polishing with a woolen cloth; but the three effects together result in a colour layer consisting mainly of brittle stearic acid on top of brittle paper, a combination that will crumble easily. A long term concern is simple evaporation: palmitic acid is often present and half of it will have evaporated within 40 years; within 140 years half of the stearic acid will have disappeared. Impregnation of the entire art work by beeswax has been evaluated as a conservation measure.\n\nThe surface chosen for oil pastels can have a very dramatic effect on the final painting. Paper is a common surface but this medium can be used on other surfaces including wood, metal, hardboard (often known as \"masonite\"), MDF, canvas and glass. Many companies make papers specifically for pastels that are suitable for use with oil pastels.\n\nBuilding up layers of color with the oil pastel, called \"layering\", is a very common technique. Other techniques include \"underpainting\" and \"scraping down\" or sgraffito. Turpentine, or similar liquids such as mineral spirits, are often used as a blending tool to create a wash effect similar to some watercolor paintings. Commercially available oil sketching papers are preferred for such technique.\n\nThere are a number of types of oil pastels, each of which can be classified as either \"scholastic\", \"student\" or \"professional\" grade.\n\n\"Scholastic grade\", for example the Loew Cornell brand, is the lowest grade: generally the oil pastels are harder and less vibrant than higher grades. It is generally meant for children or people starting out with oil pastels, and is fairly cheap compared to other grades, often about US$5 for a large box. The middle grade, \"student grade\", is meant for art students and can be much more expensive but softer and more vibrant than scholastic grade. They are usually more expensive and cost around $1 to $2 each. An example of a student grade oil pastel is \"Van Gogh\", manufactured by Talens. \"Professional grade\" is the highest grade of oil pastel and can be very expensive, often costing $3 to $5 per oil pastel, but are also the softest and most vibrant. Professional quality brands of oil pastel include Sennelier, Holbein, Garich, and Sakura Specialist.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their company consisted of 12 adults and 3 children, drawn from English actors of \"modest accomplishment\". They arrived by the vessel \"Charming Sally\" at Yorktown, Virginia, on 2 June 1752, and made their early performances in nearby Williamsburg. Their first performance, \"The Merchant of Venice\", is generally considered to be the first professional staging of Shakespeare in America. \n\nIn 1753 the Hallam company moved to New York, and in 1754 they played in Philadelphia and in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1755 the company moved to the West Indies, and merged with the company of David Douglass. On Lewis' death, Douglass married his widow Sarah Hallam Douglass. Three years later, the company returned to tour the mainland, as the \"American Company\".\n\nLewis' son, Lewis Hallam, Jr., eighteen at the time of the American Company's first tour, took leading roles alongside Douglass. Lewis Jr.'s style was described as declaratory rather than realistic, but he was much admired and became known as America's leading Shakespearean interpreter. Douglass had his limitations: one Alexander Graydon described him as \"rather a decent than shining actor\". However, he was a capable manager and he gave North America its first Falstaff and King John. Within the repertoire was \"Cymbeline\", which proved a popular vehicle for two of the company's actresses, Margaret Cheer and Nancy Hallam.\n\nIn Quaker and Puritan areas, the company encountered religious opposition to theatre in general. At Rhode Island in 1761 they were obliged to perform Othello disguised as \"a series of moral dialogues\". In 1774, the Continental Congress banned theatre entirely, and the company resettled in Jamaica. By that time, Hugh F. Ranking calculates that the company had performed at least 180 times, their repertoire having included fourteen of Shakespeare's plays. After the peace of 1783, the company returned to New York, with Lewis Hallam Jr. as the leading actor, and John Henry as his co-manager. \n\nLewis Jr. is believed to be the first actor in America to perform in blackface in 1769.\n\nIn November 1766, when the Southwark Theatre in Philadelphia opened, the American Company had the following members:\n\nBy October 1767, new members were:\n\nIn 1792, John Hodgkinson joined.\n\nOther members included Thomas Wignell and Joseph Harper.\n"}

It can be said sometimes to be a type of urban legend, said to be passed down by older women to a younger generation. Such tales are considered superstition, folklore or unverified claims with exaggerated and/or inaccurate details. Old wives' tales often center on women's traditional concerns, such as pregnancy, puberty, social relations, health, herbalism and nutrition.\n\nIn this context, the word \"wife\" means \"woman\" rather than \"married woman\". This usage stems from Old English ' (\"woman\") and is akin to the German ' (also meaning \"woman\"). This sense of the word is still used in Modern English in constructions such as \"midwife\" and \"fishwife\".\n\nOld wives' tales are often invoked to discourage certain behaviors, usually of children, or to share knowledge of folk cures for ailments ranging from toothaches to dysentery.\n\nThe concept of old wives' tales has existed for centuries. In 1611, the King James Bible was published with the following translation of the Apostle Paul writing to his young protégé Timothy, \"But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness\" (I Timothy 4:7 KJV).\n\nOld wives' tales originate in the oral tradition of storytelling. They were generally propagated by illiterate women, telling stories to each other or to children. The stories do not attempt to moralise, but to teach lessons and make difficult concepts like death or coming of age easy for children to understand. These stories are also used to scare children so they don't do certain things.\n\nThese tales have often been collected by literate men, and turned into written works. Fairy tales by Basile, Perrault, and the Grimms have their roots in the oral tradition of women. These male writers took the stories from women, with their plucky, clever heroines and heroes, and turned them into morality tales for children.\n\nExamples of old wives' tales include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4387808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4387808", "title": "Ottoman miniature", "text": "Ottoman miniature\n\nOttoman miniature or Turkish miniature was an art form in the Ottoman Empire, which can be linked to the Persian miniature tradition, as well as strong Chinese artistic influences. It was a part of the Ottoman book arts, together with illumination (\"tezhip\"), calligraphy (\"hat\"), marbling paper (\"ebru\"), and bookbinding (\"cilt\"). The words \"taswir\" or \"nakish\" were used to define the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called Nakkashanes.\n\nThe miniatures were usually not signed, perhaps because of the rejection of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person; the head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours (which were called \"tahrir\") with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of third dimension. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text, were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding of perspective was different from that of the nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture. The miniatures followed closely the context of the book they were included in, resembling more illustrations rather than standalone works of art.\n\nThe colors for the miniature were obtained by ground powder pigments mixed with egg-white and, later, with diluted gum arabic. The produced colors were vivid. Contrasting colors used side by side with warm colors further emphasized this quality. The most used colors in Ottoman miniatures were bright red, scarlet, green, and different shades of blue.\n\nThe worldview underlying the Ottoman miniature painting was also different from that of the European Renaissance tradition. The painters did not mainly aim to depict the human beings and other living or non-living beings realistically, although increasing realism is found from the later 16th century and onwards. Like Plato, Ottoman tradition tended to reject mimesis, because according to the worldview of Sufism (a mystical form of Islam widespread at the popular level in the Ottoman Empire), the appearance of worldly beings was not permanent and worth devoting effort to, resulting in stylized and abstracted illustrations.\n\nDuring the reign of Mehmed II, a court workshop called \"Nakkashane-i Rum\" that also functioned as an academy was founded in Topkapı Palace in Istanbul to create illuminated picture manuscripts for the Sultan and the courtiers.\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, the Herat workshop of Persian miniaturists was closed, and its famous instructor Behzad (or Bihzad) went to Tabriz. After the Ottoman emperor Selim I briefly conquered Tabriz in 1514, taking many manuscripts back to Istanbul, the \"Nakkashane-i Irani\" (The Persian Academy of Painting) was founded in Topkapı Palace for imported Persian artists. The artists of these two painting academies formed two different schools of painting: The artists in \"Nakkashane-i Rum\" were specialized in documentary books, like the \"Shehinshahname\", showing the public, and to some extent the private, lives of rulers, their portraits and historical events; Shemaili Ali Osman—portraits of rulers; \"Surname\"—pictures depicting weddings and especially circumcision festivities; Shecaatname-wars commanded by pashas. The artists in \"Nakkashanei-i Irani\" specialized in traditional Persian poetic works, like the \"Shahnameh\", the \"Khamsa of Nizami\", containing \"Layla and Majnun\" and the \"Iskendername\" or \"Romance of Alexander\", Humayunname, animal fables, and anthologies. There were also scientific books on botany and animals, alchemy, cosmography, and medicine; technical books; love letters; books about astrology; and dream reading.\n\nThe reigns of Suleyman the Magnificent (1520–1566) and especially Selim II (1566–1574) in the second half of the 16th century were the golden age of the Ottoman miniature, with its own characteristics and authentic qualities. Nakkaş Osman (often known as Osman the Miniaturist) was the most important miniature painter of the period, while Nigari developed portrait painting.\n\nMatrakçı Nasuh was a famous miniature painter during the reigns of Selim I and Suleyman the Magnificent. He created a new painting genre called topographic painting. He painted cities, ports, and castles without any human figures and combined scenes observed from different viewpoints in one picture.\n\nDuring the reigns of Selim II (1566–1574) and Murat III (1574–1595), the classical Ottoman miniature style was created. The renowned miniature painters of the period were Nakkaş Osman, Ali Çelebi, Molla Kasım, Hasan Pasha, and Lütfi Abdullah.\n\nBy the end of the 16th century and in the beginning of the 17th century, especially during the reign of Ahmed I, single page miniatures intended to be collected in albums or \"murakkas\" were popular. They had existed at the time of Murat III, who ordered an album of them from the painter Velijan. In the 17th century, miniature painting was also popular among the citizens of Istanbul. Artists under the name of \"Bazaar Painters\" () worked with other artisans in the bazaars of Istanbul at the demand of citizens.\n\nA new cultural genre known in Ottoman history as the Tulip period occurred during the reign of Ahmed III. Some art historians attribute the birth of the unique style called \"Ottoman Baroque\" to this period. The characteristics of the period carried the influences of French baroque. In this period, a grand festival for the circumcision rituals for the sons of Ahmed III was organized. Artisans, theatre groups, clowns, musicians, trapeze dancers, and citizens joined in the festivities. A book called \"Surname-i Vehbi\" tells about this festival. This book was depicted by Abdulcelil Levni (the name \"Levni\" is related to the Arabic word levn (\"color\") and was given to the artist because of the colorful nature of his paintings) and his apprentices. His style of painting was influenced by Western painting and very different from the earlier miniature paintings.\n\nAfter Levni, Westernization of Ottoman culture continued, and with the introduction of printing press and later photography, no more illuminated picture manuscripts were produced. From then on, wall paintings or oil paintings on toils were popular. The miniature painting thus lost its function.\n\nAfter a period of crisis in the beginning of the 20th century, miniature painting was accepted as a \"decorative art\" by the intellectuals of the newly founded Turkish Republic, and in 1936, a division called \"Turkish Decorative Arts\" was established in the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul, which included miniature painting together with the other Ottoman book arts. The historian and author Süheyl Ünver educated many artists following the tradition of Ottoman book arts.\n\nContemporary miniature artists include Ömer Faruk Atabek, Sahin Inaloz, Cahide Keskiner, Gülbün Mesara, Nur Nevin Akyazıcı, Ahmet Yakupoğlu, Nusret Çolpan, Orhan Dağlı, and many others from the new generation. Contemporary artists usually do not consider miniature painting as merely a \"decorative art\" but as a fine art form. Different from the traditional masters of the past, they work individually and sign their works. Also, their works are not illustrating books, as was the case with the original Ottoman miniatures, but being exhibited in fine art galleries.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "976531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=976531", "title": "Outline (list)", "text": "Outline (list)\n\nAn outline, also called a hierarchical outline, is a list arranged to show hierarchical relationships and is a type of tree structure. An outline is used to present the main points (in sentences) or topics (terms) of a given subject. Each item in an outline may be divided into additional sub-items. If an organizational level in an outline is to be sub-divided, it shall have at least two subcategories, as advised by major style manuals in current use. An outline may be used as a drafting tool of a document, or as a summary of the content of a document or of the knowledge in an entire field. It is not to be confused with the general context of the term \"outline\", which a summary or overview of a subject, presented verbally or written in prose (for example, \"The Outline of History\" is not an outline of the type presented below). The outlines described in this article are lists, and come in several varieties.\n\nA sentence outline is a tool for composing a document, such as an essay, a paper, a book, or even an encyclopedia. It is a list used to organize the facts or points to be covered, and their order of presentation, by section. Topic outlines list the subtopics of a subject, arranged in levels, and while they can be used to plan a composition, they are most often used as a summary, such as in the form of a table of contents or the topic list in a college course's syllabus.\n\nOutlines are further differentiated by the index prefixing used, or lack thereof. Many outlines include a numerical or alphanumerical prefix preceding each entry in the outline, to provide a specific path for each item, to aid in referring to and discussing the entries listed. An alphanumerical outline uses alternating letters and numbers to identify entries. A decimal outline uses only numbers as prefixes. An outline without prefixes is called a \"bare outline\".\n\nSpecialized applications of outlines also exist. A reverse outline is a list of sentences or topics that is created from an existing work, as a revision tool; it may show the gaps in the document's coverage so that they may be filled, and may help in rearranging sentences or topics to improve the structure and flow of the work. An integrated outline is a composition tool for writing scholastic works, in which the sources, and the writer's notes from the sources, are integrated into the outline for ease of reference during the writing process.\n\nA software program designed for processing outlines is called an outliner.\n\nOutlines are differentiated by style, the inclusion of prefixes, and specialized purpose. There are also hand-written outlines (which are highly limited in utility), and digitized outlines, such as those contained within an outliner (which are much more useful).\n\nThere are two main styles of outline: sentence outlines and topic outlines.\n\nPropædia is the historical attempt of the Encyclopædia Britannica to present a hierarchical \"Outline of Knowledge\" in a separate volume in the 15th edition of 1974. The \"Outline of Knowledge\" was a project by Mortimer Adler. Propædia had three levels, 10 \"Parts\" at the top level, 41 \"Divisions\" at the middle level and 167 \"Sections\" at the bottom level, numbered, for example, \"1. Matter and Energy\", \"1.1 Atoms\", \"1.1.1. Structure and Properties of Atoms\".\n\nA feature included in many outlines is prefixing. Similar to section numbers, an outline prefix is a label (usually alphanumeric or numeric) placed at the beginning of an outline entry to assist in referring to it.\n\nBare outlines include no prefixes.\n\nAn \"alphanumeric outline\" includes a prefix at the beginning of each topic as a reference aid. The prefix is in the form of Roman numerals for the top level, upper-case letters (in the alphabet of the language being used) for the next level, Arabic numerals for the next level, and then lowercase letters for the next level. For further levels, the order is started over again. Each numeral or letter is followed by a period, and each item is capitalized, as in the following sample:\n\nSome call the Roman numerals \"A-heads\" (for \"A-level headings\"), the upper-case letters, \"B-heads\", and so on. Some writers also prefer to insert a blank line between the A-heads and B-heads, while often keeping the B-heads and C-heads together.\n\nIf more levels of outline are needed, lower-case Roman numerals and numbers and lower-case letters, sometimes with single and double parenthesis can be used, although the exact order is not well defined, and usage varies widely.\n\nThe scheme recommended by the \"MLA Handbook\", and the \"Purdue Online Writing Lab\", among others, uses the usual five levels, as described above, then repeats the Arabic numerals and lower-case letter surrounded by parentheses (round brackets) – I. A. 1. a. i. (1) (a) – and does not specify any lower levels, though \"(i)\" is usually next. In common practice, lower levels yet are usually Arabic numerals and lowercase letters again, and sometimes lower-case Roman again, with single parentheses – 1) a) i) – but usage varies. MLA style is sometimes incorrectly referred to as APA style, but the \"APA Publication Manual\" does not address outline formatting at all.\n\nA very different style recommended by \"The Chicago Manual of Style\", based on the practice of the United States Congress in drafting legislation, suggests the following sequence, from the top to the seventh level (the only ones specified): I. A. 1. \"a\") (1) (\"a\") \"i\") – capital Roman numerals with a period, capital letters with a period, Arabic numerals with a period, italic lowercase letters with a single parenthesis, Arabic numerals with a double parenthesis, italic lowercase letters with a double parenthesis, and italic lowercase Roman numerals with a single parentheses, though the italics are not required). Because of its use in the US Code and other US law books, Many American lawyers consequently use this outline format.\n\nAnother alternative scheme repeats all five levels with a single parenthesis for the second five – I) A) 1) a) i) – and then again with a double parenthesis for the third five – (I) (A) (1) (a) (i).\n\nMany oft-cited style guides besides the \"APA Publication Manual\", including the \"AP Stylebook\", the \"NYT Manual\", Fowler, \"The Guardian\" Style Guide, and Strunk & White, are curiously silent on the topic.\n\nOne side effect of the use of both Roman numerals and uppercase letters in all of these styles of outlining is that in most alphabets, \"I.\" may be an item at both the top (A-head) and second (B-head) levels. This is usually not problematic because lower level items are usually referred to hierarchically. For example, the third sub-sub-item of the fourth sub-item of the second item is item II. D. 3. So, the ninth sub-item (letter-I) of the first item (Roman-I) is item I. I., and only the top level one is item I.\n\nThe \"decimal outline\" format has the advantage of showing how every item at every level relates to the whole, as shown in the following sample outline:\n\nSpecial types of outlines include reverse outlines and integrated outlines.\n\nA \"reverse outline\" is an outline made from an existing work. Reverse outlining is like reverse engineering a document. The points or topics are extracted from the work, and are arranged in their order of presentation, by section, in the outline. Once completed, the outline can be filled in and rearranged as a plan for a new improved version of the document.\n\nAn \"integrated outline\" is a helpful step in the process of organizing and writing a scholarly paper (literature review, research paper, thesis or dissertation). When completed the integrated outline contains the relevant scholarly sources (author's last name, publication year, page number if quote) for each section in the outline. An integrated outline is generally prepared after the scholar has collected, read and mastered the literature that will be used in the research paper. Shields and Rangarajan (2013) recommend that new scholars develop a system to do this. Part of the system should contain a systematic way to take notes on the scholarly sources. These notes can then be tied to the paper through the integrated outline. This way the scholar reviews all of the literature before the writing begins.\n\nAn integrated outline can be a helpful tool for people with writer's block because the content of the paper is organized and identified prior to writing. The structure and content is combined and the author can write a small section at a time. The process is less overwhelming because it can be separated into manageable chunks. The first draft can be written using smaller blocks of time.\n\nFor a comparison, see Outliners, below.\n\nOutlines are used for composition, summarization, and as a development and storage medium.\n\n\"Merriam-Webster's manual for writers and editors\" (1998, p. 290) recommends that the section headings of an article should when read in isolation, combine to form an outline of the article content. Garson (2002) distinguishes a 'standard outline', presented as a regular table of contents from a refined tree-like 'hierarchical outline', stating that \"such an outline might be appropriate, for instance, when the purpose is taxonomic (placing observed phenomena into an exhaustive set of categories). ... hierarchical outlines are rare in quantitative writing, and the researcher is well advised to stick to the standard outline unless there are compelling reasons not to.\"\n\nWriters of fiction and creative nonfiction, such as Jon Franklin, may use outlines to establish plot sequence, character development and dramatic flow of a story, sometimes in conjunction with free writing.\n\nPreparation of an outline is an intermediate step in the process of writing a scholarly research paper, literature review, thesis or dissertation. A special kind of outline (integrated outline) incorporates scholarly sources into the outline before the writing begins.\n\nIn addition to being used as a composition tool during the drafting process, outlines can also be used as a publishing format. Outlines can presented as work's table of contents, but they can also be used as the body of a work. The \"Outline of Knowledge\" from the 15th edition of the \"Encyclopedia Britannica\" is an example of this. Wikipedia includes outlines that summarize subjects (for example, see Outline of chess, Outline of Mars, and Outline of knowledge).\n\nProfessors often hand out to their students at the beginning of a term, a summary of the subjects to be covered throughout the course in the form of a topic outline. It may also be included as part of a larger course synopsis.\n\nOutlines are also used to summarize talking points for a speech or lecture.\n\nOutlines, especially those used within an outliner, can be used for planning, scheduling, and recording.\n\nAn outliner (or \"outline processor\") is a specialized type of word processor used to view, create, build, modify, and maintain outlines. It is a computer program, or part of one, used for displaying, organizing, and editing hierarchically arranged text in an outline's tree structure. Textual information is contained in discrete sections called \"nodes\", which are arranged according to their topic-subtopic (parent-child) relationships, sort of like the members of a family tree. When loaded into an outliner, an outline may be collapsed or expanded to display as few or as many levels as desired.\n\nOutliners are used for storing and retrieving textual information, with terms, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs attached to a tree. So rather than being arranged by document, information is arranged by topic or content. An outline in an outliner may contain as many topics as desired. This eliminates the need to have separate documents, as outlines easily include other outlines just by adding to the tree.\n\nThe main difference between a hand-written outline and a digital one, is that the former is usually limited to a summary or blueprint of a planned document, while the latter may easily include all of the content of the entire document and many more. In other words, as a hand-written work an outline is a writing tool, but on a computer, it is a general purpose format supported by a robust development and display medium capable of handling knowledge from its creation to its end use.\n\nOutliners may be used in content creation instead of general word processors for capturing, organizing, editing, and displaying knowledge or general textual information. Outliners are ideal for managing lists, organizing facts and ideas, and for writing computer programs. They are also used for goal and task management (including personal information management and project management), and for writing books and movie scripts.\n\nThe graphical counterpart to outliners are mind mappers.\n\n\n"}

She has been considered a scholar on the subject of animation and an experienced animator herself. Bond's animations and short films have been shown at film festivals including the Sundance Film Festival. Bond is also known for her architectural animation installations. She shown work at Exeter Castle in 2010 and created a prototype animation for the Smithsonian. Bond's hand-painted films are held in the film collection at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nBond was born in Canada and raised in Oregon. She reports that she had been drawing and recognized for her art since she was in kindergarten. Bond graduated from Portland State University (PSU) with a bachelor's degree in 1971 and later with a master's degree in education in 1976. Bond struggled with making her creative visions a reality while she was in college, and believed that teaching art was the only way she could make a living. Later, she received a masters of fine arts from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where she studied experimental film-making.\n\nOn September 18, 2001, Bond created and registered a business for her animations in Oregon under the name Rose Bond Moving Pictures.\n\nCurrently, Bond teaches at the Pacific Northwest College of Art (PNCA) in Portland, Oregon, where she is an associate professor and a lead faculty in Animated Arts.\n\nBond started out using traditional methods of creating animation with flipbooks and inking by hand. Later she began to experiment with using computers. She uses digital tablets, like those made by Wacom, to teach her students at PNCA. Her current work is mainly public art featuring site-specific animations which use a combination of hand-drawn and digital art.\n\nBond's earlier films deal with feminist issues, questioning whether one gender should rule over another through the medium of animated Irish legends. In these stories (\"Deirdre's Choice, Macha's Curse and Cerridwen's Gift\"), based on figures from Irish legends, Bond painted directly onto clear 35 mm film to create the effect of animation. Her hand-drawn and hand-painted images for these films were considered dramatic by reviewer, Wendy Jackson, who also felt that Bond's choice of heroines showed a \"feminist sensibility.\"\n\nBond's first animation installation was staged in 2002 in Portland, using the historic Seamen's Bethel Building. Her installation work \"challenges people to think about how they perceive time, space, and memory.\" When beginning a new animation projection, Bond researches the history of the building and incorporates it into the projection. She visits each spot where she will be creating an installation, exploring the buildings and gleaning interesting historical facts to use in her animations. In \"Broadsided!\", her animation commissioned by the Exeter Arts Council for Exeter Castle, Bond discovered the story of a man who was hung for stealing sheep which she uses in her animated story.\n\nOne of her most shown installations, \"Intra Muros\" (2007), was shown at the first Platform Animation Festival in Portland and consists of projected animations in the windows that loop every eight minutes. \"Intra Muros\" invites viewers to wonder what is going on in the spaces they cannot see. Bond's installation, \"Gates of Light\", reached audiences that were not familiar with experimental film. Bond's projected animations also have the unique capacity to turn the mundane building people see everyday into something special and to challenge with her work, a viewer's \"sense of familiarity.\" Bond is excited about the potential for animation to change the \"cultural landscape.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is known for his ability to draw from memory a landscape after seeing it just once. His work has gained worldwide popularity.\n\nIn 2006, Wiltshire was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to art. In the same year, he opened a permanent gallery on the Royal Opera Arcade in London.\n\nStephen Wiltshire was born in London, England, in 1974 to Caribbean parents; his father, Colvin, was a native of Barbados, and his mother, Geneva, is a native of St. Lucia. He grew up in Little Venice, Maida Vale, London. Wiltshire was mute when young. At the age of three, he was diagnosed with autism. The same year, his father died in a motorbike accident.\n\nAt the age of five, Wiltshire was sent to Queensmill School in London where he expressed interest in drawing. His early illustrations depicted animals and cars; he is still extremely interested in American cars and is said to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of them. When he was about seven, Wiltshire became fascinated with sketching landmark London buildings. After being shown a book of photos depicting the devastation wrought by earthquakes, he began to create detailed architectural drawings of imaginary cityscapes. He began to communicate through his art. The instructors at Queensmill School would deal with his lack of verbal communication skills by temporarily taking away his art supplies so that he would be forced to learn to ask for them. Stephen responded by making sounds and eventually uttered his first word—\"paper.\" His teachers encouraged his drawing, and with their aid Wiltshire learned to speak fully at the age of nine.\n\nIn June 2015, the BBC’s Lucy Ash reported: \"Soon people outside the school started noticing Stephen's gift and aged eight he landed his first commission - a sketch of Salisbury Cathedral for the former Prime Minister Edward Heath\". When he was ten, Wiltshire drew a sequence of drawings of London landmarks, one for each letter, that he called a \"London Alphabet\".\n\nIn 1987, Wiltshire was part of the BBC programme \"The Foolish Wise Ones\". \"Drawings\", a collection of his works, was published that same year.\n\nBetween 1995 and his graduation in 1998, Wiltshire attended the City and Guilds of London Art School in Kennington, Lambeth, South London.\n\nWiltshire can look at a subject once and then draw an accurate and detailed picture of it. He frequently draws entire cities from memory, based on single, brief helicopter rides. For example, he produced a detailed drawing of four square miles of London after a single helicopter ride above that city. His nineteen-foot-long drawing of 305 square miles of New York City is based on a single twenty-minute helicopter ride. He also draws fictional scenes, for example, St. Paul's Cathedral surrounded by flames.\n\nWiltshire's early books include \"Drawings\" (1987), \"Cities\" (1989), \"Floating Cities\" (1991), and \"Stephen Wiltshire's American Dream\" (1993). His third book, \"Floating Cities\" (Michael Joseph, 1991), was number one on the \"Sunday Times\" best-seller list.\n\nIn 2003, a retrospective of his work, 'Not a Camera: the Unique Vision of Stephen Wiltshire', was held in the Orleans House gallery in Twickenham, London.\n\nIn May 2005 Wiltshire produced his longest ever panoramic memory drawing of Tokyo on a canvas within seven days following a helicopter ride over the city. Since then he has drawn Rome, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Madrid, Dubai, Jerusalem and London on giant canvasses. When Wiltshire took the helicopter ride over Rome, he drew it in such great detail that he drew the exact number of columns in the Pantheon.\n\nIn October 2009 Wiltshire completed the last work in the series of panoramas, an memory drawing of his \"spiritual home\", New York City. Following a 20-minute helicopter ride over the city he sketched the view of Manhattan, the Hudson shoreline of New Jersey, the Financial District, Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty, and Brooklyn over five days at the Pratt Institute, a college of art and design in New York City.\n\nIn 2010, he made a panorama of Sydney to raise funds for and awareness of Autism Spectrum Australia (Aspect). He visited Bermuda National Gallery where the sale of his donated drawing of Hamilton raised over $22,000. In June 2010, Christie's auctioned off an oil painting of his \"Times Square at Night\".\n\nWiltshire started a tour of China in September 2010, with a first project taking him to Shanghai.\n\nA 2011 project in New York City involved Wiltshire's creation of a long panoramic memory drawing of New York which is now displayed on a giant billboard at John F. Kennedy International Airport. It is a part of a global advertising campaign for the Swiss bank UBS that carries the theme \"We will not rest\", \"The New York Times\" reported.\n\nIn July 2014, Wiltshire drew an aerial panorama of the Singapore skyline from memory after a brief helicopter ride, taking five days to complete the 1 x 4m artwork. The artwork was presented to President Tony Tan as the Singapore Press Holding (SPH)'s gift to the nation in celebration of Singapore's 50th birthday in 2015, and will be displayed at Singapore City Gallery, visitor centre of the country's urban planning authority, Urban Redevelopment Authority.\n\nWiltshire's work has been the subject of many TV documentaries. Renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks wrote about him in a chapter on prodigies in his book \"An Anthropologist on Mars\".\n\nIn 1989, Wiltshire appeared on the cover of \"You\" magazine with actor Dustin Hoffman, who had portrayed autistic savant Raymond Babbitt in the 1988 Oscar-winning film, \"Rain Man\", which Wiltshire considers to be one of his favorite movies.\n\nIn 2006, Wiltshire was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to art. In September 2006 Wiltshire opened his permanent gallery in the Royal Opera Arcade, Pall Mall, London.\n\nOn 15 February 2008, ABC News named him \"Person of the Week\".\n\nIn July 2009 he acted as ambassador of the Children's Art Day in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2011, Wiltshire was made an honorary Fellow of the Society of Architectural Illustration (SAI). In January 2015 Wiltshire was also made an honorary Fellow of The Scottish Association of Architectural Artists.\n\n"}

Evelyn is romantically involved with Cynthia and works as a maid in her home, where she is subject to strict behavioural expectations and high standards for cleanliness. When Evelyn does not complete tasks to Cynthia's satisfaction, she is punished.\n\nAs Cynthia increasingly falters in her dominance, it becomes apparent that Evelyn is orchestrating Cynthia's role in the relationship by writing instructions and scripts for specific scenes, which the couple acts out in the same way each day. While Evelyn finds the scenes to be sexually exciting, Cynthia only acts them out to sate her lover. She attempts to please Evelyn by ordering a carpenter to construct a bed with a drawer underneath for Evelyn to sleep in as a punishment; however, Evelyn is unhappy with the length of time it will take to produce the bed, and ultimately refuses the gift.\n\nEvelyn begins to demand that Cynthia lock her in a trunk in the evening as a new punishment. Cynthia agrees, but she is resentful about the new physical separation. Cynthia also becomes self-conscious about her aging, having injured her back moving the trunk to her bedside. She expresses her unhappiness on Evelyn's birthday, when she demands that Evelyn bake her own birthday cake, which Cynthia eats while reclining with her feet resting on Evelyn's face. Evelyn does not enjoy the scene and calls out her safeword, \"pinastri\", which Cynthia ignores.\n\nThe couple's relationship becomes more strained as Evelyn's expectations go unfulfilled. Finally, Cynthia accuses Evelyn of polishing another lecturer's boots, which she considers to be an act of betrayal. The two eventually seem to make up, and Evelyn agrees to put less emphasis on her sexual needs. The film ends with the couple going through the same play routine seen at the film's start.\n\n\nAs lepidopterology (the study of moths and butterflies) is a theme throughout the film, the title refers to the Duke of Burgundy (\"Hamearis lucina\") butterfly, although it is no longer known \"how [it] received that name in the first place, any reasoning being lost in the mists of entomological antiquity.\"\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 93%, based on 92 reviews, with an average rating of 8 out of 10. The critical consensus reads \"Stylish, sensual, and smart, \"The Duke of Burgundy\" proves that erotic cinema can have genuine substance\". At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score, the film has a score of 87 out of 100, based on 24 reviews.\n\nThe A.V. Club called \"The Duke of Burgundy\" the 4th best film of 2015. In his initial review for The A.V. Club, Mike D'Angelo called the film \"a beautiful love story disguised as stylish smut\", assigning it an A grade. The film's score by Cat's Eyes also received positive attention, with critic Noel Murray asserting that it deserved an Oscar nod despite the relative obscurity of the film.\n\nStrickland received The Wouter Barendrecht Pioneering Vision Award at the Hamptons International Film Festival for his work in the film. The film also won the Grand Jury Prize at the 23rd Philadelphia Film Festival.\n\n\"The Duke of Burgundy\" was released by Cat's Eyes in February 2015. \n\n"}
{"id": "50410718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50410718", "title": "The Fountain of Youth (Cranach)", "text": "The Fountain of Youth (Cranach)\n\nThe Fountain of Youth is a painting by Lucas Cranach the Elder from the year 1546.\n\nThe image is an oil painting on a lime wood board, executed in landscape format with the dimensions 186.1 x 120.6 centimeters. It shows on the bottom center, a winged serpent in flight from Cranach's workshop and the year 1546.\nIt shows a fountain where older women but not men bathe, are rejuvenated and finally indulge in music, dance and good food. Cranach presents in this fairy tale image, in many details the real bathing culture of the Middle Ages, that based on the belief that certain baths might heal and rejuvenate. Sensual pleasures belonged to the bathroom now. The picture belonged to the inventory of the former Prussian royal palaces, and now hangs in the Gemäldegalerie museum in Berlin.\n\nThe background depicts a fantastic rocky landscape with unreal perspectives and proportions. A miniature castle on a rock can be seen on the far left, leaning over a cliff. In the center background a medieval city view is painted with a stone arch bridge over a river, which leads to the town. On the right a mighty mountain range is surrounded with lush fields and fruit trees. The barren rock on the left half symbolizes the arduous age of women, whilst the dense green forest on the right acts as a metaphor for youth. The basin, which covers the center foreground, is shown from a high point of view and is depicted as a square, surrounded by steps leading into the basin. The column-shaped fountain in the middle of the pool is crowned with the figures of Venus and Cupid, suggesting that the bath serves the force of love.\n\nThe foreground shows us the effect of the fountain, with elderly women, frail and worn, some even unable to walk, being led to the pool. They undress, get into the healing water, and appear rejuvenated on the right side of the pool, where a gallant young man shows them into a tent. Here the women get dressed before they can move on to indulge in sensual pleasures, as suggested in the right background, where young couples are dancing and dining to music. On the left edge of the pool we can see a man in a red jacket holding a book. He gazes at one of the elderly nude women, which suggests that he is a scholar or doctor, examining the effect of the fountain. On the edge of the basin, two women wrapped in towels are shown. These women, of which one sits at the front left corner and the other at the center bottom of the basin, seem to be reluctant to get into the water, doubting whether a rejuvenated life is even desirable. The fact that only women attend this bath, is due to the belief that older men would automatically rejuvenate in dealing with young women. In reality such alleged healing springs were also visited by men. In Cranach's picture all men are young, represented gallant and advantageous towards the elder women, however ugly and unattractive. Spread over the entire image, Cranach's figures refer to the individual stages of supernatural transformation: it is the search for paradise. The picture shows a man's dream. Bathing was associated with health, which easily led to the belief in broader effects of water, as shown by baptismal rites of religions. The fountain was a popular motif in medieval narratives, especially in medieval French literature, and offered versatile opportunities for depictions of nudes and genre scenes.\n\nThe presentation of old naked women is very uncommon for the art of this period: idealized nudes of young men and women were a more widespread genre. The beauty ideal for women in Cranach's age consisted of a bulging belly, round shapes without pubic hair, high-set breasts with small nipples and fair hair. Most of the figures in Cranach's work follow the ideals of beauty of the time and leads experts to believe that this painting is by his hand. However, the attribution of the picture is not certain. Research calls both Lucas Cranach the Elder and his son as the author. Lately it is associated with the late work of the father, but other employees of the Cranach workshop were probably involved in the execution. It is believed that the painting was commissioned, by an unknown client.\n\nBy 1830, the fountain was part of the management of the royal palaces. Then it came to the Royal Museum and now hangs in the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin.\n\n"}

{"id": "1037479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1037479", "title": "The Royal Albert Dock Liverpool", "text": "The Royal Albert Dock Liverpool\n\nThe Royal Albert Dock is a complex of dock buildings and warehouses in Liverpool, England. Designed by Jesse Hartley and Philip Hardwick, it was opened in 1846, and was the first structure in Britain to be built from cast iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood. As a result, it was the first non-combustible warehouse system in the world.\n\nAt the time of its construction the Albert Dock (as it was formerly known before receiving its Royal status in 2018) was considered a revolutionary docking system because ships were loaded and unloaded directly from/to the warehouses. Two years after it opened it was modified to feature the world's first hydraulic cranes. Due to its open yet secure design, the Albert Dock became a popular store for valuable cargoes such as brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. However, despite the Albert Dock's advanced design, the rapid development of shipping technology meant that within 50 years, larger, more open docks were required, although it remained a valuable store for cargo.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Albert Dock was requisitioned by the Admiralty serving as a base for boats of the British Atlantic Fleet. The complex was damaged during air raids on Liverpool, notably during the May Blitz of 1941. In the aftermath of the war, the financial problems of the owners and the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock was uncertain. Numerous plans were developed for the re-use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed. Having lain derelict for nearly ten years, the redevelopment of the dock began in 1981, when the Merseyside Development Corporation was set up, with the Albert Dock being officially re-opened in 1984.\n\nToday the Royal Albert Dock is a major tourist attraction in the city and the most visited multi-use attraction in the United Kingdom, outside London. It is a vital component of Liverpool's UNESCO designated World Heritage Maritime Mercantile City and the docking complex and warehouses also comprise the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in the UK.\n\nThe history of the Albert Dock dates back to 1837, when Jesse Hartley first began the development of plans for a combined dock and warehouse system. The plans drawn up by Hartley and fellow civil engineer Philip Hardwick for the Albert Dock were at the time considered quite 'radical', as they envisioned the loading and unloading of ships directly from the warehouses. However, this idea was not new, and as far back as the 1803 Warehousing Act, legislation had been passed to allow this form of development to occur, whilst the concept was first actually used in the construction of St Katharine's Dock in London, which was opened in 1828. As part of the development process, Hartley was eager to test the fire resistance of any particular design by constructing an by dummy structure, filling it with timber and tar, and setting it alight. After testing several structural designs he settled on the combination of cast iron, brick, sandstone and granite. The design was submitted for planning permission in 1839 although it wasn't until 1841, when the bill authorising the design of the dock was eventually passed by Parliament, that construction was allowed to begin.\nThe site chosen for the dock to be built on was an area of land bordered by Salthouse Dock to the east, the entrance channel to Canning Dock to the north and by Duke's Dock to the south. The land earmarked for the site had to be cleared, with 59 tenants being evicted and numerous premises demolished including a pub, several houses and the Dock Trustee's Dockyard. Upon the clearance of this land both the Salthouse and Canning dock's were drained to allow entrance passages into the Albert Dock to be constructed, whilst hundreds of 'Navvies' were employed to dig out the dock basin and construct the new river wall. The dock basin was completed by February 1845, allowing the first ships to enter the Albert Dock, although with the warehouses still under construction this was merely to allow these boats to 'lay-up'.\n\nThe dock complex was officially opened in 1846 by Albert, Prince Consort, husband of Queen Victoria and the man in honour of whom it was named. This event marked the first occasion in Liverpool's history in which a member of the Royal Family had made a state visit to the city and as a result the occasion was marked with a major celebrations. Many thousands of people turned out for the Royal visit with the newspaper \"The Pictorial Times\" noting the reception Prince Albert received:\n\"His reception was most enthusiastic; balconies were erected along the line of procession, and these and the windows of houses were filled with gay and animated parties. There was a most brilliant display of flags, banners & c. [sic]. All business is suspended. There are 200,000 strangers in town, and all the inhabitants are in the streets. All is gaiety and splendour.\" (\"The Pictorial Times\", 1846).\nThe Prince was taken on a processional tour through the city, including a visit to the town hall where the royal address was made, before departing aboard the ferry across to the Cheshire side of the Mersey and then northwards towards the Albert Dock. Again this stage of the procession route was laden with onlookers with \"The Pictorial Times\" describing the Prince's entrance into the Albert Dock:\n\"From the Cheshire side of the river the Fairy crossed to the Liverpool side, and returned along the line of docks amidst the cheers of assembled thousands and the roar of artillery. The sight was really magnificent, all the ships in the docks were decked out in gayest colours and the river was crowded with boats filled with people. At half-past two the fairy entered the dock, where were assembled two thousand ladies and gentlemen, the elite of the town; they cheered enthusiastically, which his Royal Highness returned, and in order to gratify the crowd sailed round the dock.\" (\"The Pictorial Times\", 1846).\nDespite the official opening occurring in 1846, the construction of the Albert Dock was not fully completed until 1847. In 1848, a new dock office was built and the dock itself was upgraded to feature a hydraulic cargo handling hoist system, the first of its kind in the world. Over the next decade several more buildings where added including houses for the piermaster, his assistant & the warehouse superintendent; and a cooperage. Warehousing in the dock was also expanded to meet the increasing demand by joining together the eastern and western ends of the Southern Stack.\n\nThe enclosed design of the Albert Dock and the direct loading and unloading of goods from warehouses meant that the complex was more secure than other docks within Liverpool. As a result it became a popular store for valuable cargoes including brandy, cotton, tea, silk, tobacco, ivory and sugar. At the same time their openness to natural light and well ventilated stores meant natural goods such as hemp or sugar could be kept fresher, for longer. The dock came to dominate Liverpool's far eastern trade, with over 90% of the city's silk imports from China coming through it and more generally half of all the far eastern trade income.\n\nDespite the great prosperity the dock afforded the city, within 20 years of its construction the Albert Dock was beginning to struggle. Designed and constructed to handle sailing ships of up to 1,000 tonnes, by the start of the 20th century only 7% of ships into the Port of Liverpool were sailing vessels. The development of steam ships in the later 19th century meant that soon the dock simply wasn't large enough, as its narrow entrances prevented larger vessels from entering it. Its lack of quayside was also becoming an issue. Generally steamships could be loaded and unloaded far quicker than sailing ships, and in a cruel twist of irony, the dockside warehouses that had once made the Albert Dock so attractive, were now hindering its future development. Nonetheless the Albert Dock remained an integral part of the dock system in Liverpool and in 1878 the pump house was built as part of redevelopment that saw the majority of the cranes converted to hydraulic use, whilst in 1899, part of the north stack was converted to allow for ice production and cold storage.\n\nBy the 1920s virtually all commercial shipping activity had ceased at the dock, although its warehouses did remain in use for the storage of goods transported by barge, road or rail. The onset of the Second World War in 1939 saw the Albert Dock being 'requisitioned' by the Admiralty and used as base for the British Atlantic fleet including submarines, small warships and landing craft. During the war the dock was struck on several occasions including a bombing raid in 1940 that damaged ships within it, and more destructively during the May Blitz of 1941 when German bombing caused extensive damage to the south west stack. By the end of the war almost 15% of the Albert Dock's floor space was out of use because of bomb damage.\n\nBy the time the Second World War had finished the Albert Dock's future looked bleak. The owners of the dock, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB) were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting an attitude of 'if it's not broke don't fix it, and if it is broke we still won't fix it'. At the same time a change in geo-political orientation towards Europe, coupled with the advent of containerisation meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the UK. Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I listed building status.\n\nDespite this recognition, the increasing debts of the MDHB meant that by the 1960s the company was eager to get rid of the Albert Dock. Having considered demolishing the buildings and redeveloping the land, the MDHB soon entered negotiations to sell the land to Oldham Estates, a property developer owned by Harry Hyams. Many plans for the site were developed including one that envisioned the development of a mini city that would provide 10m sq feet of letting space, hotels, restaurants, bars and underground parking in the drained dock basin. With the council reluctant to allow such a \"grandiose\" development to occur and with the huge public opposition to it (inspired at least in part by the work of Quentin Hughes), Oldham Estates were forced into scaling-down the plan and so in 1970 returned with a new vision known as 'Aquarius City', which had as its centrepiece a 44-storey skyscraper. Once again the plan failed to develop and no sooner had it been announced, than the MDHB's financial problems reached crisis point, Oldham Estates withdrew their deposit and the whole scheme fell through.\nWith the MDHB on the verge of bankruptcy a decision was taken to shut down and sell off the whole of the south docks system. The warehouses were emptied and in 1972 the Albert Dock finally closed down. The Brunswick Dock gates, which separated the South Docks system from the River Mersey, were opened allowing tidal movements in and the process of the clogging up the docks with sewage polluted silt began. In many senses just as the Albert Dock's development had symbolised the prosperity in the Liverpool at the time of its construction, its subsequent decline after the Second World War symbolised the collapse of the local economy as a whole.\n\nThroughout the early 1970s plans continued to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock site and the whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.\n\nThe creation of Merseyside County Council (MCC) in 1974 brought new hope that the Albert Dock could be redeveloped, with the MCC placing a high priority on its development. They soon entered negotiations with the MDHC and in 1979 eventually negotiated a deal to take over the running of the south docks. Despite this seeming step forward political wrangling between the MDHC (the dock owners), Liverpool City Council (the local planning authority) and Merseyside County Council (the group now responsible for redeveloping the docks) continued to hinder any development plans. Fed up with the in fighting the newly elected Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher decided that the city was incapable of handling regeneration initiatives itself and under the guidance of the 'Minister for Merseyside' Michael Heseltine, set up the Merseyside Development Corporation in 1981 to take over the responsibility of regenerating and redeveloping Liverpool's south docks.\n\nThe creation of the Merseyside Development Corporation (MDC) in 1981 was part of a new initiative launched by the then Conservative government that earmarked the regeneration of some of Liverpool's south docks, by using public sector investment to create infrastructure within an area that could then in turn be used to attract private sector investment. Thus the MDC was not directly responsible for regeneration programmes but rather acted as a spearhead, guiding the development process. Upon its formation it immediately created an initial strategy for the area placing a high priority on restoring those buildings that could be restored & demolishing the rest, restoring a water regime within the dock system (including the removal of up to of silt) and general environmental landscaping. As part of the strategy two flagship schemes were set up: the redevelopment of a site in Otterspool for the International Garden Festival and the regeneration of the Albert Dock.\n\nIn 1982 the MDC entered into negotiations with London-based developers Arrowcroft in order to secure much needed private sector investment. On a visit to the site, Arrowcroft's chairman Leonard Eppel spoke of how the buildings \"talked to him\" and upon his return to London set about persuading the company's board to take on the project. In September 1983 a deal was signed between Arrowcroft plc and the MDC leading to the creation of the Albert Dock Company, which could now start the process of regenerating the Albert Dock.\nOne of the first priorities of the regeneration was the restoration of the dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac Construction to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.\n\nDevelopment within the Albert Dock was rapid and the newly renovated Edward Pavilion (formerly north east stack) was ready in time for the 1984 Cutty Sark Tall Ship Race. The race was a big success for the city with over one million visitors into Liverpool over a period of four days, of which 160,000 visited the Albert Dock. In total it is estimated that the two flagship regeneration schemes of the MDC, the tall ships race and International Garden Festival, attracted over 3.5 million visitors to Liverpool in 1984. Also completed in 1984 was the renovation of the dock traffic office, which was fitted out and leased to Granada Television.\n\nSpurred by the success of the tall ships race and the International Garden Festival, Arrowcroft pushed on with the Albert Dock's renovation. With the Edward Pavilion refurbishment a success soon the company started on the Britannia and Atlantic pavilions (formerly the south and south east stacks), the latter of which required major structural repairs because of bomb damage it received during World War II. In 1986 the Merseyside Maritime Museum completed its move into the Albert Dock, having moved some exhibitions into the building in 1984. The museum, developed by Merseyside County Council had previously been located in the pilotage building and a salvage shed nearby. Also in 1986 work began on the largest of the dock warehouses, the Colonnades (formerly west stack). Ground floor shops were created with office space on the mezzanine level and apartments on the remaining floors. The first 37 of these apartments were completed by 1988 and the speed with which they sold was likened to 'sales day at Harrods'.\n\nThe Albert Dock was officially re-opened in 1988 by The Prince of Wales, the great-great-great-grandson of Prince Albert, the man who had originally opened the docks. It was timed to coincide with the opening of the newly finished Tate Liverpool, which was dubbed the 'Tate of the north' and at the time the only one outside London. The decision to locate a Tate gallery in Liverpool was seen as a major success for the city, as it made Liverpool home to the National Collection of modern art in the North of England.\n\nIn 1988 ITV's new morning television show \"This Morning\", hosted by Richard and Judy, began broadcasting from a studio inside the Albert Dock. As part of the show weather presenter Fred Talbot used a floating map of the British Isles to report the forecast. Two years later in 1990 The Beatles Story museum opened, the only Beatles themed visitor attraction in Britain, providing yet another draw to the Albert Dock.\n\nThroughout the 1990s development continued including a new hotel and the conversion of vacant space for use by larger companies such as Telewest (Now Virgin Media). Finally in 2003, some 22 years after the renovation of the Albert Dock started, the last remaining undeveloped space was brought into use with the opening of a new Premier Lodge hotel in the Britannia Pavilion.\n\nIn lieu of the dock's 175 anniversary in 2021, the owners of the dock applied for a royal charter. At a event at Tate Liverpool on 6th June 2018 the royal charter was handed over. The dock will be formally known as Royal Albert Dock Liverpool to avoid confusion with the Royal Albert Dock in London.\n\nWhen it was constructed the Albert Dock was considered a state of the art docking system. Built almost entirely from cast iron, stone and brick, the Albert Dock was designed to be fireproof, and on completion was the world's first non-combustible warehouse system. It provided of warehouse space and its dock basin had a water area of . In its construction over 23 million bricks were used and 47,000 tonnes of mortar. In total it cost £782,265 (approximately £41m today), whilst today its estimated to be worth £230 million.\n\nThe building's design complements many existing construction techniques with, what were considered at the time, radical solutions. The warehouses are supported by large load-bearing walls that range from being thick at the base to on the fourth level. One of the most advanced architectural features is the use of stressed skin roofing, which at the time of construction was virtually unheard of. Huge iron trusses are crossed with rivetted and galvanised wrought iron plates, creating a shape similar to an upturned boat hull that acts to support the roof above. The floors in the warehouses are supported by large iron columns and the spaces between were considered 'highly flexible', as new windows, stairwells and lift shafts could be added without risk to the building's structural integrity.\nThe advanced design stretches far beyond what can be seen from the ground. The structures are free from wood, but their foundations contain 13,729 piles of timber, which would stretch for in length if laid end to end. Such heavily supportive foundations were needed because the construction land was reclaimed from the River Mersey to build on. Given the 'quicksand' nature of the Mersey's tidal silt the piles were needed to provide maximum stability. The resultant effect of the dock being constructed where it was is that the north and west stacks (now Merseyside Maritime Museum and Colonnades) rise and fall with every tide.\n\nOne of the most notable features of the Albert Dock are the huge cast iron columns that line the quayside. At high and almost in circumference, the columns are based upon the Greek Doric style of architecture. Hartley's decision to use cast iron was an economic one as at the time it was cheaper than granite. Nonetheless, because of the huge dock walls that were built, the Albert Dock's construction required so much granite that the dock trustee's had to open their own mine in Kirkcudbrightshire in Scotland. The quality of the build materials used as well as the docks sheer size are considered a strong illustration of the great prosperity that the Port of Liverpool afforded the city at the time and the building's style is described as cyclopean classicism.\n\nToday the Albert Dock is one of Liverpool's most important tourist attractions and a vital component of the city's UNESCO world heritage Maritime Mercantile City. As well as being the number one tourist attraction in Liverpool, the Albert Dock is also the most visited multi-use attraction in the United Kingdom outside London, with in excess of four million visitors per year. Amongst the many attractions at the Albert Dock are the Merseyside Maritime Museum, the Beatles Story and the Tate Liverpool. There are also two hotels within the Albert Dock: a Holiday Inn and Premier Inn both located in the Britannia Pavilion. All the five warehouses around the dock, referred to as A, B, C, D and E, are Grade I listed buildings. Also listed Grade I is the former dock traffic office. Other buildings around the dock are listed Grade II; they are the former hydraulic pumping station, and the swing bridge leading from the dock towards the Pierhead.\n\nIn the aftermath of the dock's regeneration in the 1980s a policy had been adopted to try to attract retailers into the newly created premises within. However, after many years of struggling to compete with other major shopping areas in the city, the Albert Dock Company Ltd announced in 2007 a shift into attracting more bars and restaurants. As of 2008, bars and restaurants resident in the Albert Dock include Panam Bar & Restaurant, Revolution Bar, Spice Lounge, and Whats Cooking?\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "571630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=571630", "title": "Venus figurines", "text": "Venus figurines\n\nA Venus figurine is any Upper Paleolithic statuette portraying a woman, with fewer images depicting men or figures of uncertain sex, and those in relief or engraved on rock or stones are often discussed together. Most have been unearthed in Europe, but others have been found as far away as Siberia, extending their distribution across much of Eurasia, although with many gaps, such as the Mediterranean outside Italy.\n\nMost of them date from the Gravettian period (26,000–21,000 years ago), but examples exist as early as the Venus of Hohle Fels, which dates back at least 35,000 years to the Aurignacian, and as late as the Venus of Monruz, from about 11,000 years ago in the Magdalenian. These figurines were carved from soft stone (such as steatite, calcite or limestone), bone or ivory, or formed of clay and fired. The latter are among the oldest ceramics known. In total, some 144 such figurines are known; virtually all of modest size, between 3 cm and 40 cm or more in height. They are some of the earliest works of prehistoric art.\n\nMost of them have small heads, wide hips, and legs that taper to a point. Various figurines exaggerate the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva, although many do not, and the concentration in popular accounts on those that do reflects modern preoccupations rather than the range of actual artefacts. In contrast, arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless. Depictions of hairstyles can be detailed, and especially in Siberian examples, clothing or tattoos may be indicated.\n\nThe original cultural meaning and purpose of these artifacts is not known. It has frequently been suggested that they may have served a ritual or symbolic function. There are widely varying and speculative interpretations of their use or meaning: they have been seen as religious figures, as erotic art or sex aids, grandmother goddesses or as self-depictions by female artists.\n\nThe expression 'Venus' was first used in the mid-nineteenth century by the Marquis de Vibraye, who discovered an important ivory figurine and named it \"La Vénus impudique\" or \"Venus Impudica\" (\"immodest Venus\"), contrasting it to the \"Venus Pudica\", Hellenistic sculpture by Praxiteles showing Aphrodite covering her naked pubis with her right hand.\n\nThe use of the name is metaphorical as there is no link between the figurines and the Roman goddess Venus, although they have been interpreted as representations of a primordial female goddess. The term has been criticised for being more a reflection of modern western ideas than reflecting the beliefs of the sculptures' original owners, but the name has persisted.\n\n\"Vénus impudique\", the figurine that gave the whole class its name, was the very first Paleolithic sculptural representation of a woman discovered in modern times. It was found in about 1864 by Paul Hurault, 8th Marquis de Vibraye at the famous archaeological site of Laugerie-Basse in the Vézère valley (one of the many important Stone Age sites in and around the commune of Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil in Dordogne, southwestern France). The Magdalenian \"Venus\" from Laugerie-Basse is headless, footless, armless but with a strongly incised vaginal opening.\n\nFour years later, Salomon Reinach published an article about a group of steatite figurines from the caves of Balzi Rossi. The famous Venus of Willendorf was excavated in 1908 in a loess deposit in the Danube valley, Austria. Since then, hundreds of similar figurines have been discovered from the Pyrenees to the plains of Siberia. They are collectively described as \"Venus figurines\" in reference to the Roman goddess of beauty, Venus, since the prehistorians of the early 20th century assumed they represented an ancient ideal of beauty. Early discourse on \"Venus figurines\" was preoccupied with identifying the race being represented and the steatopygous fascination of Saartjie Baartman, the \"Hottentot Venus\" exhibited as a living ethnographic curiosity to connoisseurs in Paris early in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn September 2008, archaeologists from the University of Tübingen discovered a 6 cm figurine woman carved from a mammoth's tusk, the Venus of Hohle Fels, dated to at least 35,000 years ago, representing the earliest known sculpture of this type, and the earliest known work of figurative art altogether. The ivory carving, found in six fragments in Germany's Hohle Fels cave, represents the typical features of Venus figurines, including the swollen belly, wide-set thighs, and large breasts.\n\nThe majority of the Venus figurines appear to be depictions of women, many of which follow certain artistic conventions, on the lines of schematisation and stylisation. Most of them are roughly lozenge-shaped, with two tapering terminals at top (head) and bottom (legs) and the widest point in the middle (hips/belly). In some examples, certain parts of the human anatomy are exaggerated: abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, vulva. In contrast, other anatomical details are neglected or absent, especially arms and feet. The heads are often of relatively small size and devoid of detail. Some may represent pregnant women, while others show no such signs. It has been suggested that aspects of the typical depiction and perspective, such as the large and often pendulous breasts, emphasis on the upper rather than lower buttocks, and lack of feet and faces, support the theory that these are self-portraits by women without access to mirrors, looking at their own bodies. The absence of feet has led to suggestions that the figures might have been made to stand upright by inserting the legs into the ground like a peg.\n\nThe high amount of fat around the buttocks of some of the figurines has led to numerous interpretations. The issue was first raised by Édouard Piette, excavator of the Brassempouy figure and of several other examples from the Pyrenees. Some authors saw this feature as the depiction of an actual physical property, resembling (but \"not\" depicting) the Khoisan tribe of southern Africa, while others interpreted it as a symbol of fertility and abundance.\n\nRecently, similar figurines with protruding buttocks from the prehistoric Jōmon period Japan were also interpreted as steatopygia of local women, possibly under nutritional stress. (c.f.Jōmon Venus)\n\nThe Venus of Willendorf and the Venus of Laussel bear traces of having been externally covered in red ochre. The significance of this is not clear, but is normally assumed to be religious or ritual in nature—perhaps symbolic of the blood of menstruation or childbirth. Some buried human bodies were similarly covered, and the colour may just represent life.\n\nAll generally accepted Paleolithic female figurines are from the Upper Palaeolithic. Although they were originally mostly considered Aurignacian, the majority are now associated with the Gravettian and Solutrean. In these periods, the more rotund figurines are predominant. During the Magdalenian, the forms become finer with more detail; conventional stylization also develops.\n\nA number of attempts to subdivide or classify the figurines have been made. One of the less controversial is that by Henri Delporte, simply based on geographic provenance. He distinguishes:\n\nAccording to André Leroi-Gourhan, there are cultural connections between all these groups. He states that certain anatomical details suggest a shared Oriental origin, followed by a westward diffusion.\n\nThere are many interpretations of the figurines, often based on little argument or fact.\n\nLike many prehistoric artifacts, the cultural meaning of these figures may never be known. Archaeologists speculate, however, that they may be emblems of security and success, fertility icons, or direct representations of a mother goddess. The female figures, as part of Upper Palaeolithic portable art, appear to have no practical use in the context of subsistence. They are mostly discovered in settlement contexts, both in open-air sites and caves; burial contexts are much rarer.\n\nAt Gagarino in Russia, seven Venus figurines were found in a hut of 5 m diameter; they have been interpreted as apotropaic amulets, connected with the occupants of the dwelling. At Mal'ta, near Lake Baikal in Siberia, figurines are only known from the left sides of huts. The figurines were probably not hidden or secret amulets, but rather were displayed to be seen by all (a factor that may explain their wide geographic spread). An image of excess weight may have symbolized a yearning for plenty and security.\n\nHelen Benigni argues in \"The Emergence of the Goddess\" that the consistency in design of these featureless, large-breasted, often pregnant figures throughout a wide region and over a long period of time suggests they represent an archetype of a female Supreme Creator. Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age people likely connected the female as a creator innately tied to the cycles of nature: women were commonly believed to give birth and their menstrual cycles aligned with lunar cycles and tides.\n\nSome scholars and popular theorists suggest a direct continuity between the Palaeolithic female figurines and later examples of female depictions from the Neolithic or even the Bronze Age. Such views have been contested on numerous grounds, not least the general absence of such depictions during the intervening Mesolithic.\n\nA female figurine which has 'no practical use and is portable' and has the common elements of a Venus figurine (a strong accent or exaggeration of female sex linked traits, and the lack of complete lower limbs) may be considered to be a Venus figurine, even if from after the main Palaeolithic period. Figurines which match this definition, apart from date, have been found in the Neolithic and into the Bronze Age. The period and location that a figurine came from will contribute to the opinion of a given archeologist, such that ceramic figurines from the late ceramic Neolithic may be accepted as Venus figurines, while stone figurines from later periods are not. This is a matter of ongoing debate given the strong similarity between many figurines from the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and beyond. A reworked endocast of a brachiopod from around 6000 BC in Norway has been identified as a late Venus figurine. \n\nThis means that a given female figurine may or may not be classified as a Venus figure by any given archeologist, regardless of its date, though most archaeologists disqualify figurines which date from after the Paleolithic, even though their purpose could have been the same. For instance, the Mehrgarh figurine has all of the common characteristics of a venus stone figurine, including large breasts and incomplete legs, however it came from what is now Pakistan and also dates to 3000 BCE, which lies after the beginning of the Bronze Age.\n\n\n\n"}

Because Wǔ Xíng painting techniques are associated foremost with consciousness and overcoming corporeal restraints, it is common to speak of the manifest art therapy influence of this method.\n\nBecause the philosophical, and technical components of this type of painting have been taken from Chinese culture, it is common to hear it referred to as “Chinese Wǔ Xíng painting”.\n\nWǔ Xíng painting has a total of five brush strokes, five movements, and five types of composition, corresponding to the elements “Wood”, “Fire”, “Earth”, “Metal”, and “Water”.\n\nWǔ Xíng painting is metaphysics. Through Wǔ Xíng painting one can create a picture identical in its external appearance to any example of traditional Chinese painting. In this regard there is no difference between Wǔ Xíng painting and Chinese painting. Still, if one compares Wǔ Xíng painting and Guo Hua there are a number of differences in technique:\nTraditional Guo Hua painting is divided into several genres: mountains and water, birds and branches, grass and insects, etc. and does not usually extend beyond these genres. Wǔ Xíng painting is not tied to any genres. Using the five brush strokes the artist can paint everything that he wants.\nTraditional Chinese Guo Hua painting inherited an attachment to rice paper and silk as well as to a certain type of paint, while Wǔ Xíng has no such limitations.\n\nThe single most important thing for the artist who practices Wǔ Xíng painting is an attractive image harmoniously constructed using the Wǔ Xíng system.

Its most famous version was written in Persian language by Jami (1414-1492), in his Haft Awrang (\"Seven Thrones\"). The story has by then many elaborations, and is capable of a Sufi interpretation, where Zulaikha's longing for Yusuf represents the soul's quest for God.\n\nOther writers to have retold the story include: Mahmud Gami (Kashmiri). It is a standard tale used in Punjabi Qisse.\n\nThere exists as well a long poem on the subject, titled as Yusuf and Zalikha, which used to be attributed to Ferdowsi, the great Persian poet of the tenth and eleventh century, however, the scholars have rejected this book based on its low quality and the time line of Ferdowsi's life.\n\nAs in many other Muslim countries, the narrative of the epic love of Yousuf and Zulaikha was covered in classic literary works of East Bengal (modern day Bangladesh): in the 14th century A.D.
