In 1989, Bellettini created the landmark MTV television series, \"House of Style\". The series, originally hosted by supermodel Cindy Crawford, brought together fashion, modeling, music and pop culture. Bellettini produced the original run of the series, which aired on MTV for 78 episodes from 1989 to 2000.\n\n\"House of Style\", which brought together fashion and music, debuted on MTV in 1989. In an interview for the 2012 MTV oral history book, \"\"I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution\",\" Belletini recalled her original vision for the series, \"I wanted to do a show about music and fashion because I loved fashion, and at the time, MTV was driven by music.\" Her other objective, in her role as show's creator and producer, was to \"democratize\" fashion by making it more accessible to average viewers. She later spoke of her vision for the show, \"I just felt like I had to have a viewer in mind. I thought that the Midwest girl was really the person that I wanted to appeal to.\"\n\nBellettini was born on October 1, 1954, in Napa, California. She began her career at a radio station before joining the staff of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine.\n\nIn September 1988, Bellettini was hired by MTV News as a segment producer. MTV, which had only launched in 1981, was still a relatively young cable network at that point, but had become a strong influencer of pop culture. One of Bellettini's first assignments at MTV News was to interview the Beastie Boys, which Bellettini recalled in 2012, \"They said, “Go interview the Beastie Boys.” It was so much fun–they poured beer on my head.\"\n\nSoon after Bellettini joined MTV, a network's executive, Doug Herzog, announced that MTV News would start covering fashion, in addition to its existing coverage of the music industry. Bellettini, who had been promoted to news writer, was a logical choice to write the copy for fashion stories in the small news department, \"I was always stylish. And the two other writers in the news department, one was a Rastafarian and the other was reading Hitler books all the time.\" However, Kurt Loder, the main on-camera anchor at MTV News, was deeply uncomfortable with his new role covering the fashion. Bellettini recalled in the 2012 interview for \"I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution\", recalled the awkward on-air transitions between music and fashion news, \"Kurt Loder was our main news anchor, and fashion stories had to come out of Kurt’s mouth. He was not comfortable doing it. The look on his face, going from a Guns N’ Roses story to a fashion story–he looked like he was about to die.\"\n\nBellettini and other staffers soon received a memo from MTV's then-chief executive, Tom Freston, questioning why Kurt Loder was reporting fashion news. Bellettini read Freston's memo and conceived the idea of a new show focused on fashion, \"That night, I wrote up a paragraph saying we should do a show about style.\" Doug Herzog replied to the proposal within 24 hours, granting Bellettini a budget for the new show. Herzog also told her that she needed to find a new host. Bellettini's first suggested Johnny Rotten, the former lead vocalist of the Sex Pistols, as host. However, Rotten was unavailable for the show.\n\nHerzog told Bellettini is find an alternative host, since they could not get Rotten. He suggested that she read fashion magazines to find a possible host, since the proposed show was focused on fashion. Bellettini, who had never read fashion magazines before, but noticed that the major models of the time were being called supermodels. She wanted a potential host who was firmly rooted in the fashion industry, but could also attract male viewers. Bellettini decided on Cindy Crawford, a pick supported by Herzog, who had noticed her in his wife's magazines. However, Crawford's manager and modeling agency both said no to MTV's offer to have Crawford host the show. Crawford later explained her manager's reluctance to accept the offer, \"My agents thought it was a waste of my time. I was making so much money modeling, per day, why take away from that? Other than Elsa Klensch on CNN, there was no fashion on TV. Look at how much TV has changed since then. Now, of course, an agent would say, \"Yes, you should do it. And you should do a blog.\"\n\nUndaunted, Bellettini asked Crawford's representatives to Crawford call her directly about the hosting offer. Cindy Crawford called Bellettini back and immediately agreed to host the show for free, as there was no budget for Crawford's salary.\n\nHouse of Style debuted in May 1989 to high ratings. Herzog high-fived Bellettini once news of the ratings reached MTV's offices.\n\nBellettini remained the producer of \"House of Style\" during its original run from May 1989 until 2000. The show had an immediate effect on youth and popular culture. \"House of Style\" is credited with transforming Cindy Crawford's career, \"Especially before the days of social media, it gave me an opportunity for people to know me as a person and not just in two dimensions,\" she later noted in 2012. Bellettini also supported the career of designer Todd Oldham, by having him host regularly segment known as \"Todd Time\" during the 1990s. \"House of Style\" profiled designers, models and other figures within the industry that may have been little known to average Americans, with the goal of \"democratizing fashion\", including Naomi Campbell, Anna Sui and Marc Jacobs during their early careers. Bellettini also recruited musicians and other celebrities to appear with Crawford during its early years, including Nick Rhodes, Onyx, and Will Smith.\n\n\"House of Style\" ran for 78 episodes during its original run. Cindy Crawford remained the show's host for the series' first six years. She was succeeded by a string of guest hosts after Crawford's departure, including Rebecca Romijn, Amber Valletta and Molly Sims. \"House of Style\" was ultimately trimmed down from a weekly series to an annual special before its cancellation in 2000.\n\nBellettini was also involved in other television projects, including \"Fox/MTV Guide to Summer '92\" as a segment producer.\n\nA documentary on the history of the show and its cultural impact, \"House of Style: Music, Models and MTV\", aired on MTV on August 7, 2012. Bellettini, Crawford, Herzog and other important figures from \"House of Style\" appeared on the documentary. \"House of Style\" was relaunched online by MTV in 2012 and 2014.\n\nMost recently, Bellettini had been focusing on a beauty blog.\n\nAlisa Bellettini died in her sleep at her sister's home in Sacramento, California, on February 16, 2016, at the age of 61.\n"}
{"id": "12744475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12744475", "title": "Amma Asante", "text": "Amma Asante\n\nAmma Asante is a British Ghanaian filmmaker, screenwriter, and former actress, who was born in South London and raised in Streatham, London, on 13 September, 1969. Growing up, her Ghanaian mother was an entrepreneur who owned her own African cosmetics and grocery store. Her father, also Ghanaian, was a trained accountant who later received qualifications to work in the United Kingdom. Her love for the film industry started when she received her first role in BBC’s \"Grange Hill\". Later, she was given the opportunity to travel to Washington, DC, for an anti-drugs campaign, where she met former First Lady Nancy Reagan. Before the early 2000’s, Asante wrote and produced the (BBC 2) series \"Brothers and Sisters\", starring David Oyelowo. She was a childhood friend of model Naomi Campbell, whom she met when they were seven years old. \n\nAsante attended the \"Barbara Speake Stage School\" in Acton, London, where she trained in dance and drama. She appeared in the \"Just Say No\" campaign of the 1980s and was one of nine \"Grange Hill\" children to take it to the Reagan White House. She gained credits in other British television series, including \"Desmond's\" (Channel 4) and \"Birds of a Feather\" (BBC 1), and was a Children's Channel presenter for a year.\n\nAsante was previously married to producer Charlie Hanson. She is now married to Søren Pedersen, spokesman for European police in the Hague.\n\nAmma Asante’s career started when she first attended a performing arts school that allowed her to draft her first sitcom script. Later, she became a child actress and made her first appearances in \"Grange Hill\" and \"Desmonds\". In her late teens, Asante left acting and worked in screenwriting with a development deal from Chrysalis. She founded a production company, Tantrum Films, where she wrote and produced two series of the (BBC2) drama \"Brothers and Sisters\" (1998). \n\nAsante used Tantrum Films to make her directorial debut with a feature film, \"A Way of Life\" (2004). It was developed and financed through the UK Film Council and produced by Peter Edwards, Patrick Cassavetti and Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award winner Charlie Hanson. Her first film, \"A Way of Life\", focused on the life of a single mother, played by Stephanie James. It details the reality of a woman who recounts the suicidal death of her mother and the presence of foster care. It also introduces her brother Gavin, played by Nathan Jones, who was also taken into foster care. As a young seventeen-year-old, Leigh Anne (\"Stephanie James\"), finds it difficult to get by, especially due to the medical expenses that her daughter Eli Williams, incurred. It also touches on the theme of racism, with their neighbour Hassan Osman (played by Oliver Haden), who had been the victim of a beating, after being accused of reporting Leigh Anne to social services for child neglect. The film has been described as ‘one of the most warmly received UK titles in the London Film Festival in the autumn and a harrowing drama in social realist mode’. On 17 January 2005, the \"Times\" said, \"She is one of the most exciting prospects in British cinema to emerge in the past 12 months\".\n\nIn November 2004, the London Film Festival awarded Asante the inaugural Alfred Dunhill UK Film Talent Award. In February 2005 Asante was awarded \"The Times\"'s Breakthrough Artist of the Year and was nominated for Best Newcomer at both the \"Evening Standard\" and London Film Critics award ceremonies. That same month at the BAFTA Film Awards, Asante received the Carl Foreman Award for Special Achievement by a British Writer, director, or Producer in Their First Feature Film, which she has since cited as being a big break in her career. The 2005 Miami International Film Festival awarded \"A Way of Life\" as Best Dramatic Feature in World Cinema and the FIPRESCI prize (International Federation of Film Critics prize) for Best Feature Film. The Wales Chapter of BAFTA gave \"A Way of Life\" four of its top awards in April 2005, including Best Director and Best Film. Additionally, Asante was awarded for this film by the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain and the Mar del Plata Film Festival in Argentina.\n\nAsante has developed film projects in both the UK and US. Her second feature film, \"Belle\" (2013), is a sub-genre of both feminism and racism. The film is based on Dido Elizabeth Belle, and depicts an illegitimate mixed-race daughter of an enslaved African woman and a British navy captain. They placed the girl with his uncle (and Belle's great-uncle) Lord Mansfield and his wife in late 18th-century London. In this film, Dido was being raised by a white aristocratic family and acquired many intellectual skills. Dido uses her personal experiences to debate the social and structural issues of her time, like the patriarchy and lack of representation for visible minorities. Dido’s role in the film has been said to be “a way that is usually denied to historical black women”. The film touches on the Zong marine case, where the Captain falsely claims damages from his insurer for the loss of his 133 enslaved Africans. The Captain was not able to get compensated, so his case was escalated to the higher court, where Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, (Dido’s great-uncle and guardian), was in charge of. The film stars Academy Award nominees Tom Wilkinson as Lord Mansfield, who as a justice, ruled on two important cases related to slavery; Emily Watson as his wife and Miranda Richardson, alongside rising stars Sarah Gadon, Tom Felton, and Sam Reid, with Gugu Mbatha-Raw as the eponymous Dido Elizabeth Belle. \"Belle\" was the third project to receive investment from Pinewood Studios as part of its Pinewood Films initiative, established to help fund and support British independent films. The film was shot on location in the Isle of Man, London and Oxford. It was distributed through Fox Searchlight Pictures. On 19 September 2013, the \"Daily Mail\" reported that Asante was denied writing credit on the film, due to arbitration about contested credit by the Writers Guild of America. A special screening of the film was held at the United Nations headquarters in New York on 2 April 2014, as part of the UN commemorative events on slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. Asante and star Gugu Mbatha-Raw attended the screening at the United Nations headquarters. The same week, Asante was honoured by BAFTA in both Los Angeles and New York as a \"Brit to Watch\", where special screenings of \"Belle\" held to celebrate her work. At the 2014 Miami International Film Festival, Asante was awarded The Signis Award as director of \"Belle\". \n\nIn January 2014, it was announced that Asante would direct a thriller, \"Unforgettable\", for Warner Bros. She eventually left the project, announcing in March 2015 that she would instead be directing \"A United Kingdom;\" a period piece based on the romance between Seretse Khama and his wife Ruth Williams Khama. In 2016, Asante directed the film \"A United Kingdom\", and features David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike. Oyelowo and Pike served as the main protagonists in the film, who were an interracial couple in the British Empire of London. They received a lot of backlash for their union and were later forced to move from their home country, Bechuanaland (Botswana). \"A United Kingdom\" is based on the \"Colour Bar\" book, written by Susan William’s, and details the story of Prince Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams. Brunson Green details the filming process by explaining “you could tell there were about 250 movie moments in this biography of this amazing couple, and so we kind of culled through all those moments and tried to figure out a storyline”. During the IFP Gotham Independent Film Awards ceremony, Oyelowo mentions adding \"A United Kingdom\" to his list of movies, for being an African based story directed by a female filmmaker. In June 2016, the BFI announced that \"A United Kingdom\" would open the 60th London Film Festival.\n\nAsante was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to film.\n\nAsante is a past elected member of BAFTA Council and a past BAFTA Film committee member. In 2014 she was made an Honorary Associate of the London Film School where she earlier served as a Governor (2006–2007).\n\n\n"}

Also it was published in France by \"The différence\" in a bilingual edition and with translation by Gérard of Cortanze, that has been converted to French to Ernesto Cardinal, Roque Dalton, Juan Gelman and Vicente Huidobro. Protagonist of this erotic hymn —in addition to the author, of course— is the painter and French professor César Maurel (Paris, 1952), rooted in Costa Rica from 1981, with whom Istarú married at the beginning of this decade (he is also author of two poetry books: \"Zapping\", Editions Blue Dog, 2005 and \"rear Playground\", Germinal Publisher, 2012) and from whom years later would separate .\n\nThe critics point out that her poetry is loaded with eroticism —what has the controversy between readers—, ad at the same time has a perspective of gender, that is to say, that is very feminine. In it Istarú expresses without any fear the deepest feelings of the woman. “Filled with high erotic temperature sustained from beginning to end, expresses in a personal and strict vocabulary attaining in so difficult subject, a harmony of moving expression with a government infalible of the form”, said the jury of the Latin American Prize EDUCA based on the quoted book awarded.\n\nThe pieces of Istarú, always current, have been mounted not only in Costa Rica, but also in other countries of America, included the United States, and Europe. It suffices to say, for taking only one work, that \"pickled Men\", with its showing in Portugal, arrived in 2010 \"to his thirtieth fourth professional première abroad\".\n\nDirector María Bonilla, with the University Theatre, chose O\"ur Mother that are on the earth\" to inaugurate the 2010 season in Costa Rica, signaled related to this piece that treats four generations of women that have to confront the paper that society imposes them and the one who impose on themselves: “Women have to work on the construction of our identity, far from social conventions, of repressive education  that we have received and of the masculine perspective, all elements that are important and it is necessary to take into account, but that are not those that have to define us”. And Istarú comments: “I conceived it after doing a reflection on families that reiterate from generation to generation, and that many times the same women transmitted the sexist values that obey their conception of social patriarchy”.\n\nThe repertoire of Istarú as an actress of theater includes leading papers in classical and contemporary works. She has dabbled in cinema, exerting papers in Costa Rican films and TV shows (for example, in \"This they call home\") and also co-wrote with the director Esteban Ramírez the script of \"Caribbean\", film starred by the Cuban Jorge Perugorría and rewarded in festivals.\n\nHer work, the poetic as well as like dramatic, and her work as an actress have won several prizes. American and European anthologies have selected his poems, that have also have been translated to diverse languages, like  German, French, Dutch, English and Italian.\n\nAs of 2002, Istarú writes columns of opinion, in the weekly newspaper \"The Financial\" as well as in the Sunday magazine, Proa, of \"The Nation.\" In 2010 they were gathered in the book \"101 articles\", saying: “My style of writing does not look for the objectivity, is scandalously subjective with eagerness to seduce the reader with games of words, rhythms, but, especially, with ideas”.\n\n\n"}

They end up falling in love in the process and all seems to go well until months later when Mal abandons her lover just when Zoe's career starts to really take off. While it appears that Mal had little reason to leave her lover, the truth is that Mal was formerly an addict and is afraid that Zoe will leave her so she left Zoe before this could happen. The two end up being drawn back together when they're called back by Kara (Marina Rice Bader) to re-shoot their love scene.The two initially have a problem acting as both have pent-up feelings for each other however Anne Pasternak(Constance Brenneman) helps them to work professionally. Anne also comforts both Zoe and Mal individually and keeps their confidence afloat. Zoe gets a call from her agent who tells her that she should not have any shooting today. Zoe is then suspicious and calls out on Kara. Kara then reveals to Zoe that there is no broadcast deal and she did this to ensure Zoe and Mal got back together.

Zoe apologizes for what she said and tries to console her but Mal does not give in. Zoe then leaves and sits in the middle of the road. Mal then comes searching for her and the two end up staring at each other with tears in both of their eyes. \nThe scene then cuts the first 6 months which lead to the first scene where both Mal and Zoe fell in love with each other.\n\n\nAfterEllen gave \"Anatomy of a Love Seen\" a positive review, writing that \"As a director, Rice Bader has an eye for composition, and creates quite a few beautiful shots throughout the film.\" \"Curve\" also praised the film, writing \"\"Anatomy of a Love Seen\" is a powerful and poignant film.

The style combines certain fashionable tastes with the appearance of social respectability. The expression is sometimes shortened to \"BCBG\" (the fashion company BCBG Max Azria was named in reference to the subculture). \n\nParallels are often seen between this subculture and similar upper-class social groups in the United States (\"preppy\") and the United Kingdom (\"Sloane Rangers\"). As with those groups, BCBG drew mainstream attention during the 1980s. Thierry Mantoux published a handbook for BCBG style (\"BCBG - Le Guide du bon chic bon genre\") in the 1980s, a French equivalent to \"The Official Preppy Handbook\" and \"The Sloane Ranger Handbook\", both published earlier in the decade. \n\nThe BCBG social group is not to be confused with the \"bobo\" Paris fashion subculture (short for \"bohemian bourgeois\").\n\nThe style of BCBG tends towards the conservative and classic, to \"de-emphasize 'sexiness' and 'flashy' signs of wealth\", and is influenced by \"Anglo-Saxon\" styles. Some brands trendy with the BCBG group include Gucci, Max Mara, Le Bon Marché, and Chanel. \n\nThe BCBG social group is associated with certain residential areas in Paris and Versailles. BCBG are often identified with the \"NAP\" area formed by the triangle between Neuilly-Auteuil-Passy, from the 16th arrondissement to the Bois de Boulogne, as well as the 6th arrondissement closer to the centre of Paris, and the 7th and 8th arrondissements for shopping.\n\n"}

Concerts were also held in school halls and the Childers Street Hall of the Australian National University.\n\nWilfred Holland from England, with his strong conducting and performance background, led the orchestra for much of the 60’s. He also guided the Canberra Choral Society and the two organisations held joint performances of many early choral masterpieces.\n\nIn 1965 Ernest Llewellyn, former concertmaster of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra arrived in Canberra to take up the position of Director of the newly formed Canberra School of Music. He also was invited to the role of conductor of the Canberra Symphony. Llewellyn’s tremendous reputation made it possible for him to recruit top professional players to teach at the School and to join the orchestra. In no time the CSO was flourishing with sold-out performances at the newly opened Canberra Theatre.\n\nErnest Llewellyn continued to strengthen and extend the orchestra until his retirement in 1980, at which time the new School of Music auditorium was officially named Llewellyn Hall in his honour.\n\nThe CSO was lucky to secure Leonard Dommett as the new Conductor and Musical Director in 1982. As the former Concertmaster of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Dommett brought an impressive network of national and international artists to the CSO stage. Throughout the 80’s the orchestra continued to expand and artistic achievement was continually evolving.\n\nDommett retired in 1991 and the ensuing decade brought further change to the orchestra, including the implementation of fully professional status in 1994. Large opera gala concerts featured celebrity conductors such as Richard Bonynge and Isaiah Jackson.\n\nWhen Richard Gill joined the CSO as Chief Conductor and Artistic Director in 2001, the organisation was going through difficult times. He brought much needed consistency and stability to the orchestra – and within a couple of years after his arrival, the CSO was back on a solid financial footing.\n\nDr Nicholas Milton took up the baton as Chief Conductor and Artistic Director in 2007 and his passion, vision and expertise has inspired players and audiences alike. Milton is a rising Australian conductor now based in Germany who was also a former violinist with the Macquarie Trio. Also in 2007 the CSO received Commonwealth Government funding for the first time which has allowed for additional rehearsals and larger orchestras on stage.\n\nFor the Canberra Centenary season of 2013, the ACT Government enlisted the CSO to perform the World Premiere of a commissioned work by Andrew Schultz, \"Symphony No. 3 – Century\", as a feature of the official Canberra Day celebrations in March 2013.\n\n"}

After studies at the Academy of Arts in Sweden she went to France, at first to study and later to live and work at the artists' colony in Grez-sur-Loing where she met her husband William Blair Bruce. With him she returned to Sweden and together they created the artists estate Brucebo on Gotland, which was later established as a nature reserve. She also worked actively with the preservation of heritage buildings, women's right to vote and establishing the Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service.\n\nBenedicks, born on 28 October 1856 in Stockholm, was the daughter of Karolina Charlotta (born Cantzler) and Edward Otto Benedicks, wealthy owner of Gysinge, a part of Sandviken ironworks. Her brother, Gustaf Benedicks, inherited the iron works and was a member of the Swedish Riksdag. She also had a sister and two half-siblings from her father's second marriage. Her half-brother was physicist Carl Benedicks. There were many artists on her mother's side of the family: several of her uncles and her grandmother were painters, among them Johan Oscar Cantzler and Axel Leopold Cantzler. It was through them that Benedicks' artistry was cultivated and developed. She started at the August Malmström art school for women, and from 20August 1881 until the spring of 1885, she became the first female student in the sculpture class at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts.\n\nBenedicks met other female artists at the academy including Hilma af Klint and Gerda Rydberg with whom she travelled to France in 1883. Most of their time was spent in Paris and at the Swedish artist colony in Grez-sur-Loing. After completing her studies at the academy in Stockholm, she returned to France where she became the student of sculptor Alexandre Falguière. She also returned to Grez-sur-Loing, where many of the more prominent Scandinavian painters at the time would gather during the 1880s. Benedicks met with artists such as Carl Larsson and his wife Karin Bergöö Larsson, Bruno Liljefors, Christian Krohg and Peder Severin Krøyer. In Grez, the Swedish artists created their own, criticized \"salon\" called \"Le Salon des Opposants\".\n\nBeing a single female, with a good artistic education and coming from a wealthy family who encouraged her artistic aspirations, set Benedicks apart from the rest of the artists in the colony. At the time, this was a predominantly male environment, with artists of small means.\n\nBenedicks was foremost a sculptor, but she also worked with etchings and watercolors. Her sculptures are heavily influenced by the French style of the 1870s and 1880s, while her paintings and etchings are mostly landscapes and animals. Her works were exhibited for the first time at the Salon in Paris in 1899, where she participated with her sculpture \"L'obsédé\". She participated in the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900, where she was awarded a bronze medal, and later in Vienna.\n\nWhen making busts, Benedicks worked in marble and bronze. \"Michel Angelo\", a bronze bust, depicts Michelangelo as a thoughtful ordinary man working on something, rather than an exalted genius. She also made busts of P.A. Säve and sculptor Emil Wikström. Her study of the human anatomy resulted in a humoristic sculpture called \"Séance finie\" or \"The yawning\".\n\nSeveral of Benedicks' sculptures, aquarelles and sketches are still at Brucebo, for example \"L'obsédé\" (\"The Obsessed\"), \"Baigneur blessé\" (\"The wounded bather\") that won the \"Mention Honorable\" at the Salon in Paris in 1893.\n\nBenedicks met artist William Blair Bruce in France in the spring of 1885. Bruce was still a poor and unknown artist at the time, but a voyage back to Canada in the autumn that year, during which he lost most of his paintings in a shipwreck earned him some notoriety. Benedicks, accompanied by her uncle, made a surprise visit to Canada and Bruce shortly after. Following long discussions, the couple got engaged within a year, against the will of Benedicks' family. They returned to Europe in 1887, where they alternated between Stockholm and Paris. They got married in 1888, and visited Gotland for the first time that year. Theirs was one of many international marriages that came to be as a result of the mixed artist colony in Grez-sur-Loing. Another noted pair was the American painter Francis Brooks Chadwick and Swedish painter Emma Löwstädt-Chadwick. After the marriage the couple moved to Paris, probably to escape the scrutiny of the Benedicks family. For several years they lived a bohemian life and traveled around Europe to paint and study.\n\nIn 1899, Benedicks-Bruce and her husband decided to settle down on Gotland. They bought properties in Själsö at what was to become Brucebo, north of Visby, and started to rebuild and extend the houses on the estate. Benedicks-Bruce had the money for the project and Bruce was the chief architect. They moved to Brucebo in 1900. When Bruce died in 1906, she stayed on in Brucebo and continued with her work. The estate became a social hub for artists, musicians and scientists on Gotland, with Benedicks-Bruce as a generous hostess. She had three workshops at Brucebo and she also kept a number of animals on the estate, such as cows, horses, sheep, goats, dogs, chickens, parrots, monkeys, that she tended to herself. Her interest in self-sufficiency had started in Grez-sur-Loing, where many of the artists had small gardens where they grew their own vegetables, herbs, fruits and berries. She had great plans for the garden and even brought back seeds from France to plant, as well as hiring a gardener. However, the extension of buildings and other architectural improvements came to a halt with Bruce's death.\n\nShe lived at Brucebo until her death on 16 February 1935. She had no children to inherit from her, and in her will she stated that Brucebo should remain a place where young artists could stay and develop their artistry. In 1972, this was realized with the creation of the Brucebo Fine Art Scholarship Foundation.\n\nBenedicks-Bruce was a unique and strong woman for her time, engaged in political and social issues and has been called a Swedish \"Mrs. Pankhurst\". Among the things she fought for was the women's right to vote. When the Sixth Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance was held in Stockholm in 1911, she invited the delegates to Gotland. About 40 of them from Germany, England, Austria and Hungary accepted and came to Visby on 21June. She also worked with Gotlandic questions and was one of the most ardent advocates for the preservation of the \"Burmeisterska huset\", a 17th-century house in Visby. She was also a key figure in the establishment of the Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service on Gotland.\n\nIn 1911, she was a member of the Väskinde school council and a year later, part of the Väskinde Fruit Growers Association. In 1913, she became a member of the Väskinde Municipality Counsil. Benedicks-Bruce also made generous donations to the conservation of heritage buildings, childcare and orphanages.\n\n"}

Comic art is a form of visual expression defined by sequences of juxtaposed panels containing stylised images with bold outlines which incorporate text or symbols as an integral part of the narrative. Introduced by members of the British colonial elite, who were also amateur artists, cartooning and comic art was embraced by Burmese artists as a new mode of visual and critical expression. First appearing in the early 1910s, within two decades comics and cartoons emerged as a significant vehicle by which political and social criticism could be made within Burma's restricted public arena. As the number of print publications in Burma grew, from 22 in 1911 to 103 in 1921 and finally to over 200 by the close of the 1930s, comics became a substantial avenue for entertainment, art and discourse.\n\nThe first cartoon published in Burma appeared in the \"Rangoon Times\" in 1912. The cartoon was created by Martin Jones, the British commissioner of Burma's railways. It depicted a young Burmese woman who attended a Western party and was subsequently humiliated. Jones published the derogatory illustration under the pseudonym Myauk, the derivation of the Burmese term \"myauk phyu\" meaning ‘white monkey’. A term the Burmese used to refer to the British colonial forces who occupied Burma from 1824 to 1948.\n\nJones along with fellow amateur colonial painters physics professor Kenneth Ward and principal of St. Mathews High School in Moulmien E G N Kinch founded the Burma Art Club in 1913. Their efforts were assisted by Commissioner Hla Aung and his partner Mya May, along with several young Burmese artists including Ba Zaw, Ba Nyan, Tha Dun, Tun Hla, and Ba Kyi. Located on the grounds of the Rangoon Government High School, the Burma Art Club was a colonial art institution with the objective of promoting Western-style painting and drawing, including cartooning, to select Burmese students. It has been suggested by art historian Andrew Ranard that: Among the first initiates to receive training from the establishment were the now notable Burmese cartoonists Ba Gale, also known as Shwe Talay or Shwe Yoe, and Ba Gyan. It is considered that the beginning of Burma's comic art movement was defined by these individuals.\n\nBa Gale (1893-1945) was a formative figure in Burma's burgeoning comic art scene. His career began in 1915, after publishing a cartoon in the \"Rangoon College Annual Magazine\" at the age of 22. Crucially, he was the first artist to draw and publish a cartoon in the Burmese language, which appeared in \"Thuriya\", a publication run by young nationalists, in March 1917. Earning 10-15 kyat per cartoon (approximately AU $0.17) Ba Gale sought to make cartooning his career. His works subsequently appeared in the \"Rangoon Times\" and as part of the editorial pages in other smaller local newspapers.\n\nBa Gale's style drew heavily from the European tradition of caricature. During his time at the Burma Art Club, he was introduced to and subscribed to the British comic publication \"Punch\", known for its political and social satire. Despite being acknowledged as an adept artist and an astute pictorial commentator, the Burmese public initially found it difficult to understand and interpret Ba Gale's exaggerated and stylised drawing style. Writer and social historian Aung Zaw notes that: \n\nEven in its earliest stages, Burmese comic art was political. Despite being a regular fixture within the English-language periodicals that circulated throughout Burma, Ba Gale's works often parodied the British administration. However, he did not limit his critique to the colonialists. He also used comic art to critic prominent social issues such as opportunistic politicians and what he perceived as sycophantic behaviour towards the British. Considered one of Ba Gale's most famous cartoons is his portrayal of the 1917 resolution to forbid colonial forces from wearing shoes within the Shwedagon Pagoda; an act which was forbidden by Burmese religious custom. Ba Gale illustrated the portly colonialists, identified by their opulent Western dress, riding on the back of Burmese people like horses so that they did not have to obey the custom of removing their shoes within the Shwedagon. Ba Gale does not just lampoon the British and their disrespectful behaviour he also questions the attitudes of those Burmese people who assist them. Ba Gale, however, did not escape criticism entirely. A cartoon which depicted the leader of a 1930 peasant uprising as a hero earned him substantial condemnation from British officials, though he was never jailed. Towards the mid-1920s Ba Gale transitioned into filmmaking and acting where he gained significant popularity.\n\n The political inclination first seen in Ba Gale's work was furthered by his contemporary Ba Gyan (1902-1953) who rose to prominence in the 1930s with his bold cartoons and nationalist agenda. Ba Gyan, like Ba Gale, also trained at the Burma Art Club where he was singled-out by founder Martin Jones for his ‘talent, humour and desire to entertain.’ Ba Gyan's practice traversed a number of fields. In addition to working as an editorial cartoonist, he also illustrated children's magazines, worked as a commercial photographer, novelist and animator. Ba Gyan was instrumental in establishing the Burmese animation industry. In 1934 and 1935 he produced Burma's first animated films, \"Kye Taungwa\" and \"Athuya\" respectively. Previously, Burmese comic art had been restricted to single cartons or limited panel short stories, however, in 1937 Ba Gyan created Burma's first comic book, \"Ko Pyoo and Ma Pyone\". At this stage Ba Gyan also began to work with recurring characters whose antics would be developed and explored across the political and humour panels of several major publications.\n\nAfter Burma gained its independence in 1948, Ba Gyan's comic production became explicitly political and highly critical. Of particular significance was a cartoon which appeared in a local newspaper on January 4, 1948. The comic depicted British General Sir Hubert Rance departing Burma, waving goodbye to a local family as he tells them ‘Take care of your children.’ Behind the amicable scene are three children each symbolising a damage caused by the Second World War: debt, destruction and economic crisis. Ba Gyan's use of metaphor as a communicative device shows a growing sophistication and maturing in Burma's comic art movement. Gallerist and collector Aung Soe Min claims that the cartoon's popularity stemmed from its ability to concisely express Burma's situation at the time.\n\nPost-independence Ba Gyan took a firmly partisan stance satirising both sides of Burma's new political regime; lampooning the Prime Minister U Nu and the opposing communist leader Thakin Than Tun. Aung Zaw notes that Ba Gyan's influence was respected and recognised by these figures. By the early 1950s Burma was embroiled in political turmoil and on the cusp of a civil war, in a bid to quell a social uprising Prime Minister U Nu sought a meeting with Ba Gyan asking him to only exhibit cartoons which exhibited peace and unity. Famously, he refused to compromise informing U Nu that he was too busy to attend the meeting. Ba Gyan, and other early cartoonists such as Hein Sung, viewed their role as ‘public watchdog’s’ who were responsible for keeping the Burma's independent power structures in check.\n\nThe proceeding period of development in Burma's comic art which spanned from the early 1950s until the military takeover of 1962 was an era of growth and experimentation in which younger artists expanded on the visual tradition established by Ba Gale and Ba Gyan. Without the competition of television, periodicals inundated with comics became one of the major sources of entertainment particularly for the younger generation. However, following the 1962 coup by the socialist, military leader Ne Win, Burma's comic art with its fundamental political basis languished under the strictures of the junta. Comic art stagnated until the 1970s when developments in the book publishing industry helped to revive the practice.\n\n"}
{"id": "49732154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49732154", "title": "Etruscan architecture", "text": "Etruscan architecture\n\nEtruscan architecture was created between about 700 BC and 200 BC, when the expanding civilization of ancient Rome finally absorbed Etruscan civilization. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood and other materials of temples, houses, tombs and city walls, as well as bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in anything like their original condition are tombs and walls, but through archaeology and other sources we have a good deal of information on what once existed.\n\nFrom about 630 BC, Etruscan architecture was heavily influenced by Greek architecture, which was itself developing through the same period. In turn it influenced Roman architecture, which in its early centuries can be considered as just a regional variation of Etruscan architecture. But increasingly, from about 200 BC, the Romans looked directly to Greece for their styling, while sometimes retaining Etruscan shapes and purposes in their buildings.\n\nThe main monumental forms of Etruscan architecture, listed in decreasing order of the surviving remains, were: the houses of the wealthy elite, the mysterious \"monumental complexes\", temples, city walls, and rock-cut tombs. Apart from the podia of temples and some house foundations, only the walls and rock-cut tombs were mainly in stone, and have therefore often largely survived.\n\nThe early Etruscans seem to have worshipped in open air enclosures, marked off but not built over; sacrifices continued to be performed outside rather than inside temples in traditional Roman religion until its end. It was only around 600 BC, at the height of their civilization, that they began to create monumental temples, undoubtedly influenced by the Greeks That these buildings developed essentially from the largest types of Etruscan house has been both asserted and challenged.\n\nUsually, only the podium or base platform used stone, with the upper parts of wood and mud-brick, greatly reducing what survives for archaeologists. However, there is evidence for the portico columns sometimes using stone, as at Veii. This has left much about Etruscan temples uncertain. The only written account of significance on their architecture is by Vitruvius (died after 15 BC), writing some two centuries after the Etruscan civilization was absorbed by Rome. He describes how to plan a \"Tuscan temple\" that appears to be a Roman \"Etruscan-style\" (\"tuscanicae dispositiones\") temple of a type perhaps still sometimes built in his own day, rather than a really historically-minded attempt to describe original Etruscan buildings, though he may well have seen examples of these.\n\nMany aspects of his description fit what archaeologists can demonstrate, but others do not. It is in any case clear that Etruscan temples could take a number of forms, and also varied over the 400-year period during which they were being made. Nonetheless Vitruvius remains the inevitable starting point for a description, and a contrast of Etruscan temples with their Greek and Roman equivalents. There are also a few model temples in pottery, and depictions on tombs or vases. Remains of the architectural terracotta elements sometimes survive in considerable quantities, and museums, mostly in Italy, have good collections of attractively shaped and painted antefixes in particular.\n\nVitruvius specifies three doors and three cellae, one for each of the main Etruscan deities, but archaeological remains do not suggest this was normal, though it is found. Roman sources were in the habit of ascribing to the Etruscans a taste for triads in things such as city planning (with three gates to cities, for example), in ways that do not seem to reflect reality. The orientation of the temple is not consistent, and may have been determined by a priest watching the flight of birds at the time of foundation.\n\nThe exteriors of both Greek and Roman temples were originally highly decorated and colourful, especially in the entablature and roofs, and this was if anything even more true of Etruscan temples. When wood was used for columns, the bases and capitals were often encased in painted terracotta. All the edges of the roof were decorated, mostly in brightly painted terracotta, and there seem often to have been a row of sculptures along the central ridge of the roof, going beyond the acroterion group above a pediment in Greek and Roman temples. The Apollo of Veii was part of an acroterion group. Substantial but broken remains of late sculptured pediment groups survive in museums, in fact rather more than from Greek or Roman temples, partly because the terracotta was not capable of \"recycling\" as marble was. The groups from Luni and Talamone (both now in Florence) are among the most impressive.\n\nFeatures shared by typical Etruscan and Roman temples, and contrasting with Greek ones, begin with a strongly frontal approach, with great emphasis on the front facade, less on the sides, and very little on the back. The podia are also usually higher, and can only be entered at a section of the front, just presenting a blank platform wall elsewhere. There may only be columns at the front portico. In Etruscan temples, more than Roman ones, the portico is deep, often representing, as Vitruvius recommends, half of the area under the roof, with multiple rows of columns.\n\nAt least in later temples, versions of Greek Aeolic, Ionic and Corinthian capitals are found, as well as the main Tuscan order, a simpler version of the Doric, but the attention to the full Greek detailing in the entablature that the Romans pursued seems to have been lacking. Fluted Tuscan/Doric columns can also be found, against Greek and later Roman conventions.\n\nEtruscan architecture shared with Ancient Egyptian architecture the use of large cavetto mouldings as a cornice, though not on the same massive scale. The cavetto took the place of the Greek cymatium in many temples, often painted with vertical \"tongue\" patterns (as in the reconstructed Etruscan temple at Villa Giulia, illustrated above), and combined with the distinctive \"Etruscan round moulding\", often painted with scales. \n\nThe first building of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill was the oldest large temple in Rome, dedicated to the Capitoline Triad consisting of Jupiter and his companion deities, Juno and Minerva, and had a cathedral-like position in the official religion of Rome. Its first version was traditionally dedicated in 509 BC, but in 83 BC it was destroyed by fire, and the rebuilt Greek-style temple completed in 69 BC (there were to be two more fires and new buildings). For the first temple Etruscan specialists were brought in for various aspects of the building, including making and painting the extensive terracotta elements of the entablature or upper parts, such as antefixes. But for the second building they were summoned from Greece.\n\nThe first version is the largest Etruscan temple recorded, and much larger than other Roman temples for centuries after. However, its size remains heavily disputed by specialists; based on an ancient visitor it has been claimed to have been almost , not far short of the largest Greek temples. Whatever its size, its influence on other early Roman temples was significant and long-lasting. Reconstructions usually show very wide eaves, and a wide colonnade stretching down the sides, though not round the back wall as it would have done in a Greek temple. A crude image on a coin of 78 BC shows only four columns, and a very busy roofline.\n\n\"Monumental complex\" or building is a term used for a few large sets of buildings relatively recently uncovered by archaeology, the term reflecting a lack of certainty over their function. The two leading examples are \"the Archaic building\" at Poggio Civitate and another at Acquarossa (Zone F); both are 6th-century or earlier. Both have sets of buildings round a courtyard, which use stone, at least in the foundations, roof tiles, and elaborate decorations in architectural terracotta. Their size is exceptional for their early date. One obvious possible function is as palatial dwellings; another is as civic buildings, acting as places for assembly, and commemoration of aspects of the community. Only the stone foundations and ceramic fragments remain for excavations to discover.\n\nIt seems clear from the richer tombs that the Etruscan elite lived in fairly spacious comfort, but there is little evidence as to what their homes looked like, although some furniture is shown in tomb frescos. The rock-cut tomb chambers often form suites of \"rooms\", some quite large, which presumably resemble in part the atrium homes of the better-off Etruscans. Unlike several of the necropoli, Etruscan cities have generally been built over from the Romans onwards, and houses have left little trace. Where remains survive, there are tightly-packed tufa bases, with perhaps mud-brick above, but in some places the lower parts of tufa walls survive even in small houses. One complete set of foundations shows a house 7.9m by 3.9m (25 x 13 feet). At large farms, mines, quarries and perhaps other sites employing many people (many or mostly slaves), workers lived in dormitories.\nA form of models of houses in pottery, and sometimes bronze, called \"hut urns\" gives us some indications. These were apparently used to hold cremated ashes, and are found in the preceding Villanovan culture and early Etruscan burials, especially in northern areas. The hut urns show a conventional model with a single interior space. They are usually round or slightly oval, often with prominent wooden beams laid in two rows on the sloping roof, which cross at the central ridge and project some way in \"V\"s into the air; these projections seem to have been sometimes carved or otherwise decorated. The urns always have a large square-ish door for access, sometimes two, and the outline of windows in the walls may be indicated by ridges or marks in the clay. There is very often a window and exit for smoke, above the door in the roof, and at the opposite end.\n\nSuch houses were made of earth and organic materials, using mud brick and daub and wattle. Stone hearths and perhaps stone rings at the base are found. Even the well-off seem rarely to have lived in stone houses, and rock-cut tomb chambers often represent wooden ceilings in stone. The \"Tomb of the Reliefs\" at Banditaccia suggests that possessions such as tools and weapons were often hung from the walls for storage.\n\nOn the Palatine Hill in Rome, the Casa Romuli (\"House of Romulus\") was long preserved, and when necessary rebuilt as before. It was a hut made of wood posts and roof beams, wattle and daub walls and a thatched roof, and possibly typical of ordinary Etruscan housing outside crowded city centres. The site cannot be identified with certainty, but at one candidate location circle of six post-holes plus a central one have been found, cut into the tufa bedrock, with an ovoid 4.9m x 3.6m perimeter.\n\nRich Etruscans left elaborate tombs, mostly gathered in large necropoli some way outside their cities. These were generously filled with grave goods, especially ceramics, which give us most of our understanding of Etruscan culture. Typically, in the tufa regions of southern Etruria, the burial chamber was cut from solid rock below ground, which is relatively easy with this rock, but there was a structure above, often rather large. In other regions they are normally built up above ground. They were reused for further burials in the same family over several generations, and would often have become very crowded with sarchophagi and grave-goods, though the known survivals have now been emptied, either by looters or archaeologists.\n\nSome tombs are stone buildings, often in rows, rather like small houses. Others are round tumuli with stone retaining walls, with steps down to rock-cut chambers below. Both types are found closely packed together in necropoli like Banditaccia and Monterozzi, the latter containing some 6,000 burials. Several different types of tombs have been identified, reflecting a development through time as well as differences in income. Some types clearly replicate aspects of the richer houses, with a number of connected chambers, columns with capitals, and rock-cut ceilings given beams. Many tombs had fresco paintings, which does not seem to have been a Greek influence (though the style of the paintings are certainly based on Greek art), as the Greeks had ceased to use chamber tombs well before the Etruscans started to paint theirs in about 600; the Egyptians had also ceased painting tombs by then.\n\nEtruscan cities, which often sat on hill-tops, became walled from about the 8th century, first in mud-brick, then often in stone. Even before the Romans began to swallow up Etruscan territory, Italy had frequent wars, and by the later period had Celtic enemies to the north, and an expanding Rome to the south. There was an agger or rampart and a \"fossa\" or ditch in front of the wall. The towns had a number of gates where roads entered, which were sometimes given arched gateways. The best survivor of these is the 2nd-century Porta Marzia at Perugia (illustrated above) from the end of the period. Here, as in many cases, surviving work comes from the period just around the Roman takeover, but appears to represent Etruscan traditions. By the 4th century, Volterra had two walls, the second enclosing the whole city.\n\nThe stonework is often of fine quality, sometimes using regular rectangular blocks in a rough ashlar, and sometimes \"cyclopeian\", using large polygonal blocks, partly shaped to fit each other, somewhat in the manner of the well-known Inca masonry, though not reaching that level of quality. Gaps are left, which are filled in with much smaller stones.\n\nSeveral important and unimportant Roman roads, such as the Via Cassia, overlie Etruscan precursors, but there are sufficient Etruscan sites that were neglected after their conquest to allow an understanding of the considerable Etruscan road system. Roads did not just run between cities, but out into the countryside to allow agricultural produce to be easily brought in. While not as heavily engineered as Roman roads, considerable efforts went into creating a road surface that on major routes could be as wide as 10.4 metres, on a 12 kilometre stretch connecting Cerveteri with its port Pyrgi, made in the 5th century. This had a gravel surface, between tufo edging-blocks, and a central drainage channel.\n\nThe Vie Cave, narrow cuttings often running deeply through hills, are probably little changed since Etruscan times. As well as connecting sites, these may have had a defensive function in times of war. Their construction may have mainly resulted from the wearing through soft tufo bedrock by iron-rimmed wheels, creating deep ruts that required the road to be frequently recut to a smooth surface. Their dating can only be deduced by that of settlements they pass between, and objects from tombs beside them. The 7th and 6th centuries show a move to replace earlier tracks only suitable for mules and pedestrians with wider and more engineered roads capable of taking wheeled vehicles, using gentler but longer routes through hilly country.\n\nBridges were common, though fords more so where these would suffice. Presumably many were in timber, but some at least used stone underneath a timber roadway.\n\n"}

In June, 2005, Avila created a website, Fedexfurniture.com, to display photographs of a couch, bed, dining room table, and desk that he had constructed out of cartons obtained from overnight shipping giant FedEx Corporation (FedEx). FedEx attorneys used the takedown provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to force Avila's ISP to take the site offline, accusing Avila of infringing on FedEx's copyrights and trademarks, breaching his contract with FedEx by using the cartons for purposes other than shipping, and potentially misleading consumers into believing that FedEx approved or endorsed Avila's actions. Among attorneys and activist organizations concerned with the exercise of First Amendment rights on the Internet, FedEx's actions raised questions about the constitutionality of using the DMCA to censor unwanted speech. The Fedexfurniture.com website is down as of July 8th, 2017.\n\nIn 2005, Avila moved to Tempe, Arizona with nothing more than clothes and work essentials. He was still stuck in a lease on his California apartment, and could barely afford his new apartment in Arizona.\n\nAfter a bit of frustration over not having furniture, Avila remembered that a former roommate had solved a similar problem by constructing furniture using FedEx cartons. Using hundreds of FedEx boxes and materials that he \"already had lying around\" for shipping various items, Avila constructed every piece of furniture in his apartment. Avila's designs were sturdy and attractive. Friends urged Avila to put pictures of the furniture on a Web site. According to Avila, he did so in order to show that trying financial circumstances need not lead to despair; one can respond creatively, even artistically, by using \"found\" materials. The site's message was \"It's OK to be ghetto\".\n\nThe site subsequently attracted widespread attention, both from Web surfers and the press. Because the site was getting so much traffic, Avila placed a PayPal donation link on the page and asked for help to pay for the bandwidth charges. He also announced a plan to sell Fedexfurniture.com T-shirts, although Avila says that no T-shirts were ever sold.\n\nOn June 27, 2005, FedEx attorneys wrote to Avila's ISP. Citing the takedown provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), they demanded that the ISP remove Avila's materials from the Web. They justified their request on two grounds:\n\nIn order to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA, Avila's ISP complied with the request and removed Avila's materials from the Web. Had the ISP not done so, it could have been held liable for contributory infringement (aiding and abetting the infringer) if Avila's materials were subsequently found to be infringing in a court of law.\n\nFedEx's actions concerned Internet free speech activist organizations, such as Stanford University's Center for Internet and Society, which are concerned about the use of the DMCA's takedown provisions to censor unwanted speech. According to these organizations, the DMCA's purpose is to prevent Internet copyright infringement; it was never Congress's intent that the DMCA's takedown provisions should be used when the real issue is trademark infringement or breach of contract.\n\nA Stanford attorney, Jennifer Granick, assisted Avila on a pro bono basis. In her letter to FedEx, she disputed the use of the DMCA to remove Avila's site from the Web; she argued that the company's claim of copyright infringement had no merit; therefore, FedEx should not have used the DMCA to silence Avila's speech. The company's underlying motivations, she argued, were to protect its trademark and ability to place restrictions on public use of its cartons. Avila restored his site briefly. The dispute attracted widespread press attention, and Avila was frequently interviewed to tell his side of the story. In response to Granick's letter, FedEx attorneys reiterated their claims. Subsequently, Avila removed his site from the Web, citing technical difficulties. By January 2006, Avila's site had returned, however, by June 30, 2006 the site had again disappeared. This was caused by a server crash, and as of July 27, 2006 it was back online, but as of August 16, 2007 the site is gone. It popped up again in October 2007, but is currently down (July 8, 2017).\n\n\n\n"}

A sequel to \"Goon\" (2011), the film stars Seann William Scott, Baruchel, Liev Schreiber, Alison Pill, Elisha Cuthbert, Wyatt Russell, Marc-André Grondin and Kim Coates.\n\nPrincipal photography began in Toronto on June 22, 2015. The film was released in Canada on March 17, 2017 and on September 1, 2017 in the United States.\n\nDuring a pro hockey lockout, Doug \"The Thug\" Glatt's (Seann William Scott) team, the Halifax Highlanders, has to contend with an influx of new players. With pro hockey suspended, media focus has descended on the lower league, and the owner of the Highlanders, Hyrum Cain (Callum Keith Rennie), seeks to capitalize on the attention. Before the opening game, Doug is made captain and leads his team out onto the ice. In a close fought game, Doug is goaded into a fight with the rival team's enforcer, Anders Cain (Wyatt Russell), an up-and-coming player with a violent streak, and the son of the Highlanders' owner. Anders wins the fight, and with Doug badly injured, the Highlanders lose the game. Dealing with rehab, Doug decides to retire and accept a more stable job as an insurance salesman. At home, Doug's wife Eva realizes that she is pregnant, and she and Doug make preparations for their new child. Without Doug, the Highlanders go on a long losing streak, prompting the owner to push for changes. He signs several overseas players and pushes to add his own son to the team. Hyrum foresees Anders as the new captain of the Highlanders, and although the coach disagrees with the move, anticipating locker room dysfunction, Hyrum strongarms him into making Anders the new captain. \n\nMeanwhile, Doug finds no joy in his new job, stuck in a dingy office, and he begins secretly training to get back into hockey. Doug visits his old rival, Ross \"The Boss\" Rhea, who has left hockey and now competes in a hockey fighting league, where he is the current champion. Doug convinces Ross to train him in southpaw fighting, as the injury he suffered fighting Anders has weakened his right arm. Ross agrees to train him, and Doug slowly begins to learn how to fight left-handed. Ross convinces Doug that if he joins the hockey fighting league and impresses, it could be a way to get back into minor league hockey. Doug takes Ross' advice, but the first fight ends up being a battle royale style brawl, instead of the one-on-one fights that Doug had witnessed before. Doug and Ross end up as the last two standing during the melee, but Ross is too hurt to continue and collapses before they can fight each other. In the locker room after the fight, Ross reveals that he has post-concussion syndrome, and doctors have recommended that he stop playing, as one more bad hit could cause a permanent injury.\n\nAt the same time, the Highlanders have improved with Anders as the captain, but not enough to get into playoff position. Anders' self-sabotaging play, in which he constantly is being penalized for fighting, has kept the Highlanders outside of a playoff spot. In addition, Anders' aggressive and violent attitudes towards his fellow players keeps the whole team on edge, and their play suffers as a result. During another losing effort, Anders grows frustrated and ends up knocking out the entire opposing team. He is promptly suspended, and the coach demands a change. Hyrum, having seen Doug at the hockey fighting league, suggests that they add Doug back to the roster, secretly hoping that his addition will push his son to play better. Before Doug's first game back, Eva makes Doug promise that he won't fight, concerned for him now that they're about to be parents. Doug reluctantly agrees, and the Highlanders narrowly win in Doug's celebrated return. The Highlanders go on a winning streak, but when Anders returns from suspension, he goads Doug into being more aggressive. Doug and Anders interrupt a game during a dispute, and they are both suspended for the next game. During the game's afterparty, Anders provokes Doug into a fight, and when Eva sees that Doug has been fighting again, she kicks him out of the house.\n\nMeanwhile, the Highlanders must win the last two games of the season to sneak into the playoffs. With Anders and Doug suspended, Hyrum decides to sign Ross, who has still been competing in the local hockey fighting league. To free up a spot, Hyrum terminates Anders' contract, fed up with his son's antics. While Ross helps the Highlanders to win the first of their last two games, Eva goes into labor, and Doug reconciles with her as they head to the hospital. After having her baby, Eva realizes that the same drive that led Doug to be with her during the birth, is the same drive that pushes him to want to defend his teammates on the ice, and she gives Doug her blessing to continue fighting. Having been kicked off the team, Anders rejoins his old team, as they will play the Highlanders in the last game of the season with a playoff spot on the line. The game is immediately chippy, with both Ross and Anders starting fights. As the game enters the third period with the game tied, Ross and Anders are involved in a scuffle, and Anders cheap shots Ross, checking him from behind into the boards. Ross is knocked unconscious, and while paramedics take him away on a stretcher, Doug enters the rink to fight Anders in retaliation.\n\nDoug uses his southpaw training to beat Anders, but when Doug shows mercy, Anders threatens Doug, claiming that he will never stop coming for him until they are both like Ross, being carried out on stretchers. Realizing that his new family is more important to him than hockey, Doug uses his weakened right arm to level Anders, but throws his arm out and has to be helped off the ice. Hyrum rushes to his son's aid, where Anders tells him that he hates hockey, and the two appear to mend things between them. Having been told earlier that further injury to his right arm would be career-ending, Doug realizes that his hockey days are behind him. He watches as the Highlanders win the game in the final seconds, and during the celebration, he sets his stick down and goes home.\n\n\nCurrent and former hockey players Tyler Seguin, Michael Del Zotto, Brandon Prust, George Parros, Colton Orr and Georges Laraque make appearances in the film.\n\nDoug \"The Hammer\" Smith, whom Doug Glatt is based on, has a cameo in the \"Bruised and Battered\" sequence. He is head-butted by Seann William Scott in the square-off between the two Dougs.\n\nOn September 24, 2012, it was announced that Jay Baruchel would be returning to write the sequel to \"Goon\" along with Jesse Chabot, while Michael Dowse was set to return to direct the film, and Evan Goldberg to produce. On May 15, 2015, it was announced that Baruchel would make his directorial debut on the film, titled \"Goon: Last of the Enforcers\", and would also return in the role of Pat, while Seann William Scott would also return to play the role of the hockey enforcer, Doug \"The Thug\" Glatt. Goldberg would be executive producer, while David Gross, Jesse Shapira, Jeff Arkuss and Andre Rouleau would be producers on the film. On June 8, 2015 Elisha Cuthbert joined the cast of the film along with the returning cast of Liev Schreiber and Alison Pill from the first film.\n\nOn June 10, 2015, the complete cast of the film was announced by Entertainment One, Wyatt Russell was set to play Anders Cain, a volatile young captain of the Halifax Highlanders, Marc-André Grondin to play a superstar Xavier LaFlamme, Kim Coates as Highlanders coach Ronnie Hortense, Pill would star as Glatt's love interest Eva and Schreiber as Ross \"The Boss\" Rhea, while Cuthbert would play Mary, the outlandish sister of Pill's character Eva, who is now married to Doug the Thug. In a tweet on July 7, 2015 from the set of the film, TSN's Sportscaster James Duthie revealed that he and T.J. Miller were cast to play the sportscasters in the film. On July 23, 2015, real NHL players Tyler Seguin and Michael Del Zotto were spotted on the set during filming along with Scott. On August 7, 2015, a tweet by Georges Laraque stated that he was headed to the set with Colton Orr and George Parros.\nPrincipal photography on the film began on June 22, 2015, in Toronto, Ontario. Baruchel also tweeted the photo of the cast from the set. Late-June, filming was taking place in Hamilton, Ontario's Corktown area, the Barrie Molson Centre in Barrie in July until August 13, 2015 and near Bayfront Park in Hamilton.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 44%, based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Seann William Scott remains as watchable as ever in the title role, but \"Goon: Last of the Enforcers\" repeats its predecessor's violent and profane formula to diminishing effect.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nBarry Hertz from \"The Globe and Mail\" gave the film 3 out of 4 and wrote \"Baruchel's sequel is everything Dowse's original film was, amped up a degree or three: The fights involving dim-bulb hero Doug (Seann William Scott) and his various rivals are bloodier, the locker-room talk is dirtier and the on-ice action is slicker. The unlikely project – how many made-in-Canada films spark a franchise? – doesn't quite reach the heights of the original film, which found surprising pathos in Doug's tale of sweet good guy to brutal goon. But it delivers on nearly every other scale, including standout performances from returning players Scott, Alison Pill and Liev Schreiber, as well as some bits of comic gold courtesy of series rookies Wyatt Russell, T.J. Miller and Jason Jones.\" \"Toronto Sun\" gave the film 3.5 out of 5, and stated \"Violent, crude and really funny, \"Goon: Last of The Enforcers\", works for the same reason the original Goon worked — you will love the characters.\" \"National Post\" gave the film a 1 out of 4.\n\n"}

{"id": "14478375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14478375", "title": "Indigenous intellectual property", "text": "Indigenous intellectual property\n\nIndigenous intellectual property is an umbrella legal term used in national and international forums to identify indigenous peoples' claims of intellectual property rights to protect specific cultural knowledge of their groups.\n\nIt is a concept that has developed out of predominantly western concepts of intellectual property law, and has most recently been promoted by the World Intellectual Property Organization, as part of a more general United Nations push to see the world's indigenous, intangible cultural heritage better valued and better protected against perceived, ongoing mistreatment.\n\nNation states across the world have experienced difficulties reconciling local indigenous laws and cultural norms with a predominantly western legal system, in many cases leaving indigenous peoples' individual and communal intellectual property rights largely unprotected. Therefore, international bodies such as the United Nations have become involved in the issue, making more specific declarations that intellectual property also includes cultural property such as historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, and performing arts in addition to artwork and literature.\n\nWhile a number of Native American and First Nations communities have issued tribal declarations over the past 35 years, in the lead up to and during the United Nations International Year for the World's Indigenous Peoples (1993) then during the following United Nations Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples (1995–2004) a number of conferences of both indigenous and non-indigenous specialists were held in different parts of the world, resulting in a number of unified declarations and statements identifying, explaining, refining, and defining 'indigenous intellectual property'.\n\nBefore ceremonies and ceremonial knowledge were affirmed as protected intellectual property by the U.N. General Assembly, smaller coalitions of Indigenous cultural leaders met to issue declarations about protection of ceremonial knowledge. In 1980, spiritual leaders of the Northern Cheyenne, Navajo, Hopi, Muskogee, Chippewa-Cree, Haudenosaunee and Lakota Nations met on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana, and issued a resolution that:\n\"These [non-Native] individuals are gathering non-Indian people as followers who believe they are receiving instructions of the original people. We, the Elders and our representatives sitting in Council, give warning to these non-Indian followers that it is our understanding this is not a proper process, that the authority to carry these sacred objects is given by the people...\"\n\nThe first international congress of the International Society of Ethnobiology involving anthropologists, biologists, chemists, sociologists, and indigenous peoples met at Belem, Brazil. They identified themselves collectively as 'ethnobiologists', and announced that (amongst other matters) since \"Indigenous cultures around the world are being disrupted and destroyed.\":\n\"Mechanisms [ought to] be established by which indigenous specialists are recognized as proper Authorities and are consulted in all programs affecting them, their resources and their environment\"\n\"\"Procedures must be developed to compensate native peoples for the utilization of their knowledge and their biological resources\"\"\n\nThe Kari-Oca Declaration and charter was first affirmed in Brazil in May 1992, and then re-affirmed in Indonesia, in June 2002. Ratifying the document were Indigenous peoples from the Americas, Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe and the Pacific who, at Kari-Oca Villages, united in one voice to collectively express their serious concern at the way the world was exploiting the natural resources upon which indigenous peoples depend.\n\nSpecific reference is made within the Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter to perceived abuses of indigenous people's intellectual and cultural properties. Under the heading,\"Culture, Science and Intellectual Property\", amongst other matters, it is asserted:\n\n\"99: The usurping of traditional medicines and knowledge from Indigenous peoples should be considered a crime against peoples...\"\n\"102: As creators and carriers of civilizations which have given and continue to share knowledge, experience, and values with humanity, we require that our right to intellectual and cultural properties be guaranteed and that mechanisms for each be in favour of our peoples...\"\n\"104: The protection, norms and mechanism of artistic and artisan creation of our peoples must be established and implemented in order to avoid plunder, plagiarism, undue exposure, and use...\"\n\nAt the Lakota Summit V, an international gathering of US and Canadian Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations, about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota unanimously passed a \"Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality.\" Representatives affirmed a zero-tolerance policy on the exploitation of Lakota, Dakota and Nakota ceremonial knowledge. \nWhereas \"we are conveners of an ongoing series of comprehensive forums on the abuse and exploitation of Lakota spirituality; and\"\nWhereas \"we represent the recognized Lakota leaders, traditional elders, and grassroots advocates of the Lakota people; and ... \"\nWhereas \"non-Indian charlatans and \"wannabes\" are selling books that promote systematic colonization of our Lakota spirituality; and \"\nWhereas \"this exponential exploitation of our Lakota spiritual traditions requires that we take immediate action to defend our most precious Lakota spirituality from further contamination, desecration and abuse; ...\" \n6. \"We urge traditional people, tribal leaders, and governing councils of all other Indian Nations, as well as all national Indian organizations, to join us in calling for an immediate end to this rampant exploitation of our respective American Indian sacred traditions by issuing statements denouncing such abuse; for it is not the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people alone whose spiritual practices are being systematically violated by non-Indians.\"\n7. \"We urge all our Indian brothers and sisters to act decisively and boldly in our present campaign to end the destruction of our sacred traditions, keeping in mind that our highest duty as Indian people: to preserve the purity of our precious traditions for future generations, so that our children and our children's children will survive and prosper in the sacred manner intended for each of our respective peoples by our Creator.\"\n\nOn 18 June 1993, 150 delegates from fourteen countries, including indigenous representatives from Japan (Ainu), Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, India, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Surinam, United States and Aotearoa (New Zealand) met at Whakatane (Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand). The assembly affirmed Indigenous peoples' knowledge is of benefit to all humanity; recognised Indigenous peoples are willing to offer their knowledge to all humanity provided their fundamental rights to define and control this knowledge is protected by the international community; insisted the first beneficiaries of Indigenous knowledge must be the direct Indigenous descendants of such knowledge; and declared all forms of exploitation of Indigenous knowledge must cease.\n\nUnder Section 2 of their declaration they specifically ask State, National and International Agencies to:\n\n\"2.1: Recognise that Indigenous peoples are the guardians of their customary knowledge and have the right to protect and control dissemination of that knowledge.\"\n\n\"2.2: Recognise that Indigenous peoples also have the right to create new knowledge based on cultural tradition\"\"\n\n\"2.3: Accept that the cultural and intellectual property rights of Indigenous peoples are vested with those who created them.\"\n\nThis declaration arose out of a meeting of Indigenous and non-Indigenous specialists, who, at Jingarrba, in north-eastern Australia, agreed Indigenous intellectual property rights are best determined from within the customary laws of the Indigenous groups' themselves. Within the declaration, Indigenous customary laws are (re)named 'Aboriginal common laws', and it is insisted these laws must be acknowledged and treated as equal to any other systems of law:\n\n\"...Indigenous Peoples and Nations reaffirm their right to define for themselves their own intellectual property, acknowledging...the uniqueness of their own particular heritage.\"\n\n\"...Indigenous Peoples and Nations...declare that we...are willing to share [our intellectual property] with all humanity provided that our fundamental rights to define and control this property are recognised by the international community...\"\n\n\"Aboriginal intellectual property, within Aboriginal Common Law, is an inherent, inalienable right which cannot be terminated, extinguished, or taken... Any use of the intellectual property of Aboriginal Nations and Peoples may only be done in accordance with Aboriginal Common Law, and any unauthorised use is strictly prohibited.\"\n\nA regional meeting was held at Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia where indigenous peoples from the South America's concerned about the way internationally prevailing intellectual property systems and regimes appeared to be favouring the appropriation of indigenous peoples' knowledge and resources for commercial purposes, agreed:\n\n\"For members of indigenous peoples, knowledge and determination of the use of resources are collective and intergenerational. No...individuals or communities, nor the Government, can sell or transfer ownership of [cultural] resources which are the property of the people and which each generation has an obligation to safeguard for the next.\"\n\n\"Work must be conducted on the design of a protection and recognition system which is in accordance with ..our own conception, and mechanisms must be developed .. which will prevent appropriation of our resources and knowledge.\"\n\n\"There must be appropriate mechanisms for maintaining and ensuring the right of Indigenous peoples to deny indiscriminate access to the [cultural] resources of our communities or peoples and making it possible to contest patents or other exclusive rights to what is essentially Indigenous.\"\n\nIndigenous people of Asia met at Tambunan, Sabah, East Malaysia, to assert rights of self-determination, and to express concern about, and fear of, the threat unfamiliar 'western' intellectual property rights systems may pose to them. It was agreed:\n\n\"For the Indigenous peoples of Asia, the intellectual property rights system is not only a very new concept but it is also very western...[W]ith [western style] intellectual property property rights, alien laws will be devised to exploit the Indigenous knowledge and [cultural] resources of the Indigenous peoples.\"\n\n\"The [western] intellectual property rights system and the (mis)appropriation of Indigenous knowledge without the prior knowledge and consent of Indigenous peoples evoke feelings of anger, or being cheated\"\n\n\"Indigenous peoples are not benefiting from the intellectual property rights system.

In particular participants:\n\n\"Reaffirme[d] that imperialism is perpetuated through [western] intellectual property rights systems...\"\n\n\"Declar[ed] Indigenous peoples are willing to share our knowledge with humanity provided we determine when, where and how it is used: at present the international system does not recognise or respect our past, present and potential contribution...\"\n\n\"Seek[s] repatriation of Indigenous peoples [cultural] resources already held in external collections, and seek[s] compensation and royalties from commercial developments resulting from these resources\"\n\n\"...encourage[s]...governments...to protest against any General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade provisions which facilitate the expropriation of Indigenous peoples' knowledge and resources...[to instead] incorporate the concerns of Indigenous peoples...into legislation...\"\n\n\"[Seek to] Strengthen the capacities of Indigenous peoples to maintain their oral traditions, and encourage initiatives by Indigenous peoples to record their knowledge .. according to their customary access procedures.\"\n\n\"Urge universities, churches, government, non-government organizations, and other institutions to reconsider their roles in the expropriation of Indigenous people's knowledge and resources and to assist in their return to their rightful owners.\"\n\nIndigenous people from around the world attended an international indigenous peoples' summit on sustainable development in Khoi-San Territory, Kimberley, South Africa, where they reaffirmed previous declarations and statements (above), and, amongst other matters, declared:\n\n\"Our traditional knowledge systems must be respected, promoted and protected; our collective intellectual property rights must be guaranteed and ensured. Our traditional knowledge is not in the public domain; it is collective, cultural and intellectual property protected under our customary law. Unauthorized use and misappropriation of traditional knowledge is theft.\"\n\nAt the United Nation's General Assembly's 61st session, on 13 September 2007, an overwhelming majority of members resolved to adopt the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Regarding the intellectual property rights of indigenous peoples, the General Assembly recognized \"..the urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of indigenous peoples which derive from their political, economic and social structures and from their cultures, spiritual traditions, histories and philosophies...;\" reaffirmed \"...that indigenous peoples possess collective rights which are indispensable for their existence, well-being and integral development as peoples...;\" and solemnly proclaimed as an agreed standard for member nations around the world:\n\nArticle 11: \"Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature.\"\n\"States shall provide redress through effective mechanisms, which may include restitution, developed in conjunction with indigenous peoples, with respect to their cultural, intellectual, religious and spiritual property taken without their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs.\"\n\nArticle 24: \"Indigenous peoples have the right to their traditional medicines and to maintain their health practices, including the conservation of their vital medicinal plants, animals and minerals...\"\n\nArticle 31: \"Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.\"\n\"In conjunction with indigenous peoples, States shall take effective measures to recognize and protect the exercise of these rights.\"\"\n\nTheory for intellectual property/privilege law is give creators temporary government monopoly for help creators earn their investments (patents and copyrights) but with idea after monopoly terminates everything becomes public domain for help create new innovation. Because of this theory, use intellectual property/privilege for control culture create many problems:\n\n• Most culture items are too old for patent or copyright. Additionally, often the author or creator unknown.\n\n• Registration is not filed and fees are not paid\n\n• Natural languages lie within the public domain\n\n• Art styles lie within the public domain\n\n• Properties of fauna and flora are scientific fact and their discovery and description can't have intellectual privilege for facts or information. Fauna and flora evolved, not created by humans.\n\n• Can't own culture, it belongs to every person that uses it. This causes problems with human rights like expression freedom and choice.\n\n• Cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions lie in the public domain.\n\n• Powerful indigenous cultures in Europa (English, Italianos, Russians, etc) and Asia (Hindustanis, Han Chinese, etc.) can reverse this and forbid indigenous people from their culture (modern medicine, science, mathematics, printing, combustion engines, computer, etc) and languages (like English, Chinese, Arabic, etc.) and religions (Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, etc.)\n\n• Indigenous people consume more outside culture than they can give\n\n• Intellectual property owners must pay maintenance fee (patents).\n\n• Proponents have not offered a solid concept of collective intellectual property rights, need a specific owner that can follow laws and must accept liability in courts.\n\n• Names of all groups are generic, can't protect name Maori, Apache more than English, or Thai, Chinese.\n\n• Intellectual property is an idea that belongs to European culture, therefore it fails to meet the needs of indigenous culture since it is too stuck up to see indigenous communities eye to eye and come to an understanding\n\n• People innovate around restrictions\n\n• May encourage use of stereotypes instead because outside people created them\n\n• Restricting culture helps it become lost \n\n• Use of intellectual property/privilege this encourages the move against cultural prostitution.\n\nThe phrase \"traditional cultural expressions\" is used by the World Intellectual Property Organization to refer to \"any form of artistic and literary expression in which traditional culture and knowledge are embodied. They are transmitted from one generation to the next, and include handmade textiles, paintings, stories, legends, ceremonies, music, songs, rhythms and dance.\"\n\nTraditional cultural expressions can include designs and styles, which means that applying traditional Western-style international copyright lawswhich apply to a specific work, rather than a stylecan be problematic. Indigenous customary law often treats such concepts differently, and may apply restrictions upon the use of underlying styles and concepts.\n\nSince the 1970s, Intertribal groups in North American have organized demonstrations against non-native use of Native American cultural elements; such as the sale of products and services allegedly derived from Indigenous knowledge:\n\n\"It is a very alarming trend. So alarming that it came to the attention of an international and intertribal group of medicine people and spiritual leaders called the Circle of Elders. They were highly concerned with these activities and during one of their gatherings addressed the issue by publishing a list of Plastic Shamans in \"Akwesasne Notes\", along with a plea for them to stop their exploitative activities. One of the best known Plastic Shamans, Lynn Andrews, has been picketed by the Native communities in New York, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seattle and other cities.\n\nThe 1993 Lakota Declaration of War (see above), urges people to identify instances where sacred traditions are being abused and to work toward stopping the abuse through demonstrations, boycotts, press coverage and direct intervention.\n\nSince the 19th century, Maori-style Hakas have been popularly-used by New Zealanders as a cheer at sporting events; especially for New Zealand national teams. Between 1998 and 2006, the Ngati Toa iwi attempted to trademark the Ka Mate haka and to forbid its use by commercial organisations without their permission. The Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand turned their claim down in 2006, since \"Ka Mate\" had achieved wide recognition in New Zealand and abroad as representing New Zealand as a whole and not a particular trader. In 2009, as a part of a wider settlement of grievances, the New Zealand government agreed to:\n\nHowever, a survey of nineteenth-century New Zealand newspapers found Ka Mate was used by tribes from other parts of New Zealand, and was generally described by them as being an ancient peacekeeping song, from eras long before its appropriation by the Ngati Toa chief Te Rauparaha. When Ngati Toa authorities were asked for evidence that Ka Mate was of Ngati Toa authorship, they were unable to provide any.\n\nIn 2001 a dispute concerning the popular LEGO toy-line \"Bionicle\" arose between Danish toymaker Lego Group and several Māori tribal groups (fronted by lawyer Maui Solomon) and members of the on-line discussion forum (Aotearoa Cafe). The Bionicle product line allegedly used many words appropriated from Māori language, imagery and folklore. The dispute ended in an amicable settlement. Initially Lego refused to withdraw the product, saying it had drawn the names from many cultures, but later agreed that it had taken the names from Māori and agreed to change certain names or spellings to help set the toy-line apart from the Māori legends. This did not prevent the many Bionicle users from continuing to use the disputed words, resulting in the popular Bionicle website BZPower coming under a denial-of-service attack for four days from an attacker using the name Kotiate.\n\nIn 2005 a New Zealander in Jerusalem discovered that the Phillip Morris cigarette company had started producing a brand of cigarette in Israel called the \"L & M Maori mix\". In 2006, the head of Phillip Morris, Louis Camilleri, issued an apology to Māori: \"We sincerely regret any discomfort that was caused to Māori people by our mistake and we won't be repeating it.\"\n\nIn 1994 certain Native American tribal organisations demanded that a number of museums remove certain materials from exhibition and access to the public. They cited the NAGPRA as the legal basis for their complaints. Their position was that they would only permit such uses, selectively. after permission was requested directly to them.\nVernon Masayesva, CEO of the Hopi Tribe, and a consortium of Apache tribes demanded a number of American museums end public exhibition of and access to materials from their tribal cultures; including images, text, ceremonies, music, songs, stories, symbols, beliefs, customs, ideas, concepts and ethnographic field-notes, feature films, historical works, and any other medium in which their culture may appear literally, imagined, expressed, parodied or embellished.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The Japodian burial urn art was a unique form of art influenced to a degree by the Situla art of northern Illyria and Italy and by Greek art. The urns represent one of the best Japodian figurative art forms.\n\nThe first urn was discovered in 1890 in the necropolis of Jezerina near Bihać. In this fragment the face of a warrior was presented with a helmet, a drinking horn on the right hand and with a spear on the left hand. Almost all of the scenes are linked with the cult of the dead. The urns are broken up in three fazes, grouped up chronologically. The earliest date from the 5th century BC and even probably from the start of the 4th century BC and depict figures related with those of the situla art. The Japodian artists which created the early urns were inspired by the situla art and took many motives from this art, but which transformed the images in order to suit their own tastes. From this the second faze was created but with a much smaller yield. The second faze is linked with Greek art. The third group dates from the Roman era and presents a highly developed form of Japodian art.\n"}

Sandel.\n\nThe work was written to accompany Sandel's famous \"Justice\" course at Harvard University which he has taught for more than thirty years and which has been offered online and in various TV summary versions. There is also an accompanying sourcebook of readings: \"Justice: A Reader\".\n\nSandel addresses a series of alternative theories of justice. The utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham is outlined and criticised and then John Stuart Mill's refinements are discussed. The libertarians, in particular Robert Nozick, and their arguments are discussed. Then Sandel discusses Immanuel Kant and his 'categorical imperative'. The discussion then goes on to John Rawls's work. Then Aristotle and the concept of 'telos' is discussed. It is here that Sandel begins to make clear his own perspective. He argues that justice, rather than being autonomous (as Kantians or Rawlsians might have it), has a goal. A form of communitarianism. Sandel quotes Alasdair MacIntyre and his characterisation of humans as being 'storytelling beings' who live their lives with \"narrative quests\".\n\nDespite the controversial and polarizing nature of the material, the reviews have largely been positive. \"The New York Times\" praised Sandel's ability to teach and says, \"If 'Justice' breaks no new philosophical ground, it succeeds at something perhaps no less important: in terms we can all understand, it confronts us with the concepts that lurk, so often unacknowledged, beneath our conflicts.\" \"The Guardian\" calls it a \"timely plea for us to desist from political bickering and see if we can have a sensible discussion about what sort of society we really want to live in.\" \"The Portsmouth Review\" calls it an \"enlightening read\".\n\n"}

Combattants wore full armour, and identified themselves by wearing their emblems on their shields. A herald (Old French \"heraut\", from a Frankish \"*hariwald\" \"commander of an army\") was an officer who would announce the competitors. \nThe display of heraldic emblems on shields is an innovation of the 12th century. The kite shields shown in the Bayeux Tapestry (c. 1070) sometimes show simple ornaments, but no heraldic emblems. Similarly, Frankish or German round shields of the 11th century (Ottonian, Salian) are sometimes depicted with simple geometric ornamentation, but not with figurative emblems.\nEarly mention of heraldic shields in Middle High German literature likewise dates to the 12th century.\n\nLions were used as heraldic emblems by Henry I of England (d. 1135), Henry \"the Lion\" (before 1146), and Alfonso VII of León (d. 1157) in the first half of the 12th century.\nThe oldest surviving heraldic seals are the equestrian seals (German: \"Reitersiegel\") used by high nobility in the second half of the 12th century. Among the oldest examples from the Holy Roman Empire, of what would develop into German heraldry, is the lion (or \"leopard\") of the Staufer coat of arms, first used before 1146 by Henry \"the Lion\", and in 1181 on the seal of Frederick VI of Swabia. Similar seals are known from England, the oldest being the equestrian seal of King Richard Lionheart of the House of Plantagenet, dated 1189, showing a heraldic lion design on the king's shield. His second seal, dated 1198, shows the three lions design which would subsequently become the royal coat of arms of England.\n\nThe earliest known colored heraldic representation appears on the funerary enamel of Geoffrey of Anjou (d. 1151), showing a coat of arms that appears to be the same as one later used by some of his descendants.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18426", "title": "Lithography", "text": "Lithography\n\nLithography () is a method of printing originally based on the immiscibility of oil and water. The printing is from a stone (lithographic limestone) or a metal plate with a smooth surface. It was invented in 1796 by German author and actor Alois Senefelder as a cheap method of publishing theatrical works. Lithography can be used to print text or artwork onto paper or other suitable material.\n\nLithography originally used an image drawn with oil, fat, or wax onto the surface of a smooth, level lithographic limestone plate. The stone was treated with a mixture of acid and gum arabic, \"etching\" the portions of the stone that were not protected by the grease-based image. When the stone was subsequently moistened, these etched areas retained water; an oil-based ink could then be applied and would be repelled by the water, sticking only to the original drawing. The ink would finally be transferred to a blank paper sheet, producing a printed page. This traditional technique is still used in some fine art printmaking applications.\n\nIn modern lithography, the image is made of a polymer coating applied to a flexible plastic or metal plate. The image can be printed directly from the plate (the orientation of the image is reversed), or it can be offset, by transferring the image onto a flexible sheet (rubber) for printing and publication.\n\nAs a printing technology, lithography is different from intaglio printing (gravure), wherein a plate is either engraved, etched, or stippled to score cavities to contain the printing ink; and woodblock printing or letterpress printing, wherein ink is applied to the raised surfaces of letters or images. Today, most types of high-volume books and magazines, especially when illustrated in colour, are printed with offset lithography, which has become the most common form of printing technology since the 1960s.\n\nThe related term \"photolithography\" refers to when photographic images are used in lithographic printing, whether these images are printed directly from a stone or from a metal plate, as in offset printing. \"Photolithography\" is used synonymously with \"offset printing\". The technique as well as the term were introduced in Europe in the 1850s. Beginning in the 1960s, photolithography has played an important role in the fabrication and mass production of integrated circuits in the microelectronics industry.\n\nLithography uses simple chemical processes to create an image. For instance, the positive part of an image is a water-repelling (\"hydrophobic\") substance, while the negative image would be water-retaining (\"hydrophilic\"). Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible printing ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image. This allows a flat print plate to be used, enabling much longer and more detailed print runs than the older physical methods of printing (e.g., intaglio printing, letterpress printing).\n\nLithography was invented by Alois Senefelder in the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1796. In the early days of lithography, a smooth piece of limestone was used (hence the name \"lithography\": \"lithos\" (λιθος) is the ancient Greek word for stone). After the oil-based image was put on the surface, a solution of gum arabic in water was applied, the gum sticking only to the non-oily surface. During printing, water adhered to the gum arabic surfaces and was repelled by the oily parts, while the oily ink used for printing did the opposite.\n\nLithography works because of the mutual repulsion of oil and water. The image is drawn on the surface of the print plate with a fat or oil-based medium (hydrophobic) such as a wax crayon, which may be pigmented to make the drawing visible. A wide range of oil-based media is available, but the durability of the image on the stone depends on the lipid content of the material being used, and its ability to withstand water and acid. After the drawing of the image, an aqueous solution of gum arabic, weakly acidified with nitric acid is applied to the stone. The function of this solution is to create a hydrophilic layer of calcium nitrate salt, , and gum arabic on all non-image surfaces. The gum solution penetrates into the pores of the stone, completely surrounding the original image with a hydrophilic layer that will not accept the printing ink. Using lithographic turpentine, the printer then removes any excess of the greasy drawing material, but a hydrophobic molecular film of it remains tightly bonded to the surface of the stone, rejecting the gum arabic and water, but ready to accept the oily ink.\n\nSenefelder had experimented during the early 19th century with multicolor lithography; in his 1819 book, he predicted that the process would eventually be perfected and used to reproduce paintings. Multi-color printing was introduced by a new process developed by Godefroy Engelmann (France) in 1837 known as chromolithography. A separate stone was used for each color, and a print went through the press separately for each stone. The main challenge was to keep the images aligned (\"in register\"). This method lent itself to images consisting of large areas of flat color, and resulted in the characteristic poster designs of this period.\n\n\"Lithography, or printing from soft stone, largely took the place of engraving in the production of English commercial maps after about 1852. It was a quick, cheap process and had been used to print British army maps during the Peninsula War. Most of the commercial maps of the second half of the 19th century were lithographed and unattractive, though accurate enough.\"\n\nHigh-volume lithography is used presently to produce posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging—just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it. Most books, indeed all types of high-volume text, are now printed using offset lithography.\n\nFor offset lithography, which depends on photographic processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates are used instead of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive emulsion. A photographic negative of the desired image is placed in contact with the emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created by direct laser imaging in a CTP (Computer-To-Plate) device known as a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. Non-image portions of the emulsion have traditionally been removed by a chemical process, though in recent times plates have come available that do not require such processing.\n\nThe plate is affixed to a cylinder on a printing press. Dampening rollers apply water, which covers the blank portions of the plate but is repelled by the emulsion of the image area. Hydrophobic ink, which is repelled by the water and only adheres to the emulsion of the image area, is then applied by the inking rollers.\n\nIf this image were transferred directly to paper, it would create a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet. Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber \"blanket\", which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or \"offset\" to the rubber blanket cylinder, this reproduction method is known as \"offset lithography\" or \"offset printing\".\n\nMany innovations and technical refinements have been made in printing processes and presses over the years, including the development of presses with multiple units (each containing one printing plate) that can print multi-color images in one pass on both sides of the sheet, and presses that accommodate continuous rolls (\"webs\") of paper, known as web presses. Another innovation was the continuous dampening system first introduced by Dahlgren, instead of the old method (conventional dampening) which is still used on older presses, using rollers covered with molleton (cloth) that absorbs the water. This increased control of the water flow to the plate and allowed for better ink and water balance. Current dampening systems include a \"delta effect or vario,\" which slows the roller in contact with the plate, thus creating a sweeping movement over the ink image to clean impurities known as \"hickies\".\n\nThe process of lithography printing is illustrated by this simplified diagram. This press is also called an ink pyramid because the ink is transferred through several layers of rollers with different purposes. Fast lithographic 'web' printing presses are commonly used in newspaper production.\n\nThe advent of desktop publishing made it possible for type and images to be modified easily on personal computers for eventual printing by desktop or commercial presses. The development of digital imagesetters enabled print shops to produce negatives for platemaking directly from digital input, skipping the intermediate step of photographing an actual page layout. The development of the digital platesetter during the late 20th century eliminated film negatives altogether by exposing printing plates directly from digital input, a process known as computer to plate printing.\n\nMicrolithography and nanolithography refer specifically to lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 micrometers are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 nanometers are considered nanolithographic. Photolithography is one of these methods, often applied to semiconductor manufacturing of microchips. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated photomask or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.\n\nAlthough photolithographic technology is the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example electron beam lithography, are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes as small as a few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of maskless lithography, in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a resist-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.\n\nIn addition to these commercially well-established techniques, a large number of promising microlithographic and nanolithographic technologies exist or are being developed, including nanoimprint lithography, interference lithography, X-ray lithography, extreme ultraviolet lithography, magnetolithography and scanning probe lithography. Some of these new techniques have been used successfully for small-scale commercial and important research applications.\nSurface-charge lithography, in fact Plasma desorption mass spectrometry can be directly patterned on polar dielectric crystals via pyroelectric effect, \nDiffraction lithography.\n\nDuring the first years of the 19th century, lithography had only a limited effect on printmaking, mainly because technical difficulties remained to be overcome. Germany was the main center of production in this period. Godefroy Engelmann, who moved his press from Mulhouse to Paris in 1816, largely succeeded in resolving the technical problems, and during the 1820s lithography was adopted by artists such as Delacroix and Géricault. After early experiments such as \"Specimens of Polyautography\" (1803), which had experimental works by a number of British artists including Benjamin West, Henry Fuseli, James Barry, Thomas Barker of Bath, Thomas Stothard, Henry Richard Greville, Richard Cooper, Henry Singleton, and William Henry Pyne, London also became a center, and some of Géricault's prints were in fact produced there. Goya in Bordeaux produced his last series of prints by lithography—\"The Bulls of Bordeaux\" of 1828. By the mid-century the initial enthusiasm had somewhat diminished in both countries, although the use of lithography was increasingly favored for commercial applications, which included the prints of Daumier, published in newspapers. Rodolphe Bresdin and Jean-François Millet also continued to practice the medium in France, and Adolf Menzel in Germany. In 1862 the publisher Cadart tried to initiate a portfolio of lithographs by various artists, which was not successful but included several prints by Manet. The revival began during the 1870s, especially in France with artists such as Odilon Redon, Henri Fantin-Latour and Degas producing much of their work in this manner. The need for strictly limited editions to maintain the price had now been realized, and the medium became more accepted.\nIn the 1890s, color lithography gained success in part by the emergence of Jules Chéret, known as the \"father of the modern poster\", whose work went on to inspire a new generation of poster designers and painters, most notably Toulouse-Lautrec, and former student of Chéret, Georges de Feure. By 1900 the medium in both color and monotone was an accepted part of printmaking.\n\nDuring the 20th century, a group of artists, including Braque, Calder, Chagall, Dufy, Léger, Matisse, Miró, and Picasso, rediscovered the largely undeveloped artform of lithography thanks to the Mourlot Studios, also known as \"Atelier Mourlot\", a Parisian printshop founded in 1852 by the Mourlot family. The Atelier Mourlot originally specialized in the printing of wallpaper; but it was transformed when the founder's grandson, Fernand Mourlot, invited a number of 20th-century artists to explore the complexities of fine art printing. Mourlot encouraged the painters to work directly on lithographic stones in order to create original artworks that could then be executed under the direction of master printers in small editions. The combination of modern artist and master printer resulted in lithographs that were used as posters to promote the artists' work.\n\nGrant Wood, George Bellows, Alphonse Mucha, Max Kahn, Pablo Picasso, Eleanor Coen, Jasper Johns, David Hockney, Susan Dorothea White and Robert Rauschenberg are a few of the artists who have produced most of their prints in the medium. M. C. Escher is considered a master of lithography, and many of his prints were created using this process. More than other printmaking techniques, printmakers in lithography still largely depend on access to good printers, and the development of the medium has been greatly influenced by when and where these have been established.\n\nAs a special form of lithography, the serilith process is sometimes used. Seriliths are mixed media original prints created in a process in which an artist uses the lithograph and serigraph processes. The separations for both processes are hand-drawn by the artist. The serilith technique is used primarily to create fine art limited print editions.\n\n\n"}

Built for actor James Hubert McVicker, the theater was the leading stage for comedic plays in Chicago's early years. It often hosted performances by Edwin Booth, who married McVicker's daughter and was once targeted there in an attempted murder. Adler & Sullivan designed a remodel in 1883. Although destroyed in two fires, including the Great Chicago Fire, McVicker's remained an operating theater until 1984. It was demolished the next year\n\nJames Hubert McVicker was born in New York City, New York on February 14, 1822. His father James died shortly after his birth, so he was raised by his mother Nancy and two siblings. He attended some public school before apprenticing as a printer when he was ten. For the next five years, he operated machines in New York printing houses. In October 1837, he was hired as an apprentice for the \"Republican\" in St. Louis, Missouri, and was named a journeyman three years later. However he found little enjoyment in the trade and he decided to acquire a classic education.\n\nIn 1843, he entered a production at the St. Charles Theater in New Orleans, Louisiana. McVicker traveled to various cities around the country to perform. In April 1848, he settled in Chicago, Illinois. The comedian who had worked at John Blake Rice's theater was just about to leave and Rice offered his position to McVicker. His first performance there was on May 2, 1848 in \"My Neighbor's Wife\". His wife also performed, starring in \"Hue and Cry\". McVicker starred opposite Rice's wife in \"Lend Me Five Shillings\" on April 27, 1849.\n\nTwo years after the death of Dan Marble, McVicker purchased the right to use his plays from the family estate. He went on a national tour and then toured England in 1855. The next year, McVicker became manager of the People's Theater in St. Louis. The playhouse was very successful and in March 1857 he used the proceeds to establish a new theater in Chicago. McVicker's Theater opened on November 5, 1857 featuring its own stock company performing the comedic plays \"Honeymoon\" and \"Rough Diamond\".\n\nEdwin Booth starred in \"A New Way to Pay Old Debts\" on May 31, 1858. He would later perform \"Richelieu\", \"Richard III\", and \"Brutus\" there, and he married one of McVicker's daughters in 1869. The theater was remodeled in 1864. James Henry Hackett performed as Falstaff in 1865. It was again extensively remodeled in August 1871, but was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire weeks later. However, it was rebuilt, and reopened on August 15, 1872. Mark Gray fired two bullets in an unsuccessful attempt to murder Edwin Booth on April 23, 1879 while the actor was performing \"Richard II\".\n\nActors who performed in McVicker's company over the years included James O'Neill and Robert B. Mantell. McVicker's was remodeled again in 1883 by Adler & Sullivan, but again destroyed in a fire in 1890. The rebuilt theater, designed by the same, opened on March 31, 1891 with a performance of \"The Rivals\" featuring Joseph Jefferson, William J. Florence, Louisa Lane Drew, and Viola Allen. McVicker died on March 7, 1896. His widow assumed management until she sold the theater to Jacob Litt on May 1, 1898. The theater was demolished and rebuilt in 1922. Balaban & Katz purchased the building in 1926. It later showed films until it was shut down in 1984. It was demolished the next year.\n\nThe theater's decor, interior design work, steelwork, terracotta and other features were designed by many of Chicago's leading firms including Structural steel work by Albert H. Wolf; mason work by William D. Price; carpentery by Thos. Clark & Sons; ventilation and galvanized iron work by Jas. A. Miller & Bro.; plumbing and electric light fixtures by E. Baggot; painting and decorating by Healy & Millet; carpets and draperies by Marshall Field & Co.; seating by A. H.

The curtains \"March Through Illinois\" and \"The Fort Dearborn Massacre\" were by Johannes Gelert; and the principal curtain, \"Chicago in 1833\", by Walter Burridge. The act drop curtain, \"Reverie of the Future\", was by Ernest Albert.\n\nMcVicker's Theatre in Chicago 1891\n"}
{"id": "20524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20524", "title": "Medieval fortification", "text": "Medieval fortification\n\nMedieval fortification refers to medieval military methods that cover the development of fortification construction and use in Europe, roughly from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the Renaissance. During this millennium, fortifications changed warfare, and in turn were modified to suit new tactics, weapons and siege techniques.\n\nTowers of medieval castles were usually made of stone or sometimes (but rarely) wood. Often toward the later part of the era they included battlements and arrow loops. Arrow loops were vertical slits in the wall through which archers inside shot arrows at the attackers, but made it extremely difficult for attackers to get many arrows back through at the defenders.\n\nAn exact nature of the walls of a medieval town or city would depend on the resources available for building them, the nature of the terrain, and the perceived threat. In northern Europe, early in the period, walls were likely to have been constructed of wood and proofed against small forces. Especially where stone was readily available for building, the wood will have been replaced by stone to a higher or lower standard of security. This would have been the pattern of events in the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw in England.\n\nIn many cases, the wall would have had an internal and an external \"pomoerium\". This was a strip of clear ground immediately adjacent the wall. The word is from the late medieval, derived from the classical Latin \"post murum\" (\"behind the wall\").\n\nAn external pomoerium, stripped of bushes and building, gave defenders a clear view of what was happening outside and an unobstructed field of shot. An internal pomoerium gave ready access to the rear of the curtain wall to facilitate movement of the garrison to a point of need. By the end of the sixteenth century, the word had developed further in common use, into \"pomery\".\nAlso by that time, the medieval walls were no longer secure against a serious threat from an army, as they were not designed to be strong enough to resist cannon fire. They were sometimes rebuilt, as at Berwick on Tweed, or retained for use against thieves and other threats of a lower order. Very elaborate and complex schemes for town defences were developed in the Netherlands and France, but these belong mainly to the post-medieval periods. By 1600, the medieval wall is likely to have been seen more as a platform for displaying hangings and the pomery as a gathering ground for spectators, or as a source of building stone and a site for its use, respectively. However, a few, such as those of Carcassonne and Dubrovnik, survived fairly well and have been restored to a nearly complete state.\n\nMedieval walls that were no longer adequate for defending were succeeded by the star fort. After the invention of the explosive shell, star forts became obsolete as well.\n\nHarbours or some sort of water access was often essential to the construction of medieval fortification. It was a direct route for trading and fortification. Having direct access to a body of water provided a route for resupply in times of war, an additional method of transportation in times of peace, and potential drinking water for a besieged castle or fortification. The concept of rivers or harbours coming directly up to the walls of fortifications was especially used by the English as they constructed castles throughout Wales.\nThere is evidence that harbours were fortified, with wooden structures in the water creating a semi-circle around the harbour, or jetties, as seen in an artists reconstruction of Hedeby, in Denmark, with an opening for ships to access the land. Usually, these wooden structures would have small bases at either end, creating a 'watch' and defense platform.\n\nReligion was a central part of the lives of medieval soldiers, and churches, chapels, monasteries, and other buildings of religious function were often included within the walls of any fortification, be it temporary or permanent. A place to conduct religious services was usually essential to the morale of the soldiers.\n\nMotte-and-bailey was the prevalent form of castle during 11th and 12th centuries. A courtyard (called a bailey) was protected by a ditch and a palisade (strong timber fence). Often the entrance was protected by a lifting bridge, a drawbridge or a timber gate tower. Inside the bailey were stables, workshops, and a chapel.\n\nThe motte was the final refuge in this type of castle. It was a raised earth mound, and varied considerably, with these mounds being 3 metres to 30 metres in height (10 feet to 100 feet), and from in diameter. There was a tower on top of the motte. In most cases, the tower was made of timber, though some were also made of stones. Stone towers were found in natural mounds, as artificial ones were not strong enough to support stone towers. Larger mottes had towers with many rooms, including the great hall. Smaller ones had only a watch tower.\n\nConstruction could sometimes take decades. The string of Welsh castles Edward I of England had built were an exception in that he focused much of the resources of his kingdom on their speedy construction. In addition to paid workers, forced levies of labourers put thousands of men on each site and shortened construction to a few years.\n\nNature could provide very effective natural defense for the castle. For this reason many castles were built on larger hills, cliffs, close to rivers, lakes or even caves.\n\nMaterials that were used in the building of castles varied through history. Wood was used for most castles until 1066. They were cheap and were quick to construct. The reason wood fell into disuse as a material is that it is quite flammable. Soon stone became more popular.\n\nStone castles took years to construct depending on the overall size of the castle. Stone was stronger and of course much more expensive than wood. Most stone had to be quarried miles away, and then brought to the building site. But with the invention of the cannon and gunpowder, castles soon lost their power.\n\nCosts for the walls depended on the material used. Wood would cost very little and was quick to build, but was weak. Stone was strong but very expensive and time-consuming to construct.\n\nManpower in the medieval era in Europe consisted mainly of serfs.\n\nThe height of walls varied widely by castle, but were often thick. They were usually topped with crenellation or parapets that offered protection to defenders. Some also featured machicolations (from the French \"machicoulis\", approximately \"neck-crusher\") which consisted of openings between a wall and a parapet, formed by corbelling out the latter, allowing defenders to throw stones, boiling water, and so forth, upon assailants below. Some castles featured additional inner walls, as additional fortifications from which to mount a defense if outer walls were breached.\n\nAny entrance through a wall, being an opening, forms an obvious weak point. To be practical, the entryway would have to accommodate supplies being brought through, yet difficult for attackers to breach. For example, passage over ditches or moats would have to be withdrawn to deny attackers. The use of multiple walls or ditches around an entrance would also make it difficult for defenders to use the entrance practically, necessitating better methods of control. Gates came in many forms, from the simple stone buttress and timber blocks, to the massive and imposing stone archways and thick wooden doors most associated with medieval citadels.\n\nA killing field was an area between the main wall and a secondary wall, so when the first wall was breached the attackers would run into the killing field to be confronted by another wall from which soldiers bombarded them. Soldiers would be positioned atop the second wall and armed with any variety of weapons, ranging from bows to crossbows to simple rocks.\n\nA moat was a common addition to medieval fortifications, and the principal purpose was to simply increase the effective height of the walls and to prevent digging under the walls. In many instances, natural water paths were used as moats, and often extended through ditches to surround as much of the fortification as possible. Provided this was not so unnaturally contrived as to allow an attacker to drain the system, it served two defensive purposes. It made approaching the curtain wall of the castle more difficult and the undermining of the wall virtually impossible. To position a castle on a small island was very favorable from a defensive point of view, although it made deliveries of supplies and building materials more cumbersome and expensive.\n\nA keep is a strong central tower which normally forms the heart of a castle. Often the keep is the most defended area of a castle, and as such may form the main habitation area for a noble or lord, or contain important stores such as the armoury or the main well.\n\nStairs were also constructed to contain trick or stumble steps. These were steps that had different rise height or tread depth from the rest and would cause anyone running up the stairs to stumble or fall, so slowing down the attackers' progress.\n\nA typical exterior wooden door might be made out of two layers of oak planks. The grain of the wood would run vertically on the front layer and horizontally on the back, like a simple form of plywood. The two layers would be held together by iron studs, and the structure might be strengthened and stiffened with iron bands.\n\nThe studs themselves were pointed on the front so that attackers would damage their weapons (swords, axes, etc.) while trying to break through.\n\nFrom the mid-15th century onwards, the power of cannons grew and medieval walls became obsolete as they were too thin to offer any realistic protection against prolonged bombardment. As a consequence of this, medieval walls were often upgraded with the addition of artillery platforms or bastions, and battlements were replaced by thick parapets with embrasures. In many cases, the medieval walls were dismantled and their stonework, which was still valuable as construction material, was reused in the construction of the new fortifications. The resulting space is often seen in old city centers of Europe even to this day, as broader streets often outline where the old wall once stood (evident for example in Prague and Florence, Italy).\n\nThe transition between medieval and early modern fortification can be seen in the fortifications of Rhodes in Greece and the fortifications of Famagusta in Cyprus.\n\nJust as modern military engineers enhance field fortifications with obstacles such as barbed wire, medieval engineers used a number of obstacle types including abatis, caltrops, cheval de frise, and trou de loup.\n\n\n\n"}

(stylized as mother!) is a 2017 American psychological horror film written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, and starring Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris, and Michelle Pfeiffer. The plot follows a young woman whose tranquil life with her husband at their country home is disrupted by the arrival of a mysterious couple.\n\n\"Mother!\" was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 74th Venice International Film Festival, and premiered there on September 5, 2017. It was released in the United States on September 15, 2017, by Paramount Pictures, and grossed $44 million worldwide against its $30 million budget. Although the film received generally positive reviews from critics, its biblical allegories and depiction of violence sparked controversy.\n\nIn the burnt-out remains of a large house, Him, an acclaimed poet struggling with writer's block, places a crystal object on a pedestal in his study. The ruined house morphs into a lovely home in an edenic landscape. In bed, Mother, the poet's wife and muse, awakens and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she starts seeing things that unsettle her, including visualizing a beating heart within its walls.\n\nOne day, Man turns up at the house, asking for a room. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. During his stay, Man suffers coughing fits and Mother observes an open wound in his side. Soon Man's wife, Woman, also arrives to stay. Mother is increasingly frustrated with her guests, but Him begs her to let them stay, telling Mother they are fans of his work and Man is dying. However, when Man and Woman accidentally shatter the crystal object, which Him had forbidden them to touch, Mother kicks them out and Him boards up his study.\n\nBefore Man and Woman can leave, their two sons arrive and fight over their father's will. The Oldest Son, who will be left with nothing, severely wounds his Younger Brother and flees. Him, Man, and Woman take the injured son for help. Alone in the house, Mother follows a trail of blood to find a tank of heating oil hidden behind the basement walls.\n\nUpon returning, Him informs Mother the son has died. Dozens of people arrive at the house to honor the dead son. They behave in rude and presumptuous ways that irritate Mother; she snaps when they break a sink, flooding the house. She orders everyone out and berates Him for allowing so many people inside while ignoring her needs. Their argument ends in passionate lovemaking.\n\nThe next morning, Mother announces she is pregnant. The news elates Him and inspires him to finish his work. Mother prepares for the arrival of their child and reads Him's beautiful new poem. Upon publication, it immediately sells out every copy. In celebration, Mother prepares a big dinner, but a group of fans arrives at the house before they can eat. She asks Him to send them away, but he insists he has to be polite and will return soon. Mother tries to lock the doors, but more fans arrive and enter the house to use the toilet. They start stealing things as souvenirs and damaging the house, but Him is oblivious due to the adulation he is receiving. Hundreds of people fill the house and an increasingly disoriented Mother watches it devolve into chaos. Military forces battle a cult of frenzied fans who tear rooms apart and engage in religious rituals. Amidst gunfire and explosions, the Herald, the poet's publicist, organizes mass executions.\n\nMother goes into labor and finds Him. He takes her to his study, which he reopens so she can give birth there. The havoc outside subsides. Him tells Mother his fans want to see their newborn son; she refuses and holds her son tightly. When she falls asleep, however, Him takes their child outside to the crowd, which passes the baby around wildly until his neck is inadvertently snapped. Mother wades into the crowd where she sees people eating her son's mutilated corpse. Furious, she calls them murderers and stabs them with a shard of glass. They turn on her, viciously beating and attempting to strangle her until Him intervenes. He implores Mother to forgive them, but she escapes, makes her way to the basement oil tank, and punctures it with a pipe wrench. Despite her husband's pleas, she sets the oil alight; it explodes, destroying the crowd, the house, and the surrounding environment.\n\nMother and Him survive; she is horrifically burned while Him is completely unscathed. He asks for her love and she agrees. He tears open her chest and removes her heart. As he crushes the heart with his hands, a new crystal object is revealed. He places it on its pedestal and, once again, the house is transformed from a burnt-out shell into a beautiful home. In bed, a new Mother appears and wakes up, wondering aloud where Him is.\n\nIn an interview, Lawrence said that the film is an allegory; she said that the film \"depicts the rape and torment of Mother Earth ... I represent Mother Earth; Javier, whose character is a poet, represents a form of God, a creator; Michelle Pfeiffer is an Eve to Ed Harris's Adam, there's Cain and Abel and the setting sometimes resembles the Garden of Eden\".\n\nAronofsky said that the exclamation mark in the title \"reflects the spirit of the film\" and corresponds to an \"exclamation point\" of the ending. The director discussed the film's unusual capitalisation in a Reddit interview, saying, \"To find out why there's a lowercase 'm', read the credits and look for the letter that isn't capitalised. Ask yourself what's another name for this character?\" The characters' names are all shown in lowercase, except for Him.\n\nThe lighter which appears throughout the film bears the Wendehorn, a symbol believed to represent \"the cooperation between nature's eternal laws, working in effect and in accordance with each other.\" One of the film's unexplained elements is the yellow powder Lawrence's character drinks, which \"The Daily Beast\" suggests is a reference to Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story \"The Yellow Wallpaper\".\n\nAfter 2014's \"Noah\", Aronofsky began working on a children's film. During that process, he came up with a new idea. He ended up writing the \"Mother!\" screenplay in five days, much faster than his usual pace. The film uses a dream-logic narrative, of which Aronofsky has noted, \"if you try to unscrew it, it kind of falls apart,\" and that \"it's a psychological freak-out. You shouldn't over-explain it.\"\n\nJennifer Lawrence was reportedly in talks to join the film by October 2015. By January 2016, Javier Bardem was also in talks to star, and by April Domhnall Gleeson, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ed Harris, and Brian Gleeson were added to the cast. In March 2016, it was announced Kristen Wiig had been cast in the film.\n\nShooting for the film began on June 13, 2016, and concluded on August 28, 2016. Prior to the start of principal photography, the cast rehearsed for three months in a warehouse, during which time Aronofsky was able to \"get a sense of movement and camera movement, and learn from that.\" During this time, Lawrence was relatively laid-back, and Aronofsky has said that as a result he \"didn't get to know the character until we started shooting, and she showed up.\"\n\n\"Mother!\" is the first Aronofsky film without composer Clint Mansell's involvement. The film originally had a score composed by Jóhann Jóhannsson, but after seeing the 90-minute score synced up with a rough cut of the film, Aronofsky and Jóhannsson agreed not to use the original score. They experimented with using the score at only a few moments, or instead using a new minimal score focused on sound design that incorporated noises into the soundscape of the house. Ultimately, they went with the second choice, and Jóhannsson's work merged with the sound design of Craig Henighan. Composer Ólafur Arnalds recounted the following story about the decision:\n\nOver its closing credits, the film features an a cappella Patti Smith cover of Skeeter Davis's \"The End of the World\".\n\nThe film was originally scheduled to be released on October 13, 2017, but was moved to September 15.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the 74th Venice International Film Festival, where it was selected to compete for the Golden Lion. The film premiered in London on 6 September 2017. It also screened at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nOn August 7, 2017, the first official trailer for the film was released.\n\n\"Mother!\" was released digitally on December 5, 2017, and was released on Blu-ray and DVD on December 19.\n\n\"Mother!\" grossed $17.8 million in the United States and Canada and $26.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $44.5 million, against a production budget of $30 million.\n\nIn North America, the film was released alongside \"American Assassin\" and was projected to gross $12–14 million from 2,368 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $700,000 from Thursday night previews and $3.1 million on its first day. It went on to open to just $7.5 million, finishing third at the box office and marking the worst debut for Lawrence in a film where she had top billing. Deadline Hollywood attributed the film's underperformance to its controversial narrative, misleading advertisements, and \"F\" CinemaScore grade. Other publications wrote that the film's CinemaScore grade, which is extremely rare, is associated with \"a movie that goes out of its way to artfully alienate or confuse audiences.\" In its second weekend, the film dropped 56.3% to $3.3 million, finishing sixth at the box office.\n\nAronofsky responded to the film's CinemaScore rating by saying that it was meant to be difficult viewing for audiences: \"How if you walk out of this movie are you not going to give it an 'F'? … We wanted to make a punk movie and come at you. And the reason I wanted to come is because I was very sad and I had a lot of anguish and I wanted to express it.\"\n\n\"Mother!\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Aronofsky's direction and the performances, particularly of Lawrence and Pfeiffer. The film received both boos and a standing ovation during its premiere at the Venice Film Festival. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 69%, based on 319 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"There's no denying that \"Mother!\" is the thought-provoking product of a singularly ambitious artistic vision, though it may be too unwieldy for mainstream tastes.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on reviews from 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"F\" on an A+ to F scale, making it one of fewer than twenty films to receive the score, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave a 51% overall positive and a 33% \"definite recommend\".\n\nOwen Gleiberman of \"Variety\", in his positive review of the film, wrote: \"By all means, go to 'Mother!' and enjoy its roller-coaster-of-weird exhibitionism. But be afraid, very afraid, only if you're hoping to see a movie that's as honestly disquieting as it is showy.\" Gleiberman labelled \"Mother!\" as \"a piece of ersatz humanity\". Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, describing the film and Aronofsky's direction as an \"artist's cry from his own corrupt heart\" and \"a work of a visionary\". He also praised the film's allegorical narrative and the performances of Lawrence, Bardem, and Pfeiffer, and said, positively, that the cinematography \"always seems on the verge of exploding\". Writing for the \"Chicago Tribune\", Michael Phillips said \"Darren Aronofsky delivers a damning critique of the artist/muse arrangement, even as he admits to its old-fashioned patriarchal simplicity.\" He also referred to the film and its script as \"grandiose and narcissistic and, in quick strokes, pretty vicious,\" while drawing a similarity to Aronofsky's film, \"Black Swan\".\n\nWriting for \"The Guardian\", Peter Bradshaw gave the film 5 stars, saying, \"Darren Aronofsky’s toweringly outrageous film leaves no gob unsmacked. It is an event-movie detonation, a phantasmagorical horror and black-comic nightmare that jams the narcosis needle right into your abdomen.\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film a B+, writing, \"the filmmaking ranks as some of Aronofsky's most skillful\". Ben Croll of \"IndieWire\" gave the film an A−, noting \"Awash in both religious and contemporary political imagery, Darren Aronofsky's allusive film opens itself to a number of allegorical readings, but it also works as a straight-ahead head rush.\" In an essay for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Martin Scorsese said, \"It was so tactile, so beautifully staged and acted — the subjective camera and the POV reverse angles, always in motion … the sound design, which comes at the viewer from around corners and leads you deeper and deeper into the nightmare … the unfolding of the story, which very gradually becomes more and more upsetting as the film goes forward. The horror, the dark comedy, the biblical elements, the cautionary fable — they're all there, but they're elements in the total experience, which engulfs the characters and the viewers along with them. Only a true, passionate filmmaker could have made this picture, which I'm still experiencing weeks after I saw it.\"\n\nRex Reed gave the film zero stars in \"The New York Observer\", and wrote that despite some good cinematography, \"Nothing about \"Mother!\" makes one lick of sense as Darren Aronofsky's corny vision of madness turns more hilarious than scary. With so much crap around to clog the drain, I hesitate to label it the 'Worst movie of the year' when 'Worst movie of the century' fits it even better.\" Reed further dismissed other critics' positive reviews of the film as \"equally pretentious\" and \"even nuttier than the film itself. ... they all insist \"Mother!\" is a metaphor for something, although they are not quite sure what it is.\" Similarly, \"The New Republic\"’s Josephine Livingstone states that the film has \"no human center to hold it down.\" Anthony Lane in his \"New Yorker\" review wrote, \"My patience was tested beyond repair, I am afraid, by the nimbus of nonsense.\" In his \"Wall Street Journal\" review, John Anderson said, \"it achieves a level of excess that makes the whole enterprise increasingly cartoonish, rather than just awful.\" \"Chicago Sun-Times\" Richard Roeper rated the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing that while he appreciated Lawrence's performance, he questioned whether Aronofsky was mocking certain biblical passages featured in the film or presenting a commentary on an artistic process. Writing for \"The Washington Post\", Anne Hornaday gave the film 2 stars, saying, \"Even Lawrence's magnetic powers can't keep \"Mother!\" from going off the rails, which at first occurs cumulatively, then in a mad rush during the film's outlandish climax.\"\n\nStephen Whitty of the \"Newark Star Ledger\" wrote, \"one part early Roman Polanski, one part pseudo Harold Pinter, and two parts apology-from-a-driven-artist. And none of it adds up. The feeble idea behind \"Mother!\" isn't strong enough to bear the weight of all the overwrought style he hangs on it. Unlike the mansion it's set in, it's a small, hammered-together thing, and it can't bear all this meaning and metaphor.\" Chris Nashawaty of \"Entertainment Weekly\" said \"Darren Aronofsky’s Mother! is Rosemary’s Baby amped up into a fugue state of self-indulgent solipsism. He’s an artist. And he really wants you to know that he’s been thinking a lot about what that means. Unfortunately, his gaze is so deep into his own navel that it’s just exasperating.\" David Edelstein of \"New York\" magazine shrugged off the film and any talk of its craft, writing, \"Most of the dialogue and effects are clunky, repetitive, second rate.\"\n\nThe film's nominations at the 38th Golden Raspberry Awards received backlash from audiences and critics, especially Lawrence's nomination, whose performance was praised by critics.\n\n"}

Her favourite book is a baking-themed book by Irish novelist Marian Keyes.\n\nAt the time of \"The Great British Bake Off\", Hussain was a housewife living in Leeds with her husband, an IT specialist, and three children, while studying for an Open University degree in Childhood and Youth Studies. When she won the final they moved to Milton Keynes, near London, so that she could pursue a culinary career.\n\nIn 2015, Hussain appeared in and won the sixth series of \"The Great British Bake Off\". During the final she baked 16 iced buns in three hours, as well as raspberry-flavoured mille-feuille, to one of Paul Hollywood's recipes, in two hours, and a multi-layered presentation showstopper which took the form of \"My Big Fat British Wedding Cake\", in a time of four hours. During her acceptance speech, she said: \n\nWith more than 15 million viewers, the final was the most-watched show of 2015. Her appearance on the show, and ensuing popularity with audiences, were deemed important steps toward shifting stereotypes about the Muslim community and acceptance about cultural diversity.\n\nHussain established a large following on social media thanks to her stunning show-stoppers and her illuminating facial expressions, her online followers describe themselves as \"Nadiyators\" and also won backing of then Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\nIn 2016, Hussain became judge on \"Junior Bake Off\". Hussain replaced Mary Berry on CBBC's version of the contest in which 40 children aged 9 to 12 compete to create the best cakes and treats.\n\nHussain was presenter of two-part foodie travelogue, \"The Chronicles of Nadiya\", in which she travels to Bangladesh to trace her culinary roots. She visits her paternal grandfather's village in the Sylhet region of north-east Bangladesh. She cooked for the crew of one of the country's famous paddle steamers that ply the waterways, and visited a riverside village where they still practise the ancient art of otter fishing. In the capital Dhaka, she helped \"Thrive\", a charity delivering meals to deprived schoolchildren.\n\nThe first episode debuted immediately after \"The Great British Bake Off\" aired on 24 August 2016 and was watched by 4.5 million viewers, a 20.5% share of all television viewers during the broadcast slot. \"The Chronicles of Nadiya\" was Nominated for 2017 National Television Awards under 'Factual Entertainment' category. For \"The Chronicles of Nadiya\", Hussain was nominated for \"Breakthrough star\" of 2017 in the Royal Television Society Awards.\n\nFrom July 2017 Hussain presented \"Nadiya's British Food Adventure\", an eight-part series on BBC Two. Hussain travelled across the country, visiting food producers, and then returned to her kitchen to cook using ingredients found on her journeys.\n\nA tie-in cookery book, published by Michael Joseph, features new recipes that use British ingredients cooked in a Bangladeshi style, such as Masala eggy bread, Yorkshire pudding with chia seeds and aubergine pakoras with ketchup.\n\nIn autumn 2017 Hussain co-presented \"The Big Family Cooking Showdown\" alongside Zoë Ball. Hussain left the show after one series to focus on her own show – \"Nadiya's Family Favourites\" and mentioned the decision was born out of her desire to get back to cooking.\n\nIn July 2018, Hussain's second TV cookery series aired on BBC Two.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2015, Hussain made a cameo appearance in the BBC One show \"Michael McIntyre's Big Christmas Show\" recorded at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Hussain has appeared as a reporter for \"The One Show\" on BBC One.\n\nHussain is a guest presenter on \"Loose Women\". She announced on the programme that she had been given the honour of baking Queen Elizabeth II's 90th birthday cake, an orange drizzle cake with orange curd and orange butter cream. Hussain said: \"When I told the kids (I was making a cake for the Queen), the boys were great at keeping it a secret. I told my daughter and she said, 'Oh Mary Berry? You’ve made lots of cakes for Mary Berry'.\"\n\nIn August 2016, Hussain was a guest on BBC Radio 4's \"Desert Island Discs\", and was interviewed by Kirsty Young. She opened up about her struggles as a young mother, the social isolation suffered by some Muslim women and how her confidence grew during Bake-Off. She described the racial abuse she still receives on the street and, determined to be a good role model to her children, how she responds with the \"dignity of silence\".\n\nIn December 2016, Hussain presented a two-hour cookery show at her home on BBC Radio 2 alongside Olly Smith as part of BBC radio Christmas line-up. The show is her first new programme after signing a deal to make the BBC her 'home' – scotching speculation she would join Channel 4's version of Bake Off.\n\nOn 9 December Hussain was a guest on BBC One's \"The Graham Norton Show\".\n\nHussain is Contributing Editor to UK's biggest food media brand, BBC's Good Food . Hussain also writes a monthly column for \"The Times Magazine\", a part of the Saturday supplement of \"The Times\", and was previously columnist for \"Essentials\" magazine.\n\nHer recipes have also appeared in BBC's \"Good Food\" magazine, The Sun on Sunday's \"Fabulous magazine\", The Guardian and The Telegraph.\n\nHussain was signed by UK publisher Michael Joseph, part of Penguin Random House, for her debut book \"Nadiya's Kitchen\", which is a collection of the recipes which she cooks for friends and family. In 2017, Michael Joseph is published a tie-in cookery book for Hussain's primetime eight-part BBC2 cookery series of the same name, \"Nadiya's British Food Adventure\".\n\nHussain has written a children's book of stories and recipes, \"Bake Me A Story\", published by Hodder Children's Books, which blends updated versions of fairytales (poor \"Sleepless Beauty\" just needs a nice cup of cardamom-infused hot chocolate to break her curse; resourceful Jack wins the giant over with yummy bean patties) with colourful illustrations and child-friendly recipes. In 2017, \"Bake Me A Story\" was shortlisted for \"Children's Book of the Year\" prize at the British Book Awards. Following the success, a second cookbook and storybook compilation, \"Nadiya's Bake Me a Festive Story\" will be published in October 2017.\n\nThe 2016 chart of the \"Top 100 Food & Drink books\" by book sales, compiled by industry analysts Nielsen, placed Hussain's books \"Nadiya's Kitchen\" and \"Bake Me A Story\", in third and fourth place respectively.\n\nNadiya's released her first novel, \"The Secret Lives of the Amir Sisters\", in January 2017 with help from author Ayisha Malik and was billed as a British Muslim take on Little Women. A review published in The Guardian by Jenny Colgan sparked a fierce backlash on social media after Colgan questioned if Hussain \"really need to put her name to a novel, too, when there’s only so much shelf space to go around?” and accused Hussain of being “greedy”.\n\nIn 2018, Hussain launched her own Homeware range in collaboration with \"BlissHome\". The collection features designs across a full tableware range, as well as spice racks, candles, aprons, oven gloves and tea towels.\n\nHussain was commissioned by Buckingham Palace to bake Elizabeth II's cake as part of her 90th birthday celebrations. Hussain chose to bake an orange drizzle cake with orange curd and orange buttercream.\n\nHussain was commissioned by London Dungeon to mark the 350th anniversary of the Great Fire of London, and created a fire-inspired loaf. In June 2016, Hussain collaborated with Champneys Spa Hotel to create a special afternoon tea dessert. She was also commissioned by Disney to make an Alice inspired cake for 'Alice Through the Looking Glass' themed tea party in London.\n\nAt the age of 19, Hussain married Abdal Hussain, whom she had only met once before, in an arranged marriage; they married in a traditional ceremony in Bangladesh. They have two sons and a daughter. Hussain's birthday is on Christmas Day and her sister Sadiya's birthday is on Christmas Eve.\n\nHussain is ambassador for Starlight Children's Foundation, which supports lives of seriously ill children and is also WaterAid ambassador. Hussain has shown her support for Armistice Day by wearing a 'poppy headscarf', designed to commemorate the number of Muslim soldiers who fought in World War One as well as promote the wearing of the poppy amongst British Muslims. In 2018, Hussain became a brand ambassador for Swarovski on a campaign focusing on female empowerment.\n\nHussain contributed a baking recipe for the YoungMinds mental health charity's HelloYellow day, for World Mental Health Day on 10 October 2018. \n\n\n\n"}

It remained unpublished, however, until after the third edition of \"Frankenstein\" appeared in 1831. Percy Bysshe Shelley's cousin Thomas Medwin submitted it to the British literary magazine \"The Athenaeum\" for the Saturday, November 10, 1832 issue on page 730. It was part of the series \"The Shelley Papers\" which appeared in \"The Athenaeum\" starting in September, 1832. \n\nIn his biography \"Life of Shelley\", Medwin had written that he sought to have the review published to demonstrate that, contrary to claims, Shelley did not write the novel and did not have any role in its creation: \"I have heard it asserted that the idea [of \"Frankenstein\"] was [Percy Bysshe] Shelley's, and that he assisted much in the development of the plot.\" Notwithstanding Medwin's own claims, the drafts and proofs of the novel showed that this statement was accurate. Shelley had come up with the idea for the novel, as Mary herself acknowledged in the 1831 Introduction, and he had, at the very least, made substantial contributions to the writing of the novel. Mary had not, however, included the review in her compilations and publications of Shelley's prose works. John Lauritsen in \"The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein\" argued that Mary suppressed the review because she feared it would expose Shelley as the true author of the novel.\n\nThe review was republished in Thomas Medwin's \"Memoir of Percy Bysshe Shelley; and Original Poems and Papers by Percy Bysshe Shelley: Now First Collected\" in 1833. The review also appeared in \"The Prose Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley\" edited by E. B. Murray in 1993.\n\nThe review was republished in \"The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein\" by John Lauritsin in 2007 and \"The Original Frankenstein\" edited by Charles E. Robinson in 2008.\n\nShelley wrote that the dialogues between the Being and De Lacey were the most powerful and moving in the novel. He wrote that the central moral of the novel is intolerance, describing innocent victims of prejudice in society, \"who are best qualified to be its benefactors and its ornaments.\" Shelley argued that the Being was a product of a xenophobic society: \"Treat a person ill, and he will become wicked.\"\n\nShelley referred to the monster as the \"Being\" five times in his review. He also referred to the anonymous author using a masculine pronoun, \"he\".\n\nThe British Library analysis noted the direct connection to Shelley's poem \"Mont Blanc\" which was published in 1817 in \"History of a Six Weeks' Tour\". \"Frankenstein\" develops the theme of \"necessity\" which Shelley wrote about in that poem. It is a philosophical idea of the novel.\n\nThe review related \"Frankenstein\" to Percy Bysshe Shelley's own works: \n\n\"The environment is an aspect Shelley also emphasises in his preface to the 1818 edition. He examines the way the monster turns against the world as a direct result of his treatment. For Shelley this is an example of the philosophical idea he defined as necessity, 'an immense and uninterrupted chain of causes and effects', which is explored in 'Mont Blanc' and is 'the direct moral' of \"Frankenstein\". He points out that the monster’s mind is formed by impressions, and thus a conflict is created between Frankenstein monster’s good intentions (moments at which he is 'affectionate and full of moral sensibility') and the reactions of those around him to his 'tremendous' (frightening) appearance.\"\n\nShelley concluded that the novel was \"one of the most original and complete productions of the age.\"\n\n"}

In the early 19th century, it was split and partially dispersed, and some of the predella panels were acquired by the Pinacoteca Vaticana. In Perugia were executed copies of these panels, enclosed into a neo-Gothic frame. The polyptych also included some small depictions of saints, on the side piers, and two tondoes with the \"Annunciation Angel\" and the \"Annunciation\", in the cusps.\n\nThe work includes a large central panel, depicting the \"Madonna Enthroned with Child and Angels\", which was fully painted by Fra Angelico.

Like Erich Auerbach, Wellek was an eminent product of the Central European philological tradition and was known as a vastly erudite and \"fair-minded critic of critics.\"\n\nRené Wellek was born and raised in Vienna, speaking Czech and German. He studied literature at the Charles University in Prague, and was active among the Prague School linguists there, before moving to teach at School of Slavonic and East European Studies (now part of University College London) in 1935. His younger brother Albert Wellek (1904-1972) was one of the founders of musical psychology and lived in Germany. Before 1939, Wellek published some 60 items, all written in Czech.\n\nFrom 1939, the beginning of World War II in Europe, Wellek lived in America. He taught first at the University of Iowa for seven years until 1946, and then, beginning in that year, at Yale University, where he established and chaired a department of comparative literature. In the United States, he was \"widely regarded as a founder of the study of comparative literature.\" With Austin Warren, Wellek published a landmark volume entitled \"Theory of Literature\", one of the first works to systematize literary theory.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, Wellek defended the New Critics against the condemnation of their work in the name of a structuralist-influenced literary theory, and is thus sometimes classed as a conservative critic. Wellek advocated a synthesized approach to literary criticism, one that included 1) literary theory, 2) a careful study of previous works of criticism, and 3) a thorough understanding of the surrounding history involved in an author's creation of a work, including the author's personal history and milieu. Any approach elevating one of these aspects above the other would be in error. Wellek said the best literary critic must \"do what every scientist and scholar does: to isolate his object, in our case, the literary work of art, to contemplate it intently, to analyze, to interpret, and finally to evaluate it by criteria derived from, verified by, buttressed by, as wide a knowledge, as close an observation, as keen a sensibility, as honest a judgment as we can command.\" According to Wellek, bringing all of literary theory, criticism, and history into consideration allows a critic to achieve \"victory over impermanence, relativity, and history.\"\n\nThe crowning work of Wellek's career was an eight-volume \"magnum opus\" entitled \"A History of Modern Criticism: 1750-1950\", the last two volumes of which he dictated from his bed in a nursing home at age 90.\n\n\n\n"}

It was an Operation Bootstrap initiatives undertaken following the 1965 Watts Riots. Company proceeds supported businesses in the Watts area. Shindana (a Swahili word roughly meaning \"to compete\") Toys was community-owned and founded by Louis S. Smith, II and Robert Hall. The latter was the company's first CEO and President; though he was succeeded in both posts by Smith. The Chase Manhattan Bank, the Mattel Toy Company, Sears Roebuck & Co., and Equitable Life Assurance helped finance portions of the Shindana Toys operations.\n\nShindana Toys was historically significant for being one of the first toy companies (if not the first) to market ethnically-correct black dolls. A goal of the company was to raise Black consciousness and improve self-image. In a 1970s Los Angeles Associated Press article, company president, Louis Smith said, \"We believe that only by learning to love oneself can one learn to love others...Shindana believes that by marketing black dolls and games that both black and white children can learn to relate to at an early age, the company can foster the spirit of what Shindana is all about, love.\"\n\nFrom a shop on Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, California, Doris Conner—an African American, entrepreneurial businesswoman—along with her daughters, Lynne and Tuesday Conner, created, designed, and manufactured many of the clothes worn by Shindana Dolls. They also manufactured the Flip Wilson doll.\nWhile the first doll created by Shindana Toys was named \"Baby Nancy,\" many later Shindana Toys dolls featured ethnically correct names, including names that were Swahili in origin. Operation Bootstrap contracted with Mattel Toymakers to create a talking voice unit, just like the one invented for Chatty Cathy in 1960, for their doll Tamu in 1971. The popular Talking Tamu (Swahili for \"sweet\") doll was designed to say the following 11 phrases when you pulled her \"talking ring\":\n\n\nTamu was featured in the Sears Roebuck, JC Penney, and Montgomery Wards Christmas catalogs, and available in most stores where ever toys were sold.\n\nShindana dolls were created with the likenesses of positive Black celebrities, including Flip Wilson, Jimmie Walker (these were pull string talking dolls like Tamu), Julius Erving (a.k.a. Dr. J.), O.J. Simpson, Marla Gibbs, Redd Foxx, Diana Ross, and Michael Jackson. Children could make some of these dolls \"talk\" by pulling and releasing a string.\n\nThis line featured \"soft cloth-body rag dolls with natural-style hair\" and clothing imprinted with uplifting phrases like \"Peace,\" \"Right On,\" \"I'm Proud, Say It Loud\", and \"Learn, baby, learn.\" The last phrase was a transformation of the \"Burn, baby, burn\" chants heard during the Watts Riots. These dolls were given name like \"Sis,\" \"Natra,\" \"Wilky,\" and \"Coochy.\" The 1971 Sears Wish Book priced these dolls between $1.89 and $2.19.\n\nThis collection featured Black, Caucasian, Asian, and Hispanic boys and girls—most about 12 inches tall and with attention given to ethnic details.\n\n\"Each of Wanda's boxes included a little pamphlet explaining the doll's particular profession. Photos of real Black women in these professions and their comments about the nature of their jobs gave suggestions on what the child might do to learn more about the job.\" Some of Wanda's careers included nurse, skydiver/race car driver, tennis player, and singer.\n\nThanks in part to its acquisition of a company that produced board games, Shindana also started distributing games. These games included titles like \"Jackson 5ive Action Game,\" \"The Black Experience,\" \"The Afro-American History Mystery Game,\" \"Captain Soul,\" and \"The Learning Tree.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "162595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162595", "title": "Tactical frivolity", "text": "Tactical frivolity\n\nTactical frivolity is a form of public protest involving humour; often including peaceful non-compliance with authorities, carnival and whimsical antics. Humour has played a role in political protests at least as far back as the Classical period in ancient Greece. Yet it is only since the 1990s that the term \"tactical frivolity\" gained common currency for describing the use of humour in opposing perceived political injustice. Generally the term is used to denote a whimsical, nonconfrontational approach rather than aggressive mocking or cutting jokes.\n\nThe study of humour by social historians did not become popular until the early 1980s and the literature on this subject studying periods before the 20th century is relatively sparse. An exception is the frequently cited Rabelais and His World by Mikhail Bakhtin, a Russian scholar considered by some to be the most important thinker of the 20th century. The work discusses the life and times of the writer and satirist François Rabelais with emphases on what the author considers to be the powerful role of humour in medieval and early times. Carnivals, Satire and the French folk custom of Charivari were discussed as mediums that allowed the lower classes to use humour to highlight unjust behaviour by the upper classes. These humorous protests were generally tolerated by the ruling authorities. Examples of the use of humour for political protest even from Classical times, such as the play Lysistrata by ancient Greek dramatist Aristophanes, have been described as \"Rabeleisan protest\".\nStudies of hunter gather tribes thought to have systems of social organisation that have changed little since prehistoric times, have found that ridicule or anger is used by many tribes to oppose any individual who tries to assume authority in a way that violates the tribe's egalitarian norms. Tribes observed to show this behaviour include the !Kung, Mbuti, Naskapi and Hazda.\nAn example of a political protest making extensive use of humour in early modern times was the 17th century British movement, the Levellers.\nThere is much more extensive literature covering the use of humour by the protest movements which emerged in the 20th century.\n\nIn the United States, Abbie Hoffman is a well-known user of frivolous tactics; active in the 1960s and 70s, his actions included dropping money onto the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange, running a pig as a candidate for president, and the \"levitation\" of the Pentagon. One of the earliest protest groups whose use of humour has been specifically described as \"tactical frivolity\" is Orange Alternative, a movement that emerged in Poland during the early 1980s as a part of the broader Solidarity campaign. They made extensive use of visual jokes and theatrical stunts to protest against oppression by the authorities, a common theme was to dress up as elves (sometimes translated dwarves or gnomes). Orange Alternative have been described as the most \"influential of the solidarity factions\", central to enabling the overall movement to prevail; due in part to the success their comedic \"happenings\" enjoyed in attracting the attention of the world's media. \nA protest movement described as partly responsible for popularising the contemporary use of \"Tactical Frivolity\" is Reclaim the Streets (\"RTS\"). They formed in 1991 in Great Britain, inspired in part by the anti-road protests of the previous decades and in part by the Situationists. As the 1990s advanced, RTS inspired splinter groups in other countries across the world, and they were heavily involved in organising the international Carnival against Capitalism—an anti-capitalism event held in many cities simultaneously on June 18, 1999. \"Carnival against Capitalism\", frequently known as \"J18\", is sometimes credited as being the first of the major international anti-capitalist protests. \"RTS\" have reported that many of their organisers were inspired by independently reading the work of Bakhtin.\n\nLarge scale International anti-capitalist protests are widely seen as dawning between 1998 and 2000 with events such as the protests at the Birmingham 1998 G8, \"J18\", the Seattle 1999 WTO protests and the Prague 2000 IMF protests.\n\nThe 1999 Seattle demonstrations saw extensive violent clashes with the police. For the 2000 protest in Prague, demonstrators divided themselves into three broad groupings based in part on the way they wished to engage with the authorities. There was a \"Yellow march\" for traditional non violent protest, a \"Blue march\" for those who were up for physically taking on the police, and a \"Silver and Pink\" group which is described as employing \"tactical frivolity\" and also in being the most successful in terms of penetrating the security cordon around the IMF meeting. Attending Prague was also a small group specifically calling itself \"Tactical Frivolity\", which consisted of a Samba band plus thirteen women from Yorkshire dressed as pink fairies.\n\nTen months later, a group of protesters dressed in carnival outfits and again calling themselves the Pink and Silver bloc, or \"Pink Fairies\", used the term \"tactical frivolity\" to describe their own methods when protesting at the 27th G8 summit in Genoa. These included waving \"magic fairy wands\" at the police and training \"radical cheerleaders,\" as well as the deployment of a \"revolutionary spaghetti catapult\" designed to \"splatter the leaders with pasta\". The device failed to hit any leaders with spaghetti, but according to journalist Johann Hari the \"Pink Fairies\" did succeed in causing mass laughter among the crowds.\n\nIn the early 21st century, tactical frivolity was often used at much smaller events than global summits, for example by the group Billionaires for Bush who would stage humorous events at US Republican conventions. According to David Graeber, this upswell in the use of humorous protest tactics can be traced in part to the Yippies of the 1960s and the Zapatista which began operations in the 1990s.\n\nAt the 2005 G8 summit in Scotland, tactical frivolity was again used by protesters such as the Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army a group whose theatrical and carnival like performances succeeded in attracting considerable media attention and were funded by Arts Council England.\nThe large scale use of tactical frivolity at the 2001 and 2005 G8 protests failed to deliver any tangible change in policy. But the method continued to be used, for example at protests held concerning air travel at Heathrow, England, during 2007.\n\nTactical frivolity was used at the 2011 London anti-cuts protest. Some of the \"tactical frivolity protestors\" integrated fully into the main march—others trailed in the wake of black bloc anarchists, while remaining non violent themselves.\nAdbusters, the magazine credited for starting the global Occupy movement, called for Occupiers to use tactical frivolity, though the method has only been used sporadically. Author and academic Luke Bretherton has suggested that tactical frivolity allows protestors to represent the otherwise inexpressible sacred power of imagination, which is achieved partly through the \"use of huge puppets, dance and street theatre\".\n\n\n"}

He is known for compassionate egg tempera pictures of children in mysterious circumstances.\n\nTim Lowly was born Tim Grubbs. From the age of three he lived in South Korea, where his parents were Presbyterian missionaries. He learned piano and guitar and still plays and composes folk-rock music. Lowly attended Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, majoring in art. He married Sherrie Rubingh in 1981, and rather than subordinate anyone's last name, they changed their surname to Lowly.\n\nAfter a visit to Korea and Europe, Lowly took up the exacting renaissance art of egg tempera painting, in which egg yolk is mixed with pigment to make paint.\n\nThe Lowlys had a daughter, Temma, in 1985, who was brain-damaged and is frequently the subject of Mr. Lowly's paintings. Lowly says, \"Part of my fairly political agenda is to say that disabled children are a part of life. These are not freaks. What I'm saying is that we should advocate for eyes of compassion that see human beings as human beings, rather than separating them into the beautiful, the ugly, the normal, the freak.\"\n\nLowly has been awarded an Individual Artist Grant from the Michigan Council for the Arts in 1987 and Fellowships in Visual Art from the Illinois Arts Council in 1995 and 2005. He teaches at North Park University in Chicago.\n\n\n"}
