{"id": "1518375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1518375", "title": "Alexandru Macedonski", "text": "Alexandru Macedonski\n\nAlexandru Macedonski (; also rendered as Al. A. Macedonski, Macedonschi or Macedonsky; March 14, 1854 – November 24, 1920) was a Romanian poet, novelist, dramatist and literary critic, known especially for having promoted French Symbolism in his native country, and for leading the Romanian Symbolist movement during its early decades. A forerunner of local modernist literature, he is the first local author to have used free verse, and claimed by some to have been the first in modern European literature. Within the framework of Romanian literature, Macedonski is seen by critics as second only to national poet Mihai Eminescu; as leader of a cosmopolitan and aestheticist trend formed around his \"Literatorul\" journal, he was diametrically opposed to the inward-looking traditionalism of Eminescu and his school.\n\nDebuting as a Neoromantic in the Wallachian tradition, Macedonski went through the Realist-Naturalist stage deemed \"social poetry\", while progressively adapting his style to Symbolism and Parnassianism, and repeatedly but unsuccessfully attempting to impose himself in the Francophone world. Despite having theorized \"instrumentalism\", which reacted against the traditional guidelines of poetry, he maintained a lifelong connection with Neoclassicism and its ideal of purity. Macedonski's quest for excellence found its foremost expression in his recurring motif of life as a pilgrimage to Mecca, notably used in his critically acclaimed \"Nights\" cycle. The stylistic stages of his career are reflected in the collections \"Prima verba\", \"Poezii\", and \"Excelsior\", as well as in the fantasy novel \"Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu\". In old age, he became the author of rondels, noted for their detached and serene vision of life, in contrast with his earlier combativeness.\n\nIn parallel to his literary career, Macedonski was a civil servant, notably serving as prefect in the Budjak and Northern Dobruja during the late 1870s. As journalist and militant, his allegiance fluctuated between the liberal current and conservatism, becoming involved in polemics and controversies of the day. Of the long series of publications he founded, \"Literatorul\" was the most influential, notably hosting his early conflicts with the \"Junimea\" literary society. These targeted Vasile Alecsandri and especially Eminescu, their context and tone becoming the cause of a major rift between Macedonski and his public. This situation repeated itself in later years, when Macedonski and his \"Forța Morală\" magazine began campaigning against the \"Junimist\" dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale, whom they falsely accused of plagiarism. During World War I, the poet aggravated his critics by supporting the Central Powers against Romania's alliance with the Entente side. His biography was also marked by an enduring interest in esotericism, numerous attempts to become recognized as an inventor, and an enthusiasm for cycling.\n\nThe scion of a political and aristocratic family, the poet was the son of General Alexandru Macedonski, who served as Defense Minister, and the grandson of 1821 rebel Dimitrie Macedonski. Both his son Alexis and grandson Soare were known painters.\n\nThe poet's paternal family had arrived in Wallachia during the early 19th century. Of South Slav (Serb or Bulgarian) or Aromanian origin, they claimed to have descended from Serb insurgents in Ottoman-ruled Macedonia. Alexandru's grandfather Dimitrie and Dimitrie's brother Pavel participated in the 1821 uprising against the Phanariote administration, and in alliance with the Filiki Eteria; Dimitrie made the object of controversy when, during the final stage of the revolt, he sided with the Eteria in its confrontation with Wallachian leader Tudor Vladimirescu, taking an active part in the latter's killing. Both Macedonski brothers had careers in the Wallachian military forces, at a time when the country was governed by Imperial Russian envoys, when the \"Regulamentul Organic\" regime recognized the family as belonging to Wallachia's nobility. Dimitrie married Zoe, the daughter an ethnic Russian or Polish officer; their son, the Russian-educated Alexandru, climbed in the military and political hierarchy, joining the unified Land Forces after his political ally, Alexander John Cuza, was elected \"Domnitor\" and the two Danubian Principalities became united Romania. Both the officer's uncle Pavel and brother Mihail were amateur poets.\n\nMacedonski's mother, Maria Fisența (also \"Vicenț\" or \"Vicența\"), was from an aristocratic environment, being the scion of Oltenian boyars. Through her father, she may have descended from Russian immigrants who had been absorbed into Oltenia's nobility. Maria had been adopted by the boyar Dumitrache Pârâianu, and the couple had inherited the Adâncata and Pometești estates in Goiești, on the Amaradia Valley.\n\nBoth the poet and his father were dissatisfied with accounts of their lineage, contradicting them with an account that researchers have come to consider spurious. Although adherents of the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Macedonskis traced their origin to Rogala-bearing Lithuanian nobility from the defunct Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. While the writer perpetuated his father's claim, it is possible that he also took pride in investigating his Balkan roots: according to literary historian Tudor Vianu, who, as a youth, was a member of his circle, this tendency is attested by two of Macedonski's poems from the 1880s, where the South Slavs appear as icons of freedom. Vianu's contemporary, literary historian George Călinescu, postulated that, although the family had been absorbed into the ethnic and cultural majority, the poet's origin served to enrich local culture by linking it to a \"Thracian\" tradition and the spirit of \"adventurers\".\n\nThe family moved often, following General Macedonski's postings. Born in Bucharest, Macedonski-son was the third of four siblings, the oldest of whom was a daughter, Caterina. Before the age of six, he was a sickly and nervous child, who is reported to have had regular tantrums. In 1862, his father sent him to school in Oltenia, and he spent most time in the Amaradia region. The nostalgia he felt for the landscape later made him consider writing an \"Amărăzene\" (\"Amaradians\") cycle, of which only one poem was ever completed. He was attending the Carol I High School in Craiova and, according to his official record, graduated in 1867.\n\nMacedonski's father had by then become known as an authoritarian commander, and, during his time in Târgu Ocna, faced a mutiny which only his wife could stop by pleading with the soldiers (an episode which made an impression on the future poet). A stern parent, he took an active part in educating his children. Having briefly served as Defense Minister, the general was mysteriously dismissed by Cuza in 1863, and his pension became the topic of a political scandal. It ended only under the rule of Carol I, Cuza's Hohenzollern successor, when Parliament voted against increasing the sum to the level demanded by its recipient. Having preserved a negative impression of the 1866 plebiscite, during which Cuza's dethronement had been confirmed, Macedonski remained a committed opponent of the new ruler. As a youth and adult, he sought to revive his father's cause, and included allusions to the perceived injustice in at least one poem. After spending the last months of his life protesting against the authorities, Macedonski-father fell ill and died in September 1869, leaving his family to speculate that he had been murdered by political rivals.\n\nMacedonski left Romania in 1870, traveling through Austria-Hungary and spending time in Vienna, before visiting Switzerland and possibly other countries; according to one account, it was here that he may have first met (and disliked) his rival poet Mihai Eminescu, at a time a Viennese student. Macedonski's visit was meant to be preparation for entering the University of Bucharest, but he spent much of his time in the bohemian environment, seeking entertainment and engaging in romantic escapades. He was however opposed to the lifestyle choices of people his age, claiming that they were engaged in \"orgy after orgy\". At around that date, the young author had begun to perfect a style heavily influenced by Romanticism, and in particular by his Wallachian predecessors Dimitrie Bolintineanu and Ion Heliade Rădulescu. He was for a while in Styria, at Bad Gleichenberg, a stay which, George Călinescu believes, may have been the result of a medical recommendation to help him counter excessive nervousness. The landscape there inspired him to write an ode. Also in 1870, he published his first lyrics in George Bariț's Transylvanian-based journal \"Telegraful Român\".\n\nThe following year, he left for Italy, where he visited Pisa, Florence, Venice, and possibly other cities. His records of the journey indicate that he was faced with financial difficulties and plagued by disease. Macedonski also claimed to have attended college lectures in these cities, and to have spent significant time studying at Pisa University, but this remains uncertain. He eventually returned to Bucharest, where he entered the Faculty of Letters (which he never attended regularly). According to Călinescu, Macedonski \"did not feel the need\" to attend classes, because \"such a young man will expect society to render upon him its homages.\" He was again in Italy during spring 1872, soon after publishing his debut volume \"Prima verba\" (Latin for \"First Word\"). Having also written an anti-Carol piece, published in \"Telegraful Român\" during 1873, Macedonski reportedly feared political reprisals, and decided to make another visit to Styria and Italy while his case was being assessed. It was in Italy that he met French musicologist Jules Combarieu, with whom he corresponded sporadically over the following decades.\n\nDuring that period, Macedonski became interested in the political scene and political journalism, first as a sympathizer of the liberal-radical current—which, in 1875, organized itself around the National Liberal Party. In 1874, back in Craiova, Macedonski founded a short-lived literary society known as \"Junimea\", a title which purposefully or unwittingly copied that of the influential conservative association with whom he would later quarrel. It was then that he met journalist and pedagogue Ștefan Velescu, a meeting witnessed by Velescu's pupil, the future liberal journalist Constantin Bacalbașa, who recorded it in his memoirs. \"Oltul\" magazine, which he had helped establish and which displayed a liberal agenda, continued to be published until July 1875, and featured Macedonski's translations from Pierre-Jean de Béranger, Hector de Charlieu and Alphonse de Lamartine, as well as his debut in travel writing and short story. At age 22, he worked on his first play, a comedy titled \"Gemenii\" (\"The Twins\"). In 1874 that he came to the attention of young journalist future dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale, who satirized him in articles for the magazine \"Ghimpele\", ridiculing his claim to Lithuanian descent, and eventually turning him into the character \"Aamsky\", whose fictional career ends with his death from exhaustion caused by contributing to \"for the country's political development\". This was the first episode in a consuming polemic between the two figures. Reflecting back on this period in 1892, Macedonski described Caragiale as a \"noisy young man\" of \"sophistic reasoning\", whose target audience was to be found in \"beer gardens\".\n\nIn March 1875, Macedonski was arrested on charges of defamation or sedition. For almost a year before, he and \"Oltul\" had taken an active part in the campaign against Conservative Party and its leader, Premier Lascăr Catargiu. In this context, he had demanded that the common man \"rise up with weapons in their hands and break both the government agents and the government\", following up with similar messages aimed at the \"Domnitor\". He was taken to Bucharest's Văcărești prison and confined there for almost three months. Supported by the liberal press and defended by the most prestigious pro-liberal attorneys (Nicolae Fleva among them), Macedonski faced a jury trial on June 7, being eventually cleared of the charges. Reportedly, the Bucharest populace organized a spontaneous celebration of the verdict.\n\nIn 1875, after the National Liberal Ion Emanuel Florescu was assigned the post of Premier by Carol, Macedonski embarked on an administrative career. The poet was upset by not being included on the National Liberal list for the 1875 suffrage. This disenchantment led him into a brief conflict with the young liberal figure Bonifaciu Florescu, only to join him soon afterward in editing \"Stindardul\" journal, alongside Pantazi Ghica and George Fălcoianu. The publication followed the line of Nicolae Moret Blaremberg, made notorious for his radical and republican agenda. Ghica and Macedonski remained close friends until Ghica's 1882 death.\n\nThe new cabinet eventually appointed him Prefect of Bolgrad region, in the Budjak (at the time part of Romania). In parallel, he published his first translation, a version of \"Parisina\", an 1816 epic poem by Lord Byron, and completed the original works \"Ithalo\" and \"Calul arabului\" (\"The Arab's Horse\"). He also spoke at the Romanian Atheneum, presenting his views on the state of Romanian literature (1878). His time in office ended upon the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War. At the time, Russian volunteers were amassed on the Budjak border, requesting from the Romanian authorities the right of free passage into the Principality of Serbia. The National Liberal Premier Ion Brătianu, who was negotiating an anti-Ottoman alliance, sent Macedonski signals to let them pass, but the prefect, obeying the official recommendation of Internal Affairs Minister George D. Vernescu, decided against it, and was consequently stripped of his office.\n\nStill determined to pursue a career in the press, Macedonski founded a string of unsuccessful magazines with patriotic content and titles such as \"Vestea\" (\"The Announcement\"), \"Dunărea\" (\"The Danube\"), \"Fulgerul\" (\"The Lightning\") and, after 1880, \"Tarara\" (an onomatopoeia equivalent to \"Toodoodoo\"). Their history is connected with that of the Russo-Turkish War, at the end of which Romanian participation on the Russian side resulted in her independence. Macedonski remained committed to the anti-Ottoman cause, and, some thirty years later, stated: \"We want no Turkey in Europe!\"\n\nBy 1879, the poet, who continued to voice criticism of Carol, had several times switched sides between the National Liberals and the opposition Conservatives. That year, while the Budjak was ceded to Russia and Northern Dobruja was integrated into Romania, the Brătianu cabinet appointed him administrator of the Sulina \"plasă\" and the Danube Delta. He had previously refused to be made comptroller in Putna County, believing such an appointment to be beneath his capacity, and had lost a National Liberal appointment in Silistra when Southern Dobruja was granted to the Principality of Bulgaria. During this short interval in office, he traveled to the Snake Island in the Black Sea—his appreciation for the place later motivated him to write the fantasy novel \"Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu\" and the poem \"Lewki\".\n\nWith the 1880s came a turning point in Alexandru Macedonski's career. Vianu notes that changes took place in the poet's relationship with his public: \"Society recognizes in him the nonconformist. [...] The man becomes singular; people start talking about his oddities.\" Macedonski's presumed frustration at being perceived in this way, Vianu notes, may have led him closer to the idea of \"poète maudit\", theorized earlier by Paul Verlaine. In this context, he had set his sight on promoting \"social poetry\", the merger between lyricism and political militantism. Meanwhile, according to Călinescu, his attacks on the liberals and the \"daft insults he aimed at [Romania's] throne\" had effectively ruined his own chance of political advancement.\n\nIn January 1880, he launched his most influential and long-lived publication, \"Literatorul\", which was also the focal point of his eclectic cultural circle, and, in later years, of the local Symbolist school. In its first version, the magazine was co-edited by Macedonski, Bonifaciu Florescu and poet Th. M. Stoenescu. Florescu parted with the group soon after, due to a disagreement with Macedonski, and was later attacked by the latter for allegedly accumulating academic posts. \"Literatorul\" aimed to irritate \"Junimist\" sensibilities from its first issue, when it stated its dislike for \"political prejudice in literature.\" This was most likely an allusion to the views of \"Junimist\" figure Titu Maiorescu, being later accompanied by explicit attacks on him and his followers. An early success for the new journal was the warm reception it received from Vasile Alecsandri, a Romantic poet and occasional \"Junimist\" whom Macedonski idolized at the time, and the collaboration of popular memoirist Gheorghe Sion. Another such figure was the intellectual V. A. Urechia, whom Macedonski made president of the \"Literatorul\" Society. In 1881, Education Minister Urechia granted Macedonski the \"Bene-Merenti\" medal 1st class, although, Călinescu stresses, the poet had only totaled 18 months of public service. At around that time, Macedonski had allegedly begun courting actress Aristizza Romanescu, who rejected his advances, leaving him unenthusiastic about love matters and unwilling to seek female company.\nIn parallel, Macedonski used the magazine to publicize his disagreement with the main \"Junimist\" voice, \"Convorbiri Literare\". Among the group of contributors, several had already been victims of Maiorescu's irony: Sion, Urechia, Pantazi Ghica and Petru Grădișteanu. While welcoming the debut of its contributor, Parnassian-Neoclassicist novelist and poet Duiliu Zamfirescu, Macedonski repeatedly attacked its main exponent, the conservative poet Eminescu, claiming not to understand his poetry. However, \"Literatorul\" was also open to contributions from some \"Convorbiri Literare\" affiliates (Zamfirescu, Matilda Cugler-Poni and Veronica Micle).\n\nIn November 1880, Macedonski's plays \"Iadeș!\" (\"Wishbone!\", a comedy first printed in 1882) and \"Unchiașul Sărăcie\" (\"Old Man Poverty\") premiered at the National Theater Bucharest. A sign of government approval, this was followed by Macedonski's appointment to a minor administrative office, as Historical Monuments Inspector. Nevertheless, both plays failed to impose themselves on public perception, and were withdrawn from the program by 1888. Călinescu asserts that, although Macedonski later claimed to have always been facing poverty, his job in the administration, coupled with other sources of revenue, ensured him a comfortable existence.\n\nIn 1881, Macedonski published a new collection of poetry. Titled \"Poezii\", it carries the year \"1882\" on its original cover. Again moving away from liberalism, Macedonski sought to make himself accepted by \"Junimea\" and Maiorescu. He consequently attended the \"Junimea\" sessions, and gave a public reading of \"Noaptea de noiembrie\" (\"November Night\"), the first publicized piece in his lifelong \"Nights\" cycle. It reportedly earned him the praise of historian and poet Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, who, although an anti-\"Junimist\", happened to be in the audience. Despite rumors according to which he had applauded Macedonski, Maiorescu himself was not impressed, and left an unenthusiastic account of the event in his private diary.\n\nMacedonski's open conflict with \"Junimea\" began in 1882, when he engaged in a publicized polemic with Alecsandri. It was ignited when, through Macedonski's articles, \"Literatorul\" criticized Alecsandri for accepting Romanian Academy prizes despite being its member, and later involved Sion (whose replies on behalf of the Academy were derided by Macedonski). Macedonski also took distance from Alecsandri's style, publishing a \"critical analysis\" of his poetry in one issue of \"Literatorul\". In turn, Alecsandri humiliated his young rival by portraying him as Zoilus, the prototype of slanderers, and himself as the model poet Horace in the 1883 play \"Fântâna Blanduziei\". The two were eventually reconciled, and Macedonski again spoke of Alecsandri as his ideological and stylistic predecessor.\n\nIn April 1882, Eminescu had also replied to Macedonski in \"Timpul\" journal, referring to an unnamed poet who \"barely finishes high-school, comes over to Bucharest selling nick-nacks and makeup [and goes into] literary dealership\". Reproaching Macedonski's attacks on Alecsandri, Eminescu makes a nationalist comment about the young poet bearing \"the bastard instincts of those foreigners who were Romanianized only yesterday\", and attributes him \"the physiognomy of a hairdresser\". Through the articles of Petru Th. Missir, \"Convorbiri Literare\" gave \"Poezii\" a negative review, deemed \"malevolent\" by literary historian Mircea Anghelescu. At the other end of the political and cultural spectrum, Macedonski faced opposition from the intellectuals attracted to socialism, in particular \"Contemporanul\" editors Constantin Mille and Ioan Nădejde, with whom he was engaged in an extended polemic.\n\nIn the meantime, Macedonski published his own play, which had Cuza for its main character and was eponymously titled \"Cuza-Vodă\", and completed translations for \"Literatorul\"—from Maurice Rollinat, whom he helped impose as a main cultural reference in Romanian Symbolism, and from the Greek poet Akhillefs Paraskhos. In 1883, he also contributed his first sketch story, \"Casa cu nr. 10\" (\"The House at Number 10\"). In early 1883, he married Ana Rallet-Slătineanu. Wealthy and supposedly related to Romanian aristocrats, she would bear him five children in all: the painter Alexis was the eldest, followed by Nikita; the three youngest were two sons (Panel and Constantin Macedonski) and a daughter, Anna (also known as Nina). His heterosexual lifestyle notwithstanding, Macedonski remained a self-avowed admirer of male beauties, and was rumored to be a closeted homosexual.\n\nIn July 1883, Macedonski undertook one of his most controversial anti-\"Junimist\" actions. That month, \"Literatorul\" published an epigram signed with the pseudonym \"Duna\", deriding an unnamed author who had lost his mind. Mihai Eminescu—whom many had already come to see as Romania's national poet—had by then developed a mental disorder which had become known to the general public. Ever since that moment, Macedonski has generally been believed to be \"Duna\", and as a result, was faced with much criticism from both readers and commentators. The intense anti-\"Literatorul\" press campaign was initiated in August, when writer Grigore Ventura issued an article condemning Macedonski's attitude (published in the Bucharest-based newspaper \"L'Indépendance Roumaine\"), with Macedonski responding in the National Liberal organ \"Românul\". During one evening, Macedonski is reported to have been assaulted by anonymous supporters of Eminescu. His previous conflict with Nădejde was also affected by this renewed controversy: while opposed to \"Junimist\" policies, the socialists at \"Contemporanul\" voiced their admiration for Eminescu's art.\n\nLate in 1883, Macedonski and his friends unveiled Ion Georgescu's statue of their mentor Bolintineanu in the National Theater lobby. The circumstances in which this took place rose suspicion of foul play; on this grounds, Macedonski was ridiculed by his former friend Zamfirescu in the journal \"România Liberă\", which left him embittered. Călinescu proposes that, although such negative reactions were invoked by Macedonski's supporters as a sign of their mentor having been marginalized, Macedonski had expressed his dissatisfaction with the cultural environment long before that moment, and was still a respected figure even after the incidents took place.\n\nHaving been stripped of his administrative office by the new Brătianu cabinet, Macedonski faced financial difficulties, and was forced to move into a house on the outskirts of Bucharest, and later moved between houses in northern Bucharest. According to Călinescu, the poet continued to cultivate luxury and passionately invested in the decorative arts, although his source of income, other than the supposed assistance \"of [European] ruling houses\", remains a mystery. Arguing that Macedonski was \"always in need of money\" to use on his luxury items, poet Victor Eftimiu claimed: \"He did not shy away from sending emphatic notes to the potentates of his day [...], flattering some, threatening others. He would marry off or simply mate some of his disciples with aging and rich women, and then he would squeeze out their assets.\"\n\nMacedonski eventually left Romania in 1884, visiting Paris. On his way there, he passed through Craiova, where he met aspiring author Traian Demetrescu, whose works he had already hosted in \"Literatorul\" and who was to become his friend and protégé. Demetrescu later recalled being gripped by \"tremors of emotion\" upon first catching sight of Macedonski. In France, Macedonski set up contacts within the French literary environment, and began contributing to French or Francophone literary publications—including the Belgian Symbolist platforms \"La Wallonie\" and \"L'Élan littéraire\". His collaboration with \"La Wallonie\" alongside Albert Mockel, Tudor Vianu believes, makes Alexandru Macedonski one in the original wave of European Symbolists. This adaptation to Symbolism also drew on his marked Francophilia, which in turn complemented his tendencies toward cosmopolitanism. He became opposed to Carol I, who, in 1881, had been granted the Crown of the Romanian Kingdom. In addition to his admiration for Cuza and the 1848 Wallachian revolutionaries, the poet objected to the King's sympathy for France's main rival, the German Empire. In January 1885, after having returned from the voyage, he announced his retirement from public life, claiming that German influence and its exponents at \"Junimea\" had \"conquered\" Romanian culture, and repeating his claim that Eminescu lacked value.\n\nIn the meantime, \"Literatorul\" went out of print, although new series were still published at irregular intervals until 1904 (when it ceased being published altogether). The magazine was reportedly hated by the public, causing Macedonski, Stoenescu, Florescu, Urechia and educator Anghel Demetriescu to try to revive it as \"Revista Literară\" (\"The Literary Review\", published for a few months in 1885). The poet attempted to establish other magazines, all of them short-lived, and, in 1887, handed for print his Naturalist novella \"Dramă banală\" (\"Banal Drama\") while completing one of the most revered episodes in the \"Nights\" series, \"Noaptea de mai\" (\"May Night\"). Also in 1886, he worked on his other Naturalist novellas: \"Zi de august\" (\"August Day\"), \"Pe drum de poștă\" (\"On the Stagecoach Trail\"), \"Din carnetul unui dezertor\" (\"From the Notebook of a Deserter\"), \"Între cotețe\" (\"Amidst Hen Houses\") and the eponymous \"Nicu Dereanu\".\n\nBy 1888, he was again sympathetic toward Blaremberg, whose dissident National Liberal faction had formed an alliance with the Conservatives, editing \"Stindardul Țărei\" (later \"Straja Țărei\") as his supporting journal. However, late in the same year, he returned to the liberal mainstream, being assigned a weekly column in \"Românul\" newspaper. Two years later, he attempted to relaunch \"Literatorul\" under the leadership of liberal figure Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, but the latter eventually settled for founding his own \"Revista Nouă\". Around 1891, he saluted \"Junimea\"s own break with the Conservatives and its entry into politics at the Conservative-Constitutional Party, before offering an enthusiastic welcome to the 1892 \"Junimist\" agitation among university students. In 1894, he would speak in front of student crowds gathered at a political rally in University Square, and soon after made himself known for supporting the cause of ethnic Romanians and other underrepresented groups of Austria-Hungary.\n\nHis literary thesis of the time was titled \"Poezia viitorului\" (\"The Poetry of the Future\"). It upheld Symbolist authors as the models to follow, while Macedonski personally began producing what he referred to as \"instrumentalist\" poems, composed around musical and onomatopoeic elements, and showing a preference for internal rhymes. Such an experimental approach was soon after parodied and ridiculed by Ion Luca Caragiale, who had by then affiliated and parted with \"Junimea\", in his new \"Moftul Român\" magazine. The poet sought to reconcile with his rival, publicizing a claim that Caragiale was being unjustly ignored by the cultural establishment, but this attempt failed to mend relations between them, and the conflict escalated further.\n\nWhile, in 1893, \"Literatorul\" hosted fragments of \"Thalassa\" in its Romanian-language version, the author also launched a daily, \"Lumina\" (\"The Light\"). It was also at that stage that Alexandru Macedonski associated with Cincinat Pavelescu, the noted epigrammarian, who joined him in editing \"Literatorul\", and with whom he co-authored the 1893 verse tragedy depicting the Biblical hero Saul, and named after him. Although showcased by the National Theater with star actor Constantin Nottara in the title role, it failed to register success with the public. Two years later, the two \"Literatorul\" editors made headlines as pioneers of cycling. An enthusiastic promoter of the sport, Macedonski joined fellow poet Constantin Cantilli on a marathon, pedaling from Bucharest across the border into Austria-Hungary, all the way down to Brașov.\n\nMacedonski also returned with a new volume of poetry, \"Excelsior\" (consecutive editions in 1895 and 1896), and founded \"Liga Ortodoxă\" (\"The Orthodox League\"), a magazine noted for hosting the debut of Tudor Arghezi, later one of the most celebrated figures in Romanian literature. Macedonski commended his new protégé for reaching \"the summit of poetry and art\" at \"an age when I was still prattling verses\". \"Liga Ortodoxă\" also hosted articles against Caragiale, which Macedonski signed with the pseudonym \"Sallustiu\" (\"Sallustius\"). The magazine was additional proof of Macedonski's return to conservatism, and largely dedicated to defending the cause of Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan Ghenadie, deposed by the Romanian Synod following a political scandal. It defended Ghenadie up until he chose to resign, and subsequently went out of print. Macedonski was shocked to note that Ghenadie had given up his own defense.\n\nIn 1895, his \"Casa cu nr. 10\" was translated into French by the \"Journal des Débats\", whose editors reportedly found it picturesque. Two years later, Macedonski himself published French-language translations of his earlier poetry under the title \"Bronzes\", a volume prefaced by his disciple, the critic and promoter Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești. Although it was positively reviewed by \"Mercure de France\" magazine, \"Bronzes\" was largely unnoticed by the French audience, a fact which Tudor Vianu attributes to Bogdan-Pitești's lack of qualification for the cultural mission Macedonski had trusted him with. By that time, his circle had come to be frequented with regularity by Bogdan-Pitești's friend and collaborator, the celebrated painter Ștefan Luchian, who was in the Symbolist and Art Nouveau stage of his career.\nBy 1898, Macedonski was again facing financial difficulties, and his collaborators resorted to organizing a fundraiser in his honor. His rejection of the Orthodox establishment was documented by his political tract, published that year as \"\". Between that time and 1900, he focused on researching esoteric, occult and pseudoscientific subjects. Traian Demetrescu, who recorded his visits with Macedonski, recalled his former mentor being opposed to his positivist take on science, claiming to explain the workings of the Universe in \"a different way\", through \"imagination\", but also taking an interest in Camille Flammarion's astronomy studies. Macedonski was determined to interpret death through parapsychological means, and, in 1900, conferenced at the Atheneum on the subject \"Sufletul și viața viitoare\" (\"The Soul and the Coming Life\"). The focal point of his vision was that man could voluntarily stave off death with words and gestures, a concept he elaborated upon in his later articles. In one such piece, Macedonski argued: \"man has the power [...] to compact the energy currents known as thoughts to the point where he changes them, according to his own will, into objects or soul-bearing creatures.\" He also attempted to build a machine for extinguishing chimney fires. Later, Nikita Macedonski registered the invention of nacre-treated paper, which is sometimes attributed to his father.\n\nThe few issues of \"Literatorul\" that were printed in 1899-1900 saw the circle being joined by the young Symbolist poet Ștefan Petică. In 1902, he published \"Cartea de aur\" (\"The Golden Book\"), comprising his sketch stories and novellas. In parallel, Macedonski returned to the public scene, founding \"Forța Morală\" magazine. It was through this venue that he began responding to Ion Luca Caragiale's earlier attacks. This he did by hosting the articles of aspiring journalist Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion, who accused Caragiale of having plagiarized a Hungarian author by the name of Kemény in his tragedy play \"Năpasta\". Kemény turned out to be non-existent. According to Vianu, Macedonski had no prior knowledge of the fraud, but had also been \"blinded\" by his resentments instead of displaying \"discernment\", and had even showed evidence of \"insanity\". Most in Macedonski's own series of anti-Caragiale articles were unsigned, or signed with pseudonyms such as \"Luciliu\" (\"Gaius Lucilius\").\n\nLike in the case of Eminescu's conflict with Macedonski, the polemic enlisted a negative response from the public. The poet's associate Th. M. Stoenescu convinced himself that Caragiale was being framed, and refused to allow \"Revista Literară\" to be used for endorsing Caion, which caused Macedonski to shun him. Macedonski refused to withdraw his support for the cause even after Caragiale sued Caion, but \"Forța Morală\" soon went out of print. Before it did so, the journal hosted some of Macedonski's most renowned poems, including \"Lewki\" and \"Noaptea de decemvrie\" (\"December Night\"), together with his article on Remy de Gourmont's thoughts on poetics.\n\nIn his article of 1903, titled \"\" (\"Toward Occultism. Later Orientations toward Theosophy and Social Philosophy\"), the poet envisaged making his interest in esoteric subjects the basis of a new literary movement. Also that year, poet George Bacovia began attending the literary circle, and gave a reading of his celebrated \"Plumb\" poem, being welcomed by Macedonski with a flattering epigram. Macedonski's series of short-lived periodicals resumed in 1905, when he founded \"Le Beau Danube Bleu\" (French for \"The Beautiful Blue Danube\") and \"Liga Conservatoare\" (\"The Conservative League\"). He registered more success in 1906, when his \"Thalassa\" was published, as \"Le Calvaire de feu\", by Edward Sansot's Paris-based publishing house. This followed intense self-promotion within the French literary environment, as well as advertisements in the French press. Part of this involved Macedonski sending his book to be reviewed by Émile Faguet, Jean Mounet-Sully, Joséphin Péladan, Pierre Quillard and Jean Richepin, who replied with what Vianu deems \"the politeness of circumstance.\" The volume was nonetheless favorably reviewed by the prestigious magazines \"Mercure de France\" and \"Gil Blas\".\n\nAlso in 1906, \"La Revue Musicale\" published his interview with Combarieu, through which the latter aimed to verify supposed connections between literary inspiration and musical sensitivity. By 1907, he was concentrating on experiments in physics, and eventually publicized his claim to have discovered that light does not travel through vacuum. He sent a paper on astronomy subjects to be reviewed by the Société Astronomique de France, of which he subsequently became a member. The same year, he drafted the plan for a world government, announcing that he had found sympathy for the cause throughout Europe. Macedonski also introduced himself to an Italophone public, when two of his sonnets were published by \"Poesia\", the magazine of Futurist theorist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1912, Macedonski was again in Paris. Seeking to withdraw himself from Romania's public life due to what he perceived as injustice, he had by then completed work on the French-language tragicomedy \"Le Fou?\" (\"The Madman?\"), which was only published after his death. He was actively seeking to establish his reputation in French theater, reading his new play to a circle which included Louis de Gonzague Frick and Florian-Parmentier, while, at home, newspapers reported rumors that his work was going to be staged by Sarah Bernhardt's company. His efforts were largely fruitless, and, accompanied by his son Alexis, the poet left France, spent some time in Italy, and eventually returned to Romania. Passing through the German Empire, he learned of Ion Luca Caragiale's sudden death, and wrote \"Adevărul\" daily an open letter, which showed that he had come to revise his stance, notably comparing the deceased author's style and legacy to those of Mark Twain.\n\nDuring Macedonski's absence, his style and work had come to be reviewed more positively, in particular by the young authors I. Dragoslav, Horia Furtună, Ion Pillat, Anastasie Mândru, Al. T. Stamatiad, as well as by post-\"Junimist\" critic Mihail Dragomirescu, who offered Macedonski a good reception in his \"Convorbiri Critice\" magazine. Tudor Vianu, who cites contemporary statements by Dragoslav, concludes that, upon arrival, Macedonski was enthusiastically received by a public who had missed him. Also in 1912, one of his poems was published as an homage by \"Simbolul\", a magazine published by the young and radical Symbolists Tristan Tzara, Ion Vinea and Marcel Janco. Around that time, Macedonski also collaborated with the Iași-based moderate Symbolist magazine \"Versuri și Proză\". Polemics surrounding his case nevertheless continued: in late 1912, as part of a National Theater adaptation of Alphonse Daudet's \"Sapho\", actor Cazimir Belcot borrowed from Macedonski's appearance and mannerisms to portray a failure.\n\nMacedonski and his protégés had become regular frequenters of Bucharest cafés. Having a table permanently reserved for him at Imperial Hotel's Kübler Coffeehouse, he was later a presence in two other such establishments: High-Life and Terasa Oteteleșanu. He is said to have spent part of his time at Kübler loudly mocking the traditionalist poets who gathered at an opposite table. Meanwhile, the poet's literary club, set up at his house in Dorobanți quarter, had come to resemble a mystical circle, over which he held magisterial command. Vianu, who visited the poet together with Pillat, compares this atmosphere with those created by other \"mystics and magi of poetry\" (citing as examples Joséphin Péladan, Louis-Nicolas Ménard, Stéphane Mallarmé and Stefan George). The hall where seances were hosted was only lit by candles, and the tables were covered in red fabric. Macedonski himself was seated on a throne designed by Alexis, and adopted a dominant pose. The apparent secrecy and the initiation rites performed on new members were purportedly inspired by Rosicrucianism and the Freemasonry. By then, Macedonski was rewarding his followers' poems with false gemstones.\n\nThe poet founded \"Revista Critică\" (\"The Critical Review\"), which again closed after a short while, and issued the poetry volume \"Flori sacre\" (\"Sacred Flowers\"). Grouping his \"Forța Morală\" poems and older pieces, it was dedicated to his new generation of followers, whom Macedonski's preface referred to as \"the new Romania.\" He continued to hope that \"Le Fou?\" was going to be staged in France, especially after he received some encouragement in the form of articles in \"Mercure de France\" and \"Journal des Débats\", but was confronted with the general public's indifference. In 1914, \"Thalassa\" was published in a non-definitive version by Constantin Banu's magazine \"Flacăra\", which sought to revive overall interest in his work. At a French Red Cross conference in September, Macedonski paid his final public homage to France, which had just become entangled in World War I. It was also in 1914 that Macedonski commissioned for print his very first rondels and completed work on a tragedy play about Renaissance poet Dante Aligheri—known as \"La Mort de Dante\" in its French original, and \"Moartea lui Dante\" in the secondary Romanian version (both meaning \"Dante's Death\"). The aging poet was by then building connections with the local art scene: together with artist Alexandru Severin, he created (and probably presided over) \"Cenaclul idealist\" (\"The Idealist Club\"), which included Symbolist artists and was placed under the honorary patronage of King Carol.\n\n1916 was also the year when Romania abandoned her neutrality and, under a National Liberal government, rallied with the Entente Powers. During the neutrality period, Macedonski had shed his lifelong Francophilia to join the Germanophiles, who wanted to see Romanian participation on the Central Powers' side. In 1915, he issued the journal \"Cuvântul Meu\" (\"My Word\"). Entirely written by him, it published ten consecutive issues before going bankrupt, and notably lashed out against France for being \"bourgeois\" and \"lawyer-filled\", demanding from Romania not to get involved in the conflict. Commentators and researchers of his work have declared themselves puzzled by this change in allegiance.\n\nMacedonski further alienated public opinion during the Romanian Campaign, when the Central Powers armies entered southern Romania and occupied Bucharest. Alexis was drafted and became a war artist, but Macedonski Sr, who received formal protection from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bucharest, chose to stay behind while the authorities and many ordinary citizens relocated to Iași, where resistance was still being organized. His stance was interpreted as collaborationism by his critics. However, Macedonski reportedly faced extreme poverty throughout the occupation. Having by then begun to attend the circle of Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, his promoter and fellow Germanophile, he was once rewarded by the latter with a turkey filled with gold coins.\n\n\"Literatorul\" resumed print in June 1918, once Romania capitulated to the Central Powers under the Treaty of Bucharest. A controversial incident occurred soon afterwards, when, going against the counsel of his friend and collaborator Stamatiad, Macedonski signed a \"Literatorul\" article where the German military administrator August von Mackensen, who was about to lead his troops out of Romania, was presented in a positive light. In a manner deemed \"excessive\" by historian Lucian Boia, the Romanian writer was paying homage not just to Mackensen, but also, indirectly, to German Emperor Wilhelm II and the \"Reichsheer\". Soon after reading the piece, Romanian Academy member and fellow Symbolist promoter Ovid Densusianu withdrew his own nomination of Macedonski for an Academy seat. During summer, Macedonski also joined the group of public figures who saluted the senior Conservative Germanophile Petre P. Carp (deeming Carp \"the veteran of character, honesty and Romanianism\"), and, in September, joined Ioan Slavici and Gala Galaction as a contributor to the occupation magazine \"Rumänien in Wort und Bild\", where he prophesied an anti-French \"political renaissance\" of Romania.\n\nAlexandru Macedonski faced problems after the Romanian government resumed its control over Bucharest, and during the early years of Greater Romania. What followed the Mackensen article, Vianu claims, was Macedonski's \"bellum contra omnes\" (\"war against all\"). However, the poet made efforts to accommodate himself with the triumphal return of the Iași authorities: in December 1918, \"Literatorul\" celebrated the extension of Romanian rule \"from the Tisza to the Dniester\" as a success of the National Liberals, paying homage to Francophile political leaders Ion I. C. Brătianu and Take Ionescu. Macedonski also envisaged running in the 1918 election for a seat in the new Parliament (which was supposed to vote a document to replace the 1866 Constitution as the organic law), but never registered his candidature. According to Vianu, he had intended to create a joke political party, the \"intellectual group\", whose other member was an unnamed coffeehouse acquaintance of his. \"Literatorul\" was revived for a final time in 1919.\n\nHis health deteriorated from heart disease, which is described by Vianu as an effect of constant smoking. By that stage, Vianu recalls, Macedonski also had problems coming to terms with his age. His last anthumous work was the pamphlet \"Zaherlina\" (named after the Romanian version of \"Zacherlin\"; also known as \"Zacherlina\" or \"Zacherlina în continuare\", \"Zacherlin Contd.\"), completed in 1919 and published the following year. It notably attacked Densusianu, who had become Macedonski's personal enemy. Some other polemical texts he had authored late in life saw print only after his death, under the title \"Mustrări postume către o generație neînțelegătoare\" (\"Posthumous Reprimands for an Obtuse Generation\").\n\n1920 was also the year when the People's Party cabinet attempted to pension him off from his office at the Historical Monuments Commission, but the publicized protest of Macedonski's fellow writers in Bucharest made it reconsider. Confined to his home by illness and old age, Macedonski was still writing poems, some of which later known as his \"Ultima verba\" (\"Last Words\"). The writer died on November 24, at three o'clock in the afternoon. Having come to develop an addiction to floral fragrances, he was inhaling a rose petal extract during his last hours. He was buried in Bucharest's Bellu.\n\nAlthough Alexandru Macedonski frequently changed his style and views on literary matters, a number of constants have been traced throughout his work. Thus, a common perception is that his literature had a strongly visual aspect, the notion being condensed in Cincinat Pavelescu's definition of Macedonski: \"Poet, therefore painter; painter, therefore poet.\" Traian Demetrescu too recalled that his mentor had been dreaming of becoming a visual artist, and had eventually settled for turning his son Alexis into one. This pictorial approach to writing created parallels between Macedonski and his traditionalist contemporaries Vasile Alecsandri and Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea.\n\nFollowing the tenets of Dimitrie Bolintineanu and Théophile Gautier, the writer repeatedly called for purity in versification, and upheld it as an essential requirement, while progressively seeking to verify the quality of his poetry through phonaesthetics. A characteristic of Macedonski's style is his inventive use of Romanian. Initially influenced by Ion Heliade Rădulescu's introduction of Italian-based words to the Romanian lexis, Macedonski himself later infused poetic language with a large array of neologisms from several Romance sources. Likewise, Vianu notes, Macedonski had a tendency for comparing nature with the artificial, the result of this being a \"document\" of his values. Macedonski's language alternated neologisms with barbarisms, many of which were coined by him personally. They include \"claviculat\" (\"clavicled\", applied to a shoulder), \"împălăriată\" (\"enhatted\", used to define a crowd of hat-wearing tourists), and \"ureichii\" (instead of \"urechii\", \"to the ear\" or \"of the ear\"). His narratives nevertheless take an interest in recording direct speech, used as a method of characterization. However, Călinescu criticizes Macedonski for using a language which, \"although grammatically correct [...], seems to have been learned only recently\", as well as for not following other Romanian writers in creating a lasting poetic style.\n\nThe writer's belief in the effects of sheer willpower, notably present in his comments on esoteric subjects, was itself a defining characteristic of his perspective on literature. In 1882, he wrote about progression in one's career: \"We are all poets at birth, but only those who shape themselves through study will become poets.\" Vianu, who notes Macedonski's \"exclusivity\" and \"fanaticism\", places such statements in connection with Macedonski's personal ambition, \"pride\" and \"the willingness to carry out ventured actions [...], in stated opposition with the entire surrounding and with contempt for the foreseeable reaction.\"\n\nAlmost all periods of Macedonski's work reflect, in whole or in part, his public persona and the polemics he was involved in. George Călinescu's emits a verdict on the relation between his lifetime notoriety and the public's actual awareness of his work: \"Macedonski [was] a poet well-known for being an unknown poet.\" According to literary critic Matei Călinescu, the innovative aspects of his impact on Romanian literature were not as much related to his \"literary ideology\", as much as to his \"contradictory spirit\" and \"essential nonconformism\". However, literary researcher Adrian Marino proposes that Macedonski was one of the first modern authors to illustrate the importance of \"dialectic unity\" through his views on art, in particular by having argued that poetry needed to be driven by \"an idea\". Having theorized once, while questioning \"Junimist\" rigor, that \"the logic of poetry is \"absurdity\" itself [italics in the original]\", the poet also said: \"Poetry is the chaos of spirit and matter, of the cries of distress and mad laughter. From the sublime to the trivial, that is what it should be.\" He later revised part of this verdict, and, making explicit his adoption of aestheticism, spoke against trivial subjects and in favor of the sublime.\n\nWhile Macedonski also discarded the concept of \"social poetry\" not long after postulating it, its spirit, Tudor Vianu believes, can still be found in his later contributions. This, the critic notes, was owed to his \"social temperament\", whose \"fundamental experience is that of the social.\" Discussing this sociable and extrovert character, other critics see in the poet's life and work the imprint of \"quixotism\". Also according to Vianu, this contrasted with Macedonski's failures in communicating with the public, an experience which made him \"misanthropic\" and contributed to his ultimate vision of death as freedom. Literary historian Pompiliu Constantinescu concluded: \"Macedonski could not resign; his one martyrdom was for Art, as the sole liberation from a tormented life.\" Other commentators have defined the poet's perspective on life as a result of \"neurosis\".\n\nIn Vianu's perspective, Macedonski's stance is dominated by a mixture of nostalgia, sensuality, lugubrious-grotesque imagery, and \"the lack of bashfulness for antisocial sentiments\" which compliments his sarcasm. In respect to the latter characteristic, Vianu notes \"no one in Romanian literature has laughed the same way as Macedonski\", whereas critic Ștefan Cazimir argues: \"[Macedonski was] lacking the sense of relativity in principles, and implicitly a sense of humor.\" Cazimir adds: \"Only when he aged did [Macedonski] learn to smile\". George Călinescu himself believes Macedonski to have been \"fundamentally a spiritual man with lots of humor\", speculating that he was able to see the \"uselessness\" of his own scientific ventures.\n\nCritics note that, while Macedonski progressed from one stage to the other, his work fluctuated between artistic accomplishment and mediocrity. Tudor Vianu believes \"failure in reaching originality\" and reliance on \"soppy-conventional attributes of the day\" to be especially evident wherever Macedonski tried to emulate epic poetry. He also notes that Macedonski's love-themed pieces \"cannot be listed among [his] most fortunate\". At his best, commentators note, he was one of the Romanian literature's classics. Macedonski is thus perceived as the author second only to Eminescu, and as his ideal counterpart—a relation Vianu describes as \"the internal dualism [confronting] two familiar gods\". Various critics have compared Eminescu's poetic discourse with that of the Symbolist leader, concluding that the two poets often display very similar attitudes. Călinescu writes that, while Macedonski's work is largely inferior to that of his \"Junimist\" rival, it forms the best \"reply\" ever conceived within their common setting.\n\nWith Ion Catina, Vasile Păun and Grigore H. Grandea, young Macedonski belonged to late Romanian Romanticism, part of a Neoromantic generation which had for its mentors Heliade Rădulescu and Bolintineanu. Other early influences were Pierre-Jean de Béranger and Gottfried August Bürger, together with Romanian folklore, motifs from them being adapted by Macedonski into pastorals and ballades of ca. 1870-1880. The imprint of Romanticism and such other sources was evident in \"Prima verba\", which groups pieces that Macedonski authored in his early youth, the earliest of them being written when he was just twelve. Critics generally argue that the volume is without value. The poems display his rebellious attitude, self-victimization and strong reliance on autobiographical elements, centering on such episodes as the death of his father. In one piece inspired by the ideology of Heliade Rădulescu, Vianu notes, Macedonski sings \"the French Revolution's love for freedom and equality, otherwise proclaimed from his nobleman's perspective.\" It reads:\nIn parallel, Macedonski used erotic themes, completing a series which, although written on the model of idylls, is noted for its brute details of sexual exploits. The poet probably acknowledged that posterity would reject them, and did not republish them in any of his collected poetry volumes.\n\nDuring his time at \"Oltul\" (1873–1875), Macedonski published a series of poems, most of which were not featured in definitive editions of his work. In addition to odes written in the Italian-based version of Romanian, it includes lyrics which satirize Carol I without mentioning his name. Following his arrest, Macedonski also completed \"Celula mea de la Văcărești\" (\"My Cell in Văcărești\"), which shows his attempt to joke about the situation. In contrast to this series, some of the pieces written during Macedonski's time in the Budjak and Northern Dobruja display a detachment from contemporary themes. At that stage, he was especially inspired by Lord Byron, whom Vianu calls \"the sovereign poet of [Macedonski's] youth.\" In \"Calul arabului\", Macedonski explores exotic and Levantine settings, using symbols which announce George Coșbuc's \"El-Zorab\", and the Venetian-themed \"Ithalo\", which centers on episodes of betrayal and murder. Others were epic and patriotic in tone, with subjects such as Romanian victories in the Russo-Turkish War or the Imperial Roman sites along the Danube. One of these pieces, titled \"Hinov\" after the village and stone quarry in Rasova, gives Macedonski a claim to being the first modern European poet to have used free verse, ahead of the French Symbolist Gustave Kahn. Macedonski himself later voiced the claim, and referred to such a technique as \"symphonic verse\", \"proteic verse\", or, in honor of composer Richard Wagner, \"Wagnerian verse\".\n\nWhile editing \"Oltul\", Macedonski also completed his first prose writings. These were the travel account \"Pompeia și Sorento\" (\"Pompeia and Sorento\", 1874) and a prison-themed story described by Vianu as \"a tearjerker\", titled \"Câinele din Văcărești\" (\"The Dog in Văcărești\", 1875). These were later complemented by other travel works, which critic Mihai Zamfir likens to the verbal experiments of Impressionist literature, pioneering in the Romanian prose poetry genre. The short comedy \"Gemenii\" was his debut work for the stage, but, according to Vianu, failed to show any merit other than a \"logical construction\" and a preview into Macedonski's use of sarcasm. These writings were followed in 1876 by a concise biography of Cârjaliul, an early 19th-century hajduk. In line with his first Levant-themed poems, Macedonski authored the 1877 story \"Așa se fac banii\" (\"This Is How Money Is Made\", later retold in French as \"Comment on devient riche et puissant\", \"How to Become Rich and Powerful\"), a fable of fatalism and the Muslim world—it dealt with two brothers, one hard-working and one indolent, the latter of whom earns his money through a series of serendipitous events. Likewise, his verse comedy \"Iadeș!\" borrowed its theme from the widely circulated collection of Persian literature known as \"Sindipa\". The setting was however modern, and, as noted by French-born critic Frédéric Damé, the plot also borrowed much from Émile Augier's \"Gabrielle\" and from other morality plays of the period. Part of the text was an ironic treatment of youth in liberal professions, an attitude which Macedonski fitted in his emerging anti-bourgeois discourse.\n\nWith the first poems in his \"Nights\" cycle, Macedonski still showed his allegiance to Romanticism, and in particular to Alphonse de Lamartine, and the supposed inventor of this theme, Alfred de Musset. \"Noaptea de noiembrie\" opens with a violent condemnation of his adversaries, and sees Macedonski depicting his own funeral. The poem is commended by Călinescu, who notes that, in contrast to the \"apparently trivial beginning\", the main part, where Macedonski depicts himself in flight over the Danube, brings the Romanian writer close to the accomplishments of Dante Aligheri. The writer himself claimed that the piece evidenced \"the uttermost breath of inspiration I have ever felt in my life.\" Another poem, \"Noaptea de aprilie\" (\"April Night\"), was probably his testimony of unrequited love for Aristizza Romanescu.\n\nBy the 1880s, Macedonski developed and applied his \"social poetry\" theory, as branch of Realism. Explained by the writer himself as a reaction against the legacy of Lamartine, it also signified his brief affiliation with the Naturalist current, a radical segment of the Realist movement. Traian Demetrescu thus noted that Macedonski cherished the works of French Naturalists and Realists such as Gustave Flaubert and Émile Zola. During this phase, Macedonski made known his sympathy for the disinherited, from girls forced into prostitution to convicts sentenced to penal labor on salt mines, and also spoke out against the conventionalism of civil marriages. His \"Ocnele\" (\"The Salt Mines\") includes the verdict:\nNaturalist depiction was also the main element in his prose pieces of the early 1880s. Among them was the first of several sketch stories using still life techniques, \"Casa cu nr. 10\" (according to Zamfir, a prime sample of Macedonski's \"ornamental\" genre). With \"Între cotețe\", \"Dramă banală\" and later \"Cometa lui Odorescu\" (\"Odorescu's Comet\"), Macedonski speaks about his own biography. The former has for a protagonist Pandele Vergea, a thirty-five-year-old man who is consumed by an avicultural obsession, who dreams of turning into a bird, and who is eventually maimed by his overcrowded fowls. In contrast, Dereanu is a bohemian university student, possessed by dreams of military and political glory, and who meditates about his future in front of Heliade Rădulescu's statue or in Bucharest cafés. Also a bohemian, Odorescu announces his discovery of a comet, before being proved wrong by his aunt, an ordinary woman. Some pieces also double as memoirs: in \"Dramă banală\", the plot revolves around Macedonski's recollection of the 1866 plebiscite. Vianu draws attention to the picturesque depiction of historic Bucharest, a contributing element in \"Cometa...\", \"Casa cu nr. 10\" and \"Între cotețe\".\n\nWith \"Unchiașul Sărăcie\" (also written in verse), Macedonski took Naturalist tenets into the field of drama. Frédéric Damé believed it an imitation of a play by Ernest d'Hervilly and Alfred Grévin, but, Vianu argues, the Romanian text was only loosely based on theirs: in Macedonski's adaptation, the theme became fairy tale-like, and used a speech style based on Romanian folklore. Around the time of its completion, Macedonski was also working on a similarly loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", which notably had the two protagonists die in each other's arms. Another such play is \"3 decemvrie\" (\"December 3\"), which partly retells Friedrich Ludwig Zacharias Werner's \"Der 24 Februar\" using Naturalist devices. By contrast, the homage-play \"Cuza-Vodă\" is mainly a Romantic piece, where Alexander John Cuza finds his political mission validated by legendary figures in Romanian history.\n\nIn parallel, Macedonski was using poetry to carry out his polemics. In an 1884 epigram, he reacted against Alecsandri's \"Fântâna Blanduziei\", but, in Vianu's definition, \"his regular causticity seems to be restrained.\" The piece he had earlier written, presumably against Eminescu, scandalized the public by mocking the rival's mental ruin:\nAccording to Tudor Vianu, Macedonski was mostly motivated by his disappointment in \"Junimea\", and in particular by Eminescu's response to his public persona. Vianu contends that, although Macedonski \"never was familiar with the resigned and patient attitudes\", he was \"by no means an evil man.\" On one occasion, the poet defended himself against criticism, noting that the epigram had not been specifically addressed to Eminescu, but had been labeled as such by the press, and claiming to have authored it years before its \"Literatorul\" edition. However, the later piece \"Viața de apoi\" (\"The Afterlife\") still displays resentments he harbored toward Eminescu.\n\nBy 1880-1884, particularly after the Eminescu scandal, Macedonski envisaged prioritizing French as his language of expression. According to Vianu, Macedonski had traversed \"the lowest point\" of his existence, and had been subject to \"one of the most delicate mysteries of poetic creation.\" Among his pieces of the period is the French-language sonnet \"Pârle, il me dit alors\" (\"Speak, He Then Said to Me\"), where, Vianu notes, \"one discovers the state of mind of a poet who decides to expatriate himself.\"\n\nAccording to Mihai Zamfir, at the end of his transition from the \"mimetic and egocentric\" verse to Symbolist poetry, Macedonski emerged a \"remarkable, often extraordinary\" author. In the early 20th century, fellow poet and critic N. Davidescu described Macedonski, Ion Minulescu and other Symbolists from Wallachia as distinct from their Moldavian counterparts in both style and themes. Endorsing the theory and practice of Symbolism for much of his life, Macedonski retrospectively claimed to have been one of its first exponents. His version of Symbolism, critic Paul Cernat notes, clashed with that advocated by many of his contemporaries in that it rejected merit to the Decadent movement, and represented the \"decorative\" aestheticist trend of Paranassian spirit within the Romanian Symbolist current.\n\nWithin \"Poezia viitorului\", Macedonski invoked as his models to follow some important or secondary Symbolist and Parnassian figures: Charles Baudelaire, Joséphin Péladan, Maurice Maeterlinck, Stéphane Mallarmé and Jean Moréas. In his review of \"Bronzes\" for \"Mercure de France\", Pierre Quillard remarked the \"irreproachable\" technique, but criticized the poet for being too indebted to both Baudelaire and Leconte de Lisle; other Symbolist figures whom Macedonski is known to have borrowed from are José María de Heredia and Iwan Gilkin. While undergoing this transition, to what linguist Manuela-Delia Suciu argues is a mostly Parnassian phase, Macedonski was still referencing Naturalism, and considered it compatible with Symbolism.\n\nWith the adoption of such tenets came a succession of Symbolist poems, where the focus is on minutely-observed objects, usually items of luxury, partly reflecting themes he had explored in the Naturalist stage. Commenting on them, Tudor Vianu argues that no such works had ever been produced in Romanian literature up until that moment. In his \"Ospățul lui Pentaur\" (\"The Feast of Pentaur\"), the poet reflected on civilization itself, as reflected in inanimate opulence. The motif was also developed in descriptive prose fragments later grouped in \"Cartea de aur\", collectively titled \"nuvele fără oameni\" (\"novellas without people\") and compared by Călinescu with the paintings of Theodor Aman.\n\nAlso during that stage, Macedonski was exploring the numerous links between Symbolism, mysticism and esotericism. Earlier pieces had already come to explore macabre themes characteristic for an early branch of Symbolism. Influenced by Maurice Rollinat, they include the somber \"Vaporul morții\" (\"The Ship of Death\") and \"Visul fatal\" (\"The Fatal Dream\"). Likewise, the piece titled \"Imnul lui Satan\" (\"Satan's Hymn\") was placed by critics in connection with \"Les Litanies de Satan\" (part of Baudelaire's \"Les Fleurs du mal\"), but, Vianu argues, the source of Macedonski's satanic themes may have been lodged in his own vision of the world. This interest also reflected in his 1893 \"Saul\", where Cincinat Pavelescu's contribution is supposedly minimal. Echoing satanic themes, Ernest Legouvé's dramatic version of the \"Medea\" myth (which Macedonski translated at some point in his life) and the classical work of Jean Racine, it shows the dark powers of political conflict intervening between the eponymous king and his \"ephebos\"-like protégé David, the latter of whom turns out to be the agent of spiritual revolution.\n\n\"\" (\"August Night\"), outlines a monistic belief probably inspired by Rosicrucianism, stressing the unity between soul and matter and depicting Macedonski's own journey into a transcendental space. Following the examples of Baudelaire's \"Les paradis artificiels\", but also echoing his readings from Paul Verlaine and Théophile Gautier, Macedonski left poems dealing with narcotics and substance abuse, at least some of which reflected his personal experience with nicotine and possibly other unnamed drugs. Also at that stage, Macedonski also began publishing the \"instrumentalist\" series of his Symbolist poems. This form of experimental poem was influenced by the theories of René Ghil and verified through his encounter with Remy de Gourmont's views. In parallel, it reaffirmed Macedonski's personal view that music and the spoken word were intimately related (a perspective notably attested by his 1906 interview with Jules Combarieu). Romanian critic Petre Răileanu theorized that such elements evidenced Macedonski's transition to \"metaliterature\". On a different level, they echoed an older influence, that of Gottfried August Bürger.\n\nDespite having stated his interest in innovation, Macedonski generally displayed a more conventional style in his \"Excelsior\" volume. It included \"Noaptea de mai\", which Vianu sees as \"one of the [vernacular's] most beautiful poems\" and as evidence of \"a clear joy, without any torment whatsoever\". A celebration of spring partly evoking folkloric themes, it was made famous by the recurring refrain, \"Veniți: privighetoarea cântă și liliacul e-nflorit\" (\"Come along: the nightingale is singing and the lilac is in blossom\"). Like \"Noaptea de mai\", \"Lewki\" (named after and dedicated to the Snake Island), depicts intense joy, completed in this case by what Vianu calls \"the restorative touch of nature.\" The series also returned to Levant settings and Islamic imagery, particularly in \"Acșam dovalar\" (named after the Turkish version of \"Witr\"). Also noted within the volume is his short \"Modern Psalms\" series, including the piece \"Iertare\" (\"Forgiveness\"), which is addressed to God:\n\"Excelsior\" also included \"Noaptea de ianuarie\" (\"January Night\"), which encapsulates one of his best-known political statements. Anghelescu reads it as a \"meditation on disillusionment that culminates in a vitality-laden exhortation of action.\" Its anti-bourgeois attitude, literary historian Z. Ornea argues, was one of the meeting points between Macedonski and \"Junimism\". In what is seen as its most acid section, the text notably reads:\nAt the same time as being engaged in his most violent polemics, Macedonski produced meditative and serene poems, which were later judged to be among his best. \"Noaptea de decemvrie\" is the synthesis of his main themes and influences, rated by commentators as his \"masterpiece\". Partly based on an earlier poem (\"Meka\", named after the Arab city), it tells the story of an emir, who, left unsatisfied by the shallow and opulent life he leads in Baghdad, decides to leave on pilgrimage. While critics agree that it is to be read as an allegory of Macedonski's biography, the ironic text does not make it clear whether the emir actually reaches his target, nor if the central metaphor of Mecca as a mirage means that the goal is not worth sacrificing for. While Mircea Anghelescu comments that Macedonski illustrates \"unusual tension\" by rigorously amplifying references to the color red, seen as a symbol of suffering, Călinescu notes that the sequence of lyrics has a studied \"delirious\" element, and illustrates this with the quote:\nIn prose, his focus shifted back to the purely descriptive, or led Alexandru Macedonski into the realm of fantasy literature. These stories, most of which were eventually collected in \"Cartea de aur\", include memoirs of his childhood in the Amaradia region, nostalgic portrayals of the Oltenian boyar environment, idealized depictions of Cuza's reign, as well as a retrospective view on the end of Rom slavery (found in his piece \"Verigă țiganul\", \"Verigă the Gypsy\"). The best-known among them is \"Pe drum de poștă\", a third-person narrative and thinly disguised memoir, where the characters are an adolescent Alexandru Macedonski and his father, General Macedonski. The idyllic outlook present in such stories is one of the common meeting points between his version of Symbolism and traditionalist authors such as Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea. Vianu indicates the connection, but adds: \"Macedonski descended, through memory, in the world of the village, with the tremor of regret for the peace and plenty of the old settlements, so well polished that each person, landowner as well as peasant, lived within a framework that nature itself seemed to have granted. [...] in depicting rural environments, Macedonski presents the point of view of a conservative.\"\n\n\"Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu\", a fantasy novel and extended prose poem, was celebrated by Macedonski's disciple Oreste Georgescu as \"the new religion of humanity\". The volume carried the mocking dedication \"To France, this Chaldea\" (thought by Vianu to reference Péladan's views on the decay of civilization). It has affinities with writings by the Italian Decadent author Gabriele d'Annunzio, as well as echoes from Anatole France. The hero Thalassa, a Greek boy, works as a lighthouse-keeper on Snake Island, fantasizing about the golden age of mankind. His fate is changed by a shipwreck, during which a girl, Caliope, reaches the island's shore. Thalassa and Caliope fall in love, but are mysteriously unable to seal their union through sexual intercourse: the boy attributes this failure to the \"curse\" of human individuality. Seeking to achieve a perfect union with his lover, he eventually kills her and drowns himself in the Black Sea.\n\nIn her review for \"Mercure de France\", novelist Rachilde argued: \"Very difficult to read, entirely developed in Symbolist manner [and] almost impossible to recount, obviously written in French but nevertheless obviously conceived by a Romanian (and what a spirited Romanian!).\" Rachilde believed the work to display \"the fragrance of Oriental spices [...] rose marmalade and a slice of bear meat.\" According to Vianu, the book builds on Macedonski's earlier themes, replacing Naturalist observation with a metaphysical speculation about idealism. One other aspect of Macedonski's stylistic exploration took him to attempt recording synesthesia. His manuscript is written in ink of several colors, which, he believed, was to help readers get a full sense of its meaning. Like other synesthetic aspects of his novel, this is believed to have been inspired by the techniques of Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud.\n\n\"Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu\" is noted for its numerous cultural references, and especially for using a wide range of metaphors. Such aspects have been reviewed negatively by modern critics. Tudor Vianu writes: \"the poet makes such waste of gemstones that we feel like saying some of them must be false\", while Călinescu, who notes that some fragments reveal \"an incomparable artist\" and \"a professional metaphorist\", notes that \"in the end, such virtuosities become a bore.\" According to Manuela-Delia Suciu, \"Thalassa\" is \"prolix\" and \"too polished\", traits believed by Zamfir to be less irritating in the Romanian version. Critic Cornel Moraru found that, in the background, \"Thalassa\", a \"great Symbolist novel\", confronts Ancient Greek and Christian mythology, but \"abuses\" the religious vocabulary. Another part of the novel's imagery is erotic, and includes an elaborate and aestheticized description of male genitalia.\n\nThe four-act tragicomedy \"Le Fou?\" is seen by Vianu as comparable in subject matter and depth to \"Enrico IV\", a celebrated 1922 play by Luigi Pirandello. The plot reflects Macedonski's confrontation with his critics, and his acceptance of the fact that people saw in him an eccentric. The central figure is a banker, Dorval, who identifies himself with Napoleon Bonaparte to the point where he sees episodes in his biography as mirrors of early 19th-century battles. Unlike patients with dissociative identity disorder, Dorval does not actually imagine his life has become Napoleon's, but rather joins with him on an intellectual level. Witnesses of this disorder are divided into family, who seek to have Dorval committed, and close friends, who come to see his take on life as a manifestation of genius. The spectator is led to believe that the latter interpretation is the correct one. At a larger level, Vianu indicates, the play is also Macedonski's critique of capitalism, and, using Parisian argot, makes allusive references to famous people of the day.\n\nParticularly during the 1890s, Macedonski was a follower of Edgar Allan Poe and of Gothic fiction in general, producing a Romanian version of Poe's \"Metzengerstein\" story, urging his own disciples to translate other such pieces, and adopting \"Gothic\" themes in his original prose. Indebted to Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, Macedonski also wrote a number of science fiction stories, including the 1913 \"Oceania-Pacific-Dreadnought\", which depicts civilization on the verge of a crisis. The gigantic commercial ship is maintained by a banker's union, and designed to grant travelers access to every pleasure imaginable; this causes the working-class inhabited cities on the continent to fall into a state of neglect and permanent violence, the climax of the story occurring with the bankers' decision to destroy their creation. \"Oceania-Pacific-Dreadnought\" is noted for anticipating television, the ship being equipped with electrically-operated \"large and clear mirrors\" that display \"images from various parts of the Earth\". Macedonski was by then interested in the development of cinema, and authored a silent film screenplay based on \"Comment on devient riche et puissant\".\n\nLate in his life, Macedonski had come to reject Symbolist tenets, defining them as \"imbecilities\" designed for \"the uncultured\". \"Ultima verba\", the very last poems to be written by him, show him coming to terms with himself, and are treasured for their serene or intensely joyous vision of life and human accomplishment. The rondels written at this stage, known collectively as \"Poema rondelurilor\", are one of the first instances where the technique is used locally. Like those written previously by \"Literatorul\"s Pavelescu and Alexandru Obedenaru, they are based on an earlier motif present in Macedonski's work, that of recurring refrains. Many of the pieces document the poet's final discoveries. One of them is \"Rondelul crinilor\" (\"The Rondel of the Lilies\"), which proclaims fragrances as the source of beatitude: \"În crini e beția cea rară\", \"In lilies one finds that exceptional drunkenness\". According to Ștefan Cazimir, \"Rondelul orașului mic\" (\"The Rondel of the Small Town\") shows a \"likable wave of irony and self-irony\", and the poet himself coming to terms with \"the existence of a world who ignores him.\" Proof of his combativeness was still to be found in \"Rondelul contimporanilor\" (\"The Rondel of the Contemporaries\").\n\nThe poet's take on life is also outlined in his final play, \"Moartea lui Dante\". Călinescu writes that, by then, Macedonski was \"obsessed\" with the \"Divine Comedy\". Macedonski identifies with his hero, Dante Aligheri, and formulates his own poetic testament while identifying World War I Romania with the medieval Republic of Florence. Tudor Vianu remarks: \"In Dante's great self-pride, Macedonski found his own.\" He sees the play as the best such work to have been produced by Macedonski, whereas Călinescu deems it \"puerile\". Zamfir believes \"Moartea...\" to be a significant text in Macedonski's bibliography, \"one of the first samples of Romanian Symbolist theater\", and as such indebted mainly to Maeterlinck. Vianu argues that the play may document the Romanian writer's late rejection of France, through the protagonist's statement: \"the French are a gentle people, but their soul is different from mine.\"\n\nA number of rondels show Macedonski's late fascination with the Far East, China and Japan. George Călinescu believes that this is to be understood as one item in a large antithesis, the other being Decadent Paris, which one rondel describes as \"hell\". The Orient, viewed as the space of serenity, is believed by Macedonski to be peopled by toy-like women and absent opium-smokers, and to be kept orderly by a stable meritocracy. The Chinese-themed poem \"Tsing-Ly-Tsi\", which Cazimir notes for its discreet, \"almost imperceptible\", humor, reads:\n\nAlexandru Macedonski repeatedly expressed the thought that, unlike his contemporaries, posterity would judge him a great poet. With the exception of Mihail Dragomirescu, conservative literary critics tended to ignore Macedonski while he was alive. The first such figure was \"Junimea\"s Titu Maiorescu, who believed him to be a minor author, referring to him only a couple of times in his books and usually ridiculing him in his articles. One of these texts, the 1886 essay \"Poeți și critici\" (\"Poets and Critics\"), spoke of Macedonski as having \"vitiated\" poetry, a notion he also applied to Constantin D. Aricescu and Aron Densușianu. Especially radical pronouncements were left by the traditionalist authors Ilarie Chendi and Nicolae Iorga. Chendi wrote of Macedonski being \"the caricature of a man\", having \"a feverish mind\" and being motivated by \"the brutal instinct of revenge\". Iorga, who became better known as a historian, later retracted some of the statements he had made against the poet during the 1890s. Among the younger prominent traditionalist writers was the Transylvanian-born Lucian Blaga, who may have purposefully avoided Macedonski during his first visit to Bucharest in 1920. Although more sympathetic to the Symbolist author, both Dragomirescu and Gheorghe Adamescu tended to describe him as exclusively the product of French and Decadent literature, while Dragomirescu's disciple Ion Trivale denied all merit to Macedonski's literature.\n\nAccording to Tudor Vianu, Macedonski's intellectual friends (among them Anghel Demetriescu, George Ionescu-Gion, Bonifaciu Florescu, Grigore Tocilescu and V. A. Urechia) were largely responsible for passing down \"a better and truer image of the abused poet.\" It was also due to Dragomirescu that \"Noaptea de decemvrie\" was included in a literature textbook for final grade high school students, which some argue is the poet's first-ever presence in the Romanian curriculum. According to historian Lucian Nastasă, the poet's wife Ana Rallet behaved like an \"excellent secretary\" while Macedonski was still alive, and thereafter helped sort and edit his manuscript while maintaining \"an actual cult\" for her husband.\n\nMacedonski's cosmopolitan circle was the center of a literary alternative to the prevailing conservatism and Eminescu-like traditionalism of the day, the latter tendency being grouped around \"Sămănătorul\" magazine for part of Macedonski's lifetime. While Macedonski himself maintained his links with Romanticism and Classicism, commentators have retrospectively recognized in him the main person who announced Romania's first wave in modernist literature. Many first-generation disciples were to part with his guidelines early on, either by radicalizing their Symbolism or by stepping out of its confines. Traian Demetrescu was one of the first to do so, focusing on his commitment to socialism—Vianu notes that the split took place \"without coldness and the heart's versatility\" on Macedonski's part. Literary researcher Lidia Bote argues that it was Petică who first illustrated mature Symbolism, emancipating himself from Macedonski's eclectic tendencies after 1902. By that time, the Symbolist authors Dimitrie Anghel and N. D. Cocea used Macedonski's fantasy prose as an inspiration for their own, and N. Davidescu was borrowing from his mystical discourse. The pictorial and joyous elements in Macedonski's poems were also serving to inspire Stamatiad, Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est and Horia Furtună. In the early stages of his career, Ion Pillat wrote pieces which echo his master's choice of exotic themes. A more discreet legacy of Macedonski's ideas was also preserved inside the conservative and traditionalist camps. Although his separation from \"Literatorul\" was drastic, and led him to rally with \"Junimea\", Duiliu Zamfirescu built on some elements borrowed from the magazine's ideology, incorporating them into his literary vision.\n\nMany of Macedonski's most devoted disciples, whom he himself had encouraged, have been rated by various critics as secondary or mediocre. This is the case of Theodor Cornel (who made his name as an art critic), Mircea Demetriade, Oreste Georgescu, Alexandru Obedenaru, Stoenescu, Stamatiad, Carol Scrob, Dumitru Karnabatt and Donar Munteanu. Another such minor author was the self-styled \"hermeticist\" Alexandru Petroff, who expanded on Macedonski's ideas about esoteric knowledge.\n\nMacedonski's eldest son Alexis continued to pursue a career as a painter. His son Soare followed in his footsteps, receiving acclaim from art critics of the period. Soare's short career ended in 1928, before he turned nineteen, but his works have been featured in several retrospective exhibitions, including one organized by Alexis. Alexis later experimented with scenic design as an assistant to French filmmaker René Clair; his later life, shrouded in mystery and intrigue, led him to a career in Fascist Italy and Francoist Spain. Another of Alexandru Macedonski's sons, Nikita, was also a poet and painter. For a while in the 1920s, he edited the literary supplement of \"Universul\" newspaper. Two years after her father's death, Anna Macedonski married poet Mihail Celarianu.\n\nIn addition to his polemical portrayals in works by Alecsandri, Eminescu and Caragiale, Macedonski's career was an inspiration for various authors. His image acquired mythical proportions for his followers. Like Demetrescu, many of them left memoirs on Macedonski which were published before or after his death. His admirers were writing poetry about him as early as 1874, and, in 1892, Cincinat Pavelescu published a rhapsodizing portrait of Macedonski as \"the Artist\". Pavelescu, Dragoslav and Petică paid homage to the writer by leaving recollections which describe him as a devoted and considerate friend. In contrast, traditionalist poet Alexandru Vlahuță authored an 1889 sketch story in which Macedonski (referred to as \"Polidor\") is the object of derision.\n\nActual recognition of the poet as a classic came only in the interwar period. A final volume of never before published poems, \"Poema rondelurilor\", saw print in 1927. Macedonski's work was analyzed and popularized by a new generation of critics, among them Vianu and George Călinescu. The post-\"Junimist\" modernist critic Eugen Lovinescu also commented favorably on Macedonski's work, but overall, Călinescu asserts, his opinions on the subject gave little insight into what he actually thought about the poet. He also recounts that Macedonski himself treated Lovinescu with disdain, and once called him \"a canary\".\n\nThe emerging avant-garde, although originating from Symbolism, progressively took its distance from \"Literatorul\"s legacy. Initially, Macedonski's contribution to experimental literature was continued within formal Symbolism by his disciples Demetriade, Iuliu Cezar Săvescu and Ion Minulescu. The latter was particularly indebted to Macedonski in matters of vision and language. In 1904, Tudor Arghezi also left behind the \"Literatorul\" circle and its tenets, eventually arriving to the fusion of modernist, traditionalist and avant-garde elements. However, he remained indebted to Macedonski's example in his descriptive prose. The 1912 \"Simbolul\" magazine, which moved between conventional Symbolism and the emerging avant-garde, also published an Imagist-inspired parody of \"Noaptea de mai\", signed by Adrian Maniu. A co-founder of Dadaism during the late 1910s, Tristan Tzara is believed by Swedish researcher Tom Sandqvist to have been inspired more or less directly by Macedonski, and in particular by the latter's thoughts on the relation between absurdity and poetry. In his debut poems, Benjamin Fondane-Barbu Fundoianu occasionally followed Macedonski, but, by 1920, stated that the Symbolist doyen merely imitated French models to the point of \"parasitism\".\n\nSeveral avant-garde authors returned to Macedonski's literary guidelines by the late 1920s, as they themselves grew more moderate. This was the case of Maniu and Ion Vinea, both of whom published prose works in the line of \"Thalassa\". The same work is also believed to have influenced two non-avant-garde authors, Davidescu and Mateiu Caragiale, who remained close to the tenets Symbolism. Mateiu was the illegitimate son of Ion Luca Caragiale, but, Vianu notes, could withstand comparisons with his father's rival: the eccentricities were complementary, although Mateiu Caragiale shied away from public affairs. In the same post-Symbolist generation, Celarianu (Macedonski's posthumous son-in-law), George Bacovia and Păstorel Teodoreanu also built on Macedonski's legacy, being later joined in this by the Bessarabian linguist Eugenio Coșeriu (who, in his early poetic career, imitated Macedonski's rondel style). In the late 1920s, when their form of modern psalms inspired Albanian-Romanian poet Aleksander Stavre Drenova, Macedonski and Arghezi both made an indirect impact on Albanian literature.\n\nMacedonski's status as one of Romanian literature's greats was consolidated later in the 20th century. By this time, \"Noaptea de decemvrie\" had become one of the most recognizable literary works to be taught in Romanian schools. During the first years of Communist Romania, the Socialist Realist current condemned Symbolism (\"see Censorship in Communist Romania\"), but spoke favorably of Macedonski's critique of the bourgeoisie. A while after this episode, Marin Sorescu, one of the best-known modernist poets of his generation, wrote a homage-parody of the \"Nights\" cycle. Included in the volume \"Singur între poeți\" (\"Alone among Poets\"), it is seen by critic Mircea Scarlat as Sorescu's most representative such pieces. Also then, \"Noaptea de decemvrie\" partly inspired Ștefan Augustin Doinaș' ballad \"Mistrețul cu colți de argint\".\n\nIn the 1990s, Ștefan Agopian took the \"Nights\" cycle as inspiration for an erotic short story, while Pavel Șușară adapted his rondels to a modernized setting. Macedonski's prose also influenced younger writers such as Angelo Mitchievici and Anca Maria Mosora. In neighboring Moldova, Macedonski influenced the Neosymbolism of Aureliu Busuioc. A magazine by the name of \"Literatorul\", which claims to represent the legacy of Macedonski's publication, was founded in Romania in 1991, being edited by writers Sorescu, Fănuș Neagu and Mircea Micu. In 2006, the Romanian Academy granted posthumous membership to Alexandru Macedonski.\n\nMacedonski's poems had a sizable impact on Romania's popular culture. During communism, \"Noaptea de mai\" was the basis for a successful musical adaptation, composed by Marian Nistor and sung by Mirabela Dauer. Tudor Gheorghe, a singer-songwriter inspired by American folk revival, also used some of Macedonski's texts as lyrics to his melodies. In the 2000s, the refrain of \"Noaptea de mai\" was mixed into a \"manea\" parody by Adrian Copilul Minune.\n\nAlthough his poetic theories were largely without echoes in Romanian art, Macedonski captured the interest of several modern artists, including, early on, cartoonist Nicolae Petrescu Găină. Alongside other writers who visited Terasa Oteteleșanu, Macedonski was notably portrayed the drawings of celebrated Romanian artist Iosif Iser. He is also depicted in a 1918 lithograph by Jean Alexandru Steriadi, purportedly Steriadi's only Symbolist work. \"Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu\" inspired a series of reliefs, designed by Alexis Macedonski and hosted in his father's house in Dorobanți. During the 1910s, busts of him were completed by two sculptors, Alexandru Severin and Friedrich Storck, one of Storck's variants being hosted by the Ioan Cantacuzino collection. In 1919, Theodor Burcă was also inspired to complete another bust, and, during World War II, was commissioned by Mayor of Bucharest Ion Rășcanu to build a Macedonski Monument in the Grădina Icoanei park, but this was never completed. Constantin Piliuță, a painter active in the second half of the 20th century, made Macedonski the subject of a portrait in series dedicated to Romanian cultural figures (also depicted were Nicolae Iorga, Ștefan Luchian and Vianu). In 1975, a bust of Macedonski, the work of Constantin Foamete, was unveiled in Craiova.\n\nOf Macedonski's numerous residences, the one in Dorobanți was demolished when the Academy of Economic Studies (ASE) was expanded. A commemorative plaque was later put up near the spot. Macedonski's childhood home in Goiești passed into state property under communism, and was in turn a school, a community home and a Macedonski Museum, before falling into neglect after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Several streets named in honor of Alexandru Macedonski, notably in Bucharest (by the ASE), Craiova, Cluj-Napoca and Timișoara.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21209825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21209825", "title": "Bit-hilani", "text": "Bit-hilani\n\nA Bit-hilani (Akkadian: \"Bīt-Ḫilāni\", meaning 'house of pillars') is an ancient architectural type of palace. It seems to have become popular at the end of the tenth and during the ninth century BCE during the early Iron Age in northern Syria although it may have originated as early as the Bronze Age. Contemporary records call it a Hittite-style palace, probably after the Neo-Hittite kingdoms of northern Syria.\n\nThe oldest excavated building described as \"Hilani\" by its excavator Sir Leonard Woolley is a palace in level IV at Alalakh dated to the 15th century BCE. The palace is thought to have been built by Niqmepa, a son of Idrimi of the royal family of the Amorite state of Yamhad based in Halab.\n\nA building at the citadel (Büyükkale) of the Hittite capital Hattusa may also have been of the hilani type. As most of the structures on the citadel underwent considerable rebuilding during the reign of Tudhaliya IV (ca. 1237 BCE–1209 BCE), it is usually dated to the 13th century BCE.\n\nKapara, king of the Hittite kingdom of Bit Bahiani in the 10th or 9th century BCE, built himself a palace of this style in his capital at Guzana (Tell Halaf). The palace, with a rich decoration of statues and relief orthostats, was excavated by Max von Oppenheim in 1911. Some of the finds were taken to Berlin, and most of them destroyed when von Oppenheim's private museum was hit during a bombing raid in November 1943. The National Museum of Aleppo has reconstructed the pillared portico in front of its entrance.\n\nOther buildings of this type have been excavated among others at Tell Tayinat, Qatna, Sam'al, Sakçagözü, Carchemish, Tell Seh Hamad, maybe Kinet Höyük and at Emar.\n\nWhen claiming to have built in the style of a hilani, most builders probably referred to the pillared portico with antechamber such as:\n\nSargon II, King of Assyria 722–705 BCE, at his new city of Dur-Sharrukin, begun in 713 BCE. An isolated building of which not much is known yet has been located in the western corner of the palace terrace. It may be a candidad for the building he mentions in his founding text.\n\"A portico, patterned after the Hittite palace, which in the language of Amurru they call a bit-hilani, I built in front of the palaces' gates.\"\nSennacherib, King of Assyria (704–681 BC), claims to have done some building in Niniveh in the style of a bit-hilani. Nothing similar to a \"hilani\" has to date been identified without doubt at his palace, known today as the South-West Palace in Niniveh, finished in 694 BCE. The building in question may not have been found yet.\n\nThe major feature for a visitor would have been the monumental entrance loggia or portico with columns flanked by large massive parts of the building and approached by a broad but relative low flight of steps. On one side a stairway to the upper parts would reside in one of these block like structures. Straight ahead one would enter the great hall, where one would have to turn by 90° to see the throne in the far end of the hall. The overall plan of the building would be rectangular with the large hall in the middle surrounded on all sides by the other much narrower rooms. \n\nThis type of design with a large central space surrounded by a double wall with smaller rooms taking up the space within the walls may be based on designs first used in the late Ubaid period in southern Mesopotamia such as the Ubaid house. Pillared porticos as gates or grand entrances were used by several cultures of the Bronze Age around the eastern Mediterranean sea. The examples of the Hittites and the Myceneans may be the best known. Through the megarons and propylaea of the mycenaean palaces the style may have lived into classical Greek designs. The late \"hilani\" of the levant may well be the combination of the old broad room concept with a Hittite-style portico. In recent traditional architecture it may have a late resemblance in the design of the liwan house.\n"}

{"id": "48462950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48462950", "title": "Color-blocking", "text": "Color-blocking\n\nColor-blocking is thought of as the exploration of taking colors that are opposites on the color wheel and pairing them together to make interesting and complementary color combinations. It is commonly associated in fashion as a trend that originated from the artwork of Dutch painter, Piet Mondrian. However, other experts argue whether his artwork is the true origin of color-blocking.\n\nIt’s widely believed by most historians that Piet Mondrian, a turn of the century artist, whose paintings were a collection of stark lines and flat squares, inspired this current color-blocking trend. Mondrian valued simplicity and therefore experimented with how far he could simplify his work, maximizing simplicity while still maintaining recognizable, although abstract, geometric shapes. Mondrian later named this style of painting Neo-Plasticism. In Piet Mondrian's Neoplasticism movement, his art directly inspired the fashion world, as well as home décor and baked goods. Although Mondrian is said to be the key figure of the modern art movement, there are others that believe the credit for this trend lies with Georges Seurat and Claude Monet. However sources report that it is Piet Mondrian who inspired other designers such as Yves Saint Laurent to create the famous Mondrian Dresses. Before Mondrian's aesthetic overtook the fashion world, pop art's materialization in the 50s opened America's eyes to a more vibrant but structured world. Pop Art incorporated the same clean lines and solid colors that Piet Mondrian's work encompassed. Proponents of the Georges Seurat and Monet origin theory claim that this novel acceptance lead to the color-blocking revolution. Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism aesthetic evolved through the decades, coming to include aspects such as synthetic color and a strong imposed structure in the 1960s. The color-blocking trend took off in the 60s as fashion designers like Yves Saint Laurent adopted this revolutionary aesthetic. It wasn't long before this new trend was reaching as far as London; the youth of London began wearing ensembles that would come to be known as mod fashion. Mod fashion much resembled the artistic style of Piet Mondrian; mismatched, solid color separates that were composed of blocks in different hues.\n\nAs for today color-blocking is more frequently seen in the home as a latest thing in interior design. Although some argue that color-blocking is a thing in the past, high fashion figures and enthusiasts believe that this retro trend continues to thrive as a result of the hipster generation, whom revive the trend and turn it into something seen as fashion-forward.\n\nIn the fashion world, the process of color-blocking refers to wearing blocks of colors. Color-blocking is different than how people usually dress because the colors in the outfit are considered louder, or colors that clash. Fashion figures explain color-blocking as wearing multiple articles of solid-colored clothing in a single outfit. Traditional color-blocking consists of putting together two or three different, but complementary colors together in one outfit. It is also considered color-blocking even if the colors are not direct opposites on the color wheel. For example, yellow and orange are right next to each other, but adding purple (a color on the opposite of the wheel) creates a color-blocked outfit.\n\nFashion icons, designers, and figures have developed rules that go along with the art of color-blocking. Basic rules for color-blocking are centered on the colour theory. The colour theory states that there are unwritten rules in color-blocking such as not wearing too many colors together at once, and balancing an outfit with a neutral such as grey.\n\nSince color-blocking is an abstract form of art, it is easy to create illusions for accentuating body shapes, making people look taller and thinner. Color-blocking provides versatility to clothing that other trends and styles don't provide.\n\nColor-blocking has recently spilled over into home décor and interior design. This trend takes the same idea in home design that is does in fashion: the colors are paired with no concern of matching. In the home color-blocking is used mainly in room décor and walls. Décor clashing with each other, or in more mild cases the opposite colors complement each other to provide an interesting and refreshing atmosphere in a room.\n\n"}
{"id": "4940990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4940990", "title": "DV8 Physical Theatre", "text": "DV8 Physical Theatre\n\nDV8 Physical Theatre (or Dance Visual 8) is a physically integrated dance company based at Artsadmin in London, United Kingdom. It was officially founded in 1986 by Lloyd Newson (1986-2015), Michelle Richecoeur (1986-1988) and Nigel Charnock (1986-1989, 1992). Lloyd Newson has led the company as choreographer and artistic director since its inception, apart from the production \"My Sex, Our Dance\" (1986), which was co-created and performed with Nigel Charnock.\n\nDV8's work is characterised by the desire to communicate ideas and feelings clearly and very pretentiously, often with a focus on socio-political issues. The work challenges the limitations of dance by using any means necessary to find the most appropriate way to say something, thereby incorporating elements of theatre, dance, film, and, increasingly, text. DV8 has toured work in the UK and to 28 countries worldwide, and received 55 national and international awards.\n\nLloyd Newson founded DV8 Physical Theatre in 1986 in response to his frustration with the lack of subject matter in contemporary dance. He felt audiences were being ‘conned about the depth’ of (much) contemporary dance, which he saw as generally superficial; obsessed with 'aesthetics over content'. The first work Newson produced with the new company was made in partnership with Nigel Charnock, and was titled \"My Sex, Our Dance\" (1986); it tackled the emergence of AIDS and investigated the idea of trust, both emotionally and physically, between two gay men. This was followed by \"Deep End\" (1987), in which dancer Liz Ranken joined Newson, Richecoeur and Charnock as a performer, and \"Elemen T(H)ree Sex\" (1987): works which focused on heterosexual relationships. All three works toured the UK, and \"My Sex, Our Dance\" and \"Deep End\" were also performed in New York as part of the Next Wave Festival (held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) in 1988.\n\nThe next work for the company was \"My Body, Your Body\" (1987), which explored the psychology of women who seek out relationships with abusive men. It was based on an audio recording of a close female friend of Newson’s and the book, Women Who Love Too Much by Robin Norwood. The production toured the UK in 1987 and featured Wendy Houstoun, who later played the lead role in \"If Only…\" (1990) and \"Strange Fish\" (1992).\n\nIn 1988, Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men was created for the stage and, two years later, adapted for film – the first of several made by the company. The production drew inspiration from the book, Killing for Company, about serial killer Dennis Nielsen. It garnered numerous awards for DV8, including the Time Out Dance Award and the Evening Standard Ballet Award, both in 1989. In 1990, film-director David Hinton, commissioned by the South Bank Show (ITV), collaborated with Newson to adapt the stage production for television.\n\nAfter Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men, Newson began to develop a more poetic style, involving increasingly complex sets. He stated at the time that he was ‘fatigued by the bruising physicality’ that marked DV8’s work from 1986-1989. The first of these works was \"If Only…\" (1990), which won the Golden Pegasus Award at the Melbourne International Festival (1990). \"Strange Fish\" (1992) followed, featuring Wendy Houstoun alongside Nigel Charnock and singer Melanie Pappenheim. Again, it was a critical success: the stage production won the London Dance & Performance Award (1992) and was adapted for a BBC film the same year, later winning the company’s first Prix Italia.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, DV8 continued to produce work that was critically well received and popular with audiences. The BBC film version of Enter Achilles (1995) won a Prix Italia and an International Emmy Award in 1997, while \"The Happiest Day of My Life\" (1999) won the Time Out Set Design of the Year.\n\nIn 2000, the Sydney Cultural Olympiad commissioned \"Can We Afford This\", later renamed \"The Cost of Living\". It went on to open London’s Dance Umbrella season, and toured to Hong Kong. In 2004, the work was adapted into an award winning film, directed by Newson, and reworked with extra scenes as a site-specific production, \"Living Costs\" (2003), commissioned by and for London’s Tate Modern contemporary art gallery.\n\nIn 2004-5, DV8 created \"Just for Show\", the first of a series of co-productions with the National Theatre (London). This was a significant new relationship in terms of the company’s cross-genre position between increasingly arbitrary categories of “dance” and “theatre”.\n\nThe next production, \"To Be Straight With You\" (2007), marked a move by Newson into verbatim theatre – setting minutely-detailed movement to the real (edited) words of real people. To create the script, 85 people of varying ethnicities and sexuality were interviewed by Newson and his researcher, Anshu Rastogi, about their experiences and views concerning religion, culture and homosexuality.\n\n\"Can We Talk About This?\" (2011–12), a second verbatim production, dealt with freedom of speech, censorship and Islam. It drew on existing interviews as well as those conducted by Newson himself, and involved people associated with the burning of author Salman Rushdie’s Satanic Verses and associates of film-maker Theo van Gogh, who was murdered by Dutch Islamist, Mohammed Bouyeri. \"Can We Talk About This?\" won a Helpmann Award (Australia, 2012), and was named Tanz Magazine’s Production of the Year (Germany, 2012).\n\nDV8’s most recent work, \"JOHN\" (2014) follows the life-story of a man, the eponymous title character, played by Hannes Langolf. It traces his criminality, drug use, personal relationships, efforts at rehabilitation and desire to lead an ordinary life. Again co-produced with the National Theatre, it was broadcast to cinemas worldwide through the NT Live programme.\n\nOn the 12th January 2016, the company announced that artistic director Lloyd Newson was taking time out to reflect about the future. Due to this the company confirmed that the production of new work was to be paused indefinitely. \n\nDV8’s work is characterised by a desire to take risks, to question people’s attitudes and beliefs, to dissolve barriers that separate art forms, and ultimately to communicate ideas and feelings clearly and unpretentiously. The company frequently addresses pertinent social topics, such as freedom of speech, human rights, multiculturalism, tolerance/intolerance, gender roles, sexual identity and social class, as well as personal issues.\nDV8’s work seeks to use the most appropriate means available to serve its mission. Thus, its productions have incorporated elements of dance, naturalistic movement, video, circus skills and more recently, verbatim text.\n\nDV8 Physical Theatre receives funding through Arts Council England’s National Portfolio programme, as well as occasional project support from the British Council. It has toured work extensively in the UK and Europe, and further afield to Australia, the USA, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan. Many of its long-term co-production partners are theatres and festivals from across the world. It is an Artsadmin associate company, and also a member of the ITC, Dance UK and IETM. Newson has often stated that the company is motivated by artistic inspiration and creative need, rather than financial, organisational and touring demands.\n\nIt has thus far produced 18 works for the stage, the majority of which have toured internationally, and four award-winning films adapted from stage performances.\n\n\nFilm adaptations of DV8's theatrical productions, except Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men, were produced by DV8 Films Ltd.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2922874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2922874", "title": "Ethics (Spinoza)", "text": "Ethics (Spinoza)\n\nEthics, Demonstrated in Geometrical Order (), usually known as the Ethics, is a philosophical treatise written in Latin by Benedict de Spinoza. It was written between 1664 and 1665 and was first published posthumously in 1677.\n\nThe book is perhaps the most ambitious attempt to apply the method of Euclid in philosophy. Spinoza puts forward a small number of definitions and axioms from which he attempts to derive hundreds of propositions and corollaries, such as \"When the Mind imagines its own lack of power, it is saddened by it\", \"A free man thinks of nothing less than of death\", and \"The human Mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the Body, but something of it remains which is eternal.\"\n\nThe first part of the book addresses the relationship between God and the universe. Tradition held that God exists outside of the universe, created it for a reason, and could have created a different universe if he chose. Spinoza denies each point. According to Spinoza, God \"is\" the natural world. As with many of Spinoza's claims, what this means is a matter of dispute. Spinoza claims that the things that make up the universe, including human beings, are God's \"modes\". This means that everything is, in some sense, dependent upon God. The nature of this dependence is disputed. Some scholars say that the modes are properties of God in the traditional sense. Others say that modes are effects of God. Either way, the modes are also logically dependent on God's essence, in this sense: everything that happens follows from the nature of God, just like how it follows from the nature of a triangle that its angles are equal to two right angles. Since God had to exist with the nature he has, nothing that has happened could have been avoided, and if God has fixed a particular fate for a particular mode, there is no escaping it. As Spinoza puts it, \"A thing which has been determined by God to produce an effect cannot render itself undetermined.\" God's creation of the universe is not a decision, much less one motivated by a purpose.\n\nThe second part focuses on the human mind and body. Spinoza attacks several Cartesian positions: (1) that the mind and body are distinct substances that can affect one another; (2) that we know our minds better than we know our bodies; (3) that our senses may be trusted; (4) that despite being created by God we can make mistakes, namely, when we affirm, of our own free will, an idea that is not clear and distinct. Spinoza denies each of Descartes's points. Regarding (1), Spinoza argues that the mind and the body are a single thing that is being thought of in two different ways. The whole of nature can be fully described in terms of thoughts or in terms of bodies. However, we cannot mix these two ways of describing things, as Descartes does, and say that the mind affects the body or vice versa. Moreover, the mind's self-knowledge is not fundamental: it cannot know its own thoughts better than it knows the ways in which its body is acted upon by other bodies.\n\nFurther, there is no difference between contemplating an idea and thinking that it is true, and there is no freedom of the will at all. Sensory perception, which Spinoza calls \"knowledge of the first kind\", is entirely inaccurate, since it reflects how our own bodies work more than how things really are. We can also have a kind of accurate knowledge called \"knowledge of the second kind\", or \"reason\". This encompasses knowledge of the features common to all things, and includes principles of physics and geometry. We can also have \"knowledge of the third kind\", or \"intuitive knowledge\". This is a sort of knowledge that, somehow, relates particular things to the nature of God.\n\nIn the third part of the \"Ethics\", Spinoza argues that all things, including human beings, strive to persevere in their being. This is usually taken to mean that things try to last for as long as they can. Spinoza explains how this striving (\"conatus\") underlies our emotions (love, hate, joy, sadness and so on). Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain cases passive. In so far as it has adequate ideas it is necessarily active, and in so far as it has inadequate ideas, it is necessarily passive.\n\nThe fourth part analyzes human passions, which Spinoza sees as aspects of the mind that direct us outwards to seek what gives pleasure and shun what gives pain. The \"bondage\" he refers to is domination by these passions or \"affects\" as he calls them. Spinoza considers how the affects, ungoverned, can torment people and make it impossible for mankind to live in harmony with one another.\n\nThe fifth part argues that reason can govern the affects in the pursuit of virtue, which for Spinoza is self-preservation: only with the aid of reason can humans distinguish the passions that truly aid virtue from those that are ultimately harmful. By reason, we can see things as they truly are, \"sub specie aeternitatis\", \"under the aspect of eternity,\" and because Spinoza treats God and nature as indistinguishable, by knowing things as they are we improve our knowledge of God. Seeing that all things are determined by nature to be as they are, we can achieve the rational tranquility that best promotes our happiness, and liberate ourselves from being driven by our passions.\n\nAccording to Spinoza, God is Nature and Nature is God. This is his pantheism. In his previous book, \"Theologico-Political Treatise\", Spinoza discussed the inconsistencies that result when God is assumed to have human characteristics. In the third chapter of that book, he stated that the word \"God\" means the same as the word \"Nature\". He wrote: \"Whether we say ... that all things happen according to the laws of nature, or are ordered by the decree and direction of God, we say the same thing.\" He later qualified this statement in his letter to Oldenburg by abjuring materialism. Nature, to Spinoza, is a metaphysical substance, not physical matter. In this posthumously published book \"Ethics\", he equated God with nature by writing “God or Nature” four times. “...For Spinoza, God or Nature—being one and the same thing— is the whole, infinite, eternal, necessarily existing, active system of the universe within which absolutely everything exists. This is the fundamental principle of the \"Ethics\"...”\n\nSpinoza holds that everything that exists is part of nature, and everything in nature follows the same basic laws. In this perspective, human beings are part of nature, and hence they can be explained and understood in the same way as everything else in nature. This aspect of Spinoza’s philosophy — his naturalism — was radical for its time, and perhaps even for today. In the preface to Part III of \"Ethics\" (relating to emotions), he writes:\n\nTherefore, Spinoza affirms that the passions of hatred, anger, envy, and so on, considered in themselves, “follow from this same necessity and efficacy of nature; they answer to certain definite causes, through which they are understood, and possess certain properties as worthy of being known as the properties of anything else”. Humans are not different in kind from the rest of the natural world; they are part of it.\n\nSpinoza’s naturalism can be seen as deriving from his firm commitment to the principle of sufficient reason (), which is the thesis that everything has an explanation. He articulates the in a strong fashion, as he applies it not only to everything that is, but also to everything that is not:\n\nAnd to continue with Spinoza's triangle example, here is one claim he makes about God:\n\nSpinoza rejected the idea of an external Creator suddenly, and apparently capriciously, creating the world at one particular time rather than another, and creating it out of nothing. The solution appeared to him more perplexing than the problem, and rather unscientific in spirit as involving a break in continuity. He preferred to think of the entire system of reality as its own ground. This view was simpler; it avoided the impossible conception of creation out of nothing; and it was religiously more satisfying by bringing God and man into closer relationship. Instead of Nature, on the one hand, and a supernatural God, on the other, he posited one world of reality, at once Nature and God, and leaving no room for the supernatural. This so-called naturalism of Spinoza is only distorted if one starts with a crude materialistic idea of Nature and supposes that Spinoza degraded God. The truth is that he raised Nature to the rank of God by conceiving Nature as the fulness of reality, as the One and All. He rejected the specious simplicity obtainable by denying the reality of Matter, or of Mind, or of God. The cosmic system comprehends them all. In fact, God and Nature become identical when each is conceived as the Perfect Self-Existent. This constitutes Spinoza's \"Pantheism\".\n\nAccording to Spinoza, God has \"attributes\". One attribute is 'extension', another attribute is 'thought', and there are infinitely many such attributes. Since Spinoza holds that to exist is to \"act\", some readers take 'extension' to refer to an activity characteristic of bodies (for example, the active process of taking up space, exercising physical power, or resisting a change of place or shape). They take 'thought' to refer to the activity that is characteristic of minds, namely thinking, the exercise of mental power. Each attribute has modes. All bodies are modes of extension, and all ideas are modes of thought.\n\nSpinoza's ideas relating to the character and structure of reality are expressed by him in terms of \"substance\", \"attributes\", and \"modes\". These terms are very old and familiar, but not in the sense in which Spinoza employs them. To understand Spinoza, it is necessary to lay aside all preconceptions about them, and follow Spinoza closely. Spinoza found it impossible to understand the finite, dependent, transient objects and events of experience without assuming some reality not dependent on anything else but self-existent, not produced by anything else but eternal, not restricted or limited by anything else but infinite. Such an uncaused, self-sustaining reality he called \"substance\". So, for instance, he could not understand the reality of material objects and physical events without assuming the reality of a self-existing, infinite and eternal physical force which expresses itself in all the movements and changes which occur, as we say, in space.\n\nThis physical force he called \"extension\", and described it, at first, as a \"substance\", in the sense just explained. Similarly, he could not understand the various dependent, transient mental experiences with which we are familiar without assuming the reality of a self-existing, infinite and eternal consciousness, mental force, or mind-energy, which expresses itself in all these finite experiences of perceiving and understanding, of feeling and striving. This consciousness or mind-energy he called \"thought\", and described it also, at first, as a \"substance\". Each of these \"substances\" he regarded as infinite of its kind (that is, as exhaustive of all the events of its own kind), and as irreducible to the other, or any other, substance. But in view of the intimate way in which Extension and Thought express themselves conjointly in the life of man, Spinoza considered it necessary to conceive of Extension and Thought not as detached realities, but as constituting one organic whole or system. And in order to express this idea, he then described Extension and Thought as \"attributes\", reserving the term \"Substance\" for the system which they constitute between them. This change of description was not intended to deny that Extension and Thought are substances in the sense of being self-existent, etc. It was only intended to express their coherence in one system. The system of course would be more than any one attribute. For each attribute is only \"infinite of its kind\"; the system of all attributes is \"absolutely infinite\", that is, exhausts the whole of reality. Spinoza, accordingly, now restricted the term \"substance\" to the complete system, though he occasionally continued to use the phrase \"substance or attribute\", or described Extension as a substance.\n\nAs commonly used, especially since the time of Locke, the term substance is contrasted with its attributes or qualities as their substratum or bearer. But this meaning must not be read into Spinoza. For Spinoza, Substance is not the support or bearer of the Attributes, but the system of Attributes — he actually uses the expression \"Substance or the Attributes.\" If there is any difference at all between \"Substance\" and \"the Attributes\", as Spinoza uses these terms, it is only the difference between the Attributes conceived as an organic system and the Attributes conceived (but not by Spinoza) as a mere sum of detached forces. Something is still necessary to complete the account of Spinoza's conception of Substance. So far only the two Attributes have been considered, namely, Extension and Thought. Spinoza, however, realised that there may be other Attributes, unknown to man. If so, they are part of the one Substance or cosmic system. And using the term \"infinite\" in the sense of \"complete\" or \"exhaustive\", he ascribed to Substance an infinity of Attributes, that is, all the attributes there are, whether known to man or not.\n\nNow reality, for Spinoza, is activity. Substance is incessantly active, each Attribute exercising its kind of energy in all possible ways. Thus the various objects and events of the material world come into being as \"modes\" (modifications or states) of the attribute Extension; and the various minds and mental experiences come into being as modes of the attribute Thought (or Consciousness). These modes are not external creations of the Attributes, but immanent results — they are not \"thrown off\" by the Attributes, but are states (or modifications) of them, as air-waves are states of the air. Each Attribute, however, expresses itself in its finite modes not immediately (or directly) but mediately (or indirectly), at least in the sense to be explained now. Galilean physics tended to regard the whole world of physical phenomena as the result of differences of motion or momentum. And, though erroneously conceived, the Cartesian conception of a constant quantity of motion in the world led Spinoza to conceive of all physical phenomena as so many varying expressions of that store of motion (or motion and rest).\n\nSpinoza might, of course, have identified Extension with energy of motion. But, with his usual caution, he appears to have suspected that motion may be only one of several types of physical energy. So he described motion simply as a mode of Extension, but as an \"infinite\" mode (because complete or exhaustive of all finite modes of motion) and as an \"immediate\" mode (as a direct expression of Extension). Again, the physical world (or \"the face of the world as a whole\", as Spinoza calls it) retains a certain sameness in spite of the innumerable changes in detail that are going on. Accordingly, Spinoza described also the physical world as a whole as an \"infinite\" mode of extension (\"infinite\" because exhaustive of all facts and events that can be reduced to motion), but as a \"mediate\" (or indirect) mode, because he regarded it as the outcome of the conservation of motion (itself a mode, though an \"immediate\" mode). The physical things and events of ordinary experience are \"finite\" modes. In essence each of them is part of the Attribute Extension, which is active in each of them. But the finiteness of each of them is due to the fact that it is restrained or hedged in, so to say, by other finite modes. This limitation or determination is negation in the sense that each finite mode is \"not\" the whole attribute Extension; it is not the other finite modes. But each mode is positively real and ultimate as part of the Attribute.\n\nIn the same kind of way the Attribute Thought exercises its activity in various mental processes, and in such systems of mental process as are called minds or souls. But in this case, as in the case of Extension, Spinoza conceives of the finite modes of Thought as mediated by infinite modes. The immediate infinite mode of Thought he describes as \"the idea of God\"; the mediate infinite mode he calls \"the infinite idea\" or \"the idea of all things\". The other Attributes (if any) must be conceived in an analogous manner. And the whole Universe or Substance is conceived as one dynamic system of which the various Attributes are the several world-lines along which it expresses itself in all the infinite variety of events.\n\nGiven the persistent misinterpretation of Spinozism it is worth emphasizing the dynamic character of reality as Spinoza conceived it. The cosmic system is certainly a logical or rational system, according to Spinoza, for Thought is a constitutive part of it; but it is not \"merely\" a logical system — it is dynamic as well as logical. His frequent use of geometrical illustrations affords no evidence at all in support of a purely logico-mathematical interpretation of his philosophy; for Spinoza regarded geometrical figures, not in a Platonic or static manner, but as things traced out by moving particles or lines, etc., that is, dynamically.\n\nFor Spinoza, reality means activity, and the reality of anything expresses itself in a tendency to self-preservation — to exist is to persist. In the lowest kinds of things, in so-called inanimate matter, this tendency shows itself as a \"will to live\". Regarded physiologically the effort is called \"appetite\"; when we are conscious of it, it is called \"desire\". The moral categories, good and evil, are intimately connected with desire, though not in the way commonly supposed. Man does not desire a thing because he thinks it is good, or shun it because he considers it bad; rather he considers anything good if he desires it, and regards it as bad if he has an aversion for it. Now whatever is felt to heighten vital activity gives pleasure; whatever is felt to lower such activity causes pain. Pleasure coupled with a consciousness of its external cause is called love, and pain coupled with a consciousness of its external cause is called hate — \"love\" and \"hate\" being used in the wide sense of \"like\" and \"dislike\". All human feelings are derived from pleasure, pain and desire. Their great variety is due to the differences in the kinds of external objects which give rise to them, and to the differences in the inner conditions of the individual experiencing them.\n\nSpinoza gives a detailed analysis of the whole gamut of human feelings, and his account is one of the classics of psychology. For the present purpose the most important distinction is that between \"active\" feelings and \"passive\" feelings (or \"passions\"). Man, according to Spinoza, is active or free in so far as any experience is the outcome solely of his own nature; he is passive, or a bondsman, in so far as any experience is due to other causes besides his own nature. The active feelings are all of them forms of self-realisation, of heightened activity, of strength of mind, and are therefore always pleasurable. It is the passive feelings (or \"passions\") which are responsible for all the ills of life, for they are induced largely by things outside us and frequently cause that lowered vitality which means pain. Spinoza next links up his ethics with his theory of knowledge, and correlates the moral progress of man with his intellectual progress. At the lowest stage of knowledge, that of \"opinion\", man is under the dominant influence of things outside himself, and so is in the bondage of the passions. At the next stage, the stage of \"reason\", the characteristic feature of the human mind, its intelligence, asserts itself, and helps to emancipate him from his bondage to the senses and external allurements. The insight gained into the nature of the passions helps to free man from their domination. A better understanding of his own place in the cosmic system and of the place of all the objects of his likes and dislikes, and his insight into the necessity which rules all things, tend to cure him of his resentments, regrets and disappointments. He grows reconciled to things, and wins peace of mind. In this way reason teaches acquiescence in the universal order, and elevates the mind above the turmoil of passion. At the highest stage of knowledge, that of \"intuitive knowledge\", the mind apprehends all things as expressions of the eternal cosmos. It sees all things in God, and God in all things. It feels itself as part of the eternal order, identifying its thoughts with cosmic thought and its interests with cosmic interests. Thereby it becomes eternal as one of the eternal ideas in which the Attribute Thought expresses itself, and attains to that \"blessedness\" which \"is not the reward of virtue, but virtue itself\", that is, the perfect joy which characterises perfect self-activity. This is not an easy or a common achievement. \"But\", says Spinoza, \"everything excellent is as difficult as it is rare.\"\n\nShortly after his death in 1677, Spinoza's works were placed on the Catholic Church's Index of Banned Books. Condemnations soon appeared, such as Aubert de Versé's \"L'impie convaincu\" (1685). According to its subtitle, in this work \"the foundations of [Spinoza's] atheism are refuted\".\n\nFor the next hundred years, if European philosophers read this so-called heretic, they did so almost entirely in secret. How much forbidden Spinozism they were sneaking into their diets remains a subject of continual intrigue. Locke, Hume, Leibniz and Kant all stand accused by later scholars of indulging in periods of closeted Spinozism. At the close of the 18th century, a controversy centering on the \"Ethics\" scandalized the German philosophy scene.\n\nThe first known translation of the \"Ethics\" into English was completed in 1856 by the novelist George Eliot, though not published until much later. The book next appeared in English in 1883, by the hand of the novelist Hale White. Spinoza rose clearly into view for anglophone metaphysicians in the late nineteenth century, during the British craze for Hegel. In his admiration for Spinoza, Hegel was joined in this period by his countrymen Schelling, Goethe, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. In the twentieth century, the ghost of Spinoza continued to show itself, for example in the writings of Russell, Wittgenstein, Davidson, and Deleuze. Among writers of fiction and poetry, the students of Spinoza include Coleridge, George Eliot, Melville, Borges, and Malamud.\n\nThe first published Dutch translations were by the poet Herman Gorter (1895) and by Willem Meyer (1896) .\n\nSchopenhauer claimed that Spinoza misused words. “Thus he calls ‘God’ that which is everywhere called ‘the world’; ‘justice’ that which is everywhere called ‘power’; and ‘will’ that which is everywhere called ‘judgement’.” Also, “that concept of \"substance\"...with the definition of which Spinoza accordingly begins...appears on close and honest investigation to be a higher yet unjustified abstraction of the concept \"matter\".” In spite of his repeated objections and critical remarks, Schopenhauer incorporated some of Spinoza's fundamental concepts into his system, especially concerning the theory of emotions; there was also a striking similarity between Schopenhauer's will and Spinoza's substance.\n\nIn fact, within the German philosophical sphere, Spinoza’s influence on German Idealism was remarkable. He was both a challenge and inspiration for the three major figures of this movement: Hegel, Schelling and Fichte — who all sought to define their own philosophical positions in relation to his. Schopenhauer, who detested these three philosophers to varying degrees of intensity, also had a similarly ambivalent relation to the Dutch philosopher. How Spinoza came to influence Schopenhauer is not clear, but one might speculate: it could have come from his exposure to Fichte’s lectures, from his conversations with Goethe or simply from being caught up in the post-Kantian attempt to rethink the Critical Philosophy. Still, his engagement with Spinozism is evident throughout his writings and attentive readers of his chief work may indeed note his ambivalence toward Spinoza’s philosophy. He sees in Spinoza an ally against the feverish culture of the West. For example, in the context of a rather favourable account of \"the standpoint of affirmation\" he notes that “[T]he philosophy of Bruno and that of Spinoza might also bring to this standpoint the person whose conviction was not shaken or weakened by their errors and imperfections”. Moreover, in discussing Spinoza and Giordano Bruno, Schopenhauer also affirms that:\n\nGiven Schopenhauer’s respect for Hindu philosophy, comments like these indicate that he too felt intellectual kinship with Spinoza. Elsewhere, Schopenhauer points to more fundamental affinities, but he also criticizes Spinoza. These criticisms deal with fundamental disagreements about the ultimate nature of reality and whether it is to be affirmed or denied.\n\n\n"}

Her admirer, Kasumi Nohara, kisses her photo at midnight and suddenly disappears with her friend Michi as a witness. Her disappearance is quickly attributed to a supposed curse that affects girls who kiss the photo of the person they admire at midnight. Aya's photo is taken to the attic by Sakuya Itsuki and Risa for safekeeping, but the two alongside three other girls are enticed to kiss the photo. Except for Risa, who is later found dazed but alive, all of them are eventually found dead at a nearby river.\n\nWhen Michi attempts to kiss the photo, Aya stops her and reveals that she is not responsible for the curse, as the photo is not hers. They search help in Kazumi \"Mary\" Kusanagi, an eccentric photographer, who keeps photos inside her studio of lesbian girls who made suicide pact by drowning themselves at a lake, which is now closed down, due to the then society's intolerance towards same-sex couples. She also tells a story about a couple who was doomed when one of them refused to commit suicide, causing her to be haunted by her lover for the rest of her life. Aya then admits to Michi that she is haunted by the guilt of letting a fellow orphan of hers die in front of her. \n\nMichi decides to kiss the photo to put herself into the curse and chains herself to Aya so the latter can save her should she be in danger. However, the two are separated halfway through and Aya is knocked out by Takashi, the mentally handicapped brother of the school nun, Mayumi Aso. She is thrown into a reservoir located at the place where the lesbian couples committed their suicides. There, Aya remembers that the doppelganger is in fact her twin sister, Maya. Though she died at an early age, Maya \"grew up\" alongside Aya and put a curse at the photo until Aya could find her in the reservoir. Meanwhile, Michi is about to be drowned by Mayumi, who is revealed to be the one murdering the girls so as to keep Takashi's supposed involvement in Maya's death a secret, but she chooses to drown herself with Takashi when the authorities are closing in. Michi goes to the reservoir and reunites with Aya.\n\nAya and Michi participate in the school choir celebrating their graduation. Meanwhile, Mary visits the school's headmistress and abbess, correctly deducing her as the lesbian girl who was haunted by the spirit of her lover. The headmistress reveals that to keep her lover from bothering her, she murdered Maya so the latter could accompany her, though she is distressed when the act led to more murders by Mayumi, although her brother had nothing to do with it.

He commented that the best aspect of the movie is the way in which it is told. Rather than focusing solely on Michi, the movie constantly shown the story through many viewpoints other than her own, which intertwining with each other and slowly expose the truth behind the mystery in the film. He found it interesting that a large portion of the story revolves around being a lesbian in Japan not only during the modern era, but also at Meiji era. He also noted that the movie's \"intensely creepy and atmospheric\" tone are what builds the fear, a feat many horror films could not hope to accomplish. However, he has a mixed review for the lack of ghost killing via camera in the film, which is supposed to be one of pivotal elements in the game franchise. Nevertheless, he noted that the movie is a film very much worthy of the Fatal Frame name, and stated that \"if you are a fan of Fatal Frame or Japanese horror in general, this is most certainly a film to watch.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21048863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21048863", "title": "Henry Fielding's early plays", "text": "Henry Fielding's early plays\n\nThe early plays of Henry Fielding mark the beginning of Fielding's literary career. His early plays span the time period from his first production in 1728 to the beginning of the Actor's Rebellion of 1733, a strife within the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane that divided the theatrical community and threatened to disrupt London stage performances. These plays introduce Fielding's take on politics, gender, and morality and serve as an early basis for how Fielding develops his ideas on these matters throughout his career.\n\nFielding first produced a play in February 1728. Although his first production, \"Love in Several Masques\", lasted only a few nights, it was the start of his career in theatre. On 16 March 1728, Fielding enrolled at the University of Leyden, but he did not abandon the theatre. His early plays were those of an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London to earn a living. Arthur Murphy, in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned to London and treated the theatre as a career because his father stopped an allowance of 200 pounds a year.\n\nHowever, there is little evidence that Fielding lacked funds, or that such a lack of funds would cause him to leave Leyden to return to writing plays; Fielding eventually returned to Leyden on 22 February 1729. It is not known when or why Fielding left the school, but he produced \"The Temple Beau\" on 26 January 1730, which suggests that he returned to London by November 1729. By the time of his return, he had three plays, either still in draft form or complete: \"Don Quixote in England\", \"The Wedding-Day\" and \"The Temple Beau\". Of these, only \"The Temple Beau\" was accepted for the stage.\n\nWhen Fielding returned to working with the Royal Theatre, his piece \"The Lottery\" became an immediate success and lasted for decades after. Combined with \"The Modern Husband\", Fielding could have received up to 1,000 pounds from the plays' first run. This placed Fielding at the position of being the main contributor of plays to the Royal Theatre. Currently, Fielding is primarily viewed as a novelist, but his plays suggest that he wished to be a playwright and that his career would be in theatre. Although Fielding wrote twenty-six plays, only a handful of them were ever published in critical editions before 1990.\n\nThe early plays include \"Love in Several Masques\", \"The Temple Beau\", \"The Author's Farce\", \"Tom Thumb\", \"Rape upon Rape\", \"The Tragedy of Tragedies\", \"The Letter Writers\", \"The Welsh Opera\", \"The Grub-Street Opera\", \"The Lottery\", \"The Modern Husband\", \"The Old Debauchees\", \"The Covent-Garden Tragedy\", and \"The Mock Doctor\". These plays start in 1727, when Fielding first worked on \"Love in Several Masques\", until the disruption of the winter 1732–1733 theatre season at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. This disruption, caused by illness, management problems, and other incidents, started the Actor Rebellion of 1733.\n\n\"Love in Several Masques\" was Fielding's first play, and was first released on 16 February 1728. Though the play was never revived and only ran for four nights, it still did moderately well especially when compared with the competing plays at that time. In the play, three respectable males each meet a female counterpart three times, and share a parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. Fielding focuses on men and how he believes they should prove their worth before marriage. It also highlights Fielding's belief in the relationship of morality and libertine beliefs and introduces character types that Fielding would use throughout his plays and novels.\n\n\"Don Quixote in England\" was started as Fielding's second play, but it was not finished and produced until the later part of his career. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of \"Don Quixote in England\". It was refused by the Theatre Royal and it was not produced or printed until 1734. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's 1734 preface. It was his second play, and Fielding attributes it to being written at Leyden during 1728. It was intended more as amusement than as a serious production and was an imitation of Cervantes's \"Don Quixote\". After the prompting of Barton Booth and Colley Cibber, Fielding put away the play until 1733, when the Drury-Lane actors asked him for a new play. Soon after, Fielding rewrote parts of the play.\n\n\"The Wedding Day\" was started as his third play, but it was not finished until years later and finally brought out on both the stage and in print after his theatrical career ended. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of \"The Wedding-Day\". It was refused by John Rich to be staged, and it was not produced until 1743 by David Garrick. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's preface to the play in his \"Miscellanies\" (1743). In it, Fielding says that he intended the leads, Millamour and Charlotte, for Robert Wilks and Anne Oldfield. However, Oldfield died before the play could be produced, and Fielding and Wilks got into a fight, which made it impossible for Fielding to convince him to join the production.\n\nFielding started work on his fourth play, \"The Temple Beau\", in April 1729, but did not finish until the end of the year. Rejected by his first theatre, the play had to be performed at another one, where it had 13 shows its first year and few revivals thereafter. The play is about Wilding, a young law student who gives up his studies to seek pleasure, and his attempts to marry a woman for her money. Fielding focuses on hypocrisy and gender equality in marriage with characters' interaction with Wilding.\n\nFielding's fifth play, \"The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town\", first opened on 30 March 1730 at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and initially ran for 41 nights, which marked it as a major success. The play incorporates Fielding's response to Drury Lane and their previous rejection of his works. It also contains a third act, a puppet show, that pokes fun at theatre and the literary community as a whole. The play was revived many times in its original format and later in the medium of puppet show for its entire format. The plot focuses on Harry Luckless, an author, as he attempts to have a successful writing career, pursue women, dodge his landlady, and eventually put on a show within the show. To emphasise the literary satire, Fielding introduced his persona \"Scriblerus Secundus\" and adopts the tradition of the Scriblerus Club.\n\n\"Tom Thumb\", Fielding's sixth play, was added to the ninth showing of \"The Author's Farce\", 24 April 1730. Together, the shows lasted at the Haymarket until they were replaced by Fielding's next production, \"Rape upon Rape\". \"Tom Thumb\" was later included with other productions, including \"Rape upon Rape\", and later transformed into the \"Tragedy of Tragedies\". In the print edition, Fielding added footnotes, prefaces, and prologues, which introduced the narratorial style found in Fielding's later works. The plot deals with the English hero, Tom Thumb, who is of only tiny proportions. After defeating a group of giants, Tom Thumb is handsomely rewarded by King Arthur, which later erupts in a comical love triangle between Tom, Arthur's wife Queen Dollalolla, and Princess Huncamunca. Tom is eventually swallowed by a cow and killed. Soon after, his ghost appears but meets an untimely death. This scene reportedly provoked Jonathan Swift to laughter, a rare feat. The farcical nature of Tom Thumb pokes fun at 17th and 18th-century tragedy, gender roles and gender politics.\n\nFielding's seventh play, \"Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in His Own Trap\", was a five-act comedic play that first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights. The play enjoyed some success until it was renamed \"The Coffee-House Politician\" and was altered to possibly update the play as it focused on mocking current news events. The play is a love comedy that incorporates a corrupt judge that stands in the lovers' way. Eventually, various characters attempt to stop the judge, but he prevails albeit in a comedic fashion. Fielding's focus in the play is to point out corruption in government and to attack those who abuse their power.\n\nFielding's expanded version of \"Tom Thumb\", \"The Tragedy of Tragedies\", first ran on 24 March 1731. Its printed edition was \"edited\" and \"commented\" on by Fielding's pseudonym H. Scriblerus Secundus who pretends not to be the original author, and it contains a frontispiece by Hogarth, which serves as the earliest proof of a relationship between Fielding and Hogarth. There are few major changes to the plot's outline except that Grizzle became Tom's rival for Huncamunca's heart, and Tom is not killed by Grizzle. Instead, Tom is able to defeat Grizzle, which changes the outcome of the play. Furthermore, there is an emphasis on faulty language and Fielding emphasises the problems within poorly written tragedies.\n\nFielding's ninth play, the unsuccessful \"The Letter Writers Or, a New Way to Keep a Wife at Home\", ran for four nights as a companion piece to \"The Tragedy of Tragedies\" but was soon after replaced by \"The Welsh Opera\" on 22 April 1731. The play followed two characters whose wives are busy having affairs and how they attempt to keep their wives faithful. The immoral characters are forgiven within the play and there is a lack of moral commentary within the plot.\n\nThe tenth play and new companion piece to \"The Tragedy of Tragedies\", \"The Welsh Opera\", ran many times until it was expanded into \"The Grub-Street Opera\". The expanded version of the play, \"The Grub-Street Opera\", was not put on for an audience, which provoked E. Rayner to print \"The Welsh Opera\" without Fielding's consent. The play serves both as a tribute to the Scriblerians, especially Gay and Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera\", and to put forth a political allegory that satirises Walpole's government and the British monarchy. In particular, it mocked the feud between Walpole and Pulteney, a Privy Councillor.\n\nThe expanded and altered version of \"The Welsh Opera\", \"The Grub-Street Opera\", was first rehearsed in May 1731, but it never ran on stage. It was printed and exists in a complete printed format, and it is possible that it was not performed because of government intervention. Its original printing was done without Fielding's consent, and it is uncertain as to when Fielding's official version of the play was printed. The plot focuses on a standard love story but with characters that exhibit less than virtuous characteristics. The title pokes fun at the \"Grub Street Journal\" and also links to the theme within the plot of attacking theatre in general.\n\nAfter Fielding returned to working with the Royal Theatre, Drury Lane, he wrote \"The Lottery\", which first ran on 1 January 1732 alongside Addison's \"Cato\". The play was successful and was performed 15 times during January. He altered the play in February, and the revised form ran for 14 more nights during that season and was put on each year until 1740 and occasionally thereafter until 1783. The story deals with Chloe's desire to play the lottery and pokes fun at the London lottery system and those who support it.\n\nFielding's thirteenth play, \"The Modern Husband\", first ran on 14 February 1732. The play ran for 13 nights at Drury Lane, rivalling the run of the \"Provok'd Husband\" and \"Zara\" for production length. Although early-20th-century critics believed that the play could not be popular, it did make money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The play was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the play died soon after and the plot of the play discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts. The plot deals with a man selling his wife for money and the attempted abuse of the adultery laws.\n\n\"The Old Debauchees\", originally titled \"The Despairing Debauchee\", appeared with \"The Covent-Garden Tragedy\" on 1 June 1732. The play ran for six nights and was later paired with \"The Mock Doctor\". The play was later revived to attack Catholics during the disputes with the Stuarts between 1745 and 1746. The play alludes to the 1731 trial of Father Girard, a Jesuit tried for using magic during an attempted seduction/rape of a young girl. The nature of the attacks against Catholicism within the play undermines the overall humour of the play.\n\nAlthough \"The Covent-Garden Tragedy\" appeared with \"The Old Debauchees\", it was not a success like the other play and quickly dropped. The Covent Garden Tragedy was immediately ended after its first night because, according to Fielding, of the play's use of a brothel as a setting. After all, the plot focuses on a love triangle between characters in a brothel. Even though the first night fell apart, the play was later performed; it eventually appeared again for four nights with \"Don Quixote in England\", once on its own in 1734, and a few later times during the 18th century, including as a puppet show.\n\nFielding's sixteenth play, \"The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd\", replaced \"The Covent Garden Tragedy\" as the companion play to \"The Old Debauchees\". The play is an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's \"Le Medecin malgre Lui\". It first ran on 23 June 1732 and was later revised in 1732; both versions were very successful. The plot deals with a young girl pretending to be mute to avoid having to marry a man she does not like while her doctor is really a man pretending to be a doctor to con the other characters.\n\nIn 1728, John Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera\" was extremely successful and ran for 62 times during the season, an unprecedented length of time. The play began to change London theatre through the introduction of political themes and experimentation in form. Following this trend, Fielding pushed politics into the forefront of his plays. This provoked criticism from all sides, including from the playwright Colley Cibber. However, \"The Beggar's Opera\" is not Fielding's only influence; Fielding is part of the theatrical tradition surrounding him, and, as Harold Pagliaro points out, \"Fielding's first play, like all those to follow, is among other things an accommodation to the world of theatre in which he worked.\"\n\nFielding was concerned with the audience's reaction to his various scenes. This is internally reflected in the actions of the character Merital in \"Love in Several Masques\" in controlling the behaviour of Helen and that many of his characters believe that they are either actors or are performing on a stage. Also, this is a primary concern of Fielding's when he crafted his Scriblerian plays.\n\nReading and how reading defines characters is a focus within many plays and in Fielding's later works. In \"Love in Several Masques\", the character Wisemore focuses on classics but ignores contemporary society. Similarly, the character Wilding, in \"The Temple Beau\", practices law but doesn't read at all. Reading is an outlet to understanding humanity, and Fielding uses his plays to inform an audience how to better understand humanity.\n\nMorality and moral characters was an important concern within Fielding's works, and his first play serves as a representation for Fielding's believes surrounding the relationship between morality and libertine beliefs that is found throughout his work. The plays also introduces most of the character types that Fielding would reuse throughout his plays and novels. However, his use of libertine themes and characters served as a way for those like Pat Rogers to believe that Fielding lacked an orthodox understanding of Christianity; he believes that Fielding was harsh towards hypocrisy but not against other actions. In particular, Rogers claims, \"Fielding was generous enough in that sphere of morality, however implacable he might be in his larger political and religious attachment. Provided that soldiers were brave and loyal he did not require their lives to be models of absolute purity.\" Tiffany Potter follows this idea by claiming, \"Eliminating a moral imperative to drama (and to life in general) gives Fielding the liberty to create unconventional characters and to set plays anywhere from ballrooms to brothels without having to defend anything more than his own stance on issues. The necessity of even that defence, however, is usually negated by his libertine belief in privilege.\n\nGender plays a large role within Fielding's moral critique, and effeminacy is a means to emphasise a male character's moral shortcomings or problematic deviations from social and cultural traditions. Starting with \"Love in Several Masques\", the stock characters that he relies on emphasise the deviations by recalling traditional behavioural stereotypes and in their commentary on the masculinity or femininity of other characters. The political implications for gender extend to a criticism of powerful female within the domestic and public domains. Many of the problems portrayed within the plays are the results of the domestic sphere extended into politics, especially within \"Tom Thumb\". As Jill Campbell points out, not only does Fielding critique women in power, but the reversals of gender and power serve as a way to say that private concerns are taking priority over public concerns. In his plays and his novels, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans, which includes both emotions and morality. Although Fielding sometimes uses females to express ideal ways to act, he does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality to dominate and assume power. This theme appears as early as \"Love in Several Masques\" and continues throughout, especially in prose parody \"Shamela\" where Shamela falsifies claims to virtue to control and get ahead in life.\n\nFielding does not limit his analysis of gender roles to just the living; the image of the ghost plays a significant part in many of Fielding's plays, including \"The Author's Farce\", the \"Tom Thumb\" plays, and \"The Covent Garden Tragedy\". Even though Fielding fails to explain what the existence of ghosts means, the image of the ghost can serve as a metaphor for Fielding's expectation of women who are supposed to be publicly virtuous. According to Campbell,\nwoman bears the representational burden for Fielding of his disappointment about the relation between internal and external selves, as, culturally, she must sustain the realm of private life, interior feeling, and personal identity apart from the public and commercial world of the male; inevitably, then, she must fail Fielding through her reliance on the 'harlotry' of pomp, ostentation, or the drama of self-display if she is to be a part of this world. And yet, he fears her alternative fate as a ghost as well, though he may seem to wish it on her.\n\nNot every critic sees that Fielding sets up an inevitable fall for women. Potter argues that:\nWomen are neither victims of deceitful men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who can choose to 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them. In the earliest examples of the redefinition that develops throughout Fielding's works, virtue is no longer simply virginity, but something malleable and powerful in the hands of a woman granted the agency and intelligence to determine her own sexuality.\nCounter to Campbell, Potter seems to emphasise how gender is removed and emphasises that Fielding sees gender as a social construct. There is a balancing of the genders and neither is favoured over the other. To Potter, \"Only the weakening of humanity through cross-adoption of the most ridiculous qualities of either gender is attacked in Fielding's plays.\"\n\nThe reception of Fielding's plays received early recognition; his early plays placed him in a position of popularity alongside Gay.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw believed that Fielding was \"the greatest practising dramatist, with the single exception of Shakespeare, produced in England between the Middle Ages and the nineteenth century.\" However, modern critics rarely agree with Shaw, as Robert Hume points out, \"Few scholars have been much interested in Fielding's highly successful career as a dramatist. To most it has seemed a false start. Readers tend to find the conventional plays derivative and sentimental, the topical ones scrappy and superficial.\" In particular, only one book until 1988 was published on the topic, which was Ducrocq's \"Le theatre de Fielding, 1728–1737, et ses prolongements dans l'oeuvre romanesque\". This critical approach is not limited to just Fielding, but to the whole field; the reputation of Colley Cibber was ruined by Pope's characterising him as the Arch Dunce and \"Since the plays of Cibber's only serious rival, Henry Fielding, are hardly even read these days, let alone performed, the earlier eighteenth-century theater tends to be passed over with (at best) a polite cough.\"\n\nJ. Paul Hunter believes that:\nFielding's plays do not prophesy that he will become a major novelist, but the direction of his theatrical career does suggest concerns that increasingly led him away from pure representation [...] Fielding's separation from the theatre was a forced one, but the expulsion was fortunate, freeing him from a relationship and commitment that had always been in some sense against the grain [...] Fielding's way is not really very dramatic, either in novels or in plays; he never developed stage-likely objective correlatives, having reserved his artistic energy for the examining process in which the action is rerun again and again, reviewed, considered, nearly masticated.\n\nTo Albert Rivero, ten of the plays \"mark significant moments in [Fielding's] theatrical life\": \"Love in Several Masques\", \"The Temple Beau\", \"The Author's Farce\", \"Tom Thumb\", \"The Tragedy of Tragedies\", \"Rape upon Rape\", \"The Grub Street Opera\", \"The Modern Husband\", \"Pasquin\", and \"The Historical Register\". Similarly, Potter organised the plays by a general theme of developing libertine characters and believed that \"Fielding's most successful group of plays followed \"Love in Several Masques\" both chronologically and thematically. Comedies and burlesques such as \"The Author's Farce\", \"The Tragedy of Tragedies\", \"The Old Debauchees\", and \"Pasquin\" made Fielding the most popular playwright of the 1730s, and all of these plays contain characters, situations, and dialogues that invoke libertine philosophy in some way, thought they vary in the explicitness of the depiction.\" In his biography of Fielding, Pagliaro declares that \"Between 1727 and 1737, by which time he was only 30 years old, Fielding became England's most successful living playwright.\"\n\n"}

Now largely forgotten, his historical paintings earned him considerable attention in his day.\n\nBorn in Lutterbach in Alsace, Scherrer was brought up by his uncle following the death of his father when he was only 6 years old. After leaving school, he worked at the Haeffley factory in Pfastatt where his talent for drawing was noticed by one of the directors. In 1871, after the Treaty of Frankfurt he chose French nationality and moved to Paris where he was taught by Pierre-Jules Cavelier in the studio of Félix-Joseph Barrias. Barrias encouraged him to continue his studies at the École des Beaux-Arts where he came under the guidance of Alexandre Cabanel, whose academic style he closely followed.\n\nAlthough Scherrer began to exhibit in 1877, it was his \"Résurrection du fils de la veuve de Naïm\" at the Salon de l'Académie de Peinture which established his reputation. In 1881, his painting \" L'Assassinat du maréchal Brune\" was received with particular success, earning him a stipendium which allowed him to spend two years in Italy. On his return to Paris in 1883, he painted \"Beaurepaire, la capitulation de Verdun, le 2 septembre 1792\". He went on to receive awards for \" L'Entrée de Jeanne d'Arc à Orléans, victorieuse des Anglais\" (1887) and \"Isabeau de Bavière\" (1889), exhibited the same year at the Exposition Universelle, and \"Charlotte Corday à Caen\" (1892). At the end of the century, after decorating the SEITA pavilion for the Exposition Universelle (1900), he was made a knight of the Legion of Honour.\n\nIn addition to his academic works which were painted with almost photographic precision, Scherrer also painted nudes and copied the works of Raphaël in Italy and those of other masters exhibited in the Louvre. He also painted landscapes of northern France, the Netherlands and Italy, and genre paintings including \"Joueurs de dames\". Other important works are \"Rachel déclamant la tragédie de Phèdre, devant Alfred de Musset\" and \"L'Heure du lait en Haute Alsace\". He also painted animals (\"Chevaux à l'abri\") and portraits (\"Gaston Roullet\").\n\nFor a period of 32 years, Scherrer exhibited his works in Paris, Barcelona, Chicago and Tunis. Today they can be seen in France, Canada and the United States. Following his death in Paris in May 1916, there was an exhibition of his work in 1920. In 2006, a large exhibition of his work was held in his native Lutterbach.\n\nAlthough Scherrer is not well known today, eclipsed as he is by contemporary impressionists, he was well received in the early 20th century. A commentator for the \"Journal d'Alsace\" wrote: \"Scherrer's is characterized by constant attention to form and composition. A powerful colourist, with the gift of a fruitful imagination, our famous countryman is one of the most highly esteemed artists of our times.\"\n\nIn 1880, Scherrer married Mathilde Haquette, a porcelain decorator at the Sèvres factory. They had two children: Jean who died at sea when he was 18, and Lucie-Marthe (1884–1979) who was very close to her father.\n\nThis article also draws on the .\n"}

He is usually portrayed as a child, although in some interpretations, he is said to be a young man.\n\nArguably, the \"Juan Tamad\" story most often told illustrates his utmost laziness to the point of stupidity that it becomes comedic. In it, Juan Tamad comes upon a guava tree bearing ripe fruit. Being too slothful to climb the tree and take the fruits, he instead decides to lie beneath the tree and let gravity do its work. There he remained, waiting for the fruit to fall into his gaping mouth.\n\nOther \"Juan Tamad\" stories include:\n\n\n\n\nA book published by an unknown author in 1919 in Manila entitled \"Buhay na Pinagdaanan ni Juan Tamad na Anac ni Fabio at ni Sofia sa Caharian nang Portugal\" (Tagalog for \"The Life lived by Juan Tamad, son of Fabio and Sofia, in the Kingdom of Portugal\") contains a poem consisting of 78 pages of four-line stanzas at seven stanzas per page.

{"id": "56651458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56651458", "title": "Kamal Haasan's unrealized projects", "text": "Kamal Haasan's unrealized projects\n\nThe following is a list of unproduced Kamal Haasan projects in roughly chronological order. During his long career, Indian film actor-director Kamal Haasan has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his acting commitments or direction. Some of these projects fell into development hell or were officially cancelled.\n\nTelugu director Tatineni Rama Rao started working on the film in 1984, which was a social drama centred upon a terminally ill patient and a doctor. Kamal Haasan and Amitabh Bachchan worked on the film which revolved around the notion of euthanasia. However, after shooting a substantial portion of the film, it was shelved.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Muktha Srinivasan planned to direct a film based on the American film \"The Godfather\" (1972) with Sivaji Ganesan, Kamal Haasan and Amala. He paid them an advance and confirmed their dates; however the project was dropped after Kamal Haasan's then associate Ananthu felt that it would be a Ganesan-focused film and not a Kamal film.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Gangai Amaran agreed terms to direct a film titled \"Athi Veerapandiyan\" starring Kamal Haasan in the lead role. The film was based on jallikattu and Aishwarya was signed to portray the leading female role. However Kamal Haasan later opted out of the film and instead began work on another rural drama, \"Thevar Magan\" (1992), directed by Bharathan. He later credited Gangai Amaran for the idea of the song \"Sandhu Pottu\" from the film, which was initially meant for \"Athi Veerapandiyan\".\n\nIn 2016, Gangai Amaran alleged that his brother Ilaiyaraaja had effectively told Kamal Haasan to stop working on the project, during an ego clash between the two brothers.\n\nBalachandra Menon wanted to remake his Malayalam film \"Ammayane Sathyam\" (1993) into Tamil, and turned down remake offers from other directors. Producer Raveendran signed on Kamal Haasan to do the film and recruited S. P. Balasubrahmanyam to take another role. The team initially approached Annie, who starred in the original to reprise her role as the lead female character, though her reluctance meant that the team picked newcomer Ruchita Prasad, who adopted a stage name of Jayasandhya.\n\nThe makers abandoned the project due to creative differences. It was later alleged that Kamal Haasan had wanted his role to be more prominent than the character from the original version. Kamal Haasan subsequently moved on to begin work on \"Avvai Shanmughi\" (1996), and recruited several members of the cast of \"Kanden Seethaiyai\" to work on his next project.\n\nA remake of the Tamil film \"Magalir Mattum\" (1994), the film is yet to have a theatrical release for unknown reasons. Produced by Kamal Haasan, \"Ladies Only\" is the story of three women, Seema Biswas, Shilpa Shirodkar and Heera Rajagopal working in the same office. They are constantly harassed by their lecherous boss Randhir Kapoor. The three decide to gang up against him to teach a lesson, but a strange accident complicates things when the boss lands in a hospital and the three women end up with the dead body of a terrorist, played by Kamal Haasan.\n\nKamal Haasan had been pondering directing a historical film for a period of four to five years, when writer Sujatha suggested that Kamal Haasan looked at a folk ballad edited by Tamil scholar Vanamamalai, which introduced them to the historical figure of Muhammed Yusuf Khan, an 18th-century warrior. Kamal Haasan immediately agreed at the prospect and felt that the story had all the potential of a good historical film, being appealed to by the elevation from the nadir to the top of Khan's life. Sujatha revealed that nearly 80% of the film would faithfully adapt Samuel Charles Hill's biography of Khan, also known as Marudhanayagam, and to only use imagination where no solid or substantial information is available.\n\nThe producers and Kamal Haasan managed to rope in Queen Elizabeth II to appear as the chief guest at the launch of the project which took place in the MGR Film City on 16 October 1997. The launch also saw the inaugural shot canned with Kamal Haasan, in the persona of Marudhanayagam, hearing and reacting to an imperial announcement read out by the character played by Nassar, with Om Puri's character looking on. Official filming began several months later in Velangudi on 10 August 1998 with a scene of where a companion of the lead character, played by Kamal Haasan, is hanged prompting a brief altercation.\n\nWorks on \"Marudhanayagam\" suddenly ceased after a British company that had planned to co-produce the film backed out and the film has been indefinitely postponed since. Haasan had invested 8 crores of his own wealth into the project through and has since revealed that the film would be revived at a future date. Since 1999, Kamal Haasan has consistently spoken of plans to revive the film.\n\nKamal Haasan had written the script of \"Londonil Kameshwaran\" and wanted to play the lead role in the late 1990s, but never got down to making it because he felt it would not have been cost-effective. Through the project, he had aimed to reprise his character of the Palakkad Brahmin cook Kameshwaran from \"Michael Madana Kama Rajan\" (1990) and place him in funny situations when he visits London. He had briefly considered making the film in early 1999 after \"Marudhanayagam\" had run into production troubles, but instead chose to prioritise his commitments for \"Hey Ram\" (2000). After the profitable \"Pammal K. Sambandam\" (2002), Mouli asked Haasan to re-collaborate with this particular script but Haasan was uninterested. Madhavan was selected by Haasan to replace him, after the pair had shot for \"Anbe Sivam\" together in the period, and the project was made under Haasan's production house with the title of \"Nala Damayanthi\" (2003).\n\nFollowing the completion of his first directorial venture in Hindi, \"Nayak\" (2001), S. Shankar announced his next project, \"Robot\", which was to feature Kamal Haasan and Preity Zinta. The film was to be produced by the now-defunct company Media Dreams, a division of Pentamedia Graphics. The film was reported to be a futuristic techno-thriller set in Chennai in around 2200 or 3000 AD. Despite the completion of a photoshoot featuring Haasan and Zinta, the project was shelved as a result of scheduling conflicts with Haasan. Shankar consequently started work on \"Boys\" (2003). The film was eventually revived and released in 2010 as \"Enthiran\" starring Rajinikanth and Aishwarya Rai.\n\nIn February 2004, Kamal Haasan and Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao began pre-production works on a project titled \"Krishna Leela\". The film was set to narrate the story of an individual called Krishna Das, played by Kamal Haasan, and the women in his life. The project was described as a comedy entertainer, much like the actor and director's previous collaborations in the 1990s. Gautami was reported to feature alongside him in a leading role, in a proposed comeback, while actresses Rohini and Vinodhini were also cast in roles. Comedians including Goundamani, Vadivelu, Senthil, Vivek and Chitti Babu were also added to the supporting cast. Seeking to cast two new actresses, Kamal Haasan scouted for talent in London. The film was later dropped, and Kamal Haasan and Rao considered working together for a different project. \n\nIn May 2004, Kamal Haasan and Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao were keen to make a Hindi and Tamil bilingual film titled \"Kumar Sambhavam\" with Madhuri Dixit as the lead actress. Kamal Haasan stated he needed a \"woman of substance who would look convincing as a wife and mother\" and stated there was \"no second choice\" for the role. Bharat Shah was set to finance the project and negotiated terms with Dixit to work on the project, having earlier worked with her during the making of \"Devdas\" (2002).\n\nThe film was dropped after Dixit quoted a salary, which was more than the whole cost of the film itself. Kamal Haasan later expressed his disappointment at the film not materialising as a result of Dixit's refusal.\n\nKamal Haasan, Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao and Ramesh Aravind discussed the script of a film titled \"KG\" in early 2004, usually during Kamal Haasan's visits to Bangalore. Described as a \"cop thriller\" to be shot in Tamil and Kannada around Bangalore, Kamal Haasan revealed that there would be no female lead and that it would be \"quite a change\" from his other films. In a turn of events, Kamal Haasan accepted an offer to star in Saran's \"Vasool Raja MBBS\" (2004), and put \"KG\" on hold. He later continued to work on \"KG\", which marked Ramesh Aravind's directorial debut, and Mumbai-based financier Bharat Shah agreed to fund the film. The trio later decided to indefinitely postpone work on the project.\n\n\"Marmayogi\" was first pondered by Kamal Haasan after the release of \"Aalavandhan\" (2001), however nothing proceeded. After a four-year sabbatical from directing films since \"Virumaandi\" (2004), Kamal Haasan announced \"Marmayogi\" as his next project after the completion of \"Dasavathaaram\" (2008). The film was planned as a bilingual Hindi-Tamil period film, set in the 7th century. Production house Pyramid Saimira along with Haasan's company Raaj Kamal Films International were set to produce the venture, and work began in late 2007. Early media reports suggested a box-office battle between \"Marmayogi\" and Shankar's \"Enthiran\" (2010), which was rebooted from the shelved \"Robot\".\n\nPre-production on the film continued throughout 2008, with technicians such as Rajesh Selva and Sanu Varghese actively involved for close to a year. Meanwhile, Kamal Haasan grew a long, thick beard for the film. He also cast actors Mohanlal and Venkatesh, as well as, actresses including Hema Malini, Trisha and Shriya Saran in pivotal roles. Along with Trisha, Kamal Haasan held a photoshoot at the AVM Studios in August 2008. Following the failure of Rajinikanth's \"Kuselan\" (2008), Pyramid Saimira opted out of the project in November 2008, effectively shelving the film. Kamal Haasan subsequently moved on to begin work on \"Unnaipol Oruvan\" (2009), and later filed a legal complaint against Pyramid Saimira for loss of earnings.\n\nThe project was first reported in the media in November 2008 as Kamal Haasan's next project, after his historical drama \"Marmayogi\" was shelved as a result of Pyramid Saimira's financial problems. Titled \"Thalaivan Irukkiraan\" and described by the Times of India as an \"action adventure\" film, it was said to be directed by Kamal Haasan and co-produced by Gemini Film Circuit and Sun Pictures, with A. R. Rahman working as the music composer. Pre-production works continued throughout late 2008, with actors such as Rishi Kapoor, Mohanlal and Venkatesh approached for leading roles. Actresses Trisha and Shriya Saran, who were originally a part of \"Marmayogi\", were expected to be retained for the film in order to use the dates they had allotted for the shelved film. Kamal Haasan's Raaj Kamal Films International registered the film's title but production was postponed after a deal could not be agreed with the proposed co-producers. During the period, Kamal Haasan also pitched the idea of financing the film to Udhayanidhi Stalin of Red Giant Movies, who did not take up the offer citing that he felt the script was too political. He later used the dates offered by Mohanlal and Venkatesh for another of his productions, \"Unnaipol Oruvan\" (2009), which was incorrectly reported in the media as being the same project as \"Thalaivan Irukkiraan\". In November 2010, Kamal Haasan revealed that he was busy writing the final draft of the film and would look to start production by March 2011 with American producers. Actress Anushka Shetty was also reported to have accepted to star in the film during the period, but the film was again stalled.\n\nIn January 2012, the film resurfaced with Kamal Haasan confirming that the film would be simultaneously made in Hindi under the title of \"Amar Hain\". The media reported that the film would be produced by Aascar Ravichandran, with actors Mohanlal, Ajith Kumar, Ravi Teja and Katrina Kaif also in the cast, though this later proved to be untrue. Reports later in February 2012, suggested that Kamal Haasan had asked Shankar to direct the film, with Jackie Chan, Salman Khan, Prabhas and Asin amongst others speculated to be a part of the project. Chakri Toleti was also reportedly approached to be the film's director during July 2012, but the project still did not materialise. After three years of inactivity, in June 2015, Kamal Haasan announced that he was reviving the film and that Saif Ali Khan would feature alongside him in a leading role. Associating with Hindi producers Virender K. Arora and Arjun N. Kapoor, Kamal Haasan revealed that the project would be a \"contemporary story, touching on politics, finance and the underworld\" and \"an action film with lots of emotion\", while comparing the film to Brian De Palma's English film, \"The Untouchables\" (1987). He added that the film would be shot in Mumbai and Delhi in India, with schedules also planned in Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States, while also that he would finish scripting the film after he finished work on the production of \"Thoongaa Vanam\" (2015). Despite the announcements, the producers backed out of the project and the film was again stalled.\n\nAfter two more years of inactivity, in July 2017, Kamal Haasan suggested that he would revive the project after the release of his ongoing projects \"Vishwaroopam 2\" (2018) and \"Sabaash Naidu\" (2018).\n\nIn mid-2008, Kamal Haasan agreed terms to be a part of an Indo-Japanese production titled \"19 Steps\" to be directed by Bharat Bala. The film was written by Malayalam scriptwriter, M. T. Vasudevan Nair and was set to tell the tale of a Samurai warrior trying to conquer the ancient Indian martial art of Kalaripayattu. Starring alongside Asin and Tadanobu Asano, Kamal Haasan was set to play the role of an Indian martial arts guru. The film was being produced by Walt Disney and pre-production work had begun with large portions set to be shot in Kerala. Twenty days before the film began shoot, Kamal Haasan dropped out and the film was subsequently reported to be shelved indefinitely. As recently as 2016, Bharat Bala and producer Phillip Lee have expressed their desire to continue the film with a different cast.\n\nIn mid-2009, Kamal Haasan agreed terms to work with Mysskin on a film about Buddha. Following the cancellation of \"Marmayogi\" and \"19 Steps\", Kamal Haasan was keen to work on a historical film with a similar theme, with the project also referred to in the media as \"500 BC\". He travelled to the United States to seek out production companies who were willing to fund the film, but no studio eventually agreed. Mysskin was then forced to drop the project and revealed it took him six months to get over the disappointment of the project's sudden end.\n\nIn late 2012, Hollywood producer Barrie Osborne expressed his interest in making an English film in association with Kamal Haasan, who would direct the project and feature in the lead role. The actor subsequently announced a project titled \"Moo\" in February 2013, which was said to be about three lives. A potential English title of \"Triple Impact\" was speculated, while other sources titled the film as \"Yaavarum Kelir\", with an English title of \"All Are Kin\". The project later failed to develop. In 2017, sources suggested that the film was still under consideration.\n\nIn November 2015, Kamal Haasan and T. K. Rajeev Kumar agreed to collaborate on a project and announced that they were working on a family drama script to be titled \"Amma Appa Vilayattu\" in Tamil and \"Amma Naana Aata\" in Telugu. After initial discussions with Sridevi failed to materialise, Rajeev Kumar cast Amala Akkineni and Zarina Wahab in pivotal roles and announced that the film would be shot entirely across the United States, with schedules in New York and Georgia. The film was later postponed and by early 2016, Kamal Haasan chose to collaborate with Rajeev Kumar on a different project that he had written himself, \"Sabaash Naidu\" (2018).\n"}

The company produces opera, operetta and musicals.\n\nThe opera house is located on Behrenstraße, just a few steps from Unter den Linden. Since 2004, the Komische Oper Berlin, along with the Berlin State Opera, the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Berlin State Ballet, and the Bühnenservice Berlin (Stage and Costume Design), has been a member of the Berlin Opera Foundation.\n\nThe theatre was built between 1891 and 1892 by architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer for a private society. It first opened on 24 September 1892 as \"Theater Unter den Linden\" with Adolf Ferron's operetta \"Daphne\" and Gaul and Haßreiter's ballet \"Die Welt in Bild und Tanz\".\n\nThe theatre was primarily a vehicle for operetta, but was also used for various other events and balls. Around 800 people could be seated in the stalls, and the balconies and various en-suite dinner rooms housed about a further 1,700 seats. Its directors went bankrupt in 1896 and the theatre was forced to close its doors.\n\nOn 3 September 1898 the theatre was reopened as \"Metropol-Theater\" with Julius Freund's revue \"Paradies der Frauen\". It then grew to become one of Berlin's most famous and successful variety theatres. During the 1920s and early 1930s, it was leased by the brothers Alfred and Fritz Rotter. Under their management, it saw the premieres of two operettas by Franz Lehár - \"Friederike (opera)\" in 1928 and Das Land des Lächelns in 1929, both starring Richard Tauber. However, due to a decline of variety and music hall entertainment the theatre was again closed in 1933.\n\nIn 1934 the theatre was nationalised and renamed \"Staatliches Operettentheater\". It operated as part of the Nazi \"Kraft durch Freude\" entertainment and leisure programmes. During World War II, the auditorium was damaged by Allied bombing on 7 May 1944. The façade, entrance hall, and auditorium ceiling murals were destroyed by bombs on 9 March 1945.\n\nAfter the war, the theatre was in East Germany, being that the building was in the eastern part of Berlin. Following repair works and provisional rebuilding, the theatre reopened on 23 December 1947, as the \"Komische Oper\" with Johann Strauss's operetta \"Die Fledermaus\".\n\nThe 1950s saw various further alterations and extensions. The theatre was completely rebuilt in 1965/1966 by Architektenkollektiv Kunz Nierade, adding functional extensions and giving the theatre a completely new exterior. The theatre reopened again on 4 December 1966, with Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\". The auditorium underwent further restoration in 1986, and the stage technology was further modernised by 1989. Today the theatre seats 1,270.\n\nIn 1947, Walter Felsenstein founded and led the resident opera company, the \"Komische Oper\", until his death in 1975. Götz Friedrich was an assistant to Felsenstein at the company. Joachim Herz became general director after Felsenstein's death and served until 1981. Subsequently, Harry Kupfer directed the company for 21 seasons, until 2002. The company specializes in German language productions of opera, operetta and musicals. In 2007 the company won, jointly with Oper Bremen, the \"Opera house of the year\" award by the German magazine \"Opernwelt\". From 2002 to 2012, the company's chief director and \"Intendant\" was . In June 2008, the company announced the appointment of Barrie Kosky to succeed Homoki as its next \"Intendant\", as of the 2012/2013 season. In October 2014, his contract with the company was extended through 2022. Since 2005, the company's managing director has been Susanne Moser.\n\nFrom 1966 to 2004, the theatre was also home to a resident ballet company – first as the \"Tanztheater der Komischen Oper\", and then from 1999 as \"BerlinBallett – Komische Oper\". In 2004, due to budgetary problems, the separate ballet companies of Berlin's three opera houses were merged into a single company called the Staatsballett Berlin.\n\nPast General Music Directors (GMD) of the company have included Kurt Masur, Rolf Reuter, Yakov Kreizberg, Kirill Petrenko, Carl St.Clair, and Patrick Lange.

The song became popular among the soldiery as well as civilians, but was not set to music until 1918 by Félix Boyer, bandmaster of the Algerian Garrison.\n\nThe lyrics were modified in 1943 to include all Africans who identified as Frenchmen or Pieds-noirs, especially those from the Arab world. Also changed were references to location, as most singers had returned to the colonies. Ironically, this situation has again reversed itself in the meantime. This 1943 version was dedicated to Lt.Col. van Hecke's who fought the 1944-45 Italian, French and German Allied military campaigns.\n\nThe song was reportedly being used by the Europeans supporting the status quo of French Algeria against its independence supported by president Charles de Gaulle. Because of that the song was forbidden from the French military until it was authorized again, in 1969.\n\n\"Le Chant des Africains\" remains today an adopted symbol of identity for the Pied-noir community.\n\nBelow are the lyrics of the first stanza and refrain of the 1914 and 1944 versions.\n\n"}

{"id": "1892706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1892706", "title": "Lincoln Portrait", "text": "Lincoln Portrait\n\nLincoln Portrait (also known as A Lincoln Portrait) is a classical orchestral work written by the American composer Aaron Copland. The work involves a full orchestra, with particular emphasis on the brass section at climactic moments. The work is narrated with the reading of excerpts of Abraham Lincoln's great documents, including the Gettysburg Address. An orchestra usually invites a prominent person to be the narrator.\n\nCopland was asked to write a musical portrait of an \"eminent American\" by the conductor Andre Kostelanetz. Copland used material from speeches and letters of Lincoln and quoted original folk songs of the period, including \"Camptown Races\" and \"On Springfield Mountain\". \nCopland finished \"Lincoln Portrait\" in April 1942.\n\nThe first performance was by the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra on 14 May 1942, with William Adams as the narrator.\n\nTogether with some descriptive comments on Lincoln (\"Abe Lincoln was a quiet and a melancholy man\"), the work contains the following excerpts from his speeches:\nFellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or\ninsignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation. We, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility. (Annual Message to Congress [since the twentieth century, State of the Union], December 1, 1862)\n\nThe dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country. (Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862)\n\nIt is the eternal struggle between two principles, right and wrong, throughout the world. It is the same spirit that says 'you toil and work and earn bread, and I'll eat it.' No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation, and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle. (Lincoln–Douglas debates, October 15, 1858)\n\nAs I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy. (Unknown, though in Lincoln's \"Collected Works\")\n\nThat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion. That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth. (Gettysburg Address)\n\"Lincoln Portrait\" is scored for speaker and orchestra:\n\nNotable narrators of \"Lincoln Portrait\" have included:\n\nJuana Sujo, an Argentine actress resident in Venezuela and an opponent of the repressive regime of Venezuelan President Marcos Pérez Jiménez, was credited with sparking the popular uprising that led to his removal from power. Aaron Copland had come to Caracas to conduct the first Venezuelan performance of \"Lincoln Portrait\" on March 27, 1957. A \"New York Times\" reviewer said it had a \"magical effect\" on the audience.\n\nAs Copland recalled, \"To everyone's surprise, the reigning dictator, who had rarely dared to be seen in public, arrived at the last possible moment.\" On that evening Juana Sujo was the fiery narrator who performed the spoken-word parts of the piece. When she spoke the final words, \"... that government of the people, by the people, for the people (el gobierno del pueblo, por el pueblo y para el pueblo) shall not perish from the earth,\" the audience rose and began cheering and shouting so loudly that Copland could not hear the remainder of the music. Copland continued, \"It was not long after that the dictator was deposed and fled from the country. I was later told by an American foreign service officer that the \"Lincoln Portrait\" was credited with having inspired the first public demonstration against him. That, in effect, it had started a revolution.\"\n\nThe composition was lampooned by Peter Schickele (\"P. D. Q. Bach\") in his piece \"Bach Portrait\" on the album \"1712 Overture and Other Musical Assaults\". Another parody, \"A Quayle Portrait\" by Jeff Ehrhart, features quotes from former U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle.\n\nNine minutes of the composition, without narration (from a late 1960s recording by the London Symphony Orchestra), plays during the climactic one-on-one sequence between Jake and Jesus Shuttlesworth (played by Denzel Washington and Ray Allen) in the 1998 Spike Lee film, \"He Got Game\". In the film, Jesus Shuttlesworth is a student at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn.\n\n"}

They are low on dialogue and explicit story exposition, and instead use images, vivid details, music, and sound design to create their worlds. In April 2013 she was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. In 2015, she was named as a member of the jury for the main competition at the 2015 Venice Film Festival.\n\nBorn in Glasgow on 5 December 1969, Ramsay studied photography at Napier College, Edinburgh. In 1995, she graduated from the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield, England, where she specialised in cinematography and direction.\n\nRamsay took a break in-between \"Black and White Town\" and \"We Need to Talk About Kevin\", explaining she thinks the filmmaking process is different for her, and other writer-directors, than it is for directors who don’t write their own material. The Harvard Film Archive welcomed Lynne Ramsay for a showcase of her films, including the three acclaimed shorts that inaugurated her career.\n\nShe experienced great personal frustration in her involvement with \"The Lovely Bones,\" during which personal and professional setbacks and mishandling saw her lose the job of directing to Peter Jackson, whose version of the film received largely negative reviews. She stated in an interview with Oliver Lyttelton that \"People started to call it 'The Lovely Money,' they were getting greedy around it. And I could feel the vibes. It became like the Holy Bible, I kept handing in drafts and I thought they were good, but it was like 'But that's not exactly like the book, the book's going to be a success.' That was the mistake they made with the project.\" She stated additionally that she considered Jackson's interpretation of the film, with a desire to stick as closely as possible to the original story, was partially responsible for what she considered the lacklustre quality of the finished product.\n\nRamsay won the 1996 Cannes Prix de Jury for her graduation film, the short \"Small Deaths\". Her second short film, \"Kill the Day\", won the Clermont Ferrand Prix du Jury; her third, \"Gasman\", won her another Cannes Prix du Jury in addition to a Scottish BAFTA for Best Short Film.\n\n\"Small Deaths\" (1996) is Ramsay's debut short film that she completed as her graduating film at the UK's National Film and Television School. Small Deaths is a series of three vignettes of children grappling with familial realities and the repercussions of their actions. (1996, video, 11 minutes). Ramsay is the Writer, Director and cinematographer for this film.\n\n\"Kill the Day\" (1996), written and directed by Ramsay, captures a day in the life of a heroin addict recently released from jail, and in the process inventively probes the inner workings of memory (1996, 35mm, 17 minutes).\n\n\"Gasman\" (1998), also written and directed by Ramsay, is about a brother and sister who attend a Christmas party with their dad, and encounter two other children who are strangely familiar with him. (1998, video, 15 minutes).\n\n\"Swimmer\" (2012), was co-commissioned by BBC Films, Film4 and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The short was nominated for the British Independent Film Awards (BIFA) in the category for Best Short Film. It won a BAFTA Award for Best Short Film at the 66th British Academy Film Awards in 2013.\n\n\"Ratcatcher\" (1999), Ramsay's debut feature, won critical acclaim and numerous awards. It was screened at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival and opened the Edinburgh International Film Festival, winning her the Guardian New Directors prize. She also won the Carl Foreman Award for Newcomer in British Film at the 2000 BAFTA Awards, the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film Festival and the Silver Hugo for Best Director at the Chicago International Film Festival.\n\n\"Morvern Callar\" (2002) won Samantha Morton the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress, and Kathleen McDermott the Scottish BAFTA Award for Best Actress. It also won the 2002 C.I.C.A.E. Award and the Award of The Youth at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. The motion picture soundtrack includes tracks from Stereolab, Aphex Twin, Broadcast, Velvet Underground, and Nancy Sinatra. Ramsay is credited as the writer and director. The film is based on Alan Warner's 1995 novel of the same name, Morvern Callar. It was featured in the Directors Fortnight for the Cannes Film Festival 2002 and then went on to open the Edinburgh International Film Festival in August of the same year. The film also featured at the Telluride, Toronto, San Sebastian, Dinard and Stockholm Film Festivals of 2002. It was nominated for seven British Independent Film Awards.\n\nRamsay was slated to direct the adaptation of Alice Sebold's \"The Lovely Bones\", which she had read in manuscript form prior to its publication. She left the project in early 2004 after the novel had become a bestseller and the producers wanted a version more faithful to the original than she had been planning.\n\n\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\" (2011) was Ramsay's next feature-length film in which she was the writer, producer and director. The film, based on Lionel Shriver's novel, is about a mother dealing with the aftermath of a school massacre committed by her son. Budgetary difficulties held the production up, but after several script drafts, the film, which employed a fragmented, elliptical narrative and starred Tilda Swinton as the tormented mother, premiered in 2011 to great acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival. Ramsay went on to receive a BAFTA nomination for Best Director as well as taking the Best Director prize at the British Independent Film Awards, and a win for Best Film Screenplay at the Writer's Guild of Great Britain.\n\nIn 2013 Ramsay was slated to direct \"Jane Got a Gun\". Natalie Portman signed on to star and produce the film as the farmer wife of an outlaw husband, who, after his gang turns on him, she must defend with the help of an old lover. In March 2013 Ramsay left the project due to creative differences with producersand funders, including over the latter's demand for a happy ending. She was replaced by Gavin O'Connor. Actor Jude Law also left the production shortly after.\n\nLynne Ramsay is scheduled to direct a modern adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\". She has stated that the film will be set in space, and deal with themes of psychology and claustrophobia, quoting \"So we're creating a whole new world, and a new alien. [It's] a very psychological piece, mainly taking place in the ship, a bit like \"Das Boot\", so it's quite claustrophobic. It's another monster movie, cos the monster's Ahab.\"\n\nRamsay directed \"You Were Never Really Here\", an adaptation of Jonathan Ames's novella of the same name. It premiered to wide critical acclaim in competition at the 70th Cannes Film Festival in 2017, where it received a seven-minute standing ovation, and Ramsay won the Best Screenplay award. The film, starring Joaquin Phoenix, was released by Amazon Studios.\n\nIn 2018 Ramsay said in an interview that she was working on her new film, a comedy.\n\nIn 2007 Ramsay was rated number 12 in Guardian Unlimited's list of the world's 40 best directors working at that time.\n\nRamsay divorced in 2013, and has one daughter.\n\nRamsay directed the promotional video for the Manchester-based indie-rock band Doves' single \"Black and White Town\", which was released on 7 February 2005. However, Ramsay's version was re-edited and the released version was significantly different from her original piece.\n\nRamsay is known for the outspoken praise and criticism she receives from her industry contemporaries.\n\nSean O'Hagan wrote in \"The Guardian\" that her \"Ramsay is entertaining company, whether talking about the art films she loves —by Bergman, Cassavetes, Fassbinder— or railing against the 'bullshitters and backstabbers' of the film industry.\"\n\nThe Harvard Film Archive describes Ramsay as \"an uncompromising filmmaker fascinated by the tremendous power of cinema to appeal directly to the senses and awaken new depths in our audio-visual imagination. Immersive and at times almost overwhelming, Ramsay's films abound with uncommon imagery arresting for its remarkable use of texture, composition, color, music and sound.\"\n\nIn her \"The New York Times\" biography, Ramsay's work is described as having a \"gritty, realistic visual style that demands attention.\"\n\nTilda Swinton, whom Ramsey directed in \"We Need To Talk About Kevin\", called her \"the real McCoy\", saying, \"She is one of those rare directors who creates the kind of films that just would not be there if she didn't make them.\"\n\nBritish film critic Jonathan Romney, when speaking on \"We Need To Talk About Kevin\", opined \"Ramsay, thinks not in concepts but in images. She doesn't make intellectual films, but ones that are close to music, taking visuals to the point of abstraction.\"\n\n\"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Mark Olsen considered Ramsay \"one of the leading lights of young British cinema\", describing her additionally as \"among the most celebrated British filmmakers of her generation.\"\n\nOn 8 October 2013, Ramsay was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Edinburgh for her contribution to British film.\n\n\n"}

It depicts a Hittite divinity. Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of Hittite art. \n\nThe relief is located in a niche about 100-120 m up a granite cliff-face of Mount Sipylus, overlooking the city of Manisa, the ancient Lydian city of Magnesia ad Sipylum, and the Gediz river valley (the ancient Hermos). It is over 6 m high and in poor condition. \n\nA seated figure 8-10 m high is depicted in high relief (but not completely separated from the cliff face), who looks northwards and wears a tall pointed headdress. Its hands seem to rest on its breasts, the feet rest atop a footstool. The head has partly cleaved away, from natural causes. \n\nTwo remnants of Luwian hieroglyphic inscriptions are visible to the right of his head, which indicate that the relief dates to the Hittite period. Cecil John Cadoux thought a date in the time of Suppiluliuma I or his son Mursili II (i.e. 14th century BC) was probable. Helmuth Theodor Bossert read the leftmost inscription (Akpınar 1) as \"Prince Kuwalanamuwa\", the same name which is found on the Hanyeri relief, but it is unclear whether both refer to the same individual. The right inscription (Akpınar 2) was not legible to Hans Gustav Güterbock, who studied the relief with R.A. Alexander in 1978.\n\nIn the second century AD, Pausanias recorded the figure in his \"Description of Greece\" as a depiction of the mother goddess, Cybele, made by Broteas the son pf Tantalos. Several travellers in the 18th and 19th centuries described the work, including Richard Chandler, Charles Texier, Gustav Hirschfeld and Archibald Henry Sayce. \nThe interpretation of the figure is disputed. Bossert's identification with Cybele was rejected by Kurt Bittel as unsustainable, but he still saw a female goddess, as did Ekrem Akurgal. Peter Z. Spanos, however, interprets the figure as the Weather god, which conforms to the general tendency today to interpret the image as a male god; Ehringhaus suggests it is a mountain god.\n\nAs a result of confusion with a different natural rock formation near Manisa, which resembles a sitting figure and is known as \"Weeping Niobe\", this relief is sometimes, incorrectly, known as the \"Niobe cliffs\".\n\n\n"}

He went into the printing trade, and was a compositor for George Smeeton in 1812. He established himself as the country's leading reporter of sporting events, which at the time meant mainly prize-fights and horse-races.\n\nIt was Egan who first defined boxing as \"the sweet science\". He is buried in Highgate Cemetery, North London.\n\nFour volumes of \"Boxiana; or Sketches of Ancient and Modern Pugilism\" appeared, lavishly illustrated, between 1813 and 1824. Following a dispute with his publisher, Egan was replaced for the fourth \"Boxiana\" volume (replaced by 'Jon Bee'), the court permitting Egan continued rights to the title provided he used the \"New Series\" prefix. Two volumes of Egan's \"New Series Boxiana\" were published in 1828/29. In 1821 Egan announced the publication of a regular journal: \"Life in London\", appearing monthly at a shilling a time. It was to be illustrated by George Cruikshank (1792–1878), and was dedicated to the King, George IV, who at one time had received Egan at court. The first edition of \"Life in London or, the Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, esq., and his elegant friend, Corinthian Tom, accompanied by Bob Logic, the Oxonian, in their rambles and sprees through the Metropolis\" appeared on 15 July 1821.\n\nEgan's creation was an instant success. Pirate versions appeared, featuring such figures as 'Bob Tallyho', 'Dick Wildfire' and the like. Print-makers speedily knocked off cuts featuring the various 'stars' and the real-life public flocked to the 'sporting' addresses that Egan had his heroes frequent. There was a translation into French. At least six plays were based on Egan's characters, contributing to yet more sales. One of these was exported to America, launching the \"Tom and Jerry\" craze there. The version created by William Thomas Moncrieff was praised as \"The Beggar's Opera of its day\". Moncrieff's production of \"Tom and Jerry, or Life in London\" ran continuously at the Adelphi Theatre for two seasons and it was the dramatist's work as much as the author's that did so much to popularise the book's trademark use of fashionable slang. \"Life in London\" appeared until 1828, when Egan closed it down.\n\nEgan published a report of the trial of John Thurtell and Joseph Hunt, for the murder of William Weare. Thurtell allegedly mentioned, just seven hours before his execution, that among his final wishes was a desire to read Egan's coverage of a recent prizefight. Egan wrote also satirical legal pieces such as \"The Fancy Tog's Man versus Young Sadboy, the Milling Quaker\". In 1824 he launched a new journal, \"Pierce Egan's Life in London and Sporting Guide\", a weekly newspaper priced at eightpence-halfpenny. Other works included sporting anecdotes, theatrical autobiographies, guide-books, and 'fancy ditties'. Among his later efforts, in 1838, was a series of pieces on the delights to be found on and immediately adjacent to the Thames. It was dedicated, with permission, to the young Queen Victoria and featured the illustrative work of his son Pierce Egan the Younger.\n\nIn 1823 Egan produced an edition of Francis Grose's \"Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue\" (1785 et seq.), including mainly sporting Regency slang. He also cut the \"coarse\" and \"broad\" expressions' which Grose had allowed, and noted the way that some slang terminology, typically \"rum\" – once a positive term, but by 1820 generally the reverse – had altered. Don Atyeo wrote in his study of \"Violence in Sport\" (1979) that\n\n\"Boxiana\" is riddled with \"Fancy\" slang: '\"Ogles\" were blackened, \"peepers\" plunged into darkness, \"tripe-shops\" received \"staggerers\", \"ivories\" were cracked, \"domino boxes\" shattered, and \"claret\" flowed in a steady stream.\n\nAnd as Egan's character Corinthian Tom explains in \"Life in London\",\n\nA kind of \"cant\" phraseology is current from one end of the Metropolis to the other, and you will scarcely be able to move a single step, my dear JERRY, without consulting a \"Slang\" Dictionary, or having some friend at your elbow to explain the strange expressions which, at every turn, will assail your ear.' Such a dictionary is what Egan offers, hoping in sum that his efforts work 'to improve, and not to degrade mankind; to remove \"ignorance\", and put the UNWARY on their guard; to rouse the \"sleepy\", and to keep them AWAKE; to render those persons who are a little UP, more FLY: and to cause every one to be \"down\" to those tricks, manoeuvres and impositions practised in life, which daily cross the paths of both young and old.\n\nJohn Camden Hotten brought out a reprint of \"Life in London\" in 1869. \"Tom and Jerry\", the celebrated duo, have been perpetuated in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's cartoon cat and mouse, and as the male protagonists of the 1970s' BBC television sitcom \"The Good Life\".\n\nPierce Egan was one of the narrators of George MacDonald Fraser's book \"Black Ajax\", about Tom Molineaux and his quest for the heavyweight championship of England.

Originally a double portrait, it was later cut in two and sold off as separate pieces. It showed composer Frédéric Chopin (1810–49) playing piano while writer George Sand (1804–76) sits to his right, listening and sewing (a favorite activity of hers). The sitters were lovers at the time, and both were close friends of the artist. \n\nThe portrait remained in Delacroix's studio until his death. Shortly afterward, it was cut into two separate works, both of which are tightly focused. Chopin's portrait comprises only a head shot, while Sand's shows her upper body but is narrowly cut. This led to the loss of large areas of the original canvas. The reason for the divide is likely the then-owner's belief that two paintings would sell for a higher price than one. Today Chopin's portrait is housed at the Louvre in Paris, while Sand's hangs at Copenhagen's Ordrupgaard Museum.\n\nGeorge Sand was a French Romantic novelist, one of the first female French writers to establish an international reputation. She became known for behavior unusual for a woman at the time, including openly conducting affairs, smoking a pipe and wearing men's clothing. Sand had been a friend of Delacroix for a number of years, though the painter did not hold her work in high regard. She met Chopin in 1836 and from 1838 conducted a relationship with him for ten years, until two years before he died. Much of the composer's best work was done during those ten years. Though their relationship began as physical, Chopin's failing health (described in Sand's autobiographical \"Winter in \nMallorca\") in time changed her role to that of caregiver. \n\nSand introduced Delacroix to Chopin in 1838, and the two men remained close friends until the composer's death.\nThe double portrait showed Chopin playing piano while Sand sat and listened. Little is known of the painting's origin or the circumstances of its execution. It is not known whether it was a commission or intended as a gift to the composer. It is known that Delacroix borrowed a piano so that the work could be painted in his studio. The double portrait was not finished, and one of the elements that was not painted was the piano.\n\nThe Sand canvas is generally seen as the more interesting because, in its original form, it was intended as a counterpoint to the Chopin portrait, not as a stand-alone work. As such, it contravenes many conventions of portraiture. It was usual in 19th-century bust-sized paintings for the subject to be largely static, but here Sand is shown reacting to the music Chopin is playing, and highly animated and energetic in her emotional response. \n\n"}
{"id": "19834537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19834537", "title": "Portraiture of Elizabeth I of England", "text": "Portraiture of Elizabeth I of England\n\nThe portraiture of Elizabeth I of England illustrates the evolution of English royal portraits in the Early Modern period from the representations of simple likenesses to the later complex imagery used to convey the power and aspirations of the state, as well as of the monarch at its head.\n\nEven the earliest portraits of Elizabeth I (1533–1603) contain symbolic objects such as roses and prayer books that would have carried meaning to viewers of her day. Later portraits of Elizabeth layer the iconography of empire—globes, crowns, swords and columns—and representations of virginity and purity—such as moons and pearls—with classical allusions to present a complex \"story\" that conveyed to Elizabethan era viewers the majesty and significance of their Virgin Queen.\n\nTwo portraiture traditions had arisen in the Tudor court since the days of Elizabeth's father, Henry VIII. The portrait miniature developed from the illuminated manuscript tradition. These small personal images were almost invariably painted from life over the space of a few days in watercolours on vellum stiffened by being glued to a playing card. Panel paintings in oils on prepared wood surfaces were based on preparatory drawings and were usually executed at life size, as were oil paintings on canvas.\n\nUnlike her contemporaries in France, Elizabeth never granted rights to produce her portrait to a single artist, although Nicholas Hilliard was appointed her official limner or miniaturist and goldsmith. George Gower, a fashionable court portraitist created Serjeant Painter in 1581, was responsible for approving all portraits of the queen created by other artists from that date until his death in 1596. Elizabeth sat to a number of artists over the years, including Hilliard, Cornelis Ketel, Federico Zuccaro or Zuccari, Isaac Oliver, and most likely to Gower and Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.\n\nPortraits were commissioned by the government as gifts to foreign monarchs and to show to prospective suitors. Courtiers commissioned heavily symbolic paintings to demonstrate their devotion to the queen. The fashionable long galleries of later Elizabethan country houses were filled with sets of portraits. The studios of Tudor artists produced images of Elizabeth working from approved \"face patterns\" or drawings of the queen to meet this growing demand for her image, an important symbol of loyalty and reverence for the crown in times of turbulence.\n\nFar the most impressive models available to English portraitists were the many portraits by Hans Holbein the Younger, the outstanding Northern portraitist of the first half of the century, who had made two lengthy visits to England and been Henry VIII's court artist. Holbein had accustomed the English court to the full-length life-size portrait, although none of his originals now survive. His great dynastic mural at Whitehall Palace, destroyed in 1698, and perhaps other original large portraits, would have been familiar to Elizabethan artists.\n\nBoth Holbein and his great Italian contemporary Titian had combined great psychological penetration with a sufficiently majestic impression to satisfy their royal patrons. By his second visit Holbein was already moving away from a strictly realist depiction; in his \"Jane Seymour\" \"the figure is no longer seen as displacing with its bulk a recognizable section of space: it approaches rather to a flat pattern, made alive by a bounding and vital outline\". This tendency was to be taken much further by the later portraits of Elizabeth, where \"Likeness of feature and an interest in form and volume have gradually been abandoned in favour of an effect of splendid majesty obtained by decorative pattern, and the forms have been flattened accordingly\".\n\nTitian continued to paint royal portraits, especially of Philip II of Spain, until the 1570s, but in sharply reduced numbers after about 1555, and he refused to travel from Venice to do them. The full-length portrait of Philip (1550–51) now in the Prado was sent to Elizabeth's elder sister and predecessor Mary I in advance of their marriage.\n\nTowards the mid-century the most influential Continental courts came to prefer less revealing and intimate works, and at the mid-century the two most prominent and influential royal portraitists in paint, other than Titian, were the Netherlandish Anthonis Mor and Agnolo Bronzino in Florence, besides whom the Habsburg court sculptor and medallist Leone Leoni should also be mentioned. Mor, who had risen rapidly to prominence in 1540s, worked across Europe for the Habsburgs in a tighter and more rigid version of Titian's compositional manner, drawing also on the North Italian style of Moretto. Mor had actually visited London in 1554, and painted three versions of his well-known portrait of Queen Mary; he also painted English courtiers who visited Antwerp.\n\nMor's Spanish pupil Alonso Sánchez Coello continued in a stiffer version of his master's style, replacing him as Spanish court painter in 1561. Sofonisba Anguissola had painted in an intimately informal style, but after her recruitment to the Spanish court as the Queen's painter in 1560 was able to adapt her style to the much more formal demands of state portraiture. Moretto's pupil Giovanni Battista Moroni was Mor's contemporary and formed his mature style in the 1550s, but few of his spirited portraits were of royalty, or yet to be seen outside Italy.\n\nBronzino developed a style of coldly distant magnificence, based on the Mannerist portraits of Pontormo, working almost entirely for Cosimo I, the first Medici Grand-Duke. Bronzino's works, including his striking portraits of Cosimo's Duchess, Eleanor of Toledo were distributed in many versions across Europe, continuing to be made for two decades from the same studio pattern; a new portrait painted in her last years, about 1560, exists in only a few repetitions. At the least many of the foreign painters in London are likely to have seen versions of the earlier type, and there may well have been one in the Royal Collection.\n\nFrench portraiture remained dominated by small but finely drawn bust-length or half-length works, including many drawings, often with colour, by François Clouet following, with a host of imitators, his father Jean, or even smaller oils by the Netherlandish Corneille de Lyon and his followers, typically no taller than a paperback book. A few full-length portraits of royalty were produced, dependent on German or Italian models.\n\nWilliam Gaunt contrasts the simplicity of the 1546 portrait of \"Elizabeth Tudor as a Princess\" with later images of her as queen. He wrote, \"The painter...is unknown, but in a competently Flemish style he depicts the daughter of Anne Boleyn as quiet and studious-looking, ornament in her attire as secondary to the plainness of line that emphasizes her youth. Great is the contrast with the awesome fantasy of the later portraits: the pallid, mask-like features, the extravagance of headdress and ruff, the padded ornateness that seemed to exclude all humanity.\"\n\nThe lack of emphasis given to depicting depth and volume in her later portraits may have been influenced by the Queen's own views. In the \"Art of Limming\" Hilliard cautioned against all but the minimal use of chiaroscuro modelling that we see in his works, reflecting the views of his patron: \"seeing that best to show oneself needeth no shadow of place but rather the open light...Her Majesty..chose her place to sit for that purpose in the open alley of a goodly garden, where no tree was near, nor any shadow at all...\"\n\nFrom the 1570s, the government sought to manipulate the image of the queen as an object of devotion and veneration. Sir Roy Strong writes: \"The cult of Gloriana was skilfully created to buttress public order and, even more, deliberately to replace the pre-Reformation externals of religion, the cult of the Virgin and saints with their attendant images, processions, ceremonies and secular rejoicing.\" The pageantry of the Accession Day tilts, the poetry of the court, and the most iconic of Elizabeth's portraits all reflect this effort. The management of the queen's image reached its heights in the last decade of the reign, when realistic images of the aging queen were replaced with an eternally youthful vision defying the reality of the passage of time.\n\nPortraits of the young queen, many of them likely painted to be shown to prospective suitors and foreign heads of state, show a naturalness and restraint similar to those in the portrait of Elizabeth as a princess.\nThe full-length \"Hampden\" image of Elizabeth in a red satin gown by Steven van der Meulen has been identified by Sir Roy Strong as an important early portrait, \"undertaken at a time when her image was being tightly controlled. 'This is a portrait dating from the mid to late 1560s, one of a group produced in response to a crisis over the production of the royal image, one which was reflected in the words of a draft proclamation dated 1563,' he said.\" The draft proclamation (never published) was a response to the circulation of poorly made portraits in which Elizabeth is shown \"in blacke with a hoode and cornet\", a style she no longer wore. Symbolism in these pictures is in keeping with earlier Tudor portraiture; in some Elizabeth holds a book (possibly a prayer book) suggesting studiousness or piety. In other paintings she holds or wears a red rose, symbol of the Tudor Dynasty's descent from the House of Lancaster, or white roses, symbols of the House of York and of maidenly chastity. In the Hampden portrait, Elizabeth wears a red rose on her shoulder and holds a gillyflower in her hand. Of this image, Strong says \"'Here Elizabeth is caught in that short-lived period before what was a recognisable human became transmuted into a goddess'.\"\n\nOne artist active in Elizabeth's early court was the Flemish miniaturist Levina Teerlinc who had served as a painter and gentlewoman to Mary I and stayed on as a Gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber to Elizabeth. Teerlinc is best known for her pivotal position in the rise of the portrait miniature. There is documentation that she created numerous portraits of Elizabeth I, both individual portraits and portraits of the sovereign with important court figures, but only a few of these have survived and been identified.\n\n Two surviving allegorical paintings show the early use of classical mythology to illustrate the beauty and sovereignty of the young queen. In \"Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses\" (1569), attributed to Hans Eworth, the story of the Judgement of Paris is turned on its head. Elizabeth, rather than Paris, is now sent to choose among Juno, Venus, and Pallas-Minerva, all of whom are outshone by the queen with her crown and royal orb. As Susan Doran writes, \"Implicit to the theme of the painting ... is the idea that Elizabeth's retention of royal power benefits her realm. Whereas Paris's judgement in the original myth resulted in the long Trojan Wars 'to the utter ruin of the Trojans', hers will conversely bring peace and order to the state\" after the turbulent reign of Elizabeth's sister Mary I.\n\nThe latter theme lies behind the 1572 \"The Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession\" (attributed to Lucas de Heere). In this image, Catholic Mary and her husband Philip II of Spain are accompanied by Mars the god of War on the left, while Protestant Elizabeth on the right ushers in the goddesses Peace and Plenty. An inscription states that this painting was a gift from the queen to Francis Walsingham as a \"Mark of her people's and her own content\" and this may indicate that it commemorates the signing of the Treaty of Blois (1572) which established an alliance between England and France against Spanish aggression in the Netherlands during Walsingham's tour of duty as ambassador to the French court. Strong identifies both paintings as celebrations of Elizabeth's just rule by Flemish exiles to whom England was a refuge from the religious persecution of Protestants in the Spanish Netherlands.\n\nNicholas Hilliard was an apprentice to the Queen's jeweller Robert Brandon, a goldsmith and city chamberlain of London, and Sir Roy Strong suggests that Hilliard may also have been trained in the art of limning by Levina Teerlinc. Hilliard emerged from his apprenticeship at a time when a new royal portrait painter was \"desperately needed.\"\n\nHilliard's first known miniature of the Queen is dated 1572. It is not known when he was formally appointed limner (miniaturist) and goldsmith to Elizabeth, though he was granted the reversion of a lease by the Queen in 1573 for his \"good, true and loyal service.\" Two panel portraits long attributed to him, the \"Phoenix\" and \"Pelican\" portraits, are dated c. 1572–76. These paintings are named after the jewels the queen wears, her personal badges of the pelican in her piety and the phoenix. National Portrait Gallery researchers announced in September 2010 that the two portraits were painted on wood from the same two trees. They also found that a tracing of the Phoenix portrait matches the Pelican portrait in reverse. They therefore deduce that both pictures of Elizabeth in her forties were painted around the same time.\n\nBut Hilliard's panel portraits seem to have been found wanting, and in 1576 the recently married Hilliard left for France to improve his skills. Returning to England, he continued to work as a goldsmith, and produced some spectacular \"picture boxes\" or jewelled lockets for miniatures: the \"Armada Jewel\", given by Elizabeth to Sir Thomas Heneage and the \"Drake Pendant\" given to Sir Francis Drake are the best known examples. As part of the cult of the Virgin Queen, courtiers were rather expected to wear the Queen's likeness, at least at Court.\n\nHis appointment as miniaturist to the Crown included the old sense of a painter of illuminated manuscripts and he was commissioned to decorate important documents, such as the founding charter of Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1584), which has an enthroned Elizabeth under a canopy of estate within an elaborate framework of Flemish-style Renaissance strapwork and grotesque ornament. He also seems to have designed woodcut title-page frames and borders for books, some of which bear his initials.\n\nThe problem of an official portrait of Elizabeth was solved with the \"Darnley Portrait\". Likely painted from life around 1575–6, this portrait is the source of a face pattern which would be used and reused for authorized portraits of Elizabeth into the 1590s, preserving the impression of ageless beauty. Sir Roy Strong suggested that the artist is Federico Zuccari or Zucaro, an \"eminent\" Italian artist, though not really a specialist portrait-painter, who is known to have visited the court briefly with a letter of introduction to Elizabeth's favourite Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester dated 5 March 1575. Zuccaro's preparatory drawings for full-length portraits of both Leicester and Elizabeth survive, although it is unlikely the full-length of Elizabeth was ever painted. Curators at the National Portrait Gallery believe that the attribution of the Darnley portrait to Zuccaro is \"not sustainable\" and attribute the work to an unknown \"continental\" (possibly Netherlandish) artist.\n\nThe \"Darnley Portrait\" features a crown and sceptre on a table beside the queen, and was the first appearance of these symbols of sovereignty separately used as props (rather than worn and carried) in Tudor portraiture, a theme that would be expanded in later portraits. Recent conservation work has revealed that Elizabeth's now-iconic pale complexion in this portrait is the result of deterioration of red lake pigments, which has also altered the coloring of her dress.\n\nThe excommunication of Elizabeth by Pope Pius V in 1570 led to increased tension with Philip II of Spain, who championed the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, as the legitimate heir of his late wife Mary I. This tension played out over the next decades in the seas of the New World as well as in Europe, and culminated in the invasion attempt of the Spanish Armada.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that the first of a long series of portraits appears depicting Elizabeth with heavy symbolic overlays of imperial dominion based on mastery of the seas. Combined with a second layer of symbolism representing Elizabeth as the Virgin Queen, these new paintings signify the manipulation of Elizabeth's image as the destined Protestant protector of her people.\n\nStrong points out that there is no trace of this iconography in portraits of Elizabeth prior to 1579, and identifies its source as the conscious image-making of John Dee, whose 1577 \"General and Rare Memorials Pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation\" encouraged the establishment of a British Empire supported by a strong navy, asserting Elizabeth's claims to imperial status via her supposed descent from Brutus of Troy and King Arthur.\n\nDee's inspiration lies in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"History of the Kings of Britain\", which was accepted as true history by Elizabethan poets and formed the basis of the symbolic history of England. In this twelfth century pseudohistory, Britain was founded by and named after Brutus, the descendent of Aeneas who founded Rome. The Tudors, of Welsh descent, are heirs of the most ancient Britons and thus of Aeneas and Brutus. By uniting the Houses of York and Lancaster following the strife of the Wars of the Roses, the Tudors ushered in a united realm where \"Pax\" reigned. The Spenserian scholar Edwin Greenlaw states \"The descent of the Britons from the Trojans, the linking of Arthur, Henry VIII, and Elizabeth as Britain's greatest monarchs, and the return under Elizabeth of the Golden Age are all commonplaces of Elizabethan thought.\" This understanding of history and Elizabeth's place in it forms the background to the symbolic portraits of the latter half of her reign.\n\nA series of \"Sieve Portraits\" copy the \"Darnley\" face pattern and add an allegorical overlay that depicts Elizabeth as Tuccia, a Vestal Virgin who proved her chastity by carrying a sieve full of water from the Tiber River to the Temple of Vesta without spilling a drop. The first \"Sieve Portrait\" was painted by George Gower in 1579, but the most influential image is the 1583 version by Quentin Metsys (or Massys) the Younger.\nIn the Metsys version, Elizabeth is surrounded by symbols of empire, including a column and a globe, iconography that would appear again and again in her portraiture of the 1580s and 1590s, most notably in the \"Armada Portrait\" of c. 1588. The medallions on the pillar to the left of the queen illustrate the story of Dido and Aeneas, ancestor of Brutus, suggesting that like Aeneas, Elizabeth's destiny is to reject marriage and found an empire. This painting's patron was likely Sir Christopher Hatton (his heraldic badge of the white hind appears on the sleeve of one of the courtiers in the background), and the work may express opposition to the proposed marriage of Elizabeth to François, Duke of Anjou.\n\nThe virgin Tuccia was familiar to Elizabethan readers from Petrarch's \"The Triumph of Chastity\". Another symbol from this work is the spotless ermine, wearing a collar of gold studded with topazes. This symbol of purity appears in the \"Ermine Portrait\" of 1585, attributed to the herald William Segar. The queen bears the olive branch of \"Pax\" (Peace), and the sword of justice rests on the table at her side. In combination, these symbols represent not only the personal purity of Elizabeth but the \"righteousness and justice of her government.\"\nThe \"Armada Portrait\" is an allegorical panel painting depicting the queen surrounded by symbols of empire against a backdrop representing the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588.\n\nThere are three surviving versions of the portrait, in addition to several derivative paintings. The version at Woburn Abbey, the seat of the Dukes of Bedford, was long accepted as the work of George Gower, who had been appointed Serjeant Painter in 1581. A version in the National Portrait Gallery, London, which has been cut down at both sides leaving just a portrait of the queen, was also formerly attributed to Gower. A third version, owned by the Tyrwhitt-Drake family, may have been commissioned by Sir Francis Drake. Scholars agree that this version is by a different hand, noting distinctive techniques and approaches to the modelling of the queen's features. Curators now believe that the three extant versions are all the output of different workshops under the direction of unknown English artists.\n\nThe combination of a life-sized portrait of the queen with a horizontal format is \"quite unprecedented in her portraiture\", although allegorical portraits in a horizontal format, such as \"Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses\" and the \"Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession\" pre-date the \"Armada Portrait\".\n\nThe queen's hand rests on a globe below the crown of England, \"her fingers covering the Americas, indicating England's dominion of the seas and plans for imperialist expansion in the New World\". The Queen is flanked by two columns behind, probably a reference to the famous impresa of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, Philip II of Spain's father, which represented the pillars of Hercules, gateway to the Atlantic Ocean and the New World.\n\nIn the background view on the left, English fireships threaten the Spanish fleet, and on the right the ships are driven onto a rocky coast amid stormy seas by the \"Protestant Wind\". On a secondary level, these images show Elizabeth turning her back on storm and darkness while sunlight shines where she gazes.\n\nAn engraving by Crispijn van de Passe (Crispin van de Passe), published in 1596 but showing costume of the 1580s, carries similar iconography. Elizabeth stands between two columns bearing her arms and the Tudor heraldic badge of a portcullis. The columns are surmounted by her emblems of a pelican in her piety and a phoenix, and ships fill the sea behind her.\n\nThe various threads of mythology and symbolism that created the iconography of Elizabeth I combined into a tapestry of immense complexity in the years following the defeat of the Spanish Armada. In poetry, portraiture and pageantry, the queen was celebrated as Astraea, the just virgin, and simultaneously as Venus, the goddess of love. Another exaltation of the queen's virgin purity identified her with the moon goddess who holds dominion over the waters. Sir Walter Raleigh had begun to use Diana and later Cynthia as aliases for the queen in his poetry around 1580, and images of Elizabeth with jewels in the shape of crescent moons or the huntress's arrows begin to appear in portraiture around 1586 and multiply through the remainder of the reign. Courtiers wore the image of the Queen to signify their devotion, and had their portraits painted wearing her colours of black and white.\n\nThe \"Ditchley Portrait\" seems to have always been at the Oxfordshire home of Elizabeth's retired Champion, Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley, and likely was painted for (or commemorates) her two-day visit to Ditchley in 1592. The painting is attributed to Marcus Gheerearts the Younger, and was almost certainly based on a sitting arranged by Lee, who was the painter's patron. In this image, the queen stands on a map of England, her feet on Oxfordshire. The painting has been trimmed and the background poorly repainted, so that the inscription and sonnet are incomplete. Storms rage behind her while the sun shines before her, and she wears a jewel in the form of a celestial or armillary sphere close to her left ear. Many versions of this painting were made, likely in Gheeraerts' workshop, with the allegorical items removed and Elizabeth's features \"softened\" from the stark realism of her face in the original. One of these was sent as a diplomatic gift to the Grand Duke of Tuscany and is now in the Palazzo Pitti.\nAround 1592, the queen also sat to Isaac Oliver, a pupil of Hilliard, who produced an unfinished portrait miniature (left) used as a pattern for engravings of the queen. Only a single finished miniature from this pattern survives, with the queen's features softened, and Strong concludes that this realistic image from life of the aging Elizabeth was not deemed a success.\n\nPrior to the 1590s, woodcuts and engravings of the queen were created as book illustrations, but in this decade individual prints of the queen first appear, based on the Oliver face pattern. In 1596, the Privy Council ordered that unseemly portraits of the queen which had caused her \"great offence\" should be sought out and burnt, and Strong suggest that these prints, of which comparatively few survive, may be the offending images. Strong writes \"It must have been exposure to the searching realism of both Gheeraerts and Oliver that provoked the decision to suppress all likenesses of the queen that depicted her as being in any way old and hence subject to mortality.\"\n\nIn any event, no surviving portraits dated between 1596 and Elizabeth's death in 1603 show the aging queen as she truly was. Faithful resemblance to the original is only to be found in contemporaries’ accounts as in the report written in 1597 by André Hurault de Maisse, Ambassador Extraordinary from Henry IV of France, after an audience with the sixty-five year-old queen, during which he noticed, \"her teeth are very yellow and unequal […] and on the left side less than on the right. Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly.\" Yet he added, \"her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal.\" All subsequent images rely on a face pattern devised by Nicholas Hilliard sometime in the 1590s called by art historians the \"Mask of Youth\", portraying Elizabeth as ever-young. Some 16 miniatures by Hilliard and his studio are known based on this face pattern, with different combinations of costume and jewels likely painted from life, and it was also adopted by (or enforced on) other artists associated with the Court.\n\nTwo portraits of Elizabeth in her coronation robes survive, both dated to 1600 or shortly thereafter. One is a panel portrait in oils () and the other is a miniature by Nicholas Hilliard. The warrant to the queen's tailor for remodelling Mary I's cloth of gold coronation robes for Elizabeth survives, and costume historian Janet Arnold's study points out that the paintings accurately reflect the written records, although the jewels differ in the two paintings, suggesting two different sources, one possibly a miniature by Levina Teerlinc. It is not known why, and for whom, these portraits were created; at or just after the end of the reign.\n\nAttributed to Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, perhaps the most heavily symbolic portrait of the queen is the \"Rainbow Portrait\" at Hatfield House. It was painted around 1600–1602, when the queen was in her sixties. In this painting an ageless Elizabeth appears dressed as if for a masque, in a linen bodice embroidered with spring flowers and a mantle draped over one shoulder, her hair loose beneath a fantastical headdress. She wears symbols out of the popular emblem books, including the cloak with eyes and ears, the serpent of wisdom, and the celestial armillary sphere, and carries a rainbow with the motto \"non sine sol iris\" (\"no rainbow without the sun\"). Strong suggests that the complex \"programme\" for this image may be the work of the poet John Davies, whose \"Hymns to Astraea\" honouring the queen use much of the same imagery, and suggests it was commissioned by Robert Cecil as part of the decor for Elizabeth's visit in 1602, when a \"shrine to Astraea\" featured in the entertainments of what would prove to be the \"last great festival of the reign\".\n\nPrior to the wide dissemination of prints of the queen in the 1590s, the common people of Elizabeth's England would be most familiar with her image on the coinage. In December 1560, a systematic recoinage of the debased money then in circulation was begun. The main early effort was the issuance of sterling silver shillings and groats, but new coins were issued in both silver and gold. This restoration of the currency was one of the three principal achievements noted on Elizabeth's tomb, illustrating the value of stable currency to her contemporaries. Later coinage represented the queen in iconic fashion, with the traditional accompaniments of Tudor heraldic badges including the Tudor rose and portcullis.\n\nBooks provided another widely available source of images of Elizabeth. Her portrait appeared on the title page of the \"Bishops' Bible\", the standard Bible of the Church of England, issued in 1568 and revised in 1572. In various editions, Elizabeth is depicted with her orb and sceptre accompanied by female personifications.\n\nIt may be impossible for modern viewers to see the hundreds of images of Elizabeth as her subjects, courtiers, and rivals saw them. The portraits are steeped in classical mythology and the Renaissance understanding of English history and destiny, filtered by allusions to Petrarch's sonnets and, late in the reign, to Edmund Spenser's \"Faerie Queene\". Dame Frances Yates points out that the most complexly symbolic portraits may all commemorate specific events or have been designed as part of elaborate themed entertainments. The most familiar images of Elizabeth—the \"Armada\", \"Ditchley\", and \"Rainbow\" portraits—are all associated with unique events in this way. To the extent that the contexts of other portraits have been lost to scholars, so too the keys to understanding these remarkable images as the Elizabethans understood them may be lost in time. Even those portraits that are not overtly allegorical may be full of meaning to a discerning eye. Elizabethan courtiers familiar with the language of flowers and the Italian emblem books could have read stories in the blooms the queen carried, the embroidery on her clothes, and the design of her jewels.\n\nAccording to Roy Strong, Fear of the wrong use and perception of the visual image dominates the Elizabethan age. The old pre-Reformation idea of images, religious ones, was that they partook of the essence of what they depicted. Any advance in technique which could reinforce that experience was embraced. That was now reversed, indeed it may account for the Elizabethans failing to take cognisance of the optical advances which created the art of the Italian Renaissance. They certainly knew about these things but, and this is central to the understanding of the Elizabethans, chose not to employ them. Instead the visual arts retreated in favour of presenting a series of signs or symbols through which the viewer was meant to pass to an understanding of the idea behind the work. In this manner the visual arts were verbalised, turned into a form of book, a 'text' which called for reading by the onlooker. There are no better examples of this than the quite extraordinary portraits of the queen herself, which increasingly, as the reign progressed, took on the form of collections of abstract pattern and symbols disposed in an unnaturalistic manner for the viewer to unravel, and by doing so enter into an inner vision of the idea of monarchy.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23603", "title": "Postmodernism", "text": "Postmodernism\n\nPostmodernism is a broad movement that developed in the mid- to late-20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture, and criticism and that marked a departure from modernism. The term has also more generally been applied to the historical era following modernity and the tendencies of this era. (In this context, \"modern\" is not used in the sense of \"contemporary\", but merely as a name for a specific period in history.)\nWhile encompassing a wide variety of approaches, postmodernism is generally defined by an attitude of skepticism, irony, or rejection toward the meta-narratives and ideologies of modernism, often calling into question various assumptions of Enlightenment rationality. Consequently, common targets of postmodern critique include universalist notions of objective reality, morality, truth, human nature, reason, language, and social progress. Postmodern thinkers frequently call attention to the contingent or socially-conditioned nature of knowledge claims and value systems, situating them as products of particular political, historical, or cultural discourses and hierarchies. Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to self-referentiality, epistemological and moral relativism, pluralism, subjectivism, and irreverence.\n\nPostmodern critical approaches gained purchase in the 1980s and 1990s, and have been adopted in a variety of academic and theoretical disciplines, including cultural studies, philosophy of science, economics, linguistics, architecture, feminist theory, and literary criticism, as well as art movements in fields such as literature and music. Postmodernism is often associated with schools of thought such as deconstruction and post-structuralism, as well as philosophers such as Jean-François Lyotard, Jacques Derrida, and Fredric Jameson. Some philosophers have criticized the term.\n\nPostmodernism arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with totalitarianism or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what is now called postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of artists such as Jorge Luis Borges. However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s. Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and continental philosophy.\n\nSalient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels, a metaphysical skepticism or nihilism towards a \"grand narrative\" of Western culture, a preference for the virtual at the expense of the Real (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes) and a \"waning of affect\" on the part of the subject, who is caught up in the free interplay of virtual, endlessly reproducible signs inducing a state of consciousness similar to schizophrenia.\n\nSince the late 1990s there has been a small but growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism \"has gone out of fashion\".\n\nStructuralism was a philosophical movement developed by French academics in the 1950s, partly in response to French Existentialism. It has been seen variously as an expression of Modernism, High modernism, or postmodernism . \"Post-structuralists\" were thinkers who moved away from the strict interpretations and applications of structuralist ideas. Many American academics consider post-structuralism to be part of the broader, less well-defined postmodernist movement, even though many post-structuralists insisted it was not. Thinkers who have been called structuralists include the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, and the semiotician Algirdas Greimas. The early writings of the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and the literary theorist Roland Barthes have also been called structuralists. Those who began as structuralists but became post-structuralists include Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze. Other post-structuralists include Jacques Derrida, Pierre Bourdieu, Jean-François Lyotard, Julia Kristeva, Hélène Cixous, and Luce Irigaray. The American cultural theorists, critics and intellectuals whom they influenced include Judith Butler, John Fiske, Rosalind Krauss, Avital Ronell, and Hayden White.\n\nPost-structuralism is not defined by a set of shared axioms or methodologies, but by an emphasis on how various aspects of a particular culture, from its most ordinary, everyday material details to its most abstract theories and beliefs, determine one another. Post-structuralist thinkers reject Reductionism and Epiphenomenalism and the idea that cause-and-effect relationships are top-down or bottom-up. Like structuralists, they start from the assumption that people's identities, values and economic conditions determine each other rather than having \"intrinsic\" properties that can be understood in isolation. Thus the French structuralists considered themselves to be espousing Relativism and Constructionism. But they nevertheless tended to explore how the subjects of their study might be described, reductively, as a set of \"essential\" relationships, schematics, or mathematical symbols. (An example is Claude Lévi-Strauss's algebraic formulation of mythological transformation in \"The Structural Study of Myth\"). Post-structuralists thinkers went further, questioning the existence of any distinction between the nature of a thing and its relationship to other things.\n\nPostmodernist ideas in philosophy and the analysis of culture and society expanded the importance of critical theory and has been the point of departure for works of literature, architecture, and design, as well as being visible in marketing/business and the interpretation of history, law and culture, starting in the late 20th century. These developments—re-evaluation of the entire Western value system (love, marriage, popular culture, shift from industrial to service economy) that took place since the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in the Social Revolution of 1968—are described with the term \"postmodernity\", as opposed to \"Postmodernism\", a term referring to an opinion or movement. Postmodernism has also been used interchangeably with the term post-structuralism out of which postmodernism grew; a proper understanding of postmodernism or doing justice to the postmodernist concept demands an understanding of the post-structuralist movement and the ideas of its advocates. Post-structuralism resulted similarly to postmodernism by following a time of structuralism. It is characterized by new ways of thinking through structuralism, contrary to the original form. \"Postmodernist\" describes part of a movement; \"Postmodern\" places it in the period of time since the 1950s, making it a part of contemporary history.\n\nOne of the most well-known postmodernist concerns is \"deconstruction,\" a theory for philosophy, literary criticism, and textual analysis developed by Jacques Derrida. The notion of a \"deconstructive\" approach implies an analysis that questions the already evident understanding of a text in terms of presuppositions, ideological underpinnings, hierarchical values, and frames of reference. A deconstructive approach further depends on the techniques of close reading without reference to cultural, ideological, moral opinions or information derived from an authority over the text such as the author. At the same time Derrida famously writes: \"Il n'y a pas d'hors-texte (\"there is no such thing as outside-of-the-text\").\" Derrida implies that the world follows the grammar of a text undergoing its own deconstruction. Derrida's method frequently involves recognizing and spelling out the different, yet similar interpretations of the meaning of a given text and the problematic implications of binary oppositions within the meaning of a text. Derrida's philosophy inspired a postmodern movement called deconstructivism among architects, characterized by the intentional fragmentation, distortion, and dislocation of architectural elements in designing a building. Derrida discontinued his involvement with the movement after the publication of his collaborative project with architect Peter Eisenman in \"Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman\".\n\nThe connection between postmodernism, posthumanism, and cyborgism has led to a challenge of postmodernism, for which the terms \"postpostmodernism\" and \"postpoststructuralism\" were first coined in 2003:\n\nMore recently metamodernism, post-postmodernism and the \"death of postmodernism\" have been widely debated: in 2007 Andrew Hoberek noted in his introduction to a special issue of the journal \"Twentieth Century Literature\" titled \"After Postmodernism\" that \"declarations of postmodernism's demise have become a critical commonplace\". A small group of critics has put forth a range of theories that aim to describe culture or society in the alleged aftermath of postmodernism, most notably Raoul Eshelman (performatism), Gilles Lipovetsky (hypermodernity), Nicolas Bourriaud (altermodern), and Alan Kirby (digimodernism, formerly called pseudo-modernism). None of these new theories and labels have so far gained very widespread acceptance. Sociocultural anthropologist Nina Müller-Schwarze offers neostructuralism as a possible direction. The exhibition \"Postmodernism – Style and Subversion 1970–1990\" at the Victoria and Albert Museum (London, 24 September 2011 – 15 January 2012) was billed as the first show to document postmodernism as a historical movement.\n\nThe term \"postmodern\" was first used around the 1880s. John Watkins Chapman suggested \"a Postmodern style of painting\" as a way to depart from French Impressionism. J. M. Thompson, in his 1914 article in \"The Hibbert Journal\" (a quarterly philosophical review), used it to describe changes in attitudes and beliefs in the critique of religion, writing: \"The raison d'être of Post-Modernism is to escape from the double-mindedness of Modernism by being thorough in its criticism by extending it to religion as well as theology, to Catholic feeling as well as to Catholic tradition.\"\n\nIn 1921 and 1925, postmodernism had been used to describe new forms of art and music. In 1942 H. R. Hays described it as a new literary form. However, as a general theory for a historical movement it was first used in 1939 by Arnold J. Toynbee: \"Our own Post-Modern Age has been inaugurated by the general war of 1914–1918\".\n\nIn 1949 the term was used to describe a dissatisfaction with modern architecture, and led to the postmodern architecture movement, and a response to the modernist architectural movement known as the International Style. Postmodernism in architecture was initially marked by a re-emergence of surface ornament, reference to surrounding buildings in urban settings, historical reference in decorative forms (eclecticism), and non-orthogonal angles.\n\nPeter Drucker suggested the transformation into a post-modern world happened between 1937 and 1957 (when he was writing). He described an as yet \"nameless era\" which he characterized as a shift to conceptual world based on pattern, purpose, and process rather than mechanical cause, outlined by four new realities: the emergence of Educated Society, the importance of international development, the decline of the nation state, and the collapse of the viability of non-Western cultures.\n\nIn 1971, in a lecture delivered at the Institute of Contemporary Art, London, Mel Bochner described \"post-modernism\" in art as having started with Jasper Johns, \"who first rejected sense-data and the singular point-of-view as the basis for his art, and treated art as a critical investigation\".\n\nIn 1996, Walter Truett Anderson described postmodernism as belonging to one of four typological world views, which he identifies as either (a) Postmodern-ironist, which sees truth as socially constructed, (b) Scientific-rational, in which truth is found through methodical, disciplined inquiry, (c) Social-traditional, in which truth is found in the heritage of American and Western civilization, or (d) Neo-Romantic, in which truth is found through attaining harmony with nature and/or spiritual exploration of the inner self.\n\nMartin Heidegger rejected the philosophical basis of the concepts of \"subjectivity\" and \"objectivity\" and asserted that similar grounding oppositions in logic ultimately refer to one another. Instead of resisting the admission of this paradox in the search for understanding, Heidegger requires that we embrace it through an active process of elucidation he called the \"hermeneutic circle\". He stressed the historicity and cultural construction of concepts while simultaneously advocating the necessity of an atemporal and immanent apprehension of them. In this vein, he asserted that it was the task of contemporary philosophy to recover the original question of (or \"openness to\") \"Dasein\" (translated as Being or Being-there) present in the Presocratic philosophers but normalized, neutered, and standardized since Plato. This was to be done, in part, by tracing the record of \"Dasein's\" sublimation or forgetfulness through the history of philosophy which meant that we were to ask again what constituted the grounding conditions in ourselves and in the World for the affinity between beings and between the many usages of the term \"being\" in philosophy. To do this, however, a non-historical and, to a degree, self-referential engagement with whatever set of ideas, feelings or practices would permit (both the non-fixed concept and reality of) such a continuity was required—a continuity permitting the possible experience, possible existence indeed not only of beings but of all differences as they appeared and tended to develop.\n\nSuch a conclusion led Heidegger to depart from the phenomenology of his teacher Husserl and prompt instead an (ironically anachronistic) return to the yet-unasked questions of Ontology, a return that in general did not acknowledge an intrinsic distinction between phenomena and noumena or between things in themselves (\"de re\") and things as they appear (see qualia): Being-in-the-world, or rather, the openness to the process of \"Dasein\"'s becoming was to bridge the age-old gap between these two. In this latter premise, Heidegger shares an affinity with the late Romantic philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, another principal forerunner of post-structuralist and postmodernist thought. Influential to thinkers associated with Postmodernism are Heidegger's critique of the subject–object or sense–knowledge division implicit in Rationalism, Empiricism, and methodological naturalism, his repudiation of the idea that facts exist outside or separately from the process of thinking and speaking them (however, Heidegger is not specifically a nominalist), his related admission that the possibilities of philosophical and scientific discourse are wrapped up in the practices and expectations of a society and that concepts and fundamental constructs are the expression of a lived, historical exercise rather than simple derivations of external, \"a priori\" conditions independent from historical mind and changing experience (see Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Heinrich von Kleist, Weltanschauung, and social constructionism), and his instrumentalist and negativist notion that Being (and, by extension, reality) is an action, method, tendency, possibility, and question rather than a discrete, positive, identifiable state, answer, or entity (see also process philosophy, dynamism, Instrumentalism, Pragmatism, and Vitalism).\n\nJacques Derrida re-examined the fundamentals of writing and its consequences on philosophy in general; sought to undermine the language of \"presence\" or metaphysics in an analytical technique which, beginning as a point of departure from Heidegger's notion of \"Destruktion\", came to be known as Deconstruction. Derrida used, like Heidegger, references to Greek philosophical notions associated with the Skeptics and the Presocratics, such as Epoché and Aporia to articulate his notion of implicit circularity between premises and conclusions, origins and manifestations, but—in a manner analogous in certain respects to Gilles Deleuze—presented a radical re-reading of canonical philosophical figures such as Plato, Aristotle, and Descartes as themselves being informed by such \"destabilizing\" notions.\n\nMichel Foucault introduced concepts such as 'discursive regime', or re-invoked those of older philosophers like 'episteme' and 'genealogy' in order to explain the relationship between meaning, power, and social behavior within social orders (see \"The Order of Things\", \"The Archaeology of Knowledge\", \"Discipline and Punish\", and \"The History of Sexuality\"). In direct contradiction to what have been typified as modernist perspectives on epistemology, Foucault asserted that rational judgment, social practice, and what he called \"biopower\" are not only inseparable but co-determinant. While Foucault himself was deeply involved in a number of progressive political causes and maintained close personal ties with members of the far-left, he was also controversial with leftist thinkers of his day, including those associated with various Marxist tendencies, proponents of left-libertarianism (such as Noam Chomsky), and supporters of humanism (like Jürgen Habermas), for his rejection of what he deemed to be Enlightenment concepts of freedom, liberation, self-determination, and human nature. Instead, Foucault focused on the ways in which such constructs can foster cultural hegemony, violence, and exclusion.\n\nIn line with his rejection of such \"positive\" tenets of Enlightenment-era humanism, he was active—with Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari—in the anti-psychiatry movement, considering much of institutionalized psychiatry and, in particular, Freud's concept of repression central to Psychoanalysis (which was still very influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s), to be both harmful and misplaced. Foucault was known for his controversial aphorisms, such as \"language is oppression\", meaning that language functions in such a way as to render nonsensical, false, or silent tendencies that might otherwise threaten or undermine the distributions of power backing a society's conventions—even when such distributions purport to celebrate liberation and expression or value minority groups and perspectives. His writings have had a major influence on the larger body of postmodern academic literature.\n\nJean-François Lyotard identified in \"The Postmodern Condition\" a crisis in the \"discourses of the human sciences\" latent in modernism but catapulted to the fore by the advent of the \"computerized\" or \"telematic\" era (see information revolution). This crisis, insofar as it pertains to academia, concerns both the motivations and justification procedures for making research claims: unstated givens or values that have validated the basic efforts of academic research since the late 18th century might no longer be valid—particularly, in social science and humanities research, though examples from mathematics are given by Lyotard as well. As formal conjecture about real-world issues becomes inextricably linked to automated calculation, information storage, and retrieval, such knowledge becomes increasingly \"exteriorised\" from its knowers in the form of information. Knowledge thus becomes materialized and made into a commodity exchanged between producers and consumers; it ceases to be either an idealistic end-in-itself or a tool capable of bringing about liberty or social benefit; it is stripped of its humanistic and spiritual associations, its connection with education, teaching, and human development, being simply rendered as \"data\"—omnipresent, material, unending, and without any contexts or pre-requisites. Furthermore, the \"diversity\" of claims made by various disciplines begins to lack any unifying principle or intuition as objects of study become more and more specialized due to the emphasis on specificity, precision, and uniformity of reference that competitive, database-oriented research implies.\n\nThe value-premises upholding academic research have been maintained by what Lyotard considers to be quasi-mythological beliefs about human purpose, human reason, and human progress—large, background constructs he calls \"metanarratives\". These metanarratives still remain in Western society but are now being undermined by rapid Informatization and the commercialization of the university and its functions. The shift of authority from the presence and intuition of knowers—from the good faith of reason to seek diverse knowledge integrated for human benefit or truth fidelity—to the automated database and the market had, in Lyotard's view, the power to unravel the very idea of \"justification\" or \"legitimation\" and, with it, the rationale for research altogether, especially in disciplines pertaining to human life, society, and meaning. We are now controlled not by binding extra-linguistic value paradigms defining notions of collective identity and ultimate purpose, but rather by our automatic responses to different species of \"language games\" (a concept Lyotard imports from J. L. Austin's theory of speech acts). In his vision of a solution to this \"vertigo\", Lyotard opposes the assumptions of universality, consensus, and generality that he identified within the thought of humanistic, Neo-Kantian philosophers like Jürgen Habermas, and proposes a continuation of experimentation and diversity to be assessed pragmatically in the context of language games rather than via appeal to a resurrected series of transcendentals and metaphysical unities.\n\nRichard Rorty argues in \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\" that contemporary analytic philosophy mistakenly imitates scientific methods. In addition, he denounces the traditional epistemological perspectives of representationalism and correspondence theory that rely upon the independence of knowers and observers from phenomena and the passivity of natural phenomena in relation to consciousness. As a proponent of anti-foundationalism and anti-essentialism within a pragmatist framework, he echoes the postmodern strain of conventionalism and relativism, but opposes much of postmodern thinking with his commitment to social liberalism.\n\nJean Baudrillard, in \"Simulacra and Simulation\", introduced the concept that reality or the principle of \"The Real\" is short-circuited by the interchangeability of signs in an era whose communicative and semantic acts are dominated by electronic media and digital technologies. Baudrillard proposes the notion that, in such a state, where subjects are detached from the outcomes of events (political, literary, artistic, personal, or otherwise), events no longer hold any particular sway on the subject nor have any identifiable context; they therefore have the effect of producing widespread indifference, detachment, and passivity in industrialized populations. He claimed that a constant stream of appearances and references without any direct consequences to viewers or readers could eventually render the division between appearance and object indiscernible, resulting, ironically, in the \"disappearance\" of mankind in what is, in effect, a virtual or holographic state, composed only of appearances. For Baudrillard, \"simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or a reality: a hyperreal.\"\n\nFredric Jameson set forth one of the first expansive theoretical treatments of postmodernism as a historical period, intellectual trend, and social phenomenon in a series of lectures at the Whitney Museum, later expanded as \"Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism\" (1991). Eclectic in his methodology, Jameson has continued a sustained examination of the role that periodization continues to play as a grounding assumption of critical methodologies in humanities disciplines. He has contributed extensive effort to explicating the importance of concepts of Utopia and Utopianism as driving forces in the cultural and intellectual movements of modernity, and outlining the political and existential uncertainties that may result from the decline or suspension of this trend in the theorized state of postmodernity. Like Susan Sontag, Jameson served to introduce a wide audience of American readers to key figures of the 20th century continental European intellectual left, particularly those associated with the Frankfurt School, structuralism, and post-structuralism. Thus, his importance as a \"translator\" of their ideas to the common vocabularies of a variety of disciplines in the Anglo-American academic complex is equally as important as his own critical engagement with them.\n\nIn \"Analysis of the Journey\", a journal birthed from postmodernism, Douglas Kellner insists that the \"assumptions and procedures of modern theory\" must be forgotten. His terms defined in the depth of postmodernism are based on advancement, innovation, and adaptation. Extensively, Kellner analyzes the terms of this theory in real-life experiences and examples. Kellner used science and technology studies as a major part of his analysis; he urged that the theory is incomplete without it. The scale was larger than just postmodernism alone; it must be interpreted through cultural studies where science and technology studies play a huge role. The reality of the September 11 attacks on the United States of America is the catalyst for his explanation. This catalyst is used as a great representation due to the mere fact of the planned ambush and destruction of \"symbols of globalization\", insinuating the World Trade Center.\n\nThe conclusion he depicts is simple: postmodernism, as most use it today, will decide what experiences and signs in one's reality will be one's reality as they know it.\n\nThe idea of Postmodernism in architecture began as a response to the perceived blandness and failed Utopianism of the Modern movement. Modern Architecture, as established and developed by Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier, was focused on the pursuit of a perceived ideal perfection, and attempted harmony of form and function, and dismissal of \"frivolous ornament,\" as well as arguing for an architecture that represented the spirit of the age as depicted in cutting-edge technology, be it airplanes, cars, ocean liners or even supposedly artless grain silos. Critics of modernism argued that the attributes of perfection and minimalism themselves were subjective, and pointed out anachronisms in modern thought and questioned the benefits of its philosophy. Definitive postmodern architecture such as the work of Michael Graves and Robert Venturi rejects the notion of a 'pure' form or 'perfect' architectonic detail, instead conspicuously drawing from all methods, materials, forms and colors available to architects.\n\nModernist Ludwig Mies van der Rohe is associated with the phrase \"less is more\"; in response Venturi famously said, \"Less is a bore.\" \n\nThe intellectual scholarship regarding postmodernism and architecture is closely linked with the writings of critic-turned-architect Charles Jencks, beginning with lectures in the early 1970s and his essay \"The rise of post-modern architecture\" from 1975. His \"magnum opus\", however, is the book \"The Language of Post-Modern Architecture\", first published in 1977, and since running to seven editions. Jencks makes the point that Post-Modernism (like Modernism) varies for each field of art, and that for architecture it is not just a reaction to Modernism but what he terms \"double coding\": \"Double Coding: the combination of Modern techniques with something else (usually traditional building) in order for architecture to communicate with the public and a concerned minority, usually other architects.\" Furthermore, Post-Modern architects would for economic reasons be compelled to make use of contemporary technology, hence distinguishing such architects from mere revivalists. Among the Post-Modern architects championed by Jencks were Robert Venturi, Robert Stern, Charles Moore, Michael Graves, Leon Krier, and James Stirling.\n\nPostmodernism is a rejection of 'totality', of the notion that planning could be 'comprehensive', widely applied regardless of context, and rational. In this sense, Postmodernism is a rejection of its predecessor: Modernism. From the 1920s onwards, the Modern movement sought to design and plan cities which followed the logic of the new model of industrial mass production; reverting to large-scale solutions, aesthetic standardisation and prefabricated design solutions (Goodchild 1990). Postmodernism also brought a break from the notion that planning and architecture could result in social reform, which was an integral dimension of the plans of Modernism (Simonsen 1990). Furthermore, Modernism eroded urban living by its failure to recognise differences and aim towards homogenous landscapes (Simonsen 1990, 57). Within Modernism, urban planning represented a 20th-century move towards establishing something stable, structured, and rationalised within what had become a world of chaos, flux and change (Irving 1993, 475). The role of planners predating Postmodernism was one of the 'qualified professional' who believed they could find and implement one single 'right way' of planning new urban establishments (Irving 1993). In fact, after 1945, urban planning became one of the methods through which capitalism could be managed and the interests of developers and corporations could be administered (Irving 1993, 479).\n\nConsidering Modernism inclined urban planning to treat buildings and developments as isolated, unrelated parts of the overall urban ecosystems created fragmented, isolated, and homogeneous urban landscapes (Goodchild, 1990). One of the greater problems with Modernist-style of planning was the disregard of resident or public opinion, which resulted in planning being forced upon the majority by a minority consisting of affluent professionals with little to no knowledge of real 'urban' problems characteristic of post-Second World War urban environments: slums, overcrowding, deteriorated infrastructure, pollution and disease, among others (Irving 1993). These were precisely the 'urban ills' Modernism was meant to 'solve', but more often than not, the types of 'comprehensive', 'one size fits all' approaches to planning made things worse., and residents began to show interest in becoming involved in decisions which had once been solely entrusted to professionals of the built environment. Advocacy planning and participatory models of planning emerged in the 1960s to counter these traditional elitist and technocratic approaches to urban planning (Irving 1993; Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007). Furthermore, an assessment of the 'ills' of Modernism among planners during the 1960s, fuelled development of a participatory model that aimed to expand the range of participants in urban interventions (Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007, 21).\n\nJane Jacobs' 1961 book \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" was a sustained critique of urban planning as it had developed within Modernism and marked a transition from modernity to postmodernity in thinking about urban planning (Irving 1993, 479). However, the transition from Modernism to Postmodernism is often said to have happened at 3:32pm on 15 July in 1972, when Pruitt Igoe; a housing development for low-income people in St. Louis designed by architect Minoru Yamasaki, which had been a prize-winning version of Le Corbusier's 'machine for modern living' was deemed uninhabitable and was torn down (Irving 1993, 480). Since then, Postmodernism has involved theories that embrace and aim to create diversity, and it exalts uncertainty, flexibility and change (Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007). Postmodern planning aims to accept pluralism and heighten awareness of social differences in order to accept and bring to light the claims of minority and disadvantaged groups (Goodchild 1990). Urban planning discourse within Modernity and Postmodernity has developed in different contexts, even though they both grew within a capitalist culture. Modernity was shaped by a capitalist ethic of Fordist-Keynesian paradigm of mass, standardized production and consumption, while postmodernity was created out of a more flexible form of capital accumulation, labor markets and organisations (Irving 1993, 60). Also, there is a distinction between a postmodernism of 'reaction' and one of 'resistance'. A postmodernism of 'reaction' rejects Modernism and seeks to return to the lost traditions and history in order to create a new cultural synthesis, while Postmodernity of 'resistance' seeks to deconstruct Modernism and is a critique of the origins without necessarily returning to them (Irving 1993, 60). As a result of Postmodernism, planners are much less inclined to lay a firm or steady claim to there being one single 'right way' of engaging in urban planning and are more open to different styles and ideas of 'how to plan' (Irving 474).\n\nLiterary postmodernism was officially inaugurated in the United States with the first issue of \"boundary 2\", subtitled \"Journal of Postmodern Literature and Culture\", which appeared in 1972. David Antin, Charles Olson, John Cage, and the Black Mountain College school of poetry and the arts were integral figures in the intellectual and artistic exposition of postmodernism at the time. \"boundary 2\" remains an influential journal in postmodernist circles today.\n\nJorge Luis Borges' (1939) short story \"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote\", is often considered as predicting postmodernism and conceiving the ideal of the ultimate parody. Samuel Beckett is sometimes seen as an important precursor and influence. Novelists who are commonly connected with postmodern literature include Vladimir Nabokov, William Gaddis, Umberto Eco, John Hawkes, William S. Burroughs, Giannina Braschi, Kurt Vonnegut, John Barth, Jean Rhys, Donald Barthelme, E.L. Doctorow, Richard Kalich, Jerzy Kosinski, Don DeLillo, Thomas Pynchon (Pynchon's work has also been described as \"high modern\"), Ishmael Reed, Kathy Acker, Ana Lydia Vega, Jachym Topol and Paul Auster.\n\nIn 1971, the Arab-American scholar Ihab Hassan published \"The Dismemberment of Orpheus: Toward a Postmodern Literature,\" an early work of literary criticism from a postmodern perspective, in which the author traces the development of what he calls \"literature of silence\" through Marquis de Sade, Franz Kafka, Ernest Hemingway, Beckett, and many others, including developments such as the Theatre of the Absurd and the nouveau roman. In 'Postmodernist Fiction' (1987), Brian McHale details the shift from modernism to postmodernism, arguing that the former is characterized by an epistemological dominant, and that postmodern works have developed out of modernism and are primarily concerned with questions of ontology. In \"Constructing Postmodernism\" (1992), McHale's second book, he provides readings of postmodern fiction and of some of the contemporary writers who go under the label of cyberpunk. McHale's \"What Was Postmodernism?\" (2007), follows Raymond Federman's lead in now using the past tense when discussing postmodernism.\n\nPostmodern music is either music of the postmodern era, or music that follows aesthetic and philosophical trends of postmodernism. As the name suggests, the postmodernist movement formed partly in reaction to the ideals of the modernist. Because of this, postmodern music is mostly defined in opposition to modernist music, and a work can either be modernist, or postmodern, but not both. Jonathan Kramer posits the idea (following Umberto Eco and Jean-François Lyotard) that postmodernism (including \"musical\" postmodernism) is less a surface style or historical period (i.e., condition) than an \"attitude\".\n\nThe postmodern impulse in classical music arose in the 1960s with the advent of musical minimalism. Composers such as Terry Riley, Henryk Górecki, Bradley Joseph, John Adams, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Michael Nyman, and Lou Harrison reacted to the perceived elitism and dissonant sound of atonal academic modernism by producing music with simple textures and relatively consonant harmonies, whilst others, most notably John Cage challenged the prevailing narratives of beauty and objectivity common to Modernism. Some composers have been openly influenced by popular music and world ethnic musical traditions.\n\nPostmodern classical music as well is not a musical \"style\", but rather refers to music of the postmodern era. It bears the same relationship to postmodernist music that postmodernity bears to postmodernism. Postmodern music, on the other hand, shares characteristics with postmodernist art—that is, art that comes \"after\" and reacts \"against\" modernism.\n\nThough representing a general return to certain notions of music-making that are often considered to be classical or romantic, not all postmodern composers have eschewed the experimentalist or academic tenets of modernism. The works of Dutch composer Louis Andriessen, for example, exhibit experimentalist preoccupation that is decidedly anti-romantic. Eclecticism and freedom of expression, in reaction to the rigidity and aesthetic limitations of modernism, are the hallmarks of the postmodern influence in musical composition.\n\nAuthor on postmodernism, Dominic Strinati, has noted, it is also important \"to include in this category the so-called 'art rock' musical innovations and mixing of styles associated with groups like Talking Heads, and performers like Laurie Anderson, together with the self-conscious 'reinvention of disco' by the Pet Shop Boys\".\n\nGraphic design in the postmodern age brought forth ideas that challenged the orderly feel of modernism. Graphic designers created works beginning in the 1970s without any set adherence to rational order and formal organization. Designers began experimenting with how shapes, forms and typography could react with one another effectively and interestingly in a less rigid way even if the design was rendered illegible. Some graphic design styles that emerged in the postmodernist era were New Wave Typography, retro and vernacular design, playful design inspired by the Italian Memphis Group, punk rock styles and explorative digital design from the late 1980's. Another characteristic of postmodern graphic design is that \"retro, techno, punk, grunge, beach, parody, and pastiche were all conspicuous trends. Each had its own sites and venues, detractors and advocates\".\n\nYet, while postmodern design did not consist of one unified graphic style, the movement was an expressive and playful time for designers who searched for more and more ways to go against the system. Postmodernism did not seek rules but only creative solutions and innovative ideas. The clean orderly grid-based designs of International Typographic Style were interrupted for more exploration and innovation in color, composition, visual communication, and typography. Key influential postmodern graphic designers include Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman, Jayme Odgers, Tibor Kalman, Dan Friedman, Paula Scher, Neville Brody, Michael Vanderbyl and Jamie Reid.\n\nCriticisms of postmodernism are intellectually diverse, including the assertions that postmodernism is meaningless and promotes obscurantism. For example, Noam Chomsky has argued that postmodernism is meaningless because it adds nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge. He asks why postmodernist intellectuals do not respond like people in other fields when asked, \"what are the principles of their theories, on what evidence are they based, what do they explain that wasn't already obvious, etc.?...If [these requests] can't be met, then I'd suggest recourse to Hume's advice in similar circumstances: 'to the flames'.\"\n\nChristian philosopher William Lane Craig has noted \"The idea that we live in a postmodern culture is a myth. In fact, a postmodern culture is an impossibility; it would be utterly unliveable. People are not relativistic when it comes to matters of science, engineering, and technology; rather, they are relativistic and pluralistic in matters of religion and ethics. But, of course, that's not postmodernism; that's modernism!\"\n\nFormal, academic critiques of postmodernism can also be found in works such as \"Beyond the Hoax\" and \"Fashionable Nonsense\".\n\nHowever, as for continental philosophy, American academics have tended to label it \"postmodernist\", especially practitioners of \"French Theory\". Such a trend might derive from U.S. departments of Comparative Literature. Félix Guattari, often considered a \"postmodernist\", rejected its theoretical assumptions by arguing that the structuralist and postmodernist visions of the world were not flexible enough to seek explanations in psychological, social and environmental domains at the same time.\n\nAnalytic philosopher Daniel Dennett declared, \"Postmodernism, the school of 'thought' that proclaimed 'There are no truths, only interpretations' has largely played itself out in absurdity, but it has left behind a generation of academics in the humanities disabled by their distrust of the very idea of truth and their disrespect for evidence, settling for 'conversations' in which nobody is wrong and nothing can be confirmed, only asserted with whatever style you can muster.\"\n\nDaniel A. Farber and Suzanna Sherry criticised Postmodernism for reducing the complexity of the modern world to an expression of power and for undermining truth and reason: \"If the modern era begins with the European Enlightenment, the postmodern era that captivates the radical multiculturalists begins with its rejection. According to the new radicals, the Enlightenment-inspired ideas that have previously structured our world, especially the legal and academic parts of it, are a fraud perpetrated and perpetuated by white males to consolidate their own power. Those who disagree are not only blind but bigoted. The Enlightenment's goal of an objective and reasoned basis for knowledge, merit, truth, justice, and the like is an impossibility: \"objectivity,\" in the sense of standards of judgment that transcend individual perspectives, does not exist. Reason is just another code word for the views of the privileged. The Enlightenment itself merely replaced one socially constructed view of reality with another, mistaking power for knowledge. There is naught but power.\"\n\nH. Sidky pointed out what he sees as several \"inherent flaws\" of a postmodern antiscience perspective, including the confusion of the authority of science (evidence) with the scientist conveying the knowledge; its self-contradictory claim that all truths are relative; and its strategic ambiguity. He sees 21st-century anti-scientific and pseudo-scientific approaches to knowledge, particularly in the United States, as rooted in a postmodernist \"decades-long academic assault on science:\" \"Many of those indoctrinated in postmodern anti-science went on to become conservative political and religious leaders, policymakers, journalists, journal editors, judges, lawyers, and members of city councils and school boards. Sadly, they forgot the lofty ideals of their teachers, except that science is bogus.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2521491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2521491", "title": "Robert McKee", "text": "Robert McKee\n\nRobert McKee (born 1941) is an author, lecturer and story consultant who is widely known for his popular \"Story Seminar\", which he developed when he was a professor at the University of Southern California. McKee is the author of \"Story: Substance, Structure, Style and the Principles of Screenwriting\", \"Dialogue: the Art of Verbal Action for Stage, Page and Screen\" and \"Storynomics: Story-Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World\". McKee also has the blog and online writers' resource \"Storylogue\".\n\nRobert McKee’s “Story Seminars” have been held around the globe including Boston, Moscow, Amsterdam, Beijing, Mumbai, Paris, Rio de Janeiro and yearly in New York City, Los Angeles, and London. The 3-day seminar teaches writers the principles of storytelling. McKee's one-day \"Genre Seminars\" teach writers the conventions of different styles of storytelling including thriller, comedy, horror, love story, action story, and writing for television.\n\nRather than teaching story as a \"mechanical\" form, McKee gained notoriety for teaching story principles, allowing writers for theater, novels, film and television freedom to apply them as they wish provided the story ultimately “works”.\n\nAfter consulting on business storytelling for various multinational companies including Microsoft, Nike, Hewlett-Packard, Time Warner, and Siemens, in the fall of 2013 McKee launched a seminar for the business community in Los Angeles, New York City, Beijing, and Malta. In 2018, McKee partnered with digital marketer and Skyword CEO Tom Gerace to write \"Storynomics: Story-Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World.\" Storynomics, and the accompanying seminar, instructs leaders, managers and marketers how to use story in strategic management, brand management, and business communications.\n\nRobert McKee began his theater career at the age of 9, playing the title role in a community theater production of 'Martin the Shoemaker'. He continued acting as a teenager in theater productions in his hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Upon receiving the Evans scholarship, he attended the University of Michigan and earned a Bachelor's degree in English Literature. While an undergraduate, he acted in and directed over thirty productions. McKee's creative writing professor was the noted Kenneth Thorpe Rowe.\n\nAfter completing his Bachelor of Arts degree, McKee toured with the APA (Association of Producing Artists) Repertory Company, appearing on Broadway alongside Helen Hayes, Rosemary Harris and Will Geer. He then received the Professional Theater Fellowship and returned to Ann Arbor, Michigan to earn his Master's degree in Theater Arts.\n\nUpon graduating, McKee directed the Toledo Repertory Company, acted with the American Drama Festival, and became Artistic Director of the Aaron Deroy Theater. From there he traveled to London to accept the position of Artist-in-residence at the National Theatre where he studied Shakespearean production at the Old Vic theatre. He then returned to New York City and spent the next seven years as an actor/director in Broadway.\n\nAfter deciding to move his career to film, McKee attended Cinema School at the University of Michigan. While there, he directed two short films: \"A Day Off\", which he also wrote, and \"Talk To Me Like The Rain\", adapted from a one-act play by Tennessee Williams. These two films won the Cine Eagle Award, awards at the Brussels and Grenoble Film Festivals, and various prizes at the Delta, Rochester, Chicago and Baltimore Film Festivals.\n\nIn 1979, McKee moved to Los Angeles, where he began to write screenplays and work as a story analyst for United Artists and NBC. He sold his first screenplay \"Dead Files\" to AVCO/Embassy Films, after which he joined the WGA (Writers Guild of America). His next screenplay, \"Hard Knocks\", won the National Screenwriting Contest, and since then McKee has had eight feature film screenplays purchased or optioned, including the feature film script \"Trophy\" for Warner Bros. (Only one of these films, however, was produced). In addition to his screenplays, McKee has had a number of scripts produced for television series such as \"Quincy, M.E.\" (starring Jack Klugman), \"Mrs. Columbo\" (starring Kate Mulgrew), \"\" and \"Kojak\" (starring Telly Savalas).\n\nIn 1983, as Fulbright Scholar, McKee joined the faculty of the School of Cinema-Television at the University of Southern California (USC), where he began offering his famous STORY Seminar class. A year later, McKee opened the course to the public, giving a 3-day, 30-hour intensive class to sold-out audiences around the world.\n\nSince 1984, more than 50,000 students have taken McKee's course, at various cities around the world: Los Angeles, New York, London, Paris, Sydney, Toronto, Boston, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Helsinki, Oslo, Munich, Tel Aviv, Auckland, Singapore, Barcelona, Stockholm, São Paulo and more. In March 2011 and again in 2012, he taught a four-day seminar in Bogotá, Colombia. In February 2012 he taught another four-day seminar in the Ramoji film city of Hyderabad in India. He did the same in Amsterdam, March 2014.\n\nMcKee's current lecture series includes the 3-day \"Story Seminar\", 1-day \"Genre Seminars\" (teaching the conventions of love Story, thriller, comedy, horror, action and writing for television) and the 1-day “Storynomics Seminar”, teaching the application of storytelling principles in the business and marketing world (co-lectured with CEO of Skyword Tom Gerace).\n\nMcKee continues to be a project consultant to major film and television production companies, corporations and governments around the world, as well major software firms such as Microsoft. In addition, several companies such as ABC, Disney, Miramax, PBS, Nickelodeon and Paramount regularly send their creative and writing staffs to his lectures. \n\nRobert McKee is among the most widely known screenwriting lecturers. McKee's former students include over 65 Academy Award winners, 200 Emmy Award winners, 100 WGA (Writers Guild of America) Award winners and 50 DGA (Directors Guild of America) Award winners (all participated in McKee's course before or after winning their award; not all were awarded for writing), the British Book of the Year Award and the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Some recent notable former students to win or be nominated for Oscars include Akiva Goldsman for his screenplay \"A Beautiful Mind,\" Peter Jackson (writer/director of \"Lord of the Rings I, II and III”), Andrew Stanton (“Wall*E,” “Finding Nemo”) and Paul Haggis (“Million Dollar Baby,” “Quantum of Solace”). \n\nHe was profiled by Bob Simon of \"60 Minutes\" for CBS News, and by CNN who also reviewed the Story Seminar. Notable writers and actors such as Geoffrey Rush, Paul Haggis, Akiva Goldsman, William Goldman, Joan Rivers, David Bowie, Kirk Douglas, John Cleese, Tony Kaye, Steven Pressfield, among many others have taken his seminar.\n\nIn 1990, Robert McKee was brought to New Zealand by the NZ Film Commission, and delivered a three-day seminar on screenplay and story structure in Auckland and Wellington. In the audience were Jane Campion and Peter Jackson, the latter of which went on to write and direct \"Heavenly Creatures\", \"The Lord of the Rings\", and \"King Kong\".\n\nIn 2000, McKee won the 1999 International Moving Image Book Award for his book \"Story\" (Regan Books/HarperCollins). The book, currently in its 19th printing in the United States and its 14th printing in the United Kingdom, has become required reading for film and cinema schools at Harvard, Yale, UCLA, USC and Tulane universities. The book was on the Los Angeles Times best-seller list for 20 weeks. It is translated into over 20 languages.\n\nIn 2017 McKee was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Final Draft Awards, an honor that recognizes professionals who have had a \"profound influence on the industry\" joining peers such as Lawrence Kasdan and Steven Zaillian.\n\nMcKee's other credits include writing and presenting the BBC series \"Filmworks\", the Channel Four series \"Reel Secrets\", the BAFTA Award-winning \"J'accuse Citizen Kane\" television program which he wrote and presented, and the writing of \"Abraham\", the four-hour mini-series on Turner Network Television (TNT) that starred Richard Harris, Barbara Hershey and Maximilian Schell.\n\n\nMcKee has been criticized by writer Joe Eszterhas, for teaching screenwriting without ever having a script of his made into a film. (However, McKee is credited as writer of the 1994 TV movie \"Abraham\".) McKee has responded to such criticisms, saying, \"The world is full of people who teach things they themselves cannot do\", while admitting that even though he sold all of his written screenplays, he still lacks their screen credit since they were only optioned and not ever produced by the studios.\n\nWhile McKee's work might appear to be a fresh approach to story structure, many of the ideas he discusses have been around since Aristotle and notably appear in the work of William Archer, John Howard Lawson and Alexander Mackendrick. Nevertheless, McKee himself tells his students that Aristotle is the basis for much of what he teaches and he often distributes some of John Howard Lawson's writings at his seminar: he acknowledges his forebears and never claims that he is inventing a brand new approach to story telling. Furthermore he claims that much of what he teaches was common knowledge 50 or 60 years ago, but that screenwriters have lost touch with the fundamentals of storytelling. In a CBC interview he said that to give his lecture in the 1930s, 40s or 50s \"would have been ludicrous\". McKee also appears and is criticized in several works, for example, \"Missionnaire\" by French author Joann Sfar.\n\nIn the Charlie Kaufman-penned film \"Adaptation.\", McKee's character was portrayed by the Emmy Award-winning actor Brian Cox. In the Oscar-winning movie, the desperate screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (played by Nicolas Cage) reluctantly goes to McKee's course, but then – after being \"shaken\" by McKee's tough-style response to his claim that \"nothing happens in the real world\" – Kaufman asks McKee to meet in person to discuss his failure to write the film adaptation he is working on.\n\nThough the story depicts McKee as little more than an amalgam of hack clichés on the subject of screen writing, Charlie's slacker brother Donald uses the knowledge obtained attending the famous seminar to write a spec script he then sells for a large amount of money through his brother's agent. The film then concludes with the very ending that McKee is ridiculed for recommending, as well as a voice-over epilogue in which — by means of voice-over narration — Cage's Kaufman character admonishes himself for disobeying a cardinal rule of McKee's to avoid voice-over narration.\n\nMcKee appeared on the \"Simpsons\" episode \"Caper Chase\" as himself.\n\n\n"}

The paintings depict his flower garden at his home in Giverny, and were the main focus of his artistic production during the last thirty years of his life. Many of the works were painted while Monet suffered from cataracts.\n\nMonet's long preference for producing and exhibiting a series of paintings related by subject and perspective began in 1889, with at least ten paintings done at the \"Valley of the Creuse\", which were shown at the Galerie Georges Petit. Among his other famous series are his \"Haystacks\".\n\nDuring the 1920s, the state of France built a pair of oval rooms at the Musée de l'Orangerie as a permanent home for eight water lily murals by Monet. The exhibit opened to the public on 16 May 1927, a few months after Monet's death. Sixty water lily paintings from around the world were assembled for a special exhibition at the Musée de l'Orangerie in 1999.\n\nThe paintings are on display at museums all over the world, including the Princeton University Art Museum, Musée Marmottan Monet, the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Saint Louis Art Museum, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the National Museum of Wales, the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Portland Art Museum and the Legion of Honor.\n\nOn 19 June 2007, one of Monet's water lily paintings sold for £18.5 million at a Sotheby's auction in London. On 24 June 2008 another of his water lily paintings, \"Le Bassin Aux Nymphéas\", sold for almost £41 million at Christie's in London, almost double the estimate of £18 to £24 million.\n\nIn May 2010, it was announced that the 1906 \"Nymphéas\" work would be auctioned in London in June 2010. The painting had an estimated sale price of between £30 and £40 million. Giovanna Bertazzoni, Christie's auction house director and head of impressionist and modern art, said, \"Claude Monet's water-lily paintings are amongst the most recognised and celebrated works of the 20th Century and were hugely influential to many of the following generations of artists.\" The sale took place on 23 June 2010 at the auction house and the painting attracted bids of up to £29 million, but it ultimately failed to sell.\n\nOn 6 May 2014, one of the Water Lilies paintings was auctioned at Christie's, New York City for $27 million.[16] This auction totaled $141 millon with the Monet piece Le bassin aux nymphéas being auctioned for $27 million of this amount. \n\nIn June of 2014, one of the Water Lilies, \"Nymphéas\", sold for $54 million USD at a Sotheby's auction in London. This piece was auctioned to an anonymous buyer, but the piece went on to be part of the exhibition \"Painting the Modern Garden: From Monet to Matisse\" at the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Royal Academy of Arts, London, starting in 2015. The co-chairman of Sotheby's modern and impressionist art department, Helena Newman, claims that the result is at the top of the original estimated selling price. This price was between 34 and 51 million USD. \n\nWhile many of Monet’s masterpieces have sold, there are still an estimated 250 oil paintings from this series. The collection is widely popular, with many of these pieces residing in exhibits that have yet to go to auction.\n\n"}
{"id": "5800889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5800889", "title": "Witham Shield", "text": "Witham Shield\n\nThe Witham Shield is an Iron Age decorative bronze shield facing of La Tène style, dating from about the 4th century BC. The shield was discovered in the River Witham in the vicinity of Washingborough and Fiskerton in Lincolnshire, England in 1826. Further excavations at a nearby site have revealed posts interpreted as the foundation for a causeway, as well as artefacts including a sword, spears and part of a human skull with a sword fragment lodged within. The shield now resides in the British Museum.\n\nThe Witham Shield is an example of the style of Celtic art known as La Tène. The bronze facings show evidence of having been reworked. The most noticeable feature is the central dome which would have been required for functional reasons as it allowed the owner to hold the shield close to its centre of gravity. Originally a leather silhouette of a long-legged wild boar would have been riveted to the shield around the central dome, as indicated by small rivet holes and staining of the shield. The pattern of discolouration was very clear when the shield was recovered from the River Witham (see 1863 drawing below). Although it is still possible to see the discolouration under certain lighting conditions, the boar design is no longer easy to make out. The boar may have been a tribal emblem or represented the prowess of the shield's owner, but could also have been a representation of the Celtic god Moccus. The shield also has a number of birds and animals incorporated into the design. The roundels at each end are inspired by the heads of birds, which are supported by horses with wings for ears. Birds similar to crested grebes are engraved on the central spine and this completes the engraving work elsewhere.\n\nThe shield was made principally from wood, now perished, to a design later known as a \"Gaulish Shield\" that originated in the seventh century BC. What remains is an almost complete facing that had been made to cover its surface. The sheeting is 0.2-0.3 mm thick and was designed to be applied to a wooden backing estimated at 8 mm thick. There are two main sheets that meet at the midpoint of the shield. Each of these sheets is just over one metre long. The join is not neat, and it is hidden from view by a covering strip. The shield is decorated with a central spindle boss, on which are pieces of red coral that are thought to have come from the Mediterranean area.\n\nThe shield has been described as a \"tour de force\" of beaten bronze work. There are no other complete bronze facings that survive in Europe. This is partially due to their rarity, as Celtic shields were normally constructed from unsheathed wood. The idea of covering a shield with bronze may indicate Greek and Etruscan influence. The shield is comparable with other shields found in Britain dating from the same period, such as the Chertsey Shield and the Battersea Shield which were also found in rivers. The British Museum consider this shield to be \"one of the best examples of the way British craftspeople adopted the new style of La Tène art\".\n\nThe shield entered the collection of Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick (1783–1848), a noted collector of arms and armour, and after his death the shield and other items of Iron Age armour were left to his cousin, Lt. Colonel Augustus Meyrick, who disposed of them between 1869 and 1872. The shield was purchased by Augustus Franks, an independently wealthy antiquarian who worked for the British Museum. In 1872 Franks presented the shield to the British Museum, one of over 20,000 objects that he donated to the museum during his lifetime or by bequest at his death.\n\nAn unusual triple headed dress pin was also found in 1826. This pin set was also found in the River Witham near Fiskerton. This is described as the only surviving set of triple dress pins and has been dated as 8th century and Anglo-Saxon. The pin set is also held in the British Museum.\n\nIn the 20th century a series of posts were found together with an early to mid Iron Age sword when a dyke was being cleaned near Fiskerton, near where the Witham Shield had been found. Excavations in 1981 revealed the posts to be a wooden causeway which dendrochronologists dated to a period between 457 and 300 BC. It appeared to have been repaired and added to every eighteen years or so during that period, even though the construction and maintenance of a walkway on such a scale at that time would have been a major feat of engineering. Hundreds of artifacts were also found around the causeway, including eleven spears, six swords, woodworking and metalworking tools, as well as part of a human skull which had a crescent-shaped chop mark, probably inflicted by a sword; this injury is unlikely to have killed the man.\n\nTwenty years later, during further excavations at the site, more sections of the causeway were dug out, some of them containing posts several metres long, plus a complete spear, a currency bar, a sword, a dagger and some bronze fittings, all of which appeared to have been deliberately damaged before their burial. The most important discovery was two Iron Age votive boats. One of these boats, as well as other artifacts from the site, can be seen at The Collection in Lincoln. The area around the site of the causeway was opened as a nature reserve managed by the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust in 2006.\n\n\n"}
