As such, \"A Perfumed Scorpion\" can be read as part of a whole course of study.\n\nThe book contains the substance of lectures given by the author at various universities in the United States under the aegis of the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge and the Graduate Institute of International Studies, Fairleigh Dickinson University. The ‘perfuming of a scorpion’ is a reference to a symbol used by Bahaudin Naqshband of Bukhara when he taught about the ubiquitous problem of hypocrisy and self-deception in both individuals and institutions: “Whoever might perfume a scorpion will not thereby escape its sting”.\n\nThe seven sections of the book deal in depth with this issue under headings such as Education, The Nature of Sufi Knowledge, The Path and the Duties and the Techniques, Teaching Stories, A framework for New Knowledge and Involvement in Sufi Study. Each section contains numerous illustrative anecdotes from contemporary life but is nevertheless rooted in the teaching patterns of Rumi, Hafiz, Jami, and other great Oriental sages who dealt with the need for, and the path to, knowledge and information before real progress can be made.\n\n\"A Perfumed Scorpion\" was described by one reviewer as \"... an invigorating and abrasive book, like jumping into icy water - hard to do, but you're glad you have done it.\" This reviewer also appreciated the way it dissolves in the attentive reader “the maiming effect of unconscious bias.” The influence of the book continues and it has remained in print ever since it was published.\n\nPhilosopher of science and physicist Henri Bortoft used teaching tales from Shah's corpus as analogies of the habits of mind which prevented people from grasping the scientific method of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Bortoft's \"\" includes stories from \"Tales of the Dervishes\", \"The Exploits of the Incomparable Mulla Nasrudin\" and \"A Perfumed Scorpion\".\n\n\n"}

Alternative formats are created to help people who are blind or visual impaired to gain assess to their personal and leisure information either by sight (large print), by ear (audio) or by touch (braille).\n\nAudio information is beneficial for many people and can be used by anyone who owns a CD player, a DAISY player or a computer. Audio enables people who are blind or visual impaired to access information through hearing, in the sense that print readers would understand it. \n\nDifferent people are likely to have their own preferences about the way they access audio, depending on their experiences, how comfortable are they with technology, and the equipment they to access the audio content.\n\nCompact Discs (CDs) were first produced in the 1980s to store and playback sound recordings exclusively, and became superior to cassette tapes (AC) offering better sound and size. Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres (4.7 in) and can hold up to 80 minutes of uncompressed audio (or 700 Megabytes of data). CDs offer some navigation from the beginning of one track to another, rather than having to fast forward or rewind and guess where the tracks started and finished.\n\nOver time, CDs have progressed from being solely for music, to being a format for all kinds of data storage, such as text, images, photos and videos. Educators can use CDs to store educational materials including taped lectures, presentations, and handouts into one compact disc for the student to access on CD players or computers.\n\nBraille is a tactile system of raised dots that enables people who are visual impaired or blind to access information by touch. The pattern of raised dots is arranged in cells of up to six dots, creating a total of 63 different combinations possible. Each cell represents an alphabet letter, numeral or punctuation mark. Some frequently used words and letter combinations also have their own single cell patterns.\nBraille can be the building block for language skills and a way to teach spelling, grammar, and punctuations to people with vision loss or who are deaf-blind. Not only do Braille codes represent alphabets, they also denote numbers, symbols, music and mathematical notations, enabling people to learn about different subjects in a different way from most of us. Braille books are available in all subject areas, ranging from modern fiction to mathematics, music and law. As with printed text, Braille makes it possible for people to access information in this format.\n\nFor many of us, having access to computer equipment and appropriate software makes written information accessible. Today’s technology allows people to do majority of their research online, share documents via email, and download lecture notes from school websites. With written text converted into a format that is readable on the computer, it can be accessed visually with screen magnification software, or through auditory means with text-to-speech technology.\n\nLarge print is essential for people who have visual or learning difficulties and have trouble reading fine print or deciphering crowded text at one time. Large print usually ranges from 16 to 22 point, while giant print uses fonts that are bigger than 24 point.\n\nHaving one single size will not meet everyone’s needs; therefore, it is important to find out which is a comfortable reading size for each individual. Research has demonstrated the positive impacts of providing enlarged font size for people with mild to moderate visual impairments, resulting in an increased reading fluency and speed.\n"}
{"id": "9911893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9911893", "title": "Amaru Shataka", "text": "Amaru Shataka\n\nThe Amaruśataka or Amarukaśataka (अमरुशतक, \"the hundred stanzas of Amaru\"), authored by Amaru (also Amaruka), is a collection of poems dated to about the 7th or 8th century.\n\nThe \"Amaruśataka\" ranks as one of the finest lyrical poetry in the annals of Sanskrit literature, ranking with Kalidasa and 's \"\". The ninth-century literary critic Anandavardhana declared in his \"Dhvanyaloka\" that \"a single stanza of the poet Amaru ... may provide the taste of love equal to what's found in whole volumes.\" Its verses have been used by poets and critics as examples and standards to judge other poems by. Andrew Schelling describes it as \"love poetry original and vivid as that produced anywhere on the planet\".\n\nIts subject is mostly Sringara (erotic love, romantic love) including aspects such as love, passion, estrangement, longing, rapprochement, joy and sorrow, etc. Greg Bailey notes that it is \"as much about the social aspects of courting, betrayal, feminine indignance and masculine self-pity as it is about sensuality\". Similarly, Schelling notes: \"All the flavours or nuances of love are said to lie within the book, though you'll notice that the emphasis falls more on the bitter taste of separation or betrayal than on the sweetness of consummation.\"\n\nNot much is known about the life of Amaru. Traditional accounts attribute the work to King Amaru of Kashmir. The collection in its present form may well represent the work of more than one author—the poems that form part of the collection differ quite significantly across its different regional recensions.\n\nThere are also a number of legends associating the collection with the philosopher Adi Shankara. One version occurs in his 14th century biography written by a follower, the \"Shankara-digvijaya\". According to this version, during his debate with Maṇḍana Miśra, he was asked philosophical questions phrased in metaphors of love by the latter's wife, Ubhaya Bharati. Being celibate and therefore ignorant of the \"kama shastras\", Shankara requested an adjournment. He then entered the recently dead body of Amaru and spent a hundred days mastering the art of erotic love, before returning to defeat his opponent. He wrote the Amarushataka to memorialise his learning.\n\nAnother version, given in Ravichandra's commentary on the Amarushataka, states that Shankara composed these poems to impart spiritual insight to the epicurean king Amaru, in metaphors he might understand. When this was misunderstood and mocked by the advisers at the court, Shankara entered the body of Amaru and provided a spiritual exegesis of the poems.\n\nAccordingly, several manuscripts add colophons naming Shankara as the true author of the work, and Ravichandra, a mediaeval commentator on the Bengal recension of the Amarusataka, read metaphysical meanings into the verses. Other legends also state that Amaru was the 101st reincarnation of a soul that had previously occupied 100 women.\n\n\n\n"}

It is bound roughly by North 19th Street to the north, North 10th Street to the south, North East 2nd Avenue to the west, and Biscayne Boulevard to the east.\n\nThe Arts & Entertainment District is an urban, residential neighborhood with many high-rise residential towers, as well as some smaller scale historic buildings. It is home to the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, the old \"Miami Herald\" headquarters (now located in Doral, Florida), and the Omni International Mall. Until 2014 it was one of the neighborhoods that hosted the annual Miami International Boat Show at the Sea Isle Marina. The City of Miami Cemetery, one of Miami's oldest cemeteries, is also located in the district, as well as the historic Women's Club, and some of Miami's oldest churches and synagogues.\n\nThe Arts & Entertainment District is served by the Omni Loop branch of the Metromover and by the Metrorail via Metromover at Government Center.\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1950s, the Omni area was a high-end shopping area with many major department stores along Biscayne Boulevard, such as Sears, Roebuck and Company (whose tower still stands at the Arsht Center), Jordan Marsh (NE 15th Street and Biscayne Blvd) built in 1956, and a Burdines (NE 14th Street and Biscayne Blvd). By 1930, this area of Biscayne Boulevard was the home of Sears (later Burdines) Store, and the Shrine Building (which still stands at NE 14th Street and Biscayne Blvd), all of which were designed and built by the Biscayne Boulevard Company in the Art Deco architectural style. The area from NE 13th to NE 16th Street was envisioned as a high-end shopping district. By 1930, early tenants in the Shrine Building included the Piggly-Wiggly grocery store, Biscayne-Page Electric Company, and the John Turner Piano Store on the first floor. Other tenants in 1930 were the Home Drug Store and the Burroughs Adding Machine Company.\n\nIn 1977, the Omni International Mall opened replacing much of the street-side stores with a suburban-style shopping mall. The mall brought many upscale stores to the Omni such as Emilio Pucci, Givenchy and Hermes. By the 1990s, however, the mall began to falter, and in 1991, Jordan Marsh closed, and in 1998, so did JC Penney. In 2000, the mall closed, and the area was reconverted into offices in 2007. Today, it houses a few office tenants and the Miami International University of Art and Design. It is also the corporate home of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce. The name of the neighborhood today, comes from the name of the Omni Mall.\n\nIn the 2000s, rapid construction of high-rise residential skyscrapers has revitalized the neighborhood from urban blight. The area around Margaret Pace Park has seen large population growth from 2000 to 2010. Omni today has a large residential population, and with continued retail and residential construction in the neighborhood, has grown into its own unique neighborhood in the city.\n\n\nMetromover train system runs three lines throughout Downtown (the Downtown Loop, the Omni Loop, and the Brickell Loop). The Metromover connects with Metrorail and is free. There are two Metromover stations in the district- School Board Station and Adrienne Arsht Center. Transfers can be made to the Metrorail, Miami's heavy rail system, at Government Center, as well as to the Brickell and Inner Metromover loops. Metrorail has stops throughout Miami with connections to Miami International Airport, all Miami-Dade County bus lines, Tri-Rail and Amtrak. The main bus station is also located in the district, next to the Arsht Center at the Adrienne Arsht Center station.\n\nThe Arts & Entertainment District is served by Metrobus throughout the area, the Miami Metrorail, and the Metromover:\n\nMetrorail:\n\nMetromover:\n\nAs an urban and pedestrian-friendly area with an extensive public transit network, the Arts & Entertainment District and the greater Downtown area, is one of the areas in Miami where a car-free lifestyle is commonplace. Many residents get around by foot, bicycle, Metromover or by taxi. The Metromover is a popular alternative to walking in the area, especially on rainy, hot or cold days, as the Metromover is free, and stations are located roughly every two blocks throughout the area.\n\nRecently, the City of Miami, along with the Downtown Development Authority, has begun bicycle initiaves promoting citywide bike parking and bike lanes, that have made bicycling much more popular for residents. Bike lanes and bike sharrows are currently planned for the majority of Downtown streets to be painted by the end of 2010. The Venetian Causeway is a popular bicycle commuter route that connects South Beach to Omni. The Rickenbacker Causeway is very popular on weekends for recreational bicyclists, and often, bicycles can outnumber cars on the causeway.\n\n\nAlthough one of Miami's oldest neighborhoods, few buildings remain in the district from its founding days. Some historic buildings in the area include:\n\n"}

Created in 1996 by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario (Bill Pr56), the Association is Canada's only accredited body of graphic designers with a legislated title and the second such accredited body of graphic designers in the world. RGD certifies graphic designers and promotes knowledge sharing, continuous learning, research, advocacy and mentorship.\n\nRGD works to establish professional standards and innovative thinking within the graphic design industry. The association assumes an advocacy role for best practices for both graphic designers and the clients they work with. They focus on issues such as spec work and crowdsourcing, accessibility, sustainability, salaries and billing practices, pro bono work and internship guidelines.\n\nRGD advocacy initiatives include:\n\nIn 1956, Toronto-based designers Frank Davies, John Gibson, Frank Newfeld and Sam Smart formed the Society of Typographic Designers of Canada (TDC). The TDC was later renamed the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada (GDC) to reflect the wider interests of its members.\n\nBy 1984 many other design disciplines such as Architecture and Interior Design had been given Acts in Provincial Legislatures so that their respective associations could govern and grant their members exclusive professional designations. RGD's founders recognized the need to align Graphic Design with other design professionals. To ensure Graphic Design could also advance as an acknowledged profession the Association's founders decided to incorporate the Association of Registered Graphic Designers (RGD).\n\nOn April 25, 1996 Bill Pr56 was passed and Royal Assent was given to an Act Respecting The Association of Registered Graphic Designers by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

{"id": "165329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165329", "title": "Baron Munchausen", "text": "Baron Munchausen\n\nBaron Munchausen (; ) is a fictional German nobleman created by the German writer Rudolf Erich Raspe in his 1785 book \"Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia\". The character is loosely based on a real baron, Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen (; 1720–1797).\n\nBorn in Bodenwerder, Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, the real-life Münchhausen fought for the Russian Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739. Upon retiring in 1760, he became a minor celebrity within German aristocratic circles for telling outrageous tall tales based on his military career. After hearing some of Münchhausen's stories, Raspe adapted them anonymously into literary form, first in German as ephemeral magazine pieces and then in English as the 1785 book, which was first published in Oxford by a bookseller named Smith. The book was soon translated into other European languages, including a German version expanded by the poet Gottfried August Bürger. The real-life Münchhausen was deeply upset at the development of a fictional character bearing his name, and threatened legal proceedings against the book's publisher. Perhaps fearing a libel suit, Raspe never acknowledged his authorship of the work, which was only established posthumously.\n\nThe fictional Baron's exploits, narrated in the first person, focus on his impossible achievements as a sportsman, soldier, and traveller, for instance riding on a cannonball, fighting a forty-foot crocodile, and travelling to the Moon. Intentionally comedic, the stories play on the absurdity and inconsistency of Munchausen's claims, and contain an undercurrent of social satire. The earliest illustrations of the character, perhaps created by Raspe himself, depict Munchausen as slim and youthful, although later illustrators have depicted him as an older man, and have added the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache that have become part of the character's definitive visual representation. Raspe's book was a major international success, becoming the core text for numerous English, continental European, and American editions that were expanded and rewritten by other writers. The book in its various revised forms remained widely read throughout the 19th century, especially in editions for young readers.\n\nVersions of the fictional Baron have appeared on stage, screen, radio, and television, as well as in other literary works. Though the Baron Munchausen stories are no longer well-known in many English-speaking countries, they are still popular in continental Europe. The character has inspired numerous memorials and museums, and several medical conditions and other concepts are named after him, including Munchausen syndrome, the Münchhausen trilemma, and Munchausen numbers.\n\nHieronymus Karl Friedrich von Münchhausen was born on 11 May 1720 in Bodenwerder, Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg. He was a younger son of the \"Black Line\" of Rinteln-Bodenwerder, an aristocratic family in the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. His cousin, Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen, was the founder of the University of Göttingen and later the Prime Minister of the Electorate of Hanover. Münchhausen started as a page to Anthony Ulrich II of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and followed his employer to the Russian Empire during the Russo-Austro–Turkish War (1735–39). In 1739, he was appointed a cornet in the Russian cavalry regiment, the Brunswick-Cuirassiers. On 27 November 1740, he was promoted to lieutenant. He was stationed in Riga, but participated in two campaigns against the Turks in 1740 and 1741. In 1744 he married Jacobine von Dunten, and in 1750 he was promoted to \"Rittmeister\" (cavalry captain).\n\nIn 1760 Münchhausen retired to live as a \"Freiherr\" at his estates in Bodenwerder, where he remained until his death in 1797. It was there, especially at parties given for the area's aristocrats, that he developed a reputation as an imaginative after-dinner storyteller, creating witty and highly exaggerated accounts of his adventures in Russia. Over the ensuing thirty years, his storytelling abilities gained such renown that he frequently received visits from travelling nobles wanting to hear his tales. One guest described Münchhausen as telling his stories \"cavalierly, indeed with military emphasis, yet without any concession to the whimsicality of the man of the world; describing his adventures as one would incidents which were in the natural course of events\". Rather than being considered a liar, Münchhausen was seen as an honest man. As another contemporary put it, Münchhausen's unbelievable narratives were designed not to deceive, but \"to ridicule the disposition for the marvellous which he observed in some of his acquaintances\".\n\nMünchhausen's wife Jacobine von Dunten died in 1790. In January 1794, Münchhausen married Bernardine von Brunn, fifty-seven years his junior. Von Brunn reportedly took ill soon after the marriage and spent the summer of 1794 in the spa town of Bad Pyrmont, although contemporary gossip claimed that she spent her time dancing and flirting. Von Brunn gave birth to a daughter, Maria Wilhemina, on 16 February 1795, nine months after her summer trip. Münchhausen filed an official complaint that the child was not his, and spent the last years of his life in divorce proceedings and alimony litigation. Münchhausen died childless on 22 February 1797.\n\nThe fictionalized character was created by a German writer, scientist, and con artist, Rudolf Erich Raspe. Raspe probably met Hieronymus von Münchhausen while studying at the University of Göttingen, and may even have been invited to dine with him at the mansion at Bodenwerder. Raspe's later career mixed writing and scientific scholarship with theft and swindling; when the German police issued advertisements for his arrest in 1775, he fled continental Europe and settled in England.\n\nIn his native German language, Raspe wrote a collection of anecdotes inspired by Münchhausen's tales, calling the collection \"M-h-s-nsche Geschichten\" (\"M-h-s-n Stories\"). It remains unclear how much of Raspe's material comes directly from the Baron, but the majority of the stories are derived from older sources, including Heinrich Bebel's \"Facetiæ\" (1508) and Samuel Gotthold Lange's \"Deliciæ Academicæ\" (1765). \"M-h-s-nsche Geschichten\" appeared as a feature in the eighth issue of the \"Vade mecum für lustige Leute\" (\"Handbook for Fun-loving People\"), a Berlin humor magazine, in 1781. Raspe published a sequel, \"Noch zwei M-Lügen\" (\"Two more M-Fibs\"), in the tenth issue of the same magazine in 1783. The hero and narrator of these stories was identified only as \"M-h-s-n\", keeping Raspe's inspiration partly obscured while still allowing knowledgeable German readers to make the connection to Münchhausen. Raspe's name did not appear at all.\n\nIn 1785, while supervising mines at Dolcoath in Cornwall, Raspe adapted the \"Vade mecum\" anecdotes into a short English-language book, this time identifying the narrator of the book as \"Baron Munchausen\". Other than the anglicization of Münchhausen to \"Munchausen\", Raspe this time made no attempt to hide the identity of the man who had inspired him, though he still withheld his own name.\n\nThis English edition, the first version of the text in which Munchausen appeared as a fully developed literary character, had a circuitous publication history. It first appeared anonymously as \"Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia\", a 49-page book in 12mo size, published in Oxford by the bookseller Smith in late 1785 and sold for a shilling. A second edition released early the following year, retitled \"Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Sporting Adventures of Baron Munnikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen\", added five more stories and four illustrations; though the book was still anonymous, the new text was probably by Raspe, and the illustrations may have been his work as well.\n\nBy May 1786, Raspe no longer had control over the book, which was taken over by a different publisher, G. Kearsley. Kearsley, intending the book for a higher-class audience than the original editions had been, commissioned extensive additions and revisions from other hands, including new stories, twelve new engravings, and much rewriting of Raspe's prose. This third edition was sold at two shillings, twice the price of the original, as \"Gulliver Revived, or the Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Adventures of Baron Munikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen\".\n\nKearsley's version was a marked popular success. Over the next few years, the publishing house issued further editions in quick succession, adding still more non-Raspe material along the way; even the full-length \"Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen\", again not by Raspe and originally published in 1792 by a rival printer, was quickly subsumed into the body of stories. In the process of revision, Raspe's prose style was heavily modified; instead of his conversational language and sportsmanlike turns of phrase, Kearsley's writers opted for a blander and more formal tone imitating Augustan prose. Most ensuing English-language editions, including even the major editions produced by Thomas Seccombe in 1895 and F. J. Harvey Darton in 1930, reproduce one of the rewritten Kearsley versions rather than Raspe's original text.\n\nAt least ten editions or translations of the book appeared before Raspe's death in 1794. Translations of the book into French, Spanish, and German were published in 1786. The text reached the United States in 1805, expanded to include American topical satire by an anonymous Federalist writer, probably Thomas Green Fessenden.\n\nThe first German translation, \"Wunderbare Reisen zu Wasser und Lande\", was made by the German Romantic poet Gottfried August Bürger. Bürger's text is a close translation of Smith's second edition, but also includes an interpolated story, based on a German legend called \"The Six Wonderful Servants\". Two new engravings were added to illustrate the interpolated material. The German version of the stories proved to be even more popular than the English one. A second German edition in 1788 included heavily altered material from an expanded Kearsley edition, and an original German sequel, \"Nachtrag zu den wunderbaren Reisen zu Wasser und Lande\", was published in 1789. After these publications, the English and Continental versions of the Raspe text continued to diverge, following increasingly different traditions of included material.\n\nRaspe, probably for fear of a libel suit from the real-life Baron von Münchhausen, never admitted his authorship of the book. It was often credited to Bürger, sometimes with an accompanying rumor that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen had met Bürger in Pyrmont and dictated the entire work to him. Another rumor, which circulated widely soon after the German translation was published, claimed that it was a competitive collaboration by three University of Göttingen scholars—Bürger, Abraham Gotthelf Kästner, and Georg Christoph Lichtenberg—with each of the three trying to outdo one another by writing the most unbelievable tale. The scholar Johann Georg Meusel correctly credited Raspe for the core text, but mistakenly asserted that Raspe had written it in German and that an anonymous translator was responsible for the English version. Raspe's authorship was finally proven in 1824 by Bürger's biographer, Karl Reinhard.\n\nIn the first few years after publication, German readers widely assumed that the real-life Baron von Münchhausen was responsible for the stories. According to witnesses, Münchhausen was deeply angry that the book had dragged his name into public consciousness and insulted his honor as a nobleman. Münchhausen became a recluse, refusing to host parties or tell any more stories, and he attempted without success to bring legal proceedings against Bürger and the publisher of the translation.\n\nThe following tables summarize the early publication history of Raspe's text, from 1785 to 1800. Unless otherwise referenced, information in the tables comes from the Munchausen bibliography established by John Patrick Carswell.\n\nThe fictional Baron Munchausen is a braggart soldier, most strongly defined by his comically exaggerated boasts about his own adventures; all of the stories in Raspe's book are told in first-person narrative, with a prefatory note explaining that \"the Baron is supposed to relate these extraordinary Adventures over his Bottle, when surrounded by his Friends\". The Baron's stories imply him to be a superhuman figure who spends most of his time either getting out of absurd predicaments or indulging in equally absurd moments of gentle mischief. In some of his best-known stories, the Baron rides a cannonball, travels to the Moon, is swallowed by a giant fish in the Mediterranean Sea, saves himself from drowning by pulling on his own hair, fights a forty-foot crocodile, enlists a wolf to pull his sleigh, and uses laurel tree branches to fix his horse when the animal is accidentally cut in two.\n\nIn the stories he narrates, the Baron is shown as a calm, rational man, describing what he experiences with simple objectivity; absurd happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events he has not witnessed himself. The resulting narrative effect is an ironic tone, encouraging skepticism in the reader and marked by a running undercurrent of subtle social satire. In addition to his fearlessness when hunting and fighting, he is suggested to be a debonair, polite gentleman given to moments of gallantry, with a scholarly penchant for knowledge, a tendency to be pedantically accurate about details in his stories, and a deep appreciation for food and drink of all kinds. The Baron also provides a solid geographical and social context for his narratives, peppering them with topical allusions and satire about recent events; indeed, many of the references in Raspe's original text are to historical incidents in the real-life Münchhausen's military career.\n\nBecause the feats the Baron describes are overtly implausible, they are easily recognizable as fiction, with a strong implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.\n\nIllustrators of the Baron stories have included Thomas Rowlandson, Alfred Crowquill, George Cruikshank, Ernst Ludwig Riepenhausen, Theodor Hosemann, Adolf Schrödter, Gustave Doré, William Strang, W. Heath Robinson, and Ronald Searle. The Finnish-American cartoonist Klaus Nordling featured the Baron in a weekly \"Baron Munchausen\" comic strip from 1935 to 1937, and in 1962, Raspe's text was adapted for \"Classics Illustrated\" #146 (British series), with both interior and cover art by the British cartoonist Denis Gifford.\n\nIn the first published illustrations, which may have been drawn by Raspe himself, the Baron appears slim and youthful. For the 1792 \"Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen\", an anonymous artist drew the Baron as a dignified but tired old soldier whose face is marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the Baron for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a Théophile Gautier \"fils\" translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the Baron a healthier and more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.\n\nThe relationship between the real and fictional Barons is complex. On the one hand, the fictional Baron Munchausen can be easily distinguished from the historical figure Hieronymus von Münchhausen; the character is so separate from his namesake that at least one critic, the writer W. L. George, concluded that the namesake's identity was irrelevant to the general reader, and Richard Asher named Munchausen syndrome using the anglicized spelling so that the disorder would reference the character rather than the real person. On the other hand, Münchhausen remains strongly connected to the character he inspired, and is still nicknamed the \"Lügenbaron\" (\"Baron of Lies\") in German. As the Munchausen researcher Bernhard Wiebel has said, \"These two barons are the same and they are not the same.\"\n\nReviewing the first edition of Raspe's book in December 1785, a writer in \"The Critical Review\" commented appreciatively:\n\nA writer for \"The English Review\" around the same time was less approving: \"We do not understand how a collection of lies can be called a satire on lying, any more than the adventures of a woman of pleasure can be called a satire on fornication.\"\n\nW. L. George described the fictional Baron as a \"comic giant\" of literature, describing his boasts as \"splendid, purposeless lie[s] born of the joy of life\". Théophile Gautier \"fils\" highlighted that the Baron's adventures are endowed with an \"absurd logic pushed to the extreme and which backs away from nothing\". According to an interview, Jules Verne relished reading the Baron stories as a child, and used them as inspiration for his own adventure novels. Thomas Seccombe commented that \"Munchausen has undoubtedly achieved [a permanent place in literature] ... The Baron's notoriety is universal, his character proverbial, and his name as familiar as that of Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, or Robinson Crusoe.\"\n\nSteven T. Byington wrote that \"Munchausen's modest seat in the Valhalla of classic literature is undisputed\", comparing the stories to American tall tales and concluding that the Baron is \"the patriarch, the perfect model, the fadeless fragrant flower, of liberty from accuracy\". The folklore writer Alvin Schwartz cited the Baron stories as one of the most important influences on the American tall tale tradition. In a 2012 study of the Baron, the literary scholar Sarah Tindal Kareem noted that \"Munchausen embodies, in his deadpan presentation of absurdities, the novelty of fictionality [and] the sophistication of aesthetic illusion\", adding that the additions to Raspe's text made by Kearsley and others tend to mask these ironic literary qualities by emphasizing that the Baron is lying.\n\nBy the beginning of the 19th century, Kearsley's phenomenally popular version of Raspe's book had spread to abridged chapbook editions for young readers, who soon became the main audience for the stories. The book, especially in its adaptations for children, remained widely popular throughout the century. It was translated into nearly all languages spoken in Europe; Robert Southey referred to it as \"a book which everybody knows, because all boys read it\". Notable later translations include Gautier's French rendering and Korney Chukovsky's popular Russian adaptation. By the 1850s, \"Munchausen\" had come into slang use as a verb meaning \"to tell extravagantly untruthful pseudo-autobiographical stories\". Robert Chambers, in an 1863 almanac, cited the iconic 1792 illustration of the Baron by asking rhetorically:\n\nThough Raspe's book is no longer widely read by English speakers, the Munchausen stories remain popular in Europe, especially in Germany and in Russia.\n\nAs well as the many augmented and adapted editions of Raspe's text, the fictional Baron has occasionally appeared in other standalone works. In 1838–39, Karl Leberecht Immermann published the long novel \"Münchhausen: Eine Geschichte in Arabesken\" (\"Münchhausen: A History of Arabesques\") as an homage to the character, and Adolf Ellissen's \"Munchausens Lügenabenteur\", an elaborate expansion of the stories, appeared in 1846. In his 1886 philosophical treatise \"Beyond Good and Evil\", Friedrich Nietzsche uses one of the Baron's adventures, the one in which he rescues himself from a swamp, as a metaphor for belief in complete metaphysical free will; Nietzsche calls this belief an attempt \"to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the swamps of nothingness\".\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Baron appeared as a character in John Kendrick Bangs's comic novels \"A House-Boat on the Styx\", \"Pursuit of the House-Boat\", and \"The Enchanted Type-Writer\". Shortly after, in 1901, Bangs published \"Mr. Munchausen\", a collection of new Munchausen stories, closely following the style and humor of the original tales. Hugo Gernsback's second novel, \"Baron Münchhausen's New Scientific Adventures\", put the Baron character in a science fiction setting; the novel was serialized in \"The Electrical Experimenter\" from May 1915 to February 1917.\n\nPierre Henri Cami's character Baron de Crac, a French soldier and courtier under Louis XV, is an imitation of the Baron Munchausen stories. In 1998, the British game designer James Wallis used the Baron character to create a multi-player storytelling game, \"The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen\", in which players improvise Munchausen-like first-person stories while overcoming objections and other interruptions from opponents. The American writer Peter David had the Baron narrate an original short story, \"Diego and the Baron\", in 2018.\n\nSadler's Wells Theatre produced the pantomime \"Baron Munchausen; or, Harlequin's Travels\" in London in 1795, starring the actor-singer-caricaturist Robert Dighton as the Baron; another pantomime based on the Raspe text, \"Harlequin Munchausen, or the Fountain of Love\", was produced in London in 1818. Herbert Eulenberg made the Baron the main character of a 1900 play, \"Münchhausen\", and the Expressionist writer Walter Hasenclever turned the stories into a comedy, \"Münchhausen\", in 1934. Grigori Gorin used the Baron as the hero of his 1976 play \"That Very Munchausen\"; a film version was made in 1980. \"Baron Prášil\", a Czech musical about the Baron, opened in 2010 in Prague. The following year, the National Black Light Theatre of Prague toured the United Kingdom with a nonmusical production of \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\".\n\nIn 1932, the comedy writer Billy Wells adapted Baron Munchausen for a radio comedy routine starring the comedians Jack Pearl and Cliff Hall. In the routine, Pearl's Baron would relate his unbelievable experiences in a thick German accent to Hall's \"straight man\" character, Charlie. When Charlie had had enough and expressed disbelief, the Baron would invariably retort: \"Vass \"you\" dere, Sharlie?\" The line became a popular and much-quoted catchphrase, and by early 1933 \"The Jack Pearl Show\" was the second most popular series on American radio (after Eddie Cantor's program). Pearl attempted to adapt his portrayal to film in \"Meet the Baron\" in 1933, playing a modern character mistaken for the Baron, but the film was not a success. Pearl's popularity gradually declined between 1933 and 1937, though he attempted to revive the Baron character several times before ending his last radio series in 1951.\n\nFor a 1972 Caedmon Records recording of some of the stories, Peter Ustinov voiced the Baron. A review in \"The Reading Teacher\" noted that Ustinov's portrayal highlighted \"the braggadocio personality of the Baron\", with \"self-adulation ... plainly discernible in the intonational innuendo\".\n\nThe early French filmmaker Georges Méliès, who greatly admired the Baron Munchausen stories, filmed \"Baron Munchausen's Dream\" in 1911. Méliès's short silent film, which has little in common with the Raspe text, follows a sleeping Baron through a surrealistic succession of intoxication-induced dreams. Méliès may also have used the Baron's journey to the moon as an inspiration for his well-known 1902 film \"A Trip to the Moon\". In the late 1930s, he planned to collaborate with the Dada artist Hans Richter on a new film version of the Baron stories, but the project was left unfinished at his death in 1938. Richter attempted to complete it the following year, taking on Jacques Prévert, Jacques Brunius, and Maurice Henry as screenwriters, but the beginning of the Second World War put a permanent halt to the production.\n\nThe French animator Émile Cohl produced a version of the stories using silhouette cutout animation in 1913; other animated versions were produced by Richard Felgenauer in Germany in 1920, and by Paul Peroff in the United States in 1929. Colonel Heeza Liar, the protagonist of the first animated cartoon series in cinema history, was created by John Randolph Bray in 1913 as an amalgamation of the Baron and Teddy Roosevelt. The Italian director Paolo Azzurri filmed \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" in 1914, and the British director F. Martin Thornton made a short silent film featuring the Baron, \"The New Adventures of Baron Munchausen\", the following year. In 1940, the Czech director Martin Frič filmed \"Baron Prášil\", starring the comic actor Vlasta Burian as a 20th-century descendant of the Baron.\n\nFor the German film studio Ufa's 25th anniversary in 1943, Joseph Goebbels hired the filmmaker Josef von Báky to direct \"Münchhausen\", a big-budget color film about the Baron. David Stewart Hull describes Hans Albers's Baron as \"jovial but somewhat sinister\", while Tobias Nagle writes that Albers imparts \"a male and muscular zest for action and testosterone-driven adventure\". A German musical comedy, \"Münchhausen in Afrika\", made as a vehicle for the Austrian singing star Peter Alexander, appeared in 1957. Karel Zeman's 1961 Czech film \"The Fabulous Baron Munchausen\" commented on the Baron's adventures from a contemporary perspective, highlighting the importance of the poetic imagination to scientific achievement; Zeman's stylized \"mise-en-scène\", based on Doré's illustrations for the book, combined animation with live-action actors, including Miloš Kopecký as the Baron.\n\nIn the Soviet Union in 1929 by Daniil Cherkes was released cartoon \"Adventures of Munchausen\".\n\nIn the Soviet Union, Soyuzmultfilm released a 16-minute stop-motion animation \"Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" in 1967, directed by Anatoly Karanovich. Another Soviet animated version was produced as a series of short films, \"Munchausen's Adventures\", in 1973 and 1974. The French animator Jean Image filmed \"The Fabulous Adventures of the Legendary Baron Munchausen\" in 1979, and followed it with a 1984 sequel, \"Moon Madness\". Oleg Yankovsky appeared as the Baron in the 1979 Russian television film \"The Very Same Munchhausen\", directed by Mark Zakharov from Grigori Gorin's screenplay, produced and released by Mosfilm. The film, a satirical commentary on Soviet censorship and social mores, imagines an ostracized Baron attempting to prove the truth of his adventures in a disbelieving and conformity-driven world.\n\nIn 1988, Terry Gilliam adapted the Raspe stories into a lavish Hollywood film, \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\", with the British stage actor and director John Neville in the lead. Roger Ebert, in his review of the film, described Neville's Baron as a man who \"seems sensible and matter-of-fact, as anyone would if they had spent a lifetime growing accustomed to the incredible\". The German actor Jan Josef Liefers starred in a 2012 two-part television film titled \"Baron Münchhausen\"; according to a \"Spiegel Online\" review, his characterization of the Baron strongly resembled Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film series.\n\nIn 2004, a fan club calling itself Munchausen's Grandchildren was founded in the Russian city of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg). The club's early activities included identifying \"historical proofs\" of the fictional Baron's travels through Königsberg, such as a jackboot supposedly belonging to the Baron and a sperm whale skeleton said to be that of the whale in whose belly the Baron was trapped.\n\nOn 18 June 2005, to celebrate the 750th anniversary of Kaliningrad, a monument to the Baron was unveiled as a gift from Bodenwerder, portraying the Baron's cannonball ride. Bodenwerder sports a Munchausen monument in front of its Town Hall, as well a Munchausen museum including a large collection of illustrated editions of the stories. Another Munchausen Museum (\"Minhauzena Muzejs\") exists in Duntes Muiža, Liepupe parish, Latvia, home of the real Baron's first wife; the couple had lived in the town for six years, before moving back to the baronial estate in Hanover. In 2005, to mark the real-life Baron's 285th birthday, the National Bank of Latvia issued a commemorative silver coin.\n\nIn 1951, the British physician Richard Asher published an article in \"The Lancet\" describing patients whose factitious disorders led them to lie about their own states of health. Asher proposed to call the disorder \"Munchausen's syndrome\", commenting: \"Like the famous Baron von Munchausen, the persons affected have always travelled widely; and their stories, like those attributed to him, are both dramatic and untruthful. Accordingly, the syndrome is respectfully dedicated to the baron, and named after him\". The disease is now usually referred to as Munchausen syndrome. The name has spawned two other coinages: Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which illness is feigned by caretakers rather than patients, and Munchausen by Internet, in which illness is feigned online.\n\nIn 1968, Hans Albert coined the term \"Münchhausen trilemma\" to describe the philosophical problem inherent in having to derive conclusions from premises; those premises have to be derived from still other premises, and so on forever, leading to an infinite regress interruptible only by circular logic or dogmatism. The problem is named after the similarly paradoxical story in which the Baron saves himself from being drowned in a swamp by pulling on his own hair. The same story also inspired the mathematical term \"Munchausen number\", coined by Daan van Berkel in 2009 to describe numbers whose digits, when raised to their own powers, can be added together to form the number itself (for example, 3435 = 3 + 4 + 3 + 5).\n\nSubclass ATU1889 of the Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification system, a standard index of folklore, was named \"Münchhausen Tales\" in tribute to the stories. In 1994, a main belt asteroid was named 14014 Münchhausen in honor of both the real and the fictional Baron.\n\n"}
{"id": "2493017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2493017", "title": "Benjamin Franklin Parkway", "text": "Benjamin Franklin Parkway\n\nBenjamin Franklin Parkway, commonly abbreviated to Ben Franklin Parkway, is a scenic boulevard that runs through the cultural heart of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Named for Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, the mile-long Parkway cuts diagonally across the grid plan pattern of Center City's Northwest quadrant. It starts at Philadelphia City Hall, curves around Logan Circle, and ends before the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nThe Parkway is the spine of Philadelphia's Museum District. Some of the city's most famous sights are here: Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul; Swann Memorial Fountain; Parkway Central Library, the Family Court Building, the Franklin Institute, Moore College of Art and Design, the Academy of Natural Sciences, the Rodin Museum, Eakins Oval, the Barnes Foundation and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. From its northern end, the Parkway provides access to Fairmount Park through Kelly Drive (formerly East River Drive), Martin Luther King Drive (formerly West River Drive), the Schuylkill River Trail, and the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76).\n\nThe Parkway also is an outdoor sculpture garden. Works include: \"The Thinker\" by Auguste Rodin; \"Gates of Hell\" also by Rodin; \"LOVE\" by Robert Indiana; \"The Ideal Scout\" by Robert Tait McKenzie; \"Three-Way Piece\" by Henry Moore; the three River figures in the Swann Memorial Fountain by Alexander Stirling Calder; \"Shakespeare Memorial\" also by Calder; \"Philadelphia Holocaust Memorial\" by Nathan Rapoport; \"Joseph Leidy\" by Samuel Murray; \"Aero Memorial\" by Paul Manship; \"General Galusha Pennypacker\" by Charles Grafly and Albert Laessle; \"Jesus Breaking Bread\" by Walter Erlebacher, \"All Wars Colored Soldiers and Sailors Memorial\" by J. Otto Schweizer; \"Thaddeus Kosciuszko\" by Robert Aitken; \"Civil War Soldiers and Sailors Memorial\" by Hermon Atkins MacNeil; \"Kopernik\" by Dudley Vaill Talcott; \"Joan of Arc\" by Emmanuel Fremiet; Washington Monument by Rudolf Siemering; and the \"Rocky\" statue by A. Thomas Schomberg.\n\nIn a city famous for its urban planning, the Parkway represents one of the earliest examples of urban renewal in the United States. The road was constructed to ease heavy industrial congestion in Center City and to restore Philadelphia's natural and artistic beauty, as part of the City Beautiful movement.\n\nPreliminary proposals for the Parkway had been produced and added to the City Plan by 1906, but the first comprehensive plan for the Parkway was commissioned in 1907 by the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art). The Association commissioned architects Horace Trumbauer, Clarence Zantzinger, and Paul Philippe Cret, who created a detailed parkway design that was formally added to the City Plan in 1909. Construction on the Parkway did not begin until 1917, when French landscape architect Jacques Gréber submitted a revised plan to the Commissioners of Fairmount Park. \n\nGréber designed the Parkway in 1917 to emulate the Champs-Élysées in Paris, France. The route was determined by an axis drawn from City Hall Tower to a fixed point on the hill that William Penn called \"Fairmount\", now the site of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The Champs-Élysées terminates at the Arc de Triomphe, and the Parkway's terminating at the Art Museum gives the notion of \"a slice of Paris in Philadelphia.\" The Parkway also has an international flavor by being lined with flags of countries from around the world. \n\nThe traffic rotary on the western end of the Parkway, at the foot of the Art Museum's Rocky Steps, is named Eakins Oval after Philadelphia painter Thomas Eakins. The traffic lanes around Eakins Oval originally formed a regular oval; this pattern was modified in the early 1960s to its present elongated circular shape, with the truncated lanes serving as staging areas for various events.\n\nBecause of its central location, the Parkway is the site for many concerts and parades. On July 2, 2005, the steps of the museum played host to the Philadelphia venue of Live 8, where artists such as Dave Matthews Band, Linkin Park and Maroon 5 performed. The Parkway was also the site of Jay-Z's Made in America Festival on September 1-2, 2012 featuring Jay-Z, Pearl Jam, Skrillex and Calvin Harris, among others. On September 26th and 27th, 2015, Pope Francis visited Philadelphia and the Parkway was flooded with over a million visitors both weekend days, a Celebration of Families on Saturday, and a Holy Mass on Sunday.\n\nIn recent years, there has been concern that the original plan of a wide, multi-sectioned, multi-laned, tree-lined boulevard, while beautiful to travel on, is not very engaging for pedestrian or other public use. Traffic along the Parkway has decreased considerably because of the completion of Interstate 676 (Vine Street Expressway), linking the Schuylkill Expressway with the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. In response, the roadway has been narrowed somewhat and the sidewalks expanded around Logan Circle. Various plans for the rest of the Parkway, some of which would insert shops and other smaller structures into the long stretches between museums, have been proposed, but none so far have been thought feasible or financially sound.\n\nA new museum for the Barnes Foundation collection of Impressionist art on the site between the Free Library and the Rodin Museum opened in Spring 2012.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6255487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6255487", "title": "Bohemian style", "text": "Bohemian style\n\nIn modern use, the term \"Bohemian\" is applied to people who live unconventional, usually artistic, lives. The adherents of the \"Bloomsbury Group\", which formed around the Stephen sisters, Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf in the early 20th century, are among the best-known examples. The original \"Bohemians\" were travellers or refugees from central Europe (hence, the French \"bohémien\", for \"gypsy\").\n\nReflecting on the fashion style of \"boho-chic\" in the early years of the 21st century, the \"Sunday Times\" thought it ironic that \"fashionable girls wore ruffly floral skirts in the hope of looking bohemian, nomadic, spirited and non-bourgeois\", whereas \"gypsy girls themselves ... are sexy and delightful precisely because they do not give a hoot for fashion\". By contrast, in the late 19th century and first half of the 20th, aspects of Bohemian fashion reflected the lifestyle itself.\n\nThe bohemian sub-culture has been closely connected with predominantly male artists and intellectuals. The female counterparts have been closely connected with the so called Grisettes,young women who combined part-time prostitution with various other occupations. In the first quarter of the 19th century, the term Grisette also came to refer more specifically to the independent young women. These, often working as seamstresses or milliner's assistants as well frequented bohemian artistic and cultural venues in Paris. Many grisettes worked as artist's models, often providing sexual favours to the artists in addition to posing for them. During the time of King Louis-Philippe they came to dominate the bohemian modelling scene.\n\n\"Art is the grand excuse for all actions that are beyond vulgar. It is art that purifies everything, even a poor young woman's submission of her body.\"The grisette became a frequent character in French fiction but have been mentioned as early as in 1730 by Jonathan Swift. The term, compare The grisette in poetry, signifies qualities of both flirtatiousness and intellectual aspiration, George du Maurier based large parts of \"Trilby\" on his experiences as a student in Parisian bohemia during the 1850s. Poe's 1842 story was based on the unsolved murder of Mary Cecilia Rogers near New York City, subtitled \"A Sequel to 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue'\", it was the first detective story to attempt the solution of a real crime. The most enduring grisette is Mimi in Henri Murger’s novel (and subsequent play) \"Scènes de la vie de Bohème\", the source for Puccini's famous opera \"La bohème.\"\n\nIn 1848 William Makepeace Thackeray used the word \"bohemianism\" in his novel \"Vanity Fair\". In 1862, the \"Westminster Review\" described a Bohemian as \"simply an artist or \"littérateur\" who, consciously or unconsciously, secedes from conventionality in life and in art\". During the 1860s the term was associated in particular with the pre-Raphaelite movement, the group of artists and aesthetes of which Dante Gabriel Rossetti was the most prominent:\n\nAs the 1860s progressed, Rossetti would become the grand prince of bohemianism as his deviations from normal standards became more audacious. And as he became this epitome of the unconventional, his egocentric demands necessarily required his close friends to remodel their own lives around him. His bohemianism was like a web in which others became trapped – none more so than William and Jane Morris.\n\nJane Morris, who was to become Rossetti's muse, epitomised, probably more than any of the women associated with the pre-Raphaelites, an unrestricted, flowing style of dress that, while unconventional at the time, would be highly influential at certain periods during the 20th century. She and others, including the much less outlandish Georgiana Burne-Jones (wife of Edward Burne-Jones, one of the later pre-Raphaelites), eschewed the corsets and crinolines of the mid-to-late Victorian era, a feature that impressed the American writer Henry James when he wrote to his sister in 1869 of the bohemian atmosphere of the Morrises’ house in the Bloomsbury district of London and, in particular, the \"dark silent medieval\" presence of its chateleine:\n\nIt’s hard to say whether she’s a grand synthesis of all the pre-Raphaelite pictures ever made … whether she’s an original or a copy. In either case she’s a wonder. Imagine a tall lean woman in a long dress of some dead purple stuff, guiltless of hoops (or of anything else I should say) with a mass of crisp black hair heaped into great wavy projections on each of her temples … a long neck, without any collar, and \"in lieu\" thereof some dozen strings of outlandish beads.\n\nIn his play \"Pygmalion\" (1912) Bernard Shaw unmistakably based the part of Mrs. Higgins on the then elderly Jane Morris. Describing Mrs. Higgins' drawing room, he referred to a portrait of her \"when she defied the fashion of her youth in one of the beautiful Rossettian costumes which, when caricatured by people who did not understand, led to the absurdities of popular estheticism \"[sic]\" in the eighteen-seventies\".\n\nA biographer of Edward Burne-Jones, writing a century after Shaw (Fiona MacCarthy, 2011), has noted that, in 1964, when the influential Biba store was opened in London by Barbara Hulanicki, the \"long drooping structureless clothes\", though sexier than the dresses portrayed in such Burne-Jones paintings as \"The Golden Stairs\" or \"The Sirens\", nevertheless resembled them. The interior of Biba has been described by the biographer of British 20th century designer Laura Ashley as having an atmosphere that \"reeked of sex ... [It] was designed to look like a bordello with its scarlet, black and gold plush fitments, but, interestingly, it implied an old-fashioned, Edwardian style of forbidden sex with its feather boas, potted palms, bentwood coat racks and dark lighting\" MacCarthy observed also that \"the androgynous appearance of Burne-Jones's male figures reflected the sexually ambivalent feeling\" of the late 1960s.\n\nEffie Gray, whose marriage to John Ruskin was annulled in 1854 prior to her marrying the pre-Raphaelite painter John Millais, is known to have used flowers as an adornment and probably also as an assertive \"statement\". While in Scotland with Ruskin (still her husband) and Millais, she gathered foxgloves to place in her hair. She wore them at breakfast despite being asked by her husband not to do so, a gesture of defiance, at a time of growing crisis in their relationship, that came to the critical notice of Florence Nightingale (who tended to regard others of her sex with \"scarcely concealed scorn\" and was generally unsympathetic to \"women's rights\"). A few weeks earlier, on Midsummer Day, Effie (possibly inspired by Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\") was said by her hostess, Pauline Trevelyan, to have \"looked lovely\" with stephanotis in her hair at an evening party in Northumberland, while, the previous year, a male friend had brought glass flowers for her hair from Venice. Ruskin's father was evidently shocked to learn that, when Effie herself was in Venice, she had removed her bonnet in public, ostensibly because of the heat.\n\nIn 1853 Millais painted \"Effie with Foxgloves in her Hair\" which depicts her wearing the flowers while doing needlework. Other paintings of the mid-to-late 19th century, such as Frederick Sandys' \"Love's Shadow\" (1867) of a girl with a rose in her hair, sucking a sprig of blossom, which was described in 1970 as \"a first rate PR job for the Flower People\", and Burne-Jones' \"The Heart of the Rose\" (1889), have been cited as foreshadowing the \"flower power\" of the mid-to-late 1960s.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, an increasing number of professional women, notably in America, were attempting to live outside the traditional parameters of society. Between 1870 and 1910 the marriage rate among educated women in the United States fell to 60% (30% lower than the national average), while, by 1893, in the state of Massachusetts alone, some 300,000 women were earning their own living in nearly 300 occupations. The invention of the typewriter in 1867 was a particular spur: for example, by the turn of the 20th century, 80% of stenographers were women.\n\nBy this time, such movements as the Rational Dress Society (1881), with which the Morrises and Georgiana Burne-Jones were involved, were beginning to exercise some influence on women's dress, although the pre-Raphaelite look was still considered \"advanced\" in the late years of the 19th century. Queen Victoria's precocious daughter Princess Louise, an accomplished painter and artist who mixed in bohemian circles, was sympathetic to rational dress and to the developing women's movement generally (although her rumoured pregnancy at the age of 18 was said to have been disguised by tight corsetry).\nHowever, it was not really until the First World War that \"many working women ... embarked on a revolution in fashion that greatly reduced the weight and restrictions imposed on them by their clothing\". Some women working in factories wore trousers and the brassiere (invented in 1889 by the feminist Herminie Cadolle and patented in America by Mary Phelps Jacob in 1914) began gradually to supersede the corset. In shipyards \"trouser suits\" (the term, \"pantsuit\" was adopted in America in the 1920s) were virtually essential to enable women to shin up and down ladders. Music hall artists also helped to push the boundaries of fashion; these included Vesta Tilley, whose daring adoption on stage of well tailored male dress not only had an influence on men's attire, but also foreshadowed to an extent styles adopted by some women in the inter-war period. It was widely understood that Tilley sought additional authenticity by wearing male underclothing, although off stage she was much more conventional in both her dress and general outlook.\n\nBy the early 1920s, what had been a wartime expedient – the need to economise on material – had become a statement of freedom by young women, manifested by shorter hemlines (just above the knee by 1925–6) and boyish hairstyles, accompanied by what Robert Graves and Alan Hodge described as \"the new fantastic development of Jazz music\". At the Antwerp Olympic Games in 1920 the French tennis player Suzanne Lenglen attracted attention with a knee length skirt that revealed her suspender belt whenever she leapt to smash a ball. From then on, sportwear for women, as with day-to-day clothes, became freer, although, after the Second World War, when the American player Gussie Moran appeared at the Wimbledon championships of 1949 in a short skirt that revealed lace-trimmed panties, the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club accused her of bringing \"vulgarity and sin into tennis\" and shunned the outfit's designer Teddy Tinling for many years.\n\nThe \"Penguin Social History of Britain\" noted that \"by the 1920s newspapers were filled with advertisements for 'lingerie' and 'undies' which would have been classed as indecent a generation earlier\". Thus, in Ben Travers' comic novel \"Rookery Nook\" (1923), a young woman evicted from home in her nightwear and requiring day clothes remarked, \"Combies. That's all right. But in the summer you know, we don't ...\", while in Agatha Christie's thriller, \"The Seven Dials Mystery\" (1929), the aristocratic heroine, Lady \"Bundle\" Brent, wore only \"a negligible trifle\" under her dress; like many real life \"it girls\" of her class, she had been freed from the \"genteel expectations\" of earlier generations. In Hollywood the actress Carole Lombard, who, in the 1930s, combined feistiness with sexual allure, never wore a brassière and \"avoided panties\". However, she famously declared that though \"I live by a man's code designed to fit a man's world ... at the same time I never forget that a woman's first job is to choose the right shade of lipstick\" Coincidentally, sales of men's undershirts fell dramatically in the United States when Lombard's future husband, Clark Gable, was revealed not to be wearing one in a famous motel bedroom scene with Claudette Colbert in the film \"It Happened One Night\" (1934). According to Gable, \"the idea was looking half-naked and scaring the brat into her own bed on the other side of the blanket [hanging from a clothesline to separate twin beds]\". However, he \"gave the impression that going without was a vital sign of a man's virility\" More generally, the adoption by the American movie industry of the Hays Production Code in the early 1930s had a significant effect on how moral, and especially sexual, issues were depicted on film. This included a more conservative approach to matters of dress. Whereas the sort of scanty lingerie on show in some earlier productions (for example, Joan Blondell and Barbara Stanwyck in \"Night Nurse\", 1931) had tended to reflect trends that, in the 1920s, defied convention and were regarded many young women as liberating, by the early years of the Depression such displays came to be regarded quite widely as undesirable. Developments in the late 1960s and 70s, when the strictures of the code were abandoned, followed a similar pattern, although, by then, it was often women themselves who were in the vanguard of resistance to sexualised imagery.\n\nLooking back at this period, Graves and Hodge noted the protracted course that \"daring female fashions had always taken ... from brothel to stage, then on to Bohemia, to Society, to Society's maids, to the mill-girl and lastly to the suburban woman\".\n\nAmong female Bohemians in the early 20th century, the \"gypsy look\" was a recurring theme, popularised by, among others, Dorothy \"Dorelia\" McNeill (1881–1969), muse, lover and second wife of the painter Augustus John (1878–1961), whose full skirts and bright colours gave rise to the so-called \"Dorelia look\". Katherine Everett, \"née\" Olive, a former student of the Slade School of Art in London, has described McNeil's \"tight fitting, hand-sewn, canary coloured bodice above a dark gathered flowing skirt, and her hair very black and gleaming, emphasiz[ing] the long silver earrings which were her only adornment\".\n\nEverett recalled also the Johns' woods \"with wild cherry trees in blossom, and ... a model with flying red hair, clad in white, being chased in and out of the trees by nude children\". With similar lack of inhibition, as early as 1907 the American heiress Natalie Barney (1875–1972) was leading like-minded women in sapphic dances in her Parisian garden, photographs of which look little different from scenes at Woodstock in 1969 and other \"pop\" festivals of the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nBy contrast, short bobbed hair was often a Bohemian trait, having originated in Paris \"c.\"1909 and been adopted by students at the Slade several years before American film actresses such as Colleen Moore and Louise Brooks (\"the girl in the black helmet\") became associated with it in the mid-1920s. This style was plainly discernible on a woodblock self-portrait of 1916 by Dora Carrington, who had entered the Slade in 1910, and, indeed, the journalist and historian Sir Max Hastings has referred to \"poling punts occupied by reclining girls with bobbed hair\" as an enduring, if misleading, popular image of the \"idyll before the storm\" of the First World War.\n\nIn F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story, \"Bernice Bobs Her Hair\" (1920), a young woman who wishes to become a \"society vamp\" regards the adoption of a bob as a necessary prelude, while Louise Brooks' sexually charged performance as Lulu in G. W. Pabst's film, \"Pandora's Box\" (1929), left an enduring image of the style, which has been replicated on screen over the years, most vividly by Cyd Charisse in \"Singin' in the Rain\" (1952), Isabelle de Funès as Valentina in \"Baba Yaga\" (1973) and Melanie Griffith in \"Something Wild\" (1986). It was associated also with many popular singers and actresses in the 1960s and has frequently been evoked by writers and directors, as well as fashion designers, seeking to recapture the hedonsitic or free spirit of the 1920s. For example, Kerry Greenwood's \"Cocaine Blues\" (1989) and succeeding novels about Phryne Fisher, a glamorous, but unconventional aristocratic investigator in late twenties Melbourne, Australia, conveyed an image – \"five feet two [157.5 centimetres] with eyes of green and black hair cut into a cap\" – that was later cultivated stylishly on television by Essie Davis in ABC's \"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries\" (2012).\n\nAround 1926 an even shorter style, known as the \"Eton crop\", became popular: on her arrival in Tilling (Rye) in E F Benson's comic novel \"Mapp and Lucia\" (1931), Lucia described \"Quaint\" Irene as \"a girl with no hat and an Eton crop. She was dressed in a fisherman's jersey and knickerbockers\". (In the same book, Miss Mapp frequently – and topically – addressed Lucia, to her irritation, as \"Lulu\".) For many years trite assumptions were often made about the sexuality of women with cropped hairstyles; an historian of the 1980s wrote of the Greenham Common \"peace camp\" in England that it \"brought public awareness to feminist separation and even to lesbianism, hitherto seen in the mass media – when acknowledged at all – either in terms of Eton-cropped androgyny or of pornographic fantasy\". Even so, others have drawn a stark contrast between the bohemian demeanour of the Greenham women and the \"bold make-up and power-dressing\" that tended to define women's fashion more generally in the 1980s (the so-called \"designer decade\").\n\nOne social historian has observed that \"the innocuous woollen jersey, now known [in Britain] as the jumper or the pullover, was the first item of clothing to become interchangeable between men and women and, as such, was seen as a dangerous symptom of gender confusion\". Trousers for women, sometimes worn mannishly as an expression of sexuality (as by Marlene Dietrich as a cabaret singer in the 1930 film, \"Morocco\", in which she dressed in a white tie suit and kissed a girl in the audience) also became popular in the 1920s and 1930s, as did aspects of what many years later would sometimes be referred to as \"shabby chic\". Winston Churchill's niece Clarissa was among those who wore a tailored suit in the late 1930s.\n\nAfter the Second World War Christian Dior's \"New Look\", launched in Paris in 1947, though drawing on styles that had begun to emerge in 1938-9, set the pattern for women's fashion generally until the 1960s. Harking back in some ways to the \"Belle Epoque\" of the late 19th and early 20th centuries – and thus not a \"new\" look as such (by early 1948, it was simply known as \"The Look\" in America) – it was criticised by some as excessively feminine and, with its accompanying corsets and rustle of frilled petticoats, as setting back the \"work of emancipation won through participation in two world wars\". It also, for a while, bucked the trend towards boyish fashion that, as after the First World War, tended to follow major conflicts.\n\nAmerican influences had been discouraged during the Nazi occupation of France, but, notably in the form of be-bop and other types of jazz, were strong among intellectual café society in the mid-to-late 1940s. In 1947, \"Samedi-Soir\" lifted the lid on what it called the \"troglodytes of Saint-Germain\", namely bohemians of the Parisian Left Bank (\"Rive Gauche\") district of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, who appeared to cluster around existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. These included Roger Vadim (who married and launched the career of actress Brigitte Bardot in the 1950s), novelist Boris Vian (since described as \"the epitome of Left Bank bohemia, standing at the center of its postwar rehabilitation\") and singer Juliette Gréco.\nAt the liberation of Paris in 1944, the American journalist Ernie Pyle observed that the women were all \"brightly dressed in white or red blouses and colourful peasant skirts, with flowers in their hair and big flashy earrings.\" while Lady Diana Cooper, whose husband, Duff Cooper, became British Ambassador to Paris that year, wrote that, during the occupation, Parisienne women had worn \"grotesquely large hats hung with flowers and fruits and feathers and ribbons\" as well as high carved wooden shoes. However, in contrast to such striking bohemian adornments and subsequently the \"New Look\" (which itself scandalised some Parisennes), the clothes of the post-war bohemians were predominantly black: when Gréco first performed outside Saint-Germain she affronted some of her audience by wearing \"black trousers, her bare feet slipped into golden sandals\". In old age she claimed that this style of dress arose from poverty:\n\nWhen I was a teenager in Paris ... I only had one dress and one pair of shoes, so the boys in the house started dressing me in their old black coats and trousers. A fashion was shaped out of misery. When people copied me I found it a little ridiculous, but I didn't mind. It made me smile.\n\nPerforming in London over fifty years later, Gréco was described as \"still ooz[ing] bohemian style\".\n\nCapturing the spirit of the time, David Profumo has written of how his mother, the actress Valerie Hobson, was entranced by Roger Vadim's flatmate, the director Marc Allégret, while she was filming \"Blanche Fury\" in 1947:\n\nAllégret's apparently bohemian lifestyle appealed sharply to her romantic side ... and she revelled in the Left Bank milieu to which he introduced her during script discussions in Paris. There were meals with André Gide, Jean Cocteau and the long-legged Zizi Jeanmaire. For an attractive British woman who felt deprived of attention ... this was an ideal situation for some sort of reawakening.\n\nThe previous year a perfume created for Hobson had been marketed as \"Great Expectations\" to coincide with her role as Estella Havisham in David Lean's film of that name, based on Charles Dickens' 1861 novel. In England, this attracted the custom of then-Oxford University undergraduate Margaret Roberts, later British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who, a little daringly for the time, also shopped for \"push-up\" pink brassieres. In 1953, when Hobson starred in the musical \"The King and I\" in London, it was apparent that she had retained a Parisienne mix of \"chic\" and Boheminism. A \"Daily Mirror\" journalist described her \"pale, ladylike looks, her well-bred clothes ... she likes embroidery and painting\", while a young Etonian who visited her dressing room recalled that \"it had been freshly painted pink and white for her, and was like entering a risqué French apartment\". Ten years later, when Hobson's husband, the politician John Profumo, was involved in a sex scandal that threatened to destabilise the British government, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote that \"his [Profumo's] wife is very nice and sensible. Of course, these people live in a raffish, theatrical, bohemian society where no one really knows anyone and everyone is \"darling\"\".\n\nPost-war Paris was recalled fondly in 2007 when France introduced a ban on smoking in public places. The aroma of Gauloises and Gitanes was, for many years, thought to be an inseparable feature of Parisian café society, but the owner of Les Deux Magots, once frequented by Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus and other writers, observed that \"things have changed. The writers of today are not so addicted to cigarettes\". A British journalist who interviewed Juliette Gréco in 2010 described Les Deux Magots and the Café de Flore as \"now overpriced tourist hotspots\" and noted that \"chain stores and expensive restaurants have replaced the bookshops, cafés and revolutionary ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir's Rive Gauche\". As measures of changing attitudes to cuisine and fashion, by the early 21st century 80% of French croissants were being made in food plants, while, by 2014, only one factory continued to manufacture the traditional male beret associated with printers, artists, political activists and, during the inter-war years, the tennis player Jean Borotra.\n\nThe bohemian traits of post-war Paris spread to other urban parts of the French-speaking world, notably to Algiers, where an underground culture of \"jazz clubs, girls and drugs\" grew up - in the words of punk rock producer Marc Zermati, who was in the city at the height of the Algerian war in the late 1950s, \"all very French\". However, that war marked a turning point which, in the view of some, was so traumatic that \"ordinary French people\" looked instead to America as \"a new model for pleasure and happiness\". This, in turn, led to the \"ye-ye\" music of the early to mid 1960s (named after the British band, the Beatles' use of \"yeah, yeah\" in some their early songs) and the rise of such singers as Johnny Halliday and Françoise Hardy. The French also adopted a number of British singers (Petula Clark, Gillian Hills, Jane Birkin) who performed successfully in French, Birkin forming a long-term relationship with singer/songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, who was a seminal figure in French popular music in the 1960s and 70s. In 1968 major industrial and student unrest in Paris and other parts of France came close to ousting the government of President Charles de Gaulle, who, after leading the Free French during the Second World War, had returned to power at the time of the Algerian emergency. The events of 1968 represented a further significant landmark in post-war France, although their longer term impact was probably more on cultural, social and academic life than on the political system, which, through the constitution of the Fifth Republic (1958), has remained broadly intact. Indeed, one paradox of 1968 was that the first student demonstrations broke out at Nanterre, whose catchment area included the affluent and \"chic\" 16th and 17th \"arrondissements\" of Paris. Its students were more modish and \"trendy\" than those of the Sorbonne in the city's Latin Quarter, being described at the time in terms that typify more generally the styles and attitudes of young people the late 1960s:\n\nIt is the girls that give the show away - culottes, glossy leather, mini-skirts, boots - driving up in Mini-Coopers ... Rebellious sentiment is more obvious among the boys: long hair, square spectacles, Che Guevara [Cuban revolutionary, died 1967] beards. The picture in Nanterre in May was lots and lots of painted dollies cohabiting with unkempt revolutionaries.\n\nIn the United States adherents of the \"beat\" counter-culture (probably best defined by Jack Kerouac's novel, \"On the Road\", set in the late 1940s, written in 1952 and published in 1957) were associated with black polo-neck (or turtle neck) sweaters, blue denim jeans and sandals. The influence of this movement could be seen in the persona and songs of Bob Dylan in the early to mid-1960s, \"road\" films like \"Easy Rider\" (1969) and the punk-oriented \"New Wave\" of the mid-1970s, which, among other things, produced a boho style icon in Deborah Harry of the New York band Blondie, whom photographer David LaChapelle has described as \"the definition of cool\". (However, as with some American musicians of the mid-1960s, such as Sonny and Cher, Blondie came to international prominence only after a tour of Britain in 1978.)\n\nNew York's Greenwich Village, which, since the late 19th century, had attracted many women with feminist or \"free love\" ideals, was a particular magnet for bohemians in the early 1960s. Bob Dylan's girl-friend Suze Rotolo, who appeared with him on the cover of his second album \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\" (1963), recalled that the Village was \"where people like me went – people who didn't belong where they came from .. where the writers I was reading and the artists I was looking at had lived or passed through\". These \"beatniks\" (as they came to be known by the late 1950s) were, in many ways, the antecedents of the hippie movement that formed on the West Coast of the USA in the mid-1960s and came to the fore as the first post-war baby-boomers reached the age of majority in the \"Summer of Love\" of 1967. The Monterey Pop Festival was a major landmark of that year, which was associated with \"flowerpower\", psychedelia, opposition to the Vietnam war and the inventive music and flowing, colourful fashions of, among others, Jimi Hendrix, the Mamas & the Papas, Jefferson Airplane and the British group, The Beatles, whose album, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", is said to have caused the guru of psychedelia, Timothy Leary, to remark that \"my work is finished\".\n\nThe documentary film, \"Festival\" (Murray Lerner, 1967), recorded how the \"clean-cut college kids\" who attended the Newport (Rhode Island) Folk Festival in 1963-4 had, by 1965 (when Bob Dylan caused a sensation at that year's festival by playing an electric guitar), become \"considerably scruffier\": \"the hippies were waiting to be born\". Among other things, the wearing of male neckties, which, in the mid-1960s, had often drawn on 19th century paisley patterns, declined as muttonchop whiskers and teashades (sunglasses) came in: by the time of the Chicago 7 trial (late 1969), hair over the collars had become so commonplace that it was beginning to transcend Bohemian style, taking on mass popularity in the 1970s. The London art dealer Jeremy Maas reflected in the mid-1980s that\n\nthere [was] no question that the Hippy \"[sic]\" movement and its repercussive influence in England owed much of its imagery, its manner, dress and personal appearance to the Pre-Raphaelite ideal ... It was observed by all of us who were involved with these exhibitions [of pre-Raphaelite paintings] that visitors included increasing numbers of the younger generation, who had begun to resemble the figures in the pictures they had come to see.\n\nJimmy Page of the British band Led Zeppelin, who collected Pre-Raphaelite paintings, observed of Edward Burne-Jones that \"the romance of the Arthurian legends [captured in his paintings] and the bohemian life of the artists who were reworking these stories seemed very attuned to our time\", while the author David Waller noted in 2011 that Burne-Jones' subjects \"have much in common with the sixties rock chicks and their pop-star paladins\".\n\nAlthough the annual \"Saturday Book\" recorded in 1956 a view that \"London's now nothing but flash coffee bars, with teddies and little bits of girls in jeans\", the \"Edwardian\" (\"teddy boy\") look of the times did not coincide with Bohemian tastes. For women, the legacy of the \"New Look\" was still apparent, although hemlines had generally risen as, as one journalist put it in 1963, \"photographs of those first bold bearers of the New Look make them seem strangely lost and bewildered, as though they had mistaken their cue and come on stage fifty years late\". The Bohemian foci during this period were the jazz clubs and espresso bars of Soho and Fitzrovia. Their habitués usually wore polo necks; in the words of one social historian, “thousands of pale, duffel-coat-clad students were hunched in coffee bars over their copies of Jean-Paul Sartre and Jack Kerouac”. Various public houses and clubs also catered for Bohemian tastes, notably the Colony Room Club in Soho, opened in 1948 by Muriel Belcher, a lesbian from Birmingham. As with the literary phenomenon of the so-called \"Angry Young Men\" from 1956 onwards, the image was more a male, than a female, one. However, when the singer Alma Cogan wished to mark her success by buying mink coats for her mother and sister, the actress Sandra Caron, the latter asked for a duffel-coat instead because she wanted to be regarded as a serious actress and \"a sort of a beatnik\". In 1960 the future author Jacqueline Wilson, who, as a teenager, lived in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, captured this look after spotting two acquaintances in a record shop \"in turquoise duffle coats, extremely tight jeans and cha-cha shoes being cuddled by a group of horrible spotty teddy boys\".\n\nIn Iris Murdoch's novel, \"The Bell\" (1958), an art student named Dora Greenfield bought \"big multi-coloured skirts and jazz records and sandals\". However, as Britain emerged from post-war austerity, some Bohemian women found influences from continental Europe, adopting, for example, the \"gamine look\", with its black jerseys and short, almost boyish hairstyles associated with film actresses Audrey Hepburn (\"Sabrina\", 1954, and as a \"Gréco beatnik\" in \"Funny Face\", 1957) and Jean Seberg (\"Bonjour Tristesse\", 1957 and \"A bout de souffle\", 1960), as well as the French novelist Françoise Sagan, who, as one critic put it, \"was celebrated for the variety of her partners and for driving fast sports cars in bare feet as an example of the free life\". In 1961 Fenella Fielding played \"a mascara-clad Gréco-alike\" in \"The Rebel\" with comedian Tony Hancock, while, more recently, Talulah Riley replicated the look for scenes in ITV's 2006 adaptation of Agatha Christie's \"The Moving Finger\", set in 1951.\n\nOthers favoured the lower-cut, tighter styles of continental stars such as Bardot or Gina Lollobrigida. Valerie Hobson was among those whose wardrobe drew on Italian \"couture\"; in addition to a large collection of stiletto heeled shoes, she possessed a skirt made from python skin. More generally, European tastes – including the Lambretta motor scooter and Italian and French cuisine, which the widely travelled cookery writer Elizabeth David, herself a bit of a Bohemian, did much to promote – not only began to pervade Bohemian circles, but offered a contrast, from 1955 onwards, with the brasher Americanism of rock 'n' roll, with its predominantly teenage associations.\n\nIn 1960, when the Beatles (then an obscure Liverpudlian combo with five members, as opposed to their eventual \"fab\" four) were working in Hamburg, West Germany, they were influenced by a Bohemian \"art school\" set known as \"Exis\" (for \"existentialists\"). The \"Exis\" were roughly equivalent to what in France became known as \"les beats\" and included photographer Astrid Kirchherr (for whom the \"fifth Beatle\" Stuart Sutcliffe left the group) and artist and musician Klaus Voormann (who designed the cover for the Beatles' album \"Revolver\" in 1966).\n\nJohn Lennon's wife Cynthia recalled that Kirchherr was fascinated by the Beatles' \"teddy-boy style\", but that they, in turn, were \"bowled over by her hip black clothes, her \"avant garde\" way of life, her photography and her sense of style\". As a result the group acquired black leather jackets, as well as fringed hairstyles that were the prototype of the \"mop-top\" cuts associated with \"Beatlemania\" in 1963-4. The latter coincided with the revival of the bobbed style for women, promoted in London by hairdresser Vidal Sassoon, initially for actress Nancy Kwan, and adopted by, among others, singers Cilla Black, Billie Davis and, in America, Bev Bivens of We Five and Tammi Terrell, fashion designers Mary Quant and Jean Muir, American actress Barbara Feldon in the TV series \"Get Smart\", and, in the form of a longer bob, Cathy McGowan, who presented the influential British TV pop music show, \"Ready Steady Go!\" (1963-6). However, when longer blonde hair (associated with, among many others, Julie Christie, Samantha Juste, Judy Geeson and a fashion model named Lorna McDonald, who, at the end of each edition of the BBC's \"Dee Time\", jumped into Simon Dee's open E-type Jaguar) came to typify the \"sixties\" look, advertisers turned to the Bohemian world for inspiration: through its use of herbs, Sunsilk shampoo was said to have \"stolen something from the gypsies\".\n\nBeatlemania did not of itself create the apparent iconoclasm of the 1960s; however, as one writer put it, \"just as Noël Coward and Cole Porter reflected the louche, carefree attitude of the [Nineteen] Twenties, so did the Beatles' music capture the rhythm of breaking free experienced by an entire generation of people growing up in the Sixties\". By the middle of the decade, British pop music had stimulated the fashion boom of what \"Time\" called “swinging London”. Associated initially with such \"mod\" designs as Quant's mini-skirt, this soon embraced a range of essentially Bohemian styles. These included the military and Victorian fashions popularised by stars who frequented boutiques such as Granny Takes a Trip, the \"fusion of fashion, art and lifestyle\" opened by Nigel Waymouth in the King's Road, Chelsea in January 1966, and, by 1967, the hippie look largely imported from America (although, as noted, London stores such as Biba had, for some time, displayed dresses that drew on Pre-Raphaelite imagery). The Rolling Stones' Keith Richards, whose early girl friend, Linda Keith, had, in her late teens, been a bohemian force in West Hampstead, noted on the Stones' return from an American tour in 1967 how quickly hippiedom had transformed the London scene.\n\nThis fusion of influences was discernible in two black-and-white productions for BBC television in 1966: the series \"Adam Adamant Lives!\", starring Gerald Harper as an Edwardian adventurer who had been cryopreserved in time and Juliet Harmer as Georgina Jones, a stylish \"mod\" who befriended him, and Jonathan Miller's dreamy, rather Gothic production of Lewis Carroll's mid-Victorian children's fantasy \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1865). (Confirming the aspiration, Sydney Newman, the BBC's Head of Television Drama in the 1960s, reflected of \"Adam Adamant\" that \"[they] could never quite get [the] Victorian mentality to contrast with the '60s\".)\n\nOn the face of it, Carroll (a pseudonym for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) had been a rather conventional and repressed Oxford University don, but he was a keen and artistic photographer in the early days of that medium (taking, among other things, rather bohemian looking pictures of Alice Liddell and other young girls) and he developed an empathy and friendship with several of the Pre-Raphaelites; the sculptor Thomas Woolner and possibly even Rossetti dissuaded him from illustrating \"Alice\" himself, a task that was undertaken instead by John Tenniel. The imagery of \"Alice\", both textually and graphically, lent itself well to the psychedelia of the late 1960s. In America, this was apparent in, among other ways, the \"Alice happening\" in Central Park, New York (1968) when naked participants covered themselves in polka dots and the lyrics to Grace Slick's song \"White Rabbit\" (1966) – \"One pill makes you larger/And one pill makes you small\" – that she performed with both the Great Society and Jefferson Airplane, including with the latter at Woodstock in 1969.\n\nBy the late 1960s shops such as Laura Ashley (whose first London outlet opened in 1968) were routinely promoting the \"peasant look\" and selling a range of \"uniquely eccentric clothes ... The magic was being able to step into a 'Laura Ashley' dress and imagine you had found something out of a dressing-up box\". At around the same time too, and into the 1970s, the brassière (or bra), which, as noted, had been seen as a liberating innovation in the early part of the century, came to be regarded by some women, such as the Australian academic Germaine Greer (\"The Female Eunuch\", 1969), as an unduly restrictive symbol of traditional womanhood. However, the much-publicised incidence of \"bra burning\" in the 1970s tended to be overstated and came to be satirised: for example, in the 1973 film, \"Carry On Girls\", and a poster by Young & Rubicam, one of a mildly subversive series for Smirnoff vodka: \"I never thought of burning my bra until I discovered Smirnoff\". It was also seen by many, including Greer herself, as a distraction from the cause of women's \"liberation\". A Vermont lawyer later observed wryly that \"like every good feminist-in-training in the sixties, I burned my bra\", but that \"now it's the nineties ... I realize Playtex [underwear manufacturer] had supported me better than any man I know.\" Claire Perry, who became a Conservative Member of Parliament in 2010 and later a government minister, reflected that, as a \"women's officer\" at Oxford University in the early 1980s, she was \"a bra-burning feminist with a hideous new-romantic haircut\", but that her feminism had, in her view, matured.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, the American singer Madonna had turned the bra into a positive, even provocative, fashion statement. Madonna's flamboyant and gritty style (notably seen to bohemian effect alongside Rosanna Arquette in the 1985 film, \"Desperately Seeking Susan\") was, in turn, a precursor of so-called \"girl power\" that was associated in the 1990s with various prominent young women (such as singers Courtney Love, who played the 1999 Glastonbury Festival in a headline-grabbing pink bra, and the more commercially oriented Spice Girls) and offbeat or quirky American television series (\"\", \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"Caroline in the City\", \"Sex and the City\").\n\nJournalist Bob Stanley remarked that \"the late 1960s are never entirely out of fashion, they just need a fresh angle to make them \"de jour\"\". Thus, the features of hippie fashion re-emerged at various stages during the ensuing forty years.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1980s, variants of the short and fundamentally un-Bohemian rah-rah skirt (which originated with cheerleaders) were combined with leather or demin to create a look with some Bohemian or even gothic features (for example, by the singing duo Strawberry Switchblade who took inspiration from 1970s punk fashion). In the 1990s the term, \"hippie chic\", was applied to Tom Ford’s collections for the Italian house of Gucci. These drew on, among other influences, the style, popular in retrospect, of Talitha Getty (died 1971), actress wife of John Paul Getty and step-granddaughter of Dorelia McNeil, who was represented most famously in a photograph of her and her husband taken by Patrick Lichfield in Marrakesh, Morocco in 1969. Recalling the influx of hippies into Marrakesh in 1968, Richard Neville, then editor of \"Oz\", wrote that \"the dapper drifters in embroidered skirts and cowboy boots were so delighted by the bright satin '50s underwear favoured by the matrons of Marrakesh that they wore them outside their denims à la Madonna [the singer] twenty-five years later\".\n\nIn the early 21st century, \"boho-chic\" was associated initially with supermodel Kate Moss and then, as a highly popular style in 2004-5, with actress Sienna Miller. In America similar styles were sometimes referred to as \"bobo-\" or \"ashcan chic\", or \"luxe grunge\", their leading proponents including actresses Mary-Kate Olsen and Zooey Deschanel. As if to illustrate the cyclical nature of fashion, by the end of the noughties strong pre-Raphaelite traits were notable in, among others, singer Florence Welch, model Karen Elson and designer Anna Sui.\n\nIn Germany, terms like \"Bionade-Bourgeoisie\", \"Bionade-Biedermeier or\" \"Biohème\" refer to former Bohemians that gained a sort of Cultural hegemony with their LOHA lifestyle- The phenomen of such former (young) bohemians becoming establishment during the years is a typical aspect of gentrification processes.

The picture represents a father and son waiting for a train that will take the young man to the state university. The painting, considered by experts to be one of Rockwell's masterworks, is also one of the most widely reproduced, and was voted the second-most popular image in \"Post\" history.\n\nThe details of the picture, as with most of Rockwell's works, combine to tell a story, in this case a story of endings and beginnings, as a boy from New Mexico leaves home for the first time. The young man and his father sit on the running board of the family's stakesided farm truck. The ticket protruding from the son's pocket, and the single rail visible at the lower corner of the painting, by which the trio sit, suggest that they are at a whistle stop waiting for the train.\n\nThe son's books are stacked on a new suitcase bearing a \"State U\" pennant. With his tie and socks perfectly matched, wearing pressed white trousers and matching jacket, he is ready for his new life in college. The young man's shoes are shined to a polished gleam, as, hands folded, and with the family dog resting his head in his lap, his gaze focuses eagerly toward the horizon, and on the next chapter in his life.\n\nIn contrast, the father sits slumped with both his and his son's hats clutched in his hand, as if reluctant to let him go. The direction of his gaze is opposite to his son's. The tag from a Bull Durham tobacco satchel dangles, near at hand, from his shirt pocket. There is a red flag and a lantern at the ready, near his right hand, atop a well-used trunk. With the son's luggage unloaded and waiting next to them, there is nothing left for him to do but signal the train to stop, and his pose suggests that he is looking up the track, dreading the imminent arrival of the train that will carry his son away.\n\nThough the two figures are not looking at each other, the sense of family ties is very strong in this iconic 1954 painting.\n\nThe painting was shown in many locations over many years, including Washington, D.C.'s Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1955, and in Moscow and Cairo in 1964. It was also the inspiration for an eponymous 1987 TV movie, featuring Jason Robards and Doug McKeon as the father and son.\n\nIn 2003, the painting was put on display at the Norman Rockwell Museum, which was its first public showing in over 25 years. Despite some experts noticing discrepancies between the painting on display and the published \"Post\" image, the painting on display was believed to be the original.\n\nIn 1962, the painting had been purchased for $900 by cartoonist Don Trachte, a friend of Rockwell's, and was in his ownership until his death in May 2005. In March 2006, two of his sons found a hidden area in Trachte's house, which contained several paintings, including \"Breaking Home Ties\". Further investigation found that Trachte had created copies of several paintings he owned, and hidden the originals, unknown to his family. Thus, the \"Breaking Home Ties\" that had been put on display at the Norman Rockwell Museum in 2003, was actually a replica. The museum later placed the original on display, along with the replica.\n\nOn November 29, 2006, Sotheby's sold the original painting at auction for $15.4 million, which at the time was a record sum paid for a Rockwell work. The buyer or buyers chose to remain anonymous.\n\n\n"}

The film explores the musical era from the early 1940s to the late 1960s, chronicling the life of the influential Chicago-based record-company executive Leonard Chess, and a few of the musicians who recorded for Chess Records.\n\nThe film stars Adrien Brody as Leonard Chess, Cedric the Entertainer as Willie Dixon, Mos Def as Chuck Berry, Columbus Short as Little Walter, Jeffrey Wright as Muddy Waters, Eamonn Walker as Howlin' Wolf, and Beyoncé as Etta James. The film was released in North America on December 5, 2008 by TriStar Pictures.\n\nIn 1947 in Chicago, a Jewish immigrant from Poland and bar owner Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) hires a blues combo, including guitarist Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) and harmonica player Little Walter (Columbus Short). Waters' and Walter's success leads to Chess opening the doors for black musicians and beginning a new record label in 1950 - Chess Records. This attracts stars like: Etta James (Beyoncé Knowles), Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and Chuck Berry (Mos Def). Inevitably, business and personal lines blur as the sometimes-turbulent lives of the musicians play out. \n\n\nLeonard Chess was the co-founder of the 1950s American record label Chess Records, located in Chicago, Illinois. He ran the legendary company with his brother, Phil, through the 1950s and '60s. The label started selling records from the back of Chess' Cadillac, and launched the careers of legendary musical personalities such as blues singers and harmonica and guitar players Little Walter and Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, soul legend Etta James and guitarist singer-songwriters Chuck Berry and Willie Dixon.\n\nThe screenplay was written by director Darnell Martin. The filming of \"Cadillac Records\" started in February 2008. Filming locations included Louisiana, Mississippi, and New Jersey. Martin directed the film, financed by Sony BMG Film. \"Cadillac Records\" was produced by Andrew Lack and Sofia Sondervan, and co-executive produced by Beyoncé Knowles.\n\nOriginally, Matt Dillon was slated to play the role of Chess, but the role was ultimately given to Academy Award-winner Adrien Brody due to scheduling conflicts with Dillon. Early announcements of the cast also included Columbus Short as Little Walter, Golden Globe winner Jeffrey Wright as Muddy Waters, and multi-Grammy Award winner Beyoncé as Etta James. According to director Martin, the role of James was written with Beyoncé in mind.\n\nAs production increased, the roster grew to include Canadian actress Emmanuelle Chriqui as Revetta Chess, Tammy Blanchard as Isabelle Allen, English actor Eamonn Walker as Howlin' Wolf, and comedian Cedric the Entertainer as Willie Dixon. Final line ups of the cast also grew to include rapper Mos Def as Chuck Berry, and Gabrielle Union in the role of Geneva Wade, Muddy Waters' common law wife.\n\nThe American multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and record producer Steve Jordan produced the soundtrack to the film. He also picked a group of blues musicians, including Billy Flynn (guitar), Larry Taylor (bass), Eddie Taylor Jr. (guitar), Barrelhouse Chuck (piano), Kim Wilson (harmonica), Danny Kortchmar (guitar), Hubert Sumlin (guitar), and Bill Sims (guitar) who, along with Jordan on drums, recorded all of the blues songs used in the film.\n\nBeyoncé recorded five songs for the soundtrack, including a cover version of Etta James' \"At Last\" which was released on December 2, 2008 as its lead single. Mos Def, Jeffrey Wright, Columbus Short, and Eamonn Walker recorded songs for the soundtrack, and Raphael Saadiq, Beyoncé's sister Solange, Mary Mary, Nas, Buddy Guy, and Elvis Presley also appear on the album. The soundtrack was released in single and double-disc editions.\n\nThe month after the film was released, Beyoncé performed \"At Last\" at the inauguration ball of Barack Obama, as he and wife Michelle danced together for the first time as President and First Lady.\n\nThe soundtrack spent 48 weeks at number one of the Top Blues Albums.\n\nThe soundtrack was nominated for three 2010 Grammy Awards in the following categories: Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, Beyoncé's \"Once in a Lifetime\" for Best Song Written for Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media and Beyoncé's \"At Last\" for Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance.\n\nThe film had its world premiere on November 24, 2008 at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. On December 5, 2008, it entered general release in the United States. On its opening weekend, the film opened at Number 9, grossing $3.4 million in 686 cinemas with an $5,023 average. When the film left cinemas in January 2009, it had yet to recoup its $12 million budget; it ended its run with a worldwide box office gross of $8,880,045.\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives a score of 68% based on reviews from 120 critics. Its consensus state that \"What \"Cadillac Records\" may lack in originality, it more than makes up for in strong performances and soul-stirring music.\" Another review aggretator, Metacritic, gave the film a 65% approval rating based on 30 reviews classifying that the film has \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun Times\" gave the film three stars and stated in his review that \"The film is a fascinating record of the evolution of a black musical style, and the tangled motives of the white men who had an instinct for it.\" Elizabeth Weitzman of the \"Daily News\" awarded the film three stars and wrote in her review, \"Writer-director Darnell Martin clearly respects the fact that the history of Chess Records is a worthy subject.\" Most critics praised the film for its music, but complained about its script. Jim Harrington of the \"San Jose Mercury News\" praised Beyoncé's vocal performance and wrote in his review that, \"Beyoncé Knowles' captivating voice and the film's other pluses can't outweigh the glaring omissions from the story line for this critic\" and \"Chess Records deserves, and will hopefully someday get, a better spin than the one delivered by \"Cadillac Records\".\"\n\nDavid Edelstein of \"New York\" magazine named it the 4th best film of 2008,\nStephanie Zacharek of \"Salon\" named it the 4th best film of 2008, and\nA. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" named it the 10th best film of 2008. During the 2009 award season, Knowles received a Satellite Award nomination for her portrayal of Etta James. Knowles, Amanda Ghost, Scott McFarmon, Ian Dench, James Dring and Jody Street received a Golden Globe nomination, Best Original Song, for writing \"Once in a Lifetime\"; a song Knowles recorded for the film's soundtrack. The film also garnered seven NAACP Image Award nominations, which included Outstanding Motion Picture, Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture (Jeffrey Wright), Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture (Cedric the Entertainer, Columbus Short and Mos Def), and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture (Beyoncé Knowles).\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 10, 2009, and sold over 130,000 copies in its first week. To date it has made an estimate of $11,916,737 in sales, which coupled with its box office gross helped the film pay back its $12 million budget (total gross: $20,796,782).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20304102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20304102", "title": "Chalk Cliffs on Rügen", "text": "Chalk Cliffs on Rügen\n\nChalk Cliffs on Rügen () is an oil painting of circa 1818 by German Romantic artist Caspar David Friedrich.\n\nIn January 1818, Caspar David Friedrich married Christiane Caroline Bommer, who was about 20 years his junior. On their honeymoon in July and August 1818, they visited relatives in Neubrandenburg and Greifswald. From there, the couple undertook an excursion to the island of Rügen with Friedrich's brother Christian. The painting appears as a celebration of the couple's union.\n\nThe painting depicts the view from the chalk cliffs of the Stubbenkammer, at that time one of the most famous lookout points on the island. It is frequently but incorrectly believed that the \"Wissower Klinken\" outcrops in particular were a model for the painting; however, these did not exist at the time of the painting's creation, but appeared later because of erosion. Friedrich often composed his landscapes from carefully chosen elements of different sketches, so that a specific location is not necessarily discernible.\n\nTwo trees, whose leaves cover the upper third of the painting, frame the scenery. Two men and a woman in town clothes gaze in wonder at the view. The thin figure in the middle is usually interpreted as Caspar David Friedrich himself. His hat lies beside him as a sign of humility. He seeks for a foothold in the grass as a symbol of the transience of life and looks into the abyss opening before him—the abyss of death. On the right, the man with crossed arms leans against the trunk of a dying tree and looks far out to the sea. The two tiny sailboats stand as symbols for the soul which opens to eternal life and correspond to the figures of the two men. On the left, the woman in a red dress (who is usually identified as Friedrich's wife Caroline) sits beside an almost dried-up shrub: only the twigs around her face are leafing out. With her right hand she points either at the abyss or at the flowers bordering it. In contrast to the men, who gaze either at the abyss or into the distance, she communicates with the other figures—whether she feels threatened by the abyss or compelled by the natural beauty is unclear.\n\nThe colors of the figure's clothes are also symbolic. The middle figure is blue, the color of faith; the left figure is red, that of love; and the right figure is green, that of hope. Thus they can be interpreted as embodiments of the three Christian theological virtues: faith, hope and love. The art historian Helmut Börsch-Supan sees in the picture a representation of Friedrich's relation to death, and the threat to life by death: \"clear [...] as almost never before, but at the same time also in an unusually serene mood\".\n\n"}

His older brother, Domenico, was also a well-known artist and they often worked together.\n\nHe was born in Milan, where his father was a chef and butler at the Milanese court. He took his first formal art lessons at the Brera Academy, where he studied with Luigi Sabatelli from 1839 to 1846. His first exhibit was in 1845; composed of portraits and a scene from \"The Betrothed\" by Alessandro Manzoni (now lost).\n\nIn 1848, he and Domenico were participants in the Five Days of Milan and had to flee to avoid reprisals by the Austrian government. They spent two years in Ticino, then returned and settled in Florence. His brother went back to painting, but he enlisted in a volunteer regiment led by General Giacomo Medici and fought against the French during their siege of Rome. He also managed to produce numerous sketches of the war.\n\nWhile engaged in the defense of the , near Porta San Pancrazio, he was stabbed with several bayonets and seriously wounded while leading a charge. After a long recovery, he was able to return to Milan under the protection of Count Giulio Litta, a composer and avid art collector. Because of his injuries, he was exempt from being inducted into the Austrian army and went to work in his brother's studio. In the following years, he created many works based on the events of the Risorgimento, as well as genre works, influenced by his brother.\n\nFrom 1854 to 1855, during the Crimean War, he was back in uniform; this time with the Bersaglieri of Alessandro La Marmora. Once again, he made numerous sketches that were turned into paintings and lithographs. These included a depiction of the Battle of the Chernaya that was purchased by King Victor Emmanuel II. Some of his works were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. In 1859, despite lingering health issues, he enlisted in the Hunters of the Alps and came to be recognized by Garibaldi as the official painter of the Risorgimento, especially on matters of an official character. His genre scenes became almost entirely devoted to military themes.\n\nDuring the 1860s, in addition to his patriotic canvases, he created some large decorative works; including an allegory on Rome and Florence for the new Milano Centrale railway station (now demolished), and a curtain depicting the \" of Naples\" for the theater in Gallarate. In 1861, he received a gold medal at an exhibition in Florence for his painting of the Battle of Magenta, but gave it up in solidarity with the painters who had been overlooked.\n\nAfter unification had been achieved, his genre works tended to focus on scenes from the seventeenth century and he began to exhibit paintings on a wider variety of topics outside Italy, including Vienna (1873), Paris (1878), Antwerp (1885) and London (1888). His best-known work from this period is \"A Game of Chess\", a scene from a play of the same name by Giuseppe Giacosa. He died in Milan in 1890, after a long illness.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33846769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33846769", "title": "House of the Centenary", "text": "House of the Centenary\n\nThe House of the Centenary (Italian Casa del Centenario, also known as the House of the Centenarian) was the house of a wealthy resident of Pompeii, preserved by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The house was discovered in 1879, and was given its modern name to mark the 18th centenary of the disaster. Built in the mid-2nd century BC, it is among the largest houses in the city, with private baths, a nymphaeum, a fish pond \"(piscina)\", and two atria. The Centenary underwent a remodeling around 15 AD, at which time the bath complex and swimming pool were added. In the last years before the eruption, several rooms had been extensively redecorated with a number of paintings.\n\nAlthough the identity of the house's owner eludes certainty, arguments have been made for either Aulus Rustius Verus or Tiberius Claudius Verus, both local politicians.\n\nAmong the varied paintings preserved in the House of the Centenary is the earliest known depiction of Vesuvius, as well as explicit erotic scenes in a room that may have been designed as a private \"sex club\".\n\nFor the purposes of archaeological and historical study, Pompeii is divided into nine regions, each of which contains numbered blocks \"(insulae)\". Within a block, doorways are numbered in clockwise or counter-clockwise order; the Centenary is numbered IX.8.3–6. It belongs to the luxurious \"tufa\" period of Pompeiian architecture, characterized by the use of fine-grained gray volcanic tufa that was quarried around Nuceria. \n\nOf the two atria, the grander one leads to the most highly decorated rooms. The smaller atrium might have been for private family and service access. The triclinium or dining room was situated so that the guest of honor could view the enclosed garden. The dining room itself was decorated with vertical stalks entwined with tendrils on which birds perch, with leaf-adorned candelabra in the panels between. The house had its own bakery, located in a cellar under the service quarters on the west side.\nA graffito in the latrine uses the rare word \"cacaturit\" (\"wants to shit\") found also once in the \"Epigrams\" of Martial. Another records a slave's bid for freedom: \"Officiosus escaped on November 6 of the consulate of Drusus Caesar and M. Junius Silanus\" (15 AD).\n\nIt has been suggested that one secluded room (numbered 43), which was decorated with explicit scenes of female-male intercourse, functioned as a private \"sex club.\" Guests would have entered the smaller, more private atrium, then passed down a corridor and through a triclinium and antechamber to reach it. A few similar rooms in Pompeiian houses suggest that the intention was to create the ambience of a brothel in a home, for parties at which participants played the roles of prostitute or client, or for which actual prostitutes were hired to entertain guests. A small opening oddly positioned in the wall may have been an aperture for voyeurism. Other scholars categorize Room 43 simply as a bedroom \"(cubiculum)\", which often featured erotic imagery, and find it unnecessary to conclude that sexual entertainment was offered to guests there.\n\nThe House of the Centenary is known for its large and diverse collection of paintings in the Third and Fourth Pompeiian styles. The garden nymphaeum is a particularly rich example of combining painting with architectural elements to create the ambience of a country villa. A body of water filled with a variety of fish and marine animals was \"dramatically\" painted on the parapet that encircled the four walls of the nymphaeum; several species are represented accurately enough to identify. The lower part of the wall is painted to look like a balustrade with ivy growing on it, with birds and lizards below. Fountains with sphinx bases are painted within garden scenes to the sides, and the wall around the entrance depicts game parks; in the foreground is a real fountain, with a faux finish to look like rare marble, from which the water would have run down tiers into a basin. Below the steps and above the garden pool, there was a painting of a river god crowned with reeds, no longer visible. The composition has been characterized as a \"grotesque potpourri\", an assemblage of elements desirable because they represent the country villa lifestyle. Here and in similarly decorated spaces in Pompeii, the owner is concerned with displaying size and quantity and not a harmonious whole.\n\nThe room to the north of the peristyle featured delicate ivy and stylized flowering vines as decoration. Ducks and lotus leaves also appear together as decorative motifs. Grapes and viticulture appear throughout the house, as in a scene of cupids gathering grapes. The hunting paintings are by the Pompeiian painter Lucius. \n\nMythological subjects include Theseus as victor over the Minotaur, Hermaphroditus and Silenus, Hercules and Telephus, and of Orestes and Pylades before Thoas. Another room features Selene and Endymion, a \"Venus Piscatrix\" (\"Venus the Fisherwoman\"), and \"floating nymphs.\"\nA painting in the house's \"lararium\", a shrine to the household gods the Lares, depicts Vesuvius as it may have looked before the eruption, with a single vineyard-covered peak instead of the double-peak profile of today. Although some scholars reject the single-peak hypothesis, the painting is generally regarded as the earliest known representation of the volcano, even if it should not be taken as a record of what Vesuvius actually looked like.\n\nLiterary sources also describe Vesuvius as covered in grape vines before the eruption. Plutarch says that vines had grown on it in the 1st century BC, when Spartacus and his fellow slaves had taken refuge there and cut them down to make rope ladders. The description by the poet Martial evokes the painting, which shows vines on the slopes in quincunx arrangement:\n\n\"Here Vesuvius is shaded green with vines; here the noble grape had exuded its juices in vats: these are the ridges which Bacchus loved more than the hills of Nysa.\"\n\nThe unusual depiction of Bacchus gives him a body composed of grapes, which may represent either the Aminaea variety grown in the area or the eponymous Pompeianum. He carries a thyrsus and has a panther at his feet. In the foreground is a crested and bearded serpent that embodies the Agathodaemon or Genius.\n\nSome of the mythological paintings, including one of Medea, are thought to represent scenes from the theatre. The painting of Hercules may be a scene from the \"Hercules Furens\" of either Seneca or Euripides; the other figures would thus be Amphitryon, Megara, and Lycus. A scene from \"Iphigenia in Tauris\" shows Pylades, Orestes, and Iphigenia.\n\nAnother theatrical reference is found in a graffito scrawled on the wall between the \"tepidarium\" (a bath maintained at a pleasantly warm temperature) and the \"caldarium\" (an environment more like a steam bath). Reading \"histrionica Actica\", \"Actica the pantomime,\" the phrase has been interpreted as a record of fan infatuation, and perhaps an indication that the house hosted performances by theatre troupes.\n\nPompeiian bedrooms were not infrequently decorated with scenes referring to lovemaking, sometimes explicitly human, and sometimes allusive and mythological.\nOne bedroom at the Centenary features a pair of scenes referring to love affairs between a mortal and a divinity: Selene and Endymion, and Cassandra with a laurel branch symbolizing her rejection of Apollo as a lover and his revenge. The \"sex club\" has both: it is decorated with a painting of Hercules surrounded by \"amorini\", as well two \"pornographic\" scenes \"(symplegma)\" similar to those found in brothels. Roman \"pornography\" (literally \"depiction of prostitutes\") focuses on human figures in everyday settings, often with detailed and realistic bedding.\n\nBoth pornographic images in Room 43 show a woman on top of a man, one facing him, and the other in the less common \"reverse upright Venus\" position, facing away from the man. In the former image, both figures are nude, except that the woman's breasts are covered with a strapless \"bra\" \"(strophium)\"; even in the most explicit depictions of sex acts in Roman art, the woman is often wearing the \"strophium\". The rarer \"reverse upright Venus\" position is more often found in scenes set in Nilotic Egypt.\n\n"}

The site is moorland forming part of the Bewick and Beanley Moors SSSI, although prior to the Bronze Age it is likely to have been thickly forested with broadleaf deciduous trees. This site is most famous for the cup and ring mark art present on the outcrop.\n\nHunterheugh derives from Old English \"huntor\" \"hunter\" and \"hoh\" \"hill-spur\".\n\nThe first phase of the carvings is all on the natural rock surface and these are now very heavily weathered. The motifs incorporate undulations of the surface into their design so that most are connected to each other by artificial grooves or by a natural rock slope which allows water to flow from one design to the next. This phase is believed to be Neolithic, and probably early Neolithic at that. This is supported by the discovery of what appears to be a broken sandstone axehead 1.2 m from the carved rock outcrop at the base of the topsoil. Such ground and polished axeheads are known from elsewhere in Northumberland.\n\nPhase 1 of the carvings was broken through when the rock dome was quarried at a later date. New carvings were then made on the surfaces exposed by quarrying. These show no attempt to take undulations and variations in the rock (with one exception), none of the designs are inter-connected, and the shapes are more varied and more crudely executed. This phase is believed to be Early Bronze Age in date and appears to imitate the earlier tradition, but does not share the same sense of positioning.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "105883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=105883", "title": "Julie Brown", "text": "Julie Brown\n\nJulie Ann Brown (born August 31, 1958) is an American actress, comedian, screen/television writer, singer-songwriter, and television director. Brown is perhaps best known for her work in the 1980s, where she often played a quintessential valley girl character. Much of her comedy has revolved around the mocking of famous people (with a strong and frequently revisited focus on Madonna).\n\nJulie Brown began her career performing in nightclubs. She began working on television with a guest spot on the sitcom \"Happy Days\". She also appeared in the 1981 cult film \"Bloody Birthday\". After a small role in the Clint Eastwood comedy film \"Any Which Way You Can\", comedian Lily Tomlin saw Brown at a comedy club and gave her her first big break, a part in her 1981 film \"The Incredible Shrinking Woman\". Tomlin and Brown eventually became close friends. A string of guest starring appearances in a variety of television shows followed, including: \"Laverne & Shirley\", \"Buffalo Bill\", \"The Jeffersons\" and \"Newhart\". Brown also appeared in short films such as \"Five Minutes, Miss Brown\".\n\nIn 1984, she released her first EP, a five-song album called \"Goddess in Progress\". The album, parodies of popular '80s music combined with her valley girl personality, was quickly discovered by the Dr. Demento Show. The songs \"'Cause I'm a Blonde\" and \"The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun\" were given radio airplay across the world. The latter was a spoof on stereotypical 1950s' teen tragedy songs, with cheerleaders' heads and pompoms being blown to pieces.\n\nIn 1987, Brown released her first full-length album, \"Trapped in the Body of a White Girl\". The album highlighted her comedic talent and valley girl personality. The album's highlights were \"I Like 'em Big and Stupid\" and the reprised \"The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun\". (The album was reissued on CD in 2010 by Collector's Choice Music on its Noble Rot label.) Music videos were recorded and received heavy airplay on MTV. In 1989, Brown starred in that cable network's comedy and music-video show \"Just Say Julie\". She played the role of a demanding, controlling, and pessimistic glamour-puss from the valley, making fun of popular music acts while at the same time introducing their music videos. (She was also known as \"Miss Julie Brown\" at the time to differentiate her from Downtown Julie Brown, who was on the network at the same time.)\n\nBrown's film career began in 1988 with the release of the film \"Earth Girls Are Easy\", written, produced by, and starring Brown, it was based loosely on a song by the same name from her debut EP. The film also starred Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. Brown cast then-unknown comedians Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans. In 1990 Brown had a brief part in the movie \"The Spirit of '76\", as an intellectual stripper.\nNBC commissioned a half-hour pilot, ultimately unsold and airing Sunday, July 28, 1991, at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, titled \"The Julie Show\". Created by Brown, Charlie Coffey, and director and executive producer David Mirkin, it was a comedy about actress Julie Robbins (Brown), who in this initial story, goes to great lengths to land an interview with teen singer Kiki (played by Kim Walker) in the hopes of getting hired as a tabloid-TV celebrity journalist. Developed under the working title \"The Julie Brown Show\", it also starred Marian Mercer as Julie's mother, June; DeLane Matthews as Debra Deacon, a reporter on the fictional series \"Inside Scoop\"; Susan Messing as Julie's roommate Cheryl; and Kevin O'Rourke as \"Inside Scoop\" producer Tony Barnow. Brown was also a producer, with John Ziffren, and performed and co-wrote the theme song. Walker, Don Sparks, Robin Angers, and Deborah Driggs were guest performers in this production from Mirkinvision and New World Television.\n\nAnother pilot was filmed for CBS, \"Julie Brown: The Show\", and featured a similar theme, in which Brown was the hostess of a talk show and she would interview actual celebrity guests, interspersed with scripted scenarios. The pilot was aired but the show was not picked up; years later it leaked onto the Internet.\n\nIn 1992, Brown starred in her own Fox sketch comedy show, \"The Edge\"; two of its regulars, Jennifer Aniston and Wayne Knight, later became sitcom stars, while Tom Kenny went on to voice \"SpongeBob SquarePants\". That same year, she released the Showtime television movie \"\", a satire about Madonna and her backstage documentary, \"\". (Brown's co-star was Kathy Griffin.)\n\nBrown followed with another satire, \"Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 Women\", which lampooned the violence of ice skater Tonya Harding toward rival Nancy Kerrigan, as well as that of widely publicized castrator Lorena Bobbitt.\n\nShe has continued to make television guest appearances and contributed voices to various cartoons, including \"Animaniacs\" (as the voice of Minerva Mink),\" \" \"Aladdin\" as bratty mermaid Saleen, and as the original voice of Zatanna in the \"\" cartoon. Prior to this she also guest starred on a \"Tiny Toon Adventures\" episode as Julie Bruin, a cartoon bear version of herself, in which she guest starred in her own segment \"Just Say Julie Bruin\", a reference to her music video show. The \"Just Say Julie Bruin\" cartoon also was a music video show and in her segment Elmer Fudd guest starred as Fuddonna, parody of Madonna and a reference to Julie Brown herself regularly mocking her.\n\nBrown appeared as Coach Millie Stoeger in the film \"Clueless\", reprising that role on ABC's 1996-1999 spin-off TV series, for which she was also a writer, producer and director. Two regulars from the series, Donald Faison and Elisa Donovan, later found similarly successful roles, as would featured player Christina Milian who had a recurring role on the series during its UPN years. In 1998, Brown appeared in the parody movie \"Plump Fiction\". In 2000, she created the series \"Strip Mall\" for the Comedy Central network; it ran two seasons.\n\nSince 2004, Brown has been a commentator on E! network specials, including \"101 Reasons the '90s Ruled\", \"101 Most Starlicious Makeovers\", \"101 Most Awesome Moments in Entertainment\", and \"50 Most Outrageous TV Moments\".\n\nIn 2005, Brown purchased the rights to her \"Trapped\" album back from the record label and reissued it herself. She also self-released a single, \"I Want to Be Gay\". In late 2007, she also purchased the rights to her 1984 E.P. \"Goddess in Progress\" and re-released it as a full-length record with compiled unreleased tracks recorded during that era. Brown began touring in late 2007 with her one-woman show, \"Smell the Glamour\".\n\nIn 2008, she co-wrote and appeared as Dee La Duke in the Disney Channel original movie \"Camp Rock\", which starred Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers. Brown also joined the cast of the Canadian television series, \"Paradise Falls\", that same year.\n\nIn late 2008 Brown began releasing one-track digital singles, starting with \"The Ex-Beauty Queen's Got a Gun\"; it was a rewrite of \"Homecoming Queen\" with lyrics about Sarah Palin. This was first aired in September, 2008 on \"The Stephanie Miller Show.\" In 2011 she released an album \"Smell The Glamour\", which features satires of Lady Gaga, Kesha and updated versions of her \"Medusa\" songs.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 television season, Brown began a recurring role as Paula Norwood, a neighbor and friend of the Heck family, on the ABC comedy \"The Middle\". From 2010 to 2015 she was a writer for \"Melissa & Joey\", and played a gym teacher in one episode of the show. Also, in 2012 she appeared with Downtown Julie Brown as a guest judge on \"RuPaul's Drag Race\".\n\nBrown was born in Van Nuys, California, the daughter of Irish-Catholic parents Celia Jane (née McCann) and Leonard Francis Brown. Her father worked at NBC TV studios in the advertising accounting \"Traffic\" department, and her mother was a secretary at the same studio complex. Both of Brown's grandfathers had worked in the Hollywood film business. She attended a Catholic elementary school as a child, and later Van Nuys High School where she was chosen princess of the homecoming court. Brown's parents said \"whatever you do, don't become an actress\", but after attending Los Angeles Valley College she enrolled in the well-known San Francisco acting school, American Conservatory Theater, where she met future collaborator Charlie Coffey.\n\nIn 1983, Brown married writer and actor Terrence E. McNally, another frequent collaborator. They co-produced her first single, \"I Like 'em Big and Stupid\". They divorced after six years. In 1994, Brown married Ken Rathgen, and together they have one son. She said in 2007 that she had recently divorced for the second time.\n\n\n\n"}

A WATERFALL NEAR AN OAK WOOD. Sm. Suppl. 1. In the left foreground is a waterfall divided in the middle by a rock ; to the left is a tree-trunk lying half in the stream. In the right foreground is a rocky bank with a birch stem bent to the right. In the \nright middle distance is a great oak wood, traversed by a road on which stand a man and boy conversing with a woman who sits nursing a child. \nTo the left of the road is the stream, through which two persons apparently men drive a flock of sheep. Beyond is a wooded slope. In the centre is a view over a cornfield with sheaves ; in the distance is a village with two wind-mills and a church. A fine evening, with rolling clouds and sunlight falling on the cornfield and wood. \"This excellent \npicture, in addition to its being one of the largest works of the artist, is singularly grand and rich in its composition, combined with unusual clearness and brilliancy of colouring and the most masterly execution, justly entitling it to the appellation of a chef d'oeuvre\" (Sm.).\n\nSigned in full on a stone on the right at foot ; canvas though the Amsterdam catalogue says it is on oak panel 56 inches by 76 1/2 inches. Exhibited at Amsterdam, 1845, No. 134. \nBought by an ancestor of Sir Charles Blount, Bart., on the Continent about the year 1740 (Sm.). In the collection of Sir Charles Blount, Bart., who sold it to Sm. in 1836. Sold by Sm. to A. van der Hoop, Amsterdam, 1837 (for 1450). Bequeathed by A. van der Hoop to Amsterdam with his collection in 1854. In the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, Van der Hoop bequest, 1910 catalogue, No. 2075.\"\n\nThis scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael made of waterfalls. As a warning of the forces of nature, these often included logs or broken tree stumps as silent witness to a more flooded scene than the one depicted. These must have sold well, as most of what remains today of Ruisdael's oeuvre are waterfall scenes. Inspired by the dramatic works of Allaert van Everdingen, Ruisdael also made more Nordic versions (such as \"A Waterfall in a Rocky Landscape\"), which included pine trees and mountains.\n"}

Magnús began his work at Auðkúla in 1607 after he had been dismissed from his office as parish minister, and completed his new redaction during the winter of 1608-09. Magnús would later serve as the priest at Laufás parish in Northern Iceland and as a consequence his version of the Edda was falsely referred to as the Laufás Edda.\n\nThe purpose of his efforts was to make a systematic and encyclopedic version of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda. Laufás Edda is a rearranged redaction of the Snorra Edda. The myths in \"Gylfaginning\" are presented as a series of examples (apologi or dæmisögur) and the kennings of \"Skáldskaparmál\" are organized alphabetically. The last part, \"Háttatal\", was not included.\n\nDue to its popularity, the Laufás redaction later became the basis for the first printed Edition of the Snorra Edda, Peder Hansen Resen's Edda Islandorum. Resen's edition was accompanied by a Danish and Latin translation. The Laufás Edda, especially through Resen's edition, became a convenient and popular work of reference for poets and antiquarians, serving as an encyclopedia for researching both myth and poetic language.\n\n\n\n"}

A 10-year restoration process was completed in 2008, after which the painting was returned to its home at the Uffizi in Florence. During the restoration, an antique copy replaced the painting in the gallery.\n\nRaphael is considered to be a “master” of the High Renaissance, a title he shares with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. He was born in 1483 and died in 1520, living a mere thirty-seven years. Despite his relatively short lifespan, he was highly influential throughout his time on earth. He produced a vast quantity of work in a variety of media. He was active in architecture, printmaking, painting, and drawing. During the first half of his career, he spent years traveling across Northern Italy and was influenced by the Florentine styles he saw there, causing this stage to be called his Florentine Period. After which, in 1508, he moved to Rome where he continued to work. Many of his commissions came from the Vatican, including the Apostolic Palace, which brought about one of his most famous works, School of Athens. Due to his relationship with the church, he and Michelangelo were fierce rivals throughout both of their careers, and often competed for the same commissions. \nDuring his Florentine period, this work, The Madonna Del Cardellino, was painted along with several other well-known Madonnas: The Madonna of the Meadow and La Belle Jardinière. All three share several characteristics: Madonna is clothed in red and blue, the same three subjects are painted, the pyramidal composition, the natural background, and the connection to the church through the representation of books, crosses, or, indeed, the goldfinch.\n\nIn this painting, as in most of the Madonnas of his Florentine period, Raphael arranged the three figures - Mary, Christ and the young John the Baptist - to fit into a geometrical design. Though the positions of the three bodies are natural, together they form an almost regular triangle. The Madonna is shown young and beautiful, as with Raphael’s various other Madonnas. She is also clothed in red and blue, also typical, for red signifies the passion of Christ and blue was used to signify the church. Christ and John are still very young, only babies. John holds a goldfinch in his hand, and Christ is reaching out to touch it. The background is one typical of Raphael. The natural setting is diverse and yet all calmly frames the central subject taking place.\n\nThe Madonna was a wedding gift from Raphael to his friend Lorenzo Nasi. On November 17, 1548 Nasi's house was destroyed by an earthquake and the painting broke into seventeen pieces. It was immediately taken to be salvaged, and was hastily put back together, though the seams were quite visible. In 2002, George Bonsanti of the Precious Stones organization gave the task of restoration to Patrizia Riitano. During the six-year process that followed, her team worked to remove the years of grime that had degraded the painting's color, and to fix the damage done by the earthquake long ago. Before beginning the project, they studied the work as closely as possible, utilizing resources such as X-rays, CAT scans, reflective infra-red photography, and even lasers. Riitano closely studied the past quick fix layers that had been applied and removed them until the original by Raphael finally shone through. The restoration was completed in 2008, and the painting was put on display in Uffizi.\n\nIn \"Madonna Del Cardellino\", the goldfinch represents Christ’s crucifixion. The reason for its association comes from the legend that its red spot was born at the time of the crucifixion. It flew down over the head of Christ and was taking a thorn from His crown, when it was splashed with the drop of His blood. The book in Mary’s hand reads \"Sedes Sapientiae\" or \"The Throne of Wisdom\". This term usually is applied to images in which Mary is seated upon a throne, with Jesus on her lap, but in this case, the inscription implies the rock on which Mary sits is her natural throne.\n\nIn some versions of Vasari another similar painting is described as the Vallombrosa version but it has never been identified.\n\n"}

In 1995, he co-founded the CAN (Art Center of Neuchâtel) and was its director until 2000, when he became the director of the Swiss Institute in New York (2000-2006).\n\nDuring the last twenty years, Wahler has organized over 400 exhibitions.\n\nIn 2011, he was decorated as a Chevalier in the French Republic's Order of Arts and Letters. \nIn 2013, Wahler was awarded the Meret Oppenheim Prize, Switzerland highest cultural award in the contemporary arts.\n\nWahler co-founded CAN Centre d’art Neuchâtel, Switzerland in 1995, and ran it until 2000. Under his artistic directorship, CAN organized solo shows with Gianni Motti (1995), Olivier Mosset (1996), Jonathan Monk (1997), Steven Parrino (1998), and Roman Signer (1999). Group shows included artists such as Philippe Parreno (1995), Franz West (1995), Sadie Benning (1995), Fischli & Weiss (1996), Mike Kelley (1996), Paul McCarthy (1996), Ugo Rondinone (1996), Matthew Ritchie (1997), Pavel Pepperstein (1999), and Robert McCollum (1999).\n\nFrom 2000 to 2006, Wahler ran the Swiss Institute in New York and curated large projects with artists such as Christoph Büchel, Jim Shaw, Ugo Rondinone, Valentin Carron, Urs Fischer, Takashi Murakami, Martin Creed, and Aleksandra Mir.\n\nFrom 2006-2012, Wahler was the director of the Palais de Tokyo, one of the most frequently visited contemporary art centers in Europe. Wahler is known for creating a museum that breaks down barriers between high and low culture and different artistic mediums (such as architecture, fine arts, dance, literature, theatre, and music).\n\nAs director of Palais de Tokyo, he set the current pace of 30 to 40 exhibitions a year. The solo shows have included such artists as Tatiana Trouvé, Peter Coffin, Steven Parrino, Jonathan Monk, Roman Signer, Christoph Büchel, Paul Laffoley, Joe Coleman, Loris Gréaud, Charlotte Posenenske, Micol Assael, Ceal Floyer, Michel Blazy, Ulla von Brandenburg, Camille Henrot, and Oscar Tuazon.\n\nWahler's first show at Palais de Tokyo was \"Five Billion Years\" (2006), which served as a prologue for his six-year curatorial program. His later group shows dealt with the limits between what is visible and invisible: \"M, News From the Upside-Down\" (2007), \"La Marque Noire\" (2007), \"Superdome\" (2008), \"Gakona\" (2009), and \"Spy Numbers\" (2009). Next, \"Chasing Napoleon\" (2009-2010) examined the notion of disappearance.\n\nIn 2011, Wahler curated \"Dynasty\" with Fabrice Hergott, the director of the Museum of Modern Art, Paris. They exhibited a total of 80 works from 40 French artists under the age of 35 in both the Palais de Tokyo and the Museum of Modern Art, Paris. In addition to \"Dynasty\", Wahler created the \"Modules\", a series of art exhibits which focused on emergent artists. He also created the \"Carte Blanche\", a still ongoing series which give an artist the opportunity to present a special project covering the entirety of the exhibition space of Palais de Tokyo and offering a kind of map of the artist’s brain, desires and influences. \nA review noted that \"under Mr. Wahler, the Palais de Tokyo has become one of the city’s best springboards for young artists.\"\n\nWahler is also known for adding a rooftop hotel and a rooftop restaurant, to the already existent bookstore and restaurant Tokyo-eat. He installed the Lang and Baumann artist project Everland Hotel (a one-room hotel room available to the public) on the museum's roof. Wahler removed Everland after a year and replaced it with Laurent Grasso's artist project Nomiya, a one-room restaurant for 12 people.\n\nWahler is the founder and director of a new structure, The Chalet Society, designed to encourage reflection on contemporary art institutions and to investigate new possibilities for exhibitions by testing forms, spaces, discourses, and protocols. The mobile structure endeavors to develop formats that work on a variety of platforms, similar to open source software that can run on any hardware.\nThe Chalet Society reacts to the boldest artistic settings and acts itself as a community of artists, collectors, researchers, and other enthusiasts, searching for “poetic consciousness,” an idea attributed to Saul Wahl Katzenellenbogen - crowned King of Poland in 1587. He only reigned for one night but had enough time to pronounce a number of predictions and appeal for the dawn of “poetic consciousness.”\n\nLaunched in October 2012 in a pop-up site – a disused school in the heart of Paris – the Chalet Society presented a variety of extraordinary self-taught or unknown artists in collaboration with the Museum of Everything.\n\nAfter having tested the limits of the commonly accepted notion of artist, the Chalet Society created the “Tester’s Salon” in the summer of 2013, a project by the art critic Christophe Kihm and the artists Arnaud and Bertrand Dezoteux. Here more than 40 artists were invited to reflect on testing an extensive range of exhibition formats.\n\nIn fall 2013 after the self-taught ‘outsider’ artists, the exhibition \"The Hidden World\", designed by the artist Jim Shaw, focused on artists who – while producing for specific commissions – have often got lost behind their intentions. Shaw collected over the past 40 years diverse didactic material, creating “a breathtaking and expansive journey through the myths and beliefs of America.”\n\nAs an independent curator, Marc-Olivier Wahler has curated numerous group shows, notably the decennial Outdoor Sculpture Exhibition \"Transfer. Art in Urban Space\" (Biel, 2000), Liquid Sky (Frac Bourgogne, 2003), \"OK / OKAY\" (Grey Art Gallery, NYU, 2003), \"Medio Dia - Media Noce\" (Centro Cultural Recoleta, Buenos Aires and Macro, Rosario, 2007), \"Lost (in LA)\" (LAMAG, Los Angeles, 2012), and \"From Triple X to Birdsong\" (KayneGriffinCorcoran Gallery, Los Angeles, 2013).\n\nAs an art critic, Marc-Olivier Wahler regularly writes on contemporary art and its theoretical problematic in international magazines, academic books and exhibition catalogues.

It is a branch of music psychology with numerous areas of study, including the nature of emotional reactions to music, how characteristics of the listener may determine which emotions are felt, and which components of a musical composition or performance may elicit certain reactions. The field draws upon and has significant implications for such areas as philosophy, musicology, music therapy, music theory and aesthetics, as well the acts of musical composition and performance.\n\nTwo of the most influential philosophers in the aesthetics of music are Stephen Davies and Jerrold Levinson. Davies calls his view of the expressiveness of emotions in music \"appearance emotionalism\", which holds that music expresses emotion without feeling it. Objects can convey emotion because their structures can contain certain characteristics that resemble emotional expression. \"The resemblance that counts most for music's expressiveness ... is between music's temporally unfolding dynamic structure and configurations of human behaviour associated with the expression of emotion.\" The observer can note emotions from the listener's posture, gait, gestures, attitude, and comportment.\n\nAssociations between musical features and emotion differ among individuals. Appearance emotionalism claims many listeners' perceiving associations constitutes the expressiveness of music. Which musical features are more commonly associated with which emotions is part of music psychology. Davies claims that expressiveness is an objective property of music and not subjective in the sense of being projected into the music by the listener. Music's expressiveness is certainly response-dependent, i.e. it is realized in the listener's judgement. Skilled listeners very similarly attribute emotional expressiveness to a certain piece of music, thereby indicating according to Davies (2006) that the expressiveness of music is somewhat objective because if the music lacked expressiveness, then no expression could be projected into it as a reaction to the music.\n\nThe philosopher Jenefer Robinson assumes the existence of a mutual dependence between cognition and elicitation in her description of 'emotions as process, music as process' theory (or 'process' theory). Robinson argues that the process of emotional elicitation begins with an 'automatic, immediate response that initiates motor and autonomic activity and prepares us for possible action' causing a process of cognition that may enable listeners to 'name' the felt emotion. This series of events continually exchanges with new, incoming information. Robinson argues that emotions may transform into one another, causing blends, conflicts, and ambiguities that make impede describing with one word the emotional state that one experiences at any given moment; instead, inner feelings are better thought of as the products of multiple emotional 'streams'. Robinson argues that music is a series of simultaneous processes, and that it therefore is an ideal medium for mirroring such more 'cognitive' aspects of emotion as musical themes' 'desiring' resolution or leitmotif's mirrors memory processes. These simultaneous musical processes can reinforce or conflict with each other and thus also express the way one emotion 'morphs into another over time'.\n\nThe ability to perceive emotion in music is said to develop early in childhood, and improve significantly throughout development. The capacity to perceive emotion in music is also subject to cultural influences, and both similarities and differences in emotion perception have been observed in cross-cultural studies. Empirical research has looked at which emotions can be conveyed as well as what structural factors in music help contribute to the perceived emotional expression. There are two schools of thought on how we interpret emotion in music. The cognitivists' approach argues that music simply displays an emotion, but does not allow for the personal experience of emotion in the listener. Emotivists argue that music elicits real emotional responses in the listener.\n\nIt has been argued that the emotion experienced from a piece of music is a multiplicative function of structural features, performance features, listener features and contextual features of the piece, shown as:\n\nwhere:\n\nStructural features are divided into two parts, segmental features and suprasegmental features. Segmental features are the individual sounds or tones that make up the music; this includes acoustic structures such as duration, amplitude, and pitch. Suprasegmental features are the foundational structures of a piece, such as melody, tempo and rhythm. There are a number of specific musical features that are highly associated with particular emotions. Within the factors affecting emotional expression in music, tempo is typically regarded as the most important, but a number of other factors, such as mode, loudness, and melody, also influence the emotional valence of the piece.\n\nPerformance features refers to the manner in which a piece of music is executed by the performer(s). These are broken into two categories, performer skills and performer state. Performer skills are the compound ability and appearance of the performer; including physical appearance, reputation and technical skills. The performer state is the interpretation, motivation, and stage presence of the performer.\n\nListener features refers to the individual and social identity of the listener(s). This includes their personality, age, knowledge of music, and motivation to listen to the music.\n\nContextual features are aspects of the performance such as the location and the particular occasion for the performance (i.e., funeral, wedding, dance).\n\nThese different factors influence expressed emotion at different magnitudes, and their effects are compounded by one another. Thus, experienced emotion is felt to a stronger degree if more factors are present. The order the factors are listed within the model denotes how much weight in the equation they carry. For this reason, the bulk of research has been done in structural features and listener features.\n\nWhich emotion is perceived is dependent on the context of the piece of music. Past research has argued that opposing emotions like happiness and sadness fall on a bipolar scale, where both cannot be felt at the same time. More recent research has suggested that happiness and sadness are experienced separately, which implies that they can be felt concurrently. One study investigated the latter possibility by having participants listen to computer-manipulated musical excerpts that have mixed cues between tempo and mode. Examples of mix-cue music include a piece with major key and slow tempo, and a minor-chord piece with a fast tempo. Participants then rated the extent to which the piece conveyed happiness or sadness. The results indicated that mixed-cue music conveys both happiness and sadness; however, it remained unclear whether participants perceived happiness and sadness simultaneously or vacillated between these two emotions. A follow up study was done to examine these possibilities. While listening to mixed or consistent cue music, participants pressed one button when the music conveyed happiness, and another button when it conveyed sadness. The results revealed that subjects pressed both buttons simultaneously during songs with conflicting cues. These findings indicate that listeners can perceive both happiness and sadness concurrently. This has significant implications for how the structural features influence emotion, because when a mix of structural cues is used, a number of emotions may be conveyed.\n\nStudies indicate that the ability to understand emotional messages in music starts early, and improves throughout child development. Studies investigating music and emotion in children primarily play a musical excerpt for children and have them look at pictorial expressions of faces. These facial expressions display different emotions and children are asked to select the face that best matches the music's emotional tone. Studies have shown that children are able to assign specific emotions to pieces of music; however, there is debate regarding the age at which this ability begins.\n\nAn infant is often exposed to a mother's speech that is musical in nature. It is possible that the motherly singing allows the mother to relay emotional messages to the infant. Infants also tend to prefer positive speech to neutral speech as well as happy music to negative music. It has also been posited that listening to their mother's singing may play a role in identity formation. This hypothesis is supported by a study that interviewed adults and asked them to describe musical experiences from their childhood. Findings showed that music was good for developing knowledge of emotions during childhood.\n\nThese studies have shown that children at the age of 4 are able to begin to distinguish between emotions found in musical excerpts in ways that are similar to adults. The ability to distinguish these musical emotions seems to increase with age until adulthood. However, children at the age of 3 were unable to make the distinction between emotions expressed in music through matching a facial expression with the type of emotion found in the music. Some emotions, such as anger and fear, were also found to be harder to distinguish within music.\n\nIn studies with four-year-olds and five-year-olds, they are asked to label musical excerpts with the affective labels \"happy\", \"sad\", \"angry\", and \"afraid\". Results in one study showed that four-year-olds did not perform above chance with the labels \"sad\" and \"angry\", and the five-year-olds did not perform above chance with the label \"afraid\". A follow-up study found conflicting results, where five-year-olds performed much like adults. However, all ages confused categorizing \"angry\" and \"afraid\".\nPre-school and elementary-age children listened to twelve short melodies, each in either major or minor mode, and were instructed to choose between four pictures of faces: happy, contented, sad, and angry. All the children, even as young as three years old, performed above chance in assigning positive faces with major mode and negative faces with minor mode.\n\nDifferent people perceive events differently based upon their individual characteristics. Similarly, the emotions elicited by listening to different types of music seem to be affected by factors such as personality and previous musical training. People with the personality type of agreeableness have been found to have higher emotional responses to music in general. Stronger sad feelings have also been associated with people with personality types of agreeableness and neuroticism. While some studies have shown that musical training can be correlated with music that evoked mixed feelings as well as higher IQ and test of emotional comprehension scores, other studies refute the claim that musical training affects perception of emotion in music. It is also worth noting that previous exposure to music can affect later behavioral choices, schoolwork, and social interactions. Therefore, previous music exposure does seem to have an effect on the personality and emotions of a child later in their life, and would subsequently affect their ability to perceive as well as express emotions during exposure to music. Gender, however, has not been shown to lead to a difference in perception of emotions found in music. Further research into which factors affect an individual's perception of emotion in music and the ability of the individual to have music-induced emotions are needed.\n\nAlong with the research that music conveys an emotion to its listener(s), it has also been shown that music can produce emotion in the listener(s). This view often causes debate because the emotion is produced within the listener, and is consequently hard to measure. In spite of controversy, studies have shown observable responses to elicited emotions, which reinforces the Emotivists' view that music does elicit real emotional responses.\n\nThe structural features of music not only help convey an emotional message to the listener, but also may create emotion in the listener. These emotions can be completely new feelings or may be an extension of previous emotional events. Empirical research has shown how listeners can absorb the piece's expression as their own emotion, as well as invoke a unique response based on their personal experiences.\n\nIn research on eliciting emotion, participants report personally feeling a certain emotion in response to hearing a musical piece. Researchers have investigated whether the same structures that conveyed a particular emotion could elicit it as well. The researchers presented excerpts of fast tempo, major mode music and slow tempo, minor tone music to participants; these musical structures were chosen because they are known to convey happiness and sadness respectively. Participants rated their own emotions with elevated levels of happiness after listening to music with structures that convey happiness and elevated sadness after music with structures that convey sadness. This evidence suggests that the same structures that convey emotions in music can also elicit those same emotions in the listener.\n\nIn light of this finding, there has been particular controversy about music eliciting negative emotions. Cognitivists argue that choosing to listen to music that elicits negative emotions like sadness would be paradoxical, as listeners would not willingly strive to induce sadness. However, emotivists purport that music does elicit negative emotions, and listeners knowingly choose to listen in order to feel sadness in an impersonal way, similar to a viewer's desire to watch a tragic film. The reasons why people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad has been explored by means of interviewing people about their motivations for doing so. As a result of this research it has indeed been found that people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad to intensify feelings of sadness. Other reasons for listening to sad music when feeling sad were; in order to retrieve memories, to feel closer to other people, for cognitive reappraisal, to feel befriended by the music, to distract oneself, and for mood enhancement. \nResearchers have also found an effect between one's familiarity with a piece of music and the emotions it elicits. In one study, half of participants were played twelve random musical excerpts one time, and rated their emotions after each piece. The other half of the participants listened to twelve random excerpts five times, and started their ratings on the third repetition. Findings showed that participants who listened to the excerpts five times rated their emotions with higher intensity than the participants who listened to them only once. This suggests that familiarity with a piece of music increases the emotions experienced by the listener.\n\nMusic may not only elicit new emotions, but connect listeners with other emotional sources. Music serves as a powerful cue to recall emotional memories back into awareness. Because music is such a pervasive part of social life, present in weddings, funerals and religious ceremonies, it brings back emotional memories that are often already associated with it. Music is also processed by the lower, sensory levels of the brain, making it impervious to later memory distortions. Therefore creating a strong connection between emotion and music within memory makes it easier to recall one when prompted by the other. Music can also tap into empathy, inducing emotions that are assumed to be felt by the performer or composer. Listeners can become sad because they recognize that those emotions must have been felt by the composer, much as the viewer of a play can empathize for the actors.\n\nListeners may also respond to emotional music through action. Throughout history music was composed to inspire people into specific action - to march, dance, sing or fight. Consequently, heightening the emotions in all these events. In fact, many people report being unable to sit still when certain rhythms are played, in some cases even engaging in subliminal actions when physical manifestations should be suppressed. Examples of this can be seen in young children's spontaneous outbursts into motion upon hearing music, or exuberant expressions shown at concerts.\n\nJuslin & Västfjäll developed a model of seven ways in which music can elicit emotion, called the BRECVEM model.\n\n\"Brain Stem Reflex\": 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by music because one or more fundamental acoustical characteristics of the music are taken by the brain stem to signal a potentially important and urgent event. All other things being equal, sounds that are sudden, loud, dissonant, or feature fast temporal patterns induce arousal or feelings of unpleasantness in listeners...Such responses reflect the impact of auditory sensations – music as sound in the most basic sense.'\n\n\"Rhythmic Entrainment\": 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is evoked by a piece of music because a powerful, external rhythm in the music influences some internal bodily rhythm of the listener (e.g. heart rate), such that the latter rhythm adjusts toward and eventually 'locks in' to a common periodicity. The adjusted heart rate can then spread to other components of emotion such as feeling, through proprioceptive feedback. This may produce an increased level of arousal in the listener.'\n\n\"Evaluative Conditioning\": 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music simply because this stimulus has been paired repeatedly with other positive or negative stimuli. Thus, for instance, a particular piece of music may have occurred repeatedly together in time with a specific event that always made you happy (e.g., meeting your best friend). Over time, through repeated pairings, the music will eventually come to evoke happiness even in the absence of the friendly interaction.'\n\n\"Emotional Contagion\": 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music because the listener perceives the emotional expression of the music, and then \"mimics\" this expression internally, which by means of either peripheral feedback from muscles, or a more direct activation of the relevant emotional representations in the brain, leads to an induction of the same emotion.'\n\n\"Visual Imagery\": 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because he or she conjures up visual images (e.g., of a beautiful landscape) while listening to the music.'\n\n\"Episodic memory\": 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because the music evokes a memory of a particular event in the listener's life. This is sometimes referred to as the \"Darling, they are playing our tune\" phenomenon.'\n\n\"Musical expectancy\": 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because a specific feature of the music violates, delays, or confirms the listener's expectations about the continuation of the music.'\n\nWith regards to violations of expectation in music several interesting results have been found. It has for example been found that listening to unconventional music may sometimes cause a meaning threat and result in compensatory behaviour in order to restore meaning.\n\nIn 2013, Juslin created an additional aspect to the BRECVEM model called aesthetic judgement. This is the criteria which each individual has as a metric for music's aesthetic value. This can involve a number of varying personal preferences, such as the message conveyed, skill presented or novelty of style or idea.\n\nThere has been a bulk of evidence that listeners can identify specific emotions with certain types of music, but there has been less concrete evidence that music may elicit emotions. This is due to the fact that elicited emotion is subjective; and thus, it is difficult to find a valid criterion to study it. Elicited and conveyed emotion in music is usually understood from three types of evidence: self-report, physiological responses, and expressive behavior. Researchers use one or a combination of these methods to investigate emotional reactions to music.\n\nThe self-report method is a verbal report by the listener regarding what they are experiencing. This is the most widely used method for studying emotion and has shown that people identify emotions and personally experience emotions while listening to music. Research in the area has shown that listeners' emotional responses are highly consistent. In fact, a meta-analysis of 41 studies on music performance found that happiness, sadness, tenderness, threat, and anger were identified above chance by listeners. Another study compared untrained listeners to musically trained listeners. Both groups were required to categorize musical excerpts that conveyed similar emotions. The findings showed that the categorizations were not different between the trained and untrained; thus demonstrating that the untrained listeners are highly accurate in perceiving emotion. It is more difficult to find evidence for elicited emotion, as it depends solely on the subjective response of the listener. This leaves reporting vulnerable to self-report biases such as participants responding according to social prescriptions or responding as they think the experimenter wants them to. As a result, the validity of the self-report method is often questioned, and consequently researchers are reluctant to draw definitive conclusions solely from these reports.\n\nEmotions are known to create physiological, or bodily, changes in a person, which can be tested experimentally. Some evidence shows one of these changes is within the nervous system. Arousing music is related to increased heart rate and muscle tension; calming music is connected to decreased heart rate and muscle tension, and increased skin temperature. Other research identifies outward physical responses such as shivers or goose bumps to be caused by changes in harmony and tears or lump-in-the-throat provoked by changes in melody. Researchers test these responses through the use of instruments for physiological measurement, such as recording pulse rate.\n\nPeople are also known to show outward manifestations of their emotional states while listening to music. Studies using facial electromyography (EMG) have found that people react with subliminal facial expressions when listening to expressive music. In addition, music provides a stimulus for expressive behavior in many social contexts, such as concerts, dances, and ceremonies. Although these expressive behaviors can be measured experimentally, there have been very few controlled studies observing this behavior.\n\nWithin the comparison between elicited and conveyed emotions, researchers have examined the relationship between these two types of responses to music. In general, research agrees that feeling and perception ratings are highly correlated, but not identical. More specifically, studies are inconclusive as to whether one response has a stronger effect than the other, and in what ways these two responses relate.\n\nIn one study, participants heard a random selection of 24 excerpts, displaying six types of emotions, five times in a row. Half the participants described the emotions the music conveyed, and the other half responded with how the music made them feel. The results found that emotions conveyed by music were more intense than the emotions elicited by the same piece of music. Another study investigated under what specific conditions strong emotions were conveyed. Findings showed that ratings for conveyed emotions were higher in happy responses to music with consistent cues for happiness (i.e., fast tempo and major mode), for sad responses to music with consistent cues for sadness (i.e., slow tempo and minor mode,) and for sad responses in general. These studies suggest that people can recognize the emotion displayed in music more readily than feeling it personally.\n\nAnother study that had 32 participants listen to twelve musical pieces and found that the strength of perceived and elicited emotions were dependent on the structures of the piece of music. Perceived emotions were stronger than felt emotions when listeners rated for arousal and positive and negative activation. On the other hand, elicited emotions were stronger than perceived emotions when rating for pleasantness.\n\nIn another study analysis revealed that emotional responses were stronger than the listeners' perceptions of emotions. This study used a between-subjects design, where 20 listeners judged to what extent they perceived four emotions: happy, sad, peaceful, and scared. A separate 19 listeners rated to what extent they experienced each of these emotions. The findings showed that all music stimuli elicited specific emotions for the group of participants rating elicited emotion, while music stimuli only occasionally conveyed emotion to the participants in the group identifying which emotions the music conveyed. \nBased on these inconsistent findings, there is much research left to be done in order to determine how conveyed and elicited emotions are similar and different. There is disagreement about whether music induces 'true' emotions or if the emotions reported as felt in studies are instead just participants stating the emotions found in the music they are listening to.\n\nMusic therapy as a therapeutic tool has been shown to be an effective treatment for various ailments. Therapeutic techniques involve eliciting emotions by listening to music, composing music or lyrics and performing music.\nMusic therapy sessions may have the ability to help drug users who are attempting to break a drug habit, with users reporting feeling better able to feel emotions without the aid of drug use. Music therapy may also be a viable option for people experiencing extended stays in a hospital due to illness. In one study, music therapy provided child oncology patients with enhanced environmental support elements and elicited more engaging behaviors from the child. When treating troubled teenagers, a study by Keen revealed that music therapy has allowed therapists to interact with teenagers with less resistance, thus facilitating self-expression in the teenager.\nMusic therapy has also shown great promise in individuals with autism, serving as an emotional outlet for these patients. While other avenues of emotional expression and understanding may be difficult for people with autism, music may provide those with limited understanding of socio-emotional cues a way of accessing emotion.\n\n"}

NTD productions combine American Sign Language with spoken language to fulfill the theatre's mission statement of linking deaf and hearing communities and educating the public about Deaf art. The NTD is affiliated with a drama school, also founded in 1967, and with the Little Theatre of the Deaf (LTD), established in 1968 to produce shows for a younger audience. \n\nThe first official performance of the NTD was at Wesleyan University in 1967. NTD members participated in the first National and Worldwide Deaf Theatre Conference in 1994. Many deaf actors have earned acclaim through their work with the NTD in performances, conferences, and community outreach. The NTD has been fundamental in the creation of an international Deaf theatre community, and has received several awards, including the Tony Award for Theatrical Excellence. The company has visited each of the 50 states during over 150 national tours, as well as over 30 countries.\n\nIn 1946, Robert Panara, a Gallaudet University graduate and newly hired teacher at the New York School for the Deaf, produced a play with Bernard Bragg, a 17-year-old student in Panara's English class. Later in the 1940s, when Bragg was a student at Gallaudet, Panara left New York School for the Deaf to teach at Gallaudet. While both at Gallaudet, Panara and Bragg conceived of the idea of a theater for the deaf.\n\nIn 1963, Dr. Edna Levine, a professor of Deaf studies at New York University, saw Bragg perform a one-man show in New York City. She asked him for a meeting and shared her own vision for a national theater for the deaf. In 1965, they obtained a federal grant from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish the NTD. Additional grant money was given by the Office of Education. Mary E. Switzer of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare and Boyce R. Williams and Malcolm Norwood of the Rehabilitation Services Administration were important advocates of funding the NTD.\n\nLevine and Bragg worked with set designer David Hays to establish a mission statement, locate funding, select a location, and assemble a company. The founders also included Ann Bancroft, who played Annie Sullivan in the Broadway production of \"The Miracle Worker\", and Arthur Penn and Gene Lasko, directors of \"The Miracle Worker\".\n\nThe founders' mission was to feature sign language in the theater for both deaf and hearing audiences. The founders believed that audience members need to “hear every word and see every word” in all NTD productions. To fulfill this mission, productions included both deaf and hearing actors. The language used by the deaf performers included sign language, mime, and gesture, and the hearing actors provided spoken language. Bragg had studied under the French mime Marcel Marceau, and his acting style influenced the early NTD productions.\n\nOriginally, the NTD was located on the campus of the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center in Waterford, Connecticut. In 1983, the NTD moved to Chester, Connecticut. In 2000, the NTD moved to Hartford, Connecticut, and in 2004 moved onto the campus of the American School for the Deaf in West Hartford. Since 2012, the NTD has again been based at the O'Neill Theatre Center while maintaining a satellite office on the campus of the American School for the Deaf.\n\nThe founding company included:\n\n\nEarly instructors in the school included:\n\n\nThe school's curriculum included:\n\n\nPhyllis Frelich received the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play in 1980 for \"Children of a Lesser God\", produced by the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nLinda Bove appeared regularly on the television series \"Sesame Street\".\n\nOther actors who have worked with NTD include Colleen Dewhurst, Sir Michael Redgrave, Chita Rivera, Jason Robards, and Meryl Streep. While some NTD actors have achieved recognition in hearing theatre, a greater number of Deaf actors, including Chuck Baird, Eric Malzkuhn, Ed Waterstreet, Gilberst Eastman, Mary Beth Miller, and Manny Hernandez, have achieved recognition primarily within deaf theatre.\n\nThough not an NTD actor, Lauren Ridloff, the actress cast as Sarah in the 2018 revival of \"Children of a Lesser God\", was nominated in May 2018 for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.\n\nRehearsals and performances occupied most of each day for both company actors and students. The company toured by bus both domestically and internationally, received only part-time pay, and paid out-of-pocket for their travel. Both the company and the students lived dormitory-style at the O'Neill Theatre Center while rehearsing, and slept either on the bus or in inexpensive hotels while touring domestically. While touring internationally, the actors stayed in hostels.\n\nThe company performed both traditional plays and plays written by Deaf playwrights. Hearing audiences have typically had positive responses to NTD productions, while Deaf and Hard of Hearing audiences have often had mixed reviews. Deaf and Hard of Hearing audience members sometimes expected productions to be more focused around the Deaf experience, and to be less highly dramatized. Some Deaf audience members have seen NTD productions as catering to Hearing audiences, which has generated a negative response. However, many Deaf audience members have responded positively and appreciated NTD productions.\n\nThe NTD has been discussed in newspapers such as \"Silent News\", journals such as the \"Puppetry Journal\", and television shows such as \"Deaf Mosaic\", which aired during the 1980s and 1990s. Many scholars have written about the NTD in books and dissertations.\n\n"}

This is a drawing photograph project to rhetorically rescue popular icons with geometric structure drawings or make photo image of the people tactically static. His pigeonhole or kind of compartmental examples of doodling were engaged on found images in various printed media and also were found in his sketchbook, books, notebooks and often in his borrowed books. The word 'Ninki' (人気) is a Japanese word which means be Popular or popularity. The Ninki: UoPDP art Project of drawing on photographs consist of numerous archetypal images of popular celebrities in vague appearance. Their career, character, fame, obscurity, activities and character are insurgent and idiosyncratic. Artist Firoz has started on any image and then specifically on Bengal tiger and more significantly on Japanese Sumo Wrestler as artist based in Japan and fascinated by sports, media and interested on humorous aspect of entertainment industries.\n\nThe `Urgency of Proximate Drawing Photograph` (NinKi:UoPDP) is Firoz Mahmud`s one of art projects, started as anonymously. Gradually with the requests of curators and many of his friends, he started to exhibit in public spaces and major art venues. It was initially created for changing the meaning of visual images from the original photo images which Firoz took, collected or found to experiment that how general people react seeing each one's popular icons.\n\nFrom the inception when Firoz Mahmud exposed these drawing photographs, he focused anonymously without using his name at billboards, undergrounds, signage board or in other exhibition venues in Japan. He created this on-going art project in Tokyo since 2008 as his leisure time drawing doodle on newspapers, magazines, and found images. NinKi: Urgency of Proximate Drawing was first exhibited at the 9th Sharjah Art Biennial in 2009 in Sharjah, UAE. Gradually he exhibited in Museums, galleries and art spaces.Gradually with the requests of curators and many of his friends, he started to exhibit in public spaces and major art venues. One of his first projects of 'Urgency of Proximate Drawing' was exhibited as 'Rescued Stardom' project at the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art in Hiroshima Japan where he received a prize.\n\nFiroz focuses on celebrities in excited, playful, sporty and happy moments. He draws remarkable lines where they are about to fall or feel hard to gesture in the photographs. Their idolized appearances are highlighted by protective line drawings that display an awareness of the per-formative ethos of iconic expression. The lines underneath the falling position imply that the stardom can`t fall down from the gestures and positions that they are held in.\n\nThe project The NinKi: Urgency of Proximate Drawing Photograph has been featured in many newspapers and magazines. Many critics, artists and art specialists commented on Firoz's NinKi art project, for example:\n`Through a very unique point of view, Firoz focuses on a moment of people’s lives. Although his method is very simple, it reconstructs the space in a very strong way. His works give viewers a lot of excitement. ``- Ozawa Tsuyoshi, Artist based in Japan\nNew York City & Dhaka based writer & artist Naeem Mohaiemen wrote on his reviews in Depart art Magazine that, -\n\"Firoz's announced plan is to rescue icons from detritus, but something sinister is at play in these brutalist lines. The crazy cat's cradle across a former pugilist's face, a flesh-eating phantasm in its pre-animation wireframe, is channeling Tyson's unmoored, chaotic, fractured id.\n\n\" Firoz has artfully and humorously explored social and emotive issues through his \"NINKi :UoPDP\" Urgency of Proximate Drawings. I am surprised how he magically rescued the perturbed stars during their danger situation in the photographs. The drawing structures are drawn with geometric patterns that appear like protective hex symbols. All celebrities can eventually remain invincible in their popularity, protected by an uncanny force.\" \n- Lucy Birmingham is an American critic and journalist based in Tokyo, but her articles appeared in Japan Times, Time.com, Wall Street Journal, ARTFORUM Magazine, Artinfo.com, Artforum.com, ARTnews.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Fringe benefits include inclusion with the (USA)industry’s Motion Picture Industry Pension & Health Plans. Currently the production company is required to contribute 60 pensions hours per week, which equates to about 35-percent of the weekly gross wage. Most all POCs are hired an \"on-call\" weekly status and are basically paid a flat rate per week, no matter how many or few hours they work. Working conditions can vary on the medium (half-hour, hour-long television, reality, live, soap and feature) and daily hours can range from 8 to 16 hour days. The POC is often the first person in the office and the last to leave since they hold the responsibility of tending to the needs of the crew. \n\nMore recent attempts have been made by Local 871 to establish a scale rate for the POCs, but to date all have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe union has a relaxed jurisdiction over the position since it does not have an official job description for a POC. It also governs another junior position in the category called Assistant Production Coordinator or APOC, but again since it does not have an official job description in its bylaws, many studios are able to avoid hiring the APOC.\n"}

{"id": "14966929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14966929", "title": "Simulacrum", "text": "Simulacrum\n\nA simulacrum (plural: simulacra from , which means \"likeness, similarity\") is a representation or imitation of a person or thing. The word was first recorded in the English language in the late 16th century, used to describe a representation, such as a statue or a painting, especially of a god. By the late 19th century, it had gathered a secondary association of inferiority: an image without the substance or qualities of the original. Philosopher Fredric Jameson offers photorealism as an example of artistic simulacrum, where a painting is sometimes created by copying a photograph that is itself a copy of the real. Other art forms that play with simulacra include trompe-l'œil, pop art, Italian neorealism, and French New Wave.\n\nSimulacra have long been of interest to philosophers. In his \"Sophist\", Plato speaks of two kinds of image making. The first is a faithful reproduction, attempted to copy precisely the original. The second is intentionally distorted in order to make the copy appear correct to viewers. He gives the example of Greek statuary, which was crafted larger on the top than on the bottom so that viewers on the ground would see it correctly. If they could view it in scale, they would realize it was malformed. This example from the visual arts serves as a metaphor for the philosophical arts and the tendency of some philosophers to distort truth so that it appears accurate unless viewed from the proper angle. Nietzsche addresses the concept of simulacrum (but does not use the term) in the \"Twilight of the Idols\", suggesting that most philosophers, by ignoring the reliable input of their senses and resorting to the constructs of language and reason, arrive at a distorted copy of reality.\n\nPostmodernist French social theorist Jean Baudrillard argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right: the hyperreal. Where Plato saw two types of representation—faithful and intentionally distorted (simulacrum)—Baudrillard sees four: (1) basic reflection of reality; (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretence of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which \"bears no relation to any reality whatsoever\". In Baudrillard's concept, like Nietzsche's, simulacra are perceived as negative, but another modern philosopher who addressed the topic, Gilles Deleuze, takes a different view, seeing simulacra as the avenue by which an accepted ideal or \"privileged position\" could be \"challenged and overturned\". Deleuze defines simulacra as \"those systems in which different relates to different \"by means of\" difference itself. What is essential is that we find in these systems no \"prior identity\", no \"internal resemblance\"\".\n\nAlain Badiou, in speaking with reference to Nazism about Evil, writes, \"fidelity to a simulacrum, unlike fidelity to an event, regulates its break with the situation not by the universality of the void, but by the closed particularity of an abstract set ... (the 'Germans' or the 'Aryans')\".\n\nRecreational simulacra include reenactments of historical events or replicas of landmarks, such as Colonial Williamsburg and the Eiffel Tower, and constructions of fictional or cultural ideas, such as Fantasyland at The Walt Disney Company's Magic Kingdom. The various Disney parks have by some philosophers been regarded as the ultimate recreational simulacra, with Baudrillard noting that Walt Disney World Resort is a copy of a copy, \"a simulacrum to the second power\". In 1975, Italian author Umberto Eco argued that at Disney's parks, \"we not only enjoy a perfect imitation, we also enjoy the conviction that imitation has reached its apex and afterwards reality will always be inferior to it\". This is for some an ongoing concern. Examining the impact of Disney's simulacrum of national parks, Disney's Wilderness Lodge, environmentalist Jennifer Cypher and anthropologist Eric Higgs expressed worry that \"the boundary between artificiality and reality will become so thin that the artificial will become the centre of moral value\". Eco also refers to commentary on watching sports as sports to the power of three, or sports cubed. First, there are the players who participate in the sport (the real), then the onlookers merely witnessing it, and finally the commentary on the act of witnessing the sport. Visual artist Paul McCarthy has created entire installations based on \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and theme park simulacra, with videos playing inside the installation.\n\nAn interesting example of simulacrum is caricature. When an artist produces a line drawing that closely approximates the facial features of a real person, the subject of the sketch cannot be easily identified by a random observer; it can be taken for a likeness of any individual. However, a caricaturist exaggerates prominent facial features, and a viewer will pick up on these features and be able to identify the subject, even though the caricature bears far less actual resemblance to the subject.\n\nBeer (1999: p. 11) employs the term \"simulacrum\" to denote the formation of a sign or iconographic image, whether iconic or aniconic, in the landscape or greater field of Thangka art and Tantric Buddhist iconography. For example, an iconographic representation of a cloud formation sheltering a deity in a thanka or covering the auspice of a sacred mountain in the natural environment may be discerned as a simulacrum of an \"auspicious canopy\" (Sanskrit: Chhatra) of the Ashtamangala. Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena approach a cultural universal and may be proffered as evidence of the natural creative spiritual engagement of the experienced environment endemic to the human psychology.\n\nThe Latinised plural \"simulacra\" is interchangeable with the anglicised version \"simulacrums\".\n\n\n"}

It is currently held and exhibited at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels.\n\nPainted in 1562, Bruegel's depiction of this subject is taken from a passage from the Book of Revelation (12, 2-9) and reveals the artist's profound debt to Hieronymous Bosch, especially in the grotesque figures of the fallen angels, shown as half-human, half-animal monsters. Together with \"Dulle Griet\" and \"The Triumph of Death\", which have similar dimensions, it was probably painted for the same collector and destined to become part of a series.\n\nThe composition with a central figure placed among many smaller figures was favoured by Bruegel at this time, not only in other paintings such as \"Dulle Griet\", but also in the series of engravings of the Vices and the Virtues which he had just completed for the Antwerp publisher Hieronymous Cock. The archangel Michael and his angels are shown by Bruegel in the act of driving the rebel angels from Heaven. Pride was the sin which caused the fall of Lucifer and his companions, and the conflict of good and evil, vice and virtue, is a theme which recurs constantly in Bruegel's work.\n\n"}

It was not displayed until 1968, in part because anti-war sentiment was criminalized with the Espionage Act of 1917. It is in the collection of the Milwaukee Art Museum.\n\nIn 1918, O'Keeffe was in a state of depression and anxiety about the war and did not paint for three months. While she understood why it was important militarily, she found it at odds with humanism and basic Christian beliefs. O'Keeffe's brother, Alexius or Alexis, was stationed in a military camp in Texas before he shipped out for Europe during World War I. She visited him in the fall of 1917 before he was shipped overseas, and was anxious about his fate. He was one of the first soldiers sent to France and did not believe that he would return to the United States alive. In France war had become very dangerous due to chemical and technologically advanced weapons. Poisonous gases were used against troops, which could kill, blind, or severely injure them. High-powered and long-range guns could cause significant destruction. Submarines planted mines in the seas and airplanes dropped weapons from the sky.\n\nO’Keeffe found herself at odds with people in Canyon about the war and was discouraged by attempts to glorify it. She tried to persuade her male students to continue their education, rather than fight in the war and she also wanted authorities to create a course for young men about the reasons and causes of war before they engaged in battle. She created a stir when she asked a shop owner to remove Christmas cards from his shop that expressed anti-German sentiment. O'Keeffe became quite ill from influenza during the 1918 flu pandemic, which had killed an estimated 20 million people worldwide, and took a leave of absence from her teaching position at the West Texas State Normal College in early 1918 to recuperate at a friend's ranch in San Antonio, where she painted \"The Flag\".\n\n\"The Flag\", both a political statement and a reflection of her fears, is a red streak \"bleeding into bruise-colored clouds\". In December 1917, she wrote that she felt compelled for the first time to paint from a sense of necessity. Her image for the painting was of a flag floating in the wind, similar to a tremble. Author Roxana Barry Robinson states, \"O'Keeffe sets a drooping flag against a starless, darkening sky. The flag flutters limply, stripped of its stars and stripes; its only color, and that of the pole, is blood red.\" Alexis died in France due to the effects of mustard gas.\n\nAnti-war sentiment was criminalized with the Espionage Act of 1917, and people living in Canyon were uneasy due to her anti-war position. \"The Flag\" was in the private collection of Mrs. Harry Lynde Bradley in October 25, 1968, when it was part of a Milwaukee Art Museum exhibition, and was acquired by the museum in 1977. The painting is included in the \"World War I and American Art\" exhibition opened by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in January 2017. After about a four-month run it will travel to the New-York Historical Society, where it will be shown until September 3, 2017.\n"}
{"id": "29499265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29499265", "title": "Tim Burton's unrealized projects", "text": "Tim Burton's unrealized projects\n\nThe following is a list of unproduced Tim Burton projects, in roughly chronological order. During a career that has spanned over 30 years, Tim Burton has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction.\n\nBurton was originally attached to direct the 1985 film \"After Hours\", but Martin Scorsese read the script at a time when he was unable to get financial backing to complete \"The Last Temptation of Christ\", which was finally completed in 1988; Burton gladly stepped aside when Scorsese expressed interest in directing \"After Hours\".\n\nAfter the 1985 film, Burton was offered the opportunity to direct \"Big Top Pee-wee\", but had no interest and was already working on his own pet project, \"Beetlejuice\".\n\nAfter the success of \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" (1985), and before his hiring of \"Beetlejuice\" (1988), Warner Bros. sent Burton various scripts. He was disheartened by their lack of imagination and originality, one of them being \"Hot to Trot\" (1988).\n\nBurton held a fascination with Vincent Price films since his childhood. He first worked with the actor on the 1982 television film \"Hansel and Gretel\", and a second collaboration on the 1982 short film \"Vincent\". During the production of \"Edward Scissorhands\" (1990), in which Price portrayed the inventor, Burton conceived the idea of making an independent documentary film on the actor, using the working title \"Conversations with Vincent\". With self-financing from his own production company, Burton shot the film in black-and-white over a three-day period at the Vincent Price Gallery in East Los Angeles College in April 1991. In addition to Price, Roger Corman and Samuel Z. Arkoff were interviewed. \"Conversations with Vincent\" was stalled when Burton went to work on \"Batman Returns\" (1992), and after Price's death in October 1993. In December 1994 it was announced that Burton was returning to the hour-long documentary, now titled \"A Visit with Vincent\". Lucy Chase Williams, author of \"The Complete Films of Vincent Price\", was working as a consultant. The film likely would have been released in the direct-to-video market, but the project was ultimately abandoned and remains unfinished.\n\nBurton was offered the chance to direct \"Drop Dead Fred.\" He turned it down in favor of different projects.\n\nIn 1990, Burton hired writer Jonathan Gems for write a sequel to \"Beetlejuice\", entitled \"Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian\". However, nothing came of this project. In early 1991, Burton was still interested in directing the sequel, and hired Daniel Waters to rewrite the script, but the two decided to focus on \"Batman Returns\". By August 1993, producer David Geffen hired Pamela Norris (\"Troop Beverly Hills\", \"Saturday Night Live\") to rewrite the script. In 1996, Warner Bros. decided to hire Kevin Smith to write another script, but he turned down the offer to write the script of the unmade \"Superman Lives\". Smith later joked that his response was \"Didn't we say all we needed to say in the first \"Beetlejuice\"? Must we go tropical?\" In March 1997, Gems released a statement saying \"The \"Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian\" script is still owned by The Geffen Film Company and it will likely never get made. You really couldn't do it now anyway. Winona is too old for the role, and the only way they could make it would be to totally recast it.\n\nIn September 2011, Warner Bros. hired Seth Grahame-Smith, who collaborated with Burton on \"Dark Shadows\" and \"\", to write and produce a sequel to \"Beetlejuice\". Grahame-Smith signed on with the intention of doing \"a story that is worthy of us actually doing this for real, something that is not just about cashing in, is not just about forcing a remake or a reboot down someone's throat.\" He was also adamant that Michael Keaton would return and that Warner Bros. would not recast the role. Burton and Keaton have not officially signed on but will return if the script is good enough. Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, \"We talked for a couple of hours and talked about big picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros. It's a priority for Tim. [Michael's] been wanting to do it for 20 years and he'll talk to anybody about it who will listen.\" The story will be set in a real time frame from 1988; \"This will be a true 26 or 27 years later sequel. What's great is that for Beetlejuice , time means nothing in the afterlife, but the world outside is a different story.\n\nIn November 2013, Winona Ryder hinted at a possible return for the sequel as well by saying, \"I'm kind of sworn to secrecy but it sounds like it might be happening. It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later.\" Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, \"It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again.\" In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told \"Entertainment Weekly\" that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming \"Beetlejuice 2\" by the end of the year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\", Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, \"It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out [for a sequel], it's not the \"Beetlejuice\" trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet.\"\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, new wave rock band Sparks attempted to make the Japanese manga \"Mai, the Psychic Girl\" into a musical, with interest from Burton and Carolco Pictures, who purchased the film rights in August 1991. Carolco hoped Burton would start production in 1992, but he chose to work on \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" and \"Ed Wood\" for Touchstone Pictures. The option on the film rights eventually expired, and Burton dropped out. Francis Ford Coppola later developed the property in the late 1990s. In June 2000, Sony Pictures Entertainment started on a different project with Kirk Wong attached to direct. By February 2001, a script had been written by Lisa Addario and Joey Syracuse for Sony's Columbia Pictures. The release of \"The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman\", a radio musical by Sparks, in August 2009, was informed by the six years the band spent trying to get their \"Mai, the Psychic Girl\" produced. The album generated new interest, and gained a \"second wind\", vocalist Russell Mael explained. \"The music is all ready and we are hoping that this still might see the light of day.\" On May 18, 2010, Burton expressed renewed interest in adapting the property.\n\nMorgan Creek Productions originally wanted Burton to direct \"Stay Tuned\" because of his work on \"Beetlejuice\" and his art style, but Burton left the project to direct \"Batman Returns\", the sequel to his 1989 \"Batman\" film, and was replaced by Peter Hyams while having some of the art styles paying tribute to Burton.\n\nAfter the 1992 film \"Singles\" was released, which had Burton in a rare credited acting role, Warner Bros. Television tried to turn the film into a television series, but the project never materialized. The film's director Cameron Crowe claims that \"Singles\" inspired the television series \"Friends\".\n\nBefore Michael Crichton's novel \"Jurassic Park\" was published, Hollywood studios were highly interested in purchasing the film rights. This included Warner Bros. and Burton, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Richard Donner, and 20th Century Fox and Joe Dante. Universal Pictures acquired the rights in May 1990 for Steven Spielberg, resulting in the 1993 film adaptation.\n\nProducers Jon Peters and Peter Guber acquired the film rights to \"Mary Reilly\" in 1989, and optioned them for Warner Bros. with Roman Polanski as director. When Guber became CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment later that year, he moved \"Mary Reilly\" to Sony's sister company, TriStar Pictures, where Burton was approached to direct with Denise Di Novi to produce in 1991. Christopher Hampton was hired to write the screenplay, and Burton signed on as director in January 1993, after he approved over Hampton's rewrite. He intended to start filming in January 1994, after he completed \"Ed Wood\", but Burton dropped out in May 1993 over his anger against Guber for putting \"Ed Wood\" in turnaround. Stephen Frears was TriStar's first choice to replace Burton, and Di Novi was fired and replaced with Ned Tanen. The film ended up becoming the critically and commercially unsuccessful \"Mary Reilly\" in 1996, starring Julia Roberts and John Malkovich.\n\n\"Batman Returns\" would be the last film in the Warner Bros. \"Batman\" film series that featured Burton and Michael Keaton as director and leading actor. With \"Batman Forever\", Warner Bros. decided to go in a \"lighter\" direction to be more mainstream in the process of a family film. Burton had no interest in returning to direct a sequel, but was credited as producer. With Warner Bros. moving on development for \"Batman Forever\" in June 1993, a \"Catwoman\" spin-off was announced. Michelle Pfeiffer was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in \"Forever\" because of her own spin-off.\n\nBurton became attached as director, while producer Denise Di Novi and writer Daniel Waters also returned. In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct \"Catwoman\" or an adaptation of \"The Fall of the House of Usher\". On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his \"Catwoman\" script to Warner Bros., the same day \"Batman Forever\" was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, \"Turning it in the day \"Batman Forever\" opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. \"Catwoman\" is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script.\" In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer re-iterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects. The film labored in development hell for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by Ashley Judd. The film ended up becoming the critically panned \"Catwoman\" (2004), starring Halle Berry.\n\nDuring the early development of the cancelled \"Catwoman\" spin-off, Burton expressed his interest in directing the third installment of the \"Batman\" film series that began with \"Batman\" in 1989. The Monkees lead drummer Micky Dolenz was attached to star as the Riddler, the film's main antagonist. Also, Harvey Dent's transformation into Two-Face was supposed to occur in the film, with Billy Dee Williams reprising his role as Dent from the first film, after turning down the offer to appear in \"Batman Returns\". Along with these, Michelle Pfeiffer was attached to return as Catwoman, Marlon Wayans was attached to star as Robin, and Rene Russo was attached to star as Dr. Chase Meridian. However, when Warner Bros. observed that the script was just as gloomy as the previous film, they decided to put Joel Schumacher as the director of the third installment, leading to the release of \"Batman Forever\", in which Burton served as producer, without being able to contribute ideas.\n\nIn 1993, Burton was set to direct \"Cabin Boy\", but left to direct \"Ed Wood\". Adam Resnick eventually directed the 1994 film, with Burton in a producer role.\n\nIn 1994, Burton was close to directing an adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe short story \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" with a screenplay by Jonathan Gems; he chose to direct \"Mars Attacks!\" instead.\n\nBurton was to direct \"\", a western/monster film that was to star Clint Eastwood and Jack Nicholson, with a screenplay by Jonathan Gems; he chose to direct \"Mars Attacks!\" instead.\n\nBurton considered directing \"Go Baby Go\", a beach film in the style of filmmaker Russ Meyer, with a screenplay by Jonathan Gems; he chose to direct \"Mars Attacks!\" instead.\n\nBurton bought the rights to \"Geek Love\" by Katherine Dunn in the 1990s. The story, about a traveling circus that uses chemicals to create genuine freaks, seemed perfect for Burton, but there has been no word about it since. In an interview with Dunn, she stated, \"He's got the rights. That's half the battle right there. Though it no longer seems like something he'd do. It's a little too horror for him now in my opinion. Though I would love to see this film get made.\"\n\nAround 1995, writer Jonathan Gems wrote a screenplay for a film adaptation of \"Dinosaurs Attack!\", with Burton as director. However, both Burton and Gems came to the conclusion that the project was too similar to \"Jurassic Park\".\n\nIn 1996, when Burton was the CEO and founder of Walt Disney Animation Studios' stop-motion studio division Skellington Productions, he was going to produce the studio's planned third film, \"Toots and the Upside Down House\", that was based on the book by Carol Hughes where a young girl still grieving over the death of her mother goes to a fantasy world inside her home when her dad still won't pay attention to her, where goblins, fairies and sprites live while helping the fairies battle an evil Jack Frost. Burton was attached to produce it, while Henry Selick was set to direct it (marking the third collaboration between Selick and Burton), with the screenplay written by Steven Soderbergh and co-produced by Disney's film partner at the time Miramax, which would have made it the first original animated film made by the company. However, Disney shut down the film's production, along with Skellington Productions, after the poor box office results of \"James and the Giant Peach\".\n\nAfter Kevin Smith had been hired to write a new \"Superman\" film, he suggested Burton to direct. Burton signed on with a pay-or-play contract of $5 million and Warner Bros. set a theatrical release date for the summer of 1998, the 60th anniversary of the character's debut in \"Action Comics\". Nicolas Cage was signed on to play Superman, with a $20 million pay-or-play contract, believing he could \"reconceive the character\". Producer Jon Peters felt Cage could \"convince audiences he [Superman] came from outer space.\" Burton explained Cage's casting would be \"the first time you would believe that nobody could recognize Clark Kent as Superman, he [Cage] could physically change his persona.\" Kevin Spacey was approached for the role of Lex Luthor, while Christopher Walken was Burton's choice for Brainiac, a role also considered for Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman. Sandra Bullock, Courteney Cox and Julianne Moore had been approached for Lois Lane, while Chris Rock was cast as Jimmy Olsen. Michael Keaton confirmed his involvement, but when asked if he would be reprising his role as Batman from Burton's \"Batman\" films, he would only reply, \"Not exactly.\"\n\nFilming was originally set to begin in early 1998. Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith's script and the film entered pre-production in June 1997. Burton gave art director Sylvain Despretz a concept drawing for Brainiac, which Despretz claims was \"a cone with a round ball on top, and something that looked like an emaciated skull inside. Imagine you take Merlin's hat, and you stick a fish bowl on top, with a skull in it.\" Burton chose Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as his primary filming location for Metropolis, while start dates for filming were pushed back. For budgetary reasons, Warner Bros. ordered another rewrite from Dan Gilroy, delayed the film and ultimately put it on hold in April 1998. Burton then left to direct \"Sleepy Hollow\". Burton has depicted the experience as a difficult one, citing differences with producer Jon Peters and the studio, stating, \"I basically wasted a year. A year is a long time to be working with somebody that you don't really want to be working with.\"\n\nWhen the \"Goosebumps\" film was in early production and was going to be made by 20th Century Fox and DreamWorks, Burton was originally going to produce it in 1998, with the option to direct. However, the project fell through and was later sold to Sony Pictures Entertainment, resulting in the 2015 film directed by Rob Letterman.\n\nBurton developed a script for a remake of the 1963 science fiction B-film \"\" with writer Bryan Goluboff, but it went unproduced.\n\nAround this time, Burton considered directing a remake of the 1960 Italian horror film \"Black Sunday\".\n\n\"Tim Burton's Lost in Oz\" would be a television series based on L. Frank Baum's \"The Wizard of Oz\" book series. Burton would be its executive producer. A pilot episode was filmed in 2000, but the series became unproduced due to budget constraints.\n\nDuring the mid-2000s, Burton was scheduled to direct a film based on the famous \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\" franchise, with Jim Carrey portraying Robert Ripley and a script by \"Ed Wood\" scribes Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski; the film ran over budget however, and was shelved by Paramount Pictures. Burton moved on to direct \"\". On January 12, 2011, it was reported that Paramount had revived development of the film with screenwriter Eric Roth, with Carrey still attached.\n\nIn 2001, The Walt Disney Company began to consider producing a sequel to \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", but rather than using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation. Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. \"I was always very protective of \"Nightmare\" not to do sequels or things of that kind,\" Burton explained. \"You know, 'Jack visits Thanksgiving world' or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it... Because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it.\"\n\nAfter the financial success of \"Planet of the Apes\", Burton supposed that 20th Century Fox would hire him to make a sequel, that was planned to explain the cliffhanger ending of the first film, but instead the studio decided to reboot the franchise and in 2011, released \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\".\n\nIn 2002, Burton, Jim Steinman, and David Ives had worked on a theatre production called \"Batman: The Musical\". Steinman has revealed five songs from the musical. The first is the opening theme for \"Gotham City\" and the entry of Batman with his tortured solo \"The Graveyard Shift\"; followed by \"The Joker's Song (Where Does He Get All Those Wonderful Toys?)\", \"The Catwoman's Song (I Need All The Love I Can Get)\", \"We're Still The Children We Once Were\" (the climactic sequence) and \"In The Land Of The Pig The Butcher Is King\", sung by the corrupt blood-suckers ruling Gotham, covered on the Meat Loaf album \"\". After production was cancelled, these songs were released on the \"Batman: The Musical\" memorial site.\n\nOn July 11, 2005, Burton stated that he and Johnny Depp didn't have intentions of making a sequel to \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", based on the \"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator\" novel. Despite this, some elements of \"Great Glass Elevator\" were seen at the end of Burton's film.\n\nDuring production on the film \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", a broadway musical was planned to acompany it. The studio and Burton reiterated their interest in May 2003, however, the project was cancelled by the time the film was released.\n\nIn 2008, Paul Reubens approached Burton with one of two scripts and talked to Johnny Depp about the possibility of having him portray Pee-wee in a potential third film, but they both declined.\n\nIn an interview with \"9\" director Shane Acker: \"I think there is definitely room. I mean, the way we end the film, there is a slight suggestion that it may be a new beginning. And I think we could continue the journey from where we left off and see how these creatures are existing in a world in which the natural environment is coming back and perhaps even threatening them in some way. Do they make the decision to not affect it, or do they try to affect it in some way? And do they still try to hold on to that humanity within them or do they recognize themselves at being machines too and go off on a different trajectory? So there's lots of idea that I think that we could play with and make another story out of.\" \n\nNo plans for a sequel have been made, but possibilities were mentioned via the film's 2009 DVD commentary. Director Acker has also mentioned the possibility of a sequel being made because of the lack of darker animated films, claiming that everything is G- and PG-rated with little to no dark elements. In 2009 he said that he will continue to make darker animated films, either doing so with a sequel to \"9\" or original ideas for future films. Before the theatrical release of the film, Acker and Tim Burton stated they were open for a sequel, depending on how well the film was received. Since the film's home release, there have been no further mentions of a sequel, with Acker focusing on projects announced in 2012 (\"Deep\") and 2013 (\"Beasts of Burden\"), neither of which have been released as of December 2017.\n\nIn 2010, it was announced that Illumination Entertainment, in partnership with Universal Pictures, had acquired the underlying rights to the Addams Family drawings. The film was planned to be a stop-motion animated film based on Charles Addams's original drawings. Burton was set to co-write and co-produce the film, with a possibility to direct. In July 2013, it was reported that the film was cancelled. On October 31, 2013, it was announced in \"Variety\" that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer would be reviving \"The Addams Family\" as an animated film with Pamela Pettler to write the screenplay and Andrew Mittman and Kevin Miserocchi to executive produce the film and were in final negotiations with BermanBraun's Gail Berman and Lloyd Braun to produce. By October 2017, Conrad Vernon had been hired to direct the film, which he will also produce along with Berman and Alex Schwartz, based on a screenplay written by Pettler, with revisions by Matt Lieberman. The film is scheduled to be released on October 11, 2019.\n\nIn May 2010, DreamWorks announced that it had acquired the rights to a film adaptation of \"Monsterpocalypse\", a Kaiju-themed collectible miniatures game. The studio had approached Burton for the project. On July 19, 2010, it was confirmed that Burton was attached to direct, but the film went unproduced. However, on May 3, 2016, Warner Bros acquired the project and hired Fede Alvarez to direct and co-write the film with Rodo Sayagues.\n\nStage adaptation Walt Disney Theatrical was in early talks with Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton to develop \"Alice in Wonderland\" as a Broadway musical. Woolverton authored the screenplay for Disney's \"The Lion King\" and is also the Tony Award-nominated book writer of \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Aida\", and \"\". Burton would have also rendered the overall designs for the stage musical. Woolverton would have adapted her screenplay for the stage production. Direction and choreography would have been done by Rob Ashford. The musical was aiming to make its world-premiere in London. Since then, there has been no further developments.\n\nIn March 2011, it was announced that Burton was attached to direct a film of \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\", which was supposed to feature and be co-produced by Josh Brolin but the film has been scrapped.\n\nIn June 2011, it was reported that Burton was being considered to be selected as the director for \"\", the fifth installment of the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film series, but he chose to direct \"Frankenweenie\".\n\nBurton was briefly attached to direct \"Maleficent\" for Walt Disney Pictures in 2011, but chose to pursue \"Dark Shadows\" and \"Frankenweenie\" instead.\n\nOn December 7, 2011, Pfeiffer told MTV that she is hoping sequels will be made for the film. On May 8, 2012, \"Variety\" reported that Warner Bros. may want to turn \"Dark Shadows\" into a film franchise. On May 18, 2012, Collider mentioned that the ending of \"Dark Shadows\" lends itself to a possible sequel. When Burton was asked if he thought that this could be a possible start to a franchise, he replied, \"No. Because of the nature of it being like a soap opera, that was the structure. It wasn't a conscious decision. First of all, it's a bit presumptuous to think that. If something works out, that's one thing, but you can't ever predict that. The ending had more to do with the soap opera structure of it.\"\n\nRobert Downey Jr. enlisted Burton to direct a Warner Bros. retelling of \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" in 2012. Burton pursued \"Big Eyes\" and Ben Stiller was attached to direct.\n\nOn June 11, 2012, Shane Acker confirmed that Burton would work with Valve Corporation to create his next animated feature film, \"Deep\". Like \"9\", the film will take place in a post-apocalyptic world (although set in a different universe). \"Deep\" would of been another darker animated film, as Shane Acker has expressed his interest in creating more PG-13 animated films. Since then, there has been no further announcements. However, despite the silence from Acker, in January 2017, the Facebook profile of the character \"the Scientist\" was updated with a rather cryptic message. The profile had been inactive since 2009, leading some to speculate the teasing of a sequel.\n\nOn June 22, 2012, \"\", based on novel of the same name, was released to theaters, with Timur Bekmambetov as director and Burton in a producing role, leading to speculation that the sequel book \"The Last American Vampire\" would be adapted as well. However, due to the film bombing in the box office and poor critical receptions, talks of a sequel ceased.\n\nOn September 30, 2016, Burton's adaptation of \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\" was released, leading to speculation that the sequel novels (\"Hollow City\" and \"Library of Souls\") would be adapted as well. However, due to the mediocre box office returns of \"Peculiar Children\", talks of a sequel ceased.\n\n"}

He became president of the Royal Scottish Academy and was made a Royal Academician.\n\nAllan was born in Edinburgh, the son of William Allan Snr., macer, an officer of the Court of Session. He was educated at the High School, Edinburgh, under William Nicol (1744?-1797), the companion of Robert Burns. Showing an aptitude for art, he was apprenticed to a coach-painter, and studied under John Graham at the Trustees' Academy, with David Wilkie, John Burnet, and Alexander George Fraser.\n\nAfter a few years he came to London, and entered the schools of the Royal Academy. His first exhibited picture was a \"Gipsy Boy with an Ass\" (1803), in the style of John Opie. \n\nIn 1805 he travelled, by ship, to Russia, but was wrecked at Memel, where he raised funds for the remaining journey by painting portraits of the Dutch consul and others. He then proceeded overland to St. Petersburg, passing through a great portion of the Russian army on its way to Austerlitz. At the Russian capital he found friends, including Sir Alexander Crichton, physician to the imperial family. Having learned Russian, he travelled in the interior of the country, and spent several years in the Ukraine, making excursions to Turkey, Tartary, and elsewhere, studying the culture of Cossacks, Circassians, and Tartars, and collecting arms and armour. In 1809 his picture \"Russian Peasants keeping their Holiday\" was exhibited at the Royal Academy. \n\nHis wish to return home in 1812 had to be postponed due to the French invasion of Russia, many of the horrors of which he witnessed first-hand.\nAllan was able to return to Edinburgh in 1814, and, in 1815, his picture \"Circassian Captives\" attracted notice at the Royal Academy, though it did not find a purchaser. However, Sir Walter Scott, John Wilson (1785–1854) and his brother James (1795–1856), John Lockhart, and others, raised a lottery for it, with 100 subscribers at £10 10s. each, and the picture was won by Francis Wemyss-Charteris, 9th Earl of Wemyss. Allan remained in Edinburgh, and though his pictures (including \"Tartar Robbers dividing their Spoil\") did not find purchasers amongst his countrymen, some of them were bought by the Grand Duke Nicholas when he visited Edinburgh. Allan afterwards painted some scenes from Scottish history suggested by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, such as \"Death of Archbishop Sharpe\" and \"Knox admonishing Mary Queen of Scots\" (exhibited in 1823 and engraved by John Burnet). His \"Death of the Regent Murray\" (exhibited 1825) was purchased by the Duke of Bedford for 800 guineas, and gained the artist his election as an associate of the Royal Academy. \n\nIn 1826 he was appointed master of the Trustees' School, Edinburgh, an office which he held until a few years before his death.\nSoon afterwards Allan's health gave way, and he was threatened with blindness. To recuperate he went to Rome, and, after spending a winter there, proceeded to Naples, Constantinople, Asia Minor, and Greece. In 1826 he exhibited \"Auld Robin Gray\" and in 1829 \"Prophet Jonah\". In 1830 he returned to Edinburgh, restored to health. His picture \"Slave Market, Constantinople\" was purchased by Alexander Hill, the publisher, and \"Byron in a Fisherman's Hut after swimming the Hellespont\" (exhibited 1831) by R. Nasmyth, who also bought Allan's portraits of Burns and Sir Walter Scott, which were engraved by John Burnet.\n\nIn 1832 Allan was living at 8 Scotland Street in Edinburgh's New Town.\n\nIn 1834 he visited Spain and Morocco. In 1835 he was elected a Royal Academician, and in 1838, on the death of Sir George Watson, was made president of the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1841 he went to St. Petersburg, and in the same year succeeded Wilkie as limner to the queen in Scotland, an office which was, as usual, followed (in 1842) by a knighthood.\n\nIn 1843 Sir William exhibited \"Battle of Waterloo from the English side\", which was purchased by the Duke of Wellington. The next year he went again to St. Petersburg, where he painted, for the Czar, \"Peter the Great teaching his Subjects the Art of Shipbuilding\". The last large work which he finished was a second view of the battle of Waterloo, this time from the French side. It was exhibited at Westminster Hall in 1846, in competition for the decorations of the Houses of Parliament, but was unsuccessful. He visited Germany and France in 1847.\n\nIn his final years Sir William lived at 72 Great King Street, a substantial Georgian townhouse over five storeys, in Edinburgh's Second New Town. He died of Bronchitis at his Edinburgh home on 23 February 1850.\n\nAt the time of his death Sir William was engaged on a large picture of the Battle of Bannockburn.\n\nHe is buried in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh against the north wall of the original cemetery backing onto the late Victorian extension.\n\n\n\n\n"}
