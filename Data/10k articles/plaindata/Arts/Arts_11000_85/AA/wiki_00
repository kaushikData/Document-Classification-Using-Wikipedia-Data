Probably dating to the 8th century, with 9th-century alterations, it is an intricately designed, silver-gilt dress fastener that is closely related to a select group of brooches that were produced in Ireland and Britain during the 'golden age' of late Celtic art. The brooch has been in the British Museum since 1919, and is normally on display.\n\nThe brooch and pin were cast in silver with exquisite geometric and zoomorphic interlace patterns and inset with three green-glass cabochon gems (one of which is missing). Several moulded sections were used, although the main ring was cast in one piece, other goldsmith's techniques were used in the decoration. both front and back were partially gilded, with gold and gold foil also used in parts of the decoration. There may have been inset pieces of amber, which are now missing. There is decoration on both front and back, in rather different styles, a feature also found in the Tara Brooch and Hunterston Brooch. \nThis is one of a number of brooches which were made in the Irish \"pseudo-penannular\" style, with the ring fully closed (like the two just mentioned and the Londesborough Brooch), but later adapted to a true penannular brooch by cutting away the bridging section linking the large terminals. The pin, which moves freely around the ring between the terminals (see other picture), is broken but would have originally extended to at least double the brooch's diameter. It appears to be a replacement, made in Scotland, probably at the same time that the form of the ring was adapted, by cutting the bridge to make the brooch truly penannular.\n\nThe design and manufacture of the brooch mixes Celtic and Pictish styles - it may originally have been a gift from an Irish dignitary to his Scottish counterpart, who later repaired or embellished the brooch according to local tastes. The original provenance of the brooch is unknown, although it is conjectured that the brooch was found in Perthshire in Scotland as it was probably first owned by Gavin Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane, whose country estate was located in that county. The brooch was later donated to the national collection by Sir John Ramsden, following the sale of the Breadalbane Collection in 1917.\n\n\n"}

The city, later renamed Constantinople and the present day Istanbul, was capital of the Eastern Roman Empire and survived for a thousand years after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. The gardens of Byzantium were, however, mostly destroyed after the 15th-century Turkish conquest of the city.\n\nByzantine gardens were based largely on Roman ideas emphasizing elaborate mosaic designs, a typical classical feature of formally arrayed trees and built elements such as fountains and small shrines. These gradually grew to become more elaborate as time passed. Byzantine gardens have influenced Islamic gardens and particularly moorish gardens (because Spain was before a Byzantine province, Hispania Baetica.\n\nLittle else is known about Byzantine gardens, however, and very few references, let alone entire treatises, exist on the subject. The Byzantines, like their Greco-Roman predecessors, attached great importance to such matters of aesthetics. However, ancient Greek gardens and Roman gardens were more developed and documented.\n\nDuring the last 250 years of Greek rule, ending in 1453, conditions drastically curtailed the tradition, which stretched back to Hellenistic times, of building luxurious villas, mostly outside the cities, with pleasing gardens, as appear in mosaics and frescoes or are recorded in texts. This period seems to have been less thoroughly investigated than have most earlier periods, and a concentration on it should produce a more coherent picture than another attempt to cover the whole span of Byzantine history.\n\n"}
{"id": "27380847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27380847", "title": "Color killer", "text": "Color killer\n\nThe color killer is an electronic stage in color TV receiver sets which acts as a cutting circuit to cut off the color amplifiers when the TV receives a monochrome signal.\n\nWhen a receiver is tuned to a monochrome transmission, the displayed scene should have no color components. However, there are two factors which result in color display even during monochrome transmission:\n\nWhen the frequencies of these signals equals the frequency of the color subcarrier wave, they may create an irritating color dot pattern like \"confetti\", which interferes with the monochrome picture.\n\nIn a color TV waveform, a reference pulse, called the burst, is transmitted along the back porch portion of the video signal. If the transmitted signal is monochromatic, then the burst is not transmitted. The color killer is actually a muting circuit in the chroma section which supervises the burst and turns off the color amplifiers if no burst is received (i.e. when the received signal is monochromatic.)\n\nIn NTSC and PAL transmissions, the color TV signal can be represented as:\n\nIn this equation formula_2 and formula_3 are attenuation factors, formula_4 is the luminance signal, formula_5 and formula_6 are the so-called color difference signals and formula_7 is the angular frequency of the color carrier. formula_7 is within the luminance bandwidth.\n\nIn the '70s, the Israeli government considered the import of color televisions as frivolous and a luxury that would increase social gaps. Therefore, the government ordered the Israel Broadcasting Authority to cease broadcasting in color. As it was impractical to strip out the chrominance signal from material recorded in color, this was accomplished by simply omitting the burst phase signal from the broadcast. The \"damaged\" signal triggered the \"color killer\" mechanism, installed in color TV sets to prevent the appearance of color. This method was named \"Mehikon\" ( \"eraser\").\n\nSoon after its introduction of the \"Color eraser\", special TV sets with an \"Anti-Mehikon\" ( \"anti-eraser\") device were offered. This device re-constructed the burst phase signal according to several known standards. The client had to turn a knob until the pictures on the screen appeared in natural colors. According to a report in \"Yediot Aharonoth\" from January 1979, clients had to adjust the knob every 15 minutes on average in normal conditions, or up to 10 times an hour when special problems occurred, in order to restore natural colors or if the picture suddenly turned black and white.\n\nBased on information from owners of electricity appliance stores, the report estimated that 90% of those who bought color TV sets also bought the \"Anti-Mehikon\" device, which added about 5–10% to the price of the television.\n\nEventually, the Mehikon idea was proven to be futile, and the Israeli television stopped using it in 1980, allowing color transmissions to be received freely.\n"}

It opened in 1577, and continued staging plays until 1624.\n\nThe Curtain was built some south of London's first playhouse, The Theatre, which had opened a year before, in 1576. It was called the \"Curtain\" because it was located near a plot of land called Curtain Close, not because of the sort of front curtain associated with modern theatres, but of its proximity of the City walls, curtain or curtain wall referring to the part of city walls between two bastions. Its remains were rediscovered in archaeological excavation in 2012. The most significant find was that the Curtain was rectangular not round. They found a stage, and evidence of a tunnel under the stage and galleries at the first floor level. Finds included a ceramic bird whistle; ceramic money boxes for collecting entry fees; beads likely for decorating stage costumes and a small statue of Bacchus.\n\nThe Curtain Theatre was built in 1577 in Shoreditch, and was London's second playhouse. Little is known of the companies that performed there, or of the plays they performed. The first clear mention of the Curtain is in 1584, when the City of London petitioned the parish of Shoreditch to shut down their playhouses. The proprietor appears to have been Henry Lanman, described as a \"gentleman\": in 1585, Lanman made an agreement with the proprietor of the Theatre, James Burbage, to use the Curtain as a supplementary house, or \"easer,\" to the more prestigious older playhouse. From 1597 to 1599, it became the premier venue of Shakespeare's Company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, who had been forced to leave their former playing space at The Theatre after the latter closed in 1596. It was the venue of several of Shakespeare's plays, including \"Romeo and Juliet\" (which gained \"Curtain plaudits\") and \"Henry IV\" Part I and Part II. The Lord Chamberlain's Men also performed Ben Jonson's \"Every Man in His Humour\" here in 1598, with Shakespeare in the cast. Later that same year Jonson gained a certain notoriety by killing actor Gabriel Spencer in a duel in nearby Hoxton Fields.\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain's Men departed the Curtain when the Globe Theatre, which they built to replace the Theatre, was ready for use in 1599. For seven years Henry Lanman (owner of the Curtain) had an agreement with James Burbage (owner of the Theatre) that all profit would be shared between them. This deal is how many believe Lanman was able to afford to open the Curtain, the rest is all very unclear. J. Leeds Barroll focuses in \"Shakespeare studies: An annual gathering of Research, Criticism and Reviews\" on the fact that Henry Lanman had offered the Curtain as an easer to James Burbage, proprietor of the Theatre. Thereby, he assumes that Lanman’s business, the Curtain, must have been doing as well as Burbage’s business, the Theatre, since both, Lanman and Burbage, had agreed on a pooling arrangement for seven years in 1585, to pool profits. As far as is known, Lanman ran the Curtain as a private concern for the first phase of its existence; He died in 1606 and it is assumed by Edmund Chambers that the theatre had been re-arranged into a shareholder’s enterprise before his death at some point. Thomas Pope, one of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, owned a share in the Curtain and left it to his heirs in his last will and testament in 1603. King's Men member John Underwood did the same in 1624. The fact that both of these shareholders belonged to Shakespeare's company may indicate that the re-organization of the Curtain occurred when the Lord Chamberlain's Men were acting there. Otherwise, it would be very unwise of Burbage to pool profits if he did better in the first place. Thus, the suggestion is given that both proprietors were doing equal business. Burbage's father Richard had shares in the theatre at the time of his death.\n\nThe London theatres, including the Curtain, were closed for much of the period from September 1592 to April 1594 due to the bubonic plague. In 1597, people wrote to the local magistrates' court demanding that no plays take place at the Curtain or the Theatre that year. The Curtain was named in John Stow's \"Survey of London\" in 1598, but was not listed in the 1603 edition. In 1600, the Privy Council tried unsuccessfully to shut down the Curtain theatre, and in 1603, the Curtain became the playhouse of Queen Anne's Men (formerly known as Worcester's Men, and formerly at the Rose Theatre, where they'd played Heywood's \"A Woman Kill'd With Kindness\" in February of that year). In 1607, \"The Travels of the Three English Brothers,\" by Rowley, Day, and Wilkins, was performed at the Curtain.\n\nThe Curtain was in use from 1577 until at least 1624, after which its ultimate fate is obscure as there is no record of it after 1627. The reasons for its closure are not known.\n\nThe Curtain was believed to have been built near The Theatre, but the exact location was for many years unknown. However, a commemorative plaque was erected at 18 Hewett Street.\n\nIn 2012, archaeologists from MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology) announced that they had discovered the remains of the theatre during trial excavations. In 2013 plans were submitted to develop the site with a 40-storey tower of 400 apartments plus Shakespeare museum, 250-seat outdoor auditorium and park, with the archaeological remains visible in a glass enclosure. Completion of the project is expected in 2019.\n\nIn May 2016, excavators announced that the theatre was purpose built and, unusually, the theatre was rectangular rather than round or polygonal. Walls survived up to high in places; MOLA identified the courtyard, where theatregoers stood, and the inner walls, which held the galleries. The theatre had timber galleries with mid and upper areas for wealthier audience members, and a courtyard made from compacted gravel for those with less to spend. The galleries were straight.\n\nAlso uncovered was a fragmentary ceramic bird whistle, dating from the late 16th century. This raised the question of whether the bird whistle was merely a Tudor toy or a prop for plays that needed sound effects. In November 2016, a tunnel structure - accessed by doors on either end of the stage - was unearthed, which would have allowed actors to exit from one side and come on again from the other without being seen by the audience. Fragments of ceramic money boxes were found, which would have been used to collect entry fees from theatregoers, before being taken to an office to be smashed and the money counted - this office was known as the ‘box office’, which is the origin of the term we use today.\n\nGlass beads and pins were unearthed along with drinking vessels and clay pipes. The team also came across a mount and a token, as well as personal items, including a bone comb.\n\nA reconstruction of the Curtain Theatre features in the 1998 film \"Shakespeare in Love\".\n\n\n"}

While highly formalist and idiosyncratic (notably in her lack of dialogue and very stylized mise-en-scene), Sciamma's filmmaking, beginning with \"Water Lilies\" relates closely to the characteristics of first-time filmmaking in France, notably in its emphasis on coming-of-age films focused on adolescents or pre-adolescents. Sciamma is very interested, moreover, in the fluidity of gender and sexual identity among girls during this formative period.\n\nSciamma was raised in Cergy-Pontoise, a suburb outside of Paris. Her father Dominique Sciamma is a software designer, and her brother Laurent Sciamma is a stand-up performer and graphic designer. \n\nBefore attending La Fémis, Sciamma studied literature. As a child she was an avid reader and became interested in film as a teenager. She wrote her first original script for \"Water Lilies\" as part of her final evaluation at La Fémis. Xavier Beauvois, who was chairman of the evaluation panel, persuaded her to make the film. A year after finishing school she began shooting the film in her hometown.\n\nHer debut film \"Water Lilies\" was selected for screening in the section \"Un certain regard\" at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. The film secured three nominations for the 2008 César Awards; Sciamma was nominated for the 2008 César Award for Best Debut, and actresses Adèle Haenel and Louise Blachère were both nominated for the 2008 César Award for Most Promising Actress.\n\nSciamma directed her first short film \"Pauline\" in 2009 as part of a government anti-homophobia campaign called ‘Five films against homophobia’.\n\nHer 2011 film \"Tomboy\" was written and shot in a matter of months. Sciamma wrote the script in three weeks, completed casting in three weeks, and shot the film in 20 days. It premiered at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival in the Panorama section of the festival. The film was shown in French schools as part of an educational program. \n\nHer 2014 film \"Girlhood\" was selected to be screened as part of the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. The film was also played at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival and the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. In interviews Sciamma stated that \"Girlhood\" would be her last coming-of-age film and she considered it, along with \"Water Lilies\" and \"Tomboy\", a trilogy.\n\nIn between directing her own films, Sciamma continues to work as a screenwriter for other directors. She was sought after by André Téchiné, whose work Sciamma admired as a youth, to co-write the screenplay for his 2016 film \"Being 17\". \n\nHer fourth feature film titled \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire\" is set to begin shooting in Autumn 2018 with a anticipated release in 2019. \n\nSince 2015, Sciamma has served as the co-president of the SRF (Society of Film Directors). \n\nIn 2014, Sciamma was in a relationship with the actress Adele Haenel whom she met on the set of \"Water Lilies\". Haenel publicly acknowledged their relationship in her acceptance speech for her César award in 2014. Their relationship continued as of 2017. \n\nSciamma is a feminist. She participated in the women’s protest against inequality at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival alongside many notable women in film including Agnes Varda.\n\nSciamma frequently collaborates with Para One who has scored all her films and who has directed scripts written by Sciamma in the past.\n\nShe frequently collaborates with cinematographer Crystel Fournier. \n\nShe is noted for casting non-professional actors in her films.\n\nSciamma has said that fashion and style form an important part of characterization which is why though uncredited, she works as the costume designer for all her films.\n\n"}

The camps were built in the mid-1st century. Later, under Trajan, the camps, which had originally only been surrounded by earthen embankments, were also enclosed by stone walls.\n\nA Roman road, the Danube Way () was laid along the \"Limes\", which linked the stations, camps and forts as far as the Danube delta.\n\nBecause of the sheer length of this border, the Danubian Limes is often divided into the following subdivisions:\n\nThe oldest Roman camp in Austria was Carnuntum. Fourteen kilometres away to the west an auxiliary fort (\"Hilfskastelle\") was built near Schlögen (today in the municipality of Haibach ob der Donau) in Upper Austria. At that time, the \"limes\" ran from Vienna to Linz roughly following the present-day Wiener Straße (\"B 1\").\n\nBecause the Danube did not always provide adequate protection, bridgeheads were built on its northern banks against the Marcomanni, such as the one in Stillfried or at the Oberleiser Berg. However, these were cleared again under Marcus Aurelius' son, Commodus, and a seven-kilometre-wide 'death strip' was laid along the Danube.\n\nThe increasing number of fortifications that were falling into decay were renovated again under Emperor Valentinian I (364–375) and upgraded to the conform to the latest military tactics. Walls were thickened, and defensive ditches renewed. In addition, towers were built along the walls, such as a watchtower discovered near Oberranna in 1960. These fortifications lasted only another hundred years before the fall of the Roman Empire. In 488 the land of present-day Austria was cleared. The Roman fortifications along the lower courses of the Danube were overhauled once again, especially under Anastasios I and Justinian I They finally served during Maurice's Balkan campaigns his successor, Phocas, as a basis for larger military operations and some were maintained in the province of Moesia Secunda until the invasion of the Bulgars in 679.\n\nA few defensive towers survive: in Bacharnsdorf in Lower Austria, in Mautern (Favianis) and in Traismauer (Augustiana). In Tulln and Zeiselmauer, too, there are surviving remnants. In the Kürnberg Forest near Linz there are remains of a watchtower from the Roman period.\n\nLegion camps were established in:\n\nCamps (\"castrae\") and forts (\"castella\") in Austria from west to east:\n\nOn the Lower Danube, between the present-day Bulgaria and Romania, the Lower Danubian Road was built under Emperor Tiberius in the 1st century AD on the Bulgarian side of the river.\n\nRoman camps, smaller garrisons and watchtowers were built on both sides of the Danube. Civilian settlements, predominantly for veterans and former legionaries were also built. The following Roman garrisons were the first to be established during the 1st century on the Lower Danube:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "544080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=544080", "title": "Dithyramb", "text": "Dithyramb\n\nThe dithyramb (, \"dithyrambos\") was an ancient Greek hymn sung and danced in honor of Dionysus, the god of wine and fertility; the term was also used as an epithet of the god: Plato, in \"The Laws\", while discussing various kinds of music mentions \"the birth of Dionysos, called, I think, the dithyramb.\" Plato also remarks in the \"Republic\" that dithyrambs are the clearest example of poetry in which the poet is the only speaker.\n\nHowever, in The Apology Socrates went to the dithyrambs with some of their own most elaborate passages, asking their meaning but got a response of, \"Will you believe me?\" which \"showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them.\"\n\nPlutarch contrasted the dithyramb's wild and ecstatic character with the paean. According to Aristotle, the dithyramb was the origin of Athenian tragedy. A wildly enthusiastic speech or piece of writing is still occasionally described as \"dithyrambic\".\n\nDithyrambs were sung by choirs at Delos, but the literary fragments that have survived are largely Athenian. In Athens, dithyrambs were sung by a Greek chorus of up to fifty men or boys dancing in circular formation, who may or may not have been dressed as Satyrs, probably accompanied by the \"aulos\". They would normally relate some incident in the life of Dionysus or just celebrate wine and fertility.\n\nThe ancient Greeks laid out the criteria of the dithyramb as follows:\n\nCompetitions between groups singing and dancing dithyrambs were an important part of the festivals of Dionysis, such as the Dionysia and Lenaia. Each tribe would enter two choirs, one of men and one of boys, each under the leadership of a \"coryphaeus\". The names of the winning teams of dithyrambic contests in Athens were recorded. The successful \"choregos\" would receive a statue that would be erected—at his expense—as a public monument to commemorate the victory. However, most of the poets remain unknown.\n\nThe earliest mention of dithyramb, found by Sir Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge, is in a fragment of Archilochus, who flourished in the first half of the seventh century BCE: \"I know how to lead the fair song of the Lord Dionysus, the dithyramb, when my wits are fused with wine.\" As a literary composition for chorus, their inspiration is unknown, although it was likely Greek, as Herodotus explicitly speaks of Arion of Lesbos as \"the first of men we know to have composed the dithyramb and named it and produced it in Corinth\".\n\nThe word \"dithyramb\" has no known origin, but is frequently assumed to not be derived from Greek. An old hypothesis is that the word is borrowed from Phrygian or Pelasgian, and literally means \"Vierschritt\", i. e., \"four-step\", compare \"iamb\" and \"thriambus\", but H. S. Versnel rejects this etymology and suggests instead a derivation from a cultic exclamation. Dithyrambs were composed by the poets Simonides and Bacchylides, as well as Pindar (the only one whose works have survived in anything like their original form).\n\nLater examples were dedicated to other gods, but the dithyramb subsequently was developed (traditionally by Arion) into a literary form. According to Aristotle, Athenian tragedy developed from the dithyramb; the two forms developed alongside one another for some time. The clearest sense of dithyramb as proto-tragedy comes from a surviving dithyramb by Bacchylides, though it was composed after tragedy had already developed fully. Bacchylides' dithyramb is a dialogue between a solitary singer and a choir. It is suggestive of what tragedy may have resembled before Aeschylus added a second actor instead of the choir.\n\nIn the later 5th century BCE, the dithyramb \"became a favorite vehicle for the musical experiments of the poets of the 'new music'.\" This movement included the poets Timotheus of Miletus, Cinesias, Melanippides, and Philoxenus of Cythera. By the 4th century BCE the genre was in decline, although the dithyrambic competitions did not come to an end until well after the Roman takeover of Greece.\n\nDithyrambs are rare in English language literature. In German literature they appear more frequently, and from the 19th century several compositions were inspired by them.\n\nJohn Dryden's \"Alexander's Feast\" (1697) is a notable example of an English language dithyramb.\n\nFriedrich Schiller wrote a \"Dithyrambe\" in 1796. Friedrich Nietzsche composed a set of \"Dionysos-Dithyramben\" in 1888/89.\n\nFrom the 19th century dithyrambs appear frequently in classical music, as well in vocal as instrumental compositions.\n\nFranz Schubert wrote a song for bass voice based on Schiller's \"Dithyrambe\" ( 801, published as Op. 60 No. 2 in 1826). Schubert's earlier attempt at setting the same poem for a more extended vocal ensemble had remained unfinished (, 1813). Johann Friedrich Reichardt (in \"Schillers lyrische Gedichte\" volume 2, published around 1809) and Wilhelm Taubert (Op. 144 No. 2, 1864) were other composers setting Schiller's poem. Other composers basing vocal music on dithyrambs include Giuseppe Verdi (\"Brindisi\", No. 6 of his 1845 \"Album di Sei Romanze\"), and Max Bruch (Op. 39, 1871). Othmar Schoeck's 1911 \"Dithyrambe\", Op. 22 is based on an unnamed verse by Goethe.\n\nInstrumental dithyrambs were composed by Robert Volkmann and Hermann Ritter. Nikolai Medtner composed several dithyrambs, including a set of three for solo piano as his Opus 10. Additionally, the final movement of his first violin sonata carries the title, and the last of his \"Vergessene Weisen\" Op. 40 is a \"Danza ditirambica\".\n\nThe last movement of Igor Stravinsky's \"Duo Concertant\" for violin and piano is entitled \"Dithyrambe\". Richard Edward Wilson's 1983 \"Dithyramb\" is for oboe and clarinet. Wolfgang Rihm composed a 30-minute work, \"Concerto\", in 2000, with the subtitle \"Dithyrambe\" and a scoring for string quartet and orchestra. \n\nIn 1961 the American choreographer James Waring created a dance piece entitled \"Dithyramb\" with music and objects by the Fluxus artist George Brecht.\n\n\n\n"}

It is her personal account of her experiences during the communist years.\n\nUntil the age of five, Loung Ung lived in Phnom Penh, one of seven children of a high-ranking government official. She was a precocious child who loved the open city markets, fried crickets, chicken fights and sassing her parents. While her beautiful mother worried that Loung was a troublemaker—that she stomped around like a thirsty cow—her beloved father knew Loung was a clever girl.\n\nWhen Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge army stormed into Phnom Penh in April 1975, Ung's family fled their home and moved from village to village to hide their identity, their education, their former life of privilege. Eventually, the family dispersed in order to survive. Because Loung was resilient and determined, she trained as a child soldier in a work camp for orphans whilst other siblings were sent to labour camps. As the Vietnamese penetrated Cambodia, destroyed the Khmer Rouge, the surviving siblings were slowly reunited. Bolstered by the shocking bravery of one brother, the vision of the others and sustained by her sister's gentle kindness amid brutality, Loung forged herself a new life.\n\nThe book was criticized by Bunkong Tuon for being inaccurate and, therefore, not being useful for historical research by Sody Lay, an American Cambodian reviewer. Reflecting on this negative review, Bunkong Tuon considers Sody Lay's review right and, at the same time, defends the memoirs as an emotional truth instead of a historical truth.\n\nThe book has been adapted into a movie that was produced and directed by Angelina Jolie. The film premiered on February 18, 2017 in Siem Reap, Cambodia.\n\n\"The heart of it is Loung's story\", Jolie states on the film. \"It's the story of a war through the eyes of a child, but it is also the story of a country\". To construct an accurate portrait of the genocide and war, Jolie used only Cambodian actors who speak their native language, Khmer. She gathered hundreds of survivors and their children to re-create their stories. The movie was filmed in Cambodia.\n\n"}

{"id": "7687345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7687345", "title": "Go God Go", "text": "Go God Go\n\n\"Go God Go\" is the twelfth episode in the tenth season of the American animated television series \"South Park\". The 151st episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 1, 2006. The episode is the first in a two-part story arc, which concludes with \"Go God Go XII\". \n\nIn \"Go God Go\", Cartman is unable to wait the three weeks until the Wii video game console is released, and attempts to freeze himself to get closer to the release date, but accidentally ends up much later in the future, in the atheistic world of 2546. Meanwhile, Ms. Garrison is forced to teach evolution to her students.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by \"South Park\" co-creator Trey Parker. The episode is a satire on atheism and mocks evolutionist Richard Dawkins, as well some arguments against religion.\n\nCartman is unable to wait three weeks until the Nintendo Wii console is released. In an attempt to enter cryonic suspension, he buries himself in the snow at the top of Mount Elbert, with help from Butters.\n\nConcurrently, Mrs. Garrison resists being forced to teach the school's evolution curriculum. In response, the school hires evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins to present the evolution lesson. After some initial friction between the creationist Garrison and atheist Dawkins, a romantic interest soon develops. During their date, Dawkins refers to religion as an argument from ignorance, and Garrison announces that she is now an atheist. The two later have sex, and Garrison pushes Dawkins to the realization it is his duty to rid the world of religion and bring about peace with its abolition. Garrison begins to admonish students who express a belief in god, mocking that they likely believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster.\n\nBy this time, Cartman enters suspended animation, and a freak avalanche has buried his body. Cartman ultimately remains frozen for over five centuries, until being discovered and thawed out by members of the Unified Atheist League (UAL). In the year 2546, the entire world is atheistic and dedicated to rationality and science. Atheism is divided into several denominations. These factions are at war with each other over who has the right answer to \"the great question\".\n\nCartman is informed of the possible presence of a Nintendo Wii at the Museum of Technology in New New Hampshire. However, they mention that before they are willing to take him there, they require some information alluding to a person they believe he knew in his time: the founder of the UAL who helped initiate a great event that made the entire world atheist. Suddenly, the UAL comes under attack from a rival group, the United Atheist Alliance (UAA), and Cartman is taken captive aboard a UAA ship.\n\nThe UAA commander contacts yet another faction, the Allied Atheist Allegiance (AAA), who are made up solely of highly evolved sea otters. The Commander of the UAA boasts to the otters about their possession of Cartman, and of how because of this, they are now the atheists in control. This provokes a threatening response from the AAA.\n\nSeries co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone described the production of \"Go God Go\" and \"Go God Go XII\" as \"painful\", mainly because of how it deals with atheism. They spoke about how difficult it is to make such a subject humorous without seeming \"preachy\". For a time, the episode actually did end up feeling \"preachy\" because too many ideas and statements were present. To rectify this, large portions of the episodes that more reflected Parker and Stone's personal opinions were removed and replaced with less serious material.\n\nThe decision to do an episode with the theme of atheism was finalized when Penn Jillette emailed Parker and Stone expressing his disappointment in finding out that they are not atheists themselves. Parker and Stone's religion was questioned in an interview, which prompted Jillette's email. It was assumed that they were atheists, so in the interview they clarified that they were not strictly atheists. While this was happening, Parker was anticipating the release of the Nintendo Wii, so it was decided that this scenario would also be a theme in the episode.\n\nAt the end of \"Go God Go\", Cartman is sent to the future; Parker and Stone loved the idea, in-part because it presented the opportunity for easy-to-write material. However, they had essentially forced themselves to create another episode, which they partially disliked because it meant they'd have to write more material that concerns atheism when they felt they had done enough.\n\nSeveral aspects of both \"Go God Go\" and \"Go God Go XII\" pay homage to \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\", a science fiction adventure television series produced by Universal Studios. Richard Dawkins and his book \"The God Delusion\" is also parodied. Parker and Stone were very pleased with the work of the animation staff in regards to the designs of the scenes in the future, particularly praising them for accomplishing so much in the short amount of time that a \"South Park\" episode is produced.\n\nDan Iverson of \"IGN\" gave the episode a positive review, with a score of 9.0 out of 10, writing: \"Between the shocking Mrs. Garrison story and the hilarious Wii promotion by Cartman, we totally recommend watching this episode.\"\n\nThe week of November 5, 2006, a poll on Nintendo.com asked \"How bad do you want a Wii?\". The responses were \"Bad\", \"Way Bad\", and \"Worse than Cartman\", with the third choice receiving 80% of the votes. At Nintendo's 2007 Electronic Entertainment Expo press conference, a clip of the episode where Cartman tells his mother he must have a Wii was included in a montage of clips about the demand for the Wii. Nintendo also sent the \"South Park\" staff several free Wii consoles after the episode first aired.\n\nRichard Dawkins reacted to the two-part episode by saying, \"I'm buggered if I like being portrayed as a cartoon character buggering a bald transvestite. I wouldn't have minded so much if only it had been in the service of some serious point, but if there was a serious point in there I couldn't discern it.\" In a Q&A session at the Free Library of Philadelphia, Dawkins said: \"I would have thought they could at least have got an actor that could do a proper British accent. Now, if only I could be offered a cameo role in \"The Simpsons\", I could show that actor how to do a real British accent.\" Dawkins later made a cameo in \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Black-Eyed, Please\".\n\nWhen asked about the episode in a 2012 interview with \"Playboy\" magazine, Dawkins, who said it was the only episode of \"South Park\" he had seen, thought the fighting among the different atheist sects had \"a certain amount of truth in it\" and harbored a greater potential for satire. It reminded him of the Judean People's Front and the People's Front of Judea from the film \"Monty Python’s Life of Brian\", but felt that too much of the episode was devoted to ridiculing him by depicting him having sex with Ms. Garrison. He commented, \"That isn't satire because it has nothing to do with what I stand for. And the scatological part, where they had somebody throwing shit, which stuck to my forehead—that’s not even funny.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "3596898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3596898", "title": "Hindu views on monotheism", "text": "Hindu views on monotheism\n\nHinduism is a religion which incorporates diverse views on the concept of God. Different traditions of Hinduism have different theistic views, and these views have been described by scholars as polytheism, monotheism, henotheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, agnostic, humanism, atheism or non-theism.\n\nMonotheism is the belief in a single creator God who is almighty, omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent. Hinduism does not posit or require such a belief, and is considered a non-monotheistic religion by scholars of religion. Many traditions within Hinduism share the Vedic idea of a metaphysical ultimate reality and truth called Brahman instead. According to Jan Gonda, Brahman denoted the \"power immanent in the sound, words, verses and formulas of Vedas\" in the earliest Vedic texts. The early Vedic religious understanding of Brahman underwent a series of abstractions in the Hindu scriptures that followed the Vedic scriptures. These scriptures would reveal a vast body of insights into the nature of Brahman as originally revealed in the Vedas. These Hindu traditions that emerged from or identified with the Vedic scriptures and that maintained the notion of a metaphysical ultimate reality would identify that ultimate reality as Brahman. Hindu adherents to these traditions within Hinduism revere Hindu deities and, indeed, all of existence, as aspects of the Brahman. The deities in Hinduism are not considered to be almighty, omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent, and spirituality is considered to be seeking the ultimate truth that is possible by a number of paths. Like other Indian religions, in Hinduism, deities are born, they live and they die in every kalpa (eon, cycle of existence).\n\nIn Hindu philosophy, there are many different schools. Its non-theist traditions such as Samkhya, early Nyaya, Mimamsa and many within Vedanta such as Advaita do not posit the existence of an almighty, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God (monotheistic God), while its theistic traditions posit a personal God left to the choice of the Hindu. The major schools of Hindu philosophy explain morality and the nature of existence through the karma and samsara doctrines, as in other Indian religions.\n\nContemporary Hinduism can be categorized into four major traditions: Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, and Smartism. Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism worship Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi — the Divine Mother — as the Supreme respectively, or consider all Hindu deities as aspects of the formless Supreme Reality or Brahman. Other minor sects such as Ganapatya and Saura focus on Ganesha and Surya as the Supreme. A sub-tradition within the Vaishnavism school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic Dvaita, founded by Madhvacharya in the 13th-century (where Vishnu as Krishna is a monotheistic God). This tradition posits a concept of monotheistic God so similar to Christianity that Christian missionaries in colonial India suggested that Madhvacharya was likely influenced by early Christians who migrated to India, a theory that has been discredited by scholars.\n\nAccording to \"Rigveda 1.164.46\",<br>Transl: Klaus Klostermaier\n\nKrishnaism is a sub-tradition of Vaishnavism wherein Krishna is considered \"Svayam Bhagavan\", meaning 'Lord Himself' and it is used exclusively to designate Krishna as the Supreme Lord. Krishna is considered as an avatar (manifestation) of Vishnu himself or to be the same as Narayana. Krishna is recognized to be \"Svayam Bhagavan\" in the belief of Gaudiya Vaishnavism and Dvaita sub-school of Hindu philosophy, the Vallabha Sampradaya, in the Nimbarka Sampradaya, where Krishna is accepted to be the source of all other avatars, and the source of Vishnu himself.\n\nThe theological interpretation of \"\" differs with each tradition and the translated from the Sanskrit language, the term literary means \"Bhagavan Himself\" or \"directly Bhagavan.\" Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition often translates it within its perspective as \"primeval Lord\" or \"original Personality of Godhead\", but also considers the terms such as \"Supreme Personality of Godhead\" and \"Supreme God\" as an equivalent to the term \"Svayam Bhagavan\", and may also choose to apply these terms to Vishnu, Narayana and many of their associated avatars.\n\nGaudiya Vaishnavas and followers of the Vallabha Sampradaya Nimbarka Sampradaya, use the Gopala Tapani Upanishad, and the Bhagavata Purana, to support their view that Krishna is indeed the \"Svayam Bhagavan\". This belief was summarized by the 16th century author Jiva Goswami in some of his works, such as \"Krishna-sandarbha\".\n\nIn other sub-traditions of Vaishnavism, Krishna is one of many aspects and avatars of Vishnu (Rama is another, for example), recognized and understood from an eclectic assortment of perspectives and viewpoints.\n\nVaishnavism is one of the earliest single God focussed traditions that derives its heritage from the Vedas.\n\nA different Vaishnavism viewpoint, such as those in Sri Vaishnavism, opposing this theological concept is the concept of Krishna as one of the many \"avatar\" of Narayana or Vishnu. The Sri Vaishnavism sub-tradition reveres goddess Lakshmi with god Vishnu as equivalent, and traces it roots its roots to the ancient Vedas and Pancaratra texts in Sanskrit.\n\n\n"}

The site is listed as historic by The Michigan State Historic Preservation Office. It is also listed on The National Historic Register as part of the Howell Downtown Historic District.\n\nThe Howell Opera House is a Victorian-style building with a seating capacity of 1,000 people. Plans for the theater were drawn and executed by Detroit architect, Almon C. Varney at the cost of $10,000. Construction began in 1880 by Hunter and Holmes Contractors and doors were opened to patrons on December 30, 1881. The building is located at 123 W. Grand River.\n\nAs the central part of the town, the edifice served not only for artistic performances but as a venue for several local occasions such as high school commencement. The theater also served, for a short duration, as home to the Livingston County Circuit Court in 1889.\n\nThe Howell Opera House was first owned by the Stair Brothers, E.D. and Orin, who assumed ownership in 1884. The theater was later purchased by Arthur Garland in 1893 who utilized a portion of the space to produce custom-tailored suits.\n\nIn 1923, the building was closed by the fire marshal. This brought an end to its intended use as quarters for entertainment. For more than 70 years, The Howell Opera House served as storage for a local hardware store.\n\nIn 2000, The Livingston Arts Council purchased The Howell Opera House with plans to restore the patronage to function, once again, as a theater. Renovations began in 2001 with a slow start due to lack of funding. In 2007, the first installment of the development plan had been completed.\n\nRenovations were made solely to the first floor. These renovations include refinished flooring and walls as well as new stairways. Plans have also been made for restoration of the second floor which houses the stage and balcony.\n\nThe renovated first floor of the Opera House is now available to rent for special events such as weddings and parties.\n\n"}
{"id": "28866471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28866471", "title": "Hugo Award", "text": "Hugo Award\n\nThe Hugo Awards are a set of literary awards given annually for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. The awards are named after Hugo Gernsback, the founder of the pioneering science fiction magazine \"Amazing Stories\", and were officially named the Science Fiction Achievement Awards until 1992. Organized and overseen by the World Science Fiction Society, the awards are given each year at the annual World Science Fiction Convention as the central focus of the event. They were first given in 1953, at the 11th World Science Fiction Convention, and have been awarded every year since 1955. Over the years that the award has been given, the categories presented have changed; currently Hugo Awards are given in more than a dozen categories, and include both written and dramatic works of various types.\n\nThe Hugo Awards have been termed as \"among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing\". Works that have won have been published in special collections, and the official logo of the Hugo Awards is often placed on the winning books' cover as a promotional tool. The 2018 Hugos were presented at the 76th Worldcon, \"Worldcon 76\", in San Jose, California, on August 19, 2018. The 2019 awards will be presented at the 77th Worldcon, \"Dublin 2019: An Irish Worldcon\", in Dublin on August 19, 2019.\n\nFor lists of winners and nominees for each category, see the list of award categories below.\n\nThe World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) gives out the Hugo Awards each year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. The award is named after Hugo Gernsback, who founded the pioneering science fiction magazine \"Amazing Stories\" and who is considered one of the \"fathers\" of the science fiction genre. Works are eligible for an award if they were published in the prior calendar year, or translated into English in the prior calendar year. There are no written rules as to which works qualify as science fiction or fantasy, and the decision of eligibility in that regard is left up to the voters, rather than to the organizing committee. Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the WSFS constitution as instant-runoff voting with five nominees per category, except in the case of a tie. The awards are split over more than a dozen categories, and include both written and dramatic works.\n\nFor each category of Hugo, the voter may rank \"No Award\" as one of their choices. Voters are instructed that they should do so if they feel that none of the nominees are worthy of the award, or if they feel the category should be abolished entirely. A vote for \"No Award\" other than as one's first choice signifies that the voter believes the nominees ranked higher than \"No Award\" are worthy of a Hugo in that category, while those ranked lower are not.\n\nThe six works on the ballot for each category are the most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated. With the exception of 1956, the first years of the awards did not include any recognition of runner-up novels, but since 1959 all of the candidates have been recorded. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works in each category. Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and take place in a different city around the world each year.\n\nThe idea of giving out awards at Worldcons was proposed by Harold Lynch for the 1953 convention. The idea was based on the Academy Awards, with the name \"Hugo\" being given by Robert A. Madle. The award trophy was created by Jack McKnight and Ben Jason in 1953, based on the design of hood ornaments of 1950s cars. It consisted of a finned rocket ship on a wooden base. Each subsequent trophy, with the exception of the 1958 trophy, has been similar to the original design. The rocket trophy was formally redesigned in 1984, and since then only the base of the trophy has changed each year. There is no monetary or other remuneration associated with the Hugo, other than the trophy.\n\nRetrospective Hugo Awards, or Retro Hugos, were added to the ballot beginning in 1996. They are awards optionally given by a Worldcon for works that would have been eligible 50, 75, or 100 years ago.\n\nPrior to 2017, these could be awarded for the ten years that had a Worldcon where no Hugos were awarded: the conventions in 1939–41, 1946–52, and 1954. Retro Hugos under these rules were given five times: in 1996, 2001, and 2004 for 50 years prior, and 2014 and 2016 for 75 years prior. The Worldcons eligible in 1997–2000, 2002, and 2015 chose not to award Retro Hugos, and under these rules there would have been no more opportunities to award them until 2022 (for 1947). \n\nA 2017 rule change expanded the criteria to be any year after 1939 in which no Hugos were awarded, whether or not there was a Worldcon that year, or fifteen years in total: 1939–52 and 1954. Worldcon 76 and Dublin 2019 then jointly announced that Retro Hugos would be awarded in 2018 for 1943 and in 2019 for 1944.\n\nThe first Hugo Awards were presented at the 11th Worldcon in Philadelphia in 1953, which awarded Hugos in seven categories. The awards presented that year were initially conceived as a one-off event, though the organizers hoped that subsequent conventions would also present them. At the time, Worldcons were completely run by their respective committees as independent events and had no oversight between years. Thus there was no mandate for any future conventions to repeat the awards, and no set rules for how to do so.\n\nThe 1954 Worldcon chose not to, but the awards were reinstated at the 1955 Worldcon, and thereafter became traditional. The award was called the Annual Science Fiction Achievement Award, with \"Hugo Award\" being an unofficial, but better known name. The nickname was accepted as an official alternative name in 1958, and since the 1992 awards the nickname has been adopted as the official name of the award.\n\nIn 1959, though there were still no formal guidelines governing the awards, several rules were instated which thereafter became traditional. These included having a ballot for nominating works earlier in the year and separate from the voting ballot; defining eligibility to include works published in the prior calendar year, rather than the previous rule of the \"preceding year\"; and allowing voters to select \"no award\" as an option, which then won that year in two categories: Dramatic Presentation and Best New Author. The eligibility change additionally sparked a separate rule, prohibiting the nomination of works which had been nominated for the 1958 awards, as the two time periods overlapped.\n\nIn 1961, after the formation of the WSFS to oversee each Worldcon committee, formal rules were set down in the WSFS constitution mandating the presenting of the awards as one of the responsibilities of each Worldcon organizing committee. The rules restricted voting to members of the convention at which the awards would be given, while still allowing anyone to nominate works; nominations were restricted to members of the convention or the previous year's convention in 1963. The guidelines also specified the categories that would be awarded, which could only be changed by the World Science Fiction Society board. These categories were for Best Novel, Short Fiction (short stories, broadly defined), Dramatic Presentation, Professional Magazine, Professional Artist, and Best Fanzine (fan magazine). 1963 was also the second year in which \"no award\" won a category, again for Dramatic Presentation.\n\nIn 1964 the guidelines were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as up to two categories for that year. These additional awards were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but were not required to be repeated by future conventions. This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a few were ever awarded for more than one year.\n\nIn 1967 categories for Novelette, Fan Writer, and Fan Artist were added, and a category for Best Novella was added the following year; these new categories had the effect of providing a definition for what word count qualified a work for what category, which was previously left up to voters. Novelettes had also been awarded prior to the codification of the rules. The fan awards were initially conceived as separate from the Hugo Awards, with the award for Best Fanzine losing its status, but were instead absorbed into the regular Hugo Awards by the convention committee.\n\nWhile traditionally five works had been selected for nomination in each category out of the proposed nominees, in 1971 this was set down as a formal rule, barring ties. In 1973, the WSFS removed the category for Best Professional Magazine, and a Best Professional Editor award was instated as its replacement, in order to recognize \"the increasing importance of original anthologies\".\n\nAfter that year the guidelines were changed again to remove the mandated awards and instead allow up to ten categories which would be chosen by each convention, though they were expected to be similar to those presented in the year before. Despite this change no new awards were added or previous awards removed before the guidelines were changed back to listing specific categories in 1977. 1971 and 1977 both saw \"no award\" win the Dramatic Presentation category for the third and fourth time; \"no award\" did not win any categories afterwards until 2015.\n\nIn 1980 the category for Best Non-Fiction Book (later renamed Best Related Work) was added, followed by a category for Best Semiprozine (semi-professional magazine) in 1984. In 1983, members of the Church of Scientology were encouraged by people such as Charles Platt to nominate as a bloc \"Battlefield Earth\", written by the organization's founder L. Ron Hubbard, for the Best Novel award; it did not make the final ballot. Another campaign followed in 1987 to nominate Hubbard's \"Black Genesis\"; it made the final ballot but finished behind \"no award\". 1989 saw a work—\"The Guardsman\" by Todd Hamilton and P. J. Beese—withdrawn by its authors from the final ballot after a fan bought numerous memberships under false names, all sent in on the same day, in order to get the work onto the ballot.\n\nIn 1990 the Best Original Art Work award was given as an extra Hugo Award, and was listed again in 1991, though not actually awarded, and established afterward as an official Hugo Award. It was then removed from this status in 1996, and has not been awarded since. The Retro Hugos were created in the mid-1990s, and were first awarded in 1996.\n\nIn 2003, the Dramatic Presentation award was split into two categories, Long Form and Short Form. This was repeated with the Best Professional Editor category in 2007. 2009 saw the addition of the Best Graphic Story category, while the most recent change to the Hugo Awards was in 2012, when an award for Best Fancast was added.\n\nIn 2015, two groups of science fiction writers, the \"Sad Puppies\" led by Brad R. Torgersen and Larry Correia, and the \"Rabid Puppies\" led by Vox Day, each put forward a similar slate of suggested nominations which came to dominate the ballot. The Sad Puppies campaign had run for two years prior on a smaller scale, with limited success. The leaders of the campaigns characterized them as a reaction to \"niche, academic, overtly [leftist]\" nominees and the Hugo becoming \"an affirmative action award\" that preferred female and non-white authors and characters. In response, five nominees declined their nomination before and, for the first time, two after the ballot was published. Multiple-Hugo-winner Connie Willis declined to present the awards. The slates were characterized by \"The Guardian\" as a \"right wing\", \"orchestrated backlash\" and by \"The A.V. Club\" as a \"group of white guys\", and were linked with the Gamergate controversy. Multiple Hugo winner Samuel R. Delany characterized the campaigns as a response to \"socio-economic\" changes such as minority authors gaining prominence and thus \"economic heft\". In all but the Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form category, \"no award\" placed above all nominees that were on either slate, and it won all five categories that only contained slate nominees. The two campaigns were repeated in 2016 with some changes to the campaigns, and the \"Rabid Puppy\" slate again dominated the ballot in several categories, with all five nominees in Best Related Work, Best Graphic Story, Best Professional Artist, and Best Fancast.\n\nIn response to the campaigns, a set of new rules, called \"E Pluribus Hugo\", were passed in 2015 and ratified in 2016 to modify the nominations process. Intended to ensure that organized minority groups cannot dominate every finalist position in a category, the new rules define a voting system in which nominees are eliminated one by one, with each vote for an eliminated work then spread out over the uneliminated works they nominated, until only the final shortlist remains. These rules were ratified in 2016 to be used for the first time in 2017. A rule mandating that the final nominees must appear on at least five percent of ballots was also eliminated, to ensure that all categories could reach a full set of nominees even when the initial pool of works was very large. Each nominator is limited to five works in each category, but the final ballot was changed to six in each; additionally, no more than two works by a given author or group, or in the same dramatic series, can be in one category on the final ballot.\n\nIn 2018 the newest permanent category, Best Series, was begun; it was run the year prior as a special Hugo Award prior to being ratified at the business meeting.\n\nThe only discontinued awards which were instated in the WSFS constitution as permanent categories were the Best Professional Magazine and Best Original Art Work Hugo Awards. Worldcon committees may also give out special awards during the Hugo ceremony, which are not voted on. Unlike the additional Hugo categories which Worldcons may present, these awards are not officially Hugo Awards and do not use the same trophy, though they once did. An additional award, the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, is presented at the Hugo Award ceremony and voted on by the same process, but is not formally a Hugo Award. Another such award, for Best Young Adult Book, was first awarded in 2018.\n\nThe Hugo Award is highly regarded by observers. The \"Los Angeles Times\" has termed it \"among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing\", a claim echoed by \"Wired\", who said that it was \"the premier award in the science fiction genre\". Justine Larbalestier, in \"The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction\" (2002), referred to the awards as \"the best known and most prestigious of the science fiction awards\", and Jo Walton, writing for \"Tor.com\", said it was \"undoubtedly science fiction's premier award\". \"The Guardian\" similarly acknowledged it as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" as well as \"one of the most venerable, democratic and international\" science fiction awards \"in existence\". James Gunn, in \"The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\" (1988), echoed \"The Guardian\"s statement of the award's democratic nature, saying that \"because of its broad electorate\" the Hugos were the awards most representative of \"reader popularity\". Camille Bacon-Smith, in \"Science Fiction Culture\" (2000), said that at the time fewer than 1000 people voted on the final ballot; she held, however, that this is a representative sample of the readership at large, given the number of winning novels that remain in print for decades or become notable outside of the science fiction genre, such as \"The Demolished Man\" or \"The Left Hand of Darkness\". The 2014 awards saw over 1900 nomination submissions and over 3500 voters on the final ballot, while the 1964 awards received 274 votes. The 2015 awards saw 2122 nominating ballots and 5950 votes. The 2016 awards saw 4032 nominating ballots and 3130 votes.\n\nBrian Aldiss, in his book \"Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction\", claimed that the Hugo Award was a barometer of reader popularity, rather than artistic merit; he contrasted it with the panel-selected Nebula Award, which provided \"more literary judgment\", though he did note that the winners of the two awards often overlapped. Along with the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award is also considered one of the premier awards in science fiction, with Laura Miller of Salon.com terming it \"science fiction's most prestigious award\".\n\nThe official logo of the Hugo Awards is often placed on the winning books' cover as a promotional tool. Gahan Wilson, in \"First World Fantasy Awards\" (1977), claimed that noting that a book had won the Hugo Award on the cover \"demonstrably\" increased sales for that novel, though Orson Scott Card said in his 1990 book \"How to Write Science Fiction & Fantasy\" that the award had a larger effect on foreign sales than in the United States. Spider Robinson, in 1992, claimed that publishers were very interested in authors that won a Hugo Award, more so than for other awards such as the Nebula Award. Literary agent Richard Curtis said in his 1996 \"Mastering the Business of Writing\" that having the term Hugo Award on the cover, even as a nominee, was a \"powerful inducement\" to science fiction fans to buy a novel, while Jo Walton claimed in 2011 that the Hugo is the only science fiction award \"that actually affects sales of a book\".\n\nThere have been several anthologies of Hugo-winning short fiction. The series \"The Hugo Winners\", edited by Isaac Asimov, was started in 1962 as a collection of short story winners up to the previous year, and concluded with the 1982 Hugos in Volume 5. \"The New Hugo Winners\", edited originally by Asimov, later by Connie Willis and finally by Gregory Benford, has four volumes collecting stories from the 1983 to the 1994 Hugos. The most recent anthology is \"The Hugo Award Showcase\" (2010), edited by Mary Robinette Kowal. It contains most of the short stories, novelettes, and novellas that were nominated for the 2009 award.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2488188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2488188", "title": "Immram", "text": "Immram\n\nAn immram (; plural immrama; , , \"voyage\") is a class of Old Irish tales concerning a hero's sea journey to the Otherworld (see Tír na nÓg and Mag Mell). Written in the Christian era and essentially Christian in aspect, they preserve elements of Irish mythology.\n\nThe immrama are identifiable by their focus on the exploits of the heroes during their search for the Otherworld, located in these cases in the islands far to the west of Ireland. The hero sets out on his voyage for the sake of adventure or to fulfill his destiny, and generally stops on other fantastic islands before reaching his destination. He may or may not be able to return home again.\n\nThe immrama are generally confused with a similar Irish genre, the \"echtrae\" or \"adventure\". Both types of story involve a hero's journey to an \"otherworld\", whether a Christian paradise, a fairyland, the land of the gods or a utopia. They are distinguished by date; echtrai are older, dating from the 7th century, while the earliest immram dates only to the 8th century. David Dumville argues that the immrama include more Christian thinking than the more pagan genre of echtrae, and that, whereas the purpose of the echtrai is to enhance understanding of the old gods and the land in which they live, in an immram these pagan elements occur as a challenge to the hero's faith. In an echtrae the protagonist only ever goes to one location and may arrive in the otherworld with no explanation of the journey, whereas in an immram the hero always has multiple adventures on several islands.\n\nOriginally there were seven officially recognised Immram listed in a list of ancient texts. Of those seven only three survive: \"The Voyage of Mael Dúin\", \"The Voyage of the Uí Chorra\", and \"The Voyage of Snedgus and Mac Riagla\". \"The Voyage of Bran\" is classified in these same lists as an echtrae, though it also contains the essential elements of the immrama. The later Latin \"Voyage of St. Brendan\" also contains a voyage across the sea to various otherworldly islands.\n\nImmrama were first recorded as early as the 7th century by monks and scholars who fled Continental Europe before the barbarian invaders of the fifth century. These monks carried the learning of Western Europe and became the vanguard of the Christianizing of Europe. On this account it is expected that Immram have their origins in pre-existing Christian voyage literature, pre-existing Celtic legends, or classical stories the monks would have known. The origins of these stories are attributed to three sources of preexisting stories: Irish myths, Christian genres, and Classic Stories.\n\nThe Otherworld in \"The Voyage of Bran\" is a distinctly Celtic feature but this is easily overlooked because the concept of the Christian paradise and the British and Irish otherworld are closely related. This difference is highlighted in the difference between sinless and sexless in the native and Christian mindset, like in the existing translation where an author may have turned the \"Isle of Woman\" into a chaste society, with some difficulty. Such an example was with a passage that described a man and a woman playing under a bush without sin or blame. This passage in light of several others emphasises a Christian effort to create a sinless and sexless Otherworld.\n\nImmrama may have borrowed heavily from preexisting Christian genres, such as the \"sanctae vitae\" (saints' lives), the \"peregrinatio\" (pilgrimage stories), and the vision tales. As early as the 5th century Irish monks would go on a pilgrimage, a \"peregrination\", sailing from island to island seeking isolation where they would meditate and purge themselves of their sins. The source of inspiration behind the Immram may also be the Christian punishment of sending people adrift for their crimes to be judged by God. Perhaps the largest piece of evidence that immram are Christian works is that the characters in the story are generally wandering priests, monks, and nuns, or at least related to them.\n\nOne of the first Celticists, Heinrich Zimmerman, attempted to link the immram with the \"Aeneid\" and the \"Odyssey\". Some of the parallels they make are between the immortal women in the tales who bestow immortality on their lovers for the time they remain with them and the giant sheep on islands in both stories. These parallels have since been debunked by William Flint Thrall.\n\nOn top of their literary and mythological precedents, some scholars have argued that the immrama may be exaggerated retelling of historical voyages. The early Irish, particularly monks (see papar), were certainly far travelled, reaching the Orkney, Shetland, Faroe Islands at an early date and perhaps even reaching Iceland. Some places and things referenced in the immrama and the Brendan tale have been associated with real islands and real things, for instance Brendan's crystal pillar has been suggested to refer to an iceberg.\n\n\n\n\nThe popularity of \"The Voyage of St. Brendan\" inspired Tim Severin to undertake a voyage using 5th century technology to demonstrate that the early Irish could have made it as far as North America.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14724", "title": "Intellectual property", "text": "Intellectual property\n\nIntellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect, and primarily encompasses copyrights, patents, and trademarks. It also includes other types of rights, such as trade secrets, publicity rights, moral rights, and rights against unfair competition. Artistic works like music and literature, as well as some discoveries, inventions, words, phrases, symbols, and designs, can all be protected as intellectual property. It was not until the 19th century that the term \"intellectual property\" began to be used, and not until the late 20th century that it became commonplace in the majority of the world.\n\nThe main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a large variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they createusually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to profit from the information and intellectual goods they create. These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.\n\nThe intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is \"indivisible\" – an unlimited number of people can \"consume\" an intellectual good without it being depleted. Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.\n\nThe Statute of Monopolies (1624) and the British Statute of Anne (1710) are seen as the origins of patent law and copyright respectively, firmly establishing the concept of intellectual property.\n\nThe first known use of the term \"intellectual property\" dates to 1769, when a piece published in the \"Monthly Review\" used the phrase. The first clear example of modern usage goes back as early as 1808, when it was used as a heading title in a collection of essays.\n\nThe German equivalent was used with the founding of the North German Confederation whose constitution granted legislative power over the protection of intellectual property (\"Schutz des geistigen Eigentums\") to the confederation. When the administrative secretariats established by the Paris Convention (1883) and the Berne Convention (1886) merged in 1893, they located in Berne, and also adopted the term intellectual property in their new combined title, the United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property.\n\nThe organization subsequently relocated to Geneva in 1960, and was succeeded in 1967 with the establishment of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) by treaty as an agency of the United Nations. According to legal scholar Mark Lemley, it was only at this point that the term really began to be used in the United States (which had not been a party to the Berne Convention), and it did not enter popular usage there until passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980.\n\n\"The history of patents does not begin with inventions, but rather with royal grants by Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603) for monopoly privileges... Approximately 200 years after the end of Elizabeth's reign, however, a patent represents a legal right obtained by an inventor providing for exclusive control over the production and sale of his mechanical or scientific invention... [demonstrating] the evolution of patents from royal prerogative to common-law doctrine.\"\n\nThe term can be found used in an October 1845 Massachusetts Circuit Court ruling in the patent case \"Davoll et al. v. Brown.\", in which Justice Charles L. Woodbury wrote that \"only in this way can we protect intellectual property, the labors of the mind, productions and interests are as much a man's own...as the wheat he cultivates, or the flocks he rears.\" The statement that \"discoveries are..property\" goes back earlier. Section 1 of the French law of 1791 stated, \"All new discoveries are the property of the author; to assure the inventor the property and temporary enjoyment of his discovery, there shall be delivered to him a patent for five, ten or fifteen years.\" In Europe, French author A. Nion mentioned \"propriété intellectuelle\" in his \"Droits civils des auteurs, artistes et inventeurs\", published in 1846.\n\nUntil recently, the purpose of intellectual property law was to give as little protection as possible in order to encourage innovation. Historically, therefore, they were granted only when they were necessary to encourage invention, limited in time and scope. This is mainly as a result of knowledge being traditionally viewed as a public good, in order to allow its extensive dissemination and improvement thereof.\n\nThe concept's origins can potentially be traced back further. Jewish law includes several considerations whose effects are similar to those of modern intellectual property laws, though the notion of intellectual creations as property does not seem to exist – notably the principle of Hasagat Ge'vul (unfair encroachment) was used to justify limited-term publisher (but not author) copyright in the 16th century. In 500 BCE, the government of the Greek state of Sybaris offered one year's patent \"to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury\".\n\nAccording to Jean-Frédéric Morin, \"the global intellectual property regime is currently in the midst of a paradigm shift\". Indeed, up until the early 2000s the global IP regime used to be dominated by high standards of protection characteristic of IP laws from Europe or the United States, with a vision that uniform application of these standards over every country and to several fields with little consideration over social, cultural or environmental values or of the national level of economic development. Morin argues that \"the emerging discourse of the global IP regime advocates for greater policy flexibility and greater access to knowledge, especially for developing countries.\" Indeed, with the Development Agenda adopted by WIPO in 2007, a set of 45 recommendations to adjust WIPO’s activities to the specific needs of developing countries and aim to reduce distortions especially on issues such as patients’ access to medicines, Internet users’ access to information, farmers’ access to seeds, programmers’ access to source codes or students’ access to scientific articles. However, this paradigm shift has not yet manifested itself in concrete legal reforms at the international level.\n\nSimilarly, it is based on these background that the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement requires members of the WTO to set minimum standards of legal protection, but its objective to have a “one-fits-all” protection law on Intellectual Property has been viewed with controversies regarding differences in the development level of countries. Despite the controversy, the agreement has extensively incorporated intellectual property rights into the global trading system for the first time in 1995, and has prevailed as the most comprehensive agreement reached by the world.\n\nIntellectual property rights include patents, copyright, industrial design rights, trademarks, plant variety rights, trade dress, geographical indications, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets. There are also more specialized or derived varieties of \"sui generis\" exclusive rights, such as circuit design rights (called mask work rights in the US) and supplementary protection certificates for pharmaceutical products (after expiry of a patent protecting them) and database rights (in European law). The term \"industrial property\" is sometimes used to refer to a large subset of intellectual property rights including patents, trademarks, industrial designs, utility models, service marks, trade names, and geographical indications.\n\nA patent is a form of right granted by the government to an inventor or their successor-in-title, giving the owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, and importing an invention for a limited period of time, in exchange for the public disclosure of the invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem, which may be a product or a process and generally has to fulfill three main requirements: it has to be new, not obvious and there needs to be an industrial applicability. To enrich the body of knowledge and stimulate innovation, it is an obligation for patent owners to disclose valuable information about their inventions to the public.\n\nA copyright gives the creator of an original work exclusive rights to it, usually for a limited time. Copyright may apply to a wide range of creative, intellectual, or artistic forms, or \"works\". Copyright does not cover ideas and information themselves, only the form or manner in which they are expressed.\n\nAn industrial design right (sometimes called \"design right\" or \"design patent\") protects the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian. An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Generally speaking, it is what makes a product look appealing, and as such, it increases the commercial value of goods.\n\nPlant breeders' rights or plant variety rights are the rights to commercially use a new variety of a plant. The variety must amongst others be novel and distinct and for registration the evaluation of propagating material of the variety is considered.\n\nA trademark is a recognizable sign, design or expression which distinguishes products or services of a particular trader from the similar products or services of other traders.\n\nTrade dress is a legal term of art that generally refers to characteristics of the visual and aesthetic appearance of a product or its packaging (or even the design of a building) that signify the source of the product to consumers.\n\nA trade secret is a formula, practice, process, design, instrument, pattern, or compilation of information which is not generally known or reasonably ascertainable, by which a business can obtain an economic advantage over competitors and customers. There is no formal government protection granted; each business must take measures to guard its own trade secrets (e.g., Formula of its soft drinks is a trade secret for Coca-Cola.)\n\nThe main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods for consumers. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. Because they can then profit from them, this gives economic incentive for their creation. The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is indivisible – an unlimited number of people can \"consume\" an intellectual good without it being depleted. Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation – while a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of information and intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent their wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.\n\nBy exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works, society and the patentee/copyright owner mutually benefit, and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work. Some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be \"absolute protection\". \"If some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation, they reason, more is better. The thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions\". This absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of \"real\" property, typically adopting its law and rhetoric. Other recent developments in intellectual property law, such as the America Invents Act, stress international harmonization. Recently there has also been much debate over the desirability of using intellectual property rights to protect cultural heritage, including intangible ones, as well as over risks of commodification derived from this possibility. The issue still remains open in legal scholarship.\n\nThese exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs. In the United States Article I Section 8 Clause 8 of the Constitution, commonly called the Patent and Copyright Clause, reads; \"[The Congress shall have power] 'To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'\" ”Some commentators, such as David Levine and Michele Boldrin, dispute this justification.\n\nIn 2013 the United States Patent & Trademark Office approximated that the worth of intellectual property to the U.S. economy is more than US $5 trillion and creates employment for an estimated 18 million American people. The value of intellectual property is considered similarly high in other developed nations, such as those in the European Union. In the UK, IP has become a recognised asset class for use in pension-led funding and other types of business finance. However, in 2013, the UK Intellectual Property Office stated: \"There are millions of intangible business assets whose value is either not being leveraged at all, or only being leveraged inadvertently\".\n\nThe WIPO treaty and several related international agreements underline that the protection of intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining economic growth. The \"WIPO Intellectual Property Handbook\" gives two reasons for intellectual property laws:\nOne is to give statutory expression to the moral and economic rights of creators in their creations and the rights of the public in access to those creations. The second is to promote, as a deliberate act of Government policy, creativity and the dissemination and application of its results and to encourage fair trading which would contribute to economic and social development.\n\nThe Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) states that \"effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries and globally\".\n\nEconomists estimate that two-thirds of the value of large businesses in the United States can be traced to intangible assets. \"IP-intensive industries\" are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added (price minus material cost) per employee than \"non-IP-intensive industries\".\n\nA joint research project of the WIPO and the United Nations University measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries found \"a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth.\"\n\nAccording to Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \"everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author\". Although the relationship between intellectual property and human rights is a complex one, there are moral arguments for intellectual property.\n\nThe arguments that justify intellectual property fall into three major categories. Personality theorists believe intellectual property is an extension of an individual. Utilitarians believe that intellectual property stimulates social progress and pushes people to further innovation. Lockeans argue that intellectual property is justified based on deservedness and hard work.\n\nVarious moral justifications for private property can be used to argue in favor of the morality of intellectual property, such as:\n\n\nLysander Spooner (1855) argues \"that a man has a natural and absolute right—and if a natural and absolute, then necessarily a perpetual, right—of property, in the ideas, of which he is the discoverer or creator; that his right of property, in ideas, is intrinsically the same as, and stands on identically the same grounds with, his right of property in material things; that no distinction, of principle, exists between the two cases\".\n\nWriter Ayn Rand argued in her book \"\" that the protection of intellectual property is essentially a moral issue. The belief is that the human mind itself is the source of wealth and survival and that all property at its base is intellectual property. To violate intellectual property is therefore no different morally than violating other property rights which compromises the very processes of survival and therefore constitutes an immoral act.\n\nViolation of intellectual property rights, called \"infringement\" with respect to patents, copyright, and trademarks, and \"misappropriation\" with respect to trade secrets, may be a breach of civil law or criminal law, depending on the type of intellectual property involved, jurisdiction, and the nature of the action.\n\nAs of 2011 trade in counterfeit copyrighted and trademarked works was a $600 billion industry worldwide and accounted for 5–7% of global trade.\n\nPatent infringement typically is caused by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent. There is safe harbor in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research. This safe harbor does not exist in the US unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes, or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug. In general, patent infringement cases are handled under civil law (e.g., in the United States) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also (for example, Argentina, China, France, Japan, Russia, South Korea).\n\nCopyright infringement is reproducing, distributing, displaying or performing a work, or to make derivative works, without permission from the copyright holder, which is typically a publisher or other business representing or assigned by the work's creator. It is often called \"piracy\". While copyright is created the instant a work is fixed, generally the copyright holder can only get money damages if the owner registers the copyright. Enforcement of copyright is generally the responsibility of the copyright holder. The ACTA trade agreement, signed in May 2011 by the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the EU, and which has not entered into force, requires that its parties add criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for copyright and trademark infringement, and obligated the parties to active police for infringement. There are limitations and exceptions to copyright, allowing limited use of copyrighted works, which does not constitute infringement. Examples of such doctrines are the fair use and fair dealing doctrine.\n\nTrademark infringement occurs when one party uses a trademark that is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark owned by another party, in relation to products or services which are identical or similar to the products or services of the other party. In many countries, a trademark receives protection without registration, but registering a trademark provides legal advantages for enforcement. Infringement can be addressed by civil litigation and, in several jurisdictions, under criminal law.\n\nTrade secret misappropriation is different from violations of other intellectual property laws, since by definition trade secrets are secret, while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available. In the United States, trade secrets are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The United States also has federal law in the form of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, , criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, , criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as in the United States.\n\nCriticism of the term \"intellectual property\" ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like \"property\" and \"rights\" in fashions that contradict practice and law. Many detractors think this term specially serves the doctrinal agenda of parties opposing reform in the public interest or otherwise abusing related legislations; and that it disallows intelligent discussion about specific and often unrelated aspects of copyright, patents, trademarks, etc.\n\nFree Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman argues that, although the term \"intellectual property\" is in wide use, it should be rejected altogether, because it \"systematically distorts and confuses these issues, and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion\". He claims that the term \"operates as a catch-all to lump together disparate laws [which] originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues\" and that it creates a \"bias\" by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things, likening them to \"property rights\". Stallman advocates referring to copyrights, patents and trademarks in the singular and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term. He argues that \"to avoid spreading unnecessary bias and confusion, it is best to adopt a firm policy not to speak or even think in terms of 'intellectual property'.\"\n\nSimilarly, economists Boldrin and Levine prefer to use the term \"intellectual monopoly\" as a more appropriate and clear definition of the concept, which they argue, is very dissimilar from property rights. They further argued that “stronger patents do little or nothing to encourage innovation”, mainly explained by its tendency to create market monopolies, thereby restricting further innovations and technology transfer.\n\nOn the assumption that intellectual property rights are actual rights, Stallman says that this claim does not live to the historical intentions behind these laws, which in the case of copyright served as a censorship system, and later on, a regulatory model for the printing press that may have benefited authors incidentally, but never interfered with the freedom of average readers. Still referring to copyright, he cites legal literature such as the United States Constitution and case law to demonstrate that the law is meant to be an optional and experimental bargain to temporarily trade property rights and free speech for public, not private, benefits in the form of increased artistic production and knowledge. He mentions that \"if copyright were a natural right nothing could justify terminating this right after a certain period of time\".\n\nLaw professor, writer and political activist Lawrence Lessig, along with many other copyleft and free software activists, has criticized the implied analogy with physical property (like land or an automobile). They argue such an analogy fails because physical property is generally rivalrous while intellectual works are non-rivalrous (that is, if one makes a copy of a work, the enjoyment of the copy does not prevent enjoyment of the original). Other arguments along these lines claim that unlike the situation with tangible property, there is no natural scarcity of a particular idea or information: once it exists at all, it can be re-used and duplicated indefinitely without such re-use diminishing the original. Stephan Kinsella has objected to \"intellectual property\" on the grounds that the word \"property\" implies scarcity, which may not be applicable to ideas.\n\nEntrepreneur and politician Rickard Falkvinge and hacker Alexandre Oliva have independently compared George Orwell's fictional dialect Newspeak to the terminology used by intellectual property supporters as a linguistic weapon to shape public opinion regarding copyright debate and DRM.\n\nIn civil law jurisdictions, intellectual property has often been referred to as intellectual rights, traditionally a somewhat broader concept that has included moral rights and other personal protections that cannot be bought or sold. Use of the term \"intellectual rights\" has declined since the early 1980s, as use of the term \"intellectual property\" has increased.\n\nAlternative terms \"monopolies on information\" and \"intellectual monopoly\" have emerged among those who argue against the \"property\" or \"intellect\" or \"rights\" assumptions, notably Richard Stallman. The backronyms \"intellectual protectionism\" and \"intellectual poverty\", whose initials are also \"IP\", have found supporters as well, especially among those who have used the backronym \"digital restrictions management\".\n\nThe argument that an intellectual property right should (in the interests of better balancing of relevant private and public interests) be termed an \"intellectual monopoly privilege\" (IMP) has been advanced by several academics including Birgitte Andersen and Thomas Alured Faunce.\n\nSome critics of intellectual property, such as those in the free culture movement, point at intellectual monopolies as harming health (in the case of pharmaceutical patents), preventing progress, and benefiting concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses, and argue that the public interest is harmed by ever-expansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions, software patents, and business method patents. More recently scientists and engineers are expressing concern that patent thickets are undermining technological development even in high-tech fields like nanotechnology.\n\nPetra Moser has asserted that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may harm innovation:\nOverall, the weight of the existing historical evidence suggests that patent policies, which grant strong intellectual property rights to early generations of inventors, may discourage innovation. On the contrary, policies that encourage the diffusion of ideas and modify patent laws to facilitate entry and encourage competition may be an effective mechanism to encourage innovation.\n\nIn support of that argument, Jörg Baten, Nicola Bianchi and Petra Moser find historical evidence that especially compulsory licensing – which allows governments to license patents without the consent of patent-owners – encouraged invention in Germany in the early 20th century by increasing the threat of competition in fields with low pre-existing levels of competition.\n\nPeter Drahos notes, \"Property rights confer authority over resources. When authority is granted to the few over resources on which many depend, the few gain power over the goals of the many. This has consequences for both political and economic freedoms with in a society.\"\n\nThe World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) recognizes that conflicts may exist between the respect for and implementation of current intellectual property systems and other human rights. In 2001 the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued a document called \"Human rights and intellectual property\" that argued that intellectual property tends to be governed by economic goals when it should be viewed primarily as a social product; in order to serve human well-being, intellectual property systems must respect and conform to human rights laws. According to the Committee, when systems fail to do so they risk infringing upon the human right to food and health, and to cultural participation and scientific benefits. In 2004 the General Assembly of WIPO adopted \"The Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization\" which argues that WIPO should \"focus more on the needs of developing countries, and to view IP as one of many tools for development—not as an end in itself\".\n\nFurther along these lines, The ethical problems brought up by IP rights are most pertinent when it is socially valuable goods like life-saving medicines are given IP protection. While the application of IP rights can allow companies to charge higher than the marginal cost of production in order to recoup the costs of research and development, the price may exclude from the market anyone who cannot afford the cost of the product, in this case a life-saving drug. \"An IPR driven regime is therefore not a regime that is conductive to the investment of R&D of products that are socially valuable to predominately poor populations\".\n\nLibertarians have differing views on intellectual property. Stephan Kinsella, an anarcho-capitalist on the right-wing of libertarianism, argues against intellectual property because allowing property rights in ideas and information creates artificial scarcity and infringes on the right to own tangible property. Kinsella uses the following scenario to argue this point:\n[I]magine the time when men lived in caves. One bright guy—let's call him Galt-Magnon—decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be sure, this is a good idea, and others notice it. They naturally imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But the first man to invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule flies in the face of the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights.\n\nThomas Jefferson once said in a letter to Isaac McPherson on August 13, 1813:\n\"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.\"\n\nIn 2005 the RSA launched the Adelphi Charter, aimed at creating an international policy statement to frame how governments should make balanced intellectual property law.\n\nAnother aspect of current U.S. Intellectual Property legislation is its focus on individual and joint works; thus, copyright protection can only be obtained in 'original' works of authorship.\n\nOther criticism of intellectual property law concerns the expansion of intellectual property, both in duration and in scope.\n\nIn addition, as scientific knowledge has expanded and allowed new industries to arise in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, originators of technology have sought IP protection for the new technologies. Patents have been granted for living organisms, (and in the United States, certain living organisms have been patentable for over a century).\n\nThe increase in terms of protection is particularly seen in relation to copyright, which has recently been the subject of serial extensions in the United States and in Europe. With no need for registration or copyright notices, this is thought to have led to an increase in orphan works (copyrighted works for which the copyright owner cannot be contacted), a problem that has been noticed and addressed by governmental bodies around the world.\n\nAlso with respect to copyright, the American film industry helped to change the social construct of intellectual property via its trade organization, the Motion Picture Association of America. In amicus briefs in important cases, in lobbying before Congress, and in its statements to the public, the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights. In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor. Additionally Congress's awareness of the position of the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property. These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry, lending the MPAA even more power and authority.\nThe growth of the Internet, and particularly distributed search engines like Kazaa and Gnutella, have represented a challenge for copyright policy. The Recording Industry Association of America, in particular, has been on the front lines of the fight against copyright infringement, which the industry calls \"piracy\". The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company Napster, and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based digital rights management tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act have been enacted that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the Copyright Directive. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the Conditional Access Directive of 1998 (98/84/EEC). This can hinder legal uses, affecting public domain works, limitations and exceptions to copyright, or uses allowed by the copyright holder. Some copyleft licenses, like GNU GPL 3, are designed to counter that. Laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventor's program, or for accessibility reasons; however, distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal.\n\nIn the context of trademarks, this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of \"trademark\", as exemplified by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ratified in 1994, which formalized regulations for IP rights that had been handled by common law, or not at all, in member states. Pursuant to TRIPs, any sign which is \"capable of distinguishing\" the products or services of one business from the products or services of another business is capable of constituting a trademark.\n\nIntellectual property has become a core tool in corporate tax planning and tax avoidance. IP is a key component of the leading multinational tax avoidance base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) tools, which the OECD estimates costs $100-240 billion in lost annual tax revenues, and includes:\nIn 2017-2018, both the U.S. and the EU Commission simultaneously decided to depart from the OECD BEPS Project timetable, which was set up in 2013 to combat IP BEPS tax tools like the above, and launch their own anti-IP BEPS tax regimes:\n\nThe departure of the U.S. and EU Commission from the OECD BEPS Project process, is attributed to frustrations with the rise in IP as a key BEPS tax tool, creating intangible assets, which are then turned into royalty payment BEPS schemes (double Irish), and/or capital allowance BEPS schemes (capital allowances for intangibles). In contrast, the OECD has spent years developing and advocating intellectual property as a legal and a GAAP accounting concept.\n\nThe EU Commission's €13 billion fine of Apple's pre 2015 double Irish IP BEPS tax scheme, is the largest corporate tax fine in history.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "864759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=864759", "title": "Irish folklore", "text": "Irish folklore\n\nDue to its complexity folklore does not have a single definition. However, it can be considered as \"the traditional art, literature, knowledge, and practices that are disseminated largely through oral communication and behavioural example\". It can also include traditions, beliefs, worldviews, knowledge and skills (how to build a house, how to treat an illness), and talents (story-telling, songs, plays). All in all, folklore is an important part of group and national identity. As it can be studied as an understanding of how people live, giving an insight into people's daily life, it can have an academic value.\n\nIrish folklore, when mentioned to many people, conjures up images of banshees, fairy stories, leprechauns and people gathering around, sharing stories of a man as strong as 300 men put together. Many tales and legends were passed from generations to generations, so were the way to celebrate important moments such as marriages, deaths, birthday and holidays (Christmas, Halloween (\"Oíche Shamhna\"), St. Patrick's Day) or the way we hand down skills such as making weaved baskets or St. Bridget's crosses. All of the above can be considered as a part of folklore, as it is the study and appreciation of how people lived.\n\nIrish folklore consists of many classics that are repeated to this day. Popular Irish folkltales include the Otherworld (\"An Saol Eile)\", which revolves around the idea of supernatural manifestations and beings. These beings appear in many of the folkloristic genres such as ballads, popular song, legends, memorates, belief statements and folkloric material. Some famous examples from this include the Irish fairylore and restless souls and spirits around Halloween such as the Banshee.\n\nThe Banshee is one of the most popular classics to this day, known by many different names (for example, \"Badh\" commonly used in the south of Ireland). The Banshee is also rumoured to have a connection with certain families, and is said to follow the prominent male members of the family. Popular opinion is also that she is seen as the ancestress of Irish families and is deeply concerned with the families fortunes. It is uncertain whether the Banshee is evil or good.\n\nOther classics include leprechauns, fairies, rainbows, Cu Chluain, Children of Lir, Dullahan (headless horsemen), Pookas, Changelings.\n\nThe word folklore in French means “picturesque but without importance or without deep significance”. In Ireland the word Folk Lore has deep meaning to its people and brings societies together, it is a word that has ideological significance in this country. In Ireland, folklore can be associated with the countryside, specifically the Irish speaking West, Aran Islands, oral stories, the fiddle, intimate settings. Folklore is also massively tied with traditional Irish music and dance for example the river dance can be tied to folklore in ways.\n\nSamhain and Beltane are two traditions that are rooted in folklore, and are still in practice today. \n\nSamhain, (Celtic for “End of Summer\") is an ancient Celtic tradition. It marks the end of the lighter half of the world (summer), and the beginning of the darker half (winter). It is here where it was believed that the division between life and the after life was thinnest. It was believed that this thinning allowed spirts to move between this world and the other. The widely practice holiday of Halloween originates from Samhain. \n\nAnother tradition rooted in folklore is Beltane. Beltane is held on the first day of May. This tradition is a celebration marking the beginning of summer. During this tradition rituals were performed to protect both crops and livestock. Large bonfires were lit serving as protection for grazing cattle. Today Beltane festivals can be found in both Ireland and Scotland.\n\nFairy lore is a body of stories, anecdotes, beliefs and the likes of these that are relating to fairies. It usually contains superstitions and stories that were passed down throughout the generations.\n\nThere are different famous superstitions involving fairy lore. These superstitions mention that fairy forts and hawthorn trees, also known as fairy trees, are the places of residency of fairies. To tamper with these sites is seen as hugely disrespectful to the fairies. When tampered with, it could be seen an act of provocation towards these supernatural beings which would result in unexplainable consequences such as sickness, bad luck or even death. These encounters are recorded in Irish fairy tales as well as passed down by word of mouth. The effects of these stories and superstitions are evident, even up to the present day, where even government infrastructure are planned in a way that preserves these sites.\n\nFairy stories include \"The Field of Boliauns\", \"The Children Of Lir\", \"Finn MacCool\", \"The Fairy Well of Lagnanay\" and many others.\n\nThere are different types of fairies in Irish fairy lore with different abilities and characteristics. These include the famous few such as the leprechaun, banshees, changelings and many others. The origin of these Irish fairies could be dated back to the ancient Celtic beliefs of pagan Gods and supernatural beings. However, there is no linear path that traces the development of fairy lore in Ireland from its origin.\n\nIrish fairy lore has influenced many English authors, such as Jonathan Swift, who wrote Gulliver's Travels while living in Ireland.\n\nÓ Súilleabháin was part of the Irish Folklore Commission, \"Béaloideas\". Not long after the foundation of the commission he created two books for the collectors. The first, in 1937, a shorter volume in the Irish Language, \"Láimh-Leabhar Béaloideasa\", mainly used by collectors in the Irish speaking areas. In 1942 he wrote his more well-known volume \"A Handbook of Irish Folklore\" (published 1947). To this day his work serves as a great resource to collectors of Irish folklore and provides a wide outline of the traditions of Irish Folklore. He also wrote a booklet of topics, in both Irish and English, in 1937 to be used by teachers and school children in primary schools in the South of Ireland as part of the Schools' Scheme for the collection of folklore (1937-1938). He focused on the native Gaelic tradition and the tradition of story-tellying. He played particular attention to the stories of Fionn Mac Cumhail and the Fianna, and looked into how stories were told in Irish and in other languages across Europe. His work was and still is very important in the study of Irish Folklore for the masses.\n\nWhen Christianity was first brought in Ireland during the 5th century by missionaries, they were not able to totally wipe out the pre-existing folklore and beliefs in God-like fairies. But folklore didn’t remain untouched, and the myths and Christian beliefs were combined such that Irish folklore would “enforce Christian ideals but still remain as a concession to early fairy belief systems”. Christianity altered the importance of some beliefs and define a new place for them in folklore. For example, fairies, who were previously perceived as God, became merely magical, and of much lesser importance. Along with it, a fusion of folklore legends and Christianity was witnessed. One of the major example of this is the existence of legends featuring both Saint Patrick, a central figure in the Irish church, and fairies (for example, “The Colloquy of the Ancients” is a dialogue between Saint Patrick and the ghost of Caeilte of the Fianna, an ancient clan of Celtic warriors).\n\nAll in all, the current Irish folklore shows a strong absorption of Christianity, including its lesson of morality and spiritual beliefs, creating a “singular brand of fairy tale tradition”.\n\nFolklore is a part of national identity, and is evolving through time. During the 16th century, the English conquest overthrew the traditional political and religious autonomy of the country. The Great famine of 1840’s, and the deaths and emigration it brought, weakened a still powerful Gaelic culture, especially within the rural proletariat, which was at the time the most traditional social grouping. At the time, intellectuals such as Sir William Wilde expressed concerns on the decay of traditional beliefs:\n\nMoreover, in the last decades, capitalism has helped overcoming special spatial barriers making it easier for cultures to merge into one another (such as the amalgam between Samhain and Halloween).\n\nAll those events have led to a massive decline of native learned Gaelic traditions and Irish language, and with Irish tradition being mainly an oral tradition, this has led to a loss of identity and historical continuity, in a similar nature to Durkheim's anomie.\n\nHonko describes the current state of the Irish folklore as its “second life”. Even though there is still a natural existence of folklore within its natural community, folklore material is now being used in other environments, such as marketing (with strategies suggesting tradition and authenticity for goods), movies and TV-shows (\"The Secret of Kells\", mention of the Banshee are found in tv-shows such as \"Supernatural\", \"Teen Wolf\" or \"Charmed\"), books (the book series \"The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel,\" the novel \"American Gods\"...), contributing to the creation of a new body of Irish folklore.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His mother, Joan Hart, is the granddaughter of Charles Edenshaw. His father was European, allowing Hart to escape the Canadian Indian residential school system that many Haida of his time were sent to. Instead, he grew up with his grandparents and became a fisherman.\n\nHart discovered his passion for Haida art in high school. He began carving seriously in 1979. Hart first apprenticed with Robert Davidson in 1978 to help construct a set of totem poles. From 1980 to 1984 he became an assistant to Bill Reid in Vancouver, who by then was too seriously afflicted with Parkinson's disease to do much of his own carving. He began his work with Reid by putting the finishing details on \"The Raven and the First Man\", a centerpiece of the Museum of Anthropology at UBC, and he also assisted on Reid's \"Spirit of Haida Gwaii / The Jade Canoe\".\n\nHart lives in both Vancouver and Haida Gwaii. In Haida Gwaii, he is known as ˀIdansuu, a hereditary chief name that he received in 1999 after it had earlier been held by Charles Edenshaw. As chief he belongs to the Hereditary Chiefs Council of the Haida Nation.\n\nHart was the first Northwest Coast artist to use bronze, beginning in 1982, and he has also made works in silver and gold. In 1988, he supervised the construction of the Haida house in the Canadian Museum of Civilization.\n\nA 1995 wood sculpture that Hart considers to be his equivalent of a doctoral thesis, \"Frog Constellation\", depicts two people on the back of a giant frog; it was installed in 2012 on the campus of Simon Fraser University. \"The Dance Screen\", a large wood carving that he began designing in 2009, was installed in 2012 as a temporary exhibit in the Vancouver Art Gallery.

Particularly noted for his study of cities and urban architecture, he had a broad career as a writer. Mumford was influenced by the work of Scottish theorist Sir Patrick Geddes and worked closely with his associate the British sociologist Victor Branford.\n\nMumford was also a contemporary and friend of Frank Lloyd Wright, Clarence Stein, Frederic Osborn, Edmund N. Bacon, and Vannevar Bush.\n\nMumford was born in Flushing, Queens, New York and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1912. He studied at the City College of New York and The New School for Social Research, but became ill with tuberculosis and never finished his degree. In 1918 he joined the navy to serve in World War I and was assigned as a radio electrician. He was discharged in 1919 and became associate editor of \"The Dial\", an influential modernist literary journal. He later worked for \"The New Yorker\" where he wrote architectural criticism and commentary on urban issues.\n\nMumford's earliest books in the field of literary criticism have had a lasting impact on contemporary American literary criticism. \"The Golden Day\" contributed to a resurgence in scholarly research on the work of 1850s American transcendentalist authors and \"Herman Melville: A Study of His Life and Vision\" effectively launched a revival in the study of the work of Herman Melville. Soon after, with the book \"The Brown Decades\", he began to establish himself as an authority in American architecture and urban life, which he interpreted in a social context.\n\nIn his early writings on urban life, Mumford was optimistic about human abilities and wrote that the human race would use electricity and mass communication to build a better world for all humankind. He would later take a more pessimistic stance. His early architectural criticism also helped to bring wider public recognition to the work of Henry Hobson Richardson, Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nIn 1963, Mumford received the Frank Jewett Mather Award for art criticism from the College Art Association. Mumford received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964. In 1975 Mumford was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). In 1976, he was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca. In 1986, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts.\n\nHe served as the architectural critic for \"The New Yorker\" magazine for over 30 years. His 1961 book, \"The City in History\", received the National Book Award.\n\nLewis Mumford died at the age of 94 at his home in Amenia, New York on January 26, 1990. Nine years later it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. His wife Sophia died in 1997, at age 97.\n\nIn his book \"The Condition of Man\", published in 1944, Mumford characterized his orientation toward the study of humanity as \"organic humanism\". The term is an important one because it sets limits on human possibilities, limits that are aligned with the nature of the human body. Mumford never forgot the importance of air quality, of food availability, of the quality of water, or the comfort of spaces, because all these things had to be respected if people were to thrive. Technology and progress could never become a runaway train in his reasoning, so long as organic humanism was there to act as a brake. Indeed, Mumford considered the human brain from this perspective, characterizing it as hyperactive, a good thing in that it allowed humanity to conquer many of nature's threats, but potentially a bad thing if it were not occupied in ways that stimulated it meaningfully. Mumford's respect for human \"nature\", that is to say, the natural characteristics of being human, provided him with a platform from which to assess technologies, and technics in general. Thus his criticism and counsel with respect to the city and with respect to the implementation of technology was fundamentally organized around the organic humanism to which he ascribed. It was from the perspective of organic humanism that Mumford eventually launched a critical assessment of Marshall McLuhan, who argued that the technology, not the natural environment, would ultimately shape the nature of humankind, a possibility that Mumford recognized, but only as a nightmare scenario.\n\nMumford believed that what defined humanity, what set human beings apart from other animals, was not primarily our use of tools (technology) but our use of language (symbols). He was convinced that the sharing of information and ideas amongst participants of primitive societies was completely natural to early humanity, and had obviously been the foundation of society as it became more sophisticated and complex. He had hopes for a continuation of this process of information \"pooling\" in the world as humanity moved into the future.\n\nMumford's choice of the word \"technics\" throughout his work was deliberate. For Mumford, technology is one part of technics. Using the broader definition of the Greek \"tekhne\", which means not only technology but also art, skill, and dexterity, technics refers to the interplay of social milieu and technological innovation—the \"wishes, habits, ideas, goals\" as well as \"industrial processes\" of a society. As Mumford writes at the beginning of \"Technics and Civilization\", \"other civilizations reached a high degree of technical proficiency without, apparently, being profoundly influenced by the methods and aims of technics.\"\n\nIn \"The Myth of the Machine Vol II: The Pentagon of Power\" (Chapter 12) (1970), Mumford criticizes the modern trend of technology, which emphasizes constant, unrestricted expansion, production, and replacement. He contends that these goals work against technical perfection, durability, social efficiency, and overall human satisfaction. Modern technology, which he called \"megatechnics\", fails to produce lasting, quality products by using devices such as consumer credit, installment buying, non-functioning and defective designs, planned obsolescence, and frequent superficial \"fashion\" changes. \"Without constant enticement by advertising,\" he writes, \"production would slow down and level off to normal replacement demand. Otherwise many products could reach a plateau of efficient design which would call for only minimal changes from year to year.\"\n\nHe uses his own refrigerator as an example, reporting that it \"has been in service for nineteen years, with only a single minor repair: an admirable job. Both automatic refrigerators for daily use and deepfreeze preservation are inventions of permanent value. ... [O]ne can hardly doubt that if biotechnic criteria were heeded, rather than those of market analysts and fashion experts, an equally good product might come forth from Detroit, with an equally long prospect of continued use.\"\n\nMumford was deeply concerned with the relationship between technics and bioviability. The latter term, not used by Mumford, characterizes an area's capability to support life up through its levels of complexity. Before the advent of technology, most areas of the planet were bioviable at some level or other; however, where certain forms of technology advance rapidly, bioviability decreases dramatically. Slag heaps, poisoned waters, parking lots, and concrete cities, for example, are extremely limited in terms of their bioviability, illustrated in the somewhat startling 1943 novel title \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\", and non-bioviable regions are common to cinema in the form of dystopias (e.g., \"Bladerunner\"). Mumford did not believe it was necessary for bioviability to collapse as technics advanced, however, because he held it was possible to create technologies that functioned in an ecologically responsible manner, and he called that sort of technology biotechnics. Mumford believed that biotechnic consciousness (and possibly even community) was emerging as a later stage in the evolution of Darwinian thinking about the nature of human life. He believed this was the sort of technics needed to shake off the suicidal drive of \"megatechnics.\" While Mumford recognized an ecological consciousness that traces back to the earliest communities, he regarded emerging biotechnics as a product of neo-Darwinian consciousness, as a post-industrial form of thinking, one that refuses to look away from the mutually-influencing relationship between the state of the living organism and the state of its environment. In Mumford's mind, the society organized around biotechnics would restrain its technology for the sake of that integral relationship.\n\nIn Mumford's understanding, the various technologies that arose in the megatechnic context have brought unintended and harmful side effects along with the obvious benefits they have bequeathed to us. He points out, for example, that the development of money (as a technology) created, as a side effect, a context for irrational accumulation of excess because it eliminated the burdensome aspects of object-wealth by making wealth abstract. In those eras when wealth was not abstract, plenitude had functioned as the organizing principle around its acquisition (i.e., wealth, measured in grains, lands, animals, to the point that one is satisfied, but not saddled with it). Money, which allows wealth to be conceived as pure quantity instead of quality, is an example of megatechnics, one which can spiral out of control. If Mumford is right in this conceptualization, historians and economists should be able to trace a relationship between the still-increasing abstraction of wealth and radical transformations with respect to wealth's distribution and role. And, indeed, it does appear that, alongside its many benefits, the movement toward electronic money has stimulated forms of economic stress and exploitation not yet fully understood and not yet come to their conclusion. A technology for distributing resources that was less given to abstract hoarding would be more suitable to a biotechnic conception of living.\n\nThus Mumford argued that the biotechnic society would not hold to the megatechnic delusion that technology must expand unceasingly, magnifying its own power and would shatter that delusion in order to create and preserve \"livability.\" Rather than the megatechnic pursuit of power, the biotechnic society would pursue what Mumford calls \"plenitude\"; that is, a homeostatic relationship between resources and needs. This notion of plenitude becomes clearer if we suggest that the biotechnic society would relate to its technology in the manner an animal relates to available food–under circumstances of natural satisfaction, the pursuit of technological advance would not simply continue \"for its own sake.\"\n\nAlongside the limiting effect of satisfaction amidst plenitude, the pursuit of technological advance would also be limited by its potentially negative effects upon the organism. Thus, in a biotechnic society, the quality of air, the quality of food, the quality of water, these would all be significant concerns that could limit any technological ambitions threatening to them. The anticipated negative value of noise, radiation, smog, noxious chemicals, and other technical by-products would significantly constrain the introduction of new technical innovation. In Mumford's words, a biotechnic society would direct itself toward \"qualitative richness, amplitude, spaciousness, and freedom from quantitative pressures and crowding. Self-regulation, self-correction, and self-propulsion are as much an integral property of organisms as nutrition, reproduction, growth, and repair.\" The biotechnic society would pursue balance, wholeness, and completeness; and this is what those individuals in pursuit of biotechnics would do as well.\n\nMumford's critique of the city and his vision of cities that are organized around the nature of human bodies, so essential to all Mumford's work on city life and urban design, is rooted in an incipient notion of biotechnics: \"livability,\" a notion which Mumford got from his mentor, Patrick Geddes.\n\nMumford used the term biotechnics in the later sections of \"The Pentagon of Power\", written in 1970. The term sits well alongside his early characterization of \"organic humanism,\" in that biotechnics represent the concrete form of technique that appeals to an organic humanist. When Mumford described biotechnics, automotive and industrial pollution had become dominant technological concerns, along with the fear of nuclear annihilation. Mumford recognized, however, that technology had even earlier produced a plethora of hazards, and that it would do so into the future. For Mumford, human hazards are rooted in a power-oriented technology that does not adequately respect and accommodate the essential nature of humanity. Mumford is stating implicitly, as others would later state explicitly, that contemporary human life understood in its ecological sense is out of balance because the technical parts of its ecology (guns, bombs, cars, drugs) have spiraled out of control, driven by forces peculiar to them rather than constrained by the needs of the species that created them. He believed that biotechnics was the emerging answer and the only hope that could be set out against the problem of megatechnics. It was an answer, he believed, that was already beginning to assert itself in his time.\n\nIt is true that Mumford's writing privileges the term \"biotechnics\" more than the \"biotechnic society.\" The reason is clear in the last sentence of \"The Pentagon of Power\" where he writes, \"for those of us who have thrown off the myth of the machine, the next move is ours: for the gates of the technocratic prison will open automatically, despite their rusty ancient hinges, as soon as we choose to walk out.\" Mumford believed that the biotechnic society was a desideratum—one that should guide his contemporaries as they walked out the doors of their megatechnic confines (he also calls them \"coffins\"). Thus he ends his narrative, as he well understood, at the beginning of another one: the possible revolution that gives rise to a biotechnic society, a quiet revolution, for Mumford, one that would arise from the biotechnic consciousness and actions of individuals. Mumford was an avid reader of Alfred North Whitehead's philosophy of the organism.\n\nA key idea, introduced in \"Technics and Civilization\" (1934) was that technology was twofold:\n\nMumford commonly criticized modern America's transportation networks as being \"monotechnic\" in their reliance on cars. Automobiles become obstacles for other modes of transportation, such as walking, bicycle and public transit, because the roads they use consume so much space and are such a danger to people. Mumford explains that the thousands of maimed and dead each year as a result of automobile accidents are a \"ritual sacrifice\" the American society makes because of its extreme reliance on highway transport.\n\nAlso discussed at length in \"Technics and Civilization\" is Mumford's division of human civilization into three distinct epochs (following concepts originated by Patrick Geddes):\n\nMumford also refers to large hierarchical organizations as \"megamachines\"—a machine using humans as its components. These organizations characterize Mumford's stage theory of civilization. The most recent megamachine manifests itself, according to Mumford, in modern technocratic nuclear powers—Mumford used the examples of the Soviet and United States power complexes represented by the Kremlin and the Pentagon, respectively. The builders of the pyramids, the Roman Empire and the armies of the World Wars are prior examples.\n\nHe explains that meticulous attention to accounting and standardization, and elevation of military leaders to divine status, are spontaneous features of megamachines throughout history. He cites such examples as the repetitive nature of Egyptian paintings which feature enlarged pharaohs and public display of enlarged portraits of Communist leaders such as Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin. He also cites the overwhelming prevalence of quantitative accounting records among surviving historical fragments, from ancient Egypt to Nazi Germany.\n\nNecessary to the construction of these megamachines is an enormous bureaucracy of humans which act as \"servo-units\", working without ethical involvement. According to Mumford, technological improvements such as the assembly line, or instant, global, wireless, communication and remote control, can easily weaken the perennial psychological barriers to certain types of questionable actions. An example which he uses is that of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi official who organized logistics in support of the Holocaust. Mumford collectively refers to people willing to carry out placidly the extreme goals of these megamachines as \"Eichmanns\".\n\nOne of the better-known studies of Mumford is of the way the mechanical clock was developed by monks in the Middle Ages and subsequently adopted by the rest of society. He viewed this device as the key invention of the whole Industrial Revolution, contrary to the common view of the steam engine holding the prime position, writing: \"The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern industrial age. ... The clock ... is a piece of power-machinery whose 'product' is seconds and minutes ...\"\n\n\"The City in History\" won the 1962 U.S. National Book Award for Nonfiction. In this influential book Mumford explored the development of urban civilizations. Harshly critical of urban sprawl, Mumford argues that the structure of modern cities is partially responsible for many social problems seen in western society. While pessimistic in tone, Mumford argues that urban planning should emphasize an organic relationship between people and their living spaces.\n\nMumford uses the example of the medieval city as the basis for the \"ideal city,\" and claims that the modern city is too close to the Roman city (the sprawling megalopolis) which ended in collapse; if the modern city carries on in the same vein, Mumford argues, then it will meet the same fate as the Roman city.\n\nMumford wrote critically of urban culture believing the city is \"a product of earth ... a fact of nature ... man's method of expression.\" Further, Mumford recognized the crises facing urban culture, distrustful of the growing finance industry, political structures, fearful that a local community culture was not being fostered by these institutions. Mumford feared \"metropolitan finance,\" urbanisation, politics, and alienation. Mumford wrote: \"The physical design of cities and their economic functions are secondary to their relationship to the natural environment and to the spiritual values of human community.\"\n\nSuburbia did not escape Mumford's criticism either:\n\nIn the suburb one might live and die without marring the image of an innocent world, except when some shadow of evil fell over a column in the newspaper. Thus the suburb served as an asylum for the preservation of illusion. Here domesticity could prosper, oblivious of the pervasive regimentation beyond. This was not merely a child-centered environment; it was based on a childish view of the world, in which reality was sacrificed to the pleasure principle.\n\nMumford is also among the first urban planning scholars who paid serious attention to religion in the planning field. In one of his least well-known books, \"Faith for Living\" (1940, p. 216), Mumford argues that:\n\nThe segregation of the spiritual life from the practical life is a curse that falls impartially upon both sides of our existence.\n\nMumford's interest in the history of technology and his explanation of \"polytechnics\", along with his general philosophical bent, has been an important influence on a number of more recent thinkers concerned that technology serve human beings as broadly and well as possible. Some of these authors—such as Jacques Ellul, Witold Rybczynski, Richard Gregg, Amory Lovins, J. Baldwin, E. F. Schumacher, Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Murray Bookchin, Thomas Merton, Marshall McLuhan, and Colin Ward—have been intellectuals and persons directly involved with technological development and decisions about the use of technology.\n\nMumford also had an influence on the American environmental movement, with thinkers like Barry Commoner and Bookchin being influenced by his ideas on cities, ecology and technology. Ramachandra Guha noted his work contains \"some of the earliest and finest thinking on bioregionalism, anti-nuclearism, biodiversity, alternate energy paths, ecological urban planning and appropriate technology.\"\n\nMumford's influence is also evident in the work of some artists including Berenice Abbott's photographs of New York City in the late 1930s.\n\nMumford was an inspiration for Ellsworth Toohey, the antagonist in Ayn Rand's novel \"The Fountainhead\" (1943).\n\nNotes\n\n"}

{"id": "37397201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37397201", "title": "Novelist", "text": "Novelist\n\nA novelist is an author or writer of novels, though often novelists also write in other genres of both fiction and non-fiction. Some novelists are professional novelists, thus make a living writing novels and other fiction, while others aspire to support themselves in this way or write as an avocation. Most novelists struggle to get their debut novel published, but once published they often continue to be published, although very few become literary celebrities, thus gaining prestige or a considerable income from their work.\n\nNovelists come from a variety of backgrounds and social classes, and frequently this shapes the content of their works. Public reception of a novelist's work, the literary criticism commenting on it, and the novelists' incorporation of their own experiences into works and characters can lead to the author's personal life and identity being associated with a novel's fictional content. For this reason, the environment within which a novelist works and the reception of their novels by both the public and publishers can be influenced by their demographics or identity; important among these culturally constructed identities are gender, sexual identity, social class, race or ethnicity, nationality, religion, and an association with place. Similarly, some novelists have creative identities derived from their focus on different genres of fiction, such as crime, romance or historical novels.\n\nWhile many novelists compose fiction to satisfy personal desires, novelists and commentators often ascribe a particular social responsibility or role to novel writers. Many authors use such moral imperatives to justify different approaches to novel writing, including activism or different approaches to representing reality \"truthfully\".\n\nNovelist is a term derivative from the term \"novel\" describing the \"writer of novels\". The Oxford English Dictionary recognizes other definitions of novelist, first appearing in the 16th and 17th centuries to refer to either \"An innovator (in thought or belief); someone who introduces something new or who favours novelty\" or \"An inexperienced person; a novice.\" However, the OED attributes the primary contemporary meaning of \"a writer of novels\" as first appearing in the 1633 book \"\" by C. Farewell citing the passage According to the Google Ngrams, the term novelist first appears in the Google Books database in 1521.\n\nThe difference between professional and amateur novelists often is the author's ability to publish. Many people take up novel writing as a hobby, but the difficulties of completing large scale fictional works of quality prevent the completion of novels. Once authors have completed a novel, they often will try to get it published. The publishing industry requires novels to have accessible profitable markets, thus many novelists will self-publish to circumvent the editorial control of publishers. Self-publishing has long been an option for writers, with vanity presses printing bound books for a fee paid by the writer. In these settings, unlike the more traditional publishing industry, activities usually reserved for a publishing house, like the distribution and promotion of the book, become the author's responsibility. The rise of the Internet and electronic books has made self publishing far less expensive and a realistic way for authors to realize income.\n\nNovelists apply a number of different methods to writing their novels, relying on a variety of approaches to inspire creativity. Some communities actively encourage amateurs to practice writing novels to develop these unique practices, that vary from author to author. For example, the internet-based group, National Novel Writing Month, encourages people to write 50,000-word novels in the month of November, to give novelists practice completing such works. In the 2010 event, over 200,000 people took part – writing a total of over 2.8 billion words.\n\nNovelists don't usually publish their first novels until later in life. However, many novelists begin writing at a young age. For example, Iain Banks (1954-2013) began writing at eleven, and at sixteen completed his first novel, \"The Hungarian Lift-Jet\", about international arms dealers, \"in pencil in a larger-than-foolscap log book\". However, he was thirty before he published his first novel, the highly controversial \"The Wasp Factory\" in 1984. The success of this novel enabled Banks to become a full-time novelist. Often an important writers' juvenilia, even if not published, is prized by scholars because it provides insight into an author's biography and approach to writing; for example, the Brontë family's juvenilia that depicts their imaginary world of Gondal, currently in the British Library, has provided important information on their development as writers.\n\nOccasionally, novelists publish as early as their teens. For example, Patrick O'Brian published his first novel, \"\", at the age of 15, which brought him considerable critical attention. Similarly, Barbara Newhall Follett's \"The House Without Windows\", was accepted and published in 1927 when she was 13 by the Knopf publishing house and earned critical acclaim from the \"New York Times\", the \"Saturday Review\", and H. L. Mencken. Occasionally, these works will achieve popular success as well. For example, though Christopher Paolini's \"Eragon\" (published at age 15), was not a great critical success, but its popularity among readers placed it on the \"New York Times\" Children's Books Best Seller list for 121 weeks.\n\nFirst-time novelists of any age often find themselves unable to get works published, because of a number of reasons reflecting the inexperience of the author and the economic realities of publishers. Often authors must find advocates in the publishing industry, usually literary agents, to successfully publish their debut novels. Sometimes new novelists will self-publish, because publishing houses will not risk the capital needed to market books by an unknown author to the public.\n\nResponding to the difficulty of successfully writing and publishing first novels, especially at a young age, there are a number of awards for young and first time novelists to highlight exceptional works from new and/or young authors (for examples see and ).\n\nIn contemporary British and American publishing markets, most authors receive only a small monetary advance before publication of their debut novel; in the rare exceptions when a large print run and high volume of sales are anticipated, the advance can be larger. However, once an author has established themselves in print, some authors can make steady income as long as they remain productive as writers. Additionally, many novelists, even published ones, will take on outside work, such as teaching creative writing in academic institutions, or leave novel writing as a secondary hobby.\n\nFew novelist become literary celebrities or become very wealthy from sale of their novels alone. Often those authors who are wealthy and successful will produce extremely popular genre fiction. Examples include authors like James Patterson, who was the highest paid author in 2010, making 70 million dollars, topping both other novelists and authors of non-fiction. Other famous literary millionaires include popular successes like J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series, Dan Brown author of \"The Da Vinci Code\", historical novelist Bernard Cornwell, and \"Twilight\" author Stephenie Meyer.\n\nThe personal experiences of the novelist will often shape what they write and how readers and critics will interpret their novels. Literary reception has long relied on practices of reading literature through biographical criticism, in which the author's life is presumed to have influence on the topical and thematic concerns of works. Some veins of criticism use this information about the novelist to derive an understanding of the novelist's intentions within his work. However, postmodern literary critics often denounce such an approach; the most notable of these critiques comes from Roland Barthes who argues in his essay \"Death of the Author\" that the author no longer should dictate the reception and meaning derived from their work.\n\nOther, theoretical approaches to literary criticism attempt to explore the author's unintentional influence over their work; methods like psychoanalytic theory or cultural studies, presume that the work produced by a novelist represents fundamental parts of the author's identity. Milan Kundera describes the tensions between the novelist's own identity and the work that the author produces in his essay in \"The New Yorker\" titled \"What is a novelist?\"; he says that the novelist's \"honesty is bound to the vile stake of his megalomania [...]The work is not simply everything a novelist writes-notebooks, diaries, articles. It is the end result of long labor on an aesthetic project[...]The novelist is the sole master of his work. He is his work.\" The close intimacy of identity with the novelist's work ensures that particular elements, whether for class, gender, sexuality, nationality, race, or place-based identity, will influence the reception of their work.\n\nHistorically, because of the amount of leisure time and education required to write novels, most novelists have come from the upper or the educated middle classes. However, working men and women began publishing novels in the twentieth century. This includes in Britain Walter Greenwood's \"Love on the Dole\" (1933), from America B. Traven's, \"The Death Ship\" (1926) and Agnes Smedley, \"Daughter of Earth\" (1929) and from the Soviet Union Nikolay Ostrovsky's \"How the Steel Was Tempered\" (1932). Later, in 1950s Britain, came a group of writers known as the \"Angry young men,\" which included the novelists Alan Sillitoe and Kingsley Amis, who came from the working class and who wrote about working class culture.\n\nSome novelists deliberately write for a working class audience for political ends, profiling \"the working classes and working-class life; perhaps with the intention of making propaganda\". Such literature, sometimes called proletarian literature, maybe associated with the political agendas of the Communist party or left wing sympathizers, and seen as a \"device of revolution\". However, the British tradition of working class literature, unlike the Russian and American, was not especially inspired by the Communist Party, but had its roots in the Chartist movement, and socialism, amongst others.\n\nNovelists are often classified by their national affiliation, suggesting that novels take on a particular character based on the national identity of the authors. In some literature, national identity shapes the self-definition of many novelists. For example, in American literature, many novelists set out to create the \"Great American Novel\", or a novel that defines the American experience in their time. Other novelists engage politically or socially with the identity of other members of their nationality, and thus help define that national identity. For instance, critic Nicola Minott-Ahl describes Victor Hugo's \"Notre-Dame de Paris\" directly helping in the creation of French political and social identity in mid-nineteenth century France.\n\nSome novelists become intimately linked with a particular place or geographic region and therefore receive a place-based identity. In his discussion of the history of the association of particular novelists with place in British literature, critic D. C. D. Pocock, described the sense of place not developing in that canon until a century after the novel form first solidified at the beginning of the 19th century. Often such British regional literature captures the social and local character of a particular region in Britain, focussing on specific features, such as dialect, customs, history, and landscape (also called local colour): \"Such a locale is likely to be rural and/or provincial.\" Thomas Hardy's (1840-1928) novels can be described as regional because of the way he makes use of these elements in relation to a part of the West of England, that he names Wessex. Other British writers that have been characterized as regional novelists, are the Brontë sisters, and writers like Mary Webb (1881-1927), Margiad Evans (1909–58) and Geraint Goodwin (1903–42), who are associate with the Welsh border region. George Eliot (1801–86) on the other hand is particularly associated with the rural English Midlands, whereas Arnold Bennett (1867–1931) is the novelist of the Potteries in Staffordshire, or the \"Five Towns\", (actually six) that now make-up Stoke-on-Trent. Similarly, novelist and poet Walter Scott's (1771-1832) contribution in creating a unified identity for Scotland and were some of the most popular in all of Europe during the subsequent century. Scott's novels were influential in recreating a Scottish identity that the upper-class British society could embrace.\n\nIn American fiction, the concept of American literary regionalism ensures that many genres of novel associated with particular regions often define the reception of the novelists. For example, in writing Western novels, Zane Grey has been described as a \"place-defining novelist\", credited for defining the western frontier in America consciousness at the beginning of the 20th century while becoming linked as an individual to his depiction of that space.\n\nSimilarly, novelist such as Mark Twain, William Faulkner, Eudora Welty, and Flannery O'Connor are often describe as writing within a particular tradition of Southern literature, in which subject matter relevant to the South is associated with their own identities as authors. For example, William Faulkner set many of his short stories and novels in Yoknapatawpha County, which is based on, and nearly geographically identical to, Lafayette County, of which his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi. In addition to the geographical component of Southern literature, certain themes have appeared because of the similar histories of the Southern states in regard to slavery, the American Civil War, and Reconstruction. The conservative culture in the South has also produced a strong focus by novelists from there on the significance of family, religion, community, the use of the Southern dialect, along with a strong sense of place. The South's troubled history with racial issues has also continually concerned its novelists.\n\nIn Latin America a literary movement called Criollismo or costumbrismo was active from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, which is considered equivalent to American literary regionalism. It used a realist style to portray the scenes, language, customs and manners of the country the writer was from, especially the lower and peasant classes, \"criollismo\" led to an original literature based on the continent's natural elements, mostly epic and foundational. It was strongly influenced by the wars of independence from Spain and also denotes how each country in its own way defines \"criollo\", which in Latin America refers to locally-born people of Spanish ancestry.\n\nNovelists often will be assessed in contemporary criticism based on their gender or treatment of gender. Largely, this has to do with the dominance of men in the publishing situation. Literary criticism, especially since the rise of feminist theory, pays attention to how women, historically, have experienced a very different set of writing expectations based on their gender; for example, the editors of \"The Feminist Companion to Literature in English\" point out: \"Their texts emerge from and intervene in conditions usually very different from those which produced most writing by men.\" It is not a question of the subject matter or political stance of a particular author, but of her gender: her position as a woman within the literary marketplace. However, the publishing market's orientation to favor the primary reading audience of women may increasingly skew the market towards female novelists; for this reason, novelist Teddy Wayne argued in a 2012 \"Salon\" article titled \"The agony of the male novelist\" that midlist male novelists are less likely to find success than midlist female novelist, even though men tend to dominate \"literary fiction\" spaces.\n\nThe position of women in the literary marketplace can change public conversation about novelists and their place within popular culture, leading to debates over sexism. For example, in 2013, American female novelist Amanda Filipacchi wrote a New York Times editorial challenging Wikipedia's categorization of American female novelists , which precipitated a significant amount of press coverage describing that Wikipedia's approach to categorization as sexism. For her, the public representation of women novelists within another category marginalizes and defines women novelists like herself outside of a field of \"American novelists\" dominated by men. However, other commentators, discussing the controversy also note that by removing such categories as \"Women novelist\" or \"Lesbian writer\" from the description of gendered or sexual minorities, the discover-ability of those authors plummet for other people who share that identity.\n\nSimilarly, because of the conversations brought by feminism, examinations of masculine subjects and an author's performance of \"maleness\" are prominent in critical studies of novels. For example, some academics studying Victorian fiction spend considerable time examining how masculinity shapes and effects the works, because of its prominence within fiction from the Victorian period.\n\nTraditionally, the publishing industry has distinguished between \"literary fiction\", works lauded as achieving greater literary merit, and \"genre fiction\", novels written within the expectations of genres and published as consumer products. Thus, many novelists become slotted as writers of one or the other. Novelist Kim Wright, however, notes that both publishers and traditional literary novelist are turning towards genre fiction because of their potential for financial success and their increasingly positive reception amongst critics. Wright gives examples of authors like Justin Cronin, Tom Perrotta and Colson Whitehead all making that transition.\n\nHowever, publishing genre novels does not always allow novelist to continue writing outside the genre or within their own interests. In describing the place within the industry, novelist Kim Wright says that many authors, especially authors who usually write literary fiction, worry about \"the danger that genre is a cul-de-sac\" where publishers will only publish similar genre fiction from that author because of reader expectations,\"and that once a writer turns into it, he’ll never get out.\" Similarly, very few authors start in genre fiction and move to more \"literary\" publications; Wright describes novelists like Stephen King as the exception rather than the norm. Other critics and writers defending the merits of genre fiction often point towards King as an example of bridging the gap between popular genres and literary merit.\n\nBoth literary critics and novelists question what role novelists play in society and within art. For example, Eudora Welty writing in 1965 for in her essay \"Must the Novelist Crusade?\" draws a distinction between novelists who report reality by \"taking life as it already exists, not to report it, but to make an object, toward the end that the finished work might contain this life inside it, and offer it to the reader\" and journalists, whose role is to act as \"crusaders\" advocating for particular positions, and using their craft as a political tool. Similarly, writing in the 1950s, Ralph Ellison in his essay \"Society, Morality, and the Novel\", sees the novelist as needing to \"re-create reality in the forms which his personal vision assumes as it plays and struggles with the vivid illusory \"eidetic-like\" imagery left in the mind's eye by the process of social change.\" However, Ellison also describes novelists of the Lost Generation, like Ernest Hemingway, not taking full advantage of the moral weight and influence available to novelists, pointing to Mark Twain and Herman Melville as better examples. A number of such essays, such as literary critic Frank Norris's \"Responsibilities of a Novelist\", highlight such moral and ethical justifications for their approach to both writing novels and criticizing them.\n\nWhen defining her description of the role of the modernist novelist in the essay \"Modern Fiction\", Virginia Woolf argues for a representation of life not interested in the exhaustive specific details represented in realism in favor of representing a \"myriad of impressions\" created in experience life. Her definition made in this essay, and developed in others, helped define the literary movement of modernist literature. She argues that the novelist should represent \"not a series of gig-lamps symmetrically arranged; [rather] life is luminous halo, a semitransparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of the conscious to the end. Is it not the task of the novelist to convey this varying, this unknown and uncircumscribed spirit, whatever aberration or complexity it may display, with as little mixture of the alien and external as possible?\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4458634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4458634", "title": "Placemaking", "text": "Placemaking\n\nPlacemaking is a multi-faceted approach to the planning, design and management of public spaces. Placemaking capitalizes on a local community's assets, inspiration, and potential, with the intention of creating public spaces that promote people's health, happiness, and well being. It is political due to the nature of place identity. Placemaking is both a process and a philosophy that makes use of urban design principles. It can be either official and government led, or community driven grass roots tactical urbanism, such as extending sidewalks with chalk, paint, and planters, or open streets events such as Bogotá, Colombia's Ciclovía. Good placemaking makes use of underutilized space to enhance the urban experience at the pedestrian scale.\n\nThe concepts behind placemaking originated in the 1960s, when writers like Jane Jacobs and William H. Whyte offered groundbreaking ideas about designing cities that catered to people, not just to cars and shopping centers. Their work focused on the importance of lively neighborhoods and inviting public spaces. Jacobs advocated citizen ownership of streets through the now-famous idea of \"eyes on the street.\" Whyte emphasized essential elements for creating social life in public spaces.\n\nThe term came into use in the 1970s by landscape architects, architects and urban planners to describe the process of creating squares, plazas, parks, streets and waterfronts that will attract people because they are pleasurable or interesting. Landscape often plays an important role in the design process. The term encourages disciplines involved in designing the built environment to work together in pursuit of qualities that they each alone are unable to achieve.\n\nBernard Hunt, of HTA Architects noted that: \"We have theories, specialisms, regulations, exhortations, demonstration projects. We have planners. We have highway engineers. We have mixed use, mixed tenure, architecture, community architecture, urban design, neighbourhood strategy. But what seems to have happened is that we have simply lost the art of placemaking; or, put another way, we have lost the simple art of placemaking. We are good at putting up buildings but we are bad at making places.\"\n\nJan Gehl has said \"First life, then spaces, then buildings – the other way around never works\"; and \"In a Society becoming steadily more privatized with private homes, cars, computers, offices and shopping centers, the public component of our lives is disappearing. It is more and more important to make the cities inviting, so we can meet our fellow citizens face to face and experience directly through our senses. Public life in good quality public spaces is an important part of a democratic life and a full life.\"\n\nThe writings of poet Wendell Berry have contributed to an imaginative grasp of place and placemaking, particularly with reference to local ecology and local economy. He writes that, \"If what we see and experience, if our country, does not become real in imagination, then it never can become real to us, and we are forever divided from it... Imagination is a particularizing and a local force, native to the ground underfoot.\"\n\nAccording to Project for Public Spaces, successful placemaking is based on eleven basic principles:\n\nAn important aspect of placemaking is taking into account inputs of the people who will be using the public space most. That is, to say, the community for which the public space is intended. This is important because members of the community are likely to have useful insights into how the space does - or should - function, as well as a historical perspective of the area, and an understanding of what does and does not matter to other members of the community.\n\nPlacemaking is not just about designing a park of plaza with efficient pedestrian circulation. It involves taking into account the interrelations between surrounding retailers, vendors, amenities provided, and activities taking place in the space, then fine-tuning the space with landscape changes, additions of seating, etc., to make all of those elements mesh. The end result should be a cohesive unit that creates greater value for the community than just the sum of its parts.\n\nPartners for political, financial, and intellectual backing are crucial to getting a public space improvement project off the ground. These partners can range from individuals, to private or municipal institutions, to museums, to schools.\n\nBy observing how a public space is used, it is possible to gain an understanding of what the community does and does not like about it. This understanding can be used to assess what activities and amenities may be missing from the space. Even after a public space has been built, observation is key to properly managing it, and evolving it to better suit the community's needs over time.\n\nAs with many other types of project, a placemaking project needs a vision to succeed. This vision should not be the grand design of a single person, but the aggregate conception of the entire community.\n\nA placemaking project does not happen overnight. Do not be discouraged if things do not go exactly as planned at first, or if progress seems slow.\n\nTriangulation, simply put, is the strategic placement of amenities, such that they encourage social interaction, and are used more frequently. For example, \"if a children's reading room in a new library is located so that it is next to a children's playground in a park and a food kiosk is added, more activity will occur than if these facilities were located separately.\" \n\nJust because it hasn't been done doesn't mean it can't be done. What it does mean is that there are few people, in either the private or public sectors, who have the job of creating places.\n\nA public space's form factor should be formulated with its intended function(s) in mind.\n\nIf networking and team building have been executed correctly, public sentiment towards the project should be positive enough to overlook its monetary cost.\n\nPlacemaking is never \"done\". Minor tweaks can be made to improve the space's usefulness to its community over time, and regular maintenance/upkeep of facilities and amenities is a fact of life.\n\nBoth the opportunities available to individuals and the choices made based on those opportunities impact individual, family, and community health. The World Health Organization's definition of health provides an appropriate, broad-reaching understanding of health as a \"resource for everyday life, not the object of living\" and an important frame for discussing the interconnections between \"Place\" and \"Health\". A 2016 report The Case for Healthy Places, from Project for Public Spaces and the Assembly Project, funded by the Knight Foundation and focusing on research related to Shaping Space for Civic Life both offer insight into the current evidence base showing how health and wellbeing are impacted by where you live and the opportunities available to you.\n\nWhile the arts and creative expression play a substantial part in establishing a sense of place, economic growth and production must also play an equally large role in creating a successful place. These two factors are not mutually exclusive, as the arts and cultural economic activity made up $729.6 billion (or 4.2%) of the United States GDP in 2014, and employed 4.7 million workers in 2012. This means that the arts can be deployed as a powerful tool in the creation or rehabilitation of urban spaces.\n\nJamie Bennett, executive director of ArtPlace America, has identified the following four tools used by communities while implementing creative placemaking.\n\n\nGreat places must do more than meet the basic requirements if they want to foster greater community attachment. A strong sense of attachment can result in residents who are more committed to the growth and success of their community. The Knight Foundation conducted a study measuring community attachment, and found that there \nwas very little variation in the primary drivers of attachment rates when compared between different cities across the United States.\n\n\n\nStreets are the stage for activity of everyday life within a city and they have the most potential to be designed to harness a high-quality sense of place. Effective placemaking in the streetscape lends special attention to the streets livability by representing a sense of security, sense of place, visible employment, variety of transportation options, meaningful interactions between residents, \"eyes on the street\" as well as \"social capital\". All of these interactions take place at the \"mesoscale\". Mesoscale is described as the city level of observation between \"macroscale\"—being birdseye view—and \"microscale--\"being textures and individual elements of the streetscape (streetlamp type, building textures, etc.); in other words, mesoscale is the area observable from a humans eyes, for example: between buildings, including storefronts, sidewalks, street trees, and people. Placemaking for a street takes place at both mesoscale and microscale. To be effective placemakers, it is important that planners, architects, and engineers consider designing in the mesoscale when designing for places that are intended to be livable by Whyte's standards.\n\nTools and practices of placemaking that benefit from utilizing the mesoscale context include:\n\n\nAs society changes to accommodate new technologies, urban planners and citizens alike are looking to consult those technologies to enact physical change. One thing that has had a massive impact on western society is the advent of digital technologies, like social media. Urban decision makers are increasingly looking to plan cities based on feedback from community engagement so as to ensure the development of a durable, livable place. With the invention of niche social technologies, communities have shifted their engagement away from local-government-led forums and platforms, to social media groups on websites such as Facebook and Nextdoor to voice concerns, critiques and desires. In a sense, these new platforms have become a Third Place, in reference to Ray Oldenburg’s term.Social media tools such as these show promise for the future of placemaking in that they are being used to reclaim, reinvigorate and activate spaces. These online neighborhood and event-centric groups and forums provide a convenient non-physical space for public discourse and discussion through digital networked interactions to implement change on a hyper-local level; this theory is sometimes referred to as Urban Acupuncture. This type of shift towards a more crowd-sourced planning method can lead to the creation of more relevant and useful and inclusive places with greater sense of place.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In colloquial speech RAL refers to the RAL Classic system, mainly used for varnish and powder coating but nowadays there are reference panels for plastics as well. \nApproved RAL products are provided with a hologram as of early 2013 to make unauthorised versions difficult to produce. Imitations may show different hue and colour when observed under various light sources.\n\nIn 1927 the German \"Reichs-Ausschuß für Lieferbedingungen und Gütesicherung\" (Imperial Commission for Delivery Terms and Quality Assurance) invented a collection of forty colours under the name of \"RAL 840\". Prior to that date manufacturers and customers had to exchange samples to describe a tint, whereas from then on they would rely on numbers.\n\nIn the 1930s the numbers were changed uniformly to four digits and the collection was renamed to \"RAL 840 R\" (R for revised). With tints constantly added to the collection, it was revised again in 1961 and changed to \"RAL 840-HR\", which consists of 210 colours and is in use to this day. In the 1960s the colours were given supplemental names to avoid confusion in case of transposed digits.\n\nAs \"RAL 840-HR\" covered only matte paint the 1980s saw the invention of \"RAL 841-GL\" for glossy surfaces, limited to 193 colours. A main criterion for colours in the RAL Classic collection is to be of \"paramount interest\". Therefore, most of the colours in it are used on warning and traffic signs or are dedicated to government agencies and public services (for example: RAL 1004 - Swiss Postal Service, RAL 1021 - Austrian Postal Service, RAL 1032 - German Postal Service). The first digit relates to the shade of the colour:\nThis collection, which follows the naming of RAL Classic, was invented in 1961. It is nowadays made up of ten colours (RAL 1039-F9 Sand beige, RAL 1040-F9 Clay beige, RAL 6031-F9 Bronze green, RAL 6040-F9-Light olive, RAL 7050-F9 Camouflage grey, RAL 8027-F9 Leather brown, RAL 8031-F9 Sand brown, RAL 9021-F9 Tar black and RAL 6031-HR Bronze green for non-camouflage applications), used by the \"Bundeswehr\" for military camouflage coating.\n\nIn 1993 a new colour matching system was introduced, tailored to the needs of architects, designers and advertisers. It started with 1,688 colours and was revised to 1,625 colours. The colours of RAL Classic and RAL Design do not intersect.\n\nContrary to the preceding systems, RAL Design features no names and its numbering follows a scheme based on the CIELAB colour space, specifically . Each colour is represented by seven digits, grouped in a triple and two pairs, representing hue (000–360 degrees, angle in the CIELab colour wheel), lightness (same as in \"L\"*\"a\"*\"b\"*) and chroma (relative saturation). The three numeric components of almost all RAL Design colours are multiples of 5, most are even divisible by 10.\n\n\nRAL Effect comprises 420 solid colours and, as a particular highlight, seventy metallic colours. It is the first collection from RAL to be based on waterborne paint systems. No use is made of heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and chromates.\n\nThe newly developed, multifunctional double colour fan RAL E 2 underlines the character of RAL Effect.

{"id": "3980269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3980269", "title": "Rasa (aesthetics)", "text": "Rasa (aesthetics)\n\nA rasa (, ) literally means \"juice, essence or taste\". It connotes a concept in Indian arts about the aesthetic flavour of any visual, literary or musical work that evokes an emotion or feeling in the reader or audience but cannot be described. It refers to the emotional flavors/essence crafted into the work by the writer and relished by a 'sensitive spectator' or \"sahṛdaya\" or one with positive taste and mind. \n\nRasas are created by \"bhavas\": the state of mind.\n\nThe \"rasa\" theory is mentioned in Chapter 6 of the ancient Sanskrit text \"Natya Shastra\", attributed to Bharata Muni, but its most complete exposition in drama, songs and other performance arts is found in the works of the Kashmiri Shaivite philosopher Abhinavagupta (c. 1000 CE). According to the \"Rasa\" theory of the \"Natya Shastra\", entertainment is a desired effect of performance arts but not the primary goal, and the primary goal is to transport the individual in the audience into another parallel reality, full of wonder and bliss, where he experiences the essence of his own consciousness, and reflects on spiritual and moral questions.\n\nAlthough the concept of rasa is fundamental to many forms of Indian arts including dance, music, theatre, painting, sculpture, and literature, the interpretation and implementation of a particular rasa differs between different styles and schools. The Indian theory of \"rasa\" is also found in the Hindu arts and Ramayana musical productions in Bali and Java (Indonesia), but with regional creative evolution.\nThe word \"rasa\" appears in ancient Vedic literature. In \"Rigveda\", it connotes a liquid, an extract and flavor. In \"Atharvaveda\", \"rasa\" in many contexts means \"taste\", and also the sense of \"the sap of grain\". According to Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe – a professor of Drama, \"rasa\" in the Upanishads refers to the \"essence, self-luminous consciousness, quintessence\" but also \"taste\" in some contexts. In post-Vedic literature, the word generally connotes \"extract, essence, juice or tasty liquid\".\n\nRasa in an aesthetic sense is suggested in the Vedic literature, but the oldest surviving manuscripts, with the \"rasa\" theory of Hinduism, are of \"Natya Shastra\". The Aitareya Brahmana in chapter 6, for example, states:\n\nThe Sanskrit text \"Natya shastra\" presents the \"rasa\" theory in Chapter 6, a text attributed to Bharata Muni. The text begins its discussion with a sutra called in Indian aesthetics as the \"rasa sutra\":\n\nAccording to the \"Natya shastra\", the goals of theatre are to empower aesthetic experience and deliver emotional \"rasa\". The text states that the aim of art is manifold. In many cases, it aims to produce repose and relief for those exhausted with labor, or distraught with grief, or laden with misery, or struck by austere times. Yet entertainment is an effect, but not the primary goal of arts according to \"Natya shastra\". The primary goal is to create \"rasa\" so as to lift and transport the spectators, unto the expression of ultimate reality and transcendent values.\n\nThe \"Abhinavabhāratī\" is the most studied commentary on \"Natyasastra\", written by Abhinavagupta (950–1020 CE), who referred to \"Natyasastra\" also as the \"Natyaveda\". Abhinavagupta's analysis of \"Natyasastra\" is notable for its extensive discussion of aesthetic and ontological questions. According to Abhinavagupta, the success of an artistic performance is measured not by the reviews, awards or recognition the production receives, but only when it is performed with skilled precision, devoted faith and pure concentration such that the artist gets the audience emotionally absorbed into the art and immerses the spectator with pure joy of \"rasa\" experience.\n\nAlthough the concept of rasa is fundamental to many forms of Indian art, including dance, music, musical theatre, cinema and literature, the treatment, interpretation, usage and actual performance of a particular rasa differs greatly between different styles and schools of abhinaya, and the huge regional differences even within one style.\n\nA rasa is the developed relishable state of a permanent mood, which is called sthayi bhava. This development towards a relishable state results by the interplay on it of attendant emotional conditions which are called Vibhavas, anubhavas and sanchari/ vyabhichari bhavas. The production of aesthetic rasa from bhavas is analogous to the production of tastes/juices of kinds from food with condiments, curries, pastes and spices. This is explained by the quote below:\n\nThe Rishi Praskanva insists (Rig Veda I.46.6) that the sources of knowledge, some of which are open and some hidden, they are to be sought and found by the seekers after Truth, these sources are not available everywhere, anywhere and at all times. In this context Rishi Agastya (Rig Veda I.187.4) stating thus – \n\nतव॒ त्ये पि॑तो॒ रसा॒ रजां॒स्यनु॒ विष्ठि॑ताः । <br>\nदि॒वि वाता॑ इव श्रि॒ताः ॥\n\nreminds the ardent seekers about the six kinds of Rasa or taste which food has but which all tastes cannot be found in one place or item, for these tastes are variously distributed throughout space. Food, in this context, means matter or objects or thoughts, which are all produced effects; effects that are produced owing to various causes. The Rasas are the unique qualities which bring about variety in things created whose source is one and one only.\n\nBharata Muni enunciated the eight Rasas in the \"Nātyasāstra\", an ancient Sanskrit text of dramatic theory and other performance arts, written between 200 BC and 200 AD. In the Indian performing arts, a \"rasa\" is a sentiment or emotion evoked in each member of the audience by the art. The \"Natya Shastra\" mentions six rasa in one section, but in the dedicated section on \"rasa\" it states and discusses eight primary \"rasa\". Each rasa, according to Nātyasāstra, has a presiding deity and a specific colour. There are 4 pairs of rasas. For instance, Hāsya arises out of Sringara. The Aura of a frightened person is black, and the aura of an angry person is red. Bharata Muni established the following:\n\n\nA ninth rasa was added by later authors. This addition had to undergo a good deal of struggle between the sixth and the tenth centuries, before it could be accepted by the majority of the Alankarikas, and the expression \"Navarasa\" (the nine rasas), could come into vogue.\n\n\nShānta-rasa functions as an equal member of the set of rasas, but it is simultaneously distinct as being the most clear form of aesthetic bliss. Abhinavagupta likens it to the string of a jeweled necklace; while it may not be the most appealing for most people, it is the string that gives form to the necklace, allowing the jewels of the other eight rasas to be relished. Relishing the rasas and particularly shānta-rasa is hinted as being as-good-as but never-equal-to the bliss of Self-realization experienced by yogis.\n\nAccording to the \"nATyashAstra\", bhAvas are of three types: sthAyI, sanchari, sAttvika based on how they are developed or enacted during the aesthetic experience. This is seen in the following passage:\n\nपुनश्च भावान्वक्ष्यामि स्थायिसञ्चारिसत्त्वजान्॥६.१६॥\nSome bhAvas are also described as being anubhAva if they arise from some other bhAva.\n\nThe \"Natyasastra\" lists eight \"bhavas\" with eight corresponding \"rasas\": \n\nThis list is from the following passage:\n\nरतिहासश्च शोकश्च क्रोधोत्साहौ भयं तथा।\nजुगुप्सा विस्मयश्चेति स्थायिभावाः प्रकीर्तिताः॥६.१७॥\nSanchari Bhavas are those crossing feelings which are ancillary to a permanent mood. A list of 33 bhAvas are identified therein.\nनिर्वेदग्लानिशङ्काख्यास्तथासूया मदः श्रमः।\nआलस्यं चैव दैन्यं च चिन्तामोहः स्मृतिर्धृतिः॥१८॥\nव्रीडा चपलता हर्ष आवेगो जडता तथा।\nगर्वो विषाद औत्सुक्यं निद्रापस्मार एव च॥१९॥\nसुप्तं विबोधोऽमर्षश्चापि अवहित्थं अथोग्रता।\nमतिर्व्याधिस्तथा उन्मादस्तथा मरणमेव च॥२०॥\nत्रासश्चैव वितर्कश्च विज्ञेया व्यभिचारिणः।\nत्रयस्त्रिंशदमी भावाः समाख्यातास्तु नामतः॥२१॥\nThe sAtvika-bhAvAs themselves are listed below.\n\nस्तम्भः स्वेदोऽथ रोमाञ्चः स्वरभेदोऽथ वेपथुः।\nवैवर्ण्यं अश्रु-प्रलय इत्यष्टौ सात्विकाः स्मृताः॥२२॥\n\nThese are explained by Bharata and Dhanika as below:\n\n\"सत्त्वं नाम मनःप्रभवम्। एतदेव समाहितमनस्त्वादुत्पद्यते। \" इति भरतः।\n\"एतदेवास्य सत्त्वं यत् दुःखितेन प्रहर्षितेन वा अश्रु-रोमाञ्चादयो निवर्त्यन्ते।\nतेन सत्त्वेन निर्वृत्ता भावाः - सात्त्विकाः भावाः। तद्भावभावनं च भावः।\" इति धनिकः।\n\"पृथग् भावा भवन्त्यन्येऽनुभावत्वेऽपि सात्त्विकाः।\nसत्त्वादेव समुत्पत्तेस्तच्च तद्भावभावनम्॥\" इति धनिकः।\n\nThus, physical expression of the feelings of the mind are called sAttvika.\n\nAccording to \"Natya shastra\", a \"rasa\" is a synthetic phenomenon and the goal of any creative performance art, oratory, painting or literature. Wallace Dace translates the ancient text's explanation of \"rasa\" as \"a relish that of an elemental human emotion like love, pity, fear, heroism or mystery, which forms the dominant note of a dramatic piece; this dominant emotion, as tasted by the audience, has a different quality from that which is aroused in real life; rasa may be said to be the original emotion transfigured by aesthetic delight\".\n\nRasas are created through a wide range of means, and the ancient Indian texts discuss many such means. For example, one way is through the use of gestures and facial expressions of the actors. Expressing \"Rasa\" in classical Indian dance form is referred to as Rasa-abhinaya. \n\nThe theory of rasas forms the aesthetic underpinning of all Indian classical dance and theatre, such as Bharatanatyam, Kathakali, Kathak, Kuchipudi, Odissi, Manipuri, Kudiyattam, and others.\n\nIn Indian classical music, each \"raga\" is an inspired creation for a specific mood, where the musician or ensemble creates the \"rasa\" in the listener. However, predominantly all \"ragas\" and musical performances in Hindu traditions aim at one of six \"rasa\", wherein music is a form of painting \"love, compassion, peace, heroism, comic or the feeling of wonder\" within the listener. Anger, disgust, fear and such emotions are not the subject of \"raga\", but they are part of Indian theories on dramatic arts. Of the six \"rasa\" that are aimed at in Indian music, each has sub-categories. For example, love \"rasa\" in Hindu imagination has many musical flavors, such as erotic love (\"sringar\") and spiritual devotional love (\"bhakti\").\nIn the theories of Indian poetics, ancient scholars state that the effectiveness of a literary composition depends both on what is stated and how it is stated (words, grammar, rhythm), that is the suggested meaning and the experience of \"rasa\". Among the most celebrated in Hindu traditions on the theory of poetics and literary works, are 5th-century Bhartrhari and the 9th-century Anandavardhana, but the theoretical tradition on integrating \"rasa\" into literary artworks likely goes back to a more ancient period. This is generally discussed under the Indian concepts of \"Dhvani\", \"Sabdatattva\" and \"Sphota\".\n\nThe literary work \"Bhagavata Purana\" deploys \"rasa\", presenting Bhakti of Krishna in aesthetic terms. The rasa it presents is as an emotional relish, a mood, which is called Sthayi Bhava. This development towards a relishable state results by the interplay on it of attendant emotional conditions which are called \"Vibhavas\", \"Anubhavas\" and \"Sanchari Bhavas\". Vibhavas means Karana or cause: it is of two kinds - \"Alambana\", the personal or human object and substratum, and \"Uddipana\", the excitants. Anubhava, as the name signifies, means the ensuants or effects following the rise of the emotion. \"Sanchari Bhavas\" are those crossing feelings which are ancillary to a mood. Later scholars added more emotional states such as the \"Saatvika Bhavas\".\n\nIn the Indian theories on sculpture and architecture (\"Shilpa Shastras\"), the \"rasa\" theories, in part, drive the forms, shapes, arrangements and expressions in images and structures. Some Indian texts on \"Shilpa\" on image carving and making, suggest nine \"rasas\".\n\n\"Rasa\" has been an important influence on the cinema of India. Satyajit Ray has applied the \"Rasa\" method of classical Sanskrit drama to movies, for instance in \"The Apu Trilogy\" (1955–1959).\n\nIn Hindi cinema, it is the theme of the film Naya Din Nayi Raat, where Sanjeev Kumar played nine characters corresponding to nine \"Rasa\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "74577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74577", "title": "Rear Window", "text": "Rear Window\n\nRear Window is a 1954 American Technicolor mystery thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and written by John Michael Hayes based on Cornell Woolrich's 1942 short story \"It Had to Be Murder\". Originally released by Paramount Pictures, the film stars James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey, Thelma Ritter, and Raymond Burr. It was screened at the 1954 Venice Film Festival.\n\nThe film is considered by many filmgoers, critics, and scholars to be one of Hitchcock's best and one of the greatest films ever made. It received four Academy Award nominations and was ranked number 42 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list and number 48 on the 10th-anniversary edition, and in 1997 was added to the United States National Film Registry in the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nRecuperating from a broken leg, adventuresome professional photographer L. B. \"Jeff\" Jefferies (Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair in his Greenwich Village apartment. His rear window looks out onto a courtyard and several other apartments. During a powerful heat wave, he watches his neighbors, who keep their windows open to stay cool.\n\nHe observes a flamboyant dancer he nicknames \"Miss Torso\"; a single middle-aged woman he calls \"Miss Lonelyhearts\"; a talented, single, middle-aged composer-pianist; several married couples; a female sculptor; and Lars Thorwald (Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a bedridden wife.\n\nJeff's sophisticated, beautiful socialite girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), visits him regularly, as does his insurance company's nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Stella wants Jeff to settle down and marry Lisa, but Jeff is reluctant.\n\nOne night during a thunderstorm, Jeff hears a woman scream \"Don't!\" and then the sound of breaking glass. Later, he is awakened by thunder and observes Thorwald leaving his apartment. Thorwald makes repeated late-night trips carrying his sample case. The next morning, Jeff notices that Thorwald's wife is gone, and then sees Thorwald cleaning a large knife and handsaw. Later, Thorwald ties a large trunk with heavy rope and has moving men haul it away. Jeff discusses all this with Lisa and with Stella.\n\nJeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. Jeff explains this to his friend Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey), a New York City Police detective, and asks him to do some research. Doyle finds nothing suspicious; apparently, Mrs. Thorwald is upstate, and picked up the trunk herself.\n\nSoon after, a neighbor's dog is found dead with its neck broken. The dog's owner yells across the courtyard, complaining of her neighbors' callous disregard of others. All the neighbors run to their windows to see what is happening, except for Thorwald, whose cigar can be seen glowing as he sits quietly in his dark apartment.\n\nCertain that Thorwald is also guilty of killing the dog, Jeff asks Lisa to slip an accusatory note under his door, so Jeff can watch his reaction when he reads it. Then, as a pretext to get Thorwald out of his apartment, Jeff telephones him and arranges a meeting at a bar. He believes Thorwald buried something incriminating in the courtyard flower bed, and killed the dog to stop it digging there, so when Thorwald leaves, Lisa and Stella dig up the flowers; they find nothing.\n\nMuch to Jeff's amazement and admiration, Lisa then climbs the fire escape to Thorwald's apartment and clambers in through an open window. When Thorwald returns and grabs Lisa, Jeff calls the police, who arrive in time to save her by arresting her. Jeff sees Lisa has her hands behind her back, wiggling her finger with Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring on it. Thorwald notices this, and, realizing that she is signaling to someone, he sees Jeff across the courtyard.\n\nJeff phones Doyle and leaves an urgent message. Stella heads for the police station to post bail for Lisa. When his phone rings, Jeff assumes it is Doyle, and says that the suspect has left the apartment. When no one answers, Jeff realizes that Thorwald himself had called, and is heading over to confront him. When Thorwald enters, Jeff repeatedly sets off his camera flashbulbs, temporarily blinding him. However, Thorwald grabs Jeff and manages to push him out of the open window, as Jeff is yelling for help. Police officers enter the apartment as he falls to the ground; other officers have run over to break his fall. Thorwald confesses to the police soon afterward.\n\nA few days later, the heat has lifted, and Jeff rests peacefully in his wheelchair, now with casts on both legs. The lonely neighbor is chatting with the pianist in his apartment, the dancer's lover returns home from the army, the couple whose dog was killed have a new dog, and the newly married couple are bickering.\n\nLisa reclines on the daybed in Jeff's apartment, wearing jeans and apparently reading a book titled \"Beyond the High Himalayas\". As soon as Jeff falls asleep, Lisa puts the book down and happily opens a fashion magazine.\n\n\nUncredited\n\nCast notes\n\nThe film was shot entirely at Paramount studios, which included an enormous indoor set to replicate a Greenwich Village courtyard. Set designers Hal Pereira and Joseph MacMillan Johnson spent six weeks building the extremely detailed and complex set, which ended up being the largest of its kind at Paramount. One of the unique features of the set was its massive drainage system, constructed to accommodate the rain sequence in the film. They also built the set around a highly nuanced lighting system which was able to create natural-looking lighting effects for both the day and night scenes. Though the address given in the film is 125 W. Ninth Street in New York's Greenwich Village, the set was actually based on a real courtyard located at 125 Christopher Street.\n\nIn addition to the meticulous care and detail put into the set, careful attention was also given to sound, including the use of natural sounds and music that would drift across the courtyard and into Jefferies' apartment. At one point, the voice of Bing Crosby can be heard singing \"To See You Is to Love You\", originally from the 1952 Paramount film \"Road to Bali\". Also heard on the soundtrack are versions of songs popularized earlier in the decade by Nat King Cole (\"Mona Lisa\", 1950) and Dean Martin (\"That's Amore\", 1952), along with segments from Leonard Bernstein's score for Jerome Robbins' ballet \"Fancy Free\" (1944), Richard Rodgers' song \"Lover\" (1932), and \"M'appari tutt'amor\" from Friedrich von Flotow's opera \"Martha\" (1844), most borrowed from Paramount's music publisher, Famous Music.\n\nHitchcock used costume designer Edith Head on all of his Paramount films.\n\nAlthough veteran Hollywood composer Franz Waxman is credited with the score for the film, his contributions were limited to the opening and closing titles and the piano tune (\"Lisa\") written by one of the neighbors, a composer (Ross Bagdasarian), during the film. This was Waxman's final score for Hitchcock. The director used primarily \"diegetic\" sounds—sounds arising from the normal life of the characters—throughout the film.\n\nA \"benefit world premiere\" for the film, with United Nations officials and \"prominent members of the social and entertainment worlds\" in attendance, was held on August 4, 1954, at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City, with proceeds going to the American–Korean Foundation (an aid organization founded soon after the end of the Korean War and headed by Milton S. Eisenhower, brother of President Eisenhower).\n\nThe movie was released wide on September 1, 1954.\n\nThe movie went on to earn an estimated $5.3 million at the North American box office in 1954.\n\nThe film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and is considered one of Hitchcock's finest films. On the website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has been universally praised, garnering a 100% certified fresh rating, based on 61 reviews, with the consensus stating that \"Hitchcock exerted full potential of suspense in this masterpiece.\"\n\nCritic Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" attended the benefit premiere, and in his review called the film a \"tense and exciting exercise\" and Hitchcock a director whose work has a \"maximum of build-up to the punch, a maximum of carefully tricked deception and incidents to divert and amuse.\" Crowther also notes: \"Mr. Hitchcock's film is not 'significant.' What it has to say about people and human nature is superficial and glib, but it does expose many facets of the loneliness of city life, and it tacitly demonstrates the impulse of morbid curiosity. The purpose of it is sensation, and that it generally provides in the colorfulness of its detail and in the flood of menace toward the end.\"\n\n\"Time\" called it \"just possibly the second-most entertaining picture (after \"The 39 Steps\") ever made by Alfred Hitchcock\" and a film in which there is \"never an instant ... when Director Hitchcock is not in minute and masterly control of his material.\" The same review did note \"occasional studied lapses of taste and, more important, the eerie sense a Hitchcock audience has of reacting in a manner so carefully foreseen as to seem practically foreordained.\" \"Variety\" called the film \"one of Alfred Hitchcock's better thrillers\" which \"combines technical and artistic skills in a manner that makes this an unusually good piece of murder mystery entertainment.\"\n\nNearly 30 years after the film's initial release, Roger Ebert reviewed the Universal re-release in October 1983, after Hitchcock's estate was settled. He said the film \"develops such a clean, uncluttered line from beginning to end that we're drawn through it (and into it) effortlessly. The experience is not so much like watching a movie, as like ... well, like spying on your neighbors. Hitchcock traps us right from the first ... And because Hitchcock makes us accomplices in Stewart's voyeurism, we're along for the ride. When an enraged man comes bursting through the door to kill Stewart, we can't detach ourselves, because we looked too, and so we share the guilt and in a way we deserve what's coming to him.\"\n\nIn his book, \"Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rear Window\", John Belton addresses the underlying issues of voyeurism, that are evident in the film. He asserts \"Rear Window's\" story is \"about\" spectacle; it explores the fascination with looking and the attraction of that which is being looked at.\"\n\nJohn Fawell notes in Dennis Perry's book, \"Hitchcock and Poe: The Legacy of Delight and Terror\", that Hitchcock \"recognized that the darkest aspect of voyeurism…is our desire for awful things to happen to people...to make ourselves feel better, and to relieve ourselves of the burden of examining our own lives.\" The Master of Terror challenges the audience, forcing them to peer through his rear window and become exposed to, as Donald Spoto calls it in his 1976 book \"The Art of Alfred Hitchcock: Fifty Years of His Motion Pictures\", the \"social contagion\" of acting as voyeur.\n\nIn an explicit example of a condemnation of voyeurism, Stella expresses her outrage at Jeffries' voyeuristic habits, saying, \"In the old days, they'd put your eyes out with a red hot poker\" and \"What people ought to do is get outside and look in for a change.\"\n\nOne climactic scene in the film portrays both the positive and negative effects of voyeurism. Driven by curiosity and incessant watching, with Jeffries watching from his window, Lisa sneaks into Thorwald's second-floor apartment, looking for clues, and is apprehended by him. Jeffries is in obvious anxiety and is overcome with panic as he sees Thorwald walk into the apartment and notice the irregular placement of the purse on the bed. Jeffries anxiously jitters in his wheelchair, and grabs his telephoto camera to watch the situation unfold, eventually calling the police because Miss Lonelyhearts is contemplating suicide in the neighboring apartment. Chillingly, Jeffries watches Lisa in Thorwald's apartment rather than keeping an eye on the woman about to commit suicide. Thorwald turns off the lights, shutting off Jeffries' sole means of communication with and protection of Lisa; Jeffries still pays attention to the pitch-black apartment instead of Miss Lonelyhearts. The tension Jeffries feels is unbearable and acutely distressing as he realizes that he is responsible for Lisa now that he cannot see her. The police go to the Thorwald apartment, the lights flicker on, and any danger coming toward Lisa is temporarily dismissed. Although Lisa is taken to jail, Jeffries is utterly mesmerized by her dauntless actions.\n\nWith further analysis, Jeffries' positive evolution understandably would be impossible without voyeurism—or as Robin Wood puts it in his 1989 book \"Hitchcock's Films Revisited\", \"the indulging of morbid curiosity and the consequences of that indulgence.\"\n\nIn 1997, \"Rear Window\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". By this time, the film interested other directors with its theme of voyeurism, and other reworkings of the film soon followed, which included Brian De Palma's 1984 film \"Body Double\" and Phillip Noyce's 1993 film \"Sliver\".\n\n\"Rear Window\" was restored by the team of Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz for its 1999 limited theatrical re-release (using Technicolor dye-transfer prints for the first time in this title's history) and the Collector's Edition DVD release in 2000.\n\nAmerican Film Institute included the film as number 42 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies, number 14 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills, number 48 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and number three in AFI's 10 Top 10 (Mysteries).\n\nOwnership of the copyright in Woolrich's original story was eventually litigated before the Supreme Court of the United States in \"Stewart v. Abend\". The film was copyrighted in 1954 by Patron Inc., a production company set up by Hitchcock and Stewart. As a result, Stewart and Hitchcock's estate became involved in the Supreme Court case, and Sheldon Abend became a producer of the 1998 remake of \"Rear Window\".\n\n\"Rear Window\" is one of several of Hitchcock's films originally released by Paramount Pictures, for which Hitchcock retained the copyright, and which was later acquired by Universal Studios in 1983 from Hitchcock's estate.\n\nOn September 4, 2012, Universal Studios Home Entertainment re-released \"Rear Window\" to DVD, as a Region 1 widescreen DVD. This release includes the items available in the 2001 release.\n\nOn May 6, 2014, Universal Studios Home Entertainment released \"Rear Window\" to Blu-ray format, with slightly expanded extras.\n\n\"Rear Window\" has been repeatedly retold, parodied, or referenced.\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nLiterature\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

{"id": "54189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54189", "title": "Surrealist automatism", "text": "Surrealist automatism\n\nSurrealist automatism is a method of art-making in which the artist suppresses conscious control over the making process, allowing the unconscious mind to have great sway. Early 20th-century Dadaists, such as Hans Arp, made some use of this method through chance operations. Surrealist artists, most notably André Masson, adapted to art the automatic writing method of André Breton and Philippe Soupault who composed with it \"Les Champs Magnétiques\" (The Magnetic Fields) in 1919. \"The Automatic Message\" (1933) was one of Breton's significant theoretical works about automatism.\n\nAutomatism has taken on many forms: the automatic writing and drawing initially (and still to this day) explored by the surrealists can be compared to similar or parallel phenomena, such as the non-idiomatic improvisation.\n\"Pure psychic automatism\" was how André Breton defined Surrealism, and while the definition has proved capable of significant expansion, automatism remains of prime importance in the movement.\n\nAutomatic drawing was pioneered by the English artist Austin Osman Spare who wrote a chapter, Automatic Drawing as a Means to Art, in his book, \"The Book of Pleasure\" (1913). Other artists who also practised automatic drawing later include, in France André Masson, Joan Miró, Salvador Dalí, Jean Arp and André Breton.\n\nThe technique of automatic drawing was transferred to painting (as seen in Miró's paintings which often started out as automatic drawings), and has been adapted to other media; there have even been automatic \"drawings\" in computer graphics. Pablo Picasso was also thought to have expressed a type of automatic drawing in his later work, and particularly in his etchings and lithographic suites of the 1960s.\n\nAutomatic drawing (distinguished from drawn expression of mediums) was developed by the surrealists, as a means of expressing the subconscious. In automatic drawing, the hand is allowed to move \"randomly\" across the paper. In applying chance and accident to mark-making, drawing is to a large extent freed of rational control. Hence the drawing produced may be attributed in part to the subconscious and may reveal something of the psyche, which would otherwise be repressed. Examples of automatic drawing were produced by mediums and practitioners of the psychic arts. It was thought by some Spiritualists to be a spirit control that was producing the drawing while physically taking control of the medium's body.\n\nMost of the surrealists' automatic drawings were illusionistic, or more precisely, they developed into such drawings when representational forms seemed to suggest themselves. In the 1940s and 1950s the French-Canadian group called Les Automatistes pursued creative work (chiefly painting) based on surrealist principles. They abandoned any trace of representation in their use of automatic drawing. This is perhaps a more pure form of automatic drawing since it can be almost entirely involuntary – to develop a representational form requires the conscious mind to take over the process of drawing, unless it is entirely accidental and thus incidental. These artists, led by Paul-Émile Borduas, sought to proclaim an entity of universal values and ethics proclaimed in their manifesto \"Refus Global\".\n\nAs alluded to above, surrealist artists often found that their use of \"automatic drawing\" was not entirely automatic, rather it involved some form of conscious intervention to make the image or painting visually acceptable or comprehensible, \"...Masson admitted that his 'automatic' imagery involved a two-fold process of unconscious and conscious activity...\"\n\nSome Romanian surrealists invented a number of surrealist techniques (such as cubomania, entoptic graphomania, and the movement of liquid down a vertical surface) that purported to take automatism to an absurd point, and the name given, \"surautomatism\", implies that the methods \"go beyond\" automatism, but this position is controversial.\n\nThe notion of automatism is also rooted in the artistic movement of the same name founded by Montreal artist Paul-Emile Borduas in 1942; himself influenced by the Dadaist movement as well as André Breton. He, as well as a dozen other artists from Quebec's artistic scene, very much under restrictive and authoritarian rule in that period, signed the \"Global Refusal\" manifesto, in which the artists called upon North American society (specifically in the culturally unique environment of Quebec), to take notice and act upon the societal evolution projected by these new cultural paradigms opened by the Automatist movement as well as other influences in the 1940s.\n\nThe computer, like the typewriter, can be used to produce automatic writing and automatic poetry. The practice of automatic drawing, originally performed with pencil or pen and paper, has also been adapted to mouse and monitor, and other automatic methods have also been either adapted from non-digital media, or invented specifically for the computer. For instance, filters have been automatically run in some bitmap editor programs such as Photoshop and GIMP, and computer-controlled brushes have been used to \"simulate\" automatism.\nGrandview — a software application created in 2011 for the Mac — displays one word at a time across the entire screen as a user types, facilitating automatic writing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "102194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102194", "title": "Sutton Hoo", "text": "Sutton Hoo\n\nSutton Hoo, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, is the site of two 6th- and early 7th-century cemeteries. One cemetery contained an undisturbed ship-burial, including a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artefacts of outstanding art-historical and archaeological significance, most of which are now in the British Museum in London. The site is in the care of the National Trust.\n\nSutton Hoo is of primary importance to early medieval historians because it sheds light on a period of English history that is on the margin between myth, legend, and historical documentation. Use of the site culminated at a time when Rædwald, the ruler of the East Angles, held senior power among the English people and played a dynamic if ambiguous part in the establishment of Christian rulership in England; it is generally thought most likely that he is the person buried in the ship. The site has been vital in understanding the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of East Anglia and the whole early Anglo-Saxon period.\n\nThe ship-burial, probably dating from the early 7th century and excavated in 1939, is one of the most magnificent archaeological finds in England for its size and completeness, far-reaching connections, the quality and beauty of its contents, and the profound interest of the burial ritual itself. The initial excavation was privately sponsored by the landowner. When the significance of the find became apparent, national experts took over. Subsequent archaeological campaigns, particularly in the late 1960s and late 1980s, have explored the wider site and many other individual burials. The most significant artefacts from the ship-burial, displayed in the British Museum, are those found in the burial chamber, including a suite of metalwork dress fittings in gold and gems, a ceremonial helmet, shield and sword, a lyre, and many pieces of silver plate from Byzantium. The ship-burial has, from the time of its discovery, prompted comparisons with the world described in the heroic Old English poem \"Beowulf\", which is set in southern Sweden. It is in that region, especially at Vendel, that close archaeological parallels to the ship-burial are found, both in its general form and in details of the military equipment contained in the burial.\n\nAlthough it is the ship-burial that commands the greatest attention from tourists, two separate cemeteries also have rich historical meaning because of their position in relation to the Deben estuary and the North Sea, and their relation to other sites in the immediate neighborhood. Of the two grave fields found at Sutton Hoo, one (the \"Sutton Hoo cemetery\") had long been known to exist because it consists of a group of approximately 20 earthen burial mounds that rise slightly above the horizon of the hill-spur when viewed from the opposite bank. The other, called here the \"new\" burial ground, is situated on a second hill-spur close to the present Exhibition Hall, about 500 m upstream of the first. It was discovered and partially explored in 2000 during preliminary work for the construction of the hall. This site also had burials under mounds but was not known because these mounds had long since been flattened by agricultural activity. There is a visitor centre with many original and replica artefacts and a reconstruction of the ship-burial chamber. The burial field can be toured in the summer months and at weekends and school holidays year-round.\n\nSutton Hoo is the name of an area spread along the bank of the River Deben opposite the harbour of the small Suffolk town of Woodbridge, about 7 miles (11 km) from the North Sea, overlooking the tidal estuary a little below the lowest convenient fording place. It formed a path of entry into East Anglia during the period that followed the end of Roman imperial rule in the 5th century.\n\nSouth of Woodbridge, there are 6th-century burial grounds at Rushmere, Little Bealings, and Tuddenham St Martin and circling Brightwell Heath, the site of mounds that date from the Bronze Age. There are cemeteries of a similar date at Rendlesham and Ufford. A ship-burial at Snape is the only one in England that can be compared to the example at Sutton Hoo.\n\nThe territory between the Orwell and the watersheds of the Alde and Deben rivers may have been an early centre of royal power, originally centred upon Rendlesham or Sutton Hoo, and a primary component in the formation of the East Anglian kingdom: In the early 7th century, Gipeswic (modern Ipswich) began its growth as a centre for foreign trade, Botolph's monastery at Iken was founded by royal grant in 654, and Bede identified Rendlesham as the site of Æthelwold's royal dwelling.\n\nThere is evidence that Sutton Hoo was occupied during the Neolithic period, 3000 BCE, when woodland in the area was cleared by agriculturalists. They dug small pits that contained flint-tempered earthenware pots. Several pits were near to hollows where large trees had been uprooted: the Neolithic farmers may have associated the hollows with the pots.\n\nDuring the Bronze Age, when agricultural communities living in Britain were adopting the newly introduced technology of metalworking, timber-framed roundhouses were built at Sutton Hoo, with wattle and daub walling and thatched roofs. The best surviving example contained a ring of upright posts, up to in diameter, with one pair suggesting an entrance to the south-east. In the central hearth, a faience bead had been dropped. The farmers who dwelt in this house used decorated Beaker-style pottery, cultivated barley, oats, and wheat, and collected hazelnuts. They dug ditches that marked the surrounding grassland into sections, indicating land ownership. The acidic sandy soil eventually become leached and infertile, and it was likely that for this reason, the settlement was eventually abandoned, to be replaced in the Middle Bronze Age (1500-1000 BCE) by sheep or cattle, which were enclosed by wooden stakes.\n\nDuring the Iron Age, iron replaced copper and bronze as the dominant form of metal used in the British Isles. In the Middle Iron Age (around 500 BCE), people living in the Sutton Hoo area began to grow crops again, dividing the land into small enclosures now known as Celtic fields. The use of narrow trenches implies grape cultivation, whilst in other places, small pockets of dark soil indicate that big cabbages may have been grown. This cultivation continued into the Romano-British period, from 43 to around 410. Life for the Britons remained unaffected by the arrival of the Romans. Several artefacts from the period, including a few fragments of pottery and a discarded fibula, have been found. As the peoples of Western Europe were encouraged by the Empire to maximise the use of land for growing crops, the area around Sutton Hoo suffered degradation and soil loss. It was eventually abandoned and became overgrown.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the Romans from southern Britain after 410, the remaining population slowly adopted the language, customs and beliefs of the Germanic Angles, Saxons and Jutes. Much of the process may have been due to cultural appropriation, as there was a widespread migration into Britain. The people who arrived may have been relatively small in numbers and aggressive toward the local populations they encountered.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxons developed new cultural traits. Their language developed into Old English, a Germanic language that was different from the languages previously spoken in Britain, and they were pagans, following a polytheistic religion. Differences in their daily material culture changed, as they stopped living in roundhouses and constructed rectangular timber homes similar to those found in Denmark and northern Germany. Their jewellery began to exhibit the increasing influence of Migration Period Art from continental Europe.\n\nDuring this period, southern Britain became divided up into a number of small independent kingdoms. Several pagan cemeteries from the kingdom of the East Angles have been found, most notably at Spong Hill and Snape, where a large number of cremations and inhumations were found. Many of the graves were accompanied by grave goods, which included combs, tweezers and brooches, as well as weapons. Sacrificed animals had been placed in the graves.\n\nAt the time when the Sutton Hoo cemetery was in use, the River Deben would have formed part of a busy trading and transportation network. A number of settlements grew up along the river, most of which would have been small farmsteads, although it seems likely that there was a larger administrative centre as well, where the local aristocracy held court. Archaeologists have speculated that such a centre may have existed at Rendlesham, Melton, Bromeswell or at Sutton Hoo. It has been suggested that the burial mounds used by wealthier families were later appropriated as sites for early churches. In such cases, the mounds would have been destroyed before the churches were constructed.\n\nThe Sutton Hoo grave field contained about twenty barrows; it was reserved for people who were buried individually with objects that indicated that they had exceptional wealth or prestige. It was used in this way from around 575 to 625 and contrasts with the Snape cemetery, where the ship-burial and furnished graves were added to a graveyard of buried pots containing cremated ashes.\n\nMartin Carver believes that the cremation burials at Sutton Hoo were \"among the earliest\" in the cemetery. Two were excavated in 1938. Under Mound 3 were the ashes of a man and a horse placed on a wooden trough or dugout bier, a Frankish iron-headed throwing-axe, and imported objects from the eastern Mediterranean, including the lid of a bronze ewer, part of a miniature carved plaque depicting a winged Victory, and fragments of decorated bone from a casket. Under Mound 4 was the cremated remains of a man and a woman, with a horse and perhaps also a dog, as well as fragments of bone gaming-pieces.\n\nIn Mounds 5, 6, and 7, Carver found cremations deposited in bronze bowls. In Mound 5 were found gaming-pieces, small iron shears, a cup, and an ivory box. Mound 7 also contained gaming-pieces, as well as an iron-bound bucket, a sword-belt fitting and a drinking vessel, together with the remains of horse, cattle, red deer, sheep, and pig that had been burnt with the deceased on a pyre. Mound 6 contained cremated animals, gaming-pieces, a sword-belt fitting, and a comb. The Mound 18 grave was very damaged, but of similar kind. Two cremations were found during the 1960s exploration to define the extent of Mound 5, together with two inhumations and a pit with a skull and fragments of decorative foil. In level areas between the mounds, Carver found three furnished inhumations. One small mound held a child's remains, along with his buckle and miniature spear. A man's grave included two belt buckles and a knife, and that of a woman contained a leather bag, a pin and a chatelaine.\nThe most impressive of the burials without a chamber is that of a young man who was buried with his horse, in Mound 17. The horse would have been sacrificed for the funeral, in a ritual sufficiently standardised to indicate a lack of sentimental attachment to it. Two undisturbed grave-hollows existed side-by-side under the mound. The man's oak coffin contained his pattern welded sword on his right and his sword-belt, wrapped around the blade, which had a bronze buckle with garnet cloisonné cellwork, two pyramidal strapmounts and a scabbard-buckle. By the man's head was a firesteel and a leather pouch, containing rough garnets and a piece of millefiori glass. Around the coffin were two spears, a shield, a small cauldron and a bronze bowl, a pot, an iron-bound bucket and some animal ribs. In the north-west corner of his grave was a bridle, mounted with circular gilt bronze plaques with interlace ornamentation. These items are on display at Sutton Hoo.\n\nInhumation graves of this kind are known from both England and Germanic continental Europe, with most dating from the 6th or early 7th century. In about 1820, an example was excavated at Witnesham. There are other examples at Lakenheath in western Suffolk and in the Snape cemetery: Other examples have been inferred from records of the discovery of horse furniture at Eye and Mildenhall.\n\nAlthough the grave under Mound 14 had been destroyed almost completely by robbing, apparently during a heavy rainstorm, it had contained exceptionally high-quality goods belonging to a woman. These included a chatelaine, a kidney-shaped purse-lid, a bowl, several buckles, a dress-fastener, and the hinges of a casket, all made of silver, and also a fragment of embroidered cloth.\n\nThis important grave, damaged by looters, was probably the source of the many iron ship-rivets found at Sutton Hoo in 1860. In 1938, when the mound was excavated, iron rivets were found, which enabled the Mound 2 grave to be interpreted as a small boat. Carver's re-investigation revealed that there was a rectangular plank-lined chamber, long by wide, sunk below the land surface, with the body and grave-goods laid out in it. A small ship had been placed over this in an east–west alignment, before a large earth mound was raised.\n\nChemical analysis of the chamber floor has suggested the presence of a body in the south-western corner. The goods found included fragments of a blue glass cup with a trailed decoration, similar to the recent find from the Prittlewell tomb in Essex. There were two gilt-bronze discs with animal interlace ornament, a bronze brooch, a silver buckle, and a gold-coated stud from a buckle. Four objects had a special kinship with the Mound 1 finds: the tip of a sword blade showed elaborate pattern welding; silver-gilt drinking horn-mounts (struck from the same dies as those in Mound 1); and the similarity of two fragments of dragon-like mounts or plaques. Although the rituals were not identical, the association of the contents of the grave shows a connection between the two burials.\n\nThe cemetery also contained bodies of people who had died violently, in some cases by hanging or decapitation. Often the bones had not survived, but the fleshy parts of the bodies had stained the sandy soil: the soil was laminated as work progressed, so that the emaciated figures of the dead could be revealed. Casts were taken of several of these.\n\nThe identification and discussion of these burials was led by Carver. Two main groups were excavated, with one arranged around Mound 5 and the other situated beyond the barrow cemetery limits in the field to the east. It is thought that a gallows once stood on Mound 5, in a prominent position near to a significant river-crossing point, and that the graves contained the bodies of criminals, possibly executed from the 8th and 9th centuries onwards.\n\nIn 2000, a Suffolk County Council team excavated the site intended for the National Trust's new visitor centre, north of Tranmer House, at a point where the ridge of the Deben valley veers westwards to form a promontory. When the topsoil was removed, early Anglo-Saxon burials were discovered in one corner, with some possessing high-status objects. The area had first attracted attention with the discovery of part of a 6th-century bronze vessel, of eastern Mediterranean origin, that had probably formed part of a furnished burial. The outer surface of the so-called \"Bromewell bucket\" was decorated with a Syrian- or Nubian-style frieze, depicting naked warriors in combat with leaping lions, and had an inscription in Greek that translated as \"Use this in good health, Master Count, for many happy years.\"\n\nIn an area near to a former rose garden, a group of moderate-sized burial mounds was identified. They had long since been levelled, but their position was shown by circular ditches that each enclosed a small deposit indicating the presence of a single burial, probably of unurned human ashes. One burial lay in an irregular oval pit that contained two vessels, a stamped black earthenware urn of late 6th-century type, and a well-preserved large bronze hanging bowl, with openwork hook escutcheons and a related circular mount at the centre. In another burial, a man had been laid next to his spear and covered with a shield of normal size. The shield bore an ornamented boss-stud and two fine metal mounts, ornamented with a predatory bird and a dragon-like creature. \n\nThe ship-burial discovered under Mound 1 in 1939 contained one of the most magnificent archaeological finds in England for its size and completeness, far-reaching connections, the quality and beauty of its contents, and for the profound interest it generated.\n\nAlthough practically none of the original timber survived, the form of the ship was perfectly preserved. Stains in the sand had replaced the wood but had preserved many construction details. Nearly all of the iron planking rivets were in their original places. It was possible to survey the original ship, which was found to be long, pointed at either end with tall rising stem and stern posts and widening to in the beam amidships with an inboard depth of over the keel line. From the keel board, the hull was constructed clinker-fashion with nine planks on either side, fastened with rivets. Twenty-six wooden frames strengthened the form. Repairs were visible: this had been a seagoing vessel of excellent craftsmanship, but there was no descending keel. The decking, benches and mast were removed. In the fore and aft sections, there were thorn-shaped oar-rests along the gunwales, indicating that there may have been positions for forty oarsmen. The central chamber had timber walls at either end and a roof, which was probably pitched.\n\nThe heavy oak vessel had been hauled from the river up the hill and lowered into a prepared trench, so only the tops of the stem and stern posts rose above the land surface. After the addition of the body and the artefacts, an oval mound was constructed, which covered the ship and rose above the horizon at the riverward side of the cemetery. The view to the river is now obscured by Top Hat Wood, but the mound would have been a visible symbol of power to those using the waterway. This appears to have been the final occasion upon which the Sutton Hoo cemetery was used for its original purpose.\n\nLong afterwards, the roof collapsed violently under the weight of the mound, compressing the ship's contents into a seam of earth.\n\nAs a body was not found, there was early speculation that the ship-burial was a cenotaph, but soil analyses conducted in 1967 found phosphate traces, supporting the view that a body had disappeared in the acidic soil. The presence of a platform (or a large coffin) that was about long was indicated. An iron-bound wooden bucket, an iron lamp containing beeswax, and a bottle of north continental manufacture were close by. The objects around the body indicate that it lay with the head at the west end of the wooden structure.\n\nArtefacts near the body have been identified as regalia, pointing to its being that of a king. Most of the suggestions for the occupant are East Anglian kings because of the proximity of the royal vill of Rendlesham. Since 1940, when H.M. Chadwick first ventured that the ship-burial was probably the grave of Rædwald, scholarly opinion divided between Raedwald and his son (or step-son) Sigeberht. The man who was buried under Mound 1 cannot be identified, but the identification with Rædwald still has widespread scholarly acceptance. But from time to time, other identifications are suggested, including his son Eorpwald of East Anglia, who succeeded his father in about 624. Rædwald is the most likely of the candidates because of the high quality of the imported and commissioned materials and the resources needed to assemble them, the authority that the gold was intended to convey, the community involvement required to conduct the ritual at a cemetery reserved for an elite, the close proximity of Sutton Hoo to Rendlesham and the probable date horizons.\n\nDavid M. Wilson has remarked that the metal artworks found in the Sutton Hoo graves were \"work of the highest quality, not only in English but in European terms\".\n\nSutton Hoo is a cornerstone of the study of art in Britain in the 6th–9th centuries. George Henderson has described the ship treasures as \"the first proven hothouse for the incubation of the Insular style\". The gold and garnet fittings show the creative fusion of earlier techniques and motifs by a master goldsmith. Insular art drew upon Irish, Pictish, Anglo-Saxon, native British and Mediterranean artistic sources: the 7th-century Book of Durrow owes as much to Pictish sculpture, British millefiori and enamelwork and Anglo-Saxon cloisonné metalwork as it does to Irish art. The Sutton Hoo treasures represent a continuum from pre-Christian royal accumulation of precious objects from diverse cultural sources, through to the art of gospel books, shrines and liturgical or dynastic objects.\n\nOn the head's left side was placed a \"crested\" and masked helmet wrapped in cloths. With its panels of tinned bronze and assembled mounts, the decoration is directly comparable to that found on helmets from the Vendel and Valsgärde cemeteries of eastern Sweden. The Sutton Hoo helmet differs from the Swedish examples in having an iron skull of a single vaulted shell and has a full face mask, a solid neck guard and deep cheekpieces. These features have been used to suggest an English origin for the helmet's basic structure; the deep cheekpieces have parallels in the Coppergate helmet, found in York. Although outwardly very like the Swedish examples, the Sutton Hoo helmet is a product of better craftsmanship. Helmets are extremely rare finds. No other such figural plaques were known in England, apart from a fragment from a burial at Caenby, Lincolnshire, until the 2009 discovery of the Staffordshire hoard, which contained many. The helmet rusted in the grave and was shattered into hundreds of tiny fragments when the chamber roof collapsed. Restoration of the helmet thus involved the meticulous identification, grouping and orientation of the surviving fragments before it could be reconstructed.\n\nTo the head's right was placed inverted a nested set of ten silver bowls, probably made in the Eastern Empire during the sixth century. Beneath them were two silver spoons, possibly from Byzantium, of a type bearing names of the Apostles. One spoon is marked in original nielloed Greek lettering with the name of PAULOS, \"Paul\". The other, matching spoon had been modified using lettering conventions of a Frankish coin-die cutter, to read SAULOS, \"Saul\". One theory suggests that the spoons (and possibly also the bowls) were a baptismal gift for the buried person.\n\nOn the right of the \"body\" lay a set of spears, tips uppermost, including three barbed angons, with their heads thrust through a handle of the bronze bowl. Nearby was a wand with a small mount depicting a wolf. Closer to the body lay the sword with a gold and garnet cloisonné pommel long, its pattern welded blade still within its scabbard, with superlative scabbard-bosses of domed cellwork and pyramidal mounts. Attached to this and lying toward the body was the sword harness and belt, fitted with a suite of gold mounts and strap-distributors of extremely intricate garnet cellwork ornament.\n\nTogether with the sword harness and scabbard mounts, the gold and garnet objects found in the upper body space, which form a co-ordinated ensemble, are among the true wonders of Sutton Hoo. Their artistic and technical quality is quite exceptional.\n\nThe \"great\" gold buckle is made in three parts. The plate is a long ovoid of a meandering but symmetrical outline with densely interwoven and interpenetrating ribbon animals rendered in chip-carving on the front. The gold surfaces are punched to receive niello detail. The plate is hollow and has a hinged back, forming a secret chamber, possibly for a relic. Both the tongue-plate and hoop are solid, ornamented, and expertly engineered.\nEach shoulder-clasp consists of two matching curved halves, hinged upon a long removable chained pin. The surfaces display panels of interlocking stepped garnets and chequer millefiori insets, surrounded by interlaced ornament of Germanic Style II ribbon animals. The half-round clasp ends contain garnet-work of interlocking wild boars with filigree surrounds. On the underside of the mounts are lugs for attachment to a stiff leather cuirass. The function of the clasps is to hold together the two halves of such armour so that it can fit the torso closely in the Roman manner. The cuirass itself, possibly worn in the grave, did not survive. No other Anglo-Saxon cuirass clasps are known.\n\nThe ornamental purse-lid, covering a lost leather pouch, hung from the waist-belt. The lid consists of a kidney-shaped cellwork frame enclosing a sheet of horn, on which were mounted pairs of exquisite garnet cellwork plaques depicting birds, wolves devouring men (or the ancient motif of the Master of Animals), geometric motifs and a double panel showing animals with interlaced extremities. The maker derived these images from the ornament of the Swedish-style helmets and shield-mounts. In his work they are transferred into the cellwork medium with dazzling technical and artistic virtuosity.\n\nThese are the work of a master-goldsmith who had access to an East Anglian armoury containing the objects used as pattern sources. As an ensemble they enabled the patron to appear imperial.\nThe purse contained thirty-seven gold shillings or , each originating from a different Frankish mint. They were deliberately collected. There were also three blank coins and two small ingots. This has prompted various explanations: possibly like the Roman \"obolus\" they may have been left to pay the forty ghostly oarsmen in the afterworld, or were a funeral tribute, or an expression of allegiance. They provide the primary evidence for the date of the burial, which was debatably in the third decade of the 7th century.\n\nIn the area corresponding to the lower legs of the body were laid out various drinking vessels, including a pair of drinking horns made from the horns of an aurochs, extinct since early mediaeval times. These have matching die-stamped gilt rim mounts and vandykes, of similar workmanship and design to the shield mounts, and exactly similar to the surviving horn vandykes from Mound 2. In the same area stood a set of maplewood cups with similar rim-mounts and vandykes, and a heap of folded textiles lay on the left side.\n\nA large quantity of material including metal objects and textiles was formed into two folded or packed heaps on the east end of the central wooden structure. This included the extremely rare survival of a long coat of ring-mail, made of alternate rows of welded and riveted iron links, two hanging bowls, leather shoes, a cushion stuffed with feathers, folded objects of leather and a wooden platter. At one side of the heaps lay an iron hammer-axe with a long iron handle, possibly a weapon.\n\nOn top of the folded heaps was set a fluted silver dish with drop handles, probably made in Italy, with the relief image of a female head in late Roman style worked into the bowl. This contained a series of small burr-wood cups with rim-mounts, combs of antler, small metal knives, a small silver bowl, and various other small effects (possibly toilet equipment), and including a bone gaming-piece, thought to be the 'king piece' from a set. (Traces of bone above the head position have suggested that a gaming-board was possibly set out, as at Taplow.) Above these was a silver ladle with gilt chevron ornament, also of Mediterranean origin.\n\nOver the whole of this, perched on top of the heaps, or their container, if there was one, lay a very large round silver platter with chased ornament, made in the Eastern Empire circa 500 and bearing the control stamps of Emperor Anastasius I (491–518). On this plate was deposited a piece of unburnt bone of uncertain derivation. The assemblage of Mediterranean silverware in the Sutton Hoo grave is unique for this period in Britain and Europe.\n\nAlong the inner west wall (i.e. the head end) at the north-west corner stood a tall iron stand with a grid near the top. Beside this rested a very large circular shield, with a central boss, mounted with garnets and with die-pressed plaques of interlaced animal ornament. The shield front displayed two large emblems with garnet settings, one a composite metal predatory bird and the other a flying dragon. It also bore animal-ornamented sheet strips directly die-linked to examples from the early cemetery at Vendel near Old Uppsala in Sweden. A small bell, possibly for an animal, lay nearby.\n\nAlong the wall was a long square-sectioned whetstone, tapered at either end and carved with human faces on each side. A ring mount, topped by a bronze antlered stag figurine, was fixed to the upper end, possibly made to resemble a late Roman consular sceptre. The purpose of the sceptre has generated considerable debate and a number of theories, some of which point to the potential religious significance of the stag. South of the septre was an iron-bound wooden bucket, one of several in the grave.\n\nIn the south-west corner was a group of objects which may have been hung up, but when discovered, were compressed together. They included a Coptic or eastern Mediterranean bronze bowl with drop handles and figures of animals, found below a badly deformed six-stringed Anglo-Saxon lyre in a beaver-skin bag, of a Germanic type found in wealthy Anglo-Saxon and north European graves of this date. Uppermost was a large and exceptionally elaborate three-hooked hanging bowl of Insular production, with champleve enamel and millefiori mounts showing fine-line spiral ornament and red cross motifs and with an enamelled metal fish mounted to swivel on a pin within the bowl.\nAt the east end of the chamber, near the north corner, stood an iron-bound tub of yew containing a smaller bucket. To the south were two small bronze cauldrons, which were probably hung against the wall. A large carinated bronze cauldron, similar to the example from a chamber-grave at Taplow, with iron mounts and two ring-handles was hung by one handle. Nearby lay an iron chain almost long, of complex ornamental sections and wrought links, for suspending a cauldron from the beams of a large hall. The chain was the product of a British tradition dating back to pre-Roman times. All these items were of a domestic character.\n\nThe burial chamber was evidently rich in textiles, represented by many fragments preserved, or by chemicals formed by corrosion. They included quantities of twill, possibly from cloaks, blankets or hangings, and the remains of cloaks with characteristic long-pile weaving. There appear to have been more exotic coloured hangings or spreads, including some (possibly imported) woven in stepped lozenge patterns using a Syrian technique in which the weft is looped around the warp to create a textured surface. Two other colour-patterned textiles, near the head and foot of the body area, resemble Scandinavian work of the same period.\n\nA series of excavations in 1881–83 by Hjalmar Stolpe revealed 14 graves in the village of Vendel in eastern Sweden. Several of the burials were contained in boats up to long and were furnished with swords, shields, helmets and other items. Beginning in 1928, another gravefield containing princely burials was excavated at Valsgärde. The pagan custom of furnished burial may have reached a natural culmination as Christianity began to make its mark. The Vendel and Valsgärde graves also included ships, similar artefact groups, and many sacrificed animals. Ship-burials for this period are largely confined to eastern Sweden and East Anglia. The earlier mound-burials at Old Uppsala, in the same region, have a more direct bearing on the \"Beowulf\" story, but do not contain ship-burials. The famous Gokstad and Oseberg ship-burials of Norway are of a later date.\n\nThe inclusion of drinking-horns, lyre, sword and shield, bronze and glass vessels is typical of high-status chamber-graves in England. The similar selection and arrangement of the goods in these graves indicates a conformity of household possessions and funeral customs between people of this status, with the Sutton Hoo ship-burial being a uniquely elaborated version, of exceptional quality. Unusually, Sutton Hoo included regalia and instruments of power and had direct Scandinavian connections. A possible explanation for such connections lies in the well-attested northern custom by which the children of leading men were often raised away from home by a distinguished friend or relative. A future East Anglian king, whilst being fostered in Sweden, could have acquired high quality objects and made contact with armourers, before returning to East Anglia to rule.\n\nCarver argues that pagan East Anglian rulers would have responded to the growing encroachment of Roman Christendom by employing ever more elaborate cremation rituals, so expressing defiance and independence. The execution victims, if not sacrificed for the ship-burial, perhaps suffered for their dissent from the cult of Christian royalty: their executions may coincide in date with the period of Mercian hegemony over East Anglia in about 760–825.\n\n\"Beowulf\", the Old English epic poem set in Denmark and Sweden (mostly Götaland) during the first half of the 6th century, opens with the funeral of great Danish king, Skjöldr (a.k.a. Scyld Scefing or Shield Sheafson), in a ship laden with treasure and has other descriptions of hoards, including Beowulf's own mound-burial. Its picture of warrior life in the hall of the Danish Scylding clan, with formal mead-drinking, minstrel recitation to the lyre and the rewarding of valour with gifts, and the description of a helmet, could all be illustrated from the Sutton Hoo finds. The interpretation of each has a bearing on the other, and the east Sweden connections with the Sutton Hoo material reinforce this link.\n\nSam Newton draws together the Sutton Hoo and \"Beowulf\" links with the Raedwald identification. Using genealogical data, he argues that the Wuffing dynasty derived from the Geatish house of Wulfing, mentioned in both \"Beowulf\" and the poem \"Widsith\". Possibly the oral materials from which \"Beowulf\" was assembled belonged to East Anglian royal tradition, and they and the ship-burial took shape together as heroic restatements of migration-age origins.\n\nChristopher Brooke in \"The Saxon & Norman Kings\" [1963] - chapter III - gives copious notes regarding \"Beowulf\" and the Sutton Hoo treasure and relates the life of the chiefs in the literary work with the 1939 discovery of the ship-burial.\n\nIn medieval times the westerly end of the mound was dug away and a boundary ditch was laid out. Therefore, when looters dug into the apparent centre during the sixteenth century, they missed the real centre: nor could they have foreseen that the deposit lay very deep in the belly of a buried ship, well below the level of the land surface.\n\nIn the 16th century, a pit, dated by bottle shards left at the bottom, was dug into Mound 1, narrowly missing the burial. The area was explored extensively during the 19th century, when a small viewing platform was constructed, but no useful records were made. In 1860 it was reported that nearly two bushels of iron screw bolts, presumably ship rivets, had been found at the recent opening of a mound and that it was hoped to open others.\n\nIn 1910, a mansion with fifteen bedrooms was built a short distance from the mounds and in 1926 the mansion and its arable land was purchased by Colonel Frank Pretty, a retired military officer who had recently married. In 1934, Pretty died, leaving a widow, Edith Pretty, and young son, Robert Dempster Pretty. Following her bereavement, Mrs Pretty became interested in Spiritualism, a religion that placed belief in the idea that the spirits of the deceased could be contacted.\n\nMrs Pretty in 1937 decided to organise an excavation of the mounds. Through the Ipswich Museum, she obtained the services of Basil Brown, a self-taught Suffolk archaeologist who had taken up full-time investigations of Roman sites for the museum. In June 1938, Pretty took him to the site, offered him accommodation and a wage of 30 shillings a week, and suggested that he start digging at Mound 1. Because it had been disturbed by earlier grave diggers, Brown, in consultation with the Ipswich Museum, decided instead to open three smaller mounds (2, 3 and 4). These only revealed fragmented artefacts, as the mounds had been robbed of valuable items. In Mound 2 he found iron ship-rivets and a disturbed chamber burial that contained unusual fragments of metal and glass artefacts. At first it was undecided as to whether they were Early Anglo-Saxon or Viking objects. The Ipswich Museum then became involved with the excavations: all the finds became part of the museum's collection.\n\nIn May 1939, Brown began work on Mound 1, helped by Pretty's gardener John (Jack) Jacobs, her gamekeeper William Spooner and another estate worker Bert Fuller. (Jacobs lived with his wife and their three children at Sutton Hoo House.) They drove a trench from the east end and on the third day discovered an iron rivet which Brown identified as a ship's rivet. Within hours others were found still in position. The colossal size of the find became apparent. After several weeks of patiently removing earth from the ship's hull, they reached the burial chamber.\nThe following month, Charles Phillips of Cambridge University heard rumours of a ship discovery. He was taken to Sutton Hoo by Mr Maynard, the Ipswich Museum curator, and was staggered by what he saw. Within a short time, following discussions with the Ipswich Museum, the British Museum, the Science Museum, and Office of Works, Phillips had taken over responsibility for the excavation of the burial chamber. Initially, Phillips and the British Museum instructed Brown to cease excavating until they could get their team assembled, but he continued working, something which may have saved the site from being looted by treasure hunters. Phillips' team included W.F. Grimes and O.G.S. Crawford of the Ordnance Survey, Peggy and Stuart Piggott, and other friends and colleagues. Extensive photography of the ship excavation was made by Mercie Lack and Barbara Wagstaff.\n\nThe need for secrecy and various vested interests led to confrontation between Phillips and the Ipswich Museum. In 1935–6 Phillips and his friend Grahame Clark had taken control of the society. The curator, Mr Maynard then turned his attention to developing Brown's work for the museum. Phillips, who was hostile toward the museum's honorary president, Reid Moir, F.R.S., had now reappeared, and he deliberately excluded Moir and Maynard from the new discovery at Sutton Hoo. After Ipswich Museum prematurely announced the discovery, reporters attempted to access the site, so Mrs Pretty paid for two policemen to guard the site 24 hours a day.\n\nThe finds, having been packed and removed to London, were brought back for a treasure trove inquest held that autumn at Sutton village hall, where it was decided that since the treasure was buried without the intention to recover it, it was the property of Mrs Pretty as landowner. Pretty decided to bequeath the treasure as a gift to the nation, so that the meaning and excitement of her discovery could be shared by everyone.\n\nWhen World War II broke out in September 1939, the grave-goods were put in storage. Sutton Hoo was used as a training ground for military vehicles. Phillips and colleagues produced important publications in 1940.\n\nFollowing Britain's victory in 1945, the Sutton Hoo artefacts were removed from storage. A team, led by Rupert Bruce-Mitford, from the British Museum's Department of British and Medieval Antiquities, determined their nature and helped to reconstruct and replicate the sceptre and helmet. They also oversaw the conservation of the artefacts, to protect them and enable them to be viewed by the public.\n\nFrom analysing the data collected in 1938-39, Bruce-Mitford concluded that there were still unanswered questions. As a result of his interest in excavating previously unexplored areas of the Sutton Hoo site, a second archaeological investigation was organised. In 1965, a British Museum team began work, continuing until 1971. The ship impression was re-exposed and found to have suffered some damage, not having been back-filled after excavation in 1939. Nevertheless, it remained sufficiently intact for a plaster cast to be taken and a fiberglass shape produced. The decision was then made to destroy the impression in order to excavate underneath. The mound was later restored to its pre-1939 appearance. The team also determined the limits of Mound 5 and investigated evidence of prehistoric activity on the original land-surface. They scientifically analysed and reconstructed some of the finds.\n\nThe three volumes of Bruce-Mitford's definitive text, \"The Sutton Hoo Ship-Burial\", were published in 1975, 1978 and 1983.\n\nIn 1978 a committee was formed in order to mount a third, and even larger excavation at Sutton Hoo. Backed by the Society of Antiquaries of London, the committee proposed an investigation to be led by Philip Rahtz from the University of York and Rupert Bruce-Mitford, but the British Museum's reservations led to the committee deciding to collaborate with the Ashmolean Museum. The committee recognised that much had changed in archaeology since the early 1970s. The Conservatives' privatisation policies signalled a decrease in state support for such projects, whilst the emergence of post-processualism in archaeological theory moved many archaeologists toward focussing on concepts such as social change. The Ashmolean's involvement convinced the British Museum and the Society of Antiquaries to help fund the project. In 1982, Martin Carver from the University of York was appointed to run the excavation, with a research design aimed at exploring \"the politics, social organisation and ideology\" of Sutton Hoo. Despite opposition by those who considered that funds available could be better used for rescue archaeology, in 1983 the project went ahead.\n\nCarver believed in restoring the overgrown site, much of which was riddled with rabbit warrens. After the site was surveyed using new techniques, the topsoil was stripped across an area that included Mounds 2, 5, 6, 7, 17 and 18. A new map of soil patterns and intrusions was produced that showed that the mounds had been sited in relation to prehistoric and Roman enclosure patterns. Anglo-Saxon graves of execution victims were found which were determined to be younger than the primary mounds. Mound 2 was re-explored and afterwards rebuilt. Mound 17, a previously undisturbed burial, was found to contain a young man, his weapons and goods, and a separate grave for a horse. A substantial part of the gravefield was left unexcavated for the benefit of future investigators and as yet unknown scientific methods.\n\nThe ship-burial treasure was presented to the nation by the owner, Mrs Pretty, and was at the time the largest gift made to the British Museum by a living donor. The principal items are now permanently on display at the British Museum. A display of the original finds excavated in 1938 from Mounds 2, 3 and 4, and replicas of the most important items from Mound 1, can be seen at the Ipswich Museum.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Sutton Hoo site, including Sutton Hoo House, was given to the National Trust by the Trustees of the Annie Tranmer Trust. At Sutton Hoo's visitor centre and Exhibition Hall, the newly found hanging bowl and the Bromeswell Bucket, finds from the equestrian grave, and a recreation of the burial chamber and its contents can be seen.\n\nThe 2001 Visitor Centre was designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects for the National Trust. Their work included the overall planning of the estate, the design of an exhibition hall and visitor facilities, car parking and the restoration of the Edwardian house to provide additional facilities.\n\nThe £5m visitor centre was opened in March 2002 by Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney who had published a translation of \"Beowulf\".\n\n\n"}

Schmitt attacks the \"liberal-neutralist\" and \"utopian\" notions that politics can be removed of all warlike, agonistic energy, arguing conflict existed as embedded in existence itself, likewise constituting an ineradicable trait of anthropological human nature. Schmitt attempts to substantiate his ideas by referencing the declared \"anthropological pessimism\" of \"realistic\" Catholic (and Christian) theology. The anti-perfectibilist pessimism of Traditional Catholic theology Schmitt considers esoterically relevant to the inner ontological being of politics and political activity in the contemporary world, modern people subconsciously secularizing theological intellectual ideas and concerns. Schmitt criticizes political \"radicals\" as basically ignorant, deluded, pseudo-messianic in mentality, and oblivious to the stark, hard knowledge of unveiled human nature, its \"esse\", encoded in ancient theology, wherein Original Sin held central, axial place, intertwining his own ideas of meta-politics with a reformulated \"metaphysics of evil\".\n\n\"The Concept of the Political\" was first published in 1932 by Duncker & Humblot (Munich). It was an elaboration of a journal article of the same title, published in 1927. The 1932 version has significant, and controversial, revisions. However, it is likely that these revisions were made in response to the reaction of Leo Strauss.\n\n"}
{"id": "18690276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18690276", "title": "The Dance II", "text": "The Dance II\n\nThe Dance II by Henri Matisse is a triptych mural (15 ft high by 45 ft long) in the Barnes Foundation. It was created in 1932 at the request of Albert C. Barnes after he met Matisse in the United States. Barnes was an art enthusiast and long-time collector of Matisse's works, and agreed to pay Matisse a total of $30,000 for the mural, which was expected to take a year.\n\nThe mural was to be placed above three arches spanning the windows of the main hall of Barnes' gallery. In Nice, France, Matisse executed the mural on canvas provided by Barnes, as opposed to working on site. This was an unusual approach for such a work, but the patron had offered him complete artistic freedom, and working onsite would in any event have been impractical. \n\nFor Matisse, the project proved to be beset with difficulties, and would end up taking him two years, leaving him physically and emotionally drained. He was also profoundly disappointed to be told on installation that Barnes had no intention of exhibiting the work to the public.\n\nNevertheless, Matisse was delighted with the work itself. In a 1933 letter to his son, Matisse wrote about the installation at the Barnes Foundation: \"It has a splendour that one can't imagine unless one sees it -- because both the whole ceiling and its arched vaults come alive through radiation and the main effect continues right down to the floor...I am profoundly tired but very pleased. When I saw the canvas put in place, it was detached from me and became part of the building.\"\n\nSome commentators consider that \"The Dance II\" mural was pivotal in enabling Matisse to return to the most essential sources of his art. For Matisse, the work highlighted aspects such as simplicity, flattening, the emphasis on colour and the use of paper cut-outs which would all go on to play an important role in his later artistic development.\n\nDuring a 1993 hearing in the Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Orphan's Court art conservator Paul R. Himmelstein argued that \"The Dance II\" suffered significant damages during a controversial world tour of highlights from the Barnes Foundation's collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings. \n\n"}

The theatre seats 11,000 people with approximately 1,500 free seats in the last nine rows that are available on a first come, first served basis.\nThe Muny seasons run every year from mid-June to mid-August. It is run by a nonprofit organization. The current president and chief executive is Dennis M. Reagan. The current artistic director & executive producer is Mike Isaacson.\n\nIn 1914, Luther Ely Smith began staging pageant-masques on Art Hill in Forest Park. In 1916, a grassy area between two oak trees on the present site of The Muny was chosen for a production of \"As You Like It\" produced by Margaret Anglin and starring Sydney Greenstreet with a local cast of \"1,000 St. Louis folk dancers and folk singers.\"\n\nSoon after, the Convention Board of the St. Louis Advertising Club was looking for an entertainment feature for its thirteenth annual convention, which was to take place June 3, 1917. Mayor Henry Kiel, attorney Guy Golterman, and Parks Commissioner Nelson Cunliff stepped in and, in forty-nine days (not counting seven lost to rain), created the first municipally owned outdoor theatre in the United States. On June 5, 1917, the opera \"Aida\" was presented on what would become the Muny stage.\n\nIn 1919, the new theatre received a name: St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre, or \"The Muny\" for short. The first show under the Muny banner was \"Robin Hood\", which opened on June 16, 1919, and featured Mayor Kiel as King Richard. Concerts were performed here prior to the opening of Riverport Amphitheatre in 1991.\nIn 1930, the stage was equipped with a turntable for performance purposes. It was reconstructed in 1997 due to dilapidation. In 1994, The Muny's Board of Directors founded the Muny Kids, a select group of performers between the ages of 7 to 13 who traveled around St. Louis performing, and in the summer gave preview shows prior to the production. In 1998, the Muny Teens group was formed for the same purpose, featuring teen performers between the ages of 14 to 18.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of the Muny in 2005-2006 was William H. T. Bush (younger brother of former President George H. W. Bush). The current Chairman of the Board is Stephen C. Jones.\n\n\n\nFor a complete listing of all productions since the first season in 1919, see List of The Muny repertory.\n\nThe Muny produces all of its musicals (typically seven) in the season and operates only in the summer. During the winter, a full-time staff of fewer than twenty people prepare for the next summer season. During the season itself, the summer staff expands to include more than 500 people in various positions. All shows are rehearsed within the course of eleven days, with two technical rehearsals (one costumed, one not) being held in the two to three days before the show's opening. Shows run from Monday to Sunday, although there have been exceptions to this, particularly in recent years, when each season has had at least one production with an extended run.\n\nThe Muny website claims it is the \"nation's oldest and largest outdoor musical theatre.\" There are numerous amphitheatres/outdoor theatres that have a larger capacity area; however, The Muny houses the largest number of seats. There is no lawn seating inside The Muny. In addition, The Muny is the largest to host only Broadway-style musical theatre.\n\nThe next largest seat capacity theatre in the United States is the San Manuel Amphitheater in California, housing 10,900 seats.\n\nFor a list of other amphitheatres see: List of contemporary amphitheatres.\n\nSince its beginning, The Muny has featured hundreds of big names in theatre, television and film on its stage, drawing inevitably huge crowds.\n\nA history of the celebrities who have performed at The Muny, including a cast listing, can be found on The Muny's website.\n\nDuring one of the last productions each summer season, survey forms are handed out to audience members. On this survey, audience members are asked to select their top seven choices from a long list of show titles. The choices change each year, depending on which titles are available and what shows have not been produced for a number of years. The survey results contribute to (though are just one of many determining factors in deciding) show choices for upcoming seasons. In the past, The Muny chiefly operated on a five-year cycle in which a title could not be produced again until five seasons had passed. Over the past two decades, \"Fiddler on the Roof\", \"Annie\", \"My Fair Lady\", \"42nd Street\", \"West Side Story\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" have been the most popular titles, each receiving four productions since 1990. The 2012 Muny season was announced in October 2011, a significant shift from the typical Muny practice of officially announcing the upcoming summer season in the preceding January or February of the same year.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "70798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70798", "title": "Valkyrie", "text": "Valkyrie\n\nIn Norse mythology, a valkyrie (; from Old Norse \"chooser of the slain\") is one of a host of female figures who choose those who may die in battle and those who may live. Selecting among half of those who die in battle (the other half go to the goddess Freyja's afterlife field ), the valkyries bring their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain, Valhalla, ruled over by the god Odin. There, the deceased warriors become (Old Norse \"single (or once) fighters\"). When the are not preparing for the events of Ragnarök, the valkyries bear them mead. Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals, where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty, sometimes accompanied by ravens and sometimes connected to swans or horses.\n\nValkyries are attested in the \"Poetic Edda\" (a book of poems compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources), the \"Prose Edda\", the (both by Snorri Sturluson) and the (one of the Sagas of Icelanders), all written—or compiled—in the 13th century. They appear throughout the poetry of skalds, in a 14th-century charm, and in various runic inscriptions.\n\nThe Old English cognate terms and appear in several Old English manuscripts, and scholars have explored whether the terms appear in Old English by way of Norse influence, or reflect a tradition also native among the Anglo-Saxon pagans. Scholarly theories have been proposed about the relation between the valkyries, the Norns, and the , all of which are supernatural figures associated with fate. Archaeological excavations throughout Scandinavia have uncovered amulets theorized as depicting valkyries. In modern culture, valkyries have been the subject of works of art, musical works, comic books, video games and poetry.\n\nThe word \"valkyrie\" derives from Old Norse ' (plural ), which is composed of two words: the noun ' (referring to the slain on the battlefield) and the verb ' (meaning \"to choose\"). Together, they mean 'chooser of the slain'. The Old Norse is cognate to Old English '. From the Old English and Old Norse forms, philologist Vladimir Orel reconstructs the Proto-Germanic form . However, the term may have been borrowed into Old English from Old Norse: see discussion in the Old English attestations section below.\n\nOther terms for valkyries in Old Norse sources include (\"wish maid\"), appearing in the poem and (\"Odin's maids\"), appearing in the . may be related to the Odinic name (roughly meaning \"wish fulfiller\"), referring to the fact that Odin receives slain warriors in Valhalla.\n\nValkyries are mentioned or appear in the \"Poetic Edda\" poems \"Völuspá\", \"Grímnismál\", \"Völundarkviða\", \"Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar\", \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana I\", \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana II\" and \"Sigrdrífumál\".\n\nIn stanza 30 of the poem \"Völuspá\", a völva (a travelling seeress in Norse society) tells Odin that \"she saw\" valkyries coming from far away who are ready to ride to \"the realm of the gods\". The völva follows this with a list of six valkyries: Skuld (Old Norse, possibly \"debt\" or \"future\") who \"bore a shield\", Skögul (\"shaker\"), Gunnr (\"war\"), Hildr (\"battle\"), Göndul (\"wand-wielder\") and Geirskögul (\"Spear-Skögul\"). Afterwards, the völva tells him she has listed the \"ladies of the War Lord, ready to ride, valkyries, over the earth\".\n\nIn the poem \"Grímnismál\", Odin (disguised as \"Grímnir\"), tortured, starved and thirsty, tells the young Agnar that he wishes that the valkyries Hrist (\"shaker\") and Mist (\"cloud\") would \"bear him a [drinking] horn\", then provides a list of 11 more valkyries who he says \"bear ale to the einherjar\"; Skeggjöld (\"axe-age\"), Skögul, Hildr, Þrúðr (\"power\"), Hlökk (\"noise\", or \"battle\"), Herfjötur (\"host-fetter\"), Göll (\"tumult\"), Geirahöð (\"spear-fight\"), Randgríð (\"shield-truce\"), Ráðgríð (\"council-truce\") and Reginleif (\"power-truce\").\n\nA prose introduction in the poem \"Völundarkviða\" relates that the brothers Slagfiðr, Egil and Völund dwelt in a house sited in a location called Úlfdalir (\"wolf dales\"). There, early one morning, the brothers find three women spinning linen on the shore of the lake Úlfsjár (\"wolf lake\"), and \"near them were their swan's garments; they were valkyries\". Two daughters of King Hlödvér are named Hlaðguðr svanhvít (\"swan-white\") and Hervör alvitr (possibly meaning \"all-wise\" or \"strange creature\"); the third, daughter of Kjárr of Valland, is named Ölrún (possibly meaning \"beer rune\"). The brothers take the three women back to their hall with them—Egil takes Ölrún, Slagfiðr takes Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund takes Hervör alvitr. They live together for seven winters, until the women fly off to go to a battle and do not return. Egil goes off in snow-shoes to look for Ölrún, Slagfiðr goes searching for Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund sits in Úlfdalir.\n\nIn the poem \"Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar\", a prose narrative says that an unnamed and silent young man, the son of the Norwegian King Hjörvarðr and Sigrlinn of Sváfaland, witnesses nine valkyries riding by while sitting atop a burial mound. He finds one particularly striking; this valkyrie is detailed later in a prose narrative as Sváva, King Eylimi's daughter, who \"often protected him in battles\". The valkyrie speaks to the unnamed man, and gives him the name \"Helgi\" (meaning \"the holy one\"). The previously silent Helgi speaks; he refers to the valkyrie as \"bright-face lady\", and asks her what gift he will receive with the name she has bestowed upon him, but he will not accept it if he cannot have her as well. The valkyrie tells him she knows of a hoard of swords in Sigarsholm, and that one of them is of particular importance, which she describes in detail. Further into the poem, Atli flytes with the female jötunn Hrímgerðr. While flyting with Atli, Hrímgerðr says that she had seen 27 valkyries around Helgi, yet one particularly fair valkyrie led the band:\n\nAfter Hrímgerðr is turned to stone by the daylight, a prose narrative continues that Helgi, who is now king, goes to Sváva's father—King Eylimi—and asks for his daughter. Helgi and Sváva are betrothed and love one another dearly. Sváva stays at home with King Eylimi, and Helgi goes raiding, and to this the narrative adds that Sváva \"was a valkyrie just as before\". The poem continues, and, among various other events, Helgi dies from a wound received in battle. A narrative at the end of the poem says that Helgi and his valkyrie wife Sváva \"are said to be reincarnated\".\n\nIn the poem \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana I\", the hero Helgi Hundingsbane sits in the corpse-strewn battlefield of Logafjöll. A light shines from the fell, and from that light strike bolts of lightning. Flying through the sky, helmeted valkyries appear. Their waist-length mail armour is drenched in blood; their spears shine brightly:\n\nIn the stanza that follows, Helgi asks the valkyries (who he refers to as \"southern goddesses\") if they would like to come home with the warriors when night falls (all the while arrows were flying). The battle over, the valkyrie Sigrún (\"victory-rune\"), informs him from her horse that her father Högni has betrothed her to Höðbroddr, the son of king Granmar of the Hniflung clan, who Sigrún deems unworthy. Helgi assembles an immense host to ride to wage battle at Frekastein against the Hniflung clan to assist Sigrún in her plight to avoid her betrothment. Later in the poem, the hero Sinfjötli flyts with Guðmundr. Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been female, and gibes that Guðmundr was \"a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin's valkyries\", adding that all of the einherjar \"had to fight, headstrong woman, on your account\". Further in the poem, the phrase \"the valkyrie's airy sea\" is used for \"mist\".\n\nTowards the end of the poem, valkyries again descend from the sky, this time to protect Helgi amid the battle at Frekastein. After the battle, all the valkyries fly away but Sigrún and wolves (referred to as \"the troll-woman's mount\") consume corpses:\n\nThe battle won, Sigrún tells Helgi that he will become a great ruler and pledges herself to him.\n\nAt the beginning of the poem \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana II\", a prose narrative says that King Sigmund (son of Völsung) and his wife Borghild (of Brálund) have a son named Helgi, who they named for Helgi Hjörvarðsson (the antagonist of the earlier \"Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar\"). After Helgi has killed King Hunding in stanza 4, a prose narrative says that Helgi escapes, consumes the raw meat of cattle he has slaughtered on a beach, and encounters Sigrún. Sigrún, daughter of King Högni, is \"a valkyrie and rode through air and sea\", and she is the valkyrie Sváva reincarnated. In stanza 7, Sigrún uses the phrase \"fed the gosling of Gunn's sisters\". Gunnr and her sisters are valkyries, and these goslings are ravens, who feed on the corpses left on the battlefield by warriors.\n\nAfter stanza 18, a prose narrative relates that Helgi and his immense fleet of ships are heading to Frekastein, but encounter a great storm. Lightning strikes one of the ships. The fleet sees nine valkyries flying through the air, among whom they recognise Sigrún. The storm abates, and the fleets arrive safely at land. Helgi dies in battle, yet returns to visit Sigrún from Valhalla once in a burial mound, and at the end of the poem, a prose epilogue explains that Sigrún later dies of grief. The epilogue details that \"there was a belief in the pagan religion, which we now reckon [is] an old wives' tale, that people could be reincarnated\" and that \"Helgi and Sigrun were thought to have been reborn\" as another Helgi and valkyrie couple; Helgi as Helgi Haddingjaskaði and Sigrún as the daughter of Halfdan; the valkyrie Kára. The epilogue details that further information about the two can be found in the (now lost) work \"Káruljóð\".\n\nIn the prose introduction to the poem \"Sigrdrífumál\", the hero Sigurd rides up to Hindarfell and heads south towards \"the land of the Franks\". On the mountain Sigurd sees a great light, \"as if fire were burning, which blazed up to the sky\". Sigurd approaches it, and there he sees a \"skjaldborg\" with a banner flying overhead. Sigurd enters the \"skjaldborg\", and sees a warrior lying there—asleep and fully armed. Sigurd removes the helmet of the warrior, and sees the face of a woman. The woman's corslet is so tight that it seems to have grown into the woman's body. Sigurd uses his sword Gram to cut the corslet, starting from the neck of the corslet downwards, he continues cutting down her sleeves, and takes the corslet off of her.\n\nThe woman wakes, sits up, looks at Sigurd, and the two converse in two stanzas of verse. In the second stanza, the woman explains that Odin placed a sleeping spell on her she could not break, and due to that spell she has been asleep a long time. Sigurd asks for her name, and the woman gives Sigurd a horn of mead to help him retain her words in his memory. The woman recites a heathen prayer in two stanzas. A prose narrative explains that the woman is named Sigrdrífa and that she is a valkyrie.\n\nA narrative relates that Sigrdrífa explains to Sigurd that there were two kings fighting one another. Odin had promised one of these—Hjalmgunnar—victory in battle, yet she had \"brought down\" Hjalmgunnar in battle. Odin pricked her with a sleeping-thorn in consequence, told her she would never again \"fight victoriously in battle\", and condemned her to marriage. In response, Sigrdrífa told Odin she had sworn a great oath that she would never wed a man who knew fear. Sigurd asks Sigrdrífa to share with him her wisdom of all worlds. The poem continues in verse, where Sigrdrífa provides Sigurd with knowledge in inscribing runes, mystic wisdom, and prophecy.\n\nIn the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, valkyries are first mentioned in chapter 36 of the book \"Gylfaginning\", where the enthroned figure of High informs Gangleri (King Gylfi in disguise) of the activities of the valkyries and mentions a few goddesses. High says \"there are still others whose duty it is to serve in Valhalla. They bring drink and see to the table and the ale cups.\" Following this, High gives a stanza from the poem \"Grímnismál\" that contains a list of valkyries. High says \"these women are called valkyries, and they are sent by Odin to every battle, where they choose which men are to die and they determine who has victory\". High adds that Gunnr (\"war\"), Róta, and Skuld—the last of the three he refers to as \"the youngest norn\"—\"always ride to choose the slain and decide the outcome of battle\". In chapter 49, High describes that when Odin and his wife Frigg arrived at the funeral of their slain son Baldr, with them came the valkyries and also Odin's ravens.\n\nReferences to valkyries appear throughout the book \"Skáldskaparmál\", which provides information about skaldic poetry. In chapter 2, a quote is given from the work \"Húsdrápa\" by the 10th century skald Úlfr Uggason. In the poem, Úlfr describes mythological scenes depicted in a newly built hall, including valkyries and ravens accompanying Odin at Baldr's funeral feast:\n\nFurther in chapter 2, a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem \"Eiríksmál\" is provided (see the \"Fagrskinna\" section below for more detail about the poem and another translation):\n\nIn chapter 31, poetic terms for referring to a woman are given, including \"[a] woman is also referred to in terms of all Asyniur or valkyries or norns or \"dísir\"\". In chapter 41, while the hero Sigurd is riding his horse Grani, he encounters a building on a mountain. Within this building Sigurd finds a sleeping woman wearing a helmet and a coat of mail. Sigurd cuts the mail from her, and she awakes. She tells him her name is Hildr, and \"she is known as Brynhildr, and was a valkyrie\".\n\nIn chapter 48, poetic terms for \"battle\" include \"weather of weapons or shields, or of Odin or valkyrie or war-kings or their clash or noise\", followed by examples of compositions by various skalds that have used the name of valkyries in said manner (Þorbjörn Hornklofi uses \"Skögul's din\" for \"battlefield\", Bersi Skáldtorfuson uses \"Gunnr's fire\" for \"sword\" and \"Hlökk's snow\" for \"battle\", Einarr Skúlason uses \"Hildr's sail\" for \"shield\" and \"Göndul's crushing wind\" for \"battle\" and Einarr skálaglamm uses \"Göndul's din\"). Chapter 49 gives similar information when referring to weapons and armor (though the term \"death-maidens\"—Old Norse \"valmeyjar\"—instead of \"valkyries\" is used here), with further examples. In chapter 57, within a list of names of ásynjur (and after alternate names for the goddess Freyja are provided), a further section contains a list of \"Odin's maids\"; valkyries: Hildr, Göndul, Hlökk, Mist, Skögul. And then an additional four names; Hrund, Eir, Hrist and Skuld. The section adds that \"they are called norns who shape necessity\".\n\nSome manuscripts of the feature \"Nafnaþulur\" section of \"Skáldskaparmál\" contain an extended list of 29 valkyrie names (listed as the \"valkyries of Viðrir\"—a name of Odin). The first stanza lists: Hrist, Mist, Herja, Hlökk, Geiravör, Göll, Hjörþrimul, Guðr, Herfjötra, Skuld, Geirönul, Skögul and Randgníð. The second stanza lists: Ráðgríðr, Göndul, Svipul, Geirskögul, Hildr, Skeggöld, Hrund, Geirdriful, Randgríðr, Þrúðr, Reginleif, Sveið, Þögn, Hjalmþrimul, Þrima and Skalmöld.\n\nThe fragmentary skaldic poem \"Hrafnsmál\" (generally accepted as authored by 9th century Norwegian skald Þorbjörn Hornklofi) features a conversation between a valkyrie and a raven, largely consisting of the life and deeds of Harald I of Norway. The poem begins with a request for silence among noblemen so that the skald may tell the deeds of Harald Fairhair. The narrator states that they once overheard a \"high-minded\", \"golden-haired\" and \"white-armed\" maiden speaking with a \"glossy-beaked raven\". The valkyrie considers herself wise, understands the speech of birds, is further described as having a white-throat and sparkling eyes, and she takes no pleasure in men:\n\nThe valkyrie, previously described as fair and beautiful, then speaks to the gore-drenched and corpse-reeking raven:\n\nThe black raven shakes himself, and he responds that he and the rest of the ravens have followed Harald since hatching from their eggs. The raven expresses surprise that the valkyrie seems unfamiliar with the deeds of Harald, and tells her about his deeds for several stanzas. At stanza 15, a question and answer format begins where the valkyrie asks the raven a question regarding Harald, and the raven responds in turn. This continues until the poem ends abruptly.\n\nIn chapter 157 of \"Njáls saga\", a man named Dörruð witnesses 12 people riding together to a stone hut on Good Friday in Caithness. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, and that they have set up a particular loom; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are the warp and weft, a sword is the shuttle, and the reels are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called \"Darraðarljóð\", which Dörruð memorizes.\n\nThe song consists of 11 stanzas, and within it the valkyries weave and choose who is to be slain at the Battle of Clontarf (fought outside Dublin in 1014 CE). Of the 12 valkyries weaving, six have their names given in the song: Hildr, Hjörþrimul, Sanngriðr, Svipul, Guðr and Göndul. Stanza 9 of the song reads:\n\nAt the end of the poem, the valkyries sing \"start we swiftly with steeds unsaddled—hence to battle with brandished swords!\" The prose narrative picks up again, and says that the valkyries tear their loom down and into pieces. Each valkyrie holds on to what she has in her hands. Dörruð leaves the chink in the wall and heads home, and the women mount their horses and ride away; six to the south and six to the north.\n\nAt the end of the \"Heimskringla\" saga \"Hákonar saga góða\", the poem \"Hákonarmál\" by the 10th century skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir is presented. The saga relates that king Haakon I of Norway died in battle, and although he is Christian, he requests that since he has died \"among heathens, then give me such burial place as seems most fitting to you\". The saga relates that shortly after Haakon died on the same slab of rock that he was born upon, he was greatly mourned by friend and foe alike, and that his friends moved his body northward to Sæheim in North Hordaland. Haakon was buried there in a large burial mound in full armour and his finest clothing, yet with no other valuables. Further, \"words were spoken over his grave according to the custom of heathen men, and they put him on the way to Valhalla\". The poem \"Hákonarmál\" is then provided.\n\nIn \"Hákonarmál\", Odin sends forth the two valkyries Göndul and Skögul to \"choose among the kings' kinsmen\" and who in battle should dwell with Odin in Valhalla. A battle rages with great slaughter, and part of the description employs the kenning \"Skögul's-stormblast\" for \"battle\". Haakon and his men die in battle, and they see the valkyrie Göndul leaning on a spear shaft. Göndul comments that \"groweth now the gods' following, since Hákon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads\". Haakon hears \"what the valkyries said\", and the valkyries are described as sitting \"high-hearted on horseback\", wearing helmets, carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them. A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Skögul:\n\nSkögul says that they shall now ride forth to the \"green homes of the godheads\" to tell Odin the king will come to Valhalla. The poem continues, and Haakon becomes a part of the einherjar in Valhalla, awaiting to do battle with the monstrous wolf Fenrir.\n\nIn chapter 8 of \"Fagrskinna\", a prose narrative states that, after the death of her husband Eric Bloodaxe, Gunnhild Mother of Kings had a poem composed about him. The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as \"Eiríksmál\". It describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death. The poem begins with comments by Odin (as Old Norse \"Óðinn\"):\n\nThe god Bragi asks where a thundering sound is coming from, and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla—and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.\n\nA witchcraft trial held in 1324 in Bergen, Norway, records a spell used by the accused Ragnhild Tregagás to end the marriage of her former lover, a man named Bárd. The charm contains a mention of the valkyrie Göndul being \"sent out\":\n\nThe Old English and appear several times in Old English manuscripts, generally to translate foreign concepts into Old English. In the sermon , written by Wulfstan II, is used, and considered to appear as word for a human \"sorceress\". An early 11th-century manuscript of Aldhelm's (Oxford, Bodleian library, Digby 146) glosses with (with meaning \"goddess\"). is used to translate the names of the classical furies in two manuscripts (Cotton Cleopatra A. iii, and the older \"Corpus Glossary\"). In the manuscript Cotton Cleopatra A. iii, is also used to gloss the Roman goddess Bellona. A description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army appears as (meaning \"dark one choosing the slain\"). Scholarly theories debate whether these attestations point to an indigenous belief among the Anglo-Saxons shared with the Norse, or if they were a result of later Norse influence (see section below).\n\nViking Age stylized silver amulets depicting women wearing long gowns, their hair pulled back and knotted into a ponytail, sometimes bearing drinking horns, have been discovered throughout Scandinavia. These figures are commonly considered to represent valkyries or dísir. According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the amulets appear in Viking Age graves, and were presumably placed there because \"they were thought to have protective powers\".\n\nThe Tjängvide image stone from the Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden features a rider on an eight-legged horse, which may be Odin's eight-legged horse Sleipnir, being greeted by a female, which may be a valkyrie at Valhalla. The 11th century runestone U 1163 features a carving of a female bearing a horn that has been interpreted as the valkyrie Sigrdrífa handing the hero Sigurd (also depicted on the stone) a drinking horn.\n\nIn 2013, a small figure dated at around 800 AD was discovered in Hårby, Denmark by three amateur archaeologists. The figurine portrays a woman with long hair knotted into a ponytail who is wearing a long dress which is sleeveless and vest like at the top. Over the top of her dress she is wearing an embroidered apron. Her clothing keeps the woman's arms unobstructed so she can fight with the sword and shield she is holding. Commenting on the figure, archaeologist Mogens Bo Henriksen said that \"there can hardly be any doubt that the figure depicts one of Odin's valkyries as we know them from the sagas as well as from Swedish picture stones from the time around AD700\".\n\nSpecific valkyries are mentioned on two runestones; the early 9th century Rök Runestone in Östergötland, Sweden, and the 10th-century Karlevi Runestone on the island of Öland, Sweden, which mentions the valkyrie Þrúðr. On the Rök Runestone, a kenning is employed that involves a valkyrie riding a wolf as her steed:\n\nAmong the Bryggen inscriptions found in Bergen, Norway, is the \"valkyrie stick\" from the late 14th century. The stick features a runic inscription intended as a charm. The inscription says that \"I cut cure-runes\", and also \"help-runes\", once against elves, twice against trolls, thrice against thurs and then a mention of a valkyrie occurs:\n\nThis is followed by \"I send you, I look at you, wolfish perversion, and unbearable desire, may distress descend on you and \"jöluns\" wrath. Never shall you sit, never shall you sleep ... (that you) love me as yourself.\" According to Mindy MacLeod and Bernard Mees, the inscription \"seems to begin as a benevolent formulation before abruptly switching to the infliction of distress and misery, presumably upon the recipient of the charm rather than the baleful valkyrie\", and they posit the final line appears \"to constitute a rather spiteful kind of charm aimed at securing the love of a woman\".\n\nMacLeod and Mees state that the opening lines of the charm correspond to the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Sigrdrífumál\", where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa provides runic advice, and that the meaning of the term \"skag\" is unclear, but a cognate exists in \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana I\" where Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been a \"\"skass\"-valkyrie\". MacLeod and Mees believe the word means something like \"supernatural sending\", and that this points to a connection to the Ragnhild Tregagás charm, where a valkyrie is also \"sent forth\".\n\nThe Old Norse poems \"Völuspá\", \"Grímnismál\", \"Darraðarljóð\" and the \"Nafnaþulur\" section of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Skáldskaparmál\", provide lists of valkyrie names. In addition, some valkyrie names appear solely outside of these lists, such as \"Sigrún\" (who is attested in the poems \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana I\" and \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana II\"). Many valkyrie names emphasize associations with battle and, in many cases, on the spear—a weapon heavily associated with the god Odin. Some scholars propose that the names of the valkyries themselves contain no individuality, but are rather descriptive of the traits and nature of war-goddesses, and are possibly the descriptive creations of skalds.\n\nSome valkyrie names may be descriptive of the roles and abilities of the valkyries. The valkyrie name \"Herja\" has been theorised as pointing to a connection to the name of the goddess \"Hariasa\", who is attested from a stone from 187 CE. The name \"Herfjötur\" has been theorised as pointing to the ability of the valkyries to place fetters. The name \"Svipul\" may be descriptive of the influence the valkyries have over wyrd or ørlog—a Germanic concept of fate.\n\nRichard North says that the description of a raven flying over the Egyptian army (glossed as ) may have been directly influenced by the Old Norse concept of Valhalla, the usage of in may represent a loan or loan-translation of Old Norse , but the Cotton Cleopatra A. iii and the \"Corpus Glossary\" instances \"appear to show an Anglo-Saxon conception of that was independent of contemporary Scandinavian influence\".\n\nTwo Old English charms mention figures that are theorised as representing an Anglo-Saxon notion of valkyries or valkyrie-like female beings; , a charm to cure a sudden pain or stitch, and \"For a Swarm of Bees\", a charm to keep honey bees from swarming. In , a sudden pain is attributed to a small, \"shrieking\" spear thrown with supernatural strength () by \"fierce\" loudly flying \"mighty women\" () who have ridden over a burial mound:\n\n<poem>They were loud, yes, loud,\nwhen they rode over the (burial) mound;\nthey were fierce when they rode across the land.\nShield yourself now, you can survive this strife.\nOut, little spear, if there is one here within.\nIt stood under/behind lime-wood (i.e. a shield), under a light-coloured/light-weight shield,\nwhere those mighty women marshalled their powers, and they send shrieking spears.</poem>\n\nTheories have been proposed that these figures are connected to valkyries. Richard North says that \"though it is not clear what the poet takes these women to be, their female sex, riding in flight and throwing spears suggest that they were imagined in England as a female being analogous to the later Norse .\" Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes that was originally a battle spell that had, over time, been reduced to evoke \"a prosaic stitch in the side\". Towards the end of \"For a Swarm of Bees\", the swarming bees are referred to as \"victory-women\" (Old English ):\n\n<poem>Settle down, victory-women,\nnever be wild and fly to the woods.\nBe as mindful of my welfare,\nas is each man of eating and of home.</poem>\n\nThe term \"victory women\" has been theorised as pointing to an association with valkyries. This theory is not universally accepted, and the reference has also been theorised as a simple metaphor for the \"victorious sword\" (the stinging) of the bees.\n\nOne of the two Old High German Merseburg Incantations call upon female beings—\"Idisi\"—to bind and hamper an army. The incantation reads:\n\n<poem>Once the Idisi sat, sat here and there,\nsome bound fetters, some hampered the army,\nsome untied fetters:\nEscape from the fetters, flee from the enemies.</poem>\n\nThe \"Idisi\" mentioned in the incantation are generally considered to be valkyries. Rudolf Simek says that \"these Idisi are obviously a kind of valkyrie, as these also have the power to hamper enemies in Norse mythology\" and points to a connection with the valkyrie name (Old Norse \"army-fetter\"). Hilda R. Davidson compares the incantation to the Old English charm and theorises a similar role for them both.\n\nSimek says that the West Germanic term \"Idisi\" (, , ) refers to a \"dignified, well respected woman (married or unmarried), possibly a term for any woman, and therefore glosses exactly Latin \" and that a link to the North Germanic term is reasonable to assume, yet not undisputed. In addition, the place name Idisiaviso (meaning \"plain of the Idisi\") where forces commanded by Arminius fought those commanded by Germanicus at the Battle of the Weser River in 16 AD. Simek points to a connection between the name \"Idisiaviso\", the role of the Idisi in one of the two Merseburg Incantations and valkyries.\n\nRegarding the , Simek states that Old Norse appears commonly as simply a term for \"woman\", just as Old High German , Old Saxon and Old English , and may have also been used to denote a type of goddess. According to Simek, \"several of the Eddic sources might lead us to conclude that the were valkyrie-like guardians of the dead, and indeed in I 19 the valkyries are even called \"Odin's \". The are explicitly called dead women in 28 and a secondary belief that the were the souls of dead women (see ) also underlies the of Icelandic folklore. Simek says that \"as the function of the matrons was also extremely varied—fertility goddess, personal guardians, but also warrior-goddesses—the belief in the , like the belief in the valkyries, norns and matrons, may be considered to be different manifestations of a belief in a number of female (half-?) goddesses.\"\n\nJacob Grimm states that, though the norns and valkyries are similar in nature, there is a fundamental difference between the two. Grimm states that a can be both norn and a valkyrie, \"but their functions are separate and usually the persons. The norns have to pronounce the fatum [fate], they sit on their chairs, or they roam through the country among mortals, fastening their threads. Nowhere is it said that they ride. The valkyrs \"ride\" to war, decide the issues of fighting, and conduct the fallen to heaven; their riding is like that of heroes and gods\".\n\nVarious theories have been proposed about the origins and development of the valkyries from Germanic paganism to later Norse mythology. Rudolf Simek suggests valkyries were probably originally viewed as \"demons of the dead to whom warriors slain on the battlefield belonged\", and that a shift in interpretation of the valkyries may have occurred \"when the concept of Valhalla changed from a battlefield to a warrior's paradise\". Simek says that this original concept was \"superseded by the shield girls—Irish female warriors who lived on like the \"einherjar\" in Valhall.\" Simek says that the valkyries were closely associated with Odin, and that this connection existed in an earlier role as \"demons of death\". Simek states that due to the shift of concept, the valkyries became popular figures in heroic poetry, and during this transition were stripped of their \"demonic characteristics and became more human, and therefore become capable of falling in love with mortals [...].\" Simek says that the majority of the names of the valkyries point to a warlike function, that most of valkyrie names do not appear to be very old, and that the names \"mostly come from poetic creativity rather than from real folk-belief.\"\n\nMacLeod and Mees theorise that \"the role of the corpse-choosing valkyries became increasingly confused in later Norse mythology with that of the Norns, the supernatural females responsible for determining human destiny [...].\"\n\nHilda Ellis Davidson says that, regarding valkyries, \"evidently an elaborate literary picture has been built up by generations of poets and storytellers, in which several conceptions can be discerned. We recognise something akin to Norns, spirits who decide destinies of men; to the seeresses, who could protect men in battle with their spells; to the powerful female guardian spirits attached to certain families, bringing luck to youth under their protection; even to certain women who armed themselves and fought like men, for whom there is some historical evidence from the regions round the Black Sea\". She adds that there may also be a memory in this of a \"priestess of the god of war, women who officiated at the sacrificial rites when captives were put to death after battle.\"\n\nDavidson places emphasis on the fact that \"valkyrie\" literally means \"chooser of the slain\". She compares Wulfstan's mention of a \"chooser of the slain\" in his \"Sermo Lupi ad Anglos\" sermon, which appears among \"a blacklist of sinners, witches and evildoers\", to \"all the other classes whom he [Wulfstan] mentions\", and concludes as those \"are human ones, it seems unlikely that he has introduced mythological figures as well.\" Davidson points out that Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan's detailed account of a 10th-century Rus ship funeral on the Volga River features an \"old Hunnish woman, massive and grim to look upon\" (who Fadlan refers to as the \"Angel of Death\") who organises the killing of the slave girl, and has two other women with her that Fadlan refers to as her daughters. Davidson says that \"it would hardly be surprising if strange legends grew up about such women, who must have been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties. Since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed, the idea that the god \"chose\" his victims, through the instrument of the priestesses, must have been a familiar one, apart from the obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war.\" Davidson says that it appears that from \"early times\" the Germanic peoples \"believed in fierce female spirits doing the command of the war god, stirring up disorder, taking part in battle, seizing and perhaps devouring the slain.\"\n\nThe goddess Freyja and her afterlife field Fólkvangr, where she receives half of the slain, has been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Britt-Mari Näsström points out the description in \"Gylfaginning\" where it is said of Freyja \"whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain\", and interprets \"Fólkvangr\" as \"the field of the Warriors\". Näsström notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is Sessrumnir (which she translates as \"filled with many seats\"), a dwelling that Näsström posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla. Näsström comments that \"still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.\"\n\nSiegfried Andres Dobat comments that \"in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death realm Fólkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role model for the Valkyrjar and the dísir.\"\n\nValkyries have been the subjects of various poems, works of art and musical works. In poetry, valkyries appear in \"\"Die Walküren\" by H. Heine (appearing in \"Romanzero\", 1847), \"\"Die Walküren\" (1864) by H. v. Linge, and \"\"Sköldmon\" (appearing in \"Gömda Land\", 1904).\n\nWorks of art depicting valkyries include \"Die Walküren\" (sketch, 1818) by J. G. Sandberg, \"Reitende Walküre\" (fresco), previously located in Munich palace but now destroyed, 1865–66 by M. Echter, \"Valkyrien\" and \"Valkyriens død\" (paintings, both from 1860), \"Walkürenritt\" (etching, 1871) by A. Welti, \"Walkürenritt\" (woodcut, 1871) by T. Pixis, \"Walkürenritt\" (1872) by A. Becker (reproduced in 1873 with the same title by A. v. Heyde), \"Die Walkyren\" (charcoal, 1880) and \"Walkyren wählen und wecken die gefallenen Helden (Einherier), um sie vom Schlachtfield nach Walhall zu geleiten\" (painting, 1882) and \"Walkyrenschlacht\" (oil painting, 1884) by K.
