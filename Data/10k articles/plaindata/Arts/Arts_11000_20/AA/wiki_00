{"id": "1020829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1020829", "title": "20th-century music", "text": "20th-century music\n\nDuring the 20th century there was a huge increase in the variety of music that people had access to. Prior to the invention of mass market gramophone records (developed in 1892) and radio broadcasting (first commercially done ca. 1919–20), people mainly listened to music at live Classical music concerts or musical theatre shows, which were too expensive for many lower-income people; on early phonograph players (a technology invented in 1877 which was not mass-marketed until the mid-1890s); or by individuals performing music or singing songs on an amateur basis at home, using sheet music, which required the ability to sing, play, and read music. These were skills that tended to be limited to middle-class and upper-class individuals. With the mass-market availability of gramophone records and radio broadcasts, listeners could purchase recordings of, or listen on radio to recordings or live broadcasts of a huge variety of songs and musical pieces from around the globe. This enabled a much wider range of the population to listen to performances of Classical music symphonies and operas that they would not be able to hear live, either due to not being able to afford live-concert tickets or because such music was not performed in their region.\n\nSound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be inexpensively and widely distributed nationwide or even, for some artists, worldwide. The development of relatively inexpensive reproduction of music via a succession of formats including vinyl records, compact cassettes, compact discs (introduced in 1983) and, by the mid-1990s, digital audio recordings, and the transmission or broadcast of audio recordings of music performances on radio, of video recordings or live performances on television, and by the 1990s, of audio and video recordings via the Internet, using file sharing of digital audio recordings, gave individuals from a wide range of socioeconomic classes access to a diverse selection of high-quality music performances by artists from around the world. The introduction of multitrack recording in 1955 and the use of mixing had a major influence on pop and rock music, because it enabled record producers to mix and overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance. The development of sound recording and audio engineering technologies and the ability to edit these recordings gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the Musique concrète (1949) and acousmatic (1955) schools of electronic composition. In the 1970s, African-American hip hop musicians began to use the record turntable as a musical instrument, creating rhythmic and percussive \"scratching\" effects by manipulating a vinyl record on the turntable.\n\nIn Beethoven's and Felix Mendelssohn's time in the 19th century, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler, the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer. Saxophones were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as Vaughan Williams' Symphonies No.6 and 9 and William Walton's \"Belshazzar's Feast\", and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. Twentieth-century orchestras generally include a string section, woodwinds, brass instruments, percussion, piano, celeste, harp(s), with other instruments called for occasionally, such as electric guitar and electric bass.\n\nThe 20th century saw dramatic innovations in musical forms and styles. Composers and songwriters explored new forms and sounds that challenged the previously accepted rules of music of earlier periods, such as the use of altered chords and extended chords in 1940s-era Bebop jazz. The development of powerful, loud guitar amplifiers and sound reinforcement systems in the 1960s and 1970s permitted bands to hold large concerts where even those with the least expensive tickets could hear the show. Composers and songwriters experimented with new musical styles, such as genre fusions (e.g., the late 1960s fusion of jazz and rock music to create jazz fusion). As well, composers and musicians used new electric, electronic, and digital instruments and musical devices. In the 1980s, some styles of music, such as electronic dance music genres such as house music were created largely with synthesizers and drum machines. Faster modes of transportation such as jet flight allowed musicians and fans to travel more widely to perform or hear shows, which increased the spread of musical styles.\n\nIn the early 20th century, many composers, including Rachmaninoff, Richard Strauss, Giacomo Puccini, and Edward Elgar, continued to work in forms and in a musical language that derived from the 19th century. However, modernism in music became increasingly prominent and important; among the most important modernists were Alexander Scriabin, Claude Debussy, and post-Wagnerian composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss, who experimented with form, tonality and orchestration. Busoni, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, and Schreker were already recognized before 1914 as modernists, and Ives was retrospectively also included in this category for his challenges to the uses of tonality. Composers such as Ravel, Milhaud, and Gershwin combined classical and jazz idioms.\n\nLate-Romantic and modernist nationalism was found also in British, American, and Latin-American music of the early 20th century. Composers such as Ralph Vaughan Williams, Aaron Copland, Alberto Ginastera, Carlos Chávez, Silvestre Revueltas, and Heitor Villa-Lobos used folk themes collected by themselves or others in many of their major compositions.\n\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, composers such as Julián Carrillo, Mildred Couper, Alois Hába, Charles Ives, Erwin Schulhoff, Ivan Wyschnegradsky turned their attention to quarter tones (24 equal intervals per octave), and other finer divisions. In the middle of the century composers such as Harry Partch and Ben Johnston explored just intonation. In the second half of the century, prominent composers employing microtonality included Easley Blackwood, Jr., Wendy Carlos, Adriaan Fokker, Terry Riley, Ezra Sims, Karlheinz Stockhausen, La Monte Young, and Iannis Xenakis.\n\nA dominant trend in music composed from 1923 to 1950 was neoclassicism, a reaction against the exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism which revived the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of earlier styles. There were three distinct \"schools\" of neoclassicism, associated with Igor Stravinsky, Paul Hindemith, and Arnold Schoenberg. Similar sympathies in the second half of the century are generally subsumed under the heading \"postmodernism\".\n\nA compositional tradition arose in the mid-20th century—particularly in North America—called \"experimental music\". Its most famous and influential exponent was John Cage (1912–1992). According to Cage, \"an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen\", and he was specifically interested in completed works that performed an unpredictable action.\nSome of the composers who influenced John Cage were Erik Satie (1866–1925), Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) and Henry Dixon Cowell (1897–1965).\n\nMinimalist music, involving a simplification of materials and intensive repetition of motives began in the late 1950s with the composers Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass. Later, minimalism was adapted to a more traditional symphonic setting by composers including Reich, Glass, and John Adams. Minimalism was practiced heavily throughout the latter half of the century and has carried over into the 21st century, as well as composers like Arvo Pärt, Henryk Górecki and John Tavener working in the \"holy minimalism\" variant. For more examples see \"List of 20th-century classical composers\".\n\nContemporary classical music can be understood as belonging to the period that started in the mid-1970s to early 1990s, which includes modernist, postmodern, neoromantic, and pluralist music. However, the term may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.\n\nMany composers working in the early 21st century were prominent figures in the 20th century. Some younger composers such as Oliver Knussen, Wolfgang Rihm, Georg Friedrich Haas, Judith Weir, George Benson, Richard Barrett, Simon Bainbridge, John Luther Adams, Toshio Hosokawa, Bright Sheng, Kaija Saariaho, Tan Dun, Magnus Lindberg, Philippe Manoury, David Lang, Hanspeter Kyburz, James MacMillan, Mark-Anthony Turnage, Thomas Adès, Marc-André Dalbavie, Unsuk Chin, Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf, and Michael Daugherty did not rise to prominence until late in the 20th century. For more examples see \"List of 21st-century classical composers\".\n\nFor centuries, instrumental music had either been created by singing, or using mechanical music technologies, such as drawing a bow across a string that is strung on a hollow instrument or plucking taut gut or metal strings (string instruments), constricting vibrating air (woodwinds and brass) or hitting something to make rhythmic sounds (percussion instruments). In the early twentieth century, electronic devices were invented that were capable of generating sound electronically, without an initial mechanical source of vibration. As early as the 1930s, composers such as Olivier Messiaen incorporated electronic instruments into live performance. While sound recording technology is often associated with the key role it played in enabling the creation and mass marketing of popular music, new electric and electronic sound recording technology was used to produce art music, as well. The musique concrète (French: “concrete music”), developed about 1948 by Pierre Schaeffer and his associates, was an experimental technique using recorded sounds as raw material.\n\nIn the years following World War II, some composers were quick to adopt developing electronic technology. Electronic music was embraced by composers such as Edgard Varèse, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Milton Babbitt, Pierre Boulez, Bruno Maderna, Henri Pousseur, Karel Goeyvaerts, Ernst Krenek, Luigi Nono, Luciano Berio, Herbert Brün, and Iannis Xenakis. In the 1950s the film industry also began to make extensive use of electronic soundtracks. Major rock groups that were early adopters of synthesizers include The Moody Blues, The Beatles, The Monkees, and The Doors.\n\nFolk music, in the original sense of the term as coined in the 18th century by Johann Gottfried Herder, is music produced by communal composition and possessing dignity, though by the late 19th century the concept of ‘folk’ had become a synonym for ‘nation’, usually identified as peasants and rural artisans, as in the Merrie England movement and the Irish and Scottish Gaelic Revivals of the 1880s. Folk music was normally shared and performed by the entire community (not by a special class of expert or professional performers, possibly excluding the idea of amateurs), and was transmitted by word of mouth (oral tradition).\n\nIn addition, folk music was also borrowed by composers in other genres. Some of the work of Aaron Copland clearly draws on American folk music.\n\nAn important work on registering traditional tunes of the Balkanic region was that of Béla Bartók since it is probably the first composer who was interested in recording audios as well as analysing them from an ethnological point of view. \nBluegrass music is a form of American roots music, and a related genre of country music. Influenced by the music of Appalachia, Bluegrass has mixed roots in Irish, Scottish, Welsh, and English traditional music, and was also later influenced by the music of African-Americans through incorporation of jazz elements.\n\nSettlers from the United Kingdom and Ireland arrived in Appalachia during the 18th century, and brought with them the musical traditions of their homelands. These traditions consisted primarily of English and Scottish ballads—which were essentially unaccompanied narrative—and dance music, such as Irish reels, which were accompanied by a fiddle. Many older bluegrass songs come directly from the British Isles. Several Appalachian bluegrass ballads, such as \"Pretty Saro\", \"Barbara Allen\", \"Cuckoo Bird\" and \"House Carpenter\", come from England and preserve the English ballad tradition both melodically and lyrically. Others, such as The Twa Sisters, also come from England; however, the lyrics are about Ireland. Some bluegrass fiddle songs popular in Appalachia, such as \"Leather Britches\", and \"Pretty Polly\", have Scottish roots. The dance tune Cumberland Gap may be derived from the tune that accompanies the Scottish ballad Bonnie George Campbell. Other songs have different names in different places; for instance in England there is an old ballad known as \"A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me\", but exactly the same song in North American bluegrass is known as \"I Wish My Baby Was Born\".\n\nIn bluegrass, as in some forms of jazz, one or more instruments each takes its turn playing the melody and improvising around it, while the others perform accompaniment; this is especially typified in tunes called breakdowns. This is in contrast to old-time music, in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment. Breakdowns are often characterized by rapid tempos and unusual instrumental dexterity and sometimes by complex chord changes.\n\nThere are three major subgenres of bluegrass and one unofficial subgenre. Traditional bluegrass has musicians playing folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and using only acoustic instruments, with an example being Bill Monroe. Progressive bluegrass groups may use electric instruments and import songs from other genres, particularly rock & roll. Examples include Cadillac Sky and Bearfoot. \"Bluegrass gospel\" has emerged as a third subgenre, which uses Christian lyrics, soulful three- or four-part harmony singing, and sometimes the playing of instrumentals. A newer development in the bluegrass world is Neo-traditional bluegrass; exemplified by bands such as The Grascals and Mountain Heart, bands from this subgenre typically have more than one lead singer. Bluegrass music has attracted a diverse following worldwide. Bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe characterized the genre as: \"Scottish bagpipes and ole-time fiddlin'. It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It's blues and jazz, and it has a high lonesome sound.\"\n\nIn the early years of the century, Wagnerian chromatic harmony was extended by opera composers such as Richard Strauss (\"Salome\", 1905; \"Elektra\", 1906–1908; \"Der Rosenkavalier\", 1910; \"Ariadne auf Naxos\", 1912; \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\", 1917), Claude Debussy (\"Pelléas et Mélisande\", 1902), Giacomo Puccini (\"Madama Butterfly\", 1904; \"La fanciulla del West\", 1910; \"Il trittico\", 1918), Ferruccio Busoni (\"Doktor Faust\", 1916, posthumously completed by his student Philipp Jarnach), Béla Bartók (\"Bluebeard's Castle\", 1911–17), Leos Janáček (\"Jenůfa\", 1904; \"Osud\", 1907; \"Kát´a Kabanová\", 1919-1921) and Hans Pfitzner (\"Palestrina\", 1917).\n\nFurther extension of the chromatic language finally broke with tonality and moved into the style of atonal music in the early operas of Arnold Schoenberg (\"Erwartung\", 1909; \"Die glückliche Hand\", 1912) and his student Alban Berg (\"Wozzeck\", 1925), both of whom adopted twelve-tone technique for their later operas: Schoenberg's \"Moses und Aron\", and Berg’s \"Lulu\". Neither of these operas were completed in their composers’ lifetimes, however, so that the first completed opera using the twelve-tone technique was \"Karl V\" (1938) by Ernst Krenek.\n\nSome of the most important operas of the twenties and thirties were composed by the Russian Dmitri Shostakovich (\"The Nose\", 1928 and \"Ledi Makbet Mtsenkovo Uyezda\" [Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District], 1932).\n\nAt the same time, the neoclassicism that became fashionable in the 1920s is represented by Stravinsky's opera buffa \"Mavra\" (1922) and his opera-oratorio \"Oedipus Rex\" (1927). Later in the century his last opera, \"The Rake's Progress\" (1951), also marks the end of the neoclassical phase of his compositions. Other operas of this period by composers identified as neoclassicists include Paul Hindemith's \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), Sergei Prokofiev's \"Voina y Mir\" (War and Peace, 1941–1943), Bohuslav Martinu's \"Julietta aneb snár\" (1937) and Francis Poulenc's \"Les mamelles de Tirésias\" (1945).\n\nIn the sixties, it should be noted, the Bernd Alois Zimmermann opera, \"Die Soldaten\" (1965), had a great impact. \n\nOne of the most particular operas of the seventies was \"Le Grand Macabre\", by György Ligeti. It deals with the subject of mortality through irony and collage.\n\nThe most internationally accepted post–World War II composer of operas was Englishman Benjamin Britten (\"Peter Grimes\", 1945; \"The Rape of Lucretia\", 1946; \"Albert Herring\", 1947; \"Billy Budd\", 1951; \"Gloriana\", 1953; \"The Turn of the Screw\", 1954; \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", 1960; \"Owen Wingrave\", 1970; \"Death in Venice\", 1973)\n\nPopular music includes Broadway tunes, ballads and singers such as Frank Sinatra.\n\nThe relationship (particularly, the relative value) of classical music and popular music is a controversial question. Richard Middleton writes:Neat divisions between \"folk\" and \"popular\", and \"popular\" and \"art\", are impossible to find... arbitrary criteria [are used] to define the complement of \"popular\". \"Art\" music, for example, is generally regarded as by nature complex, difficult, demanding; \"popular\" music then has to be defined as \"simple\", \"accessible\", \"facile\". But many pieces commonly thought of as \"art\" (Handel's \"Hallelujah Chorus\", many Schubert songs, many Verdi arias) have qualities of simplicity; conversely, it is by no means obvious that the Sex Pistols' records were \"accessible\", Frank Zappa's work \"simple\", or Billie Holiday's \"facile\".\n\nBlues musicians such as Muddy Waters brought the Delta Blues, played mostly with acoustic instruments, from the Mississippi delta north to cities like Chicago, where they used more electric instruments to form the Chicago Blues.\n\nCountry music, once known as \"Country and Western music\", is a popular musical form developed in the southern United States, with roots in traditional folk music, spirituals, and the blues.\n\nDisco is an up-tempo style of dance music that originated in the early 1970s, mainly from funk, salsa, and soul music, popular originally with homosexual and African-American audiences in large U.S. cities, and derives its name from the French word discothèque.\n\nHip hop music, also referred to as rap or rap music, is a music genre formed in the United States in the 1970s that consists of two main components: rapping (MCing) and DJing (audio mixing and scratching).\n\nJazz has evolved into many sometimes contrasting subgenres including smooth jazz, Bebop, Swing, Fusion, Dixieland and free jazz. Jazz originated in the early 20th century out of a combination of the Blues, Ragtime, Brass Band Music, Hymns and Spirituals, Minstrel music and work songs.\n\nMostly instrumental pieces creating sounds of a soothing, romantic, mood-elevating or generally relaxing nature. Steven Halpern's \"Spectrum Suite\", released in 1975, is generally credited as the album that began the new-age music movement.\n\nThe polka, which first appeared in Prague in 1837, continued to be a popular form of dance music through the 20th century, especially in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and areas of the United States with a large population of central-European descent. A particularly well-known 20th-century example is Jaromír Vejvoda’s \"Modřanská polka\" (1927), which became popular during World War II in Czechoslovakia as \"Škoda lásky\" (\"A Waste of Love\"), in Germany as the \"Rosamunde-Polka\", and among the allied armies as the \"Beer Barrel Polka\" (as a song, known as \"Roll out the Barrel\"). In the United States, the \"Eastern style\" Polish urban polka remained popular until about 1965. Polka music rose in popularity in Chicago in the late 1940s after Walter ‘Li’l Wally’ Wallace Jagiello created \"honky\" polka by combining the Polish-American rural polka with elements of Polish folksong and \"krakowiak\". A later, rock-influenced form is called \"dyno\" polka.\n\nRock and roll developed from earlier musical forms including rhythm and blues, which had earlier been called race music, and country music. See also rock musical and rock opera.\n\n"}

The directorial debut of filmmaker and actor Dany Papineau, the film premiered in Montreal on October 8, 2010.\n\nThe film stars Mirianne Brulé as Marie, a restless young woman from Quebec who decides to drop out of university and hitchhike west to Whistler, British Columbia on a voyage of self-discovery, much to her parents' dismay. The journey to British Columbia is not an easy one, as along the way Marie experiences a myriad of bumps and mishaps, with her finally arriving in Whistler only to have her luggage stolen. After this exasperating ordeal a man by the name of Jean-François (Papineau), who is also from Québec, takes Marie in to stay with him and his two roommates, his ex-girlfriend Gaby (Malka) and their gay friend Brad (Barton). During her time there Marie experiments sexually with Gaby and through this is drawn into an unexpected love triangle with both J-F and Gaby.\n\nThe film's cast also includes Brandon Barton, Juan Riedinger, Anik Vermette, Germain Houde, Diane Lavallée, Valérie Chevalier, Charlie David, Bruno Baronet, Adam Bergquist, Rick Tae, Niels Schneider, Bill Marchant and Linda Darlow.\n\nThe film is directly inspired by director Papineau's own experience travelling from his home province of Québec to Alberta during his undergraduate degree. While in Québec he had been studying engineering at Sherbrooke, but after spending a summer on a ranch in Banff, Alberta, decided to stay there instead of returning to Sherbrooke. After having such a successful time in the western part of Canada he decided to enroll at the Vancouver Film School for a year long program and ended up living in Vancouver for six years. Papineau first wrote \"2 Frogs\" as a 21 minute short film in 2004, and after receiving much acting success as a result, was able to turn the short film into the feature length film it is today. During an interview with Papineau at the 2010 Whistler Film Festival, Papineau highlighted how the inspiration for the movie came from how the young adults who come to Whistler from all around the world go there for a couple of months to help determine what they want to do with their lives. He expressed how he felt a lot of people would recognize themselves in the film because of this.\n\nAfter its debut in Montreal, the movie received excellent reviews from film critics. The film was showcased at film festivals around the world, receiving many accolades for its involvement in the LGBT film community. In 2012, it was highlighted as one of the best films at the Durban Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and was also featured in many film events devoted to the LGBT community, including QFest: the Annual Houston International LGBTQ Film Festival. Although recognized abroad, the film also received recognition in Canada, in publications like the Globe and Mail and was presented in multiple Canadian film festivals. The film not only received accolades for its portrayal of the LGBT community but also for its portrayal of Canadian culture. As the film illustrates the typical adolescent Canadian experience, of a young adult leaving their long-time home in the Eastern provinces to find work in the West of Canada, the film also received awards reflecting its Canadian influences. As a highlight, the film was chosen to close the 2010 Whistler Film Festival, after the short film, \"Two Frogs in the West\", that it was based on had been previously featured at the festival in 2004. At the festival, the film won the festival's Best Mountain Culture Film award, an award which directly reflected the spirit of the film and the area in which the festival was held.\n\nAlthough it received positive feedback at film festivals for its portrayal of both Canadian culture and the LGBT community, it received mixed reviews from its general audience for its \"predictable\" plotline. Some online reviews of the film described it has being unimaginative and the acting to be underwhelming while another reviewer claimed that \"the problems with \"2 Frogs\" are based pretty much entirely in the screenplay\". No matter how negative or positive the reviews it received were, one thing remained consistent: that Papineau has great potential as a director. No matter the downfalls described by the film's critics, \"2 Frogs\" \"demonstrates that it's possible for a film to be bad, while still showcasing the positive potential of its writer/director\".\n\n"}

The original score and songs were composed and conducted by James Horner.\n\nThe album garnered nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Music critics felt that the musical score fit the film well, but believed it to be similar to several of Horner's previous films.\n\nComposer James Horner was a frequent collaborator with Ron Howard, the director of \"A Beautiful Mind\". Horner desired to feature vocals reminiscent of being midway between a girl and woman, and wrote the score specifically for 15-year-old Welsh singer Charlotte Church. In an interview, she stated that it was \"one of the most haunting and beautiful [things] I have ever performed.\" To convey \"the beauty of mathematics,\" Horner decided to use the idea of a kaleidoscope, as its \"patterns are always changing, and things move very quickly, but in moving so quickly, they create other patterns that move very slowly underneath.\" He added that these changing patterns were conveyed with the piano and Church's voice.\n\nWriting for \"Empire\" magazine, Danny Graydon gave the soundtrack four out of five stars. He thought the score contained elements of Horner's previous films \"Sneakers\" (1992) and \"Bicentennial Man\" (1999), but said \"if you can forgive that, this is a clever, masterful and romantic score that captures a brilliant mind in conflict.\" In the tracks \"Creating Government Dynamics\" and \"Cracking The Russian Codes\", Graydon opined that Church's \"poignant vocals mix well with the frenetic piano and strings to represent Nash’s brilliance,\" and wished that her voice had been used more in the film.\n\nDan Goldwasser of Soundtrack.net also found similarities to the score in \"Bicentennial Man\", but thought Horner's work fit the film regardless, explaining \"it effectively underscores the drama and romance, and even provides a few bits of tension for the action scene.\" Goldwasser concluded that \"while it all works well in the film, there is enough about this score that just seemed to 'familiar' to make it stand out. Contributing to National Public Radio, Andy Trudeau believed Church's particular voice adds a \"human element. It's the sound that, I think, gives a sense of--the center of this character, if you will. I think it's the soul. And it's trying to be normal in a way, and underneath it it's trying to be crazy.\"\n\nHorner's score garnered nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the Academy Award for Best Original Score.

This process of studying the method and reassessing its effectiveness allows art to move on and change. It is not the thing itself but it is an essential part of the process. \n\nAn artist drawing, for instance, may choose to draw from what he or she observes in front of them, or from what they \"imagine\" or from what they already know about the subject. These 3 methods will, very probably, produce 3 very different pictures. A careful methodology would include examination of the materials and tools used and how a different type of canvas/brush/paper/pencil/rag/camera/chisel etc. would produce a different effect. The artist may also look at various effects achieved by starting in one part of a canvas first, or by working over the whole surface equally. An author may experiment with stream of consciousness writing, as opposed to naturalistic narrative, or a combination of styles.\n\nIn stark contrast to fine art practice is the traditional craft form. With traditional crafts, the method is handed down from generation to generation with often very little change in techniques. It is usually fair to say that folk crafts employ a method but not an art methodology, since that would involve rigorous questioning and criticising of the tradition.\n\nAn art methodology differs from a science methodology, perhaps mainly insofar as the artist is not always after the same goal as the scientist. In art it is not necessarily all about establishing the exact truth so much as making the most effective form (painting, drawing, poem, novel, performance, sculpture, video, etc.) through which ideas, feelings, perceptions can be communicated to a public. With this purpose in mind, some artists will exhibit preliminary sketches and notes which were part of the process leading to the creation of a work. Sometimes, in Conceptual art, the preliminary process is the only part of the work which \"is\" exhibited, with no visible end result displayed. In such a case the \"journey\" is being presented as more important than the destination. Conceptual artist Robert Barry once put on an exhibition where the door of the gallery remained shut and a sign on the door informed visitors that the gallery would be closed for the exhibition. These kind of works question accepted concepts, such as that of having a tangible work of art as end result.\n\nThe Peace Through Art methodology developed by the International Child Art Foundation (ICAF) was recognized as a Stockholm Challenge Finalist for best practice and innovative initiative, in Stockholm, Sweden. ICAF's statement on the methodology of the programme says: \"the Peace Through Art methodology draws upon the creativity and imagination of young people, and teaches them the ethics of responsibility in this interdependent global village that has come to be our world. The methodology incorporates best practices from the fields of psychology, conflict resolution and peace education, while employing the power of the arts for self-expression, healing and communication.\"\n\nIn Art Therapy and other applied forms of art to the needs of groups within the community art methodology is built up in relation to other methodologies, such as that of psychotherapy. \n\nPauline Mottram SRAsTh, gave a short paper entitled \"“Towards developing a methodology to evaluate outcomes of Art Therapy in Adult Mental Illness.”\" for the October 2000 TAoAT Conference. Here's an excerpt: \n\n\"In addressing the effectiveness challenge and in seeking a means of measuring outcomes of the art therapy service that I deliver, I have sought a methodology that can provide a valid and reliable quantitative outcome, whilst still respecting the aesthetic and humanistic nature of art therapy practice. This endeavour is made all the more complex by the fact that art therapy lacks a fully developed theory and it has a fragile research base. Generally it is argued that art therapy is more compatible with qualitative research designs that encompass subjectivity, rather than quantitative objective methods. Kaplan (1998, p95) states that ‘Qualitative is exploratory and theory building. Quantitative tests hypothesis in order to refine and validate theory.’ She holds that art therapy cannot afford to reject either form of inquiry.\"\n\nIn \"The Methodology of Generative Art\" by Tjark Ihmels and Julia Riedel, an online article at Media Art Net Mozart's \"musical game of dice\" is cited as a precedent for the methodology of Generative art which, say the authors, has \"established itself in nearly every area of artistic practice (music, literature [3], the fine arts).\": \n\n\"Mozart composed 176 bars of music, from which sixteen were chosen from a list using dice, which then produced a new piece when performed on a piano. Sixteen bars, each with eleven possibilities, can result in 1,116 unique pieces of music. Using this historical example, the methodology of generative art can be appropriately described as the rigorous application of predefined principles of action for the intentional exclusion of, or substitution for, individual aesthetical decisions that sets in motion the generation of new artistic content out of material provided for that purpose.\" \n\n"}
{"id": "24629124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24629124", "title": "Bani Thani", "text": "Bani Thani\n\nBani Thani refers to an Indian miniature painting painted by Nihâl Chand from the Marwar school of Kishangarh. It portrays a woman who is elegant and graceful. The painting's subject, Bani Thani, was a singer and poet in Kishangarh in the time of king Sawant Singh (1748–1764). She has been compared to the Mona Lisa.\n\nInspired by Radha, Bani Thani is characterized by idealized distinct features such as arched eyebrows, lotus-like elongated eyes and pointed chin. This painting was featured in an Indian stamp issued on 5 May 1973. \n\nBani Thani was believed to be the mistress of King Sawant Singh, and later became one of his wives. Her real name was Vishnupriya. She was a singer employed by his stepmother and he was drawn to her because of her beauty and singing. She came to be known as 'Bani Thani', which means \"the decked out lady\", because of the exquisite jewellery and makeup that she used to adorn herself with after becoming queen. He also wrote poetry for her under the pen name of Nagari Das. Their love bloomed due to a shared interest in singing, poetry and devotion for Krishna. She also wrote poetry under the pen name of Rasikbihari. Later, he commissioned his artists to depict their relationship in a way similar to the love between Radha and Krishna. Both lovers died in the 1760s. They have twin chhatris dedicated to them near the Nagari Kunj temple.\n\nThe Kishangarh school of art is notable for its elongated style, with \"arched eyebrows, lotus-like elongated eyes and pointed chin\" a highly idealized facial form reminiscent of Indian sculpture art. Kishangarh was influenced by Būndi painting in its use of lush vegetation, dramatic night skies, vivid movement and Mughal painting in its use of side-profile portraits, though it can be distinguished from both of them due to its extremely meticulous details, rich colours and fine technique. The patron-king Savant Singh was a member of the Vallabhācārya sect devoted to Krishna, due to which religiously themed paintings flourished in the court under his patronage. The paintings of Kishangarh school are characterised by a religious fervour and this might have been the reason why the portraiture of the queen was compared to, and is believed to have been inspired by, the figure of Radha.\n\nWithin the Ashta Nayika classification system of heroines, the Bani Thani is identified as the Vasakasajja Nayika type, with the element of Sringara rasa (romantic love) predominating. Hence, the painting conveys the passionate and romantic elements of the legend. She has been portrayed with all the elements of Sringara and exaggerated facial features which are unrealistic but striking. This style of portraiture later became the standard of beauty in all the later paintings of the Kishangarh school.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40846635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40846635", "title": "Better Out Than In", "text": "Better Out Than In\n\nBetter Out Than In was a residency undertaken by pseudonymous graffiti artist and political activist Banksy in New York City during October 2013. Banksy unveiled at least one work of art daily, documenting it on both a dedicated website and an Instagram account. The majority of the works were stencil graffiti and chiefly political, a distinctive characteristic of Banksy. Other pieces and multimedia exhibits toyed with dark humor and satire.\n\nThe unpredictability of the show and Banksy's elusive nature stirred excitement amongst fans, while defacement from competing street artists and vandals became an imminent problem. While Banksy's works were inherently illegal, no official complaints were reported to the police; most property owners praised the art and some took measures to protect it. The month-long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its more politically strong pieces, and received mixed reviews from critics. \n\nAn HBO documentary film covering this period and residency titled \"Banksy Does New York\" was released in 2014.\n\nOn 1 October 2013, Banksy announced on his website that he would be attempting to host a show in New York City for the entire month. This came after posters promoting an October event started showing up in Los Angeles.\n\nThe title \"Better Out Than In\" is a reference to a quote by impressionist Paul Cézanne, \"All pictures painted inside, in the studio, will never be as good as those done outside.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"The Village Voice\", Banksy said \"New York calls to graffiti writers like a dirty old lighthouse. We all want to prove ourselves here,\" and that he chose it for the high foot traffic and hiding places.\n\nThe works Banksy has included in \"Better Out Than In\" primarily consist of stencil graffiti, much of which are political in nature. His first installment, which he captioned \"the street is in play\", depicted a child reaching for a bottle of spray paint on a sign reading \"graffiti is a crime\". The sign was stolen and later replaced by Queens-based graffiti group Smart Crew with a new sign that read \"street art is a crime\". Like most of his other works, the piece has audio accompaniment that can be heard either on the website or by calling a toll-free 800 number.\n\nIn the East Village, Banksy's fifth work was housed in a delivery truck as a \"mobile garden,\" which included theatrical property showing a rainbow, waterfall, and butterflies. The following day Banksy posted a photo of a tracking device he found under the vehicle.\n\nBanksy's installments are located all across the five boroughs, with some being purely multimedia exhibits. On 6 October, as a way to have made an installment in Dumbo, Brooklyn, a primary arts district of the city, Banksy posted a video featuring the Walt Disney character Dumbo being shot down by Syrian rebels, the meaning behind which puzzled many.\n\nOn 9 October, Banksy unveiled one of the more elaborate and politically strong pieces of the series. It featured armed soldiers and horses spray-painted on a car and trailer in an empty lot in the Lower East Side. Instead of commentary about the work, the accompanying audio was that of a classified video from the July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike. After being dismantled, the car was towed away to prevent further defacement.\n\nDay 11 saw an elaborate political display questioning the \"casual cruelty\" of the meat industry. Entitled \"Sirens of the Lambs\", Banksy drove around a military-style cargo truck filled with squealing, stuffed animatronic livestock. The truck fittingly made its debut in Meatpacking District, Manhattan, but toured the rest of the city in the following weeks.\n\nOn 13 October, Banksy made headlines when it was revealed that the art an older man was selling outside Central Park was actually authentic, signed Banksy canvases, sold for only $60 each. Having not announced this beforehand, tourists and park goers were unaware of the value the paintings had, which the BBC estimated could be upwards of $32,000 each. Banksy posted a video on his website chronicling the surprise sale, which revealed that a total of seven paintings were sold for $420 taking.\n\nBanksy unveiled one of his most controversial pieces of the series on 15 October, with a depiction of the Lower Manhattan skyline featuring the former Twin Towers, with a burnt-orange chrysanthemum in place where one of the hijacked airplanes struck the North Tower. The silhouette appeared on the side of a building in TriBeCa, with an identical depiction along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, facing the downtown skyline. The Brooklyn Heights piece was eventually buffed out by the city, requiring chemicals and a high-powered pressure washer. The removal followed a taunt Banksy had directed toward the city on his website. Meanwhile, the sister piece in TriBeCa served as a shrine, people placing flowers next to it, as well as a letter asking no one to touch the painting. Acrylic glass was eventually installed to protect the piece, before someone painted over it.\n\nBanksy extended his work beyond the canvas and city street with other political statements, including on 16 October, when he crafted a giant fiberglass sculpture of Ronald McDonald, with a real live Banksy assistant shining its shoes. It was unveiled in the Bronx but was moved outside of a different McDonald's restaurant across the city around lunch time for several days. The work criticized the \"heavy labor required to sustain the polished image of a mega-corporation\", as the narrator of the audio accompaniment put it.\n\nOn 18 October there was a pair of paintings that Banksy collaborated on with Os Gemeos depicting a single soldier amongst masked citizens and vice versa. \"The audio commentary Banksy provided suggests that this piece functions both as situational criticism of the art world as well as a tribute to the Occupy movement. Yet it also recognizes that the installation may be unsuccessful at actually advancing any agenda\".\n\nBanksy's second trip to the South Bronx was on 21 October and resulted in a piece depicting a child spray-painting the words \"Ghetto 4 Life\" on a wall, while a butler waited on him with a platter of spray paints. The work immediately drew a crowd from fans, despite angering many residents, who found the message offensive.\n\nThe Sphinx sculpture appeared on a worksite in Willets Point on 22 October, entitled \"Everything but the kitchen sphinx\", and was quickly swarmed by eager Banksy fans. The attention caught the workers interest, who were reportedly selling bricks for $100 each, and onlookers watched as it was loaded into a truck and taken away. The fate of this piece was heavily chronicled by the HBO documentary \"Banksy Does New York\" (2014). The piece was taken from its original site, kept in a garage and later appeared in the Art Miami New York modern art fair.\n\nThe 23rd installment was cancelled due to police activity, according to Banksy's official website, which stirred rumors that he had come under arrest. That same day, an outlined canvas with the caption \"Better Out Than In #AnonymousGuestbook\" appeared on a building in Red Hook. The idea of an open-canvas collaborative piece was presented to Banksy two weeks prior by a community art director. The story then led many to believe the \"anonymous guestbook\" was outlined by Banksy himself, however this was later debunked to have been the work of a group under the name Anonymous Guestbook.\n\n\"Waiting in Vain\" was the show's 24th installment. Located outside a strip club in Hell's Kitchen, it illustrated a man in a tuxedo holding flowers, presumably jilted by his date. After some of the club's entertainers posed in front of the piece, the owner had it carefully cut from the shutter gate before vandals could deface it. It is planned to go on permanent display inside the club.\n\nThe 25th piece came suitably Halloween-themed. Located on the Bowery, it exhibited a Grim Reaper riding a bumper car in circles to an elaborate light show, fog machine and Blue Öyster Cult's \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper.\" The accompanying audio guide offered a self-mocking interpretation, with Banksy stating that often \"the role of art is to remind us of our mortality,\" implying that with this mounted art show that goes on \"for so long we wish we were dead already.\" The site of the exhibit was once that of an antique shop, some remains of which were placed in a coffin that occupied the lot for months. This prompted other interpretations of the installation's message, paying homage to the \"ghosts of Bowry,\" as the antique store owner suggested.\n\nThe 27 October piece was a message on a wall in Greenpoint that read \"This site contains blocked messages.\" It made reference to an unpublished column Banksy had submitted to \"The New York Times\". The controversial essay criticized the city's decision in approving the One World Trade Center, which he described as \"vanilla\" and looking like \"something they would build in Canada.\" In what became his second reference to the September 11 attacks, Banksy argued the building was a betrayal to everyone who lost their lives that day, and that its blandness is a sign the terrorist won.\n\nThe final piece of the month-long series was a group of balloons that together read \"BANKSY!\", tied to the wall of a building alongside the Long Island Expressway in Queens. Banksy included the message \"Save 5pointz\" in the caption for the piece on his website, referring to 5 Pointz, a nearby outdoor art exhibit considered to be a focal point of such culture that had recently been approved by the New York City Department of City Planning to be demolished to make way for condominiums.\n\nMost of the works that make up the \"Better Out Than In\" series were defaced, some just hours after the piece was unveiled. At least one defacement was identified as done by a competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy's red mylar balloon piece in Red Hook. OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy's work in May 2010.\n\nAs a result of the continued defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took matters into their own hands by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In part because of the defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property owners have also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with acrylic glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.\n\nThe month-long show was widely publicized and covered by the media. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, while supporting the arts, criticized Banksy's work, calling him a vandal, contending that defacing property was not his definition of art.\n\nOn 17 October the \"New York Post\" wrote under the front-page headline \"Get Banksy!\" that police were pursuing Banksy, but noted the hunt is difficult because he has never been positively identified in public. In response Banksy posted an image of the front page on his website with the caption \"I don't read what i believe in the papers.\" The NYPD later denied they were actively looking for Banksy as no property owners had filed any formal complaints.\n\nBronx Borough President Rubén Díaz, Jr. called Banksy a \"modern-day Picasso\" and praised him for choosing to unveil his 16 October Ronald McDonald replica in the South Bronx. This came before Banksy's 21 October piece, which brought discontent to the President and other residents. The piece featured a child spray-painting the words \"Ghetto 4 Life\" on a wall. Díaz stated it reinforced \"outdated negative stereotypes,\" and defended that Banksy should become aware that graffiti art and culture originated in the Bronx. The owner of the graffitied wall and his partner, however, praised the work and its message, calling it \"beautiful\" and owning its preservation to the artist's fame.\n\nBanksy's op-ed article about One World Trade Center, posted on his website on 27 October, came as an insult to many across the city. Former FDNY Deputy Chief Jim Riches wrote that it was a \"disgrace to New York City and all the families who lost loved ones on 9/11.\" Sally Regenhard, a leading voice for families of 11 September victims, expressed concerns about Banksy's 15 October depiction of the Twin Towers in TriBeCa, saying the piece was \"horrific\" and that the placed flower looked more like an explosion. A Century 21 department store near Ground Zero had planned to show Banksy's work on 29 October, but cancelled due to the controversy.\n\nBanksy's \"Better Out Than In\" series has received mixed reviews. Many fans raved over his work, flocking to each site everyday of the show.\n\n\"New York\" magazine art critic Jerry Saltz wrote Banksy's well-executed work stood out from other graffiti, but that the meaning behind the pieces aren't as deep as fans like to believe. \"No other graffiti artist has a PR machine remotely like Banksy's,\" he writes, arguing Banksy is more of a \"promo man\" than an artist.\n\nWill Ellsworth-Jones, author of \"Banksy: The Man Behind the Wall\" writes that \"Better Out Than In\" shows Banksy's range of mediums has grown to incorporate multi-media and performance-based works. He pointed out the \"wonderful commentary on money and art\" displayed with hiring an anonymous salesman to sell Banksy paintings in Central Park for $60.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16839300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16839300", "title": "Brave (2012 film)", "text": "Brave (2012 film)\n\nBrave is a 2012 American computer-animated fantasy drama adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman and co-directed by Steve Purcell. The story is by Chapman, with the screenplay by Andrews, Purcell, Chapman and Irene Mecchi. The film was produced by Katherine Sarafian, with John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter as executive producers. The film's voice cast features Kelly Macdonald, Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd, and Craig Ferguson. Set in the Scottish Highlands, the film tells the story of a princess named Merida who defies an age-old custom, causing chaos in the kingdom by expressing the desire not to be betrothed.\n\nChapman drew inspiration for the film's story from her relationship with her own daughter. Co-directing with Mark Andrews, Chapman became Pixar's first female director of a feature-length film. To create the most complex visuals possible, Pixar completely rewrote their animation system for the first time in 25 years. \"Brave\" is the first film to use the Dolby Atmos sound format.\n\n\"Brave\" premiered on June 10, 2012, at the Seattle International Film Festival, and was released in North America on June 22, 2012, to both positive reviews and box office success. The film won the Academy Award, the Golden Globe, and the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Feature Film. Preceding the feature theatrically was a short film entitled \"La Luna\", directed by Enrico Casarosa.\n\nIn Medieval Scotland, Princess Merida of the clan Dunbroch is given a bow and arrow by her father, King Fergus, for her sixth birthday to the dismay of her mother, Queen Elinor. While venturing into the woods to fetch a stray arrow, Merida encounters a will-o'-the-wisp. Soon afterward, Mor'du, a huge demon bear, attacks the family. Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mor'du, though the fight costs him one of his legs.\n\nTen years later, Merida discovers that to her dismay, she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her father's allies. Reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his father's wishes destroyed his kingdom, Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch.\n\nThe allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the Highland games for Merida's hand in marriage. Merida twists the rules, announcing that as her own clan's firstborn she is eligible to compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors in an archery contest, shaming the other clans. Later, she and Elinor argue and Merida leaves. After following the wisps to the hut of an elderly witch, Merida bargains with her for a spell to change her fate.\n\nWhen Merida gives the spell, in the form of a cake, to Elinor, it causes Elinor to transform into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the witch's cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch: unless Merida is able to \"mend the bond torn by pride\" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mor'du. Realizing that Mor'du was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she damaged during their argument.\n\nThey return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Having learned from her experience with her mother, Merida intends to declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but with nonverbal encouragement from Elinor, instead insists that the first-borns should be allowed to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.\n\nMerida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor. Elinor, who is losing her humanity, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle. Mistaking the queen for Mor'du and unwilling to listen to Merida, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle. With the help of her younger triplet brothers, who also ate the cake and have been transformed into bear cubs, Merida escapes and repairs the tapestry while riding after her father. Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida intervenes and stops her father before Mor'du arrives. Mor'du batters the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mor'du and causing him to be crushed by a falling menhir. This releases the spirit of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida realizes the mistakes she has made and reconciles with Elinor, unknowingly fulfilling the real meaning of the witch's message, causing the queen and the princes to turn back into humans.\n\nWith Mor'du gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry when they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses.\n\n\nAnnounced in April 2008 as \"The Bear and the Bow\", \"Brave\" is Pixar's first fairy tale. Writer and director Brenda Chapman considers it a fairy tale in the tradition of Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm. She also drew inspiration from her relationship with her daughter. Chapman conceived the project and was announced as the film's director, making her Pixar's first female director, but in October 2010, she was replaced by Mark Andrews after creative disagreements. Chapman found the news of her replacement \"devastating,\" but later stated that her \"vision came through in the film\" and that she remained \"very proud of the movie, and that I ultimately stood up for myself.\"\n\nThe end credits include a special tribute to Pixar co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs, who died in 2011.\n\n\"Brave\" is the first Pixar film starring a female protagonist. In that respect, \"Brave\" was followed by \"Inside Out\", \"Finding Dory\", and \"Incredibles 2\", all of whom featured female protagonists. Merida was originally to be voiced by Reese Witherspoon, who declined due to scheduling issues. According to Andrews, she was on the project for \"quite some time. She was getting her Scottish accent down, she was working very hard and it was sounding great but as we were continuing with the movie she had other movies lining up, so unfortunately we were unable to continue with her and had to get a replacement.\" Instead, the character was voiced by Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald. In 2016, while promoting \"Sing\", Witherspoon mentioned that she had to leave the film due to failure to master a Scottish accent.\n\nThe score for \"Brave\" was composed by Patrick Doyle and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra was conducted by James Shearman. To bring some of Scotland's native flavor to the music, Doyle used traditional Celtic instruments such as bagpipes, a solo fiddle, Celtic harps, flutes and the bodhrán, with an electronically treated dulcimer and cimbalom to give it a more contemporary feel. \"I employed many classic Scottish dance rhythms such as reels, jigs, and strathspeys, which not only serve the action but keep it authentic,\" said Doyle. As part of his research, he spent time in the Hebrides studying \"unaccompanied Gaelic psalm singing.\"\n\nDoyle also composed several songs for the film. The lullaby duet between characters Princess Merida and Queen Elinor entitled \"A Mhaighdean Uasal Bhan (Noble Maiden Fair)\" appears on three occasions in different variations within the fabric of the score, and uniquely includes Gaelic vocals by Emma Thompson and Peigi Barker, the first Disney film with music featuring the language. The drinking song \"Song of Mor'du\" (lyrics by Doyle and Steve Purcell) sung by Billy Connolly, Scott Davies, Patrick Doyle, Gordon Neville, Alex Norton and Carey Wilson, features a rich variety of words, sung authentically in Scots, which is distinct from Scottish Gaelic. (Scots being a Germanic language, while Scottish Gaelic is Celtic.)\n\nIn addition to Doyle's music, the film features three other original songs; \"Learn Me Right\" written by Mumford & Sons and performed with Birdy, \"Touch the Sky\" (music by Alex Mandel, lyrics by Mark Andrews & Mandel) and \"Into the Open Air\" (music and lyrics by Alex Mandel). Both \"Touch the Sky\" and \"Into the Open Air\" were performed by Julie Fowlis, as Merida's off-screen musical thoughts. These two tracks were produced by composer and arranger Jim Sutherland, who is also featured as a performer.\n\nAlong with introducing Doyle to a number of specialist Celtic musicians who feature in the score, Sutherland was responsible for discovering the young Gaelic singer Peigi Barker; the voice of Young Merida.\n\nWalt Disney Records released the soundtrack on both CD album and digital download on June 19, 2012.\n\nPixar created three original tartan patterns for the film for three of the four clans – DunBroch, Dingwall, and MacGuffin. (Clan Macintosh wears a red tartan similar to the nonfictional Clan Mackintosh.)\n\nThe Walt Disney Company registered the Clan DunBroch tartan with the official Scottish Register of Tartans upon release of the film. The tartan consists of ocean blue for the North Sea, subdued scarlet for bloodshed during the clan wars, deep green for the Scottish Highlands, navy blue for the eventual unity of the four clans, and gray for the Scottish people. In selecting the color scheme, Pixar took historical considerations, stating that \"[t]here was a concerted effort to use hues that were indicative of the less saturated dyeing techniques [used] during the ancient period in which the fantasy film is set.\"\n\nThe registration was celebrated at the film's British premiere in Edinburgh, where Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond presented a certificate to director Mark Andrews. However, Member of the Scottish Parliament Alex Johnstone criticized the registration (as well as other fiction-based entries such as one for Peter Rabbit) as \"shallow and irreverent.\" Mr. Johnstone contended that the 2008 legislation that created The Scottish Register of Tartans was intended to prevent such entries and protect Scotland's heritage.\n\nThe registration was not the first for Disney; the company also registered a tartan pattern for the Clan McDuck in 1942.\n\nThe film was initially set for release on June 15, 2012, but the date was later changed to June 22, 2012. On April 3, 2012, Pixar screened the film's first 30 minutes, which received a positive reaction. The film premiered on the last day of the Seattle International Film Festival on June 10, 2012. It had its Australian premiere on June 11, 2012, at the Sydney Film Festival, its domestic premiere on June 18, 2012, at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre as part of the Los Angeles Film Festival, its European premiere at the Taormina Film Festival in Sicily on June 23, 2012, and its British premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on June 30, 2012, with Kelly Macdonald, Robbie Coltrane, Craig Ferguson, Brian Cox, Kevin McKidd, Ewen Bremner, Kate Dickie, Julie Fowlis, Patrick Doyle, Daniela Nardini and Alex Salmond in attendance.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"Brave\" is the first feature-length film to use the Dolby Atmos sound format. Almost half of the 14 theaters set up to show the film in Atmos are in California (Burbank, Century City, Fremont, Hollywood, San Francisco, and Sherman Oaks), with the others located in seven other states (Lake Buena Vista, Florida; Kansas City, Missouri; Paramus, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada; Chicago; West Plano, Texas; Vancouver, Washington) and Toronto, Ontario. It was released in other theaters with Dolby Surround 7.1. In total, it was released in 4,164 theaters, a record-high for Pixar. The previous record was held by \"Cars 2\" (4,115 theaters). 2,790 of the theaters included 3D shows.\n\n\"Brave\" was released on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, DVD, and digital download on November 13, 2012. It includes \"La Luna\" and a new short film, \"The Legend of Mor'du,\" which explores the history of Mor'du, from The Witch's perspective. The DVD contains audio commentary by director Mark Andrews, co-director/screenwriter Steve Purcell, story supervisor Brian Larsen, and editor Nick Smith.\n\n\"Brave\" earned $237.3 million in North America, and $303.2 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $540.4 million. It was the 13th highest-grossing film of 2012, the eighth highest-grossing Pixar film, and the third highest-grossing animated film that year behind \"\" ($875.3 million) and \"\" ($746.9 million).\n\nIn North America, pre-release tracking suggested the film would open between $55 million to $65 million in North America, which is slightly below average for a Pixar film, as trackers initially suggested that as a \"princess story\", the film might not appeal as much to male audiences.\n\nIt opened on June 22, 2012, with $24.6 million and finished its opening weekend with $66.3 million (the same amount as \"Cars 2\", Pixar's previous film), at the upper end of the numbers analysts predicted. This was the seventh largest opening weekend in June, and the sixth largest for a Pixar film. Despite pre-release tracking indications, the audience was estimated to be 43% male and 57% female. In North America, it is the ninth highest-grossing Pixar film, the highest-grossing 2012 animated film, and the eighth highest-grossing film of 2012.\n\nOutside North America, the film earned $14 million from 10 markets on its opening weekend, finishing in third place behind \"Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted\" and \"Snow White and the Huntsman\". Overall, its largest openings occurred in France and the Maghreb region ($6.5 million), Mexico ($5.53 million), and Russia and the CIS ($5.37 million). In total earnings, its highest-grossing countries were the U.K., Ireland and Malta ($34.9 million), France and the Maghreb region ($26.8 million), and Mexico ($21.6 million).\n\n\"Brave\" received a 79% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 237 critics, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"\"Brave\" offers young audiences and fairy tale fans a rousing, funny fantasy adventure with a distaff twist and surprising depth.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 69 based on 37 reviews, or \"generally favorable\". The film was well-received among American audiences, earning an \"A\", according to CinemaScore.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. He wrote, \"The good news is that the kids will probably love it, and the bad news is that parents will be disappointed if they're hoping for another Pixar groundbreaker. Unlike such brightly original films as \"Toy Story\", \"Finding Nemo\", \"WALL-E\", and \"Up\", this one finds Pixar poaching on traditional territory of Disney.\" He said that the film did have an uplifting message about improving communication between mothers and daughters, \"although transforming your mother into a bear is a rather extreme first step\". Peter Debruge of \"Variety\" gave a positive review of the film, writing that the film \"offers a tougher, more self-reliant heroine for an era in which princes aren't so charming, set in a sumptuously detailed Scottish environment, where her spirit blazes bright as her fiery red hair\". Debruge said that \"adding a female director, Brenda Chapman, to its creative boys' club, the studio Pixar has fashioned a resonant tribute to mother-daughter relationships that packs a level of poignancy on par with such beloved male-bonding classics as \"Finding Nemo\"\".\n\nConversely, Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave it a negative review, stating that the film \"diminishes into a rather wee thing as it chugs along, with climactic drama that is both too conveniently wrapped up and hinges on magical elements that are somewhat confusing to boot\". Leonard Maltin on \"IndieWire\" said, \"I'll give it points for originality, but that story twist is so bizarre that it knocked me for a loop. The movie tries to make up for this detour with a heart-tugging, emotional finale, but the buildup to that moment has been undermined, so it doesn’t have the impact it should.\"\n\nSome reviewers saw the Merida character as a novel break from the traditional line of Disney princesses. There were some dissonance and criticism among viewers and organized feminists when her character was scheduled to be \"crowned\" a Disney princess, only for artists to render her thinner, with less frizzy hair, and rounder eyes, more like the other princesses from previous Disney movies. This inspired girl-empowerment website A Mighty Girl to file a petition that Disney not alter their character. One of the 262,196 signatories was Brenda Chapman, the director of the film, who felt that Disney had \"betrayed the essence of what we were trying to do with Merida — give young girls and women a better, stronger role model\", and that the makeover was \"a blatantly sexist marketing move based on money\". The online petition was considered a success, as shortly after it appeared Disney removed the redesigned image from their official website, in favor of Merida's original film appearance. Disney later clarified the situation, assuring that Merida would remain in her original form.\n\nA video game based on the film was published by Disney Interactive Studios on June 19, 2012, for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PC, and Nintendo DS. A mobile video game, \"\" (a \"Brave\" variation of \"Temple Run\"), was released on June 14, 2012, for iOS and Android, and on June 7, 2013, for Windows Phone.\n\nScottish publication \"The Scotsman\" asked director Mark Andrews about the possibility of a sequel. Andrews said: \n\n\n"}

{"id": "772629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=772629", "title": "Canon (fiction)", "text": "Canon (fiction)\n\nIn fiction, canon is the material accepted as officially part of the story in the fictional universe of that story. It is often contrasted with, or used as the basis for, works of fan fiction. The alternative terms mythology, timeline, universe and continuity are often used, with the former being especially used to refer to a richly detailed fictional canon requiring a large degree of suspension of disbelief (e.g. an entire imaginary world and history), while the latter two typically refer to a single arc where all events are directly connected chronologically. Other times, the word can mean \"to be acknowledged by the creator(s)\".\n\nThe use of the word \"canon\" originated in reference to a set of texts derives from Biblical canon, the set of books regarded as scripture, as contrasted with non-canonical Apocrypha. The term was first used by analogy in the context of fiction to refer to the Sherlock Holmes stories and novels, written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as contrasted with numerous Holmes adventures added later by other writers. This usage was afterwards extended to the writings of various other authors.\n\nThe term \"canon\" nowadays refers to all works of fiction within a franchise's fictional universe which are considered \"to have actually happened\" within the fictional universe they belong to.\n\nWhen there are multiple \"official\" works or original media, the question of what is canonical can be unclear. This is resolved either by explicitly excluding certain media from the status of canon (as in the case of \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\"), by assigning different levels of canonicity to different media (as was in the case of \"Star Wars\" before the franchise was purchased by Disney), by considering different but licensed media treatments official and equally canonical to the series timeline within their own continuities universe, but not across them, or not resolved at all. The use of canon is of particular importance with regard to reboots or re-imaginings of established franchises, such as the \"Star Trek\" remake (2009), because of the ways in which it influences the viewer experience.\n\nThe official \"Star Trek\" website describes \"Star Trek\" canon as \"the events that take place within the episodes and movies\" (that is, the television series \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", and the \"Star Trek\" film series, with \"\" having long existed in a ). Events, characters and storylines from tie-in novels, comic books, and video games are explicitly excluded from the \"Star Trek\" canon, but the site notes that elements from these sources have been subsequently introduced into the television series, and says that \"canon is not something set in stone.\" One example of a non-canonical element that later became canonical in the Star Trek universe were the first names for Sulu and Uhura, introduced in novels, plus \"Tiberius\" becoming the official middle name of Enterprise captain James T. Kirk. The name was introduced in the \"Star Trek\" animated series, and was later added into the official biography of the character by its mention in the live-action film \"\" (1991).\n\nThe \"Star Wars\" canon originally existed on several levels. The highest level was the original \"Star Wars\" films, and statements by George Lucas; tie-in fiction from the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe had a different level of canonicity. The complex system was maintained by Leland Chee, a Lucasfilm employee. After Disney bought the franchise, all material published prior to April 25, 2014 that was not any of the Star Wars movies or the CGI cartoon \"The Clone Wars\" was declared in the \"Legends\" continuity, marking them as no longer official canon. All subsequent material exists on the same level of canon, with the Lucasfilm Story Group being established to ensure no contradictions among canon works.\n\nThe makers of \"Doctor Who\" have generally avoided making pronouncements about canonicity, with Russell T Davies explaining that he does not think about the concept for the \"Doctor Who\" television series or its spin-offs.\n\nIn literature, the term \"canon\" is used to distinguish between the original works of a writer who created certain characters and/or settings, and the later works of other writers who took up the same characters or setting. For example, the canon of Sherlock Holmes consists of the 56 short stories and four novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and featuring the detective Sherlock Holmes. The subsequent works by other authors who took up Sherlock Holmes are considered \"non-canonical\".\n\nFan fiction is almost never regarded as canonical. However, certain ideas may become influential or widely accepted within fan communities, who refer to such ideas as \"fanon\", a portmanteau of \"fan\" and \"canon\". Similarly, the jargon \"headcanon\" is used to describe a fan's personal interpretation of a fictional universe.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3104469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3104469", "title": "Cavetto", "text": "Cavetto\n\nA cavetto is a concave moulding with a regular curved profile that is part of a circle, widely used in architecture as well as furniture, picture frames, metalwork and other decorative arts. In describing vessels and similar shapes in pottery, metalwork and related fields, \"cavetto\" may be used of a variety of concave curves running round objects. The word comes from Italian, as a diminutive of \"cave\", from the Latin for \"hollow\" (it is the same root as cave). A vernacular alternative is \"cove\", most often used where interior walls curve at the top to make a transition to the roof, or for \"upside down\" cavettos at the bases of elements. \n\nThe cavetto moulding is the opposite of the convex, bulging, ovolo, which is equally common in the tradition of Western classical architecture. Both bring the surface forward, and are often combined with other elements of moulding. Usually they include a curve through about a quarter-circle (90°). A concave moulding of about a full semi-circle is known as a \"scotia\".\n\nOnly a minor element of decoration in classical architecture, the prominent cavetto cornice is a common feature of the ancient architecture of Egypt and the Ancient Near East.\n\nAncient Egyptian architecture made especial use of large cavetto mouldings as a cornice, with only a short fillet (plain vertical face) above, and a torus moulding (convex semi-circle) below. This cavetto cornice is sometimes also known as an \"Egyptian cornice\", \"hollow and roll\" or \"gorge cornice\", and has been suggested to be a reminiscence in stone architecture of the primitive use of bound bunches of reeds as supports for buildings, the weight of the roof bending their tops out. \nMany types of Egyptian capitals for columns are essentially cavettos running round the shaft, often with added decoration. These include the types known as \"bell capitals\" or \"papyrus capitals\". These features are often reproduced in Egyptian Revival architecture, as in the Egyptian Building (1845) in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThe cavetto cornice, often forming less than a quarter-circle, influenced Egypt's neighbours and as well as appearing in early Greek architecture, it is seen in Syria and ancient Iran, for example at the Tachara palace of Darius I at Persepolis, completed in 486 BC. Inspired by this precedent, it was then revived by Ardashir I (r. 224–41 AD), the founder of the Sasanian dynasty. \n\nThe cavetto took the place of the Greek cymatium in many Etruscan temples, often painted with vertical \"tongue\" patterns, and combined with the distinctive \"Etruscan round moulding\", often painted with scales. \nThis emphasis on the cavetto was very different from its role in mature Ancient Greek architecture, where cavetto elements were relatively small and subordinated to essentially vertical elements, setting the style for the subsequent Western classical tradition. Often an essentially cavetto section is heavily decorated, in Gothic architecture often smothering the shape beneath. \n\nIn general the Greeks made much more use of the cyma moulding, where a cavetto and ovolo were placed one above the other to produce a \"S\" shape; the cymatium using this was a standard part of the cornice in the classical Ionic order, and often used elsewhere. There are two forms, depending on which curve is uppermost: in the \"cyma recta\" the cavetto is on top, in the \"cyma reversa\" the ovolo. A cavetto alone was sometimes employed in the place of the cymatium of a cornice, as in the Doric order of the Theatre of Marcellus in Rome, one of the standard models for revived classical architecture from the Renaissance onwards. But small cavetto mouldings were normal at various places, including integrated ones, not distinguished as a distinct zone by lines or borders, at the bottom of the shaft of columns, beginning the transition to the wider base. These are called an apophyge, or \"concave sweep\". \n\nClaude Perrault, the architect of Louis XIV's rebuilding of the Louvre Palace, explained in his architectural textbook \"Ordonnance for the five kinds of columns after the method of the Ancients\" (1683) why he had replaced a cavetto with a cyma in his illustration of the Doric capital: \"a cavetto is not as strong and is more readily broken than the other molding\".\n\nIn plates and other flattish shapes, \"cavetto\" is used for the curving area linking the base and the rim. This is the case whether the rim is a broad flat surface (typical 20th century Western plate), or merely the edge of the cavetto (typical modern cereal bowl). Normally the term refers to the top surface of the vessel; if the underside is meant (where the curve is now convex), that may be described as \"under the cavetto\", \"under-cavetto\" and so forth. \n\nThe cavetto is very often left undecorated, but may have decoration of a different sort from the middle or a flat rim, and the term is typically used when it is necessary to describe this. In complicated pottery shapes, where the normal vocabulary of mouldings is appropriate, cavetto may be used in that sense for any concave curving section. \n\nIn the terminology of archaeology, especially relating to pottery (and generally not used of pottery after antiquity, or outside archaeology), a cavetto zone or cavetto is a \"sharp concavity encircling the body of a vessel\", and also a \"deep but narrow neck\", both used in relation to mainly upright vessels for storing or cooking food. \n\n"}
{"id": "19599415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19599415", "title": "Cindy Campbell", "text": "Cindy Campbell\n\nCindy Campbell is a fictional character from the \"Scary Movie\" franchise. Portrayed by Anna Faris and created by Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Buddy Johnson, Phil Beauman, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the character first appeared in \"Scary Movie\" (2000). In the film, whose main parodies are the \"Scream\" and \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" franchises, Cindy shares a role similar to Sidney Prescott and Julie James.\n\nFaris would reprise her role of Cindy in the film's sequels. In \"Scary Movie 2\", Cindy is attending college and with her friends, goes to Hell House for Professor Oldman's experiment. Here, her role is based on Eleanor from \"The Haunting\". In \"Scary Movie 3\", where her role is based on Rachel Keller from \"The Ring\", she is portrayed as a news presenter and has a nephew, Cody. After seeing Tabitha's cursed tape, she tries to stop her before seven days pass and she dies. In \"Scary Movie 4\", Cindy parodies Karen Davis from \"The Grudge\" and attempts to stop the alien attack with the help of Brenda.\n\nUp until the fourth installment, Faris and Regina Hall, who portrayed Brenda Meeks, were the only cast members to appear in every installment of the franchise. Faris didn't return for \"Scary Movie 5\" and Cindy was replaced by Ashley Tisdale's character; Jody Sanders. Critical response to Faris' portrayal has been positive.\n\nCindy is a high school student attending B. A. Corpse High School with her boyfriend Bobby Prinze. Their friends include Brenda Meeks, Buffy Gilmore, Ray Wilkins and Greg Phillipe. Despite being in a committed relationship with Bobby, the two of them still haven't consummated their relationship. Following Drew Decker's death, it's revealed that one year prior, the six of them had accidentally ran over a man while drinking. While the man was unharmed, they didn't notice and after accidentally knocking him unconscious, dumped his body at a pier. Later the same day, she notices Ghostface outside her classroom and a note on her desk telling her that \"they know what she did last Halloween\". After being attacked by Ghostface, she assumes that Bobby is the killer and gets him arrested. After the real killer calls her, she decides to invite her friends to keep each other safe. Thanks to Shorty, the small get-together turns into a party. After having sex with Bobby, it's revealed that he is gay and in a relationship with Ray. Despite killing Shorty, they reveal to her that they're copycats of the real killer who appears and kills both of them. After knocking him out, Cindy is taken to the police station where she realizes Doofy, Buffy's brother, is the killer. Despite running after him, Doofy manages to escape, leaving Cindy screaming in the middle of the street, only to get ran over by a car.\n\nOne year after the events of the previous film, Cindy is attending college with Brenda, Shorty and Ray, despite all three of them having died in the previous film and the latter having tried to kill her.\n\nNow a journalist, Cindy has custody of her paranormally gifted nephew, Cody. She again meets Brenda, now a teacher. Unnerved, Brenda asks Cindy to stay with her for the night, when she says she watched a cursed tape. Brenda is murdered by a supernatural girl named Tabitha after failing to turn off the TV. Cindy goes after the answer to the curse of the tape, discovering that aliens are also involved, all while trying to protect Cody and her new friends, Logan, his daughter and Cindy's love interest, George. After breaking the curse, she marries George.\n\nIn \"Scary Movie\", Cindy is a parody of Sidney Prescott from \"Scream\" and Julie James from \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\". Her first name is a play on Sidney, while her last name is taken from Neve Campbell, who portrayed Sidney in the \"Scream\" franchise.\n\nIn an interview with \"People\", it was revealed that Anna Faris beat out about hundreds of actresses who auditioned for the role of Cindy. Keenen Ivory Wayans, director of the first two films, said about Faris that \"there was a great freshness about her, because [she] had nothing to lose. She didn't think in a million years she was going to get the part\".\n\nFaris revealed that \"Scary Movie\" was her first Hollywood audition and that she highly enjoyed working on the franchise as it allowed her to be funny, feeling that female characters aren't often allowed to be funny in films. Additionally, she stated that one of the things she like about the franchise is that \"[they] can spoof whatever [they want,] take what's popular at the moment and slide it into a very complicated plot structure\".\n\nBruce G. Hallenbeck, in his book \"Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914–2008\", described Faris as \"the real discovery of \"Scary Movie\", the one performer who tries valiantly to hold everything together\".\n"}
{"id": "30247481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30247481", "title": "Commercial graffiti", "text": "Commercial graffiti\n\nCommercial graffiti (also known as aerosol advertising or graffiti for hire) is the commercial practice of graffiti artists being paid for their work. In New York City in particular, commercial graffiti is big business and since the 1980s has manifested itself in many of the major cities of Europe such as London, Paris and Berlin. Increasingly it has been used to promote video games and even feature prominently within them, reflecting a real life struggle between street artists and the law. Commercial graffiti has created significant controversy between those who view it as an effective medium of advertising amongst specific target audiences and those who believe that legal graffiti and advertising using it encourages illegal graffiti and crime.\n\nGraffiti as a commercial activity dates back to Ancient Greece, when pottery makers employed artists to decorate their items with motifs and intricate designs. The modern era, the phenomenon has been strongly associated with New York City since the late 1960s and the hip hop culture that emerged in the 1980s, according to a 1993 \"New York Times\" article that focused on the issue. The term \"commercial graffiti\" was used in an article by \"Time\" as early as 1968 and used to describe activity in Chicago as early as 1970. In 1981, Times Square was referenced as featuring \"commercial graffiti\" through \"Japanization\", and more recently further \"Japanization\" of children's culture is cited to be taking place through forms of graffiti in video games and in the increasing popularity of Japanese innovations such as anime. Since the early 1980s, commercial graffiti has evidenced itself in Los Angeles and other major American cities and across Europe, particularly Paris, and London and Berlin and features on the walls of numerous galleries across Europe.\n\nWith the increasing popularity and legitimization of graffiti, it has increasingly undergone commercialization. In 2001, computer giant IBM launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a peace symbol, a heart, and a penguin (Linux mascot), to represent \"Peace, Love, and Linux.\" However, due to illegalities some of the street artists were arrested and charged with vandalism, and IBM was fined more than US$120,000 for punitive and clean-up costs.\n\nThe practice of commercial artistry is controversial, because many commercial establishments feel that professional graffiti art is a valuable form of advertising, while other businesses, law enforcement and others disagree. Legal and commercial graffiti is increasing and has created significant debate amongst graffiti writers and those associated with hip-hop culture. The primary concern by those who oppose graffiti is that the tolerance of professional graffiti in one space leads to more illegal graffiti in other spaces. In some areas such as sports, over advertising in sports venues and even player uniforms in soccer has sometimes been viewed negatively.\n\nCommercial graffiti, seen as a frontier between the street world and the art world, is argued in some cases to promote a more responsible lifestyle for the graffiti artist through formal employment, which may range from actual graffiti advertising on buildings, to making prints and logos for clothing and gallery showcasing. Nancy MacDonland in her book \"The graffiti subculture: youth, masculinity, and identity in London and New York\" argues that commercial graffiti artistry \"moves writers out of the boundaries of the subculture\", because artists \"no longer paint for their peers and themselves, they have a new audience\".\n\nEven in major cities such as New York City and Chicago, commercial graffiti has created some very mixed reactions. For instance in Chicago, despite a significant following in graffiti artistry, in the mid 1980s a commercial which featured a kid spraying \"The end is near\" caused considerable outrage by Chicago citizens who protested to the Ford Motor Company to take the commercial off air as they believed it encouraged children to freely graffiti property as they desire. Similarly, in 2005, Peter Vallone Jr., a City Council member in New York and several other councilors protested against Sony's decision to use graffiti commercially in their PlayStation Portable advertising in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Miami as they believed it would have a negative influence on children and encourage them to deface property.\n\nIn New York City, legal graffiti and employment has become big business, appearing with owners' permission on everything from walls to railroad boxcars. According to Cooper and Sciorra, many young graffiti artists are keen to use their talents and aspire to achieve entrepreneurial success. Local businesses employing well-known graffiti artists are also said to enhance their credibility and business-customer relationship as well as reducing crime by employment. One prominent group in New York City is the \"King of Murals\" which run a commercial graffiti business and have been employed to promote global brands such as Coca-Cola and M&M's in advertising campaigns and even hired by schools, hospitals and other healthcare groups to create artwork. Bronx-based TATS CRU has made a name for themselves doing legal advertising campaigns for companies like Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Toyota, and MTV. Smirnoff and even Microsoft have hired artists to use reverse graffiti (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product. In 2011, Klughaus Gallery started Graffiti USA, a company offering interior graffiti murals for companies. Their work includes murals at the corporate offices of Linked In, Facebook, MasterCard, and ABC News, which featured a Graffiti USA commissioned mural on October 8, 2014 episode of Nightline.\n\nIn Boston, Massachusetts, a company named Alt Terrain specializes in hiring graffiti writers to paint legal murals as part of public performances which are hyped as \"brand events\" and may cost up to $12,500 for live performances. In Pittsfield, Massachusetts for example, after the death of Michael Jackson, Solomon \"Disco\" Stewart and a team of four artists named \"The Berkshire Graffiti Network\" for instance were paid to paint a \"Michael Jackson Tribute\" mural on the wall of a Pittsfield market on North Street.\nIn the United Kingdom, Covent Garden's Boxfresh used stencil images of a Zapatista revolutionary in the hopes of cross referencing would promote their store. Even the Israeli West Bank barrier has acted as a canvas for professional graffiti for hire teams. One Palestinian pacifist group will spray paint any message for 30 Euros, providing that it is not racist or violently motivated. The Art Crimes website is the first to be established in the field of commercial graffiti and hires some sixty artists to produce artwork.\n\nGraffiti has become an important part of video game culture, often reflecting the oppression facing graffiti artists in public and battle for it to be seen by the establishment as a legitimate and indeed a legal art form. The \"Jet Set Radio\" series (2000–2003) tells the story of a group of teens fighting the oppression of a totalitarian police force that attempts to limit the graffiti artists' freedom of speech and others such as \"Rakugaki Ōkoku\" series (2003–2005) for Sony's PlayStation 2 revolves around an anonymous hero and his magically imbued-with-life graffiti creations as they struggle against an evil king who only allows art to be produced which can benefit him. Similarly \"\" (2006), features a story line involving training in graffiti artistry and fighting against a corrupt city and its oppression of free speech, as in the \"Jet Set Radio\" series. Numerous other non-graffiti-centric video games allow the player to produce graffiti, such as the \"Half-Life\" series, the \"Tony Hawk's\" series, \"\", \"Rolling\" and \"\".\n\nGraffiti has become a common stepping stone for many members of both the art and design community in North America and abroad. Within the United States, graffiti artists such as Mike Giant, Pursue, Rime, Noah and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8 Osiris or Circa Meanwhile, there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, The Mac etc. which have developed into gallery artists and at times do not even use their initial medium (spray paint) to produce artwork.\n\nKeith Haring, a well-known graffiti artist, contributed to bringing graffiti to the commercial mainstream. In the 1980s, Haring opened his first Pop Shop: a store that offered everyone access to his works—which until then could only be found spray-painted on city walls. Pop Shop offered commodities like bags and T-shirts. Haring explained that, \"The Pop Shop makes my work accessible. It's about participation on a big level, the point was that we didn't want to produce things that would cheapen the art. In other words, this was still art as statement\". Marc Ecko, an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that \"Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career.\"\n\nBut perhaps the greatest example of graffiti artists infiltrating mainstream pop culture is by the French crew, 123Klan. 123Klan founded as a graffiti crew in 1989 by Scien and Klor, have gradually turned their hands to illustration and design while still maintaining their graffiti practice and style. In doing so they have designed and produced, logos and illustrations, shoes, and fashion for numerous global firms.\n\nMost of the major cities across the world have graffiti and street art tours, often run by local graffiti artists who want to bring their talent to the public on a more socially accepted level.\n\nOriginally started with walking or biking tours around the cities, street art tours have expanded to include graffiti workshops, using graffiti art tools, stencils and spray cans.\n\nTours exist in New York, London, Berlin, Hamburg, Reykjavik, Barcelona, Montreal and Paris.\n\nCommercial graffiti is used as a type of marketing known as guerrilla marketing where one company has limited funds for advertising its product may it be goods or services. Generally done by smaller companies at the beginning due to small budgets but adopted by big brands (e.g. Coca-Cola). This type of marketing has a way of going viral as it is done in a public place with limited resources but with new technology such as smart phones which can upload pictures and videos instantly to social media, so if there is legal permission by the government for graffiti people would do it during peak hours in communities for maximum exposure( Navrátilová, L. Milichovský, F(2015)).\n"}

It is a version of marquetry where art forms are made by decorating the surface of wooden articles with delicate pieces of wood, bone and metal precisely-cut intricate geometric patterns. Khatam-kari () or khatam-bandi () refers to the art of crafting a khatam. Common materials used in the construction of inlaid articles are gold, silver, brass, aluminum and twisted wire.\n\nDesigning of inlaid articles is a highly elaborate process. There are sometimes more than 400 pieces per square inch in a work of average quality. In each cubic centimeter of inlaid work, up to approximately 250 pieces of metal, bone, ivory and different kinds of wood are laid side by side, glued together in stages, smoothed, oiled and polished. Inlaid articles in the Safavid era took on a special significance as artists created their precious artworks. Woods used include betel, walnut, cypress and pine. These works include doors and windows, mirror frames, Quran boxes, inlaid boxes, pen and penholders, lanterns and shrines.\n\nThe ornamentation of the doors of holy places predominantly consists of inlaid motifs. Samples of these can be observed in the cities of Mashhad, Qom, Shiraz and Rey. In the Safavid era, the art of marquetry flourished in the southern cities of Iran, especially in Isfahan, Shiraz and Kerman. The inlaid-ornamented rooms at the Saadabad Palace and the Marble Palace in Tehran are among masterpieces of this art.\n\nKhatam is practiced in Isfahan, Shiraz and Tehran. The art of inlaid and sudorific woodwork is undertaken in the workshops of the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran, as well as in private workshops.\n\nMaster Mohammad Bagher Hakim-Elahi (محمد باقرحكيم الهي) was a master of this art, and learned the techniques from Master Sanee Khatam in Shiraz. Later in life, in early 1950's, he moved to Tehran, where he lived until the end of his life in March 2012. He continued making Khatam master pieces, ranging from small frames, and jewelry boxes, to large items such as coffee tables, bed frames, dinner tables, and large chandeliers, some of which are currently in Museums in Iran, but most are in private collection all around the world, including southern California. He also taught the art to his younger brother Asadolah Hakim-Elahi (ﺍﺴﺪﷲ ﺤﻛﻴﻢﺍﻠﻬﻰ). Asadolah died from lymphoma in the late 1970s when he was in his mid 40s.\n"}

{"id": "30654493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30654493", "title": "Learned pig", "text": "Learned pig\n\nThe learned pig was a pig taught to respond to commands in such a way that it appeared to be able to answer questions by picking up cards in its mouth. By choosing cards it answered arithmetical problems and spelled out words. The \"learned pig\" caused a sensation in London during the 1780s. It became a common object of satire, illustrated in caricatures and referred to in literature.\n\nThe original \"learned pig\" was followed by other trained pigs, which subsequently became a feature of fairs and other public attractions in Europe and America during the 19th century. In the words of G.E. Bentley, \"They served as subjects for cartoons by Rowlandson and moral essays in children's books and savage doggerel by Blake, and they illustrated the manners of the English in works by Joseph Strutt and Robert Southey and Thomas Hood. These freaks of learning clearly exercised a fascination among the literary geniuses of the age as they did among the swinish multitude.\"\n\nThe original Learned Pig was trained by a Scotsman Samuel Bisset, who ran a travelling novelty show. The idea of an \"intellectual\" animal was not new. A similar attraction known as \"Marocco the thinking horse\" (c.1586–c.1606) had been exhibited over a century earlier; there were also contemporary examples of the \"horse of knowledge\", exhibited for example at Astley's Amphitheatre. But performing horses were nothing unusual. No performing pigs are known to have been trained before.\n\nThe pig was shown with great success in Dublin. After Bisset's death the pig was taken over by a Mr Nicholson, who toured it in Britain. It was exhibited in Nottingham in 1784, coming to London in the following year.\" According to publicity at the time,\n\nThis entertaining and sagacious animal casts accounts by means of Typographical cards, in the same manner as a Printer composes, and by the same method sets down any capital or Surname, reckons the number of People present, tells by evoking on a Gentleman's Watch in company what is the Hour and Minutes; he likewise tells any Lady's Thoughts in company, and distinguishes all sorts of colours.\n\nThe show was a great success, and the pig later toured the provincial towns, returning to London later in the year and then moving on to the continent of Europe. After a career of four years a report stated that the pig died in 1788. However, a later report claimed that it had just returned from France following the revolution of 1789, and was ready to \"discourse on the Feudal System, the Rights of Kings and the Destruction of the Bastille\".\n\nThe phenomenon caused much comment. James Boswell recalls conversations with Samuel Johnson in which he joked about the pig's scholarship. Johnson never saw the pig. He died just before it came to London, but he commented on a report of its show in Nottingham. He suggested that \"the pigs are a race unjustly calumniated. \"Pig\" has, it seems, not been wanting to \"man\", but \"man\" to \"pig\". We do not allow \"time\" for his education, we kill him at a year old.\" Another man present joked that Alexander Pope would not have used the pig as a symbol of \"the lowest degree of grovelling instinct\" in his works if this creature had been known to him, but added that the pig had probably been subject to some form of torture to force it to respond to commands. Johnson replied that at least it had escaped slaughter: \"the pig has no cause to complain; he would have been killed the first year if he had not been \"educated\", and protracted existence is a good recompence for very considerable degrees of torture.\"\n\nThe discussion about how the pig had been trained also led to disputes about the cognitive abilities of pigs; whether the animal actually recognised letters or even words, or whether it was simply responding to direct prompting. The phenomenon was also discussed in instructional literature aimed at children, to describe the essential difference between human and animal capacities and to warn against cruelty to animals, on the assumption that the pigs were badly beaten by their trainers to force them to behave. Mrs Trimmer in her children's book \"The Robin Redbreasts\" (1788), \"designed to teach children the proper treatment of animals\", mentions the pig in chapter entitled \"The Cruel Boy\": aiming to teach that animals are not \"mere machines, actuated by the unerring hand of Providence\", it says that the sight of the Learned Pig, \"which has lately been shown in London, has deranged these ideas, and I know not what think\".\n\nIn 1798 a learned pig appeared in the United States. William Frederick Pinchbeck displayed a \"Pig of Knowledge\" in New England. He claimed to have toured all the major towns of the Union and introduced the pig to President John Adams, to \"universal applause\". Pinchbeck later explained his methods of training the pig in a pamphlet. He denied that any form of torture was involved, insisting that it was better to \"coax\" the pig to follow instructions. The animal would soon learn to respond to the slightest hints of movement from the trainer. He stated that credulous spectators accused him of using witchcraft, one stating that \"his performances were the effects of the Black Art; that the Pig ought to be burnt, and the Man banished, as he had no doubt but...[his trainer] familiarly corresponded with the devil.\" Others suggested that the pig was evidence of reincarnation: \"the spirit of the grunting philosopher might once have animated a man.\"\n\nIn the early 19th century, Nicholas Hoare, an illusionist, exhibited \"Toby the sapient pig\" in London. Toby could \"discover a person’s thoughts\", a skill \"never heard of before to be exhibited by an animal of the swine race\". Around 1817 Toby also published an autobiography, \"The life and adventures of Toby, the sapient pig: with his opinions on men and manners. Written by himself\".\n\nA pig owned by Pinchbeck was shown in London between 1818 and 1823. According to his publicity, the pig had acquired his wisdom from \"Souchanguyee, the Chinese Philosopher.\" He answered questions by \"pointing to cards, letters, and persons in the audience.\"\n\n\"Toby\" became a standard name for a learned pig. The writer Harrison Weir depicts a learned pig called Toby, which he saw a \"year ago at Camberwell Fair\" for a penny. According to Harrison, the pig carried a correctly numbered card to a person who had called out a number; it spelled \"vittels,\" and then it left to have some, \"with a joyful grunt, and the show was over.\"\n\nThe original learned pig inspired a large number of satirical comments and comic prints. Thomas Rowlandson published a caricature of \"The Wonderful Pig\" in 1785, in which the pig is shown displaying his erudition to a crowd of amazed ladies and gentlemen. A placard states \"The Surprising PIG well versed in all Languages, perfect Arethmatician Mathematician & Composer of Musick.\"\n\nOther caricatures used the appeal of the pig to poke fun at theatrical fads of the day. \"The Theatrical War\" satirises the actor-impresario John Palmer, dressed in Shakespearean costume, being threatened by other attractions including the pig.\n\nThe 1784 print \"The Downfall of Taste and Genius, or, The World As it Goes\" by Samuel Collings ridicules \"the taste that prefers the Dancing Dogs, the Learned Pig, and Harlequin to Shakespeare\". This was a \"recurrent theme\" of prints at the time. The print depicts the pig leading a procession of performing animals who knock over figures representing the fine arts while copies of Shakespeare's and Pope's works are trampled underfoot by the animals.\n\nAn anonymous print entitled \"The Wonderful Pig of Knowledge\" shows a pig performing in a parlour apparently engaged in spelling the word \"PORC[INE]\"\n\nPoliticians were also satirised by being compared to the pig. William Pitt was referred to as \"the Wonderful Pig\" on several occasions. One satirical print showed Pitt with the body of a pig; the caption asserted that among his powers was the ability to explain recent Acts of Parliament, a feat \"before never having been even \"attempted\" in these our realms!!!\" In one print Pitt and his opponent Charles James Fox were both depicted as competing learned pigs.\n\nThe concept of the \"learned pig\" became a common motif in satirical literature by the late 18th century, playing on the implied contrast between gross physicality and intellectual superiority. The poet William Cowper lamented that his fame had been unfavourably compared to both the pig and a \"prostitute\" (the notoriously promiscuous actress Anne Bellamy). A poem published in 1785 referred to the fact that the pig had arrived in London just after Johnson's death,\n\nThe anonymous pamphlet \"The Story of the Learned Pig, By an officer of the Royal Navy\" (1786) picked up the theme of reincarnation. This presents itself as the personal reminiscences of the pig, as told to the author. He describes himself as a soul that has successively migrated from the body of Romulus into various humans and animals before becoming the Learned Pig. He recalls his previous incarnations. After Romulus he became Brutus, and then entered several human and animal bodies. Adapting the Shakespeare theme, the pamphlet states that he became a man called \"Pimping Billy\", who worked as a horse-holder at a playhouse with Shakespeare and was the real author of his plays. He then became a famous British aristocrat and general — identified only by asterisks — before entering the body of a pig.\n\nPuns on the name \"Bacon\", referring to the philosopher Francis Bacon, also appeared in the literature. In the poem \"The Prophetic Pig\", in \"The Whim of the Day\" (c.1794) a believer in reincarnation states, \"I can easily trace...A metempsychosis in this pig's face!...And in transmigration, if I'm not mistaken,/This learned pig must be, by consanguinity,/Descended from the great Lord Bacon.\" Thomas Hood's poem \"The Lament of Toby, The Learned Pig\" also uses the Bacon pun, adding another on the poet James Hogg. He describes the thoughts of a learned pig forced to retire from his intellectual pursuits to be fattened for slaughter. The pig says \"Goodbye to the poetic Hogg!/The philosophic Bacon!\":\n\nWilliam Blake attacked debased public taste in a poem dedicated to the artist James Barry, writing that the nation which neglected Barry might \"give pensions to the Learned Pig / Or the Hare playing on a Tabor\". He also alludes to it in his satire \"An Island in the Moon\". In 1807 Robert Southey parodied the contrast between real genius and meretricious celebrity by referring to the pig, noting that \"the learned pig was in his day a far greater object of admiration to the English nation than ever was Sir Isaac Newton.\" William Wordsworth refers to the pig in \"The Prelude\", describing it as one of the \"freaks of nature\" to be seen at Bartholomew Fair:\n\nThe pig continued to be a common reference point for writers, mentioned by Mary Wollstonecraft and Charles Dickens among others. In \"The Mudfog Papers\" Dickens describes a moving lecture given at the \"Mudfog Society for the Advancement of Everything\" by Mr Blunderum on the dying moments of the learned pig. The lecturer was asked whether the learned pig was related to the Pig-faced Lady, causing embarrassment to an audience member who \"was\" related to the lady, but who refused to admit a family connection to the learned pig.\n\nEven Mrs Beeton begins her recipe for cooking sucking pig with the observation that pigs are capable of \"education\" \"and though, like the ass, naturally stubborn and obstinate, that he is equally amenable with other animals to caresses and kindness\". This is proven by \"the instance of the learned pig, first exhibited about a century since, but which has been continued down to our own time by repeated instances of an animal who will put together all the letters or figures that compose the day, month, hour and date of the exhibition, besides many other unquestioned evidences of memory.\"\n\nMost recently, the \"Learned Pig\" has made a reappearance of sorts in popular culture; in 2003 he was the subject of a song, \"The Learned Pig,\" which was part of a concept concert and recording by the UK band the Tiger Lillies, based on a poem by Edward Gorey. The musical \"Toby the Incredible Learned Pig\", written by Daniel Freedman, was a finalist in the Wonderland One Act Festival at Theater Works 42nd St. NYC in 2007. In 2011 there appeared a novel, \"Pyg: The Memoirs of a Learned Pig\", by Russell Potter, based on the career of the original \"Toby\". ()\n\n"}
{"id": "56624093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56624093", "title": "Libro de' Disegni", "text": "Libro de' Disegni\n\nThe Libro de' Disegni (Italian for \"Book of Drawings\") was a collection of drawings gathered, sorted and grouped by Giorgio Vasari whilst writing his \"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\". By the time of his death in 1574 it is thought to have contained around 526 drawings, of which 162 are now in the Louvre and 83 in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm. There are also drawings from the \"Libro\" in the prints and drawings departments of the Uffizi, the British Museum, the Albertina, the National Gallery of Art and other institutions.\n\nSome art historians believe they were gathered to illustrate Vasari's \"Lives\" directly, as a visual index of the artists' works, whilst others believe it was a separate document in its own right. In his preface to the \"Lives\", Vasari described his reasons for writing:\nNo text reveals why Vasari compiled his collection of drawings, but it was probably to illustrate the styles of the different artists he wrote about and to show how he had divided them \"into three parts, or rather let us call them periods, between the rebirth of the arts and our own time - each of these is distinguished from the others by manifest differences\". The earliest drawing in the collection was by Cimabue and the latest dated to Vasari's own time. In the 1550 and 1568 editions of the \"Lives\" Vasari insisted on drawings as documents which allowed the viewer to perceive the \"maniera\" of the great masters of painting and mentioned when he owned one or two drawings by a particular artist, such as at the end of his life of Filippo Lippi:\n(\"Fra Filippo drew very well, as one can see in my own \"Libro\" of the most famous painters, in the preparatory drawings for the altarpiece at Santo Spirito and the frescoes in the Prato chapel.\") and in his life of Sandro Botticelli (\"Sandro's drawings were of a totally unique excellence; and, after his death, more and more artists have been keen to have some of his drawings; and I myself, in my collection, have a few which were done with great care and judgement\").\n\nGiorgio Vasari was one of the founders of the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno set up in Florence by Cosimo I of Tuscany in 1563. He and the other founders wished to use this academy to promote artists above the status of artisans. He was also a passionate collector of drawings and in his \"Libro\" he set them in his own paper frames and gathered drawings by one or more painters on a single sheet. In 1528 he received a collection of Lorenzo Ghiberti's drawings, as one of Ghiberti's descendents.\n\nAfter Vasari's death, the sheets of the \"Libro\" were initially bought in 1574 by the Florentine collector Niccolò Gaddi (1537-1591). They were then sold by Gaddi's heirs before 18 May 1638, the date of death of Lorenzo Sabbatini, who had been put in charge of the \"Libro\". They were then dispersed among the Medici, Arundel, Quesnel, Crozat and Mariette collections during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe first drawings from the \"Libro de' Disegni\" to enter the French national collection were bought by Everhard Jabach, probably when the Arundel collections were sold in 1646 and 1654 after his and his widow's deaths. They then passed from Jabach into Louis XIV's drawings collection in 1671. Further sheets from the \"Libro\" were added when the French royal collection bought part of the collection of Mariette in 1755 and when Saint-Morys's collection was seized by the revolutionary government in 1793. These later additions may have originated in the sale of the Crozat collection, for which a catalogue survives. Part of the Mariette collection was sold to the royal collection in 1775. Other pages entered the French national collection from émigré goods seized by the revolutionary government and via gift and purchase.\n\nThe museum acquired 83 drawings from the \"Libro\" as part of the Pierre Crozat and Carl Gustaf Tessin collections. They include Domenico Ghirlandaio's \"\", a study for his 1490 painting \"An Old Man and his Grandson\", now in the Louvre.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "191936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191936", "title": "Oil lamp", "text": "Oil lamp\n\nAn oil lamp is an object used to produce light continuously for a period of time using an oil-based fuel source. The use of oil lamps began thousands of years ago and continues to this day, although not commonly anymore. \n\nOil lamps are a form of lighting, and were used as an alternative to candles before the use of electric lights. Starting in 1780, the Argand lamp quickly replaced other oil lamps still in their basic ancient form. These in turn were replaced by the kerosene lamp in about 1850. In small towns and rural areas the latter continued in use well into the 20th century, until such areas were finally electrified and light bulbs could be used.\n\nSources of fuel for oil lamps include a wide variety of plants such as nuts (walnuts, almonds) and seeds (sesame, olive, castor, flax). Also widely used were animal fats (butter, fish oil, shark liver, whale blubber, seals). \n\nMost modern lamps (such as fueled lanterns) have been replaced by gas-based or petroleum-based fuels to operate when emergency non-electric light is required. Therefore, oil lamps of today are primarily used for the particular ambience they produce.\n\nThe following are the main external parts of a terra-cotta lamp:\n\n\nLamps can be categorized based on different criteria, including material (clay, silver, bronze, gold, stone, slip), shape, structure, design, and imagery (e.g. symbolic, religious, mythological, erotic, battles, hunting).\n\nTypologically, lamps of the Ancient Mediterranean can be divided into seven major categories:\n\nWheel-made: This category includes Greek and Egyptian lamps that date before the 3rd century BC. They are characterized by simple, little or no decoration, and a wide pour hole, a lack of handles, and a pierced or unpierced lug. Pierced lugs occurred briefly between 4th and 3rd century BC. Unpierced lugs continued until the 1st century BC.\n\nVolute, Early Imperial: With spiral, scroll-like ornaments (volutes) extending from their nozzles, these lamps were predominantly produced in Italy during the period. They have a wide discus, a narrow shoulder and no handle, elaborate imagery and artistic finishing, and a wide range of patterns of decoration.\n\nHigh Imperial: These are late Roman. The shoulder is wider and the discus is smaller with fewer decorations. These lamps have handles and short plain nozzles, and less artistic finishing.\n\nFrog: This is a regional style lamp exclusively produced in Egypt and found in the regions around it, between c. 100 and 300 AD. The frog (Heqet) is an Egyptian fertility symbol.\n\nAfrican Red Slip lamps were made in North Africa, but widely exported, and decorated in a red slip. They date from the 2nd to the 7th century AD and comprise a wide variety of shapes including a flat, heavily decorated shoulder with a small and relatively shallow discus. Their decoration is either non-religious, Christian or Jewish. Grooves run from the nozzle back to the pouring hole, it is hypothesized that this is to take back spilled oil. These lamps often have more than one pour-hole.\n\nSlipper lamps are oval-shaped and found mainly in the Levant. They were produced between the 3rd to 9th centuries AD.\nDecorations include vine scrolls, palm wreaths, and Greek letters.\n\nFactory lamps: Also called \"Firmalampen\" (from German), these are universal in distribution and simple in appearance. They have a channeled nozzle, plain discus, and 2 or 3 bumps on the shoulder. Initially made in factories in Northern Italy and Southern Gaul between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, they were exported to all Roman provinces. The vast majority were stamped on the bottom to identify the manufacturer.\n\nLamps appear in the Torah and other Jewish sources as a symbol of “lighting” the way for the righteous, the wise, and for love and other positive values. While fire was often described as being destructive, light was given a positive spiritual meaning. The oil lamp and its light were important household items, and this may explain their symbolism. Oil lamps were used for many spiritual rituals.\nThe oil lamp and its light also became important ritualistic articles with the further development of Jewish culture and its religion.\n\n\nThe Temple Menorah, a ritual seven-branched oil lamp used in the Second Temple, forms the centre of the Chanukah story and centers on the story of the miracle of the oil: During the cleansing of the Second Temple in Jerusalem after its looting, the lamp was supposed to burn continuously, forever, but there was only oil enough for one day, and no more oil would be available for eight days. Miraculously, however, the oil expected to last for only one day burnt for eight full days instead.\n\nThere are several references to oil lamps in the New Testament:\n\nThis story was told by Jesus: “At that time God’s kingdom will be like ten bridesmaids who went to wait for the bridegroom. They took their lamps with them. Five of the bridesmaids were foolish, and five were wise. The foolish bridesmaids took their lamps with them, but they did not take extra oil for the lamps. The wise bridesmaids took their lamps and more oil in jars. When the bridegroom was very late, the bridesmaids could not keep their eyes open, and they all fell asleep. At midnight someone announced, ‘The bridegroom is coming! Come and meet him!’ Then all the bridesmaids woke up. They made their lamps ready. But the foolish bridesmaids said to the wise girls, ‘Give us some of your oil. The oil in our lamps is all gone.’ The wise bridesmaids answered, ‘No! The oil we have might not be enough for all of us. But go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’ So the foolish bridesmaids went to buy oil. While they were gone, the bridegroom came. The bridesmaids who were ready went in with the bridegroom to the wedding feast. Then the door was closed and locked. Later, the other bridesmaids came. They said, ‘Sir, sir! Open the door to let us in.’ But the bridegroom answered, ‘Certainly not! I don’t even know you.’ So always be ready. You don’t know the day or the time when the Son of Man will come.\"\n\n\nIn the Orthodox Church and many Eastern Catholic Churches oil lamps (, Slavonic: \"lampada\") are still used both on the Holy Table (altar) and to illuminate icons on the iconostasis and around the temple (church building). Orthodox Christians will also use oil lamps in their homes to illuminate their icon corner.\n\nTraditionally, the sanctuary lamp in an Orthodox church is an oil lamp. It is lit by the bishop when the church is consecrated, and ideally it should burn perpetually thereafter. The oil burned in all of these lamps is traditionally olive oil.\n\nIn Greece and Cyprus, \"lampáda\" (Greek: λαμπάδα) is the special name for the candle held by the faithful on the Easter . Although any regular paraffin or beeswax candle can be used, a \"lampáda\" is usually a large, white candle or, in the case of children, a multicolored candle decorated with ribbons, beads, toys, dried flowers etc. The \"lampáda\" is lit at midnight, with the holy light from the priest's candle, and then carried home. The sign of the cross is often made with soot from this flame on the lintel above the home's main door, and the flame is transferred to the icon corner oil lamp; only then can the \"lampáda\" be extinguished. The cross over the door and the flame before the icons are believed to confer the Risen Lord's protection on the household.\n\nIn Eastern Christianity it is common to hang decorated ostrich eggs on the chains holding the oil lamps. The initial reason was probably to prevent mice and rats from climbing down the chain to eat the oil. Another, symbolical explanation is based in the fictitious tradition that female ostriches do not sit on their eggs, but stare at them incessantly until they hatch out, because if they stop staring even for a second the egg will addle. This is equated to the obligation of the Christian to direct his entire attention towards God during prayer, lest the prayer be fruitless.\n\n\"God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His light is, as it were, that of a niche containing a lamp; the lamp is [enclosed] in glass, the glass [shining] like a radiant star: [a lamp] lit from a blessed tree - an olive-tree that is neither of the east nor of the west the oil whereof [is so bright that it] would well-nigh give light [of itself] even though fire had not touched it: light upon light! God guides unto His light him that wills [to be guided]; and [to this end] God propounds parables unto men, since God [alone] has full knowledge of all things\". 24:35\n\n\"Mankind errs here<br>\nBy folly, darkening knowledge. But, for whom<br>\nThat darkness of the soul is chased by Light (of the Lord),<br>\nSplendid and clear shines manifest the Truth<br>\nAs if a Sun of Wisdom sprang to shed<br>\nIts beams of dawn. Him meditating still,<br>\nHim seeking, with Him blended, stayed on Him,<br>\nThe souls illuminated take that road<br>\nWhich hath no turning back—their sins flung off<br>\nBy strength of faith. Who will, may have this Light;<br>\nWho hath it, sees.\"—\"Bhagavad-Gita\", Ch: V, Lines 50-60.\n\nOil lamps are commonly used in Hindu temples as well as in home shrines. Generally the lamps used in temples are circular with places for five wicks. They are made of metal and either suspended on a chain or screwed onto a pedestal. There will usually be at least one lamp in each shrine, and the main shrine may contain several. Usually only one wick is lit, with all five burning only on festive occasions. The oil lamp is used in the Hindu ritual of Aarti.\n\nIn the home shrine, the style of lamp is usually different, containing only one wick. There is usually a piece of metal that forms the back of the lamp, which has a picture of a Hindu deity embossed on it. In many houses, the lamp burns all day, but in other homes, it is lit at sundown. The lamp in the home shrine is supposed to be lit before any other lights are turned on at night.\n\nA hand-held oil lamp or incense sticks (lit from the lamp) are also used during the Hindu puja ceremony. In the North of India, a five-wick lamp is used, usually fueled with ghee. On special occasions, various other lamps may be used for puja, the most elaborate having several tiers of wicks.\n\nIn South India, there are a few types of oil lamps that are common in temples and traditional rituals, some of the smaller ones are used for offerings as well:a \n\n\nOil lamps are lit at traditional Chinese shrines before either an image of a deity or a plaque with Classical Chinese characters giving the name of the deity. Such lamps are usually made from clear glass (they look similar to normal drinking glasses) and are filled with oil, sometimes with water underneath. A cork or plastic floater containing a wick is placed on top of the oil with the bottom of the wick submerged in the oil.\n\nSuch lamps are kept burning in shrines, whether private or public, and incense sticks or joss sticks are lit from the lamp.\n\nIt is very difficult to say when and where the first oil lamp was used. This is partly because it is difficult to draw a line detailing when the primitive forms of creating a continuous source of light from fire can be termed a lamp.\nThe first lamps were made of naturally occurring objects, coconuts, sea shells, egg shells and hollow stones. Some believe that the first proper lamps were carved from stones. Curved stone lamps were found in places dated to the 10th millennium BC (Mesolithic, Middle Stone Age Period, c. 10,300–8000 BC). The oldest stone-oil lamp was found in Lascaux in 1940 in a cave that was inhabited 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.\nSome archaeologists claim that the first shell-lamps were in existence more than 6,000 years ago (Neolithic, Later Stone Age, c. 8500–4500 BC). They believe that the alabaster shell-shaped lamps dug up in Sumerian sites dating 2600 BC were imitations of real shell-lamps that were used for a long time (Early Bronze, Canaanite / Bronze I-IV, c. 3300–2000 BC).\n\nIt is generally agreed that the evolution of handmade lamps moved from bowl-shaped to saucer-shaped, then from saucer with a nozzle, to a closed bowl with a spout.\n\nThe first manufactured red pottery oil lamps appeared. These were of the round bowl type.\n\nLamps were simple wheel-made bowls with a slight pinch on four sides for the wick. Later lamps had only one pinch. These lamps vary in the shape of the rim, the general shape of the bowl and the shape of the base.\n\nThe earliest lamps known from Intermediate Bronze Age lamps (EBIV/MBI)\nWith the four wick lamps. These lamps are made from large bowls with four shallow pinches for wicks.\nThe four-wick oil lamps persist into this period, most of the lamps now have one wick. Early in this period the pinch is shallow, while later on it becomes more prominent and the mouth protrudes from the lamp's body. The bases are simple and flat. The crude potter’s wheel is introduced, transforming the handmade bowls to a more uniform container. The saucer style evolves into a single spout shape.\nA more pronounced, deeper single spout is developed, and it is almost closed on the sides. The shape is evolving to be more triangular, deeper and larger. All lamps are now wheel-made. The base is simple, usually flat.\n\nThe rim becomes wider and flatter with a deeper and higher spout. The tip of the spout is more upright in contrast to the rest of the rim.\n\nThe lamps are becoming variable in shape and distribution. We still find lamps similar to the Late Bronze period. In addition, other forms evolve, such as small lamps with a flat base and larger lamps with a round base. The later form continues into the Iron Age II.\n\nIn the later Iron Age, we encounter variant forms. One common type is small, with a wide rim and a wide base. Another type is a small, shallow bowl with a thick and high discus base.\n\nThe seal-oil lamp \"(Qulliq)\" provided warmth and light in the harsh Arctic environment where there was no wood and where the sparse inhabitants relied almost entirely on seal oil. This lamp was the most important article of furniture for the Inuit, Yupik and other Eskimo peoples.\n\nThe lamps were made of stone and their sizes and shapes of lamps could be different, but mostly were elliptical or half-moon shaped. The wicks were mostly made of dried moss or cottongrass and was lit along the edge of the lamp. A slab of seal blubber could be left to melt over the lamp feeding it with more fat.\n\nThese large lamps have thin sides and a deep pinch, which flattens the mouth and makes it protrude outward.\n\nLamps are more closed to avoid spilling. They are smaller and more refined. Most are handleless. Some are with a lug, pierced and not pierced. The nozzle is elongated. The rim is folded over to make the nozzle, so it overlaps and is then pinched to make the wick hole.\n\nThey are round in shape, wheel-made.\n\nThe earliest Chinese oil lamps are dated from the Warring States period (481-221 BC). The ancient Chinese created oil lamps with a refillable reservoir and a fibrous wick, giving the lamp a controlled flame. Lamps were constructed from jade, bronze, ceramic, wood, stone, and other materials. The largest oil lamp excavated so far is one discovered in a 4th-century tomb located in modern Pingshan, Hebei.\n\nProduction of oil-lamps shifted to Italy as the main source of supply. Molds used. All lamps are closed in type. Lamps produced in large scale in factories. The lamp is produced in two parts, the upper part with the spout and the lower part with the fuel chamber. Most are of the characteristic Imperial Type. It was round with nozzles of different forms (volute, semi-volute, U shaped), with a closed body and with a central disk decorated with reliefs and its filling hole.\n\nThe High Imperial Type. More decorations. Produced locally or imported in large scale. The multiple-nozzled lamps appear. Different varieties.\n\nIn this period we find the frog type lamps. These are kidney or heart shaped or oval. With the motif of a frog or its abstraction, and sometimes with geometrical motifs. They were produced around 100 AD. They are so variant that it is seldom that two identical ones are found.\n\nSlipper shaped. Very decorative. The multiple nozzles continue. Most with handles. Some are complex in external anatomy.\n\nThere is a transition period from Byzantine to Islamic lamps. The decoration on lamps of this transition period changed from crosses, animals, human likenesses, birds, fish, etc., to plain linear, geometric, and raised-dot patterns.\n\nThe early Islamic lamps continued the traditions of Byzantine lamps. Decorations were initially a stylized form of bird, grain, tree, plant, or flower. Then they became entirely geometric or linear with raised dots.\n\nIn 9th-century Baghdad, al-Razi (Rhazes) described the first kerosene lamp; he referred to it as the \"naffatah\" in his \"Kitab al-Asrar\" (\"Book of Secrets\").\n\nIn the transition period some lamps had Arabic writing. Then writing disappears until the Mamluk period (13th to 15th centuries AD).\n\nOil-burning carriage lamps provided a model for the first bicycle lamps in the 1860s.\n\n\nIn Vedic times, fire was kept alive in every household in some form and carried with oneself while migrating to new locations. Later the presence of fire in the household or a religious building was ensured by an oil lamp. Over the years various rituals and customs were woven around an oil lamp.\n\nFor \"Deep Daan\", the gift of a lamp was and still is believed to be the best daan (donation). During marriages, spinsters of the household stand behind the bride and groom, holding an oil lamp to ward off evil. The presence of an oil lamp is an important aspect of ritual worship (the Shodashopachar Puja) offered to a deity. Moreover, a day is kept aside for the worship of the lamp in the busy festival calendar, on one amavasya (no moon) day in the month of Shravan. This reverence for the deep is based on the symbolism of the journey from darkness and ignorance to light and the knowledge of the ultimate reality – \"tamaso ma jyotirgamaya\".\n\nEarlier lamps were made out of stone or seashells. The shape was like a circular bowl with a protruding beak. Later they were replaced by earthen and metal lamps. In the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, there are references to gold and silver lamps as well. The simple shape evolved and the lamps were created in the shapes of the matsya (fish), kurma (Tortoise) and other incarnations of god Vishnu and also in the shape of the many emblems of gods like conch shells, lotuses and so on. The birds like swans, peacocks, parrots and animals like snakes, lions, elephants and horses were also favorites when decorating a lamp. For lighting multiple lamps, wooden and stone deepastambhas (towers of light) were created.\nErecting a deepastambha in front of a temple is still a general practice in western and southern India. In some of the South Indian temples, raised lamp towers called Kamba Vilakku made of brass can be seen. For adapting the design to households and smaller spaces, the deepavriksha (tree of light) was formed. As the name suggests, it is a metal lamp container with aesthetically curvi-linear lines branching out from the base each holding a lamp. The Deepalakshmi is another common design where goddess Lakshmi holds the lamp in her hands. Kuthuvilakku is another typical lamp traditionally used for household purposes in South India.\n\nOil lamps also became proverbial. For example, a Bradj (pre-Hindi) proverb says, \"Chiraag tale andhera\", \"the [utmost] darkness is under the oil-lamp (chiraag)\", meaning that what you seek could be close but unnoticed (right under your nose or feet), in various senses (and indeed, a lamp's container casts a strong shadow).\n\nWhen the Big Temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu was built, there were elaborate measures taken to provide lighting for the temple. Lands were donated to or conquered for the temple for this sole objective. The income from these lands would go towards providing the oil for the lights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24708120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24708120", "title": "Old Tibetan Chronicle", "text": "Old Tibetan Chronicle\n\nThe Old Tibetan Chronicle is a collection of narrative accounts and songs relating to Tibet's Yarlung dynasty and the Tibetan Empire. The three manuscripts that comprise the only extant copies of the Chronicle are among the Dunhuang Manuscripts found in the early 20th century in the so-called \"hidden library\" at the Mogao Grottoes near Dunhuang, which is believed to have been sealed in the 11th century CE. The \"Chronicle\", together with the Old Tibetan Annals comprise Tibet's earliest extant history.\n\nAn enormous number of early manuscripts in a variety of languages were collected by Aurel Stein and Paul Pelliot at the famous sealed-up Library Cave (no. 17) of the Mogao Grottoes at Dunhuang and sent back to London and Paris respectively. The \"Dunhuang manuscripts\" in the Tibetan language include the Old Tibetan Chronicle, which was probably compiled in the early 9th century, and the Old Tibetan Annals, which have been described as \"the first and single most important documents available on early Tibetan history.\"\n\nThe \"Old Tibetan Chronicle\" is extant in two manuscripts in the Pelliot Collection at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris, and some manuscript fragments. The main scroll comprises Pelliot tibétain 1286 and Pelliot tibétain 1287. The Tibetan text is written on the blank verso sides of panels pasted together from Chinese scrolls. In the first critical edition of Pelliot tibétain 1286 and Pelliot tibétain 1287, Jacques Bacot and Charles Toussaint considered them to be represent separate texts and referred to Pelliot tibétain 1286 as \"Principautés anciennes et généalogie des rois,\" but following the suggestion of Geza Uray, both are now considered to be two parts a single original manuscript and can be referred to together as the Old Tibetan Chronicle. In addition, two folios from a single original manuscript, Pelliot tibétain 1144 and IOL Tib J 1375, overlap with narratives found in the Chronicle, though differing in certain details.\n\nThe \"Old Tibetan Chronicle\" is a composite text of various lists, narratives and bardic songs arranged to form a single account of the reigns of the Tibetan emperors. As the list of the Tibetan emperors found in the narrative ends with U Dumten ('U'i dum brtan), later known as Langdarma, the \"Chronicle\" must have been compiled during or soon after the reign of this emperor, that is, in the 840s. Geza Uray has argued that this composition was made in Dunhuang itself rather than Central Tibet.\n\nThe Chronicle begins with a series of lists - of marriage alliances, principalities, emperors and ministers. The list of emperors is prefaced by an account of the descent of the first emperor Nyatri Tsenpo (gNya'-khri bTsan-po) from heaven, and ends with an account of the death of Drigum Tsenpo, the first mortal in the line. After this the Chronicle narrates the overthrow of the prince Zingpoje - this narrative is also represented in the fragmentary Version II of the Chronicle. The narrative then continues with an account of the following Tibetan emperors before coming to the reign of Songtsen Gampo (r. c.605–649). This section actually concentrates on the activities of the minister Khyungpo Pungse. The Chronicle then continues with a narrative of the following emperors, before coming to Trisong Detsen (r. 756-c.800), in which his victory over the rival Tibetan king Lig Myi-rhya is celebrated. The Chronicle then returns to the reign of an earlier emperor Tridu Songtsen (676-704), and his victory over a claim to rule Tibetan by the Gar clan.\n\nThe Chronicle does not offer a comprehensive account of the history of Tibet. This is partly because of the nature of its composition from earlier narratives and songs. It has also been argued by Lajos Ligeti and Geza Uray that the material in the Chronicle represents the interests of specific Tibetan clans, namely the Dba' and Myang clans (Ligeti adds the Mnon and Tshe-spong clans as well). In this it is comparable to another early Tibetan historical text, the Testament of Ba, which represents the interests of the Dba' clan. Contradicting later Tibetan Buddhist histories, neither the \"Annals\" nor the \"Chronicle\" make any mention of Buddhism in the reign of Songtsen Gampo. However, the \"Chronicle\" does say that, during the reign of king Trisong Detsen (Khri srong lde brtsan- ruled from 755 to 797 or 804 CE), \"The incomparable religion of the Buddha had been received and there were viharas (monasteries) in the centre as well as the borderlands of the country.\"\n\nIt has been clear since the Chronicle was first published that there are problems with its chronology. The victory over Lig Myi-rhya is narrated in the section on Trisong Detsen, yet in the victory song and the following narrative the emperor named is Songtsen Gampo, who ruled over a century earlier. Furthermore, the Chronicle ends in the reign of Tridu Songtsen (676-704), which should come between Songtsen Gampo and Trisong Detsen. There are two main theories regarding this anachronism. Ariane Macdonald and Yoshiro Imaeda have argued that the problems with chronology arose because the Chronicle was composed from a variety of different sources. Geza Uray on the other hand has argued that the scroll of Pelliot tibétain 1287 was cut up and rearranged some time after it was originally written, and the chronological problem results from this. He suggests that this later cutting and pasting may have been done specifically in order to associate the conquest of Lig Myi-rhya with the emperor Trisong Detsen, pointing out that the Bonpo historical tradition also makes that association.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6814749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6814749", "title": "Omphalion", "text": "Omphalion\n\nOmphalion in Greek means \"navel (of the earth)\"; compare the \"omphalos\" of Delphi.\n\nOne of the most intriguing features of St. Sophia is a marble section of the floor known as the Omphalos. The Omphalos is located in the south-east quarter of the main square beneath the dome, exactly in the middle of the square. Each side measures 5.65 meters (18.5 feet). Within the square lay 30 circles of various sizes. There is one large circle in the middle; 4 circles of equal size at each corner; 2 smaller circles of similar size occupy the space between each corner circle; 16 smaller circles in-between these. The 3 remaining circles are on the south end and are linked to the 4 larger circles on that end. \n\nThe most striking feature of the Omphalos is the brilliant marble, with a myriad of types and colors mixed in. Marble was the material of choice for Imperial churches. Strangely, it was believed to be created by earthy matter freezing in water that had sunk into the Earth's crust. The design is unusual and has been interpreted in many ways over the years. One interpretation could be that is that the central circle could be the sun, with the solar system orbiting around it. This would fit with the absolute rule of the Emperor. The asymmetry is particularly odd, given when compared to the omphalos at Hosios Loukas in Greece. This omphalos dates from the Middle Byzantine, some five hundred years after the St. Sophia's if it is indeed an original feature, and is completely symmetrical in design. Stylistically, the interiors of Hagia Sophia have been categorized as a \"jeweled style\". The materials utilized were selected to retain and reflect light. The mosaics used tesserae of varying colors, texturized and oriented to reflect the light pouring in from the massive dome. Color was very important as certain colors, and certain materials, conveyed messages of status and prestige. The effect of the sunlight shining through the windows surrounding the base of the dome hitting the tesserae would have been awe-inspiring. Comparatively, the Omphalos is more demure and understated.\n\nHistorically, it was thought to mark the spot where Byzantine emperors were crowned during the coronation ceremony. Evidence of this comes from Antony of Novgorod, who wrote a description of St. Sophia in the early 13th century. He wrote \"there is a red marble stone with a golden throne placed on it. On this throne the emperors were crowned\". This view has been challenged over the years because of the dearth of textual reference from writers and travelers in the Byzantine Era. Hagia Sophia herself has been altered so many times since the sixth-century that the Omphalion disappears and re-appears sporadically in the textual evidence that does exist. We know that it was covered over with carpets by the Ottomans after they converted it into a mosque. The design is unique to Hagia Sophia, with little in the way of direct comparisons. There are two examples from the 11th and 12th centuries, Hosios Lukas and Nea Moni. The comparison is difficult considering the 500 year difference. All of the marble used in the floors of St. Sophia was quarried around the time of construction. \n\nByzantine architecture of the time favored the incorporation of spolia to celebrate the triumph of Christianity over Paganism, as much of the spolia was sourced from Greek and Roman temples throughout the Empire. Dating of the Omphalos has varied, with some dating it to the reign of Justinian, and some dating it as a later addition, particularly to the reign of Basil I (867-886). The evidence used to argue for this later dating is the seemingly odd placement within Hagia Sophia. However, it is placed in the center of one of the four squares beneath the dome, indicating the placement was not as random as it seems at first glance. Historian Nadine Schibille argues that it fits seamlessly into the original flooring, therefore she concludes that it was an original feature. Historian Silvia Pedone does not attempt to assign a specific date to it, but she theorizes that it was arranged differently than what is seen today. Some of the smaller circles might have been an addition during re-decoration in the 9th century. The church suffered damage during an earthquake in 1346 that could have damaged the marble. This could account for the asymmetrical design, with repairs altering the overall design.\n\nThe word \"omphalion\" is also used to describe other sacred circular marking slabs that were usually located in important or especially sacred churches throughout the Byzantine Empire.\n\nThe marble omphalion from the floor of the Church of Hagia Sophia in Trabzon (north coast of modern Turkey) was brought to Thessalonica by Greek refugees in 1924.\n\n"}
{"id": "1113784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1113784", "title": "Open-design movement", "text": "Open-design movement\n\nThe open-design movement involves the development of physical products, machines and systems through use of publicly shared design information. This includes the making of both free and open-source software (FOSS) as well as open-source hardware. The process is generally facilitated by the Internet and often performed without monetary compensation. The goals and philosophy of the movement are identical to that of the open-source movement, but are implemented for the development of physical products rather than software. Open design is a form of co-creation, where the final product is designed by the users, rather than an external stakeholder such as a private company.\n\nSharing of manufacturing information can be traced back to the 18th and 19th century. Aggressive patenting put an end to that period of extensive knowledge sharing.\nMore recently, principles of open design have been related to the free and open-source software movements. In 1997 Eric S. Raymond, Tim O'Reilly and Larry Augustin established \"open source\" as an alternative expression to \"free software,\" and in 1997 Bruce Perens published the Open Source Definition. In late 1998, Dr. Sepehr Kiani (a PhD in mechanical engineering from MIT) realized that designers could benefit from open source policies, and in early 1999 he convinced Dr. Ryan Vallance and Dr. Samir Nayfeh of the potential benefits of open design in machine design applications. Together they established the Open Design Foundation (ODF) as a non-profit corporation, and set out to develop an Open Design Definition.\n\nThe idea of open design was taken up, either simultaneously or subsequently, by several other groups and individuals. The principles of open design are closely similar to those of open-source hardware design, which emerged in March 1998 when Reinoud Lamberts of the Delft University of Technology proposed on his “Open Design Circuits” website the creation of a hardware design community in the spirit of free software.\n\nRonen Kadushin coined the title \"Open Design\" in his 2004 Master’s thesis, and the term was later formalized in the 2010 Open Design Manifesto.\n\nThe open-design movement currently unites two trends. On one hand, people apply their skills and time on projects for the common good, perhaps where funding or commercial interest is lacking, for developing countries or to help spread ecological or cheaper technologies. On the other hand, open design may provide a framework for developing advanced projects and technologies that might be beyond the resource of any single company or country and involve people who, without the copyleft mechanism, might not collaborate otherwise. There is now also a third trend, where these two methods come together to use high-tech open-source (e.g. 3D printing) but customized local solutions for sustainable development. Open Design holds great potential in driving future innovation as resent research has proven that stakeholder users working together produce more innovative designs than designers consulting users through more traditional means.\n\nThe open-design movement is currently fairly nascent but holds great potential for the future. In some respects design and engineering are even more suited to open collaborative development than the increasingly common open-source software projects, because with 3D models and photographs the concept can often be understood visually. It is not even necessary that the project members speak the same languages to usefully collaborate.\n\nHowever, there are certain barriers to overcome for open design when compared to software development where there are mature and widely used tools available and the duplication and distribution of code cost next to nothing. Creating, testing and modifying physical designs is not quite so straightforward because of the effort, time and cost required to create the physical artefact; although with access to emerging flexible computer-controlled manufacturing techniques the complexity and effort of construction can be significantly reduced (see tools mentioned in the fab lab article).\n\nOpen design is currently a fledgling movement consisting of several unrelated or loosely related initiatives. Many of these organizations are single, funded projects, while a few organizations are focusing on an area needing development. In some cases (e.g. Thingiverse for 3D printable designs or Appropedia for open source appropriate technology) organizations are making an effort to create a centralized open source design repository as this enables innovation. Notable organizations include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "438426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438426", "title": "Radio edit", "text": "Radio edit\n\nIn music, a radio edit is a modification, typically truncated, intended to make a song more suitable for airplay, whether it be adjusted for length, profanity, subject matter, instrumentation, or form. Radio edits may also be used for commercial single versions, which may be denoted as the \"7\" version\". However, not all \"radio edit\" tracks are played on radio.\n\nRadio edits often shorten a long song in order to make it more commercially viable for radio stations. The normal length for songs played on the radio is 3 to 4 minutes. Occasionally, the song will simply fade out earlier, common on tracks with long instrumental endings. For instance, the radio edit of 'Heroes' by David Bowie fades in shortly before the beginning of the third verse and fades out shortly before the vocal vamping at the end of the song. Another example is B.o.B's song, \"Nothin' On You\" featuring Bruno Mars, whose radio edit skips the first 5 seconds & starts with the 6th second in which Bruno Mars starts singing the first chorus. The second half of the first chorus is sometimes skipped, along with the last 24 seconds which is the normal fade-out part in which B.o.B says, \"Yeah, and that's just how we do it/And I'ma let this ride/B.o.B and Bruno Mars\", and the radio edit ends with the fourth and last chorus with an earlier fade-out. A 3rd example would be the song, \"The Man\" by Aloe Blacc, in which the radio edit skips the \"I'm the man/Go ahead & tell everybody/What I'm saying ya all\" part & the first 10 seconds. Also, the 3rd chorus of the song is shortened. However, many radio edits will also edit out verses, bridges, and interludes, such as the original single edit of \"Piano Man\" by Billy Joel which substitutes the end of the third verse for the ending of the second verse. Another example for this case is Justin Timberlake's \"Mirrors\", where the radio edit cuts the entire \"You are the love of my life\" part. Another example would be Juvenile's \"Back That Thang Up\" where Lil' Wayne's outro is faded out in the \"wobble de wop\" part.\n\nSome songs will be remixed heavily and feature different arrangements than the original longer versions, occasionally even being completely different recordings. A popular example of this is \"Revolution\" by The Beatles which is a completely different recording from the version which appears on \"The White Album\". Another example is Miley Cyrus's \"Adore You\", whose original album version is a slow, quiet version clocking in at 4 minutes & 37 seconds; the radio edit is a completely different version which is a remix done by Cedric Gervais running at 3 minutes & 36 seconds. Likewise, an attempt at a radio edit for Arlo Guthrie's 18-minute epic \"Alice's Restaurant\" scrapped the entire monologue that served as the main base of the song's popularity and instead was a 4-minute, three-verse rock and roll song. This also became more prevalent with the rise of the 12\" record, as artists like New Order started making songs specifically for the format. Many of the 7\" mixes aimed for pop radio airplay of their songs feature very different arrangements, such as \"Bizarre Love Triangle\", or even a completely different recording, such as \"Temptation\".\n\nSome long songs do not have a radio edit, despite being as long as 5, 6, 7, or 8 minutes in length, presumably due to listener demand from radio stations. Examples of this include the following 10 songs: \"Vicarious\" (2006) by Tool at 7 minutes and 6 seconds, \"Hey Jude\" (1968) by The Beatles at 7 minutes and 11 seconds long, \"You're the Voice\" (1986) by John Farnham at 5 minutes and 4 seconds long, \"Stairway to Heaven\" (1971) by Led Zeppelin at 8 minutes and 3 seconds, \"One\" (1989) by Metallica at 7 minutes and 24 seconds, \"American Pie\" (1971) by Don McLean with a length of 8 minutes and 32 seconds, \"Georgia Dome\" (2004) by Ying Yang Twins (which actually has a radio edit but removing profanity & not shortening it) at 6 minutes and 6 seconds, \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (1965) by Bob Dylan at 6 minutes & 13 seconds, \"Someone Saved My Life Tonight\" (1975) by Elton John at 6 minutes & 45 seconds, and \"Again\" (2015) by Fetty Wap at 5 minutes and 13 seconds. The idea of extended songs receiving airplay on commercial radio was extremely rare until the birth of progressive radio in the mid-1960s; most rock music formats descend from progressive radio, and as such, rock songs tend to be played at their longer original length than songs of other formats.\n\nOn rare occasions, a radio edit might be longer than the original album version. This may occur when the song is edited for form, such as in the cases of \"Creep\" by Radiohead, \"2 On\" by Tinashe, and \"Miserable\" by Lit. \"Creep\"'s radio edit has a 4-second drumstick count off before the regular first second, \"2 On\" repeats part of the chorus 1 more time than it does on the normal version, and Miserable's radio edit adds the chorus between the first and second verses. Some radio edits lengthen some parts of the song while shortening others. For example, the radio edit of \"Thinking Out Loud\" by Ed Sheeran has a 6-second introduction before the first verse but later in the song cuts from the end of the second verse to the beginning of the last chorus, omitting the second chorus and the guitar solo. Different radio stations may edit songs differently for length; an example is \"Uptown Funk\" by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. Some radio stations cut the bridge and outro, some shorten the hooks and others go from the second chorus to the outro.\n\nThe syndicated radio format \"QuickHitz\", notably adopted by the Calgary radio station CKMP-FM in August 2014, utilizes even shorter edits of songs, from 1 minute and 30 seconds to 2 minutes in length.\n\nRadio edits often come with any necessary censorship done to conform to decency standards imposed by government agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in Canada, the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas in the Philippines, the Australian Communications and Media Authority in Australia, and Ofcom in the United Kingdom. The offending words may be silenced, reversed, distorted, or replaced by a tone or sound effect. The edits may come from the record label itself, broadcasters at the corporate level before the song is sent for airplay to their stations, or in rarer cases, at a radio station itself depending on local standards. \n\nSome individual stations may be more lenient with words that tread the broadcast-appropriate line, depending on their management and programming format; for instance a rhythmic AC, classic hits, adult contemporary or urban contemporary station may indeed make several radio edits to a song to appeal to a broad base of listeners, while a rhythmic contemporary, modern rock or hip-hop-focused station might be more apt to have a light hand in their radio edits to appeal both to listeners and artists who would be favorable to the station's reputation. Some edits might even be done for promotional reasons; for instance a song that mentions a city's name or a certain radio station might see a special 'station cut' where the station and its community are mentioned in the song (as heard in Lady Gaga's \"You and I\", which has a reference to Nebraska that is easily substituted with another region, state or city; similarly Sia's \"Cheap Thrills\" is sometimes edited to replace the line \"turn the radio on\" with \"...turn [station name] on\" to promote the radio station on which the song is playing).\n\nOne example would be \"Dynamite\" by Taio Cruz, replacing the word, \"fuck\" with a sound effect. Another example is \"Talk Dirty\" by Jason Derulo featuring 2 Chainz, in which the radio edit omits 3 of the words present in the song: \"penis\", \"sex\", & \"pussy\". \"Penis\" is replaced with an elephant sound effect, \"sex\" is replaced by an echo of the word \"oral\" that precedes it in the standard album version from \"Tattoos\" & \"Talk Dirty\", & \"pussy\" is replaced with a sound effect of a cat meowing. Occasionally, the song may be re-recorded with different lyrics, ranging from just the replacement of one line being re-recorded, like James Blunt's \"You're Beautiful,\" which replaces \"fucking high\" with \"flying high\" in the second verse, to the entire song be completely changed, such as D12's \"Purple Hills\", which replaces profanity, drug references, and other inappropriate lyrics from the original \"Purple Pills\". Another example of the first type (one-line replacement) is The Black Eyed Peas song \"Let's Get It Started\", whose original title was \"Let's Get Retarded\" but was changed to make it suitable for radio play. Sean Kingston's \"Beautiful Girls\", in some radio edits, changed \"You got me suicidal\" to \"in denial\". The whole chorus of Cee Lo Green's \"Fuck You\" substituted the word \"Fuck\" with \"Forget\", thus changing the title to \"Forget You\" on the radio edit. In Bruno Mars' song \"That's What I Like\", as played on \"The Steve Harvey Morning Show\", \"You and your ass invited\" is replaced by an instrumental version; the same occurs in the line, \"Sex by the fire at night\".\n\nRadio edits may have more or fewer words edited than the \"clean version\", because of the stations' or agencies' standards. An \"amended\" radio edit which only removes the major profanities while keeping the small profanities can be produced for some stations that allow small profanities (e.g. \"You're Going Down\" by Sick Puppies and \"Bad Girlfriend\" by Theory of a Deadman) whereas a \"dirty\" radio edit preserving the offensive language but maintaining the shorter play time may be produced, which may be aimed at club play, nighttime radio, and non-terrestrial radio stations. Kid Rock wrote the term \"radio edit\" into two of his songs, both of which are the same on radio and album versions. After two million copies of Michael Jackson's \"They Don't Care About Us\" had already been shipped, the lyrics of the original track with the words \"Jew me\" and \"Kike me\" were replaced with \"do me\" and \"strike me\" due to its controversial anti-Semitic references. Radio edit versions of the track remained with the original version until the edited version was pressed and released. An example occurs in Lady Gaga's song \"Poker Face\", where the line, \"P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face\" is misheard as, \"P-p-p-poker face, p-p-fuck her face\". Some radio stations repeated the word \"poker\" from the first part of the line, while others played the original version. A promotional CD single is available containing both of these versions. The edited version is available on the compilation \"Now 31\" in the US.\n\nOther terms for a \"radio edit\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37426768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37426768", "title": "Robert Gill", "text": "Robert Gill\n\nMajor Robert Gill (1804–1879) was an army officer, antiquarian, painter and photographer in British India. He is best known for his paintings copying the frescoes of the Ajanta caves. Gill was the first painter – after their rediscovery in 1819 – to make extensive copies of the Buddhist cave paintings, which mostly date to the 5th century CE. His surviving copies and drawings remain significant in Ajanta studies as the originals have significantly deteriorated since his time.\n\nGill was born in Hackney, London, the son of a stockbroker. He joined the 44th Madras Native Infantry as a cadet in 1824 and became an ensign on 6 May 1825. Promotion to Lieutenant followed in September 1826, and to Captain on 6 May 1840; finally he was promoted to Major. On 25 May 1841, he married Frances Flowerdew Rickerby at St Luke's Church, Chelsea, in London. He was discharged as an invalid on 1 October 1852. His first child, a daughter called Frances Eliza Minchin Gill (1842-1930), was born in Madras. His first son, the soldier, explorer and intelligence officer William John Gill (1843-1882), was born in Bangalore. A second daughter, Rose Matilda Gill, was born in Chelsea in 1845 but died when less than three weeks old. A second son, the lawyer Robert Thomas Gill (1847-1927) was born in Jaulnah, as was a third daughter, Lucy Annie Gill (1849-1903). Robert Gill may have had several children who died in infancy by his first Indian mistress, Paro. He had two daughters by his second Indian mistress: Mildred Mary Gill (1866-1923) and Annie Gill (c.1864-1934).\n\nGill was a member of The Royal Asiatic Society, and this association was eventually parlayed into copying the murals that had first been published in a lecture by James Fergusson to the Bombay branch of the Society, and later inclusion and illustration in his book in Indian rock-cut architecture. From 1844, Gill was taken away from military service to copy the Ajanta murals for the Asiatic Society of Bombay, at an additional salary of 200 rupees a year. He spent thirty years measuring, mapping, cataloguing, photographing, and painting in the caves, despite dangers from wild animals and the local Bhil people.\n\nArriving at Ajanta in early 1845, he completed an initial survey and inspection, submitting a report the same year. He began to ship completed paintings back to London in 1847, where many were exhibited at the museum of the East India Company. A number of them were reproduced, somewhat crudely, in an article in 1849 in the \"Illustrated London News\". He had copied about 30 of the principal frescoes on canvas at almost full-size by 1863, when the painting phase of his work largely ended; these works were sent to London. Unfortunately, twenty-five of his pictures were burnt during the 1866 fire at The Crystal Palace, where they were on loan and being exhibited. Another was destroyed by a fire in a storeroom in the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in 1885. This was the same fire that destroyed most of the next generation of Ajanta copies, just completed by a team from the Bombay School of Art. None of Gill's lost copies had been photographed. The four surviving Gill copies are in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London; a number of his drawings are in the British Library.\n\nGill remained based at Ajanta for the rest of his life, also making tours to other ancient sites in India. He took up photography, including stereoscopy, in about 1856, and much of his photographic work is published in two books, \"The Rock-Cut Temples of India\", and \"One Hundred Stereoscopic Illustrations of Architecture and Natural History in Western India\", with notes by James Fergusson.\n\nGill's surviving photographs, drawings, and paintings are constantly cited by scholars of Ajanta and Indian art generally, as they have preserved the memories of original painted surfaces that have undergone significant flaking. Accelerated deterioration began immediately upon the caves' rediscovery starting in 1819. According to the Victoria and Albert Museum, even in Gill's time the original cave paintings could be seen suffering damage from frequent, unsupervised visitation and also from \"swarms of bees and bats.\" Gill's works also record the condition of the stonework at the time; some sections have since been lost, such as the portico to Cave 1, and others considerably repaired and tidied. Many of his plans, drawings, and photographs are available online at the British Library and other places.\n\nLike many other British Indian officers of those days, Gill was an avid hunter and killed about 150 tigers, mostly on foot. He died in 1879 while being transported from Ajanta to Bhusawal in a very ill condition, and was buried at the Catholic Cemetery at Bhusawal.\n\nIn 2012, a Marathi language film, Ajintha, was made based on his work and love story with a native girl Paro.\n\n"}
{"id": "872847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=872847", "title": "SCO–Linux disputes", "text": "SCO–Linux disputes\n\nThe SCO–Linux disputes are a series of legal and public disputes between the software company SCO Group (SCO) and various Linux vendors and users. The SCO Group alleges that its license agreements with IBM means that source code that IBM wrote and donated to be incorporated into Linux was added in violation of SCO's contractual rights. Members of the Linux community disagree with SCO's claims; IBM, Novell and Red Hat have ongoing claims against SCO.\n\nOn August 10, 2007, a federal district court judge in \"SCO v. Novell\" ruled on summary judgment that Novell, not the SCO Group, is the rightful owner of the copyrights covering the Unix operating system. The court also ruled that \"SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent\". After the ruling Novell announced they have no interest in suing people over Unix and stated \"We don't believe there is Unix in Linux\". The final district court ruling, on November 20, 2008, affirmed the summary judgment, and added interest and a constructive trust.\n\nOn August 24, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit partially reversed the district court judgment. The appeals court remanded back to trial on the issues of copyright ownership and Novell's contractual waiver rights. The court upheld the $2,547,817 award granted to Novell for the 2003 Sun agreement.\n\nOn March 30, 2010, following a jury trial, Novell, and not The SCO Group, was unanimously found to be the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare copyrights. The SCO Group, through bankruptcy trustee Edward Cahn, has decided to continue the lawsuit against IBM for causing a decline in SCO revenues.\n\nOn March 1, 2016, SCO's lawsuit against IBM was dismissed with prejudice; SCO then filed an appeal later that month.\n\nUnix is a major computer operating system, developed in the United States of America. Prior to the events of this case, the intellectual property rights (IP) in Unix were held by Unix System Laboratories (USL), part of AT&T, but the area of IP ownership was complex. By 2003, the rights in Unix had been transferred several times and there was dispute as to the correct owner in law. Also some of the code within Unix had been written prior to the Copyright Act of 1976, or was developed by third parties, or was developed or licensed under different licenses existing at the time. The software company SCO Group (SCO), formerly Caldera International, asserted in 2003 that it was the owner of Unix, and that other unix-type operating systems - particularly the free operating system Linux and other variants of Unix sold by competitor companies - were violating their intellectual property by using Unix code without a license in their works.\n\nSCO initially claimed, and tried to assert, a legal means to litigate directly against all end-users of these operating systems as well as the companies or groups providing them - potentially a very substantial case and one that would throw fear into the market about using them. However it was unable to formulate such a case, since the Unix copyrights were weakly worded, there was no basis in patent law, and breach of trade secrets would only affect the one or few companies who might have been alleged to have disclosed trade secrets. Lacking grounds to sue all users generally, SCO dropped this aspect of its cases.\n\nThe assertions were heavily contested. Claims of SCO's own copyright violations of these other systems were raised, along with claims related to SCO being bound by, or violating, the GPL licence, under which SCO conducted business related to these systems. Claims were also made that the case was substantially financed and promoted by Microsoft and investment businesses with links to Microsoft; around that time (1998 - 2004 onwards) Microsoft was fiercely engaged in various FUD tactics such as its \"Get the facts\" campaign, that sought to undermine or discredit Linux as a possible competitor to its own Windows operating systems and server systems.\n\nIn the end, SCO launched only a few main legal cases - against IBM for improper disclosure and breach of copyright related to its AIX operating system, against Novell for interference (clouding the issue of ownership), against DaimlerChrysler for non-compliance with a demand to certify certain matters related to Unix usage, and against Linux business and former client AutoZone for violating SCO's rights by using Linux. Separately, the Linux company Red Hat also filed a legal claim against SCO for making false claims that affected its (Red Hat's) business, and to seek a court declaration that SCO had no ownership rights in Linux code.\n\nIn 2007, a court ruled in \"SCO v. Novell\" that Novell and not SCO was the owner of the Unix copyrights. , most of these cases have been resolved, or largely resolved, and none of the rulings have been in SCO's favor.\n\nAt the beginning of 2003, SCO claimed that there had been \"misappropriation of its UNIX System V code into Linux\". However, the company refused to identify the specific segments of code, claiming that it was a secret which they would reveal only to the court. They did say that the code could be found in the SMP, RCU and a few other parts of the Linux kernel.\n\nOn 6 March 2003 they announced that they were suing IBM for $1 billion, claiming that IBM transferred SCO trade secrets into Linux. That amount later rose to $3 billion, and then again to $5 billion.\n\nSome educated parties note that the \"USL v. BSDi\" case had shown that the Unix copyrights are weak and unenforceable. SCO has not claimed patent infringement, as according to the US Patent and Trademark Office database, no AT&T or Novell patent was ever assigned to SCO. The UNIX trademark was not owned by SCO. That left arguing over trade secrets, which after some opposition, was hard to take beyond a breach of contract between SCO and IBM, and consequentially a claim only against IBM. SCO was looking for something directed at the greater Linux community, and has since explicitly dropped all trade secret claims from their case.\n\nSCO now had little legal ground at this point and therefore began numerous legal claims and threats against many of the major names in the computer industry, including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, Novell, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems and Red Hat.\n\nBy mid-2004, five major lawsuits had been filed:\n\n\nIn cases SCO publicly implied that a number of other parties have committed copyright infringement, including not only Linux developers but also Linux users.\n\nSCO's claims are derived from several contracts that may have transferred UNIX System V Release 4 intellectual property assets. The UNIX IP rights originated with Unix System Laboratories (USL), a division of AT&T. In 1993, USL sold all UNIX rights and assets to Novell, including copyrights, trademarks, and active licensing contracts. Some of these rights and assets, plus additional assets derived from Novell's development work, were then sold to the Santa Cruz Operation in 1995. The Santa Cruz Operation had developed and was selling a PC-based UNIX until 2000, when it then resold its UNIX assets to Caldera Systems, which later reorganized into Caldera International and changed its name to SCO Group.\n\nThrough this chain of sales, SCO claims to be the \"owner of UNIX\". The validity of these claims is hotly contested by others. SCO claims copyright to all UNIX code developed by USL, referred to as SVRx, and licensing contracts originating with AT&T, saying that these are inherited through the same chain of sales. The primary document SCO presents as evidence of these claims is the \"Asset Purchase Agreement\", defining the sale between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation. SCO says that this includes all copyrights to the UNIX code base and contractual rights to the licensing base. The other parties disagree.\n\nThe status of copyrights from USL is murky, since UNIX code is a compilation of elements with different copyright histories. Some code was released without copyright notice before the Copyright Act of 1976 made copyright automatic. This code may be in the public domain and not subject to copyright claims. Other code is affected by the \"USL v. BSDi\" case, and is covered by the BSD License.\n\nGroklaw uncovered an old settlement made between Unix System Laboratories (USL) and The University of California in the case of USL v. BSDi. This settlement ended a copyright infringement suit against the University for making BSD source code freely available that USL felt infringed their copyrights. The university filed a counter suit, saying that USL had taken BSD source code and put it in UNIX without properly acknowledging the university's copyright. This settlement muddies the question of SCO's ownership of major parts of the UNIX source code. This uncertainty is particularly significant in regard to SCO's claims against Linux, which uses some BSD code.\n\nNovell challenges SCO's interpretation of the purchase agreement. In response to a letter SCO sent to 1500 companies on May 12, 2003, Novell exchanged a series of letters with SCO beginning in May 2003, claiming that the copyrights for the core UNIX System V were not included in the asset purchase agreement and are retained by Novell. In October 2003, Novell registered those copyrights with the US Copyright Office.\n\nIn response to these challenges from Novell, SCO filed a \"slander of title\" suit against Novell, \"SCO v. Novell\". This claimed that Novell was interfering with their business activities by clouding the ownership of UNIX copyrights. SCO's claim for special damages was dismissed on June 9, 2004 for \"failure to specifically plead special damages.\" However, SCO was given 30 days \"to amend its complaint to more specifically plead special damages\". In the same ruling, the judge stated that it was questionable whether or not the Asset Purchase Agreement transferred the relevant copyrights, reasoning that the ASA amendment by which SCO was claiming to have acquired those rights contained no transfer language in the form of \"seller hereby conveys to buyer\" and that it used ambiguous language when it came to the question of when and how and which rights were to be transferred.\n\nSCO filed an amended complaint. In late July, 2005, Novell filed an answer to SCO's complaint, denying all of its accusations. Novell also filed its own Slander of Title counter-lawsuit against SCO. Novell has also filed claims for numerous breaches of the APA (Asset Purchase Agreement) between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation. Under the APA, Santa Cruz (and later SCO after SCO purchased Santa Cruz Operation's Unix Business) was given the right to market and sell Unixware as a product, retaining 100% of all revenues. Santa Cruz Operation (and later SCO) also was given the responsibility of administering Unix SVR4 license agreements on behalf of Novell. When money was paid for licensing, SCO was to turn over 100% of the revenue to Novell, and then Novell would return 5% as an Administration Fee. Novell claims that SCO signed Unix SVR4 licensing agreements with Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, as well as with numerous Linux End Users for Unix IP allegedly in the Linux Kernel, and then refused to turn the money over to Novell. Novell is suing for 100% of the revenue, claiming SCO is not entitled to the 5% administration fee since they breached their contract with Novell. Novell's counterclaims proposed asking the court to put appropriate funds from SCO into escrow until the case is resolved, since SCO's cash is diminishing quickly.\n\nNovell also retained the right to audit SCO's Unix Licensing Business under the APA. Novell claims that SCO has not turned over vital information about the Microsoft, Sun, and Linux End User License Agreements, despite repeated demands by Novell for them to do so. Novell, in another claim that is part of their counter suit, is asking the court to compel SCO to allow Novell to perform this audit of SCO's Unix Business.\n\nOn August 10, 2007 Judge Dale Kimball, hearing the SCO v. Novell case, ruled that \"...the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights\".\n\nThe Novell to Santa Cruz Operation Asset Purchase Agreement also involved the administration of some 6000 standing licensing agreements between various UNIX users and the previous owners. These licensees include universities, software corporations and computer hardware companies. SCO's claimed ownership of the licenses has become an issue in three aspects of the SCO–Linux controversies. The first was the cancellation of IBM's license, the second was SCO's complaint against DaimlerChrysler (see \"SCO v. DaimlerChrysler\"), and the third is the derivative works claim of the \"SCO v. IBM\" case.\n\nIn May 2003, SCO canceled IBM's SVRx license to its version of UNIX, AIX. This was based on SCO's claim of unrestricted ownership of the System V licensing contracts inherited from USL. IBM ignored the license cancellation, claiming that an amendment to the original license made it \"irrevocable.\" In addition, as part of the Purchase Agreement, Novell retained certain rights of control over the administration of the licenses which were sold, including rights to act on SCO's behalf in some cases. Novell exercised one of these rights by revoking SCO's cancellation of the IBM license. SCO disputed the validity of both of these actions, and amended its \"SCO v. IBM\" complaint to include copyright infringement, based on IBM's continued sale and use of AIX without a valid SVRx license.\n\nIn December 2003, SCO demanded that all UNIX licensees certify some items, some related to the use of Linux, that were not provided for in the license agreement language. Since DaimlerChrysler failed to respond, SCO filed the \"SCO v. DaimlerChrysler\" suit in March 2004. All claims related to the certification demands were summarily dismissed by the court.\n\nThe third issue based on the UNIX licensees agreement is related to SCO's claims of control of derivative works.\n\nMany UNIX licensees have added features to the core UNIX SVRx system and those new features contain computer code not in the original SVRx code base. In most cases, software copyright is owned by the person or company that develops the code. SCO, however, claims that the original licensing agreements define this new code as a derivative work. They also claim that they have the right to control and restrict the use and distribution of that new code.\n\nThese claims are the basis of \"SCO v. IBM\". SCO's initial complaint, said that IBM violated the original licensing agreement by not maintaining confidentiality with the new code, developed and copyrighted by IBM, and releasing it to the Linux project.\n\nIBM claims that the license agreement (noted in the $Echo newsletter of April 1985) and subsequent licenses defines derivative works as the developer's property. This leaves IBM free to do as it wishes with its new code. In August 2004, IBM filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The motion stated that IBM has the right to do as it wishes with software not part of the original SVRx code. In February 2005, the motion was dismissed as premature, because discovery was not yet complete. IBM refiled this motion along with other summary judgment motions as noted below in September 2006.\n\nSCO claims that Linux infringes SCO's copyright, trade secrets, and contractual rights. This claim is fundamental to the SCOsource program, where SCO has demanded that Linux users obtain licenses from SCOsource to be properly licensed to use the code in question. Exactly which parts of Linux are involved remains unclear as many of their claims are still under seal in the \"SCO v. IBM\" lawsuit.\n\nSCO originally claimed in \"SCO v. IBM\" that IBM had violated trade secrets. But these alleged violations by IBM would not have involved Linux distributors or end users. SCO's trade secret claims were dropped by SCO in their amended complaint.\n\nSCO also claimed line-for-line literal copying of code from UNIX code files to Linux kernel files and obfuscated copying of code, but originally refused to publicly identify which code was in violation. SCO submitted to the court evidence of their claims under seal but much of it was excluded from the case after it was challenged by IBM as not meeting the specificity requirements to be included.\n\nThese examples have fallen into two groups. The first are segments of files or whole files alleged to originate in UNIX SVRx code such as the errno.h header file. The second group are files and materials contributed by IBM that originated with IBM development work associated with AIX and Dynix, IBM's two UNIX products.\n\nEach of these has a different set of issues. In order for copyright to be violated, several conditions must be met. First, the claimant must be able to show that they own the copyrights for the material in question. Second, all or a significant part of the source must be present in the infringing material. There must be enough similarity to show direct copying of material.\n\nThe issue of ownership of the SVRx code base was discussed above. Besides the unresolved issue of what was actually transferred from Novell to Santa Cruz Operation, there are also the portions of the SVRx code base that are covered by BSD copyrights or that are in the public domain.\n\nSCO's first public disclosure of what they claim is infringing code was at SCO Forum in August 2003. The first, known as the Berkeley Packet Filter, was distributed under the BSD License and is freely usable by anyone. The second example was related to memory allocation functions, also released under the BSD License. It is no longer in the Linux code base.\n\nSCO has also claimed that code related to application programming interfaces was copied from UNIX. However, this code and the underlying standards they describe are in the public domain and are also covered by rights USL sold to The Open Group. A later claim was made to code segments related to ELF file format standards. This material was developed by the Tool Interface Standard (TIS) Committee and placed in the public domain. SCO claims that the TIS Committee had no authority to place ELF in the public domain, even though SCO's predecessor in interest was a member of the committee.\n\nSCO has claimed that some are violating UNIX SVRx copyrights by putting UNIX code into Linux. They may or may not have brought this claim directly in any of their cases. The IBM case is about derivative works, not SVRx code (see below). The Novell case is about copyright ownership. DaimlerChrysler was about contractual compliance statements.\n\nThe \"may or may not\" comes from AutoZone's case. In AutoZone, SCO's complaint claimed damages for AutoZone's use of Linux. However, when objecting to AutoZone's request for a stay pending the IBM case, SCO apparently contradicted their written complaint, claiming that the case was entirely about AutoZone copying certain libraries (outside the Linux kernel) from a UNIX system to a Linux-based system to facilitate moving an internal application to the Linux platform faster; SCO's original complaint does not appear to mention these libraries. AutoZone denies having done this with UNIX libraries. If SCO's oral description of their case is the correct one, then their AutoZone claim has nothing to do with the Linux kernel or the actions of any distributors.\n\nThe copyright issue is addressed directly in two of the cases. The first is by IBM in their counterclaim in \"SCO v. IBM\". The issue is central to a pending motion by IBM, stating that IBM violated no copyrights in its Linux related activities. It is also addressed by Red Hat in the Red Hat v. SCO case. Red Hat claims that SCO's statements about infringement in Linux are unproven and untrue, damaging to them and violates the Lanham Act. Red Hat asks for an injunction to stop claims of violations without proof. They also ask for a judgment that they violated no SCO copyrights. A hearing on the IBM motion was held on September 15, 2004. Judge Kimball took the motion under advisement. The Red Hat case is on hold.\n\n\"EWeek\" has reported allegations that SCO may have copied parts of the Linux kernel into SCO UNIX as part of its Linux Kernel Personality feature. If true, this would mean that SCO is guilty of a breach of the Linux kernel copyrights. SCO has denied this allegation, but according to Groklaw, one SCO employee confirmed it in a deposition.\n\nSCO has claimed a number of instances of IBM Linux code as breaches of contract. These examples include code related to Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), Journaled File System (JFS), Read-copy-update (RCU) and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA). This code is questionably in the Linux kernel, and may have been added by IBM through the normal kernel submission process. This code was developed and copyrighted by IBM. IBM added features to AIX and Dynix.\n\nSCO claims that they have \"control rights\" to this due to their licensing agreements with IBM. SCO disavows claiming that they own the code IBM wrote, rather comparing their \"control rights\" to an easement, rights which allow them to prohibit IBM from publicizing the code they wrote, even though IBM owns the copyrights. They base this claim on language in the original license agreement that requires non-disclosure of the code and claim that all code developed by UNIX licensees that is used with the code under license be held in confidence. This claim is discussed above at Control of derivative works.\n\nBefore changing their name to the SCO Group, the company was known as Caldera International.\n\nCaldera was one of the major distributors of Linux between 1994 and 1998. In August 1998, the company split into Caldera Systems and Caldera Thin Clients, with Caldera Systems taking over the Linux systems business and Caldera Thin Clients concentrating on the Thin Clients and embedded business. The parent and shell company Caldera, Inc. ceased to exist in 2000 after a settlement with Microsoft in the Caldera v. Microsoft lawsuit.\n\nCaldera Systems was reorganized to become Caldera International in 2001, the company, which was renamed to The SCO Group in 2002.\n\nSome, like Eben Moglen, have suggested that because Caldera distributed the allegedly infringing code under the GNU General Public License, or GPL, that this act would license any proprietary code in Linux.\n\nSCO has stated that they did not know their own code was in Linux, so releasing it under the GPL does not count. However, as late as July and August 2006, long after that claim was made, they were still distributing ELF files (the subject of one of SCO's claims regarding SVRx) under the GPL.\n\nSCO has also claimed, in early stages of the litigation, that the GPL is invalid and non-binding and legally unenforceable. In response, supporters of the GPL, such as Eben Moglen, claimed that SCO's right to distribute Linux relied upon the GPL being a valid copyright license. Later court filings by the SCO Group in \"SCO v. IBM\" use SCO's alleged compliance with the license as a defense to IBM's counterclaims.\n\nThe GPL has become an issue in \"SCO v. IBM\". Under U.S. copyright law, distribution of creative works whose copyright is owned by another party is illegal without permission from the copyright owner, usually in the form of a license; the GPL is such a license, and thus allows distribution, but only under limited conditions. Since IBM released the relevant code under the terms of the GPL, it claims that the only permission that SCO has to copy and distribute IBM's code in Linux is under the terms and conditions of the GPL, one of which requires the distributor to \"accept\" the GPL. IBM says that SCO violated the GPL by denouncing the GPL's validity, and by claiming that the GPL violates the U.S. Constitution, together with copyright, antitrust and export control laws. IBM also claims that SCO's SCOsource program is incompatible with the requirement that redistributions of GPLed works must be free of copyright licensing fees (fees may be charged for the acts of duplication and support). IBM has brought counterclaims alleging that SCO has violated the GPL and breached IBM's copyrights by collecting licensing fees while distributing IBM's copyrighted material.\n\nOn March 7, 2003, SCO filed suit against IBM. Initially this lawsuit was about breach of contract and trade secrets. Later, SCO dropped the trade secrets claim, so the claim is breach of contract. SCO also added a copyright claim related to IBM's continued use of AIX, but not related to Linux. The judge subsequently stated that the SCO Group had indeed made a claim of copyright infringement against IBM regarding Linux. IBM filed multiple counter claims, including charges of both patent violations, which were later dropped, and violation of copyright law.\n\nOn February 8, 2005, Judge Kimball ruled that IBM's motions for summary judgment were premature but added:\nViewed against the backdrop of SCO's plethora of public statements concerning IBM's and others' infringement of SCO's purported copyrights to the UNIX software, it is astonishing that SCO has not offered any competent evidence to create a disputed fact regarding whether IBM has infringed SCO's alleged copyrights through IBM's Linux activities.\n\nOn June 28, 2006 Judge Brooke Wells granted, in part, IBM's motion to limit SCO's claims and excluded 186 of SCO's 294 items of allegedly misused intellectual property (IBM had challenged 201 of them for various reasons). Wells cited a number of factors including SCO's inability to provide sufficient specificity in these claims:\nIn December 2003, near the beginning of this case, the court ordered SCO to, \"identify and state with specificity the source code(s) that SCO is claiming forms the basis of their action against IBM.\" Even if SCO lacked the code behind methods and concepts at this early stage, SCO could have and should have, at least articulated which methods and concepts formed \"the basis of their action against IBM.\" At a minimum, SCO should have identified the code behind their method and concepts in the final submission pursuant to this original order entered in December 2003 and Judge Kimball’s order entered in July 2005.\n\nThis left about 100 of SCO's items of allegedly misused intellectual property (the merits of which have not yet been judged), out of 294 items originally disclosed by SCO.\n\nFollowing the partial summary judgment rulings in the SCO vs Novell Slander of Title case, Judge Kimball asked the parties in SCO v IBM to prepare by August 31, 2007, a statement of the status of this case.\n\nRed Hat filed suit against SCO on August 4, 2003. Red Hat sued SCO for false advertising, deceptive trade practices and asked for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement of any of SCO's copyrights. This case has been stayed pending resolution of the IBM case.\n\nAfter SCO initiated their Linux campaign, they said that they were the owners of UNIX. Novell claimed these statements were false, and that they still owned the rights in question. After Novell registered the copyrights to some key UNIX products, SCO filed suit against Novell on January 20, 2004. Novell removed the suit to federal court on February 6, 2004.\n\nOn July 29, 2005, Novell filed its answer with the court, denying SCO's claims. Novell also filed counterclaims asking the court to force SCO to turn over the revenues it had received from UNIX licenses, less a 5% administrative fee. Additionally, Novell asked the court to place the funds in a \"constructive trust\" in order to ensure that SCO could pay Novell since the company's assets were depleting rapidly.\n\nOn August 10, 2007, Judge Dale Kimball, hearing the SCO v. Novell case, ruled that \"...the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights\". Novell was awarded summary judgments on a number of claims, and a number of SCO claims were denied. SCO was instructed to account for and pass to Novell an appropriate portion of income relating to SCOSource licences to Sun Microsystems and Microsoft. A number of matters are not disposed of by Judge Kimball's ruling, and the outcome of these are still pending.\n\nOn July 16, 2008, the trial court issued an order awarding Novell $2,547,817 and ruled that SCO was not authorized to enter into the 2003 agreement with Sun. On November 20, 2008, final judgment in the case affirmed the August 10 ruling, and added interest of $918,122 plus $489 per diem after August 29, 2008, along with a constructive trust of $625,486.90.\n\nOn August 24, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit partially reversed the August 10, 2007 district court summary judgment ruling. The appeals court remanded back to trial on the issues of copyright ownership and Novell's contractual waiver rights. The court upheld the $2,547,817 award granted to Novell for the 2003 Sun agreement. On March 30, 2010, after a three-week trial before Judge Ted Stewart, a jury returned a verdict \"confirming Novell's ownership of the Unix copyrights.\"\n\nOn June 10, 2010, Judge Ted Stewart denied SCO's motion for another trial and ruled for Novell on all remaining issues.\n\nOn July 7, 2010, SCO appealed the new judgments to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n\nOn August 30, 2011, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court ruling in its entirety, rejecting SCO's attempt to re-argue the case before the Court of Appeals.\n\nAutoZone, a corporate user of Linux and former user of SCO OpenServer, was sued by SCO on March 3, 2004. SCO claims AutoZone violated SCO's copyrights by using Linux. The suit was stayed pending the resolution of the IBM, Red Hat and Novell cases.\n\nOn September 26, 2008, Judge Robert C. Jones lifted the stay, effective December 31, 2008. He initially scheduled discovery for April 9, 2010. SCO filed an amended complaint on August 14, 2009. On August 31, 2009, AutoZone replied, and filed a motion to dismiss in part.\n\nOn October 22, 2009, Edward Cahn, SCO's Chapter 11 trustee, sought bankruptcy court approval for an agreement he reached with AutoZone. According to the court filings, the confidential settlement resolves all claims between SCO and AutoZone.\n\nIn December 2003, SCO demanded that some UNIX licensees certify certain issues regarding their use of Linux. DaimlerChrysler, a former UNIX user and current Linux user, did not respond to this demand. On March 3, 2004 SCO filed suit against DaimlerChrysler for violating their UNIX license agreement by failing to respond to the certification request. Almost every claim SCO made has been ruled against in summary judgment. The last remaining issue, that of whether DaimlerChrysler made a timely response, was dismissed by agreement of SCO and DaimlerChrysler in December 2004. SCO retains the right to continue this case at a future date, providing it pays legal fees to DaimlerChrysler.\n\nOn June 23, 2003, SCO sent out a letter announcing that it would not be suing its own Linux customers. In the letter, it states:\n\nIn August 2003, SCO presented two examples of what they claimed was illegal copying of copyrighted code from UNIX to Linux. One of the examples (Berkeley Packet Filter) was not related to original UNIX code at all. The other example did, however, seem to originate from the UNIX code and was apparently contributed by a UNIX vendor, Silicon Graphics. However, an analysis by the Linux community later revealed that:\n\n\nIn October 2003, BayStar Capital and Royal Bank of Canada invested US$50 million in The SCO Group to support the legal cost of SCO's Linux campaign. Later it was shown that BayStar was referred to SCO by Microsoft, whose proprietary Windows operating system competes with Linux. In 2003, BayStar looked at SCO on the recommendation of Microsoft, according to Lawrence R. Goldfarb, managing partner of BayStar Capital: \"It was evident that Microsoft had an agenda\".\n\nOn April 22, 2004, \"The New York Times\" reported that BayStar Capital, a private hedge fund which had arranged for $50M in funding for SCO in October 2003, was asking for its $20M back. The remainder of the $50M was from Royal Bank of Canada. SCO stated in their press release that they believed that BayStar did not have grounds for making this demand.\n\nOn August 27, 2004, SCO and BayStar resolved their dispute.\n\nThe Canopy Group is an investment group with shares in a trust of different companies. It is a group owned by the Noorda family, also founders of Novell.\n\nUntil February 2005, Canopy held SCO shares, and the management of SCO held shares of Canopy. The two parties became embroiled in a bitter dispute when the Noorda family sought to oust board member Ralph Yarro III on claims of misappropriation. With internal problems not made public (which included the suicides of Canopy's director of information systems, Robert Penrose, and Val Kriedel, the daughter of Ray Noorda), the Canopy Group agreed to buy back all the shares that SCO had in Canopy in exchange for their SCO shares and cash.\n\nSCO and Canopy Group are now mostly independent, though SCO continues to rent their Utah office space from Canopy.\n\nOn March 4, 2004, a leaked SCO internal e-mail detailed how Microsoft had raised up to $106 million via the BayStar referral and other means. Blake Stowell of SCO confirmed the memo was real. BayStar claimed the deal was suggested by Microsoft, but that no money for it came directly from them.\nIn addition to the Baystar involvement, Microsoft paid SCO $6M (USD) in May 2003 for a license to \"Unix and Unix-related patents\", despite the lack of Unix-related patents owned by SCO.\nThis deal was widely seen in the press as a boost to SCO's finances which would help SCO with its lawsuit against IBM.\n\nAfter their initial claim of copyright infringement in the Linux kernel, The SCO Group started their SCOsource initiative, which sells licenses of SCO's claimed copyrighted software, other than OpenServer and Unixware licenses. After a small number of high-profile sales (including one that was denied by the claimed purchaser), SCO claimed to offer corporate users of Linux a license at US$699 per processor running Linux. However, many individuals have found it impossible to buy such a license from SCO. SCO says that participants of the SCOsource initiative are not liable for any claims that SCO makes against Linux users.\n\nOn July 14, 2005, an email was unsealed that had been sent from Michael Davidson to Reg Broughton (both Caldera International employees) in 2002, before many of the lawsuits. In it, Davidson reported how the company had hired an outside consultant because \"(spelling as in the original)\":\nThe consultant was to review the Linux code and compare it to Unix source code, to find possible copyright infringement. Davidson himself said that he had not expected to find anything significant based on his own knowledge of the code and had voiced his opinion that it was \"a waste of time\". After 4 to 6 months of consultant's work, Davidson says: \"\"...we had found absolutely *nothing*. ie no evidence of any copyright infringement whatsoever.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46334524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46334524", "title": "Statue of Edward Snowden", "text": "Statue of Edward Snowden\n\nThe statue of Edward Snowden, called Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument 2.0 by its creators, was an ephemeral, illegally installed public statue of Edward Snowden, an American whistleblower who leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) and was charged with federal crimes as a result. The bronze-like statue was placed in Fort Greene Park in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York City, on April 6, 2015. It was attached to a Doric column on the perimeter of the park's Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument, a memorial and crypt which honors and inters the more than 11,500 American prisoners of war who died in the American Revolution while housed on British prison ships.\n\nAffixed atop an existing column, the statue was mounted by three anonymous artists and their helpers, who were dressed in white construction helmets and reflective vests in imitation of Parks Department workers, early in the morning of April 6, then covered and taken down by NYC Parks officials later that day. A hologram tribute to Snowden was subsequently installed after the statue was removed.\n\nThe piece was conceived in 2014 by two artists from New York City and a sculptor from the West Coast. The sculptor volunteered his time and skill in creating the statue, with the piece eventually costing thousands of dollars to create over six months. The artwork consisted of a high, bust of Snowden on top of a Doric column, with a Plexiglas stand with Snowden's name on it.\n\nThe piece was fused to Fort Greene Park's Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in the pre-dawn hours of April 6, 2015. The sculptor recommended that the two artists create a bust after they had suggested a life-size statue of Snowden. The bust was made from Hydrocal, a plaster-like substance resembling bronze in appearance, which was then fixed to the pre-existing column with a non-damaging adhesive. The piece was designed to be similar in style to other sculptures in the park.\n\nWhile it was very important to the artists that the piece be more than just a prop or papier-mache effigy, they also wished not to damage the surface to which the bust would be bound. After some debate, they decided on an adhesive that would firmly hold the head in place, yet could be removed without marring the monument. The statue had Snowden's name at its base, consistent with the names on the bases of other sculptures in the park.\n\nThe \"Guardian\" newspaper expressed the view that the statue also looked like the former White House press secretary Jay Carney and some people thought it looked more like him than it did Snowden.\n\n\"Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument 2.0\" is one of at least six sculptures and monuments to Snowden that have appeared around the world. In October 2014, a statue of Snowden appeared in Union Square, Manhattan, near Henry Kirke Brown's Abraham Lincoln statue. It was shown in conjunction with the Art in Odd Places festival and was sculpted by Jim Dessicino, a Delaware artist. One of the statue's observers compared Snowden to Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the \"Pentagon Papers\" to the \"New York Times\".\n\nThe creators of the statue, who were dubbed \"guerrilla artists\" by some in the media, released a statement to the Animal New York website detailing their motivations and documenting the statue's installation in exchange for anonymity. In their statement, the artists said:\n\nThe artists also expressed their dismay with perceived public apathy at Snowden's revelations.\n\nWhile anticipating the sculpture's probable demise, the creators told \"Mashable\" on April 6, 2015 that they \"hope New York will embrace and protect this piece, much as when the \"Wall Street Bull\" was granted a permanent public home after its guerrilla placement. Even though it's already on it's way towards being removed, the possibility exists for the city to make the piece available for public viewing in a sanctioned way.\"\n\nThe unsanctioned bust had appeared a few hours after HBO's broadcast of John Oliver's \"Last Week Tonight\" interview with Snowden in Moscow.\n\nSome characterized the placement of Snowden's statue as an act of vandalism in support of a \"traitor,\" while others disagreed. The statue was up for only 12 to 13 hours before it was covered by blue tarpaulin and bound with rope at 12:30 pm on April 6, 2015, almost immediately after an official discovered it, then taken down an hour later. Calling it an \"art prank\", investigators from the New York City Police Department's Intelligence Division reportedly gathered DNA and examining other evidence in an attempt to determine the identity of the artist or artists. According to a spokesperson for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, \"[t]he erection of any unapproved structure or artwork in a city park is illegal.\" Some passersby were annoyed at the covering of the statue, however.\n\nThe bust was being held at the NYPD's 88th Precinct pending the investigation's outcome.\n\nHours after the statue was removed, a group of New York artists calling themselves The Illuminator Art Collective—unrelated to the three artists who created the statue—used smoke and projection equipment to create an ephemeral \"hologram\" image of Snowden in place of the missing sculpture. This projection included Snowden's face above one of the pillars, as well as \"Snowden\" in white letters at the bottom of the pillar. Collective artists said, \"Our feeling is that while the State may remove any material artifacts that speak in defiance against incumbent authoritarianism, the acts of resistance remain in the public consciousness. And it is in sharing that act of defiance that hope resides.\" The original artists said they were \"touched\" to see their bust and nameplate \"reinstalled\" with the use of light, adding that they were \"surprised to see the way the statue was covered up before its removal, as though it were a profane statement.\"\n\nNew York City has had a number of pieces of street art, like the \"Charging Bull\", which have become cultural icons and tourist attractions. It is uncertain whether this unsanctioned statue of Edward Snowden, considered just as valuable a work of art by some, will escape destruction. An online petition seeks the return of the statue to the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument.\n\nThe \"New York Daily News\" reported on April 14, 2015, that Ron Kuby, a lawyer representing the unidentified artists, had asked New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton to return the statue to its creators. Kuby stated, \"The statue itself is not contraband. Whatever the right of the Parks Department to remove an unauthorized sculpture, that does not translate into the right of the police to indefinitely detain a work of art.\" The artists planned to submit an application for authorized public display, and a Manhattan art gallery also expressed interest in exhibiting the Snowden sculpture.\n\nAfter negotiations with the artists' attorney, the city returned the sculpture on May 6, 2015, assessing each artist a $50 fine for non-criminal trespassing due to their having illegally entered Fort Greene Park at night. Ron Kuby promised his clients' fines would be \"promptly paid\", and expressed gratitude that potential removal and storage fees for the sculpture were waived. A police summons identified the artists as Andrew Tider and Jeff Greenspan.\n\nThe undamaged bust had its first post-police custody exhibition from May 8–17 at The Boiler in Brooklyn, in a show titled \"anonymity, no longer an option\". The artists were reportedly applying to have the sculpture legally exhibited by New York City through the city's \"Art in the Parks\" program: \"This time they're dotting their i's and crossing their t's,\" Kuby said.\n\nIt was thereafter exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum.\n\n"}
{"id": "750272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=750272", "title": "The Giving Tree", "text": "The Giving Tree\n\nThe Giving Tree is a children's picture book written and illustrated by Shel Silverstein. First published in 1964 by Harper & Row, it has become one of Silverstein's best known titles and has been translated into numerous languages.\n\nThis book has been described as \"one of the most divisive books in children's literature.\" The controversy concerns whether the relationship between the main characters (a boy and a tree) should be interpreted as positive (i.e., the tree gives the boy selfless love) or as negative (i.e., the boy and the tree have an abusive relationship).\n\nSilverstein had difficulty finding a publisher for \"The Giving Tree\". An editor at Simon & Schuster rejected the book's manuscript because he felt that it was \"too sad\" for children and \"too simple\" for adults. Tomi Ungerer encouraged Silverstein to approach Ursula Nordstrom, who was a publisher with Harper & Row.\n\nAn editor with Harper & Row stated that Silverstein had made the original illustrations \"scratchy\" like his cartoons for \"Playboy\", but that he later reworked the art in a \"more pared-down and much sweeter style.\" The final black-and-white drawings have been described as \"unadorned… visual minimalism.\" Harper & Row published a small first edition of the book, consisting of only 5,000–7,500 copies, in 1964.\n\nThe book follows the lives of a female apple tree and a boy, who develop a relationship with one another. The tree is very \"giving\" and the boy evolves into a \"taking\" teenager, man, then elderly man. Despite the fact that the boy ages in the story, the tree addresses the boy as \"Boy\" his entire life. \n\nIn his childhood, the boy enjoys playing with the tree, climbing her trunk, swinging from her branches, carving \"Me + T (Tree)\" into the bark, and eating her apples. However, as the boy grows older, he spends less time with the tree and tends to visit her only when he wants material items at various stages of his life, or not coming to the tree alone (such as bringing a lady friend to the tree and carving \"Me +Y.L.\" (her initials) into the tree. In an effort to make the boy happy at each of these stages, the tree gives him parts of herself, which he can transform into material items, such as money (from her apples), a house (from her branches), and a boat (from her trunk). With every stage of giving, \"the Tree was happy\". \n\nIn the final pages, both the tree and the boy feel the sting of their respective \"giving\" and \"taking\" nature. When only a stump remains for the tree (including the carving \"Me + T\"), she is not happy, at least at that moment. The boy does return as a tired elderly man to meet the tree once more. She tells him she is sad because she cannot provide him shade, apples, or any materials like in the past. He ignores this and states that all he wants is \"a quiet place to sit and rest,\" which the tree, who is weak being just a stump, could provide. With this final stage of giving, \"the Tree was happy\".\n\nInterest in the book increased by word of mouth; for example, in churches \"it was hailed as a parable on the joys of giving.\" As of 2001, over 5 million copies of the book had been sold, placing it 14th on a list of hardcover \"All-Time Bestselling Children's Books\" from \"Publishers Weekly.\" By 2011, 8.5 million copies of the book had been sold.\n\nIn a 1999–2000 National Education Association online survey of children, among the \"Kids' Top 100 Books,\" the book was 24th. Based on a 2007 online \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\" poll by the National Education Association, the book came in third. It was 85th of the \"Top 100 Picture Books\" of all time in a 2012 poll by \"School Library Journal\". \"Scholastic Parent & Child\" magazine placed it #9 on its list of \"100 Greatest Books for Kids\" in 2012. As of 2013, it ranked third on a Goodreads list of \"Best Children's Books.\"\n\nThe book has generated various opinions on how to interpret the relationship between the tree and the boy. Some possible interpretations include:\n\nUrsula Nordstrom attributed the book's success partially to \"Protestant ministers and Sunday-school teachers\", who believed that the tree represents \"the Christian ideal of unconditional love.\"\n\nSome people believe that the tree represents Mother Nature and the boy represents humanity. The book has been used to teach children environmental ethics. An educational resource for children describes the book as an \"allegory about the responsibilities a human being has for living organisms in the environment,\" Lisa Rowe Fraustino states that “some curricula use the book as a what-not-to-do role model.\" \n\nOne writer believes that the relationship between the boy and the tree is one of friendship. As such, the book teaches children \"as your life becomes polluted with the trappings of the modern world — as you 'grow up' — your relationships tend to suffer if you let them fall to the wayside.\" Another writer's criticism of this interpretation is that the tree appears to be an adult when the boy is young, and cross-generational friendships are rare.\n\nA common interpretation of the book is that the tree and the boy have a parent–child relationship, as in a 1995 collection of essays about the book edited by Richard John Neuhaus in the journal \"First Things\". Among the essayists, some were positive about the relationship; for example, Amy A. Kass wrote about the story that \"it is wise and it is true about giving and about motherhood,\" and her husband Leon R. Kass encourages people to read the book because the tree \"is an emblem of the sacred memory of our own mother's love.\" Other essayists put forth negative views. Mary Ann Glendon wrote that the book is \"a nursery tale for the 'me' generation, a primer of narcissism, a catechism of exploitation,\" and Jean Bethke Elshtain felt that the story ends with the tree and the boy \"both wrecks.\"\n\nA 1998 study using phenomenographic methods found that Swedish children and mothers tended to interpret the book as dealing with friendship, while Japanese mothers tended to interpret the book as dealing with parent–child relationships.\n\nSome authors believe that the book is not actually intended for children, but instead should be treated as a satire aimed at adults along the lines of \"A Modest Proposal\" by Jonathan Swift.\n\nElizabeth Bird, writing for the \"School Library Journal\", described \"The Giving Tree\" as \"one of the most divisive books in children's literature\". Criticism revolves about the depiction of the relationship between the boy and the tree.\nCritics of the book say that the boy never thanks the tree for its gifts. In an interview with \"Horn Book Magazine\", Phyllis J. Fogelman, an editor with Harper & Row, said the book is \"about a sadomasochistic relationship\" and \"elevates masochism to the level of a good\", which mirrors Mary Daly's analysis in \"Gyn/Ecology: the Metaethics of Radical Feminism\".\n\nOne college instructor discovered that the book caused both male and female remedial reading students to be angry because they felt that the boy exploited the tree. For teaching purposes, he paired the book with a short story by Andre Dubus entitled \"The Fat Girl\" because its plot can be described as \"The Giving Tree\" \"in reverse.\"\n\nThe photograph of Silverstein on the back cover of the book has attracted attention. One writer described the photograph as showing the author's \"jagged menacing teeth\" and \"evil, glaring eyes.\" Another writer compared the photograph to the one on the back of \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\" in which Silverstein resembles \"the Satanist Anton LaVey.\" In the book \"\", the father threatens the protagonist with the photograph to make sure that he does not leave his room at night.\n\nA short animated film of the book, produced in 1973, featured Silverstein's narration. \n\nSilverstein also wrote a song of the same name, which was performed by Bobby Bare and his family on his album \"Singin' in the Kitchen\" (1974).\n\nSilverstein created an adult version of the story in a cartoon entitled \"I Accept the Challenge.\" In the cartoon, a nude woman cuts off a nude man's arms and legs with scissors, then sits on his torso in a pose similar to the final drawing in \"The Giving Tree\" in which the old man sits on the stump.\n\nJackson and Dell (1979) wrote an \"alternative version\" of the story for teaching purposes that was entitled \"The Other Giving Tree.\" It featured two trees next to each other and a boy growing up. One tree acted like the one in \"The Giving Tree\", ending up as a stump, while the other tree stopped at giving the boy apples, and does not give the boy its branches or trunk. At the end of the story, the stump was sad that the old man chose to sit under the shade of the other tree.\n\nThe Giving Tree Band took its name from the book. Plain White T's EP \"Should've Gone to Bed\" has a song The Giving Tree, written by Tim Lopez.\n\nThe 2010 short film \"I'm Here\", written and directed by Spike Jonze, is based on \"The Giving Tree\"; the main character Sheldon is named after Shel Silverstein.\n\n\n"}

It is the third largest public park in Rome (80 hectares or 197.7 acres) after the ones of the Villa Doria Pamphili and Villa Ada. The gardens were developed for the Villa Borghese Pinciana (\"Borghese villa on the Pincian Hill\"), built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by Scipione Borghese, who used it as a \"villa suburbana\", a party villa, at the edge of Rome, and to house his art collection. The gardens as they are now were remade in the early nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1605, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew of Pope Paul V and patron of Bernini, began turning this former vineyard into the most extensive gardens built in Rome since Antiquity. The vineyard's site is identified with the gardens of Lucullus, the most famous in the late Roman republic. In the 19th century much of the garden's former formality was remade as a landscape garden in the English taste (\"illustration, right\"). The Villa Borghese gardens were long informally open, but were bought by the commune of Rome and given to the public in 1903. The large landscape park in the English taste contains several villas. The Spanish Steps lead up to this park, and there is another entrance at the Porte del Popolo by Piazza del Popolo. The \"Pincio\" (the Pincian Hill of ancient Rome), in the south part of the park, offers one of the greatest views over Rome.\n\nThe Piazza di Siena, located in the villa, hosted the equestrian dressage, individual jumping, and the jumping part of the eventing competition for the 1960 Summer Olympics. A balustrade (dating from the early seventeenth century) from the gardens, was taken to England in the late 19th century, and installed in the grounds of Cliveden House, a mansion in Buckinghamshire, in 1896. In 2004, a species of Italian snail was discovered, still living on the balustrade after more than 100 years in England.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The mural was painted by Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze in 1861 and symbolizes Manifest Destiny, the belief that the United States was destined for Western exploration and expansion originating from the initial colonies along the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific Ocean. A study measuring hangs in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.\n\nThe darkness turning into light represents the greatness that was believed to lie in the future West.\n\nLeutze combined pioneer men and women, mountain guides, wagons, and mules to suggest a divinely ordained pilgrimage to the Promised Land of the western frontier. Within the left half of the picture is a depiction of the entrance to the San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate, which is being pointed to by the pilgrim seated atop the rock in the foreground. Within the right hemisphere of the painting is a depiction of a valley, representing the Valley of Darkness and symbolic of the troubles faced by explorers. The imagery is familiar imperial iconography and is regarded as a symbol of American exceptionalism and the realization of Manifest Destiny, ultimately leading to the evolution of the American Empire.\n\nThe painting takes its inspiration from the closing lines of George Berkeley's \"Verses on the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America:\n\n<poem>\nWestward the course of empire takes its way; \nThe first four Acts already past, \nA fifth shall close the Drama with the day; \nTime's noblest offspring is the last.\n</poem>\n\nThe imagery of the pilgrim gesturing on a high rock is very similar to the 5 cent postage stamp, \"Fremont in the Rocky Mountains\" that was part of the 1898 Trans-Mississippi Issue, and reprinted a century later.\n\nA Currier and Ives print from 1868 uses the same title and theme for a very different print, showing a railroad crossing a new settlement as the train goes west.\n\nA and a stereograph by Alexander Gardner, both of an 1867 end-of-track frontier construction train, were titled \"Westward The Course of Empire Takes Its Way\".\n\nDavid Foster Wallace named one of his short stories \"Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way\" in his 1989 collection \"Girl with Curious Hair\".\n\nEarly revisions of the 1995 computer game \"Oregon Trail II\" depict the study version of this painting on the title screen.\n"}
{"id": "39523687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39523687", "title": "Zamorano Eighty", "text": "Zamorano Eighty\n\nThe Zamorano Eighty is a list of books intended to represent the most significant early volumes published on the history of California. It was compiled in 1945 by members of the Zamorano Club, a Los Angeles-based group of bibliophiles. Collecting first editions of every volume on the list has become the goal of a number of book collectors, though to date only four people have completed the task.\n\nThe Zamorano Club was founded in 1928 and named for Agustín Vicente Zamorano, the first printer in California. A series of committees of Club members, including former American Smelting and Refining Company executive Henry Raup Wagner and bibliographer Robert Cowan, assembled a list of a hundred books, eventually whittled down to eighty. During this process, Cowan died, and his \"Bibliography of the History of California and the Pacific West\" was added to the list as a tribute.\n\nThe list contains significant works by a number of well-known authors like Mark Twain, John Muir, Bret Harte, and Robert Louis Stevenson, as well as obscure texts concerning geographical exploration and legal matters. Some of the works exist in very few, highly sought after copies, while others were quite common and not particularly valuable, until interest in the list caused their prices to rise. Book dealers often refer to items for sale using their \"Zamorano number\" or have special sections dedicated to items on the list.\n\nThomas Streeter was the first collector to assemble a complete collection of first editions of every item on the list. His collection was auctioned between 1966 and 1969. Businessman Frederick William Beinecke was the second. Retired investment counselor Henry H. Clifford completed his collection in 1988 and his collection was auctioned in 1995. The fourth was architect Daniel Volkmann, who completed his collection in 1994, and it was auctioned in 2003. Many other collectors have pursued this goal, including notorious bibliomane and book thief Stephen Blumberg.\n\nOnly one institution, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, possesses a complete collection of the Zamorano 80, donated by Frederick W. Beinecke. Both the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley and the Huntington Library in San Marino, California possess all but one of the volumes.\n\nThe rarest book on the list is number 64, the dime novel \"The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murieta\" by John Rollin Ridge writing as \"Yellow Bird\". Only two first-edition copies are known to exist, each used twice to complete the list. It may be on the list only because Wagner owned a copy, which he sold to Streeter. When Streeter's collection was being periodically auctioned, the auction of this copy was moved up over a year so the elderly Beinecke would be able to complete his Zamorano collection. This copy is now in the Beinecke Library with the rest of Beinecke's Zamorano books. Clifford purchased the second copy from a collector in Maine, which in turn was purchased by Volkmann at the auction of Clifford's collection. The book has been described with terms like \"Holy Grail\" and \"rara avis\" and is highly desired by collectors. Blumberg wanted it so much he and his accomplices planned and researched a potential burglary of Clifford's house when that collector owned the book. \n\nThe works on the list are numbered in alphabetical order by author (or title, in the case of numbers 14, 35, and 62) and were not intended to be any sort of ranking of literary or financial value.\n\n"}
