{"id": "33339692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33339692", "title": "Amakhosi Theatre", "text": "Amakhosi Theatre\n\nAmakhosi Theatre Productions (also known as Amakhosi Academy of Performing Arts) is a Zimbabwean theatre company based at the Amakhosi Township Square Cultural Centre in Makokoba township, Bulawayo. The company was established under its current name in 1981 by Cont Mhlanga,\nand has since become an influential cultural institution in Zimbabwe, playing a role not only in stimulating the performance arts scene, but also in examining critical issues in politics, health, women's rights and development with urban and rural communities through a method of active audience engagement.\n\nThe group's origins go back to 1979 when Mhlanga and his Dragons Karate Club colleagues turned up one day for their training session at Makokoba's Stanley Hall and found the hall booked for a theatre workshop. The karate club members attended the workshop out of curiosity, and it was during this experience that their enthusiasm for theatre was first ignited.\nCont Mhlanga began to attend theatre workshops in Bulawayo and Harare in 1980 and 1981 (in the newly independent Zimbabwe), from which he would return to share newly acquired skills with his karate club. In 1981, the Dragons Karate Club officially renamed itself “Amakhosi Productions”.\n\nThe performers became highly active in the township of Makokoba and beyond. By 1990 the group had performed 295 times on stage, and grown to 110 active members. Initially Cont Mhlanga was the sole writer, director and producer of all the plays. However, later other Amakhosi playwrights, such as Cont's brother Styx Mhlanga, were to make contributions to the company’s extensive repertoire, while the company expanded and diversified.\n\nAmakhosi was founded within a unique historical and cultural context. Prior to Zimbabwe’s 1980 attainment of political independence, Rhodesian cultural and social life was polarised.\n\nThe Senior Drama Lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe, Owen Seda, notes that \"as a conquest society, colonial Rhodesia was in dire need of legitimacy in its values and existence as a domineering settler society…Through theatre and other arts, western civilisation was contrasted with the lives of indigenous people who were regarded as uncivilised and without a culture.\"\n\nIt was inevitable that after independence this segregation of Zimbabwean theatre would continue. Indeed, for the first decade following Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980, the National Theatre Organisation (a colonial establishment) continued its support of exclusive white amateur theatre companies. In this context, Amakhosi emerged as a strand of revolutionary black nationalist theatre, critical not only of colonialism, but also of the post-independence leadership which it characterised as hypocritical and corrupt.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Association of Community based Theatres (ZATC), established six years after independence, promoted indigenous township theatre, with the aim of encouraging cultural equality. However, black and white theatre traditions remained confrontational throughout the 1980s. At the onset of the 1990s, the attempts by various cultural activists (such as Cont Mhlanga) to break racial divisions in the arts resulted in a \"process of transculturalism and hybridity in post-independence Zimbabwean theatre; leading to production of plays that resonate with traditional forms of African theatre infused with elements of western drama…(producing) theatre works of outstanding cultural and artistic merit.\"\n\nIn the play \"Workshop Negative\" (see below) in 1986, Amakhosi showed its willingness from early on to collaborate across the divide (in this case with Chris Hurst, a white Zimbabwean actor from the exclusive white theatre tradition.)\n\nCont Mhlanga has been described by theatre expert Jane Plastow as \"a product of urban township life\", in contrast to many other African playwrights who hail from the elite classes.\n\nMhlanga's first plays – \"Children Children\" (1983), \"Book of Lies\" (1983) and \"Diamond Warriors\" (1983) – were performed in English, with little dialogue and extensive use of karate. Their themes were political – about colonisation, the theft of Africa’s cultural heritage and its natural wealth.\n\"Ngizozula Lawe\" (1984) was the first play in isiNdebele, the local language of Matabeleland, and was consequently a breakthrough for Amakhosi. It involved elderly dancers from the Bulawayo Traditional Dancers' Association, whose participation in the performance, according to Professor Caleb Dube, \"legitimised Amakhosi’s existence\". \n\nThe theatre group had an agenda, as Mhlanga recounts: \"The intention was to make the group known in Makokoba, make it a local institution…We wanted what we did to be of significance to a local audience, and they should be able to recognise themselves in what we were doing. So the lines in the plays were to a large extent based on what I heard people saying and the way they talked, in the workplace, in bars and so on.\"\n\nHaving captured the attention and admiration of the Makokoba people with \"Nansi Lendoda\" in 1985, which won five National Theatre Organization awards, the theatre group expanded beyond the township.\n\nFrom 1985 the actors began to engage their audiences in 'discussion theatre', often entering into controversial social, political and cultural topic areas. \n\nOne such 'discussion theatre' performance – \"Workshop Negative\" (1986) – which the group had wanted to take on tour in Botswana and Zambia, was cut short as it did not receive \"the Government’s blessing\", due to its highly critical portrayal of the country’s leaders as hypocritical and corrupt. The controversial banning of the play, and the implications this had for other artists' freedom of expression, caused a deep sense of unease in the arts community. The Writers' Union saw the episode as a fundamental challenge to free speech, and it was to signify just the beginning of Amakhosi’s many issues with oppressive authorities.\n\n\"Citizen Mind\", produced in 1986, urged a revitalisation of Zimbabwean traditional cultures, arguing that they should be the basis for future development. \"Cry-Isilio\" (1987/88) dealt with the capitalist system and its perpetual repression of workers, as well as sexual harassment of under-privileged women.\n\"Stitsha\" (1990) dealt with many serious issues of crime, unemployment, corruption, and the suppression of women. The play was taken on a European tour in 1990.\n\nIn 1990 the company branched out to radio with \"Ngokwako Sgadula\" (a popular serial about family planning), and TV with \"Tshada Laye\", a screen play about marriage and divorce (13 episodes).\n\nMany plays and European tours followed in the 1990s. Several Amakhosi dancers and actors, such as Alois Moyo, have risen to prominence in the Zimbabwean theatre scene, or have headed abroad to advance their careers in South Africa and Europe. Zimbabwe's significant political and economic upheaval since 1999 has created serious setbacks for the theatre, both financially, and in the stifling of free expression. Cont Mhlanga has won several awards for his work, including the Freedom to Create Prize in 2008, for \"practising protest theatre and challenging state ideologies in Zimbabwe for over 25 years. He has been the target of state surveillance, intimidation, harassment, arrest and detention.\"\n\nAmakhosi Theatre has initiated several projects and collaborations with African and European organisations, and received vital funding support for its activities, mainly from Scandinavia, through NGOs such as NORAD, DANIDA and HiVOS. Its main venue, the \"Amakhosi Township Square Cultural Centre\", with its offices, library, practice rooms, bar and open air stage, is a cultural hub hosting performances, concerts, dance and theatre workshops.\n\nFor much of the decade since the year 2000, Amakhosi Productions has lacked sufficient funding and revenue to support the level of activity that it was previously able to sustain. However, at a new alternative venue in 2011, in Bulawayo City centre - the Amakhosi Elite 400 (already described as \"Zimbabwe's premiere arts and culture hub\") - the company has attempted to revive its activities and host a diverse array of performance events.\n\nVoices From Zimbabwe began with a statement by Cont Mhlanga from the Amakhosi Theatre in 2007, announcing the launch of a movement to \"support creative artists from all disciplines to produce, perform, distribute and amplify the voices of the majority who live in Difficult Times while exposing the trickery and hypocrisy of the minority who live in Good Times, while they claim to be acting on behalf of the people and the country, by taking such critical and sometimes protest works to the people by all means available and possible.\"\n\nEstablished in 2001, this programme, uses a particular methodology created by the Amakhosi Theatre to \"support and involve rural community members in the fight against HIV/AIDS\" through the effective use of drama.\nIt incorporates folk media like song, dance and narrative with spontaneous participation, to communicate the issue of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n(In interviews Mhlanga emphasises that theatre is a part of people’s everyday activity, and in the African context it must diverge in some sense from the Western notion of theatre.) The initial TCA practical theatre skills training programme lasted 1 year and taught the TCA methodology to 7 districts in Matabeleland province, which resulted in plays being performed to 80 000 people. The organizers stated that “community theatre can take the message to the people, instead of getting people to the theatre”. Amakhosi’s TCA development methodology is continuing to be implemented by Amakhosi in Zimbabwe, and other development groups elsewhere in Africa. The Theatre has received substantial funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) for \"addressing HIV/AIDS and Promoting Gender Equality through Music and Theatre.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Styx Mhlanga continues to implement a new project in Matabeleland, teaching secondary school literature texts to students by working with them on theatrical adaptations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5017604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5017604", "title": "American Gangster (film)", "text": "American Gangster (film)\n\nAmerican Gangster is a 2007 American biographical crime film directed and produced by Ridley Scott and written by Steven Zaillian. The film is fictionally based on the criminal career of Frank Lucas, a gangster from La Grange, North Carolina who smuggled heroin into the United States on American service planes returning from the Vietnam War, before being detained by a task force led by detective Richie Roberts. The film stars Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in their first lead acting roles together since 1995's \"Virtuosity\". The film also co-stars Ted Levine, John Ortiz, Josh Brolin, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Norman Reedus, Ruby Dee, Lymari Nadal and Cuba Gooding Jr.\n\nDevelopment for the film initially began in 2000, when Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment purchased the rights to a \"New York\" magazine story about the rise and fall of Lucas. Two years later, screenwriter Steven Zaillian introduced a 170-page scriptment to Scott. Original production plans were to commence in Toronto for budget purposes; however, production eventually relocated permanently to New York City. Because of the film's rising budget Universal canceled production in 2004. After negotiations with Terry George, it was later revived with Scott at the helm in March 2005. Principal photography commenced over a period of five months from July to December 2006; filming took place throughout New York City and concluded in Thailand.\n\n\"American Gangster\" premiered in New York on October 20, 2007, and was released in the United States and Canada on November 2. The film was well received by most film critics, and grossed over US$266.5 million worldwide, with domestic grosses standing at $130.1 million. Many of the people portrayed, including Roberts and Lucas, have stated that the film took a lot of creative license with the story, and three former DEA agents sued Universal claiming the agency's portrayal was demoralizing. \"American Gangster\" was nominated for twenty-one awards, including two Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Supporting Actress (Ruby Dee), and won three including a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role for Dee.\n\nIn 1968, Frank Lucas is the right-hand man of Harlem gangster Ellsworth \"Bumpy\" Johnson. When Johnson dies of a heart attack, Lucas takes control of the Harlem crime scene.\n\nAfter handing in almost $1 million that he found in a mobster's car, Newark detective Richie Roberts is ostracized in his precinct. After his exiled and addicted partner overdoses on a potent brand of heroin called \"Blue Magic\", Captain Lou Toback puts Roberts in charge of a task force that targets local suppliers. Lucas buys Blue Magic directly from producers in Thailand and smuggles it into the U.S. through returning Vietnam War servicemen. His low overhead allows him to eventually wholesale Blue Magic to most of the dealers in the New York area. With this monopoly, Lucas expands his control to nightclubs, casinos, and prostitution. He buys a mansion for his mother and recruits his five brothers, including Huey and Turner, as lieutenants to spread his empire. During his rise to becoming Harlem's crime boss, Lucas falls in love with Eva, a Puerto Rican beauty queen.\n\nAs Lucas' business prospers, he makes a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the Fight of the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.\n\nRoberts' detectives witness Frank Lucas' cousin and driver shoot a woman and then use the threat of a long sentence to get him to wear a wire. The gathered information allows Roberts and his task force to identify and search one of the last planes carrying Lucas' stock, discovering Blue Magic in the coffins of dead returning servicemen. With this evidence they obtain a warrant to follow the drugs into Newark's projects and Lucas' heroin processing facility. In the ensuing shootout, Steve Lucas, Frank Lucas' young nephew who gave up a promising career for the New York Yankees to join Lucas' crime family, is killed. Meanwhile, Trupo, whose prized Shelby Mustang Lucas had destroyed, and his men break into Lucas' mansion to steal his emergency cash supply hidden under the doghouse, killing the dog. As Lucas gets ready to go after Trupo, his mother dissuades him from killing a cop, warning him that she and Eva will leave him if he does. Lucas is arrested after Roberts' team conducts a raid on the shops run by his brothers.\n\nIn the police station, Lucas offers to bribe Roberts, but is rebuffed. Instead, Roberts offers Lucas a chance at a shorter jail sentence if he aids his investigation of dirty cops in the NYPD and Lucas duly provides Roberts with the names. In the end, three quarters of the New York DEA are arrested and convicted, and a distraught Trupo commits suicide. Roberts, having just passed the bar exam, defends Lucas as his first client. Lucas is sentenced to 70 years in prison, of which he serves 15 years and is released in 1991.\n\nIn 2000, Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment purchased the rights to \"The Return of Superfly\", a \"New York\" magazine story by Mark Jacobson about the rise and fall of the 1970s heroin kingpin Frank Lucas. In 2002, screenwriter Steven Zaillian brought a 170-page script to director Ridley Scott, who expressed interest in making two films from it. However, Scott did not immediately pursue the project, choosing to make \"Kingdom of Heaven\" instead. In November 2003, Universal and Imagine entered negotiations with Brian De Palma to direct \"Tru Blu\", with a script by Zaillian based on Frank Lucas. Zaillian interpreted the story as one of \"American business and race\", focusing the script thematically on corporate business. Production was initially slated for a spring 2004 start. In March 2004, the studio entered new negotiations with Antoine Fuqua to direct, as well as Denzel Washington to star in the film as Frank Lucas. The following May, Benicio del Toro entered negotiations to star as Detective Richie Roberts, who brought down Lucas. Production of \"Tru Blu\" was reset to begin in early fall 2004, with the film slated for a release date of June 3, 2005. In September 2004, Dania Ramirez entered negotiations to join the cast of the film, now titled \"American Gangster\".\n\nUniversal Pictures reported that it greenlit \"American Gangster\" with a budget of $80 million, which escalated to $93 million, with $10 million for development costs and $3 million for the delay of the production start date. Sources close to the director insist that the budget was $93 million from the beginning. The studio also sought for \"American Gangster\" to be produced in Toronto rather than New York City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location. The studio's parent company General Electric received tax credits in New York City, so production was moved to the city. The move, however, inflated the budget to $98 million. Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking ways to reduce the budget, but the studio contended several aspects of the project under him. The director had wanted to film a Vietnam sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as Ray Liotta and John C. Reilly in minor roles. To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was rewriting the script during the preproduction process. The director also did not have a shot-list, final locations, and supporting actors signed to initiate production.\n\nFuqua was fired on October 1, 2004, four weeks before principal photography would begin. The studio cited creative differences for the director's departure. After Fuqua's departure, the studio met with Peter Berg to take over directing the film, and Denzel Washington had approved of the choice. Due to the search potentially escalating a budget already in the US$80 million range and the difficulty in recouping the amount based on the film's subject matter, Universal canceled production of \"American Gangster\", citing time constraints and creative elements for its reason. The cancellation cost the studio $30 million, of which $20 million went to Washington and $5 million went to del Toro due to their pay or play contracts.\nIn March 2005, \"American Gangster\" was revived as Universal and Imagine entered negotiations with Terry George to revise Zaillian's script and direct the film, which was to be financed with a target budget of US $50 million. Will Smith was approached to replace Washington as Frank Lucas, though an offer would be held off until George completed his revision of the script. George cut many key scenes, characters and Asian locations to reduce costs, but the project failed to progress given financial problems and Grazer feeling they \"couldn't make it right\" without the removed material.\n\nAfter a meeting between Scott and Zaillian on another project, Zaillian brought the project up again with Scott, who decided he was ready to do it. Producer Brian Grazer and Imagine executive Jim Whitaker decided against pursuing George's attempt and to return to Zaillian's vision. In February 2006, Ridley Scott entered talks with the studio to take over \"American Gangster\" from George, returning to Zaillian's draft as the film's basis. Washington returned to his role as Lucas, and Russell Crowe was attached to star as Roberts. Crowe was drawn to the project based on his previous work with the director on \"Gladiator\" and \"A Good Year\", while Washington wanted to work with Crowe again, after 1995's \"Virtuosity\". Production was slated in summer 2006.\n\nScott had discussed the script with Crowe as they worked on \"A Good Year\" in France, and they sought to take on the project. The director reviewed Zaillian's script, Terry George's rewrite, and a revision by Richard Price during the project's incarnation with director Antoine Fuqua. Scott preferred Zaillian's approach and chose to follow it. In realizing the project, the director encountered a challenge in the script since the characters Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts do not encounter each other until twenty minutes before the end of the film. The director sought to flesh out the private universes of the characters that would evolve and have scenes cut between the two characters to provide a balance. Elements like Frank Lucas's interaction with his family and Richie Roberts' dysfunctional marriage were written to add to the characters' backgrounds. The rappers T.I., RZA and Common were added to the cast to appeal to younger audiences.\nScott chose to direct \"American Gangster\" based on the paradoxical values of Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. The film somewhat focuses on the comparatively ethical business practices of the \"wicked gangster\" and the womanizing and failed marriage of the \"do-gooder\" police detective. Washington, who was not normally a fan of gangster films, chose to portray Lucas when he saw \"the arc of the character\" had ended with prices that Lucas paid for his actions. To prepare for their roles, the actors met their real-life counterparts. Washington acquired Lucas's Southern accent, and Crowe practiced to match Roberts's manner of speaking and body language, requesting tape recordings of Roberts to assist in his preparation. The following March, the studio rehired Zaillian to rewrite the script for \"American Gangster\". It was rumored that Washington got paid another $20 million for when the project was greenlit again; that rumor proved to be false, as he signed on for his gross. The budget had escalated to $100 million, which Grazer stated was unexpected given \"It's not a high-concept comedy, it's not a fantasy movie, it's not a four-quadrant movie\". Grazer and Scott still had to pay back the studio $3 million for a budget overrun.\n\nPrincipal photography began in July 2006 in New York City. \"American Gangster\" was filmed over a period of approximately four months in over 180 different locations, most of them across New York; it set the record for containing the highest number of filming locations of a movie. Two months were spent in New York, with all the city's five boroughs being used. Approximately fifty to sixty locations were set in Harlem alone. While in the neighbourhood, Scott stated that he found several interiors that had been untouched since the 1940s. According to production designer Arthur Max, exhaustive location scouting was done to find parts of New York that could still resemble the city of the early 1970s, filming Lucas' headquarters at 116th Street 20 blocks north, on 136th Street. In his interview with ComingSoon.net, Scott stated that \"[he] just walked in [...] and [...] just sho[o]t in the house.\" Several gas masks were brought by producers due to health hazards and sanitary concerns existing in the buildings. Scott found filming in Harlem to be difficult, commenting that the rapid gentrification in Harlem provided poor opportunities for shooting angles. Hand-held cameras were extensively used to depict a \"guerrilla filmmaking\" style.\n\nOther locations for principal photography include the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, Old Westbury Gardens, a segment of the George Washington Bridge, and the Brooklyn Supreme Courthouse. Briarcliff Manor in upstate New York had the locations for both the Lucas farm and the estate Lucas buys for his family. Filming locations began setting up in Thailand in November 2006, after Branko Lustig consulted with Suvit Yodmanee, the country's tourism minister. Filming for \"American Gangster\" concluded in Chiang Mai the following month.\n\nUsing his experience from visiting New York in the same time period in which the film's story took place, Scott sought to downplay a \"Beatles\" atmosphere to the film and to instead create a shabbier atmosphere, saying that \"Harlem was really, really shabby, beautiful brownstones falling apart.\" Production and costume design was emphasized, transforming the location into the rundown streets of upper Manhattan from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Denzel Washington, as Frank Lucas, went through 64 different costume changes.\n\nIn 2006, Greg Calloway was approached by producers to produce a soundtrack for the film. He presented the idea to Atlantic Records chairman Craig Kallman, and one of the company's artists, T.I., got an acting role in the film. However, the deal did not go further because Universal Pictures owned the rights to the film; \"It was a Universal film and they were not going to give the soundtrack to WMG\" (Atlantic's parent company). Thus Scott brought back Marc Streitenfeld, who had worked with him in \"A Good Year\". The composer stated that \"the overall tone needed to be something bigger and darker\" given the characters' strong personalities, and while not being the original intention, he added shades of blues and soul music to fit the 1970s setting. The musical score for \"American Gangster\" was recorded between April and May 2007 by Streitenfeld, with the help of orchestrator Bruce Fowler and conductor Mike Nowak, using an 80-piece orchestra recorded in sections as well as acoustic pre-records, performed by Streitenfeld himself. Additional score material was composed and recorded by Hank Shocklee.\n\nThe official soundtrack album for \"American Gangster\" was released by Def Jam Recordings within a week of the film's release. In addition to Streitenfeld and Shocklee's score material, the soundtrack album also features songs influenced by music in the 1960s and 1970s, including from blues and soul musicians such as Bobby Womack, The Staple Singers, Sam & Dave, and John Lee Hooker. Grazer stated that \"I wanted to introduce a visual and sonic world that is a contained entity of the '70s\", and Scott felt it was vital to have \"the brand of music that was Harlem at the time.\"\n\nDenzel Washington pressed Grazer into inviting rapper Jay-Z to write the film's score, but the producer \"just didn't think there'd be enough for Jay-Z to do\" given the intentions to do a soundtrack filled with 1970s music. The film's trailer had already used Jay-Z's \"Heart of the City (Ain't No Love)\", and the rapper was invited to an advanced screening. The film had a profound resonance on the musician, who decided to create a concept album, also entitled \"American Gangster\". The rapper recorded tracks that were prompted by specific scenes in the film. It was speculated that the album's release in conjunction with the film would attract a young audience and help Universal Pictures generate profits to recover from the film's troubled development history. According to Jay-Z: \n\n\"It was like I was watching the film, and putting it on pause, and giving a back story to the story. It immediately clicked with me. Like \"Scarface\" or any one of those films, you take the good out of it, and you can see it as an inspiring film.\"\n\n\"American Gangster\" premiered in Harlem at the Apollo Theater on October 20, 2007. Over two weeks before the release of \"American Gangster\", a screener for the film leaked online. The film debuted in the United States and Canada on November 2, 2007 in 3,054 theaters.\n\nIn its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, it grossed an estimated $43.6 million, averaging $14,264 per theater, placing the film first in the weekend box office. It marked the biggest opening weekend out of any film in both Washington and Crowe's careers. In its second week, grosses declined by 44.8 percent to $24 million, being beaten out by \"Bee Movie\". In contrast by its third week, screenings for \"American Gangster\" increased to 3,110 theaters as the film surpassed the $100 million mark. \"American Gangster\" finished its box office run in North America with $130,164,645.\n\nThe film experienced similar success overseas. \"American Gangster\" was released in the United Kingdom on November 16, and became the highest-grossing film of the week, garnering £2.6 million ($5.3 million) in the box office. It repeated the feat in its second week, grossing an estimated £1.82 million ($3.7 million) at the box office and beating out \"Beowulf\" two consecutive times. The weekend of November 16–18 saw \"American Gangster\" take $14.7 million from fourteen territories internationally. At the same time, \"American Gangster\" expanded in the European market; it received $2.8 million from 366 theaters in Germany and $3.6 million from 366 screens in France during its opening weekend. Releases followed in Norway and Sweden the succeeding week, where it earned $392,608 and $465,238 from thirty-seven and fifty-nine theaters, respectively. The film was released in the United Arab Emirates during the film's sixth week, and grossed a modest $281,922 at the box office during its first week in the emirate. Similarly, it earned $6.9 million in international markets during its sixth week, adding the total at the time to $40.9 million.\n\nBy January 25, 2008, \"American Gangster\" opened in thirty-seven markets, bringing international grosses to $93 million. In February, screenings for the film debuted in Mexico—with a modest $820,482 opening weekend—and Japan, where it opened at the box office with $2.3 million, landing in second place. \"American Gangster\" grossed over $266.5 million worldwide at the box office, with international grosses making up 51 percent ($136.3 million). It ranked as the 19th highest-grossing film of 2007 both domestically and worldwide.\n\n\"American Gangster\" was released in DVD and HD DVD format on February 19, 2008. The home release included an unrated extended version of the film, featuring 18 additional minutes and an alternative ending. The film topped both the DVD sales charts with 4 million units during its first week in stores, more than three times as many copies as second place \"Michael Clayton\", and the rental charts. \"American Gangster\" ended up as the 14th best-selling DVD of 2008. It also topped the high-definition charts despite being released in the same week Toshiba announced it would discontinue the HD DVD format. On October 14, the film saw its release on Blu-ray.\n\nA mobile game based on the film was released by Gameloft on November 1.\n\nReview aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 80% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 212 reviews, with a rating average of 7/10, with the consensus being: \"\"American Gangster\" is a gritty and entertaining throwback to classic gangster films, with its lead performers firing on all cylinders.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean score out of 100 to reviews from film critics, the film has a score of 76 based on 38 reviews.\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film a perfect four star rating and opined, \"This is an engrossing story, told smoothly and well.\" Ebert also praised Crowe's performance, saying that his contribution to the storytelling was \"enormous\". \nPaul Byrnes of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" felt that \"American Gangster\" was \"one of the most intelligent gangster films in years\" and expressed that the film offers \"the spectacle of grand themes and two bigger-than-life characters played by two of the best actors in cinema.\" Concluding his review, Byrnes gave the film four out of four stars. IGN's Jim \"Stax\" Vejvoda rated the film four out of five stars, praising the acting—particularly of the two protagonists, \"both dynamic presences on-screen, with neither actor outweighing the other's importance to the story\"—and declaring that despite being preceded by other gangster stories such as \"Scarface\" and \"The Sopranos\", \"American Gangster\" managed to justify its existence with \"emphasis on the human and class elements of the story\". Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" strongly commended the film, opining that \"greatness hovers just outside \"American Gangster\".\" She continued: \"It's a seductive package, crammed with all the on-screen and off-screen talent that big-studio money can buy, and filled with old soul and remixed funk that evoke the city back in the day, when heroin turned poor streets white and sometimes red.\" These sentiments were echoed by Sukhdev Sandhu of \"The Telegraph\", who asserted that the storyline was \"amazing\".\n\nIn comparison, some reviewers were more critical of \"American Gangster\". Jonathan Crocker of \"Time Out London\" was polarized with the film, criticizing its aesthetics. In his review, he wrote, \"Scott's meticulous aesthetics can’t touch the urban texture and deep focus of \"The French Connection\", \"The Godfather\", \"Serpico\" and \"Prince of the City\" – all looming heavily in intertextual nods.\" In contrast, Crocker praised Washington's acting, writing, \"He's immense: centering every scene with tractor-beam charisma, that dangerous, easy charm hovering between a luxury smile or blazing violence.\" In conclusion, Crocker gave the film three out of five stars. Similarly, Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a 'C-' grade, expressing that \"American Gangster\" is \"never dull, but it could have used more good old-fashioned melodramatic intrigue.\" Gleiberman found Washington's performance to have \"a ghastly ingenuity\". \"Empire\"s Ian Freer rated the film three stars out of five; he stated that it was \"undeniably enjoyable\" and praised the cast, but also noted that he felt that \"very little in the movie feels fresh, re-treading scenes, riffs and imagery from the whole history of crime flicks\" and that the film did not explore enough of Lucas' story and Scott's visual imagination. Slant Magazine journalist Nick Schager harshly criticized the film, giving the film a one out of four stars. Schager remarked that the film was \"dumb as a rock\", and that it was \"far too convinced of its import to be any fun.\" Giving \"American Gangster\" a two out of five stars, Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" was disappointed with Washington's acting, asserting, \"He doesn't seem to relax and enjoy himself in the role, or even inhabit it very satisfyingly.\" He resumed: \"He never has the menace of his dirty cop in \"Training Day\", and we don't see anything like the transformation from street-hustler to leader in \"Malcolm X\". That shoulder-shimmying swagger is rarely seen, and the brand-classic robes of \"American Gangster\" sit on him heavily.\"\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC, Lucas expressed his excitement about the film and amazement at Denzel Washington's portrayal. However, Lucas admitted to several news outlets that only a small portion of the film was true, and that much of it was fabricated for dramatic effect. In addition, Richie Roberts criticized the film for portraying him in a custody battle while in real life he never had a child. Roberts criticized the portrayal of Lucas, describing it as \"almost noble\".\n\nSterling Johnson Jr., a federal judge who served as a special narcotics prosecutor for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and assisted the arrest and trial of Lucas, described the film as \"one percent reality and ninety-nine percent Hollywood.\" In addition, Johnson described the real life Lucas as \"illiterate, vicious, violent, and everything Denzel Washington was not.\" Former DEA agents Jack Toal, Gregory Korniloff, and Louis Diaz filed a lawsuit against Universal saying that the events in the film were fictionalized and that the film defamed them and hundreds of other agents. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed by US District Judge Colleen McMahon. While McMahon noted that the intertitle that appears at the end of the film, stating that Lucas' collaboration led to the arrest of many corrupt DEA agents, was \"wholly inaccurate\", in that Lucas' cooperation did not lead to the convictions, and admonished that \"It would behoove a major corporation like Universal (which is owned by a major news organization, NBC) not to put inaccurate statements at the end of popular films\", she stated that the film failed to meet legal standards of defamation because it failed to \"show a single person who is identifiable as a DEA agent\".<ref name=\"ABC/Reuters\"></ref>\n\nMany of Lucas' other claims, as presented in the film, have also been called into question, such as being the right-hand man of Bumpy Johnson, rising above the power of the Mafia and Nicky Barnes, and that he was the mastermind behind the Golden Triangle heroin connection of the 1970s. Ron Chepesiuk, a biographer of Frank Lucas, deemed the story as a myth. Associated Press entertainment writer Frank Coyle noted that \"this mess happened partly because journalists have been relying on secondary sources removed from the actual events.\"\n\n\"American Gangster\" earned various awards and nominations, in categories ranging from recognition of the film itself to its screenplay and music, to the performances of Ruby Dee and Denzel Washington. Prior to the film's release, it was observed as a candidate for the Academy Awards based on its style and the performances of its actors, including the possibility of an Academy Award for Best Director for Ridley Scott. It received two Academy Award nominations—Ruby Dee was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, and Arthur Max and Beth A. Rubino (set decoration) were up for Best Art Direction. At the 14th Screen Actors Guild Awards, the film received two nominations, of which Dee won the award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role, and the cast's overall performances earned the nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. At the 12th Satellite Awards, Pietro Scalia attained an award for Best Editing.\n\n\"American Gangster\" was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, including a nomination for Best Motion Picture – Drama. At the 61st British Academy Film Awards, the film was nominated for five awards, but ultimately lost out. The film was up for four Satellite Awards, winning Best Editing. \"American Gangster\" was awarded Best Thriller at the 13th Empire Awards, and recognized as a candidate for best film by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Broadcast Film Critics Association. In addition, the film was included on 54 reviewer lists of the ten best films of 2007, three of them at the top spot. Among the lists ranking \"American Gangster\" as one of the best of the year were those of \"The Miami Herald\", \"Rolling Stone\" and the Associated Press.\n\n\n"}

They are generally a producer and director, but not in the sense of a mogul, since the organization is generally a non-profit organization. The artistic director of a theatre company is the individual with the overarching artistic control of the theatre's production choices, directorial choices, and overall artistic vision. In smaller theatres, the artistic director may be the founder of the theatre and the primary director of its plays. In larger non-profit theatres (often known in Canada and the United States as regional theatres), the artistic director may be appointed by the board of directors.\n\nThe artistic director of a performing arts company is similar to the musical director of an orchestra, the primary person responsible for planning a company's season. The artistic director's responsibilities can include (but are not limited to) choosing the material staged in a season, the hiring of creative/production personnel (such as directors), and other theatre management tasks. He or she may also direct productions for the company. Artistic directors work closely with the general manager of the theatre, and contribute the artistic evaluation of projects and productions to be included in promotional, funding, and press materials. An artistic director also functions as a resource for the directors who are working to mount productions at the theatre and can provide support, counsel, and/or artistic input where requested. The artistic director is usually prepared to assume the production should the director become unable to complete his/her duties. Artistic directors are frequently regarded as the artistic representatives of theatre companies and are often required to speak about their theatre to the press. In the United States, artistic directors often have fundraising responsibilities as well. \n\nIn some ensemble companies, the artistic director is responsible for recruiting performers to act as a talent pool for the company's productions. This ensemble may include actors and artists of various disciplines. The artistic director functions as leader of this group, with the aim to create and/or realize various new and established works. \n\nIn ballet, the artistic director is the head of a ballet company. They have overall responsibility for training the dancers as well as selecting and mounting productions. They are almost always a retired dancer. Often they also choreograph some of the company's productions. \n\nIn some companies, the artistic director may also manage the day-to-day operations of the company, but in many (particularly larger) companies, the artistic director is often exempt from routine administrative duties, freeing him or her to concentrate on the art. In those cases, decisions about administration, business issues, finances, fundraising, board relations, donor relations, publicity, and marketing devolve to the responsibility of the general manager, chief operating officer, managing director, etc. or are discussed collaboratively.\n"}

He was a proponent of formalist film theory.\n\nBalázs was the son of German-born parents, adopting his \"nom de plume\" in newspaper articles written before his 1902 move to Budapest, where he studied Hungarian and German at the Eötvös Collegium.\n\nBalázs was a moving force in the Sonntagskreis or Sunday Circle, the intellectual discussion group which he founded in the autumn of 1915 together with Lajos Fülep, Arnold Hauser, György Lukács and Károly (Karl) Mannheim. Meetings were held at his flat on Sunday afternoons; already in December 1915 Balázs wrote in his diary of the success of the group.\n\nHe is perhaps best remembered as the librettist of \"Bluebeard's Castle\" which he originally wrote for his roommate Zoltán Kodály, who in turn introduced him to the eventual composer of the opera, Béla Bartók. This collaboration continued with the scenario for the ballet \"The Wooden Prince\".\n\nThe collapse of the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic under Béla Kun in 1919 began a long period of exile in Vienna and Germany and, from 1933 until 1945, the Soviet Union.\n\nIn Vienna he became a prolific writer of film reviews. His first book on film, \"Der Sichtbare Mensch\" (\"The Visible Man\") (1924), helped found the German \"film as a language\" theory, which also exerted an influence on Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. A popular consultant, he wrote the screenplay for G. W. Pabst's film of \"Die Dreigroschenoper\" (1931), which became the object of a scandal and lawsuit by Brecht (who admitted to not reading the script) during production.\n\nLater, he co-wrote (with Carl Mayer) and helped Leni Riefenstahl direct the film \"Das Blaue Licht\" (1932). Riefenstahl later removed Balázs's and Mayer's names from the credits because they were Jewish. One of his best known films is \"Somewhere in Europe\" (\"It Happened in Europe\", 1947), directed by Géza von Radványi.\n\nHis last years were marked by petty vexations at home and ever increasing recognition in the German-speaking world. In 1949, he received the most distinguished prize in Hungary, the Kossuth Prize. Also in 1949, he finished \"Theory of the Film\", published posthumously in English (London: Denis Dobson, 1952). In 1958, the Béla Balázs Prize was founded and named for him as an award to recognize achievements in cinematography.\n\n\n\n"}

Its name derives from its reputation since ancient times as the place where the playwright Euripides came to write his tragedies. The ancient authors Philochorus and Satyrus described Euripides as a misanthrope who avoided society by lurking in a cave. The second century Roman author Aulus Gellius claimed to have visited the \"grim and gloomy cavern\" during his visit to Athens (Attic Nights XV.20).\n\nIn the 1990s, excavations were carried out under the direction of Yannos G. Lolos, Assistant Professor of Prehistoric Archaeology at the University of Ioannina, Epirus, in collaboration with the Department of Palaeoanthropology of the Greek Ministry of Culture.\n\nFinds date from the late Neolithic onward. They include stone implements and arrowheads; Mycenaean burials; 5th century BC Attic black glaze pottery; Roman period coins and votive figurines; and jewellery from the Frankish period, generally suggesting its long-term use as a place of refuge and worship. The most notable discovery was a fragmentary black-glaze skyphos dating from the late 5th century BC, with the letters ΕΥΡΙΠΠ, clearly part of the name Euripides, carefully inscribed in letters of the Hellenistic or Roman period. Lolos interpreted the cup as a votive offering to Euripides, confirmation of the devotion his poetry inspired in later periods.\n\nLolos also uncovered the foundations of a small rural sanctuary about 70 meters southwest of the cave, on the trail from the shore. Based on a marble phallus and other finds, he interpreted it as a sanctuary of Dionysus, the patron god of Greek theatre.\n\nThe cave, unsignposted, is located between the settlements of Peristeria and Kolones, about 350 meters northwest of the north end of Euripides Street, up a clear footpath. There is a steel door.\n\n"}

The word is derived from the Greek word \"koll\" or \"kolla\", meaning glue, and \"graph\", meaning the activity of drawing.\n\nThe plate can be intaglio-inked, inked with a roller or paintbrush or some combination thereof. Ink or pigment is applied to the resulting collage and the board is used to print onto paper or another material using either a printing press or various hand tools. The resulting print is termed a collagraph. Substances such as carborundum, acrylic texture mediums, sandpapers, textiles, bubble wrap, string or other fibres, cut card, leaves and grass can all be used in creating the collagraph plate. In some instances, leaves can be used as a source of pigment by rubbing them onto the surface of the plate.\n\nDifferent tonal effects and vibrant colours can be achieved with the technique due to the depth of relief and differential inking that results from the collagraph plate's highly textured surface. Collagraphy is a very open printmaking method. Ink may be applied to the upper surfaces of the plate with a brayer for a relief print, or ink may be applied to the entire board and then removed from the upper surfaces but remain in the spaces between objects, resulting in an intaglio print. A combination of both intaglio and relief methods may also be employed. A printing press may or may not be used.\n\n\n"}

Her father was from Rome, Italy and she lived there for a while when she was young. Her Italian family is originally from Praia a Mare in Calabria. When her father died, Patta and her sister inherited a hotel in Rome and holiday apartments in the south of Italy. She considers Italy her second home and travels there regularly.\n\nShe moved to South Africa with her mother, a nurse and devout Catholic, and her sister in 1976 after her parents divorced. She attended Rustenburg School for Girls in the Rondebosch suburb of Cape Town, where she matriculated in 1981.\n\nPatta studied at the University of Cape Town where she obtained a Bachelor of Social Sciences in 1984. She briefly taught aerobics while at university.\n\nAfter graduating from university, Patta worked as a political activist teaching literacy in Cape Town's squatter camps until 1990, when she started working as a freelance reporter for the BBC.\n\nPatta joined Radio 702 in Johannesburg as a reporter in 1990 and worked her way up to news editor in 1994 and special assignments editor in 1997.\n\nThe first news story she worked on that was aired on Radio 702 was about the return of ANC leader Oliver Tambo from exile in December 1990.\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, while working as news and special assignments editor for Radio 702 and its sister station Cape Talk, she investigated and reported on the 1986 plane crash in which Mozambican President Samora Machel was killed. She received several threatening phone calls during the investigation. In June 1998 she participated in a post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission special hearing, providing expert opinion and assisting with questioning regarding the 1987 Helderberg plane crash and the Machel plane crash. She was later interviewed for a 2008 \"Mayday\" (\"Air Crash Investigation\" or \"Air Emergency\") documentary on the Helderberg plane crash.\n\nIn October 2013, Patta returned to Radio 702 as a stand-in talk radio host.\n\nPatta has worked for e.tv, the first privately owned free-to-air television station in South Africa, since its inception in 1998. She started as a senior correspondent in Johannesburg and was subsequently appointed chief anchor of e.tv news.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2013 she was the executive producer and anchor of the weekly current affairs television programme \"3rd Degree\", a show conceptualized by her which focused on hard-hitting interviews. The final episode of \"3rd Degree\" aired on 14 May 2013.\n\nShe has reported on major international stories such as the September 11 attacks and the death of Princess Diana and has interviewed many notable individuals including Shimon Peres, Oprah Winfrey, Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, Jacob Zuma, Cyril Ramaphosa, Julius Malema, Eugène Terre'Blanche and Robert McBride.\n\nShe was appointed editor-in-chief of e.tv news in 2005.

Black members of the public have also accused her of being racist, e.g. after exposing corrupt black doctors who sold medical certificates and after interviewing \"bling queen\" Khanyi Mbau, and Jewish members of the public have accused her of being anti-Semitic after airing the controversial 2002 documentary \"Palestine Is Still the Issue\".\n\nShe has also been criticized as not being qualified to talk about black culture by former ANC Youth League president Julius Malema during an interview with him and by black viewers offended by a \"3rd Degree\" show on black hair weaves.\n\nAWB leader Eugène Terre'Blanche walked out of an interview with Patta after his release from prison in 2004. A complaint lodged against e.tv about the interview was dismissed by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa.\n\nIn 2010 Patta publicly apologized on television to Chrisna de Kock, a Freedom Front Plus youth leader at the University of the Free State, after accusing her of being a racist in an interview on \"3rd Degree\". An e.tv spokesperson conceded that \"the manner in which the allegation was put across was unfortunate\" and the racism comment was subsequently retracted.\n\nPatta has responded to criticism of her reporting with statements such as \"that means I am doing my job well\" and \"we are doing this because we have a true democracy\".\n\nIn April 1995 Patta, a white woman, announced over the radio her plans to marry Mweli Mzizi, a black filmmaker and Zulu prince. The interracial couple had encountered hostility for a year, so she was surprised by the positive response of listeners to her announcement. They were married in January 1996 and the wedding was attended by hundreds of guests including Nelson Mandela. After the wedding the Department of Home Affairs notified Mzizi that the marriage was invalid because he did not fill out a form requiring black men to say that they were not already married. \"Newsweek\" reported that few South Africans were aware of this requirement and \"many of the country's marriages are probably illegal in the eyes of the bureaucracy\".\n\nIn 2000 Patta and Mzizi unsuccessfully attempted to enter a whites-only picnic resort in the Free State together, filming the incident on a hidden camera for a \"3rd Degree\" show on racism following which Patta received hate mail.\n\nIn April 2002 it was reported that Patta and Mzizi were divorcing.\n\nPatta was voted one of the \"FHM 50 Most Eligible Women in the World\" by South African \"FHM\" readers in 2003.\n\nIn June 2003 she married businessman Lance Levitas.\n\nShe has two daughters, one from each marriage.

{"id": "18247304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18247304", "title": "Edward Said", "text": "Edward Said\n\nEdward Wadie Said (; , \"\"; 1 November 1935 – 25 September 2003) was a professor of literature at Columbia University, a public intellectual, and a founder of the academic field of postcolonial studies. A Palestinian American born in Mandatory Palestine, he was a citizen of the United States by way of his father, a U.S. Army veteran.\n\nEducated in the Western canon, at British and American schools, Said applied his education and bi-cultural perspective to illuminating the gaps of cultural and political understanding between the Western world and the Eastern world, especially about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in the Middle East; his principal influences were Antonio Gramsci, Frantz Fanon, Aimé Césaire, Michel Foucault, and Theodor Adorno.\n\nAs a cultural critic, Said is known for the book \"Orientalism\" (1978), a critique of the cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism—how the Western world perceives the Orient. Said's model of textual analysis transformed the academic discourse of researchers in literary theory, literary criticism, and Middle-Eastern studies—how academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied. As a foundational text, \"Orientalism\" was controversial among scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature.\n\nAs a public intellectual, Said was a controversial member of the Palestinian National Council, because he publicly criticized Israel and the Arab countries, especially the political and cultural policies of Muslim régimes who acted against the national interests of their peoples. Said advocated the establishment of a Palestinian state to ensure equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel, including the right of return to the homeland. He defined his oppositional relation with the \"status quo\" as the remit of the public intellectual who has \"to sift, to judge, to criticize, to choose, so that choice and agency return to the individual\" man and woman.\n\nIn 1999, with his friend Daniel Barenboim, Said co-founded the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra, based in Seville, which comprises young Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab musicians. Besides being an academic, Said was also an accomplished pianist, and, with Barenboim, co-authored the book \"Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society\" (2002), a compilation of their conversations about music. Said died of leukemia on 25 September 2003.\n\nEdward Wadie Said was born on 1 November 1935, to Hilda Said and Wadie Said, a businessman in Jerusalem, then part of British-governed Mandatory Palestine (1920–48). Wadie Said was a Palestinian man who soldiered in the U.S. Army component of the American Expeditionary Forces (1917–19), commanded by General John J. Pershing, in the First World War (1914–18). Afterwards, that war-time military service earned American citizenship to Said \"père\" and his family. Edward's mother, Hilda Said was born Lebanese and raised in Nazareth, Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn 1919, in partnership with a cousin, Wadie Said established a stationery business in Cairo. Like her husband, Hilda Said was an Arab Christian, and, although the Said family practiced the Jerusalemite variety of Greek Orthodox Christianity, Edward was agnostic. Moreover, his sister Rosemarie Saïd Zahlan (1937–2006) also pursued an academic career.\n\nSaid lived his boyhood between the worlds of Cairo and Jerusalem; in 1947, he attended St. George's School, Jerusalem, a British school of stern Anglican Christian cast. About being there, Said said:\n\nBy the late 1940s, Edward's schooling included the Egyptian branch of Victoria College, Alexandria (VC), where classmates included (King) Hussein of Jordan, and the Egyptian, Syrian, Jordanian, and Saudi Arabian boys whose academic careers would progress to their becoming ministers, prime ministers, and leading businessmen in their respective countries.\n\nIn that colonial time and place, the function of a British colonial school, such as VC, was to educate selections of young men from the Arab and Levantine ruling classes, to become the Anglicized post-colonial administrators who would rule their countries, upon British decolonization. About Victoria College, Edward said:\n\nIn 1951, Victoria College expelled Edward, who had proved a troublesome boy, despite being a student of great intelligence and much academic achievement; he then attended Northfield Mount Hermon School, Massachusetts, a socially élite, college-prep boarding-school where he lived a difficult year of social alienation. Nonetheless, the student Edward excelled, and achieved the rank of either first (valedictorian) or second (salutatorian) in a class of one hundred sixty students.\n\nIn retrospect, being sent far from the Middle East (Egypt) he viewed as a parental decision much influenced by \"the prospects of deracinated people, like us the Palestinians, being so uncertain that it would be best to send me as far away as possible.\" The realities of peripatetic life—of interwoven cultures, of feeling out of place, and of homesickness—so affected the schoolboy Edward that themes of dissonance feature in the work and worldview of the academic Said. At school's end, he had become Edward W. Said—a polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.\n\nIn 1963, Said joined Columbia University, as a member of the English and Comparative Literature faculties, where he taught and worked until 2003. In 1974, he was Visiting Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard; during the 1975–76 period, he was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science, at Stanford University. In 1977, he became the Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, and subsequently was the Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities; and in 1979 was Visiting Professor of Humanities at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSaid also worked as a visiting professor at Yale University, and lectured at other universities. Said lectured at more than 200 universities in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. In 1992, Said was promoted to \"Professor\", the highest-rank academic job at Columbia University. Editorially, Prof. Edward Said served as president of the Modern Language Association; as editor of the \"Arab Studies Quarterly\" in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; was on the executive board of International PEN; and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Royal Society of Literature, the Council of Foreign Relations the American Philosophical Society. In 1993, Said presented the BBC's annual Reith Lectures, a six-lecture series titled \"Representation of the Intellectual\", wherein he examined the role of the public intellectual in contemporary society, which the BBC published in 2011.\n\nSaid's first published book, \"Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography\" (1966), was an expansion of the doctoral dissertation he presented to earn the PhD degree. Moreover, in \"Edward Saïd: Criticism and Society\" (2010), Abdirahman Hussein said that Conrad's novella \"Heart of Darkness\" (1899) was \"foundational to Said's entire career and project\". Afterwards, Said redacted ideas gleaned from the works of the 17th-century philosopher Giambattista Vico, and other intellectuals, in the book \"Beginnings: Intention and Method\" (1974), about the theoretical bases of literary criticism. Said's later works include \"The World, the Text, and the Critic\" (1983), \"Nationalism, Colonialism, and Literature: Yeats and Decolonization\" (1988), \"Culture and Imperialism\" (1993), \"Representations of the Intellectual: The 1993 Reith Lectures\" (1994), \"Humanism and Democratic Criticism\" (2004), and \"On Late Style\" (2006).\n\nSaid became an established cultural critic with the book \"Orientalism\" (1978) a critique (description and analyses) of Orientalism as the source of the false cultural representations with which the Western world perceives the Middle East—the narratives of how The West sees The East. The thesis of \"Orientalism\" proposes the existence of a \"subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo–Islamic peoples and their culture\", which originates from Western culture's long tradition of false, romanticized images of Asia, in general, and the Middle East, in particular. That such cultural representations have served, and continue to serve, as implicit justifications for the colonial and imperial ambitions of the European powers and of the U.S. Likewise, Said denounced the political and the cultural malpractices of the régimes of the ruling Arab élites who have internalized the false and romanticized representations of Arabic culture that were created by Anglo–American Orientalists.\n\n\"Orientalism\" proposed that much Western study of Islamic civilization was political intellectualism, meant for the self-affirmation of European identity, rather than objective academic study; thus, the academic field of Oriental studies functioned as a practical method of cultural discrimination and imperialist domination—that is to say, the Western Orientalist knows more about the Orient than do the Orientals.\n\nThat the cultural representations of the Eastern world that Orientalism purveys are intellectually suspect, and cannot be accepted as faithful, true, and accurate representations of the peoples and things of the Orient; that the history of European colonial rule and political domination of Asian civilizations, distorts the writing of even the most knowledgeable, well-meaning, and culturally sympathetic Orientalist.\n\nThat since Antiquity, Western Art has misrepresented the Orient with stereotypes; in the tragedy \"The Persians\" (472 BCE), by Aeschylus, the Greek protagonist falls, because he misperceived the true nature of The Orient. That the European political domination of Asia has biased even the most outwardly objective Western texts about The Orient, to a degree unrecognized by the Western scholars who appropriated for themselves the production of cultural knowledge—the academic work of studying, exploring, and interpreting the languages, histories, and peoples of Asia; therefore, Orientalist scholarship implies that the colonial subaltern (the colonised people) were incapable of thinking, acting, or speaking for themselves, thus are incapable of writing their own national histories. In such imperial circumstances, the Orientalist scholars of the West wrote the history of the Orient—and so constructed the modern, cultural identities of Asia—from the perspective that the West is the cultural standard to emulate, the norm from which the \"exotic and inscrutable\" Orientals deviate.\n\nThe thesis of \"Orientalism\" concluded that the West's knowledge of the Orient depicts the cultures of the Eastern world as an irrational, weak, and feminized non–European Other, which is the opposite of the West's representations of Western cultures as a rational, strong, and masculine polity. That such an artificial binary-relation originates from the European psychological need to create a \"difference\" of inequality, between the West and the East, which inequality originates from the immutable cultural essences innate to the peoples of the Oriental world.\n\n\"Orientalism\" provoked much professional and personal criticism for Said among academics. Traditional Orientalists, such as Albert Hourani, Robert Graham Irwin, Nikki Keddie, Bernard Lewis, and Kanan Makiya, suffered negative consequences, because \"Orientalism\" affected public perception of their intellectual integrity and the quality of their Orientalist scholarship. The historian Keddie said that Said's critical work about the field of Orientalism had caused, in their academic disciplines:\n\nIn \"Orientalism\", Said described Bernard Lewis, the Anglo–American Orientalist, as \"a perfect exemplification [of an] Establishment Orientalist [whose work] purports to be objective, liberal scholarship, but is, in reality, very close to being propaganda \"against\" his subject material.\"\n\nLewis responded with a harsh critique of \"Orientalism\" accusing Said of politicizing the scientific study of the Middle East (and Arabic studies in particular); neglecting to critique the scholarly findings of the Orientalists; and giving \"free rein\" to his biases.\n\nSaid retorted that in \"The Muslim Discovery of Europe\" (1982), Lewis responded to his thesis with the claim that the Western quest for knowledge about other societies was unique in its display of disinterested curiosity, which Muslims did not reciprocate towards Europe. Lewis was saying that \"knowledge about Europe [was] the only acceptable criterion for true knowledge.\" The appearance of academic impartiality was part of Lewis's role as an academic authority for zealous \"anti–Islamic, anti–Arab, Zionist, and Cold War crusades.\" Moreover, in the Afterword to the 1995 edition of the book, Said replied to Lewis's criticisms of the first edition of \"Orientalism\" (1978).\n\nIn the academy, \"Orientalism\" became a foundational text of the field of Post-colonial studies, for what the British intellectual Terry Eagleton said is the book's \"central truth ... that demeaning images of the East, and imperialist incursions into its terrain, have historically gone hand in hand.\"\n\nSaid's friends and foes acknowledged the transformative influence of \"Orientalism\" upon scholarship in the humanities; critics said that the thesis is an intellectually limiting influence upon scholars, whilst supporters said that the thesis is intellectually liberating. The fields of post-colonial and cultural studies attempt to explain the \"post-colonial world, its peoples, and their discontents\", for which the techniques of investigation and efficacy in \"Orientalism\", proved especially applicable in Middle Eastern studies.\n\nAs such, the investigation and analysis Said applied in \"Orientalism\" proved especially practical in literary criticism and cultural studies, such as the post-colonial histories of India by Gyan Prakash, Nicholas Dirks and Ronald Inden, modern Cambodia by Simon Springer, and the literary theories of Homi K. Bhabha, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and Hamid Dabashi (\"\", 2007).\n\nIn Eastern Europe, Milica Bakić–Hayden developed the concept of Nesting Orientalisms (1992), derived from the ideas of the historian Larry Wolff (\"Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of the Enlightenment\", 1994) and Said's ideas in \"Orientalism\" (1978). The Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova (\"Imagining the Balkans\", 1997) presented the ethnologic concept of Nesting Balkanisms (\"Ethnologia Balkanica\", 1997), which is derived from Milica Bakić–Hayden's concept of Nesting Orientalisms.\n\nIn \"The Impact of \"Biblical Orientalism\" in Late Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Palestine\" (2014), the historian Lorenzo Kamel, presented the concept of \"Biblical Orientalism\" with an historical analysis of the simplifications of the complex, local Palestinian reality, which occurred from the 1830s until the early 20th century. Kamel said that the selective usage and simplification of religion, in approaching the place known as \"The Holy Land\", created a view that, as a place, the Holy Land has no human history other than as the place where Bible stories occurred, rather than as Palestine, a country inhabited by many peoples.\n\nThe post-colonial discourse presented in \"Orientalism\", also influenced post-colonial theology and post-colonial biblical criticism, by which method the analytical reader approaches a scripture from the perspective of a colonial reader. See: \"The Bible and Zionism: Invented Traditions, Archaeology and Post-colonialism in Palestine–Israel\" (2007). Another book in this area is \"Postcolonial Theory\" (1998), by Leela Gandhi, explains Post-colonialism to how it can be applied to the wider philosophical and intellectual context of history.\n\nIn 1967, consequent to the Six-Day War (5–10 June 1967) the academic Edward Said became a public intellectual when he acted politically to counter the stereotyped misrepresentations (factual, historical, cultural) with which the U.S. news media explained the Arab–Israeli wars; reportage divorced from the historical realities of the Middle East, in general, and Palestine and Israel, in particular. To address, explain, and correct such Orientalism, Said published \"The Arab Portrayed\" (1968), a descriptive essay about images of \"the Arab\" that are meant to evade specific discussion of the historical and cultural realities of the peoples (Jews, Christians, Muslims) who are the Middle East, featured in journalism (print, photograph, television) and some types of scholarship (specialist journals).\n\nIn the essay \"Zionism from the Standpoint of its Victims\" (1979), Said argued in favour of the political legitimacy and philosophic authenticity of the Zionist claims and right to a Jewish homeland; and for the inherent right of national self-determination of the Palestinian people. Said's books about Israel and Palestine include \"The Question of Palestine\" (1979), \"The Politics of Dispossession\" (1994), and \"The End of the Peace Process\" (2000).\n\nFrom 1977 until 1991, Said was an independent member of the Palestinian National Council (PNC). In 1988, he was a proponent of the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1948), and voted for the establishment of the State of Palestine at a meeting of the PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991.\n\nSaid disliked the Oslo Accords for not producing an independent State of Palestine, and because they were politically inferior to a plan that Yasir Arafat had rejected—a plan Said had presented to Arafat on behalf of the U.S. government in the late 1970s. Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.\n\nIn 1995, in response to Said's political criticisms, the Palestinian Authority (PA) banned the sale of Said's books; however, the PA lifted the book-ban when Said publicly praised Yasir Arafat for rejecting Prime Minister Ehud Barak's offers at the Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David (2000) in the U.S.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Said wrote the Foreword to the history book \"\" (1994), by Israel Shahak, about Jewish fundamentalism, which presents the cultural proposition that Israel's mistreatment of the Palestinians is rooted in a Judaic requirement (of permission) for Jews to commit crimes, including murder, against Gentiles (non-Jews). In his Foreword, Said said that \"Jewish History, Jewish Religion\" is \"nothing less than a concise history of classic and modern Judaism, insofar as these are relevant to the understanding of modern Israel\"; and praised the historian Shahak for describing contemporary Israel as a nation subsumed in a \"Judeo–Nazi\" cultural ambiance that allowed the dehumanization of the Palestinian Other:\n\nIn 1998, Said made \"In Search of Palestine\" (1998), a BBC documentary film about Palestine past and present. In the company of his son, Wadie, Said revisited the places of his boyhood, and confronted injustices meted out to ordinary Palestinians in the contemporary West Bank. Despite the social and cultural prestige usual to BBC cinema products in the U.S., the documentary was never broadcast by any American television company. In 1999, the American monthly \"Commentary\" cited ledgers kept at the Land Registry Office in Jerusalem during the Mandatory period as background for his boyhood recollections.\n\nOn 3 July 2000, whilst touring the Middle East with his son, Wadie, Edward Said was photographed throwing a stone across the Blue Line Lebanese–Israel border, which image elicited much political criticism about his action demonstrating an inherent, personal sympathy with terrorism; and, in \"Commentary\" magazine, the journalist Edward Alexander labelled Said as \"The Professor of Terror\", for aggression against Israel. Said explained the stone-throwing as a two-fold action, personal and political; a man-to-man contest-of-skill, between a father and his son, and an Arab Man's gesture of joy at the end of the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon (1985–2000):\n\nDespite having denied that he aimed the stone at an Israeli guardhouse, the Beirut newspaper \"As-Safir\" (The Ambassador) reported that a Lebanese local resident reported that Prof. Said was at less than ten metres (ca. 30 ft.) distance from the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) soldiers manning the two-storey guardhouse, when Said aimed and threw the stone over the border fence; the stone's projectile path was thwarted when it struck the barbed wire atop the border fence. Nonetheless, in the U.S., despite a political fracas by right-wing students at Columbia University and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith International (Sons of the Covenant), the university provost published a five-page letter defending Prof. Said's action as an academic's freedom of expression:\n\nNevertheless, Said endured political repercussions, such as the cancellation of an invitation to give a lecture to the Freud Society, in Austria, in February 2001. The President of the Freud Society justified withdrawing the invitation by explaining to Said that \"the political situation in the Middle East, and its consequences\" had rendered an accusation of anti-Semitism a very serious matter, and that any such accusation \"has become more dangerous\" in the politics of Austria; thus, the Freud Society cancelled their invitation to Said in order to \"avoid an internal clash\" of opinions, about him, that might ideologically divide the Freud Society. In \"Culture and Resistance: Conversations with Edward Saïd\" (2003), Said likened his political situation to the situation that Noam Chomsky has perdured as a public intellectual:\n\nIn the revised edition of \"Covering Islam: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World\" (1997), Said criticized the Orientalist bias of the Western news media's reportage about the Middle East and Islam, especially the tendency to editorialize \"speculations about the latest conspiracy to blow up buildings, sabotage commercial airliners, and poison water supplies.\" He criticized the American military involvement in the Kosovo War (1998–99) as an imperial action; and described the Iraq Liberation Act (1998), promulgated during the Clinton Administration, as the political license that predisposed the U.S. to invade Iraq in 2003, which was authorised with the Iraq Resolution (2 October 2002); and the continual support of Israel by successive U.S. presidential governments, as actions meant to perpetuate regional political instability in the Middle East.\n\nIn the event, despite being sick with leukemia, as a public intellectual, Said continued criticising the U.S. Invasion of Iraq in mid-2003; and, in the Egyptian \"Al-Ahram Weekly\" newspaper, in the article \"Resources of Hope\" (2 April 2003), Said said that the U.S. war against Iraq was a politically ill-conceived military enterprise:\n\nIn 2003, Haidar Abdel-Shafi, Ibrahim Dakak, Mustafa Barghouti, and Said established \"Al-Mubadara\" (The Palestinian National Initiative), headed by Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, a third-party reformist, democratic party meant to be an alternative to the usual two-party politics of Palestine. As a political party, the ideology of \"Al-Mubadara\" is specifically an alternative to the extremist politics of the social-democratic Fatah and the Islamist Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement). Said's founding of the group, as well as his other international political activities concerning Palestine, were noticed by the U.S. government; in 2006, the anthropologist David Price obtained 147 pages of the 283-page political dossier that the FBI had compiled on Said, begun in 1971, four years into his career as a public intellectual active in U.S. politics.\n\nBesides having been a public intellectual, Edward Said was an accomplished pianist, worked as the music critic for \"The Nation\" magazine, and wrote four books about music: \"Musical Elaborations\" (1991); \"Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society\" (2002), with Daniel Barenboim as co-author; \"On Late Style: Music and Literature Against the Grain\" (2006); and \"Music at the Limits\" (2007) in which final tome he spoke of finding musical reflections of his literary and historical ideas in bold compositions and strong performances.\n\nElsewhere in the musical world, the composer Mohammed Fairouz acknowledged the deep influence of Edward Said upon his works; compositionally, Fairouz's \"First Symphony\" thematically alludes to the essay \"Homage to a Belly-Dancer\" (1990), about Tahia Carioca, the Egyptian terpsichorean, actress, and political militant; and a piano sonata titled \"Reflections on Exile\" (1984), which thematically refers to the emotions inherent to being an exile.\n\nIn 1999, Edward W. Said and Daniel Barenboim co-founded the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, which is composed of young Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab musicians. They also established The Barenboim–Said Foundation in Seville, to develop education-through-music projects. Besides managing the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra, the Barenboim–Said Foundation assists with the administration of the Academy of Orchestral Studies, the Musical Education in Palestine Project, and the Early Childhood Musical Education Project, in Seville.\n\nBesides honors, memberships, and postings to prestigious organizations worldwide, Edward Said was awarded some twenty honorary university degrees in the course of his professional life as an academic, critic, and Man of Letters. Among the honors bestowed to him was the Bowdoin Prize by Harvard University. He twice received the Lionel Trilling Book Award; the first occasion was the inaugural bestowing of said literary award in 1976, for \"Beginnings: Intention and Method\" (1974). He also received the Wellek Prize of the American Comparative Literature Association, and was awarded the inaugural Spinoza Lens Prize. In 2001, Said was awarded the Lannan Literary Award for Lifetime Achievement, and in 2002, he received the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord. He was the first U.S. citizen to receive the Sultan Owais Prize (for Cultural & Scientific Achievements, 1996–1997). The autobiography \"Out of Place\" (1999) was bestowed three awards, the 1999 New Yorker Book Award for Non-Fiction; the 2000 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Non-Fiction; and the Morton Dauwen Zabel Award in Literature.\n\nOn 25 September 2003, after enduring a twelve-year sickness with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Edward W. Said died, at 67 years of age, in New York City. He was survived by his wife, Mariam C. Said, his son, Wadie Said, and his daughter, Najla Said. The eulogists included Alexander Cockburn (\"A Mighty and Passionate Heart\"); Seamus Deane (\"A Late Style of Humanism\"); Christopher Hitchens (\"A Valediction for Edward Said\"); Tony Judt (\"The Rootless Cosmopolitan\"); Michael Wood (\"On Edward Said\"); and Tariq Ali (\"Remembering Edward Said, 1935–2003\"). In November 2004, in Palestine, Birzeit University renamed their music school the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music.\n\nThe tributes to Edward Said include books and schools; such as \"Waiting for the Barbarians: A Tribute to Edward W. Said\" (2008) features essays by Akeel Bilgrami, Rashid Khalidi, and Elias Khoury; \"Edward Said: The Charisma of Criticism\" (2010), by Harold Aram Veeser, a critical biography; and \"Edward Said: A Legacy of Emancipation and Representations\" (2010), essays by Joseph Massad, Ilan Pappé, Ella Shohat, Ghada Karmi, Noam Chomsky, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and Daniel Barenboim; and the Barenboim–Said Academy (Berlin) was established in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n"}

For the next 3 years, German troops used Jewish slave laborers from Mniszek and the nearby city of Rachów to build roads and bridges for their Eastern campaign. Once the Nazis moved to implement the \"Final Solution\", however, the Jews of Rachów and Mniszek—those who had not already been murdered—were instructed to leave their homes and report to the train station in Kraśnik, about 20 miles away. No one knew where they were going. Many thought they were going to be taken to a ghetto somewhere. Others whispered darkly of death camps.\n\nEsther was by then 15, the second in a family of 5 children and the oldest girl. Her family had managed to struggle through the German occupation, watching their already-meager livelihood dwindle to nearly nothing. Her father, a horse trader, could no longer travel. Soldiers had taken the last of her mother's geese just as her eggs were about to hatch. The night before their departure, as her family assembled what few belongings remained to them, Esther decided she would not go with them. She turned to her mother for help, insisting that one of the Polish farmers among her father's friends would take her in and give her work. Although at first reluctant to let her go, Esther's mother agreed to give her some provisions and destinations.\n\nAs the family said their goodbyes to her, Esther realized she could not carry out her plan by herself and insisted that her 13-year-old sister, Mania, go with her. Mania was reluctant, wanting only to stay with the rest of the family, but Esther was emphatic. On October 15, 1942, her father, Hersh; her mother, Rachel; her older brother, Ruven; and her little sisters, Chana and Leah, set off on the road to Kraśnik. It was the last time Esther saw her family.\n\nMania was heartbroken and cried to go back to their family. Giving in, Esther turned back with her to the Kraśnik road, filled by now with a stream of refugees. Esther and Mania joined them, walking with their cousin Dina and her baby past fields and through the sandhills of the valley. As they walked on, Esther realized that the next bend in the road would lead to the train station, and she halted in panic, insisting that she could not continue. At this, their cousin turned to Mania and told her she should leave the road and go with her sister.\n\nEsther and Mania went first to the house of Stefan, a good man who embraced them when they arrived. But after sheltering them for a couple of days, Stefan told them that the rest of the village knew where they were and that the Gestapo would soon come looking for them. In tears, he put them out of his house.\n\nKnowing now that it was not safe for them to be seen, Esther and Mania waited in the forest until the rain ended and their clothes dried. While they waited, Esther devised a plan: They would make their way to another village where they were not known. There, they would say that they had come from the northern part of Poland, where their family, like others in the region, had lost its farm to a German family. With their digging tools in sacks across their shoulders, they would ask for work in harvesting potatoes.\n\nThey eventually came to the village of Grabówka. Pretending to be a Polish Catholic girl named Josephina, Esther found work with an old farmer whose wife was ill and bedridden. Mania also became a housekeeper, for the village's sheriff and his mother. Until 1944, Esther and Mania cooked, cleaned, cared for animals, helped in the fields, went to church, and lived out the daily lives of two Polish farm girls.\n\nAlthough the Germans did not have a camp in the village, the Gestapo were stationed nearby and soldiers came and went in the village frequently, commandeering food and other supplies as they needed them. They also took young people for labor camps, now that the Jews had been eliminated. So even though she was assumed to be Polish, Esther was still forced to run up to the attic of the barn to hide when the Germans were seen to be in the village.\n\nIn May 1944, after both the farmer and his wife had died and Esther was living on the farm by herself, an old soldier in Grabówka, a veteran of the First World War, told his neighbors that he could hear artillery fire in the distance to the east. The Russians were pushing the Germans back across Poland, and the old soldier predicted that the front would be in their village within a few days. Under his direction, the neighbors dug out a bunker and prepared to go below. The battle front arrived as predicted, and the neighbors spent a night in the bunker as the German and Russian artillery engaged on the ground immediately above them.\n\nThat day, at sunset, a platoon of Soviet soldiers arrived in Grabówka. Esther and her neighbors ran to greet them. After waiting 2 weeks, Esther left for Mniszek to see who else had returned. When she arrived in Mniszek, her former neighbors were shocked to see her. Only a few other Jews had come back. All the rest were rumored to have been taken to a death camp nearby called Majdanek. Unable to find the rest of her family, Esther decided to join the Polish Army, then continuing on its way west to Warsaw under Marshal Zhukov's command.\n\nBefore she left, Esther set out to see Majdanek for herself. The Polish Army had taken over the camp, and soldiers who had been there for a while served as guides, taking new recruits around to point out the horrors inflicted by the Nazis. Esther noticed the enormous cabbages growing in the fields around the crematorium, later learning that it had been the dumping site for ashes.\n\nWith Marshal Zhukov's army, Esther eventually arrived in Germany.\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, Esther returned to Grabówka to get Mania and in 1946, the two of them returned to Germany, making their way to a Displaced Persons camp in the favored American Zone, in the city of Ziegenheim. She met Max Krinitz there and, in November 1946, married him in a ceremony conducted in the camp. The following year, pregnant with their first child, Esther joined Max in Belgium, where he had gone to work in the coal mines. While in Belgium, he contacted a cousin who lived in the United States and she agreed to arrange for sponsorship of his immigration. In June 1949, Esther, Max and their daughter arrived in New York.\n\nIn June 1999, exactly 50 years after she left Europe, Esther returned to Mniszek to see what remained. The landscape of central Poland had not changed: farmers driving horse-drawn wooden wagons, red and yellow fields of poppy and mustard, women carrying baskets overflowing with ripe strawberries. Both in Mniszek and Grabówka, Esther met again with friends and neighbors from her childhood. \"Yes, it was just like that!\" they said when she showed them photographs of her art.\n\nImmediately following her return from Poland, Esther became seriously ill; she died in 2001 at the age of 74.\n\nEsther Nisenthal Krinitz began her series of fabric pictures in 1977, with a depiction of her home and family in Mniszek. Although trained as a dressmaker and highly skilled in needlework, Esther had no training in art and no conception of herself as an artist. Yet her first picture was so well received by her family and friends and was so personally satisfying that Esther went on to do another, also of her childhood home.\n\nThe next subjects for her art were two dreams she had had while hiding in Grabówka. Each dream—one in which her grandfather had appeared to her and another in which her mother came for her—had left singular vivid images in Esther's memory, and translating them into pictures was an important accomplishment for her. Once the dream sequence was completed, Esther decided to begin a narrative series that grew increasingly complex. With the addition of text, her art became illustrations of Esther's story of survival.\n\nArt and Remembrance is traveling an exhibit of Esther Nisenthal Krinitz's to museums in the United States, and in the future hopes to bring the art to Poland, Israel and other countries that share the legacy of the Holocaust. The entire collection began its public exhibitions at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland and has subsequently been exhibited at more than a dozen museums in the US . In 2012, it returned to the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, where it will stay until September 1, 2013. Future exhibits include the Florida Holocaust Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida and the Evansville Museum of Art and Science in Evansville, Indiana.\n\nIn 2011, Art and Remembrance completed the 30-minute documentary film, \"Through the Eye of the Needle: The Art of Esther Nisenthal Krinitz.\" The film tells the story of her harrowing experiences surviving the Holocaust in Poland and how she came to create an amazing and beautiful narrative in embroidery and fabric collage through images of Esther’s artwork, and the story in her own voice, as well as interviews with family members and others.\n\n\"Trained as a dressmaker but with no training in art, Esther picked up a needle and thread, intending simply to show her children all that she had gone through. Yet the art she created -- both beautiful and shocking -- is universal in its appeal, expressing deep love of family and personal courage in the face of terror and loss,\" says the Smithsonian.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1105355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1105355", "title": "I and Thou", "text": "I and Thou\n\nIch und Du, usually translated as I and Thou(You), is a book by Martin Buber, published in 1923, and first translated from German to English in 1937.\n\nBuber's main proposition is that we may address existence in two ways:\nOne of the major themes of the book is that human life finds its meaningfulness in relationships. In Buber's view, all of our relationships bring us ultimately into relationship with God, who is the Eternal Thou.\n\nBuber explains that humans are defined by two word pairs: \"I-It\" and \"I-Thou\".\n\nThe \"It\" of \"I-It\" refers to the world of experience and sensation. \"I-It\" describes entities as discrete objects drawn from a defined set (e.g., he, she or any other objective entity defined by what makes it measurably different from other entities). It can be said that \"I\" have as many distinct and different relationships with each \"It\" as there are \"Its\" in one's life. Fundamentally, \"It\" refers to the world as we experience it.\n\nBy contrast, the word pair \"I-Thou\" describes the world of relations. This is the \"I\" that does not objectify any \"It\" but rather acknowledges a living relationship. \"I-Thou\" relationships are sustained in the spirit and mind of an \"I\" for however long the feeling or idea of relationship is the dominant mode of perception. A person sitting next to a complete stranger on a park bench may enter into an \"I-Thou\" relationship with the stranger merely by beginning to think positively about people in general. The stranger is a person as well, and gets instantaneously drawn into a mental or spiritual relationship with the person whose positive thoughts necessarily include the stranger as a member of the set of persons about whom positive thoughts are directed. It is not necessary for the stranger to have any idea that he is being drawn into an \"I-Thou\" relationship for such a relationship to arise. But what is crucial to understand is the word pair \"I-Thou\" can refer to a relationship with a tree, the sky, or the park bench itself as much as it can refer to the relationship between two individuals. The essential character of \"I-Thou\" is the abandonment of the world of sensation, the melting of the between, so that the relationship with another \"I\" is foremost.\n\nBuber's two notions of \"I\" require attachment of the word \"I\" to a word partner. The splitting into the individual terms \"I\" and \"it\" and \"thou\" is only for the purposes of analysis. Despite the separation of \"I\" from the \"It\" and \"Thou\" in this very sentence describing the relationship, there is to Buber's mind either an \"I-Thou\" or an \"I-It\" relationship. Every sentence that a person uses with \"I\" refers to the two pairs: \"I-Thou\" and \"I-It\", and likewise \"I\" is implicit in every sentence with \"Thou\" or \"It\". Each It is bounded by others and It can only exist through this attachment because for every object there is another object. Thou, on the other hand, has no limitations. When \"Thou\" is spoken, the speaker has no thing (has nothing), hence, Thou is abstract; yet the speaker “takes his stand in relation”.\n\nWhat does it mean to experience the world? One goes around the world extracting knowledge from the world in experiences betokened by \"He\", \"She\", and \"It\". One also has \"I-Thou\" relationships. Experience is all physical, but these relationships involve a great deal of spirituality. The twofold nature of the world means that our being in the world has two aspects: the aspect of experience, which is perceived as I-It, and the aspect of relation, which is perceived as I-Thou.\n\nBuber uses an example of a tree and presents five separate relations:\nThrough all of these relations, the tree is still an object that occupies time and space and still has the characteristics that make it what it is.\n\nIf \"Thou\" is used in the context of an encounter with a human being, the human being is not He, She, or bound by anything. You do not \"experience\" the human being; rather you can only relate to him or her in the sacredness of the I-Thou relation. The I-Thou relationship cannot be explained; it simply is. Nothing can intervene in the I-Thou relationship. I-Thou is not a means to some object or goal, but a definitive relationship involving the whole being of each subject.\n\nLike the I-Thou relation, love is a subject-to-subject relationship. Love is not a relation of subject to object, but rather a relation in which both members in the relationship are subjects and share the unity of being.\n\nThe ultimate Thou is God. In the I-Thou relation there are no barriers. This enables us to relate directly to God. God is ever-present in human consciousness, manifesting in music, literature, and other forms of culture. Inevitably, Thou is addressed as It, and the I-Thou relation becomes the being of the I-Thou relation. God is now spoken to directly, not spoken about.\n\nThere is no world that disconnects one from God, a world of It alone, when I-Thou guides one’s actions. \"One who truly meets the world goes out also to God.\" God is the worldwide relation to all relations.\n\n\n\n"}

Each edition consists of architectural competitions and a range of accompanying events like exhibitions, presentations and lectures. Over time it has shifted from being a biennial to being held in irregular years\n\nThe first edition of Biennale of Architecture in Kraków was organised in 1985 by a group of Polish architects gathered in The Association of Polish Architects ( - SARP) on the initiative of Romuald Loegler. The Biennale grew in importance following the democratic transition in Poland in 1989. In the 1990s Biennale became a unique forum for exchanging ideas and individual experience among the architects from all over the world. In 1994, the Biennale celebrated the astronomer, Copernicus.\n\nDuring different editions of the event, projects in competitions were evaluated by Wojciech Leśnikowski, Pekka Salminen, Julia Bolles and Peter Wilson, Francesco Purini, Eckhard Feddersen, Günter Schlusche, Hildebrand Machleidt, Armando dal Fabbro, Peter Cook, Roger Hopkinson and many others. Invitged guests have included Frei Otto, Jacques Herzog, Pierre de Meuron, Zvi Hecker, David Mackay, Dietmar Eberle.\n\nEconomic and organisational constraints eventually made it impossible to go on with the original Biennale formula, although the name Biennale was retained.\n\nIn 2015, the Biennale celebrated its jubilee year, exploring the theme of \"the human dimension of urban spaces.\" Its most recent event was in 2017.\n"}

In that role she was responsible for BBC Worldwide's television channels, which operate in more than 100 countries, and the development and roll out of the commercial global iPlayer. She was also Worldwide's Managing Director for Latin America with oversight of the company's businesses in the region. She sat on Worldwide's Executive Board and on the Board of UKTV, Britain's second largest pay-TV group. She took up this role in February 2011 moving from the BBC's UK public service where she had been Director of Vision at the BBC from 2006. As Director of BBC Vision, she headed \"the largest multi-media production, commissioning and broadcast group of its kind in the world\" with overall responsibility for BBC Television and its online services, BBC Films and BBC Productions. Previously she was Director of Television (appointed January 2002). In her two most recent roles at the BBC, Jana Bennett \"steered the BBC TV portfolio through its transition into the mainstream digital age.\"\n\nShe was previously Executive Vice President and General Manager at Discovery Communications in the US.\n\nBennett is a member of the governing board of the Pew Research Center. She is also a Governor of the Royal Shakespeare Company and was made a Fellow of the Royal Television Society in 1999.\n\nBorn in Cooperstown, New York State, USA, Bennett moved to Britain in 1969, where she was educated at Bognor Regis Comprehensive School, then studied politics, philosophy and economics at St Anne's College, Oxford. She undertook post-graduate studies at the London School of Economics where she was awarded an MSc (Dist) for her work on strategic analysis and international and defence studies.\n\nIn 1979 she won a place on the BBC News trainee scheme, and began her first period of employment with the corporation working on radio and television news; BBC Newcastle's \"Look North\" and Radio Sheffield. She worked on \"Nationwide\", \"The Money Programme\" and \"Newsnight\".\n\nShe became an award-winning producer of Panorama in 1986, and co-authored \"The Disappeared: Voices from a Secret War\" with the BBC's diplomatic editor John Simpson about the actions of Argentina's military government in the same year.\n\nIn 1990 she became editor of the BBC's flagship science programme \"Horizon\". Awards she won during this period included the 1991 News and Documentary Emmy for her role as Executive Producer of the film \"Suicide Mission to Chernobyl\" which also aired on the WGBH program \"Nova\" in the United States.\n\nIn 1994 she was appointed the BBC's Head of Science, the first woman to take that role. Under her leadership the department expanded the range and ambition of its programming, winning awards for series such as \"Walking With Dinosaurs\", \"The Human Body\" and \"Meet The Ancestors\" and business formats such as \"Blood on the Carpet\", \"Back to the Floor\" and the medical format \"Trust Me, I'm a Doctor\". She introduced a new animal genre to UK television with the highly successful and long-running \"Animal Hospital\", alongside live events such as \"Hospitalwatch\".

She introduced a new editorial direction under the slogan \"Life Unscripted\" which included reality-drama and interior design shows, some of them based on popular British formats. The audience success of shows like \"Trading Spaces\", and \"Junkyard Wars\" exemplified a shift in programming towards more mass-appeal shows. By 2001 TLC had the youngest adult audience profile amongst US cable channels with a median age of 40 and a 15% year on year growth in audience among the 18- to 34-year-old age group.

{"id": "49672458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49672458", "title": "Jovan Došenović", "text": "Jovan Došenović\n\nJovan Atanasijev Došenović (Serbian Cyrillic: Јован Атанасијев Дошеновић, Hungarian: Dosenovics János Atanáz; October 20, 1781 — 1813) was a Serbian philosopher, poet and translator, one of the first Serbian literary aestheticians.\n\nJovan is son of protoiereus Atanasije Došenović. He was born in Počitelj in Lika or Velika Pisanica. He studied at the University of Padua, where he got his Doctor of Philosophy and other academic degrees. He has lived for a while in his father’s home after returning to Lika, and then worked as a bookkeeper in Trieste, in a big shop owned by Dositej Obradović’s friend Draga Teodorović. He remained there until 1809, when he went to Pešta to publish his writings. \"Recommend, brother,\" Draga told him at their farewell, \"let them write and work, there is a world in front of [everyone’s] eyes.\" \"And as long as we have money,\" Došenović replied happily. In Pešta he printed his anthology of poems; it was \"Čislenica\" or \"Nauka računa\" (lit. \"Science of Mathematics\"), Part I, and he was preparing to publish more to the world. There he got sick, but quickly recovered. After this event, trail on Jovan is lost. However, it is known that in 1811 Došenović was still alive; in 1815 he has been mentioned among deceased Serbian writers. Besides Italian language in which he studied, he was able to speak French and German languages. After finding some information on his work, Jernej Kopitar used to put Došenović’s humble beginnings among best products of Serbian literature of that time, and in literary discussions (via letters sent to friends) he mentioned Došenović’s name several times.\n\nJovan Došenović’s poems can be divided by origin, subject and form. In the first case, he used to translate more than to write on his own. His literary-historical significance is that he appears as the first person who was familiar with someone else’s art and poetry, and is the first person who started translating poems from other languages. Only this way Serbian readers of that time could get familiar with a variety of poetic forms, seeing that except natural poetry (which was common in renewed Serbian literature) there were other artistic poetry forms, and that in fact this was the most important of all. Došenović cited sources for his translated poems in the prefaces of his books, where he mentions Italians Iacopo Vittorelli (1749-1835) and Giovanni Battista Casti, and Russian Mikhail Lomonosov. It was not vanity dictating him not to tell for source for every single poem separately. He did not relied on this. Main ideal he was guided by was: is it possible to have different songs in Serbian language too? That possibility he believed was completely true, so he tried to make everyone else see his printing. While translating his ideals, he did not want to show them to the Serbian publicity. In them he was trying to find only support column, choosing what he thinks is important for Serbian poetry literature by form and/or content. Subject he used to write about was love or depicting of natural beauties; by form they were anacreontics, sonnets and odes. In every Došenović’s verse it can be seen how hands of poets are being tied and freedom of movement for a used language being cut. He wanted to write poems in popular language spoken by an ordinary man; generally, he actually did write only in vernacular language. In order to reach a total clearance, he needed to do so much more so that could be achieved successfully. Orthography was another factor that influenced him as his language was not \"clear\"; however, he strived to make it that way everywhere...\n\nBeginnings of some more specific lyricism in modern Serbian literature is directly related to the poetic work of Došenović. He was the first one to come out with new forms of already mentioned anacreontics, sonnet and even more free odes; he was first to begin translating other eminent poets; he was first to show greater freedom and agility in poetic terms, too. All he did was using the famous collection with the preface of the Serbian literature in large-scale, speaking of aesthetics literature. Thus, the Došenović is one of the first Serbian literary aestheticians.\n\nDošenović did not want to surrender to the way of writing poems in that time; he knew what had to be different; he saw that in other peoples, especially Italians; he wanted to make a Serbian poem really an ode poem; due to the latter, he gets into fights with anything that was slowing down artistic poetry: using form, language and orthography, and making some successes.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5343824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5343824", "title": "Libri Carolini", "text": "Libri Carolini\n\nThe Libri Carolini (\"Charles' books\"), Opus Caroli regis contra synodum (\"The work of King Charles against the Synod\"), also called Charlemagne's Books or simply the Carolines, are the work in four books composed on the command of Charlemagne, around 790, to refute the supposed conclusions of the Byzantine Second Council of Nicaea (787), particularly as regards its acts and decrees in the matter of sacred images. They are \"much the fullest statement of the Western attitude to representational art that has been left to us by the Middle Ages\". The work appears to have been very largely a polemic based on a misunderstanding of the actual position taken by the Byzantine church, which was quietly archived when this was realized, probably in Rome. \n\nThe \"Libri Carolini\" were never promulgated at the time apart from being sent to Pope Adrian I who responded with a \"grandis et verbosa epistola\" (dignified and wordy letter), and remained all but unknown until they were first printed in 1549, by Jean du Tillet, Bishop of Meaux, under the name of \"Eriphele\". They contain 120 objections against the Second Council of Nicaea, and are couched in harsh, reproachful terms, including the following: \"dementiam\" (\"folly\"), \"priscae Gentilitatis obsoletum errorem\" (\"an old and outmoded pagan misunderstanding\"), \"argumenta insanissima et absurdissima\" (\"most insane and absurd reasoning\"), \"derisione dignas naenias\" (\"screeds worthy of derision\"), etc. The modern edition of this text, by Ann Freeman and Paul Meyvaert (Hannover 1998), is called \"Opus Caroli regis contra synodum\" (\"The work of King Charles against the Synod\"), and is based on the manuscript in the Vatican Library, which is now generally accepted as a Carolingian working manuscript \"hastily finished up\", when it became clear that the work was now redundant.\n\nWhen the work resurfaced during the Protestant Reformation, it caused a good deal of excitement and confusion. Despite its support of images, John Calvin refers to it approvingly in later editions of his \"Institutes of the Christian Religion\" (Book 1, Ch 11, section 14), and uses it in his argument against the veneration of images.\n\nThe work begins, \"In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ beginneth the work of the most illustrious and glorious man Charles, by the will of God, king of the Franks, Gauls, Germany, Italy, neighboring provinces, with the assistance of the king, against the Synod which in Greek parts firmly and proudly decreed in favour of adoring (\"adorandis\") images recklessly and arrogantly,\" followed immediately by what is called \"Charlemagne's Preface\". However, it is unlikely that Charlemagne wrote any of the books himself, although the views expressed were influenced by him. He apparently did not accept that art had any advantages over books, a view not held by many of his advisers.\n\nThe preferred candidate as author of most modern scholars, following Anne Freeman, is Bishop Theodulf of Orleans, a Spanish Visigoth in origin, of which traces can be detected in the Latin and the liturgical references in the work. The Vatican manuscript has an author, considered to be Theodulf, and a corrector. It is very likely that several clerics at the court contributed to discussions formulating a work to be issued in the Emperor's name, but it seems likely that Theodulf composed the text we have.\n\nIn the past, some have attributed the writings to Angilram, Bishop of Metz or others of the bishops of France, alleging that Pope Adrian having sent Charlemagne the Acts of the Council in 790, he gave them to the French bishops for examination, and that the \"Libri Carolini\" was the answer they returned. There is also evidence that the author was Alcuin; besides the English tradition that he had written such a book, there is also the remarkable similarity of his commentary on St. John (4, 5, et seqq.) to a passage in \"Liber IV.\", cap. vi., of the \"Libri Carolini\".\n\nAccording to the \"Libri Carolini\", images may be used as ecclesiastical ornaments, for purposes of instruction, and in memory of past events. It is foolish, however, to burn incense before them and to use lights, though it is quite wrong to cast them out of the churches and destroy them. Strong opposition is voiced to \"adoration\" of images, wrongly believing that the Second Council of Nicaea used this word, taken to mean the absolute adoration reserved for God alone, while only appropriate veneration is to be given to the saints and reverential honour to the Cross of Christ, Scripture, sacred vessels, and relics of the saints. The Greek word προσκύνησις that the Council in fact used means no more than reverence in a prostrate attitude.\n\nThe \"Libri Carolini\" also blame the excessive reverence shown by the Greeks to their emperors, criticize unfavourably the elevation of Tarasius to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and find fault with the Scriptural and patristic exegesis of the Greeks. They confuse statements of the Second Council of Nicaea with those of the Iconoclastic conciliabulum of 754, frequently misrepresent the facts, and in general exhibit a strong anti-Greek bias.\n\nVarious iconodule arguments for the use of images are dismissed. The reverence shown to the Ark of the Covenant in the Hebrew Bible is not accepted as an analogy for the attitude due to art, as the Ark was made on the direct instructions and to the designs of God himself. That Theodulf's oratory has a mosaic on this very subject, otherwise unknown at this scale, is itself taken as an argument for his authorship of the work.\n\nThe contents were interpreted by Calvin and other iconoclast writers during the Protestant Reformation as support for their attitude. They were also put on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, where they remained until 1900, either because of their iconoclastic arguments or because seen as interference by a civil authority in matters of Church doctrine.\n\nAccording to the Catholic Encyclopedia the editions of the \"Libri Carolini\" that have been in print are not those that were sent to Pope Adrian by Charlemagne, to which the Pope designed to write a refutation. This has been shown by Hefele, who notes that those sent to the Pope treated the matter in an entirely different order; and that they contained only 85 chapters, while the printed books have 120, or 121 if the authenticity of the last chapter is granted. Moreover, the quotations made in Adrian's reply do not occur verbatim in the \"Libri Carolini\", but are in some cases lengthened, in others abbreviated.\n\nPetavius thinks that what Adrian received were extracts from the \"Libri Carolini\", made by the Council of Frankfort (794). Hefele arrives at a directly opposite conclusion, \"viz.\", that the \"Libri Carolini\" are an expansion of the Capitula sent to the Pope, and that this expansion was made at the bidding of Charlemagne. Baronius, Bellarmine, Binius, and Surius all questioned the authenticity of the \"Libri Carolini\" altogether. However, this extreme position seems to be refuted by the fact that certain quotations made by Hincmar are found in the modern printed books, and may have been influenced by their use by Protestant writers during the Reformation. It is now generally accepted that the books are authentic, and the original Carolingian manuscript, as published by Freeman, was rediscovered in the 20th century.\n\nThe work was refuting a bad copy of a very incompetent translation of the Byzantine decrees. In particular it seems clear that at least one negative was omitted, reversing the sense of the Greek, and that the Greek word proskynesis was mistranslated as \"adoration\", for which the Greek word is \"latria\", which the Council had stated, in the invariable position shared by Catholics and Orthodox, was due only to the persons of the Trinity.\n\nIt seems that the authors of these books had never read the acts nor decrees of the Second Council of Nicaea, or only in a very poor translation. Further, they seemed ignorant of what took place at the Second Council of Constantinople in 754. As an example, in Book IV., Chapter xiv., and also in Chapter xx., (Migne's ed., col. 1213 and col. 1226), the charge is made that the Second Council of Nicaea, specifically Gregory, the bishop of Neocaesarea, unduly flattered the Empress. However, these remarks were made at the Conciliabulum of 754, and not at the Second Council of Nicaea; also, they were not made by Gregory of Neocaesarea at all, and the reason they are attributed to him is because he read them in the proceedings of that pseudo-council to the true council of 787.\n\nThe most famous example of incongruity in these books occurs in Book III., Chapter xvii., in which it is attributed to Constantius, the bishop of Cyprus, the statement that the sacred images were to be given supreme adoration due to the Holy Trinity. Sir William Palmer, and most modern scholars, attribute all of these mistakes to the books' authors using a mistranslated version of the acts and decrees of the Second Council of Nicaea. Of this translation, Anastasius Bibliothetius says, \"The translator both misunderstood the genius of the Greek language as well as that of the Latin, and has merely translated word for word; and in such a fashion that it is scarcely ever possible to know (aut vix aut nunquam) what it means; moreover nobody ever reads this translation and no copies of it are made.\"\n\nFollowing are select false statements made in the text:\n\n\nFreeman, Ann, with Paul Meyvaert. \"Opus Caroli regis contra synodum (Libri Carolini)\", Hannover 1998 (=Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Concilia, Bd. 2, Supplementum I).\n\nPartial English translation: Caecilia Davis-Weyer, ed. \"Early Medieval Art 300-1150: Sources and Documents\" (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1986), pp. 100–103.\n\n\n"}

The object received the find number 014 and is now on display in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, with the inventory number JE 67465.\n\nThe tomb of the young king in the East Valley of the Kings (KV62) was uncovered almost untouched in the Valley of the Kings in West Thebes by Howard Carter on 4 November 1922. The lotus chalice was one of the first objects which Carter and his excavators found on entering the tomb. The vessel was almost directly behind the entrance of the corridor to the antechamber, where they broke in, on the ground. This was not its original position.\n\nThe lotus chalice is made from a single piece of alabaster. The chalice has the shape of a lotus in full bloom. The handles on both sides are identical, shaped like lotus flowers growing upward, with the god Heh seated on a basket (the neb symbol) on the tips of the leaves. In each hand Heh holds a palm rib with notches for counting the years and a tadpole sitting on a shen ring below each one. This is a typical depiction of the god of the \"million years\", the god of infinity and eternity: the palm rib is the Hieroglyph for year, while both the shen ring and the tadpole were symbols of eternity. A kneeling image of the god was the hieroglyph for the number \"one million\". The same motif is found on other items from the tomb. For example, wooden stool (JE 62029, find number 87). At the upper end of each palm rib there is an ankh symbol, the sign of life. The chalice therefore symbolises the infinite and eternal life of King Tutankhamun.\n\nThe lotus is significant in Egyptian mythology for the birth of the sun god, who emerged from the lotus, after it had risen out of the flood of the primeval waters of Nun. The name of the king in the centre of the white open flower therefore symbolised his rebirth.\n\nThe inscriptions are engraved and filled with dark paste. Howard Carter copied the inscriptions and asked Alan Gardiner to provide a translation, since he required this for publication. The main lotus, which forms the actual chalice, had the king's throne name (\"Neb-kheperw-Re\" - Lord in Forms, Re) and personal name (\"Twt-ankh-amun\" - Living image of Amun), \"may he live forever.\" The first column names him as \"beloved of Amun-Re, Lord of the throne of the two Lands (\"Neb-neswt tawi\"), Lord of Heaven (\"Neb-pet\"). The writing runs from right to left.\n\nThe inscription on the rim of the chalice is to be read in two directions. From right to left, beginning with the Horus falcon, are the more rarely attested Horus name and Nebty name of Tutankhamun. From left to right, beginning with the ankh symbol, is the following:\nBecause of the inscription, Howard Carter called the lotus chalice the \"King's Wishing Cup\". The wish inscription from the lotus chalice is quoted on the second gravestone of Howard Carter.\n\nIn addition to being displayed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, the lotus chalice was among the original finds selected for the first temporary exhibition of the grave goods of Tutankhamun. It was also on display with the exhibition number 39 in the world-touring \"Treasures of Tutankhamun\" exhibition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6207282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6207282", "title": "Madaba Map", "text": "Madaba Map\n\nThe Madaba Map (also known as the Madaba Mosaic Map) is part of a floor mosaic in the early Byzantine church of Saint George in Madaba, Jordan. The Madaba Map is a map of the Middle East. Part of it contains the oldest surviving original cartographic depiction of the Holy Land and especially Jerusalem. It dates to the 6th century AD.\n\nThe Madaba Mosaic Map depicts Jerusalem with the Nea Church, which was dedicated on 20 November, AD 542. Buildings erected in Jerusalem after 570 are absent from the depiction, thus limiting the date range of its creation to the period between 542 and 570. The mosaic was made by unknown artists, probably for the Christian community of Madaba, which was the seat of a bishop at that time. In 614, Madaba was conquered by the Persian empire. In the 8th century AD, the Muslim Umayyad rulers had some figural motifs removed from the mosaic. In 746, Madaba was largely destroyed by an earthquake and subsequently abandoned. The mosaic was rediscovered in 1884, during the construction of a new Greek Orthodox church on the site of its ancient predecessor. Patriarch Nicodemus I of Jerusalem was informed, but no research was carried out until 1896.\n\nIn the following decades, large portions of the mosaic map were damaged by fires, activities in the new church and by the effects of moisture. In December 1964, the Volkswagen Foundation gave the \"Deutscher Verein für die Erforschung Palästinas\" (\"German Society for the exploration of Palestine\") 90,000 DM to save the mosaic. In 1965, the archaeologists Heinz Cüppers and Herbert Donner undertook the restoration and conservation of the remaining parts of the mosaic.\n\nThe floor mosaic is located in the apse of the church of Saint George at Madaba. It is not oriented northwards, like modern maps, but faces east towards the altar in such a fashion that the position of places on the map coincides with the actual compass directions. Originally, it measured 21 by 7 m and contained over two million \"tesserae\". Its current dimensions are 16 by 5 m.\n\nThe mosaic map depicts an area from Lebanon in the north to the Nile Delta in the south, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert. Among other features, it depicts the Dead Sea with two fishing boats, a variety of bridges linking the banks of the Jordan, fish swimming in the river and receding from the Dead Sea; a lion (rendered nearly unrecognisable by the insertion of random tesserae during a period of iconoclasm) hunting a gazelle in the Moab desert, palm-ringed Jericho, Bethlehem and other biblical-Christian sites. The map may partially have served to facilitate pilgrims' orientation in the Holy Land. All landscape units are labelled with explanations in Greek. A combination of folding perspective and aerial view depicts about 150 towns and villages, all of them labelled.\n\nThe largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is Jerusalem, at the centre of the map. The mosaic clearly shows a number of significant structures in the Old City of Jerusalem: the Damascus Gate, the Lions' Gate, the Golden Gate, the Zion Gate, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the New Church of the Theotokos, the Tower of David and the \"Cardo Maximus\". The recognisable depiction of the urban topography makes the mosaic a key source on Byzantine Jerusalem. Also unique are the detailed depictions of cities such as Neapolis, Askalon, Gaza, Pelusium and Charachmoba, all of them nearly detailed enough to be described as street maps.\n\nThe mosaic map of Madaba is the oldest known geographic floor mosaic in art history. It is used heavily for the localisation and verification of biblical sites. Study of the map played a major role in answering the question of the topographical location of Askalon (\"Asqalan\" on the map).\nIn 1967, excavations in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem revealed the Nea Church and the \"Cardo Maximus\" in the very locations suggested by the Madaba Map.\n\nIn February 2010, excavations further substantiated its accuracy with the discovery of a road depicted in the map that runs through the center of Jerusalem. According to the map, the main entrance to the city was through a large gate opening into a wide central street. Until the discovery, archaeologists were not able to excavate this site due to heavy pedestrian traffic. In the wake of infrastructure work near the Jaffa Gate, large paving stones were discovered at a depth of 4 meters below ground that prove such a road existed.\n\nA copy of the map is in the collection of the Archaeological Institute at Göttingen University. It was produced during the conservation work at Madaba in 1965 by archaeologists of the Rheinisches Landesmuseum, Trier. A copy produced by students of the \"Madaba Mosaic School\" is in the foyer of the Akademisches Kunstmuseum at Bonn. The lobby of the YMCA in Jerusalem has a replica of the map incorporated in the floor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26027488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26027488", "title": "Magnificence (history of ideas)", "text": "Magnificence (history of ideas)\n\nThe word magnificence comes from the Latin “magnum facere”, which means to do something great. The Latin word draws on the Greek “megaloprépeia”. This noun conveys the meaning of doing something great which is fitting or seemly to the circumstance. Magnificence is a philosophical, aesthetic and socio-economic notion deeply rooted in Western culture since classical antiquity. It regards the greatness of actions, courage, excellence, honour, generosity, and splendour of lifestyles of noble purposes.\n\nPlato offered the first philosophical interpretation of the concept of magnificence. He separated \"megalopsychía\" (magnanimity) from \"megaloprépeia\" (magnificence), which had been synonymous in archaic Greek.\n\nMagnificence is the special quality in Plato's conception of the philosopher-king, as presented in the fifth and sixth books of \"The Republic\". Only those with a philosophical and educational temperament understand the difference between good and evil. The philosopher is magnificent, gracious, the friend of truth, justice, courage and temperance, has an excellent memory, and learns easily (487 a2-8). When perfected by age and education this magnificent being is the type of person to whom the state must be entrusted.\n\nThe historians Herodotus and Xenophon proposed a social and economic interpretation of magnificence. They used the term to describe the donation of private money and property to support public works or communal needs. In ancient Greek and Middle-Eastern societies this was a widespread custom. Affluent citizens holding public positions were expected to use their own money for a wide range of activities which were deemed important by their communities.\n\nIn the \"Histories\", Herodotus gives various examples of magnificence, such as that of Polycrates (3, 123, 1); the Scythians' magnificent festivity of the goddess Cybele (4, 7, 3); Amyntas's invitation to the Persians to feast and be entertained by him with great generosity and displays of friendship (5, 18); Clisthenes's sumptuous treatment of his daughter's suitors when seeking a good marriage for her (6, 128).\n\nXenophon, in his treatise \"Oeconomicus\" introduces magnificence within the meaning of wealth and social obligations. In keeping with the phenomenon of evergetism (as outlined by Paul Veyne), affluent citizens are called upon to offer many costly sacrifices such as building all sorts of public works, such as fortifications, war boats, temples, or amphitheatres; supplying an army with all the equipment and provisions it needed; offering entertainment and shows; hosting prominent foreign guests and regaling them with lavish hospitality. Even fellow-citizens must be plied by them with all sorts of nice things. Magnificence is thus connected with liberality, high lifestyles, and wealth. Critobulus, says Socrates in the dialogue, is called upon to be magnificent in order to live up to his reputation as an affluent citizen. All these deeds give public honour to the wealthy citizens and the entire city. Xenophon extends magnificence to women. For example, Mania, the widow of Zenis, the governor of Aeolis, not only convinced the Persian satrap Pharnabazus to appoint her as the new governess, but excelled in her military, political and economic duties, never lacking in magnificence whenever it was required (\"Hellenica\", III, 10-13).\n\nIn his \"Eudemian Ethics\" and \"Nicomachean Ethics\", Aristotle offers a philosophical, ethical, and aesthetic interpretation of magnificence which exerted an extensive influence throughout the following centuries.\n\nIn the fourth book of the \"Nicomachean Ethics\", magnificence is described as the ethical virtue linked to money: \"it is a fitting expenditure involving largeness of scale\" (IV, 2, 1122a 23). However, Aristotle insists that the type of expenditure must be appropriate to the circumstance. Hence, not every type of action requires the same degree of expense. Thus, Aristotle, like Plato, consolidates the separation of the virtues of magnificence and magnanimity. Drawing on Xenophon, however, he dignifies the economic aspect of a great expenditure by turning it into an ethical virtue.\n\nWith Aristotle, magnificence also acquires an aesthetic dimension. It becomes an art in itself, requiring that one understands what type of expenditure is needed and does so tastefully. A magnificent man knows that the expenditure should be large, but appropriate to who is actually spending, the circumstance, and the object of the expense. The Aristotle scholar W. D. Ross suggested that in this conception magnificence turns out to be mainly a matter of aesthetic good taste. The aesthetic role that magnificence acquired with Aristotle exerted a profound influence on rhetoric, the arts, architecture and art criticism.\n\nCicero introduced the ethic of magnificence to ancient Roman and Italian civilization. In his youthful work on rhetoric, \"De inventione\", he writes that magnificence is \"the consideration and management of important and sublime matters with a certain wide seeing and splendid determination of mind\" (II, Liv, 163). Thus Cicero fused the Greek and Roman traditions, transforming the Greek view of magnificence into a Roman concept. The Latin word \"magnificentia\" comes from the expression \"magnum facere\", which literally means \"to do something great\". In Cicero's formulation, it refers to the greatness of the task, the intention to realize it, and the determination to carry it through. Cicero’s seminal interpretation of magnificence influenced Thomas Aquinas in his \"Summa Theologiæ\" over a thousand years later.\n\nMagnificence took on very Roman characteristics. In ancient Rome, it is a public phenomenon connected to the institutions, political power and the Roman state. The magnificence of the buildings, roads, public buildings and festivals was under the control of the aediles. Furthermore, magnificence has nothing to do with luxury. Instead, it reflects a system of republican values and virtues embraced by the traditionalist Roman oligarchy. When Cicero claims that \"the Roman people loathe private luxury (\"luxuriam\") but they love public magnificence (\"magnificentiam\")\" (\"Pro Murena\", 76), he is making an explicit reference to a political system which was being undermined by a new generation of politicians. Whereas luxury represented the use of wealth to serve personal satisfaction, magnificence rested on traditional republican values based on respect for an appropriate relationship between private and public life.\n\nIn classical rhetoric, magnificence is one of the models of the grand or elevated style. However the most important work on magnificence in the classical world is \"On Style\" (\"Perì hermēnēías\") written by Demetrius of Phalerum probably in the first century B.C. Demetrius gives a technical description of the typical features of the elevated style. The historian Thucydides and the poet Sappho are presented as the leading exponents of this style. Demetrius’s treatise did not gain the same success as Longinus’s \"On the Sublime\". Although magnificence and the sublime both belong to the grand style, there are significant differences between them. Magnificence insists more on formal correctness and stylistic solemnity. Whereas the sublime inspires awe, veneration, loss of rationality, ecstasy and pathos, the magnificent aims to impress without causing fear or indignation.\n\nThe grand style of magnificence also entered terminological discourse of ancient Greek art criticism. Indeed, the Greeks drew on rhetorical terminology to describe and evaluate sculpture, painting and architecture. Magnificence is applied to works of art which express grandeur and other lofty features.\n\nAccording to Pliny the Elder, the grand style of magnificence can be appreciated in works such as the statue of Zeus by Phidias and Zeuxis’s painting of Zeus enthroned.\n\nIn his monumental \"De architectura\", Vitruvius analyzed both the artistic-aesthetic and the philosophical-ethical aspects of the concept and enshrined magnificence in classical architecture. In the sixth book, Vitruvius argues that the client (public or private) is magnificent, because the beauty of a building depends on its cost (6, 8, 9). The materials employed should be of the best quality and the most beautiful, which means that they are usually the most expensive. Thus, for Vitruvius magnificence is not only a typical artistic and aesthetic feature of architecture, but is also connected to the social and political prestige of the client. Architecture becomes the means by which a public or private sponsor of a building can display his honour.\n\nIt is no surprise that ancient Romans granted such importance to public architecture: even the ancient historians and geographers celebrated the Romans’ ability to create buildings that were not only useful, but also beautiful and magnificent. Dionysius of Halicarnassus states that the three greatest examples of magnificent Roman architecture were the aqueducts, the roads and the sewage system (\"Roman Antiquities\" 3, 67, 5). Strabo (\"Geographica\", V, 3, 8) and Livy (\"History of Rome\", 1, 38, 5-6; 39; 44) celebrate the hygienic functions of the aqueducts and the \"cloacae\". Pliny the Elder provides a moving description of the engineering skills used to rebuild Rome's great sewage system, the \"Cloaca Maxima\", which is still in use today (\"Natural History\", 36, 104-105).\n\nThomas Aquinas left one of the most significant mediaeval interpretations of the concept of magnificence, drawing on the Graeco-Roman tradition and blending it with Christian precepts. He brings together the pagan idea of human magnificence with the Jewish-Christian mentality, according to which mankind should always be reverent towards God. In the \"Summa theologiae\" magnificence is a virtue that belongs to God, which can also be shared by men (\"Summa\", IIa IIae q. 134 art. 1). Aquinas adopts Cicero’s definition of magnificence, highlighting how it consists in doing great things. Magnificence belongs to the virtue of fortitude, or courage, because it regards the undertaking of great things and actions, and persevering even when circumstances can make their realization arduous (\"Summa\", IIa IIae q. 134 art. 1-4).\n\nDante, drawing on Aquinas, regards magnificence as a divine virtue connected to God’s grandeur and perfection. Then, following the traditions of Aristotle and Aquinas, Dante classifies magnificence as the fourth virtue \"which regulates great expenditures, in administering them and setting limits to their size\" (\"Convivio\" IV, XVII, 5).\n\nWith the advent of the Renaissance in Italy, magnificence underwent a deep transformation, drawing on this cultural movement which supported the rebirth of both classical culture and urban centres. The idea of magnificence and its representation had profound implications for Renaissance society in Italy.\n\nMagnificence acquires new vitality within the process of renewal of Italian cities as cultural and political centres. Magnificence thus reflects the transformation of traditional political structures and epitomizes the flourishing of a new type of civic culture based on virtues which diverged from the previous feudal values. A novel idea of human excellence emerged which was seen as distinct from the medieval aristocratic privileges connected to birth and rank. Marsilio Ficino in his work \"De virtutibus morabilus\" (1457) claims magnificence is the virtue par excellence, because it expresses God’s greatness. Cristoforo Landino in \"De vera nobilitate\" (1487) describes magnificence as an aspect of fortitude. The new idea of nobility emphasizes deeds and works realized by men whose behaviour is primarily governed by the cultivation of such virtues, rather than merely by noble blood and aristocratic ideals.\n\nBy the first half of the 15th century, magnificence had already become a well-known and highly practiced virtue in Renaissance Italy. It concerned the custom of wealthy citizens spending large sums of money on building projects and to patronage of architecture and the arts. In Florence, Cosimo de' Medici (the founder of the Medici dynasty) was actively involved in practising the virtue of magnificence from the 1430s onwards and many other ruling families and distinguished citizens followed suit all over Italy. Lorenzo de’ Medici gained the title “magnificent” due to his support to humanist scholars and artists, establishing one of the most sophisticated courts in Italy. Magnificence regains its ancient splendour also as an aspect of works of architecture and art. The rediscovery of ancient rhetoric and the pre-eminence given to Vitruvius throughout the Renaissance influenced not only patrons’ tastes, but also those of the architects and artists who were commissioned to create magnificent masterpieces that would give fame to the both themselves and the entire town. In the \"De re aedificatoria\", Leon Battista Alberti draws on both the philosophical and aesthetic concepts of magnificence. Many Italian Renaissance architects and artists applied magnificence both in their artworks and in their writings. Antonio Averlino, known as Filarete, Giorgio Vasari and Andrea Palladio extolled the philosophical and aesthetic aspects of magnificence. Magnificence, however, is not only a practice engaged in by distinguished citizens, princes, popes, architects and artists, but is also analyzed by humanist scholars. In Naples, the humanist and poet Giovanni Pontano wrote a philosophical and ethical treatise \"De magnificentia\" (1498). Magnificence was connected with the employment of wealth on behalf of the Neapolitan kings and aristocracy, and their lifestyles. Pontano’s \"De magnificentia\" and his other philosophical treatises on the use of wealth and the role of the prince probably anticipated the courtier’s ethic and the doctrine of how to behave appropriately, which would find the most mature expression in 16th-century Italian literature thanks to Baldassare Castiglione’s \"Book of the Courtier\" (1528) and Giovanni Della Casa’s \"Il Galateo\" (1558).\n\nDuring the 18th century Italy had become one of the main destinations of the Grand Tour visitors, who came from Northern Europe to study and admire Italian art and architecture, and also to absorb classical culture. With Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778), magnificence received one of its final interpretations in the Italian cultural context. Universally known as the etcher of the \"Prisons\" and the \"Views\" of Roman monuments, Piranesi was an eclectic personality, who pursued a wide range of interests. Giovanni Battista Piranesi had a prominent role within the Graeco-Roman debate. In this controversy Piranesi supported the superiority of the architects and designers of the Roman Empire and demonstrated the indigenous roots of Roman culture, arguing that the Romans had been influenced more by the Etruscans than the Greeks. In his polemical treatise \"Della Magnificenza ed Architettura de’ Romani\" (\"Concerning the Magnificence and Architecture of the Romans\") (1761) Piranesi draws on the entire heritage of the philosophical, ethical, economic and artistic aspects of the notion. He controversially conceives magnificence as a virtue which was shared by the entire ancient Roman population. Furthermore, he argues that the Romans used the most advanced technical and hydraulic skills, and the finest materials available. They excelled in public buildings and proved they were better at them than the Greeks.\n"}

Made in the cultural center of Fez, it is crafted of the finest materials: silk velvet embroidered with gold metallic thread.\n\nThe seven panels of this wall hanging, in alternating crimson and emerald velvet, were sewn not by women, as was typical of Moroccan embroidery, but by professional male needleworkers. That is because this \"haiti\" represents the most prestigious and complicated form of textile. The men were under close supervision by the leatherworkers' guild, since the work was so complex it required custom-made leather templates. They stitched around the templates with a special technique known as underside couching that kept the precious gold thread from being wasted on the unseen underside. The interlaced \"mihrab\" motif, echoing a mosque's arch-shaped niche, makes this wall hanging a magnificent backdrop for special occasions.\n\nArtisans in Fez had been creating sumptuous wall hangings like this since the 16th century. Magnificent embroideries of this particular type, with their large size and architectural elements, were reserved for very grand occasions such as the week-long weddings of the very wealthy. They provided a suitable backdrop for the bride in her lavish finery.\n\nIn 2003, the IMA loaned this artwork to the National Museum of African Art as part of an exhibit entitled \"The Fabric of Moroccan Art,\" which was sponsored by Mohammed VI, king of Morocco. Of the dozens of textiles displayed, this one was lauded as \"One of the most important pieces in the exhibition--and in the IMA's entire textile collection.\"\n\nThis \"haiti\" was donated to the IMA by Eliza M. and Sarah L.

The Niblack family had acquired it when Admiral Albert Parker Niblack, Eliza's brother, was stationed in Gibraltar in 1917. His discerning eye led to a collection of 2,500 Moroccan, European, and Indonesian textiles, all of which found their way into the IMA's collection. The family's generosity means the museum holds one of the most important collections of Moroccan textiles in the United States, since most institutions focus on Turkish and Persian textiles.\n\n"}

The show is a collaboration between companies Nelvana Limited, Playmates Toys, and The Topps Company. The show was created by Sean Jara, who is also the executive story editor and producer. It was originally aimed at boys but switched its focus to girls aged 6 to 11, as per Nickelodeon's preference during the development process. \n\nIn August 2018, Jara confirmed on Twitter that \"Mysticons\" was not renewed for any episodes beyond its initial 40-episode production order. The final episode of the series aired on September 15, 2018 in the United States and September 23, 2018 in Canada.\n\nAn ongoing series of comic books (graphic novels) and chapter books had been first released on August, 28, 2018. Volume 2 being released on March, 2019 and Volume 3 in the spring of 2019.\nThe chapter books depict dozens of original adventures that never occurred in the animated series; each featuring each Mysticon as the central character; each set within a particular season of the television show.\n\nIn the mystical world of Gemina, in a place called Drake City, four teenage girls are chosen by the all-powerful Dragon Disk to become legendary heroes known as the Mysticons. Arkayna, Emerald, Zarya and Piper undertake an arduous quest to find four spellbooks and animal-themed bracers of mystical power to form the Codex. This will grant them their full strength and abilities necessary to save their world from Dreadbane, who seeks to release Necrafa, the leader of the Spectral Hand and Queen of the Undead. When Necrafa is freed she betrays Dreadbane and throws him into where she was once banished this happens in the 13th episode.\nWhile fulfilling various quests to bring harmony and order to the realm, the Mysticons encounter several trusty allies and devious adversaries. A startling revelation is that Arkayna has a fraternal twin sister. Unfortunately, as their sisterly union would result in the imminent release of the dangerous Spectral Dragon, Nova Terron had been ordered to send the younger princess twin to an alternate dimension on the astral plane. Unable to bring himself to do so, he sent her to a fairy orphanage hidden from mortal eyes. \n\nThe Mysticons succeed in finding a blue-green birth gem in the vault of the Dragon, which is revealed to belong to the mysterious and immensely powerful Astromancer Proxima Starfall, who had stayed at the orphanage until taken in by the Astromancers at a young age. \n\nIt is later revealed that Arkayna's real fraternal twin sister is the second Mysticon Ranger, Zarya Moonwolf. Proxima's blue-green birth gem had been purposefully switched with Zarya's as a cover-up to protect her true identity, thus making Proxima's family history nothing but a complete fabrication. \nHaving had a vision, Arkayna and Zarya head to Mount Tryanus to obtain two yellow rings which transform them into the Twin Dragon, enabling them to obliterate both the Spectral Dragon and Necrafa in one single strike; an act that leaves half of her mysterious mask behind.\n\nWith Queen Necrafa and the Spectral Dragon destroyed, Arkayna, Zarya, Emerald and Piper are enjoying their lives. However, they are needed once again to destroy a surviving fragment of Necrafa's mask by tossing it into the fiery core of the Rift of Ruin, a volcanic trench in the depths of the sea. Proxima accompanies them as an Astromancer, but is secretly lonely and bitter; she deceives them into believing that she had destroyed the mask fragment while keeping it to seek vengeance against those who had deceived her about her family history, mistrusted her judgement and underestimated her powerful magical abilities. Meanwhile, Nova Terron and the other Astromancers enlist Malvaron, Doug, and Choko on a special mission to get Tazma out of Necrafa's old lair before they destroy it. To save Tazma they use a shrinking potion and imprison her in a snow-globe which she escapes twice. Though Necrafa's lair and Necrafa herself are destroyed, Tazma still uses the dark magic and knowledge from both in later episodes while reminiscing from time to time. After the lair's destruction it is never seen again so, the, turned evil, Proxima uses Astromancer Academy for her dark magic doings. Proxima turns her former master, Nova Terron, and fellow top-level Astromancers into her mindless, masked minions: Spectromancers. She snatches the Dragon Disk and fully corrupts the ancient and all-powerful artifact with evil magic. After succeeding in creating her very own Dark Codex, she calls upon four female warriors called the Vexicons, from its dark and sinister pages to combat the Mysticons. This leaves her free to achieve the necessary steps for her ultimate revenge on Arkayna, for making her believe that she had a family and was loved in the realm, and for Zarya getting everything she would have had.\n\nThings have escalated further, as Proxima has now been fully possessed by the evil within the half Necrafa's mask; having worn it for so long it had caused its intense dark power to become deeply attached to Proxima and chose her as its rightful host. To help remove the mask off of Proxima who is out cold before the Vexicons arrive at the Stronghold to take the mask, Tazma tells Arkayna a spell that traps the Mysticons inside Proxima's subconscious mind, in which they see Proxima’s memories and learn of her troubled and lonely childhood since leaving Mrs. Sparklebottom's sanctuary, to the point of choosing the dark powers of the mask fragment because of an oblivious Princess Arkayna never being truly there for her as a sister and for breaking her heart so badly. After freeing Proxima of the evil, stronger hold the mask's fragment had on her, Arkayna apologizes for her non sister-like actions and welcomes Proxima back as her honorary twin sister.\nProxima explains all she had learned while under the evil influence of the mask; how the Spectral Hand has tempted and manipulated many over the millennia; such as Necrafa (who was, in fact, a powerful elven sorceress), Captain Kaos, and finally Mallory. With the piece of the mask having taken over her as it did Proxima, Mallory takes charge and has her three Vexicon sisters help her in releasing the ravenous wrath of the Spectral Hand's beast upon Drake City. Proxima reverses the dark spell on the mindless Spectromancers, turning them all back into top Astromancers- Nova Terron, Gandobi and Quasarla- who fend off the tentacles of the ancient ruins, from which the Spectral Hand is imprisoned. \n\nRunning out options, the Mysticons turn to Dreadbane, as he is the only one who can return Queen Goodfey and King Darius to life. He initially refuses but comes his senses when a human boy he saved asks him his name, to which he says it is \"General Bane.\" He rises to the occasion as an unexpected ally and prevents the bone statues of the queen and king from being destroyed. However, he is gravely wounded when taking a fatal blow for Arkayna, from Mallory's greater snowy blast. He uses the last of his strength, before turning into stardust, to undo the spell he himself had cast to fully restore Princess Arkayna and Zarya's mother and stepfather to living flesh and blood, after being frozen in time for so many months. Arkayna reunites with her mother, and introduces her to Zarya Moonwolf who addresses her as \"Mom\", to the Queen's confusion. Her brief memories of the newborn Zarya are returned to her by Nova Terron (off-screen) and she provides the blueprints for the four mystical Lances of Justice which were hidden in her necklace for safekeeping. She accompanies her twin daughters (riding Zarya on Archer, much to Arkayna's resentment and envy), Emerald and Piper on their ultimate quest to stop to Vexicons and finally eradicate the Spectral Hand. Zarya finally comes to the realization that the Spectral Hand does have a great weakness: the Dragons of Light.\nThey all go to the sacred realm of Dragonhenge and see King Valmuk and his baby daughter Stormy again. They see the hidden, remaining yellow dragon eggs. King Valmuk explains that by only being given a boost from the ancient time magic of the Ever Realm can dragons be strong enough by reaching full adulthood more quickly. This plan works but, the Vexicons trap the Mysticons before they can strike the demon of the Spectral Hand. Em & the others beg for the help of Eartha, who they saved from crumbling in the episode, \"Heart Of Stone.\" Eartha frees the Mysticons before the other Vexicons banish the girls and she destroys Mallory's hair making the Ice Witch lose all confidence and surrender (Unseen). The Mysticons ride the dragons to the Spectral Hand demon and use their enhanced bracers, powered by lancers, to strike the Spectral Hand demon thus, sending it into oblivion and returning peace to the land forever. Some loose ends are also tied up such as, the Vexicons are imprisoned (possibly in the Necrafa prison dimension). Eartha remains unpunished for helping the Mysticons restore peace to all of Gemina. Nova Terron steps down as leader of the Astromancers and announces Proxima, his second-in-command, as the new leader/Star Mistress of the Academy, as he leaves on adventures across the astral plane with his longtime girlfriend/starmate Geraldine Yaga. The mask's remains are thrown into the Rift of Ruin and destroyed forever.\n\nThe Mysticons are four teenage girls whose destiny it is to use unique mystical powers and weaponry to defend the world of Gemina and its inhabitants from evil forces, namely the Spectral Hand. A generation of Mysticons is chosen once every thousand years by the ancient and powerful Dragon Disk. Their unique Mysticon abilities and weaponry become a hundred times greater and more effective when the Codex is combined into one larger spellbook, which happened to have been drained dry of its magic by Queen Necrafa herself. The second generation of legendary Mysticons are:\n\n\nFour, dark female warriors called from the pages of Proxima's Dark Codex. They debut as shadowed cameos at the end of \"Happily Never After\", but make their full debut in \"The Lost Scepter\" where they race the Mysticons to find an ancient and immensely powerful mind-controlling scepter that belonged to one of Gemina's centuries-old king. They are considered the dark counterparts of the Mysticons. They each have their own dark animal bracer, to combat those of light wielded by the Mysticons:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Astromancers are an ancient league of mages (sorcerers and sorceresses) who have protected Gemina. They reside at the Astromancer Academy. Those of the top level have a deep purple magical aura while mid-level Astromancers have a light orange magical aura.\n\n\n\n\nA group of sky pirates who plunder and pillage whatever they find. They were founded several years ago when Zarya was a young orphan girl in Drake City. \n\nFierce and brave mermaid/mermen warriors who possess the ancient and very powerful silver tridents of myth. According to Emerald, children's tales of them have been famous for many, many years:\n\nMillennium ago, the ancient and mighty Dragons of Light had fought a fiercely violent final battle in their sacred homeland of Dragonhenge. Unfortunately, thousands had fallen and were thought to be extinct at the hand of one of the Spectral Dragons. Until a dragon egg was discovered by the second generation of Mysticons, which hatched an infant storm dragon whom Arkayna decided to christen \"Stormy.\"\nThey seem to have replaced the everlasting faithful griffin mounts- Izzie, Archer, Miss Paisley and Topaz- as the Mysticons are seen on the dragons backs in the last scene of the show.\n\n\nIn addition to its four spellbooks, each Mysticon dons a jeweled bracer that represents their own animal which can also be used underwater: \n\n\nThese are the four immensely powerful magic-infused weaponry belonging to the Mysticons, four legendary heroes who defend the realm of Gemina and its people from any evil. They were created by the ancient, all-powerful Dragon Disk which had chosen the original Mysticons a millennia ago. They are used constantly rather than the special power each Mysticon possesses: \n\nThese are the magic-infused weapons of the Vexicons, the four evil counterparts of the Mysticons. Each is somewhat similar to the weapons of light wielded by the Mysticons. Only Willa does not display any actual weapon, but prefers her Vexicon abilities; her \"Doom Boom\" attack and teleporting via purple smoke.\n\nThese are the unique superpowers and abilities each of the four Mysticons possess, but for some reason are never used or relied upon as constantly as their weapons are. Some are psionic/psychic/extrasensory, while others are what fairies and pixies possess. Only the special abilities of Zarya Moonwolf and Emerald Goldenbraid were never revealed in the show:\n\nIn the United States, \"Mysticons\" premiered on Nickelodeon through a 5-day event over the week starting August 28, 2017, before moving to its regular Sunday morning timeslot. \"Mysticons\" began airing on Nicktoons on August 30.

{"id": "4701581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4701581", "title": "Retablo", "text": "Retablo\n\nA retablo in Mexican folk art (also lámina) is a devotional painting, especially a small popular or folk art one using iconography derived from traditional Catholic church art. More generally \"retablo\" is also the Spanish term for a retable or reredos above an altar, whether a large altarpiece painting or an elaborate wooden structure with sculptures. Typically this includes painting, sculpture or a combination of the two, and an elaborate framework enclosing it. The Latin etymology of the Spanish word means \"board behind\". Aside from being found behind the altar, \"similar ornamental structures are built and carved over facades and doorways\" (Fernandez 23), called overdoors. \n\nSmall retablos are devotional or votive paintings, often on rectangular sheets of tin that illustrate holy images such as Christ, the Virgin Mother, or one of the hundreds of saints. Many are ex-votos (\"from a vow\") that depict the story that led to their commission, usually dangerous or threatening events that actually occurred, and which the person survived, thanks to the intercession of a sacred person - God, Mary or a saint. They are made as a way of thanking the sacred person for protection in precarious situations, such as surviving an illness or earthquake. This class of ex-votos often shows the protected humans in the dangerous situation, and the sacred person who protected them, usually with an inscribed explanation of the events, with the date and location. Both devotional and especially ex-voto retablos may be deposited at a shrine as a votive offering, or alternatively kept at home. \n\nReredos of the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance in Spain grew extremely large and elaborate, typically using carved and gilded wood, and rising as high as 40 feet or more. The tradition of making them was taken to the new Spanish Empire in America. There, by the late 18th century at least, the word became used for much smaller popular religious paintings, both conventional devotional images and ex-votos (paintings giving thanks for protection through a specific episode). These were typically made to express gratitude towards the Virgin Mary for saving a person or a loved one from a nearly fatal event.\n\nThe popular labeling of ex-votos as \"Retablos\" can be traced back to the late 18th century. In 1950, Mexican artist Roberto Montenegro published a history of Mexican altarpieces, which included a votive painting dated 1781, that contained an inscription which offers thanks to Nuestra Señora de Dolores de Xaltocan for renewing the people's health after a severe illness. On the bottom of the votive painting left, is inscribed a message that read \"en cuia memoria dedica a su Magestad este Retablo\" (in whose memory he dedicates to her Majesty this \"retablo\").\n\nThe oil painted retablos generated the need for \"small retablo factories\" to be established in order to \"reproduce the same images\" which were then \"sold to devout believers who displayed them in home altars to honor their patron Saints.\" Not only were the retablos purchased by those wanting to show devotion to their patron saints, they were also given when the saints were there for their devotees in hard times. When people wished to express gratitude, they could give retablos that described \"the miraculous deed of a saint to whom the petitioner turned to in a time of need\" (Correa 113). People call upon these saints for aid with rain, harvests or other outcomes. For example, if a farmer needs rain for his crops he might pray for rain. After the rain comes, a retablo might be created to give thanks to San Ysidro Labrador, the patron saint of farmers. He is \"venerated for good weather, agricultural issues and prosperous crops\" (Eddy, 1). That figure would most likely be kept in the farmer's house. Each time rain was needed in the future, that farmer might pray in front of that retablo (Eddy, 1). These traditions are by no means exclusive to Latin America, but are found in all Roman Catholic countries, as well as in classical paganism and many other religions. To judge by survivals, similar small paintings were especially common in the German-speaking Catholic areas of Europe in the Early Modern period. By the 19th century, the process of lithography became very popular for devotional retablos, replacing earlier printmaking methods.\n\nThe way a retablo and ex-voto look is entirely up to the person designing it, so long as it contains the necessary basic elements. The most important part of the retablo is the representation of the miraculous event. That is why most artists try to use bright, vibrant colors to portray the supremacy of the event. An ex-voto is, more often than not, reduced to a smaller size. It is usually about half the size of the original, while still maintaining its rectangular shape. The largest size was about 280 square inches. The smallest was about 18 square inches. Some of the most common sizes include 140 square inches and 70 square inches (Durand, 9).\n\nRetablos are important to Mexican folk religion because they are a physical representation of holy images such as Christ, the Virgin Mother, or one of the many thousands of saints. They come from the need humans have to interact on a personal level with divine spirits. Retablos are evidentiary support for communication between the divine and humans (Wroth, 2).\n\nThis tradition of retablos was also brought into New Mexico and southern Colorado by Franciscan monks. Due to the remoteness of this frontier and lack of metals, retablos were made of wood. These crude retablos were coated with a gesso made with gypsum and rabbit skin glue. Pigments also were made locally from natural materials, colored earths, plant extracts, cochineal bugs, and lamp black.\n\nThese traditional retablos and other indigenous religious art were removed by Bishop Lamy throughout New Mexico after the conquest of these territories by the US Army. In 1924 the Spanish Colonial Arts Society was formed, and since then these unique traditions of New Mexico have been preserved.\n\nDuring the 1940s, a resurgence of the art began in Peru, due in large part to the research and philanthropy of Alicia Bustamante, a member of the Peruvian indigenista movement, who encouraged an artist named Joaquin Lopez Antay to save and revitalize the retablo art form. She enlisted him \"to make retablos that included themes of everyday life – harvests, markets, and fiestas. A distinction emerged between the retablo for ritual and religious purposes and the retablo as decoration.\" Many others in the area, including Nicario Jimenez Quispe, continued along the same path as Antay, creating a popular art that was displayed during annual branding ceremonies of cattle, sheep, and llamas. These retablos have achieved status as important heirlooms passed on within families that symbolize protection, fertility and healing. They are also sold as art.\n\n\n"}

She told him she was an enchanted princess, and if a man stayed in a little room from ten until midnight for three nights running, she would be freed. Every night creatures came into the room and beat him, but the princess had a bottle that cured him every morning.\n\nShe went off and told him she would back in a coach and six. A little lad came, and when he went to wait for the princess, the lad stuck a pin in his coat, putting him to sleep. When the princess came, the lad told her he was asleep. The princess said she would come once more, and then he would not see her again. The Irishman resolved to keep awake, but the boy stuck the pin in his coat again, and the princess left, leaving him a sword.\n\nHe woke up the other men in the castle and gave them silver and plate to carry away and set out in search of her. Three years later, he pulled out the sword in order to kill himself and found written on it, You will find me in the Blue Mountains. He set out in search of the Blue Mountains and found an old man who had not seen anyone in three hundred years. The old man, that night, looked through his book, which contained the history of the world, but found nothing of where the Blue Mountains were. He blew a magical whistle, which let the Irishman travel to his brother's, nine hundred miles away, in a day. This brother summoned all the birds to consult them. Last of all, an eagle came; it had come from the Blue Mountains. The eagle said that the daughter of the king of the Blue Mountains was about to marry, because she had agreed with her father that if the man who had saved her had not arrived in that time, she would marry. \n\nThe eagle said if they killed sixty cattle and the Irishman would throw quarter of one into its mouth every time it turned its head, it could carry him. So he and the old man hunted, and it flew off with him and the meat, but near the castle, the meat ran out, and the eagle threw him off. He landed in the bay and was able to get ashore. He gave a guinea to the king's henwife to bring the princess to him. She recognized the Irishman and married him instead of her new bridegroom.\n\n"}

Both \"The Garden\" and \"The Prison\" are written to have the music complement a novel included in the release (also written by Nesmith). \"The Prison\" and \"The Garden\" were re-released together on CD in 2004 by Video Ranch.\n\nThe idea is for listeners to read the novel while simultaneously listening to the recording. Even though \"The Garden\" was released on Nesmith's record company, Rio Records, the novella/album concept was the driving force behind Nesmith's multimedia company Pacific Arts.\n\nIn the liner notes, Nesmith states \"The Garden\" is not a sequel in the strictest sense of the term — meaning that there isn't a true continuation of the narrative which began in \"The Prison\". Instead, they are correlated thematically and stylistically as both are presented in a linear and consecutive approach. Each of \"The Garden's\" seven chapters are also visually enhanced, if not somewhat inspired by a series of Claude Monet paintings. There is a much more subtle connection between the prose and these unqualified masterworks, yet he is able to relate them in a contextual sense.\n\nAllmusic writes \"the music retains Nesmith's inimitable and signature sound, yet compared to his most concurrent effort, Tropical Campfires (1992), The Garden is exceedingly ethereal and more often than not instrumental. There are vocals that feature not only the artist, but also his children Jason — who is likewise the central character in the short story — Christian, and Jessica. The backing band also includes Christian Nesmith as well as most of the musicians the senior Nez had collaborated with on the aforementioned Tropical Campfires, most notably Desert Rose Band string man John Jorgenson (guitar/sax/bassoon/mandolin/oboe/bandurila/mandocello), Joe Chemay (bass), and John Hobbs (keyboards), as well as studio maven Sid Page (violin)\".\n\nAccording to the liner notes, the album was recorded at various times between October 1991 and September 1993 at Footprint Studios and Trax in Los Angeles.

{"id": "5989776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5989776", "title": "The Peasant Wedding", "text": "The Peasant Wedding\n\nThe Peasant Wedding is a 1567 genre painting by the Dutch Renaissance painter and printmaker Pieter Bruegel the Elder, one of his many depicting peasant life. It is currently housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Pieter Bruegel the Elder enjoyed painting peasants and different aspects of their lives in so many of his paintings that he has been called Peasant-Bruegel, but he was in fact a sophisticated intellectual, and many of his paintings have a symbolic meaning and also a moral aspect.\n\nThe bride is in front of the green textile wall-hanging, with a paper-crown hung above her head. She is also wearing a crown on her head, and she is sitting passively, not participating in the eating or drinking taking place around her. The Bridegroom is not in attendance of the wedding feast in accordance to Flemish custom. The feast is in a barn in the summertime; two sheaves of grain with a rake recalls the work that harvesting involves, and the hard life peasants have. The plates are carried on a door off its hinges. The main food was bread, porridge and soup. Other features of the scene include two pipers playing the pijpzak, an unbreeched boy in the foreground licking a plate, the wealthy man at the far right feeding a dog by putting bread on the bench, and a mysterious extra foot seen under the load of dishes being carried by the two men in the right foreground. The scene is claimed to depict an accurate portrayal of the 16th-century way of celebrating a peasant wedding.\n\nThere has been much conjecture as to the identity of the groom in this painting. Gilbert Highet has argued that the groom is the man in the centre of the painting, wearing a dark coat and seen in profile, or the ill-bred son of a wealthy couple, seen against the far wall, to the right of the bride, eating with a spoon, same as Gustav Glück. It has also been suggested that according to contemporary custom, the groom is not seated at the table but may be the man pouring out beer. Or he may be according to the same custom serving the food instead. According to this theory, the groom is the young man wearing a red cap, who is serving his guests the food, handing out plates to his guests.\n\nIn a Freudian vein, Rudy Rucker speculates:\n\nSome authors have even suggested that the groom is not even included in the painting. Van der Elst speculated that this could be the depiction of an old Flemish proverb, like some of \"There is an old Flemish proverb: 'It is a poor man who is not able to be at his own wedding.' That seems to be the case here.\" \nSome argued that it is a presentation of the mystical Wedding of Cana.\nLindsay and Bernard Huppé speculated that the painting was a Christian allegory, symbolizing corruption, depicting the corrupted Church, which was supposed to be the bride of Christ, but the groom has not appeared to claim his corrupt bride.\n\nThe painting was parodied in \"Asterix in Belgium\".\nAnother parody was the postcard for the Belgian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1979.\n\n"}

W. Robertson, was an English dramatist and innovative stage director best known for a series of realistic or naturalistic plays produced in London in the 1860s that broke new ground and inspired playwrights such as W.S. Gilbert and George Bernard Shaw.\n\nBorn in Newark-upon-Trent, Nottinghamshire, England, Robertson was the oldest son of William Robertson, a provincial actor and manager. His family was famous for producing actors. The actress Margaret (Madge) Robertson was his youngest sister. As a child, Robertson acted in juvenile parts in \"Rob Roy\", \"Pizarro\", \"The Stranger\", \"French\" parts and eccentric comedy on the Lincoln Circuit and at the Marylebone in London. He also visited Paris as the stage manager and interpreter for an English company. Never a successful actor himself, he wrote numerous plays, mostly comedies, many of which achieved popularity. Robertson died at the age of 42 and is buried, as is his wife Elizabeth, at Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington.\n\nAs a dramatist, Robertson began with adaptations of Dickens novels and wrote music hall songs for comedians. He produced a farcical comedy, \"A Night's Adventure\" at London's Olympic Theatre in 1851, but this did not catch on, and he remained for several more years in the provinces, acting and continuing with play writing and writing for newspapers. In 1860, he moved to London and worked as an editor, also writing a novel, later dramatised under the title \"Shadow Tree Shaft\". He also wrote a farce entitled \"A Cantab\", which was played at the Royal Strand Theatre in 1861. This brought him a reputation among a Bohemian clique of writers, the \"Fun\" magazine gang (including W. S. Gilbert, Tom Hood, Clement Scott, and F. C. Burnand), but so little profit that he thought of abandoning the profession to become a tobacconist. Finally, in 1864, he had his first notable playwriting success, \"David Garrick\", produced at the Haymarket Theatre with Edward Sothern in the title role. Robertson also wrote the libretto to the 1865 comic opera \"Constance\", with music by Frederic Clay.\n\nRobertson found fame in 1865 with the production of his comedy \"Society\", under the management of Squire Bancroft and his wife Marie (née Wilton) at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in the West End. The play includes a scene that fictionalized the \"Fun\" gang, who frequented the Arundel Club, the Savage Club, and especially Evans's café, where they had a table in competition with the \"Punch\" 'Round table'. This play became regarded as a milestone in Victorian drama because of its realism in sets, costume, acting and dialogue.\n\nAll of Robertson's popular plays, except for \"David Garrick\", were produced by the Bancrofts at the Prince of Wales's Theatre. Other Robertson successes included the domestic dramas \"Ours\" (1866), \"Caste\" (1867), \"Play\" (1868), \"School\" (1869), and \"M.P.\" (1870). He also wrote \"Dreams\" for the Gaiety Theatre, London, which opened that new theatre in 1868 together with Gilbert's \"Robert the Devil\". His last play, \"War\", was produced at the St. James's Theatre in 1871, the year in which he died. Robertson's plays are still occasionally seen. For example, \"Ours\" was given a professional production in July 2007 at the Finborough Theatre, London.\n\nRobertson's plays became known as 'problem plays', because they dealt seriously and sensitively with issues of the day. In the 1850s and 1860s, Robertson's plays, both in style and substance, were considered revolutionary. \"Caste\" was about marriage across the class barrier and explored prejudices towards social climbing. These plays were notable for their \"cup and saucer\" realism, treating contemporary British subjects in settings that were realistic, unlike the oversize acting in Victorian melodramas that were popular at the time. For example, whereas previously a designer would put as many chairs into a dining room scene as there were actors who needed to sit down, Robertson would place on stage as many chairs as would realistically be found in that dining room, even if some were never actually used. Or, if someone came in from a blizzard, snow would blow in from the doorway. In \"Ours\", a pudding was made on stage, and this caused a major furore – people were not used to seeing such realistic tasks in a stage setting. Also, the characters spoke in normal language and dealt with ordinary situations rather than declaiming their lines.\n\nIn addition, the importance of everyday incidents, the revealing of character through apparent \"small talk\", and the idea that what is not said in the dialogue is as important as what is said are all Robertson trademarks. Some critics wrote that there was nothing in Robertson's plays but commonplace life represented without a trace of wit and sparkle, but many admired the new style of play and new style of acting. George Bernard Shaw called Robertson's play \"Caste\" \"epoch making\" and referred to Robertson's innovations as a \"theatrical revolution\". It is now disputed whether Robertson really originated some of his innovations, but \"Society\" and its successors were viewed at the time as something new and, in a quiet way, revolutionary.\n\nThe Bancrofts, impressed with Robertson's dedication and skill, gave Robertson unusual artistic freedom to control his scripts and direct (or as it was then called, \"stage manage\") his plays. Before Robertson and James Robinson Planché, star actors generally had control of scripts, and theatre managers had control of casting in the theatre. Robertson insisted on retaining control over his scripts and casting and required that his actors follow his directions - a novel concept at that time. Robertson directed his own plays and aimed to get rid of the unreal stylisation and bombast of the old melodramas. He did not act in his plays but instead took on the role of a professional director to control the action on stage. W. S. Gilbert attended Robertson's rehearsals to learn from the older playwright's use of \"stagecraft\" and personally directed his own plays and operas based on what he had learned. Gilbert later recalled:\n\nWhy, he invented stage management. It was an unknown art before his time. Formerly, in a conversation scene for instance, you simply brought down two or three chairs, and people sat down and talked, and when the conversation was ended the chairs were replaced. Robertson showed how to give life and variety and nature to the scene, by breaking it up with all sorts of little incidents and delicate by-play. I have been at many of his rehearsals and learnt a great deal from them.\n\nThese pioneers opened the way for later proponents of realism in drama, such as Shaw, and for modern methods of play production. Robertson was also a leader in requiring a fee from his managers for every performance of his plays, thus pioneering the modern royalty system.\n\n\n"}

Besides creating photographs for the promotion of a film, the still photographer contributes daily to the filming process by creating set stills. With these, the photographer is careful to record all details of cast wardrobe, set appearance and background. The director and assistants review these images frequently for continuity and matching of all stage aspects.\n\nCornel Lucas, a pioneer of film portraiture in the 1940s and 1950s, was the first still photographer to be awarded a BAFTA, in 1998, for work with the British Film Industry.\n\nUsing individual frames from film or recorded video material is not practical due to their relatively low quality. Much higher resolution images are therefore used. Typically, the end uses of these still photos include the film's theatrical release poster, DVD box artwork, the official web site photos, billboards, bus stop adverts, point-of-purchase displays, key art image sets released to the press and media, and other printed and online collateral materials.\n\nUnit still photographers are also responsible for creating \"photo props\" and \"set dressing images\", the photos and images used on-camera to create various illusions such as forensic photos, crime drama booking photos, character driver's licenses, passport and I.D. photos, on-screen family photos, surveillance photos, computer screen displays, and any other image a producer may require in the course of a production.\n\nIn North America in particular, and some international locations, a unit still photographer must be a member of IATSE Local 600 International Cinematographers Guild in order to perform services on union productions and union studio lots and locations. The most prestigious of these unit still photographers are members of The Society of Motion Picture Still Photographers, an organization which promotes the work of those within the industry.\n\nWhile often perceived as a \"glamour\" job for photographers, the reality is often long hours (70-plus hours per week) on remote locations under difficult and often extreme conditions. The unit still photographer often coordinates with the unit publicist, but physically works in close proximity to the film's camera crew, director and actors, and also in close proximity to the film's boom microphone operator. Unit still photographers go to great lengths to muffle the sound of their camera's motor drive and shutter to avoid distracting the actors, and to remain inaudible on the film's recorded dialogue soundtrack.\n\nTypically, this is accomplished using a sound blimp, which is a sound-absorbing, foam-filled metal case in which the still camera body is fitted with a proprietary remote operation cable. This allows the camera to be activated and operated from a two-button (activation, focus and shutter release) exterior control. Limitations exist once the blimp is closed around the camera, as one can no longer access the cameras controls (f-number, shutter speed, ASA/ISO settings) or menu displays directly. The LCD display for reviewing the images will also be obscured in the closed position. This requires the photographer to make control selections in advance, and use with those settings until the take in progress has been \"cut\", making adjustments only between takes or set-ups. Unit still photographers in this field typically produce over 2000 marketable images per week for their major-studio clients. Still photography involves the use of alignment, positioning, and other techniques to capture the \"money shot\". Still-life photography is the depiction of inanimate subject matter, most typically a small grouping of objects that are either human-made or natural.\n\nSince 2010, high-end DSLR cameras, which can be remotely controlled with mobile apps on smartphones and tablet computers, using the built-in 2-way Wi-Fi radio-controlled interface between the tablet and the DSLR camera, and offer internal \"active noise reduction\" technologies, have increased the ability of the unit still photographer to work quietly on the set.\n\n\n\n"}

The piece is given by many organizations to new parents of children with special needs issues such as Down syndrome. As a testament to its popularity, several individuals have received the first name \"Holland\".\n\nEmily Kingsley is the mother of Jason Kingsley. The younger Kingsley is an actor who has appeared on programs such as \"Sesame Street\" and enjoyed a varied career, despite the family being told early in his childhood that his struggles would prevent him from having a meaningful life. \"Welcome to Holland\", written in the second person, employs a metaphor of excitement for a vacation to Italy that first becomes disappointment when the plane lands instead in Holland and then contentment at the happy events which they experience instead.\n\nThe metaphor is that the trip to Italy is a typical birth and child-raising experience, and that the trip to Holland is the experiencing of having and raising a child with special needs.\n\nIn the end, however, the reader sees that the \"trip\" is still well worth it:\n\nAuthor and social activist Emily Perl Kingsley wrote the piece based on her experiences with her son, Jason Kingsley, and her changing beliefs through parenthood. The younger Kingsley was born in 1974 with Down syndrome. Their doctor labeled the child as a \"mongoloid\" that would fail to learn to speak or walk and instructed the parents to act essentially as if the birth hadn't happened, with the mother sent to receive tranquilizing drugs preventing lactation. She recounted that she cried for several days straight.\n\nAlthough such medical attitudes were consistent with the prejudices of the time, the distraught family resisted and determined to provide the boy with as intellectually stimulating an environment as possible. Accounts of widespread abuse as a result of controversial institutionalization policies served to spur them on even more. The younger Kingsley has worked as an actor, appearing on programs such as \"Sesame Street\", and otherwise enjoyed a varied career despite various challenges.\n\nAs a testament to its popularity, several individuals have received the first name \"Holland\". In 2004, Will Livingston wrote a song loosely based on the story. He also used the title \"Welcome to Holland\".\n\nCritical analysis of the work and its influence has compared it to poet Robert Frost's piece \"The Road Not Taken\", which also discusses the human tendency to look back and fret about 'what might have been' after people make decisions.\n\nA response essay describing the possible toll that parenting can take on a family's welfare, such as raising children with severe autism, was created titled \"Welcome to Beirut\", with the later piece alluding to the suffering from the Lebanese Civil War. \"Welcome to Holland\" has also attracted some amused, humorous responses from individuals living in both Holland and Italy in contrast to the original story's American perspective.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53626404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53626404", "title": "William and Mary style", "text": "William and Mary style\n\nWhat later came to be known as the William and Mary style is a furniture design common from 1700 to 1725 in the Netherlands, the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of Scotland, and later, in England's American colonies. It was a transitional style between Mannerist furniture and Queen Anne furniture. Sturdy, emphasizing both straight lines and curves, and featuring elaborate carving and woodturning, the style was one of the first to imitate Asian design elements such as japanning.\n\nIn 1688, James II of England was deposed by his daughter, Mary, and her husband, William of Orange, in what came to be known as the \"Glorious Revolution\". From birth in 1650, William had reigned over five provinces of the Dutch Republic, and Mary had lived in the Netherlands with him after their marriage in 1677. William and Mary brought to their kingdoms a taste for Dutch furniture styles, as well as a number of Dutch furniture-makers. Although movement toward what would come to be called the William and Mary style had begun during the reign of Charles II of England, primarily due to the influence of his Portuguese-born queen, Catherine of Braganza, the style became defined and widely accepted during the reigns of William (d. 1702) and Mary (d. 1694), initially jointly and then after Mary's death, of William alone.\n\nThe William and Mary style was influenced by recent French furniture traditions, which in turn were influenced by Italian Baroque furniture designs. William and Mary style furniture emphasized unity, so that all elements contributed to an overall shape or look. It also featured high relief carving, strong curves, and elaborate woodturning. Despite these elements, the style was fairly squat, heavy-looking, and obviously sturdy. Straight lines are common. Paint, stains, or different kind of wood were used to create contrasting colors, which was another element of this style. Japanning, a technique of varnishing which was very popular at the time, was also used on this furniture design. For chairs, woven cane seats and heavily-scrolled backs predominated. Toward the end of the style, cane-woven seats and backs had given way to leather, and straight or slightly angled backs had given way to serpentine forms.\n\nOther decorative arts such as architecture, ceramics, silver, and textiles could also feature elements of the William and Mary style. The design movement had an extremely positive impact on the craftsmanship and quality of British furniture.\n\nThe William and Mary style was a transitional style between Mannerist and Queen Anne furniture. The William and Mary style was very popular in Britain from 1700 to 1725, and in America until about 1735. It was largely supplanted in both nations by Queen Anne style furniture.\n\nDaniel Marot, a French Huguenot, was employed by King William and Queen Mary to design furniture for them, and became deeply influential on English, Scottish, and Welsh furniture during this period. Dutch furniture craftsman Gerrit Jensen was appointed royal Cabinet Maker to the king and queen, and a great many works of his design were sold to wealthy British citizens of the day.\n\nIn Britain, case furniture in the William and Mary style tended to feature simple flat surfaces but exquisitely carved trim. Provincial furniture-makers in Britain moved away from the woven cane seat, and developed the leather-covered wooden seat as a vernacular design. Split spindles also came into use, first rurally and then urbanly.\n\nThe daybed was developed in Britain as part of the William and Mary style. So, too, was the writing desk, which was an adaptation of the bureau-cabinet.\n\nAmerican craftsmen working in the William and Mary style favored a tapered scroll foot for their designs. Walnut and, to a lesser extent, maple were the preferred woods, with walnut burl veneers and \"ebonization\" (black japanning) common.\n\nOver time, American forms of William and Mary furniture became simplified. Although the Baroque influence was still seen in the crests, feet, and scrolls, other elements and the overall look of pieces began to shed this influence in favor of plain but strong curves. American chairmakers began using woven cane in the splats of chairs as well. For armchairs, American designers favored seats and splats covered in leather, attached with brass nails. In parts of America like New York and New Jersey, which had a heavy Dutch cultural influence, the \"kast\" became popular. The \"kast\" was of Dutch origin, and featured a large drawer in the base unit. Atop the base were shelves concealed behind one or two heavy doors. An elaborate cornice usually ran along the upper edges. Influenced by the William and Mary style, the American \"kast\" featured removable feet, simplified the cornice, and eliminated the intricate inlays favored by the Dutch.\n\nThe \"Boston chair\" became one of the best-known examples of a William and Mary style chair made in America. This spoon-back chair with leather-covered seat and splat featured turned front legs and a turned stretcher between them. The side and rear stretcher as well as the rear legs, however, were undecorated straight lines. The corners of the frame around the splat were usually rounded down (although not turned), and the crest was a simplified geometric or curving design. They were usually painted black or red. Made primarily in Boston, Massachusetts, these chairs were manufactured in large numbers and very popular in America. They were also widely exported to Britain. Benches and settees manufactured in America were less influenced by the William and Mary style. Panels, developed in the 1600s, were used for the seat, back, and (where used) arms, with trim and legs reflecting the new style. Leather seats were, however, sometimes added.\n\nAnother innovation was the highboy. Essentially two chests of drawers, the lower slightly larger than the upper, American highboys often featured Solomonic or trumpet-shaped legs. It was somewhat common for the faces of the drawers to have a walnut burl veneer.\n\nThe William and Mary style lasted past the mid-1700s in rural America, often incorporating both Mannerist and Queen Anne styles. Slats began to be used in backs, and yoke-shaped crests became common.\n\nThe William and Mary style has long been overshadowed in both the United Kingdom and United States by the far more popular styles which came after it. Few reproductions of the furniture may be found today. However, numerous examples of William and Mary style furniture can still widely be found in British rural homes.\n\n"}
