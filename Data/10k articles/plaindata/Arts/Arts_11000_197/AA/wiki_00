{"id": "5924119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5924119", "title": "A Teenage Opera", "text": "A Teenage Opera\n\nA Teenage Opera is a musical project from the 1960s and was the creation of record producer Mark Wirtz.\n\nAccording to Wirtz, he had been working on an idea for a rock opera since January 1966, when he was experimenting in his London studio and produced a piece of music entitled \"A Touch of Velvet – A Sting of Brass\", under the name of \"Mood Mosaic\". Following a string of successful hits, he was asked to join EMI as an in-house record producer and he accepted, starting in January 1967. He had already seen Pink Floyd start their career and he personally recommended them to be signed but thought the task of producing them would be better left to fellow producer Norman Smith. Wirtz decided to work with another band he had enjoyed, The In Crowd, who soon changed their name to Tomorrow. According to Wirtz, he dreamed up the idea of Grocer Jack soon after being contracted to EMI and in February 1967 shared the idea with his engineer Geoff Emerick, who agreed to work on it. They decided to call it \"Excerpt from A Teenage Opera\", to imply there was more to come and the recording was produced as part of the Mood Mosaic project. The basic concept of \"A Teenage Opera\" was a series of sketches featuring different characters who lived in a fantasy village. These stories were to be told by a young man to a young girl. Wirtz intended the final project to be animated and later compared it to the \"Yellow Submarine\" by The Beatles. Wirtz used members of \"Tomorrow\" to produce the first recording.\n\nThe first song written was the story of Grocer Jack, the local grocer who was taken for granted until he died. Wirtz took an unused backing track from an old recording of his, a song called \"Love Will Always Find A Way\" and Steve Howe was asked to overdub the guitar. Wirtz had the character of Jack in his imagination but asked Keith West to write the lyrics for it. After West heard the music, he wrote the lyrics straightaway. Soon after, the single was recorded at Abbey Road Studios. The engineer, Geoff Emerick, who was working with The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album at the time, recorded the song in \"true stereo\", a rarity at the time, with all the latest technology that was available. The song itself featured the \"Opera\" trademark, the children's chorus, with singers from Corona Stage School.\n\nGrocer Jack (Excerpt from A Teenage Opera) was released on 28 July 1967 and was an instant hit. It was played continuously throughout the summer, later known as the Summer of Love and was helped into its number 2 spot by being played on pirate radio stations, particularly Radio London and Radio Caroline. It was also featured on the very first broadcast of Radio 1 on 30 September 1967. It was only kept off the number 1 spot by Engelbert Humperdinck's The Last Waltz and the enormous success of Grocer Jack got the media's attention. Rumours began circulating about the rest of the project; according to one source, the entire project had been completed by September and there was talk of a musical starring Cliff Richard. Another single was produced in October, \"Sam,\" with West on vocals and Howe on guitar again. However, it did not get above 38 in the chart. Despite Radio 1 DJ Tony Blackburn helping promote it and Wirtz creating a special edited airplay version, the song was a failure, as it simply did not have nearly as much publicity as Grocer Jack did and was played a lot less. The fact many of the pirate stations had been shut down did not help things either. Following this, West made the decision to leave the project. He found it difficult to work between two very different projects and it confused fans. Wirtz meanwhile completed \"(He's Our Dear Old) Weatherman\", which had started out as \"The Paranoiac Woodcutter\". It was the most complex recording so far, containing more than 100 different sounds. However, like \"Sam\", it received very little airplay, due to Radio 1's seeming inability to play it. Wirtz had already begun working on Tomorrow's album and recorded a remake of \"Hallucinations\" for single release. It was renamed to \"Mr Rainbow\". Wirtz produced this song, sung by Steve Flynn in August 1967. Wirtz took another track from the album, \"Shy Boy\" and it was re-recorded by Kippington Lodge. These two songs eventually ended up on the final album released in 1996.\n\n\"Uncut\" asserted in April 2004 that \"Sam\" was a major influence on Pete Townshend's \"Tommy\".\n\nWirtz composed a range of material around this time, releasing it under a series of pseudonyms. Much of the music produced in late 1967 became part of the project and was released on the 1996 album. There were two particular recordings that did not survive, \"The Sad Story Of Simon And His Bugle\" and \"Two's Company, Three Thousand's A Crowd\". The latter was a musical comedy, with the voices of Tim Rice and Samantha Jones. In January 1968 Wirtz married Ross Hannaman and subsequently recorded many songs co-written with her. The track \"Barefoot and Tiptoe\" was one of their collaborations and featured her voice, as well as the Band of the Irish Guards. It was released as by \"The Sweetshop\" but sales were poor. Wirtz was forced to shelve the project and concentrated on \"Tomorrow\", whose album was released in February 1968. However, many songs were released over the years that were intended for the project, for example \"Dream Dream Dream\", performed by Wirtz but credited as Zion De Gallier. An album released in Germany in 1968 contained what was the basis for the \"Theme from a Teenage Opera\".\n\nGrocer Jack was parodied in the mid 1970s on a flexi-disk (Private Eye recordings) released by the satirical magazine \"Private Eye\". The words were changed to \"Grocer Heath, Grocer Heath, cover up those awful teeth\", referring to the Prime Minister, Edward Heath.\n\nIn 1996 a CD was released by Wirtz with every track recorded over the years intended for use in \"A Teenage Opera\". Some of the songs (notably the two singles) were remixed in stereo.\n\nThe tracks are as follows:\n\n\nIn July 2017 it was announced that a stage show for 'A Teenage Opera' has been written, with script and additional lyrics by Pete Gallagher and featuring the songs of Wirtz and West, produced by Youth Music Theatre UK. Its world premiere would be held at South Hill Park arts centre in Bracknell on 11 August, with the hope of transferring the production to London.\n\n"}

After five years of fundraising and planning, the Cinematheque launched its first series of screenings in 1987. It presents festivals and retrospectives that screen the best of worldwide cinema, video, and television from the past and present, ranging from the classics to the outer frontiers of the art form. In addition to presenting and celebrating all aspects of the moving picture on the big screen, the Cinematheque also provides a forum where film lovers and students can hear the world's leading filmmakers, actors, writers, editors, cinematographers, and others discussing their craft.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1998, the Cinematheque presented its programs at a variety of venues, including the Directors Guild of America theater and the Raleigh Studios complex in Hollywood. In December 1998, it opened its own permanent home at the Egyptian in Hollywood, and in 2004 added a second theater, the Aero, in Santa Monica. It now presents festivals, retrospectives, and assorted programs at these two theaters.\n\nGrauman's Egyptian Theatre is the Hollywood movie palace built in 1922 by showman Sid Grauman (four years prior to opening his Chinese Theatre). It was the location of Hollywood's first-ever movie premiere in 1922. In 1998, the American Cinematheque completed a major $12.8 million renovation that restored the theater's exterior to its original form, and added new film, video, and audio technology.\n\nThe Aero Theatre in Santa Monica is a 1940 landmark movie theater that has also been renovated by the Cinametheque.\n\nAmong the Cinematheque's many annual festivals, it has become well known for presenting the Mods & Rockers Festival of rock-culture films first presented in 1999. The 2006 festival was a six-week retrospective the \"Los Angeles Times\" noted was the largest-ever festival of rock-music films presented in the USA.\n\nIn addition to its year-round programs, the organization presents the prestigious American Cinematheque Award annually to a filmmaker in recognition of contributions to the art form. In the 20 years since the award's inception, many major filmmakers have been honored, including directors such as Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, and Rob Reiner, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and actors including Eddie Murphy, Bette Midler, Mel Gibson, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Denzel Washington, and Jodie Foster.\n\nAmerican Cinematheque's distribution arm was set up in 1999 as Vitagraph Films.\n\nThe organization is governed by a board of directors and a board of trustees. The two boards include many prominent leaders in the entertainment industry, including directors and producers such as Sydney Pollack, Martin Scorsese, Mike Nichols, Francis Coppola, William Friedkin, Melvin Van Peebles, Brian Grazer, Joe Dante, Paula Wagner, and Steve Tisch. Other prominent board members include actors Candice Bergen and Goldie Hawn; studio chief Mike Medavoy; journalist Peter Bart (editor in chief of \"Variety\"); and talent agent Rick Nicita (co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency).\n\n"}

It is based on the 1991 novel \"Angie, I Says\" by Avra Wing, which was a \"New York Times\" Notable Book of 1991.\n\nAngie (Geena Davis) is an office worker who lives in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, New York and dreams of a better life. After learning that she is pregnant by her boyfriend Vinnie (James Gandolfini), she decides that she will have the baby, but not Vinnie as a husband.\n\nThis turns the entire neighborhood upside down and starts her on a journey of self-discovery, including a love affair with a man named Noel (Stephen Rea) who she meets at an art museum. Even her best friend Tina (Aida Turturro) has trouble understanding her.\n\n\n20th Century Fox films head Joe Roth, production president Roger Birnbaum and producer Larry Brezner had “Angie, I Says” under development. Todd Graff had written the screenplay for Madonna. The adaptation was place into turnaround. Roth and Birnbaum had left for an independent label at Disney, Caravan Pictures, and were able to get the “Angie, I Says” adaptation moved over. With scheduling conflicts with her role in Abel Ferrara’s movie \"Dangerous Game\", which is also produced by her company, Maverick, she dropped out of then Jonathan Kaplan-directed movie. Madonna had wanted them to push back production on the film, but give that it was a winter story Caravan want to film it in winter then debut in winter. She bowed out as they additional had issue with her lack of acting experience. The lead role was then offered to Geena Davis.\n\nThe film opened to mixed reviews and was a box office bomb. In addition, Geena Davis, who won an Oscar six years before for \"The Accidental Tourist\" received mixed to negative reviews. Critics felt she could have been better in this movie or another set in Brooklyn. The film was famous for introducing three actors who would star on the TV show \"The Sopranos\": James Gandolfini, Aida Turturro, and Michael Rispoli.\n\n\n"}

It is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and since 2005 has collaborated with its sister association ART \"for The\" World Europa, based in Milan, Italy. In 1995, Adelina von Fürstenberg founded ART \"for The\" World within \"Dialogues de Paix\" (Dialogues of Peace), an international contemporary art exhibition which she curated on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.\n\nART \"for The\" World is inspired by Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaims creative activity as an essential part of people's well-being (\"Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts...\"). Its mission is to create, through the universal language of art, a meaningful and enduring dialogue among people and cultures in order to encourage tolerance and solidarity and to foster education as a human right.\n\nART \"for The\" World works in close collaboration with the artists' community and with the institutions that defend and promote the principles of human rights: the United Nations, the World Health Organization (WHO), the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the European Parliament. \n\nIt presents its projects in sites which do not belong to the traditional contemporary art circuit, such as ancient monuments, monasteries, medersas, public buildings, schools, islands, parks, stadium and other open spaces. Art \"for The\" World organises exhibitions, lectures, conferences, publishes books and produces films.\n\nAmong its main exhibitions, in 1997 Art \"for The\" World organised \"Meditations\", at Medersa Ibn Youssef, Marrakech, Morocco with a large number of international artists, such as Alighiero e Boetti, Shirazeh Houshiary, Ilya Kabakov, Kacimi, Anish Kapoor, Rachid Koraichi, Sol LeWitt, Maria Carmen Perlingeiro, and Chen Zhen.\nIn 1998, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the World Health Organization, it curated the international travelling exhibition \"The Edge of Awareness\", in Geneva, New York, São Paulo, New Delhi and Milan.\nIn 2000, for the 50th anniversary of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR), AfTW created the project \"Playgrounds and Toys\" for refugee children. Since then, it has built playgrounds designed by artists in India, Armenia, and the United Kingdom. Fabrice Gygi, Fabiana de Barros, Joseph Kosuth, Andreas Angelikakis and Eleni Kostika were among the invited artists and architects.\n\nIn 2001, within the Program for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination of the United Nations, AfTW promoted \"The Overexcited Body\", an international itinerant art exhibition on the role of sport in the contemporary world in Geneva, Milan and São Paulo, with artists such as Sylvie Fleury, Miltos Manetas, Tracey Moffatt, Hélio Oiticica, and Nam June Paik.\n\nIn 2005-2007, for the 10th anniversary of the Beijing Women Convention, AfTW organised \"Woman Women\", an international touring exhibition, in Geneva, Florence and São Paulo with artworks by Marina Abramović, Shirin Neshat, Wang Du, Ghada Amer, and Berlinde De Bruyckere.\n\nIn 2007-2010 AfTW organized the large itinerant exhibition on Indian art \"Urban Manners. 15 Contemporary Artists from India\", featuring works by internationally well-known Indian artists such as Sheba Chhachhi, Atul Dodiya, Bharti Kher, Subodh Gupta, Ranbir Kaleka, Jitish Kallat, Raghubir Singh, and Vivan Sundaram. The exhibition was presented in Milan and São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nIn 2010 in the contest of the event \"Vivere Sani Vivere Bene\" (Live Healthy, Live Well), the Fondazione Zoé/Zambon Group invited AfTW to organize an exhibition focused on the theme of health and in particular on breath, as an ideal prosecution of the first collaboration for the exhibition \"The Edge of Awareness\" in 1998 . The exhibition \"Respiro/Breath\" was presented in various spaces and venues around the city of Vicenza, featuring audio and video installations by Vito Acconci, and Nikos Navridis, and billboards by Stefano Arienti, Alfredo Jaar, Ilya Kabakov, Sol LeWitt, and Pat Steir.\n\nIn 2011-2012 AfTW organized \"The Mediterranean Approach\", an itinerant exhibition under the auspices of the Cultural Council of the Union pour la Méditerranée (UPM) and Marseille Provence 2013, Cultural Capital of Europe. Aiming to emphasize differences as well as similarities as part of the underlying deep identity connecting all Mediterranean peoples, the exhibition was presented at Palazzo Zenobio in Venice (2011), during the Venice Biennale, in Marseille at the mac - Museum of Contemporary Art (2012), and will tour to SESC Pinheiros in São Paulo (Brazil) during the São Paulo Biennal in September 2012, in collaboration with the Regional Direction of SESC São Paulo.\n\nSince 2008, AfTW has been producing and distributing film projects related to the main human, cultural and social issues. In 2008, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, AfTW produced \"Stories on Human Rights\", a long feature film inspired by the UDHR and composed by a series of short movies directed by 22 video artists (including Marina Abramović, Pipilotti Rist, and Runa Islam) and independent filmmakers from all over the world (including Sergei Bodrov, Hany Abu Assad, Abderrhamane Sissako, and Zang-Ke Jia). The film was screened in more than 70 film festivals and events during 2009-2010.\n\nIn 2010-2011 AfTW produced the new series of seven short films \"THEN AND NOW Beyond Borders and Differences\", under the auspices of the UN Alliance of Civilizations and the Council of Europe. Inspired by article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \"Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion\", the omnibus film involves seven independent well known filmmakers from five continents promoting tolerance by creating films and stories highlighting the long-standing historical, spiritual and cultural links across cultures and beliefs. The filmmakers were Tata Amaral (Brazil), Fanny Ardant (France), Hüseyin Karabey (Turkey), Masbedo (Italy), Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso), Jafar Panahi (Iran), and Robert Wilson (US). A first series of five short movies was screened in a world première at the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro on the occasion of the 3rd Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations, while the short movie \"The Accordion\" by Jafar Panahi was presented in a world première at Venice Days during the Venice International Film Festival in September 2010. The short \"Chimères Absentes\" by Fanny Ardant was premiered at the Rome Film Festival in October 2010.

{"id": "26716006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26716006", "title": "Arts in Second Life", "text": "Arts in Second Life\n\nArts in \"Second Life\" is an artistic area of a 3D social network (called \"Second Life\") that has served, since 2003, as a platform for various artistic pursuits and exhibitions. SL Photography is one of the most popular forms of artistic expression with images known as \"snapshots\" produced while travelling through \"Second Life\"s virtual environment. Many of these snapshots are displayed through various mediums that include Art Galleries, Machinima websites and Second Life Magazines.\n\nSecond Life has created an environment where artists can display their works to an audience across the world. This has created an entire artistic culture where many residents display art in the museums, galleries and homes they can buy or build using Second Life's powerful tools. Gallery openings even allow art patrons to \"meet\" and socialize with exhibiting artists and has even led to many real life sales.\n\nNumerous art gallery simulations (called \"sims\") abound in Second Life. Among the more popular galleries are the Sisse Singhs Art Gallery, the Windlight art Gallery and the Horus Art Gallery. Among the most notable of these was the art gallery sim Cetus Gallery District, the world's first virtual online urban arts district. Cetus was modeled on real world analogs such as New York's Chelsea gallery district as a mixed-use arts community of virtual galleries, offices, loft apartments, and coffee houses. Its many tenant-run businesses featured weekly live music performances, gallery openings, and literary events such as the virtual book launch for \"Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human,\" by Tom Boellstorf (Princeton University Press; 2008). Cetus was chosen Best Cultural Site in Second Life in 2007, and its creator avatar Xander Ruttan (real world arts professional Aaron Collins of California), was among the most influential art world avatars in SL. Cetus resulted in many ongoing collaborative efforts among the SL community of artists, designers, writers, and virtual builders from across the real and virtual worlds. (Cetus was later bought by virtual artist DB Bailey and converted into a personal art project).\n\nThe modeling tools from \"Second Life\" allow the artists also to create new forms of art that in many ways are not possible in real life due to physical constraints or high associated costs. The virtual arts are visible in over 2050 \"museums\" (according to SL's own search engine).\n\nIn 2008 Haydn Shaughnessy, real life gallerist, along with his wife Roos Demol hired a real life architect, New York based, Benn Dunkley to design a gallery in Second Life. Dunkleys goal was to design an interactive gallery with art in mind in a virtual world. \"Ten Cubed\" is a radical departure in art exhibition, a futuristically designed gallery showcasing art in a unique setting. On January 31, 2008, \"Ten Cubed\" was launched. \nFor its inaugural exhibition, \"Crossing the Void II\", owner and curator Shaughnessy selected five artists working in and with modern technologies. These artists included Chris Ashley based in Oakland, California, Jon Coffelt based in New York, New York, Claire Keating based in Cork, Ireland, Scott Kildall based in San Francisco, California and Nathaniel Stern originally based in New York, New York now in Dublin, Ireland. Real life as well as Second Life editions are available from the gallery.\n\nThe virtual creations from the metaverse are disclosed in real life by initiatives such as Fabjectory (statuettes) and Secondlife-Art.com (oil paintings).\n\nIn April 2007 the huge gallery called crossworlds gallery opened its doors in Secondlife; therefore, the aim was to create an open space for art in virtual worlds. Also in 2007, artists Adam Nash, Christopher Dodds and Justin Clemens won a A$20,000 Second Life Artists in Residence grant from the Australia Council for the Arts. Their \"Babelswarm\" installation was launched in Second Life and The Lismore Regional Gallery in NSW, Australia on April 11, 2008 by Australia Council Chairman James Strong.\nIn 2008, the French Artist Fred Forest had entered the virtual world of Second Life to show his art project for the first time in his country. He inaugurated his \"Experimental Center of the Territory of M2\" (\"Centre expérimental du terrioire du M2\"), where he invited politicians to discuss about sustainable development and digital identity card ( Capucine.net). In another art project, he discussed about art institutions in France in his action called \"l'art de la corrida\".\n\nLive music performances in \"Second Life\" takes place in three distinctly different ways;\n\nLinden Lab added an Event Category \"Live Music\" in March 2006 to accommodate the increasing number of scheduled events. By the beginning of 2008, scheduled live music performance events in \"Second Life\" spanned every musical genre, and included hundreds of live musicians and DJs who perform on a regular basis. A typical day in \"Second Life\" will feature dozens of live music performances.\n\nIn 2008 the UK act Redzone announced they would release their new live album only via Second Life.\n\nRedzone also began choreographing and synchronising their performances via MIDI in October 2008.\n\nMany amateur performers start their music careers in Second Life by performing at virtual karaoke bars or Open Mic, then progress to performing for \"pay\", or Linden dollars, in-world.\n\n\"Second Life\" is popular for filming with machinima. Virtual worlds can contain all aspects of real world filming techniques as well as many more not possible in the real world. It is far easier to create 3D objects in \"Second Life\" and film them than create them from 'scratch' using traditional CGI software.\nThere are many machinima and performing arts groups that are active in \"Second Life\" and which participate in creative events such as the annual 48 Hour Film Project. There are also several machinima groups that actively promote the works of Second Life artists such as Machinima Mondays, Rezzed TV, MAGE Magazine and the Machinima Artist's guild.\n\nLive theater is presented in \"Second Life\". The SL Shakespeare Company performed an act from \"Hamlet\" live in February 2008. In 2009, the company produced scenes from \"Twelfth Night\".\n\nIn 2007 Johannes von Matuschka and Daniel Michelis developed Wunderland, an interactive SL theatre play at Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz in Berlin, Germany.\n\nIn 2007, HBO hosted a comedy festival in \"Second Life,\" using live streaming audio. In March 2009, SL residents staged a two-day Virtually Funny Comedy Festival to \"help build awareness for Comic Relief, Red Nose Day 2009 and of course, comedy in Second Life.\"\n\nIn December 2008, The Learning Experience, a not-for-profit virtual education campus in Second Life, staged its first live theater events with the production of two short plays, \"A Matter of Husbands\" by Ferenc Molnár and \"Porcelain and Pink\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. In 2009, the TLE theater company began producing full-length plays in Second Life, starting with \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" by Oscar Wilde in February, and followed by \"Candida\" by George Bernard Shaw in April.\n\nIn 2008 The Avatar Repertory Theater company was set up. This is another Theatre company that works within SL.\n\nIn 2009 the Department of Drama at the University of Calgary mounted four short productions in the New Media Consortium theater as part of a class in performance in non-traditional spaces. These plays were (a) \"Guppies\" (by Clem Martini) in March (b) The Chocolate Affair (by Stephanie Alison Walker); (c) Kingdom of the Spider (by Nick Zagone); (d) The Boy Who Cried Genie (by D. M. Bocaz-Larson).\n\nIn 2011/12, an all-furry performing arts troupe, Ravenswood Theatricals, was launched at their own venue with successful, non-commercial virtual renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"The Phantom of the Opera\", the latter of which was received with glowing reviews. A number of further productions of established real-life pieces such as \"Les Misérables\", \"Tanz der Vampire\", \"Sunset Boulevard\", and \"Into the Woods\" are reportedly planned, as well as a gala presentation of various musical numbers from upcoming productions.\n\nVirtual dance has been elevated in Second Life.\n\nBallet Pixelle® (formerly Second Life Ballet) was the first performing ballet company in Second Life (2006). Ballet Pixelle®, with founder and artistic director Inarra Saarinen, produces all original animations, choreography, and music composed specifically for each ballet. All dance is done as art, not automation, with the dancers actually dancing with each other and the music—there is no artificial synchronization involved.\n\nLa Performance. started in May 2008 with live dance shows. Two shows are produced in a year, in March/April/May 2010 modern ballet show 'BACK TO BLACK' with music by Queen (band), Francisco de la Torre, Metallica, Amy Winehouse, Paula Cole, Richard Wagner, Louis Armstrong, Suzi Quatro. October/November/December 2010: 'POLYAMOUR': this modern ballet show was danced live to a live concert by REIS and Aldo Brizzi (vocals and electronics). March/April/May 2011: 'ROMANCE'. November/December 2011/January 2012: 'BORN'. March/April/May 2012: 'INSENSATEZ'.\n\nThere have been several books written about experiences in \"Second Life\". \"Second Life Love\" is example of such a book. It is a dialog between Per Olsen en Li Gang Qin about their partnership in Second Life. The authors have never seen each other in real life.\n\nOther books include \"Second Life For Dummies\" by Sarah Robbins and Mark Bell, which was published in 2008 and provides assistance for new users of the virtual world, including basics, how to meet people, ideas for activities and places to visit, including how to access real life education in \"Second Life\".\n\nAnnabeth Robinson, or AngryBeth Shortbread, creates online performances or installations using Second Life. For example, Robinson contributed to the 'Kritical Works in SL' project in 2008 to create a sound installation called \"Ping Space\". This was a piece of work that involved two cubes reverberating sound from each other which would only happen when one cube was 300 ft above the other. Other such work can be found at the Annabeth Robinson page.\n\nGarrett Lynch is an Irish new media artist working with networked technologies in a variety of forms including online art, installation, performance and writing. Since 2008 he has created a series of installation and performance works dealing with ideas of identity and place as they relate to networked spaces. In these works Lynch explores the \"real\" and the \"virtual\" through the transposing of his own identity to virtual worlds such as Second Life without any attempt to masquerade or imagine a new identity. This process involves the use of his real name for his \"representation\" or avatar, word play that references his names origins as both real and Irish and the use of a sandwich board prop stating this that is worn continuously.\n\nIn 2010/2011 he was artist in residence at HUMlab, Yoshikaze Up-in-the-Air Residency. Outcomes of the residence have since been published as an artists book and an article in Metaverse Creativity (Volume 2, Number 2). Currently Lynch has and is currently performing with a custom-built scale reproduction of his Second Life \"representations\" sandwich board. This has been worn at a number of exhibitions and performances.\n\nGleman Jun is an Italian artist in Second Life. In the dynamic effects of colors, lights and transparencies, he expresses his creativity in a constantly evolving and transforming himself. In his case, a work of art is composed of two different elements:\nvision and technique. \"Vision\" is the image that passes through his mind suddenly. \"Technique\" is the experience that allows the memory to translate the vision into a \"real\" and shareable object.\n\nSecond Front is the first performance art group of Second Life. Founded in 2006, its current seven-member troupe includes Gazira Babeli (Italy), Yael Gilks (London), Bibbe Hansen (New York), Doug Jarvis (Victoria), Scott Kildall (San Francisco), Patrick Lichty (Chicago) and Liz Solo (St. Johns).\n\nSecond Front members collaborate remotely and their performances have been shown live in New York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Brussels, Berlin, Vancouver and many other cities. The group has been written about in publications including ArtForum, Art in America, Realtime Arts (Australia), Exibart (Italy) and Digital Art, (Second Edition) by Christiane Paul (curator).\n\nSL Art is one of the most popular art groups in Second Life. Its goal is to recognize the art in virtual worlds at the same level of visual art in real life. There are several second Life publications that work to promote Second Life Art, including Windlight Magazine, the SL Newser, and the SL Enquirer.\n"}

Located on the southeast corner of 23rd Street and Sixth Avenue, Booth's Theatre opened on February 3, 1869. \n\nThe Theatre featured a grand vestibule with Italian marble floors and a large statue of Edwin Booth's father, the Shakespearean actor, Junius Brutus Booth by the sculptor Thomas Ridgeway Gould. The auditorium was similarly elaborate in its decor, and featured a large chandelier, as well as a stage that incorporated the most modern machinery in use at the time, such as hydraulic rams to raise and lower scenery, and stage lights that could be completely extinguished during the performance, a first in the United States.\n\nDespite the appearances by important talent of the times, Booth could not make the Theatre a financially viable enterprise. It was sold in December 1881, and was converted into McCreepy & Co. department store until 1965, when it was demolished to make room for a parking lot.\n\nIn 1869, Edwin Booth, then one of the world's most distinguished stage tragedians and arguably America's greatest Hamlet, opened his theatre, Booth's Theatre, in Manhattan on the southeast corner of 23rd Street and Sixth Avenue. \n\nCentral to the identity of Booth's theatre was the stage background of Edwin Booth, who belonged to the Booth Family dynasty, which ruled the American stage in the 19th century. It was actually touring with his father, Junius Brutus Booth, that gave Edwin his first break, first appearing as Tressel in Richard II in Boston in 1849. After his father's death in 1852 Booth toured internationally, visiting Australia and Hawaii and briefly settling in California before returning to East Coast. Edwin is perhaps best known for his \"hundred nights of Hamlet\" in which he played Hamlet for 101 consecutive performances, a record held until 1922. Booth is also known for his relationship with his infamous brother, John Wilkes, who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln. After the tragedy, Edwin publicly disowned his brother. \n\nBooth had been drawn to the idea of erecting his own theatre, particularly after he purchased the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia. Plans overtook Booth when a tragic fire of 1867 consumed The Winter Garden Theatre - Booth's usual performing home in New York - and with it much of Booth's personal wardrobe. The new theatre was to be one of the finest of its time, called in the press \"A fitting temple for the presentation of Shakspearean drama.\"\n\nBooth's Theatre remained Booth's new performing home for several years, during which time Booth and his elder brother Junius Brutus Booth, Jr., produced productions of the classics and hosted guest artists, such as Joseph Jefferson in his popular \"Rip Van Winkle\". Finally, due in part to bad management, Booth lost the theatre to bankruptcy in 1874, and \"never again participated in theatrical management.\" In 1883 the theatre was converted into a department store, which was demolished in 1965. Presently, the land is occupied by a Best Buy electronics store.\n\nOn April 8, 1868, after the removal of several old structures and blasting out an unexpected \"stone ledge\" at the corner of Twenty Third and Sixth Avenue, Edwin Booth, after \"Masonic observances\", laid the cornerstone for his new theatre. Designed by the architectural firm of Renwick and Sands the theatre was made of granite in the Second Empire style, with an impressive front, iron-trimmed facing north on Twenty Third Street of one hundred and fifty feet in length. An additional wing extending to Sixth Avenue to the west, housed construction shops, studios and additional rooms- one which was reserved for Edwin Booth. North to south, the theatre was one hundred feet, and stood at a height of one hundred and twenty feet, topped with a mansard roof, including three towers. Under the side walk along Twenty Third Street was the carpenter's shop, as well as a boiler-room with a steam engine used to heat the theatre through extensive hot-air pipes. The entire theatre was heated and cooled with forced air.\n\nSeveral arched doors led to a grand vestibule, where a large statue of Edwin Booth's father, the great Shakespearean actor, Junius Brutus Booth, by the sculptor Thomas Ridgeway Gould, greeted the audience. The floor was Italian marble, the ceiling was covered with frescoes. \n\nIn the theatre, a large chandelier, lit by gas-jets ignited by electricity, hung above the auditorium. Marble pillars, adorned with statues, surrounded the box seats. In the center, above the proscenium arch stood a statue of Shakespeare by the Italian sculptor Signor G. Turini. Portrait busts of David Garrick, Edmund Kean and other great actors adorned the proscenium arch.\n\nThe stage itself was equipped with the most modern stage machinery then in use. The deck of the stage had double-floors. Two spiral staircases at the rear corners of the stage led to four fly galleries. Scenery was raised and lowered by hydraulic rams under the stage.\n\nThese were but some of the innovations in the theatre that made the theatre an architectural marvel in New York. Others included one of New York's first sprinkler systems for fire prevention, and, backstage, sets of hydraulic rams were used to raise moving bridges and platforms to change scenery. \n\nIn addition, stage lights - for the first time in America - could be completely extinguished both in the auditorium and on the stage during the performance through the use of an electric spark ignition system. This facilitated being able to plunge the entire theatre - both stage and auditorium - into complete darkness during a performance of Booth's Hamlet.\n\nBooth's Theatre, modeled after the finest theatres of Europe, and using American inventiveness, was a marvel of technology and a palace of theatrical pleasure.\n\nBooth chose to open his new theatre with a sumptuous production of William Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", starring leading actress Mary F. McVicker as Juliet and Booth as Romeo, supported by a \"full and efficient company\" of actors (see program, right). The program also noted that \"The tragedy will be produced in strict accordance with historical propriety, in every respect, following closely the text of Shakespeare\".\n\nOpening night was called \"a great event in theatrical circles\" by the \"New York Times.\" Seats for the opening performance were sold at public auction for a total of $10,000.\n\nThe popular run of \"Romeo and Juliet\" lasted ten weeks, earning nearly sixty thousand dollars, then considered an exceptional triumph. Two years before Booth had played Hamlet to McVicker's Ophelia at the famous McVicker's Theatre in Chicago, leading to his invitation for her to play opposite Booth in New York. McVicker's performance at Booth's Theatre marked her New York stage debut. That same season she played Desdemona to Booth's Othello at Booth's Theatre, and, on May 29, 1869, made her farewell performance in that role. A little over a week later, Booth married McVicker, and then returned to acting at his theatre.\n\nFor five years—called \"five brilliant but disastrous seasons\" in the \"New York Times\"—Edwin Booth struggled to make his theatre a profitable enterprise, but it was not to be. Despite his performing on the stage, and booking some of the leading talent at Booth's Theatre, such as his friend Joseph Jefferson, it was not possible to pay the bills. As William Winter, Booth's friend and eventual biographer wrote:\n\nTry as he might, Booth could not make his theatre into a viable business enterprise. Once again he turned to touring with his successful productions of \"Hamlet\", \"Othello\", and \"Richelieu\", to raise funds he sent back to New York, but nothing could produce enough money to keep the doors of Booth's Theatre open. He relied on the advice and \"experience of others\" to run the theatre, but it was not in his nature. The press, in writing of Booth's departure from managing his own theatre, suggested that \"it is true that the frames have sometimes outshone the pictures,\" meaning that the spectacle of lavish sets and costumes at times upstaged the performances of the actors in Booth's productions, especially, apparently, the performances of the women. Even when shows were financial successes, such as the revival of the popular \"The Little Detective\" and the hit drama \"Little Nell and the Marchioness\" both starring the renowned Charlotte Crabtree in 1871, the theatre was still in debt. Finally, in 1874, only five years after the triumphant opening \"Romeo and Juliet\", Booth lost the theatre to bankruptcy, and \"never again participated in theatrical management\".\n\nAfter being sold by Booth, the theatre was owned by several different managers, including the theatrical impresarios Augustin Daly and Dion Boucicault.\n\nDespite the appearances by important talent of the times, such as Dion Boucicault Jr., who made his stage début in his father's play, \"Louis XI\", Joseph Jefferson as Rip Van Winkle, Polish born actress Helena Modjeska as Juliet, and the French-born \"devine Sarah\" - Sarah Bernhardt - who appeared in her acclaimed production of \"Adrienne Lecouveur\" in 1881, and despite successful runs of comedies, such as Bronson Howard's smash hit \"Love in the Green Room\", and spectacular productions featuring lavish historical recreations such as Shakespeare's \"Henry V\" (see photo, left), the theatre could not sustain itself. In 1882 Oedipus Rex was performed there to a sold out audience which included Oscar Wilde, Robert Barnwell Roosevelt, his mistress Marion O'Shea Fortescue, the mother of Granville Roland Fortescue, and composer Joaquin Miller, but even such well regarded operas and elegant audiences couldn't revive the theater.\n\nBooth's Theatre ended as it began, with Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\". The last performance at Booth's Theatre was played by the famed actress Helena Modjeska, portraying the role of Juliet in \"Romeo and Juliet\" in 1883. The production was given as a benefit performance (as was common in the era), for Andrew Boyd, beloved janitor of the building - a fitting farewell, perhaps, to one of New York's great theatres. After the production closed, the building was turned into a large department store.\nOn December 31, 1881, a headline in the \"New York Times\" read:\n\nThe building lived on as the McCreepy & Co. department store, and was finally demolished in 1965 to make room for a parking lot.\n\nIn December 1878, Booth wrote an open letter in \"The Christian Union\", in which he observed:\n"}

The school is a part of the Faculty of the Arts at Tel Aviv University and is operated in collaboration with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (IPO). The school is named after Jewish philanthropist Joseph Buchmann from Frankfurt and conductor Zubin Mehta, Music Director of the IPO. Maestro Mehta is the honorary president of the school and conducts its symphony orchestra regularly in Israel and on tours abroad. The BMSM mission is to train elite young musicians in the realms of performance, composition and research in music and prepare them for professional careers in these fields. The BMSM's orchestral training program is an integral part of the school and aims to educate orchestral musicians to ensure the artistic future of the IPO and other orchestras in Israel.\n\nThe Buchmann-Mehta School of Music was founded in 2005 as a partnership between Tel-Aviv University, the largest and most comprehensive university in Israel, and the IPO, the country`s most prominent music institution. The school's foundation was made possible by the donation of Dr.hc Josef Buchmann and conductor Zubin Mehta, who has been actively involved in the school since its inception. The first head of the school and one of its founders was pianist and pedagogue Prof. Tomer Lev. In 2009 he was succeeded by conductor and bassoonist Prof. Zeev Dorman, who had served as the IPO's principal bassoon player as well as chairman of the orchestra's executive board for nearly 25 years. In August 2015 Prof. Lev resumed his post as head of the BMSM.\n\nAlthough inaugurated as late as 2005, the school's roots go back to 1945, when it was originally established as the Israel Academy of Music by senior members of the IPO, who had fled Europe on the brink of World War II. In 1966 it was merged into the newly formed Tel Aviv University and in 1972 became a cornerstone for the university's Yolanda and David Katz Faculty of the Arts.\nThe heads of the historical Academy were among the founding fathers of the music world in Israel: violist and composer Ödön Pártos, pianist and conductor Arie Vardi, composers Yehezkel Braun, Yitzhack Sadai and Joseph Dorfman, violinist Yair Kless and composers Ami Maayani and Noam Sheriff.\n\nThe school is currently composed of the performance department in its various instrumental tracks, the composition and conducting department, the musicology department and the orchestral training program of the IPO. The School is located in the Ramat-Aviv campus of TAU as a unit of the Katz Faculty of the Arts. The BMSM maintains a wide spectrum of performance ensembles, including a full symphony orchestra, an oratorio choir, a chamber choir, an opera ensemble, a contemporary music ensemble, a piano ensemble (MultiPiano) and some 50 other chamber ensembles. \n\nThe school building houses two concert halls (Clairmont Hall and Targ Hall) and a well-equipped recording studio. Some 200 concerts, lectures and master classes are held annually, many of these under the BMSM subscription concert series named after the late Yehiel Ben-Zvi, former Vice-President of Tel Aviv University. These events attract more than 2,000 regular subscribers a year as well as numerous visitors, making the BMSM one of the busiest music centers in the country.\n"}
{"id": "464779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=464779", "title": "Building material", "text": "Building material\n\nBuilding material is any material which is used for construction purposes. Many naturally occurring substances, such as clay, rocks, sand, and wood, even twigs and leaves, have been used to construct buildings. Apart from naturally occurring materials, many man-made products are in use, some more and some less synthetic. The manufacturing of building materials is an established industry in many countries and the use of these materials is typically segmented into specific specialty trades, such as carpentry, insulation, plumbing, and roofing work. They provide the make-up of and structures including homes.\n\nIn history there are trends in building materials from being natural to becoming more man-made and composite; biodegradable to imperishable; indigenous (local) to being transported globally; repairable to disposable; chosen for increased levels of fire-safety, and improved seismic resistance.. These trends tend to increase the \"initial\" and \"long term\" economic, ecological, energy, and social costs of building materials.\n\nInitial economic cost of building materials is the purchase price. This is often what governs decision making about what materials to use. Sometimes people take into consideration the energy savings or durability of the materials and see the value of paying a higher initial cost in return for a lower lifetime cost. For example, an asphalt shingle roof costs less than a metal roof to install, but the metal roof will last longer so the lifetime cost is less per year. Some materials may require more care than others, maintaining costs specific to some materials may also influence the final decision. Risks when considering lifetime cost of a material is if the building is damaged such as by fire or wind, or if the material is not as durable as advertised. The cost of materials should be taken into consideration to bear the risk to buy combustive materials to enlarge the lifetime. It is said that, 'if it must be done, it must be done well'.\n\nPollution costs can be macro and micro. The macro, environmental pollution of extraction industries building materials rely on such as mining, petroleum, and logging produce environmental damage at their source and in transportation of the raw materials, manufacturing, transportation of the products, retailing, and installation. An example of the micro aspect of pollution is the off-gassing of the building materials in the building or indoor air pollution. Red List building materials are materials found to be harmful. Also the carbon footprint, the total set of greenhouse gas emissions produced in the life of the material. A life-cycle analysis also includes the reuse, recycling, or disposal of construction waste. Two concepts in building which account for the ecological economics of building materials are green building and sustainable development.\n\nthe Initial energy costs include the amount of energy consumed to produce, deliver and install the material. The long term energy cost is the economic, ecological, and social costs of continuing to produce and deliver energy to the building for its use, maintenance, and eventual removal. The initial embodied energy of a structure is the energy consumed to extract, manufacture, deliver, install, the materials. The lifetime embodied energy continues to grow with the use, maintenance, and reuse/recycling/disposal of the building materials themselves \"and\" how the materials and design help minimize the life-time energy consumption of the structure.\n\nSocial costs are injury and health of the people producing and transporting the materials and potential health problems of the building occupants if there are problems with the building biology. Globalization has had significant impacts on people both in terms of jobs, skills, and self-sufficiency are lost when manufacturing facilities are closed and the cultural aspects of where new facilities are opened. Aspects of fair trade and labor rights are social costs of global building material manufacturing.\n\nBrush structures are built entirely from plant parts and were used in primitive cultures such as Native Americans and pygmy peoples in Africa These are built mostly with branches, twigs and leaves, and bark, similar to a beaver's lodge. These were variously named wikiups, lean-tos, and so forth.\n\nAn extension on the brush building idea is the wattle and daub process in which clay soils or dung, usually cow, are used to fill in and cover a woven brush structure. This gives the structure more thermal mass and strength. Wattle and daub is one of the oldest building techniques. Many older timber frame buildings incorporate wattle and daub as non load bearing walls between the timber frames.\n\nSnow and occasionally ice, were used by the Inuit peoples for igloos and snow is used to build a shelter called a quinzhee. Ice has also been used for ice hotels as a tourist attraction in northern climates.\n\nClay based buildings usually come in two distinct types. One being when the walls are made directly with the mud mixture, and the other being walls built by stacking air-dried building blocks called mud bricks.\n\nOther uses of clay in building is combined with straws to create light clay, wattle and daub, and mud plaster.\n\nWet-laid, or damp, walls are made by using the mud or clay mixture directly without forming blocks and drying them first. The amount of and type of each material in the mixture used leads to different styles of buildings. The deciding factor is usually connected with the quality of the soil being used. Larger amounts of clay are usually employed in building with \"cob\", while low-clay soil is usually associated with \"sod house\" or \"sod roof\" construction. The other main ingredients include more or less sand/gravel and straw/grasses. \"Rammed earth\" is both an old and newer take on creating walls, once made by compacting clay soils between planks by hand; nowadays forms and mechanical pneumatic compressors are used.\n\nSoil, and especially clay, provides good thermal mass; it is very good at keeping temperatures at a constant level. Homes built with earth tend to be naturally cool in the summer heat and warm in cold weather. Clay holds heat or cold, releasing it over a period of time like stone. Earthen walls change temperature slowly, so artificially raising or lowering the temperature can use more resources than in say a wood built house, but the heat/coolness stays longer.\n\nPeople building with mostly dirt and clay, such as cob, sod, and adobe, created homes that have been built for centuries in western and northern Europe, Asia, as well as the rest of the world, and continue to be built, though on a smaller scale. Some of these buildings have remained habitable for hundreds of years.\n\n\"Mud-bricks\", also known by their Spanish name \"adobe\" are ancient building materials with evidence dating back thousands of years BC. \"Compressed earth blocks\" are a more modern type of brick used for building more frequently in industrialized society since the building blocks can be manufactured off site in a centralized location at a brickworks and transported to multiple building locations. These blocks can also be monetized more easily and sold.\n\nStructural mud bricks are almost always made using clay, often clay soil and a binder are the only ingredients used, but other ingredients can include sand, lime, concrete, stone and other binders. The formed or compressed block is then air dried and can be laid dry or with a mortar or clay slip.\n\nSand is used with cement, and sometimes lime, to make mortar for masonry work and plaster. Sand is also used as a part of the concrete mix. An important low-cost building material in countries with high sand content soils is the Sandcrete block, which is weaker but cheaper than fired clay bricks.\n\nRock structures have existed for as long as history can recall. It is the longest lasting building material available, and is usually readily available. There are many types of rock throughout the world, all with differing attributes that make them better or worse for particular uses. Rock is a very dense material so it gives a lot of protection too; its main drawback as a material is its weight and awkwardness. Its energy density is also considered a big drawback, as stone is hard to keep warm without using large amounts of heating resources.\n\nDry-stone walls have been built for as long as humans have put one stone on top of another. Eventually, different forms of mortar were used to hold the stones together, cement being the most commonplace now.\n\nThe granite-strewn uplands of Dartmoor National Park, United Kingdom, for example, provided ample resources for early settlers. Circular huts were constructed from loose granite rocks throughout the Neolithic and early Bronze Age, and the remains of an estimated 5,000 can still be seen today. Granite continued to be used throughout the Medieval period (see Dartmoor longhouse) and into modern times. Slate is another stone type, commonly used as roofing material in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world where it is found.\n\nStone buildings can be seen in most major cities; some civilizations built entirely with stone such as the Egyptian and Aztec pyramids and the structures of the Inca civilization.\n\nThatch is one of the oldest of building materials known, Thatch is another word for grass; grass is a good insulator and easily harvested. Many African tribes have lived in homes made completely of grasses and sand year-round. In Europe, thatch roofs on homes were once prevalent but the material fell out of favor as industrialization and improved transport increased the availability of other materials. Today, though, the practice is undergoing a revival. In the Netherlands, for instance, many new buildings have thatched roofs with special ridge tiles on top.\n\nWood has been used as a building material for thousands of years in its natural state. Today, engineered wood is becoming very common in industrialized countries.\n\nWood is a product of trees, and sometimes other fibrous plants, used for construction purposes when cut or pressed into lumber and timber, such as boards, planks and similar materials. It is a generic building material and is used in building just about any type of structure in most climates. Wood can be very flexible under loads, keeping strength while bending, and is incredibly strong when compressed vertically. There are many differing qualities to the different types of wood, even among same tree species. This means specific species are better suited for various uses than others. And growing conditions are important for deciding quality.\n\n\"Timber\" is the term used for construction purposes except the term \"lumber\" is used in the United States. Raw wood (a log, trunk, bole) becomes timber when the wood has been \"converted\" (sawn, hewn, split) in the forms of minimally-processed logs stacked on top of each other, timber frame construction, and light-frame construction. The main problems with timber structures are fire risk and moisture-related problems.\n\nIn modern times softwood is used as a lower-value bulk material, whereas hardwood is usually used for finishings and furniture. Historically timber frame structures were built with oak in western Europe, recently douglas fir has become the most popular wood for most types of structural building.\n\nMany families or communities, in rural areas, have a personal woodlot from which the family or community will grow and harvest trees to build with or sell. These lots are tended to like a garden. This was much more prevalent in pre-industrial times, when laws existed as to the amount of wood one could cut at any one time to ensure there would be a supply of timber for the future, but is still a viable form of agriculture.\n\nBricks are made in a similar way to mud-bricks except without the fibrous binder such as straw and are \"fired\" (\"burned\" in a brick clamp or kiln) after they have air-dried to permanently harden them. Kiln fired clay bricks are a ceramic material. Fired bricks can be solid or have hollow cavities to aid in drying and make them lighter and easier to transport. The individual bricks are placed upon each other in courses using mortar. Successive courses being used to build up walls, arches, and other architectural elements. Fired brick walls are usually substantially thinner than cob/adobe while keeping the same vertical strength. They require more energy to create but are easier to transport and store, and are lighter than stone blocks. Romans extensively used fired brick of a shape and type now called Roman bricks. Building with brick gained much popularity in the mid-18th century and 19th centuries. This was due to lower costs with increases in brick manufacturing and fire-safety in the ever crowding cities.\n\nThe cinder block supplemented or replaced fired bricks in the late 20th century often being used for the inner parts of masonry walls and by themselves.\n\nStructural clay tiles (clay blocks) are clay or terracotta and typically are perforated with holes.\n\nCement bonded composites are made of hydrated cement paste that binds wood, particles, or fibers to make pre-cast building components. Various fiberous materials, including paper, fiberglass, and carbon-fiber have been used as binders.\n\nWood and natural fibers are composed of various soluble organic compounds like carbohydrates, glycosides and phenolics. These compounds are known to retard cement setting. Therefore, before using a wood in making cement bonded composites, its compatibility with cement is assessed.\n\nWood-cement compatibility is the ratio of a parameter related to the property of a wood-cement composite to that of a neat cement paste. The compatibility is often expressed as a percentage value. To determine wood-cement compatibility, methods based on different properties are used, such as, hydration characteristics, strength, interfacial bond and morphology. Various methods are used by researchers such as the measurement of hydration characteristics of a cement-aggregate mix; the comparison of the mechanical properties of cement-aggregate mixes and the visual assessment of microstructural properties of the wood-cement mixes. It has been found that the hydration test by measuring the change in hydration temperature with time is the most convenient method. Recently, Karade et al. have reviewed these methods of compatibility assessment and suggested a method based on the ‘maturity concept’ i.e. taking in consideration both time and temperature of cement hydration reaction.\n\nBricks were laid in lime mortar from the time of the Romans until supplanted by Portland cement mortar in the early 20th century. Cement blocks also sometimes are filled with grout or covered with a parge coat.\n\nConcrete is a composite building material made from the combination of aggregate and a binder such as cement. The most common form of concrete is Portland cement concrete, which consists of mineral aggregate (generally gravel and sand), portland cement and water.\n\nAfter mixing, the cement hydrates and eventually hardens into a stone-like material. When used in the generic sense, this is the material referred to by the term \"concrete\".\n\nFor a concrete construction of any size, as concrete has a rather low tensile strength, it is generally strengthened using steel rods or bars (known as rebars). This strengthened concrete is then referred to as reinforced concrete. In order to minimise any air bubbles, that would weaken the structure, a vibrator is used to eliminate any air that has been entrained when the liquid concrete mix is poured around the ironwork. Concrete has been the predominant building material in the modern age due to its longevity, formability, and ease of transport. Recent advancements, such as insulating concrete forms, combine the concrete forming and other construction steps (installation of insulation). All materials must be taken in required proportions as described in standards.\n\nThe tent is the home of choice among nomadic groups all over the world. Two well-known types include the conical teepee and the circular yurt. The tent has been revived as a major construction technique with the development of tensile architecture and synthetic fabrics. Modern buildings can be made of flexible material such as fabric membranes, and supported by a system of steel cables, rigid or internal, or by air pressure.\n\nRecently, synthetic polystyrene or polyurethane foam has been used in combination with structural materials, such as concrete. It is lightweight, easily shaped, and an excellent insulator. Foam is usually used as part of a structural insulated panel, wherein the foam is sandwiched between wood or cement or insulating concrete forms.\n\nGlassmaking is considered an art form as well as an industrial process or material.\n\nClear windows have been used since the invention of glass to cover small openings in a building. Glass panes provided humans with the ability to both let light into rooms while at the same time keeping inclement weather outside.\n\nGlass is generally made from mixtures of sand and silicates, in a very hot fire stove called a kiln, and is very brittle. Additives are often included the mixture used to produce glass with shades of colors or various characteristics (such as bulletproof glass or lightbulbs.\n\nThe use of glass in architectural buildings has become very popular in the modern culture. Glass \"curtain walls\" can be used to cover the entire facade of a building, or it can be used to span over a wide roof structure in a \"space frame\". These uses though require some sort of frame to hold sections of glass together, as glass by itself is too brittle and would require an overly large kiln to be used to span such large areas by itself.\n\nGlass bricks were invented in the early 20th century.\n\nGypcrete is a mixture of gypsum plaster and fibreglass rovings. Although plaster and fibres fiborous plaster have been used for many years, especially for ceilings, it was not until the early 1990s that serious studies of the strength and qualities of a walling system Rapidwall, using a mixture of gypsum plaster and 300mm plus fibreglass rovings, were investigated. It was discovered, through testing at the University of Adelaide, that these walls had significant, load bearing, shear and lateral resistance together with earthquake-resistance, fire-resistance, and thermal properties. With an abundance of gypsum (naturally occurring and by-product chemical FGD and phospho gypsums) available worldwide, gypcrete-based building products, which are fully recyclable, offer significant environmental benefits.\n\nMetal is used as structural framework for larger buildings such as skyscrapers, or as an external surface covering. There are many types of metals used for building. Metal figures quite prominently in prefabricated structures such as the Quonset hut, and can be seen used in most cosmopolitan cities. It requires a great deal of human labor to produce metal, especially in the large amounts needed for the building industries.\nCorrosion is metal's prime enemy when it comes to longevity.\n\nThe term \"plastics\" covers a range of synthetic or semi-synthetic organic condensation or polymerization products that can be molded or extruded into objects, films, or fibers. Their name is derived from the fact that in their semi-liquid state they are malleable, or have the property of plasticity. Plastics vary immensely in heat tolerance, hardness, and resiliency. Combined with this adaptability, the general uniformity of composition and lightness of plastics ensures their use in almost all industrial applications today. High performance plastics such as ETFE have become an ideal building material due to its high abrasion resistance and chemical inertness. Notable buildings that feature it include: the Beijing National Aquatics Center and the Eden Project biomes.\n\nBuilding papers and membranes are used for many reasons in construction. One of the oldest building papers is red rosin paper which was known to be in use before 1850 and was used as an underlayment in exterior walls, roofs, and floors and for protecting a jobsite during construction. Tar paper was invented late in the 19th century and was used for similar purposes as rosin paper and for gravel roofs. Tar paper has largely fallen out of use supplanted by asphalt felt paper. Felt paper has been supplanted in some uses by synthetic underlayments, particularly in roofing by synthetic underlayments and siding by housewraps.\n\nThere are a wide variety of damp proofing and waterproofing membranes used for roofing, basement waterproofing, and geomembranes.\n\nFired clay bricks have been used since the time of the Romans. Special tiles are used for roofing, siding, flooring, ceilings, pipes, flue liners, and more.\n\nIn the market place the term \"building products\" often refers to ready-made particles/sections, made from various materials, that are fitted in architectural hardware and decorative hardware parts of a building. The list of building products excludes the building materials used to construct the building architecture and supporting fixtures, like windows, doors, cabinets, etc. Building products, rather, support and make building materials work in a modular fashion.\n\n\"Building products\" may also refer to items used to put such hardware together, such as caulking, glues, paint, and anything else bought for the purpose of constructing a building.\n\n\n\nSvoboda, Luboš(2018).

It is located in Camberwell in South London, England, with two sites, located in Peckham Road and Wilson Road. It offers further and higher education programmes, including postgraduate and PhD awards. The College has retained single degree options within Fine Art, offering specialist Bachelor of Arts courses in painting, sculpture, photography and drawing. The College also runs graduate and postgraduate courses in art conservation and fine art as well as design courses such as Graphic Design, Illustration and 3D Design.\n\nThe College's history is closely linked with that of the South London Gallery, with which the College shares its site. The manager of the South London Working Men's College in 1868, William Rossiter, purchased the freehold of Portland House on which the College now stands in 1889. The resulting Gallery opened in 1891, followed by the Technical Institute, the school's first guise in 1898. \n\nThe philanthropist, John Passmore Edwards, gave a substantial sum of money for the erection of the building in memory of Lord Leighton. The architect was Maurice Bingham Adams. The school and gallery were the fruition of an artistic movement in Camberwell, supported by Edward Burne-Jones, Lord Leighton, Walter Crane and G F Watts. The school aimed to give the 'best artistic and technical education to all classes in the district'. Originally, the school offered classes in specific trades, such as architecture, cabinet design, embroidery, wood carving, wood block and stencil cutting. By 1920, a Fine Art Department had been created.\n\nDuring World War II, Victor Pasmore was appointed head of the school's Painting Department. He brought in William Coldstream, who in turn brought in Joe Dixon from the RCA and Claude Rogers. These three eminent Euston Road School painters, whose own work was figurative, initiated an exciting period for the School. Many well-known artists, including Frank Auerbach, Lawrence Gowing and Edward Ardizzone taught at Camberwell during this period. The prominent painter Robert Medley was Head of Painting in the early 1960s. Ron Kitaj, Kenneth Martin, Patrick Procktor, Euan Uglow, Frank Bowling and David Hepher all taught at the School during the 1960s and 70s. During this period, the School had a thriving art history department, headed by Conal Shields, that employed painters such as Harold Cohen and academics, including T. J. Clark. In 1973, the School expanded into a modern purpose-built block next to the existing premises. Both of them are now Listed Buildings. The College is currently undergoing a major £62 million redevelopment, working with Stephen Marshall Architects.\n\nIn the 1980s, Wendy Smith became the head of Fine Art and employed Noel Forster, John Hilliard, Cornelia Parker, Phyllida Barlow, Gavin Jantjes and Ian McKeever. Tony Messenger and Eileen Hogan took charge of the graphics department, Eileen Hogan established and ran The Camberwell Press, and Eric Ayers presided over the typography school. \n\nCamberwell School of Arts and Crafts became a constituent College of the London Institute in 1986, formed by the Inner London Education Authority to associate London's art, design, fashion and media schools into a collegiate structure. The school was renamed Camberwell College of Arts in 1989. During this restructuring Camberwell temporarily lost its Fine Art courses but by the time the London Institute was granted University status and was renamed University of the Arts London in 2004, the department had been fully restored to the College. \n\nWell-known artists who have taught at Camberwell include Richard Slee, Matt Franks, Brian Griffiths, Saskia Olde Wolbers, Fran Cottell, Rebecca Fortnum, Kelly Chorpening, Patricia Ellis, Anna Mossman, David Cross of Cornford & Cross, James Edgar, Daniel Sturgis, Rupert Norfolk, Duncan Wooldridge, Bernd Behr, Jordan McKenzie, Anne-marie Creamer, Danny Treacy and Hew Locke. In 2014 the American academic Hal Foster was appointed as 'Practitioner in Residence' within the Fine Art Department, In 2016 Griselda Pollock assumed this title.\n\nResearch projects at the college relate to a number of ongoing theoretical and practical debates in areas such as the interface of new technologies and creative practice; transnational art, identity and nation, and the conservation of Byzantine books and manuscripts. Camberwell is part of the University of the Arts London and its Research Network (RNUAL), which also includes Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, Chelsea College of Art and Design, London College of Communication and London College of Fashion.\n\nCamberwell has also had a number of prominent artists acting as researchers and lecturers such as the painters Humphrey Ocean and John Keane and the ceramicist Julian Stair. With strong links to the local community, Camberwell has a purpose built community art and exhibition space, \"Peckham Space\" designed by PENSON in Peckham Square. This project commission \"new multimedia, location-specific projects connecting art, people and place through creative experience\". Camberwell also oversees in partnership with the Arts Council of England the current scholarly research into John Latham, whose local residence \"Flat Time House\" has recently been turned into a museum.\n\nCamberwell is part of the University of the Arts London, and together with its sister colleges Chelsea College of Art and Design and Wimbledon College of Art makes up CCW, a three college model that allows each college to retain its own individual identity while allowing students access to teaching and learning facilities across the three colleges. CCW combined their foundation courses from the academic year starting in September 2011, and bases them at the Wilson Road campus in Camberwell. Other colleges of the University are Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, London College of Communication and London College of Fashion.\n\nInternationally, the College has links to other European art schools and Universities, and students regularly take part on ERASMUS educational exchanges to institutions in cities such as Marseille, Leipzig, Milan and Madrid. Further afield the college has links with colleges in Japan and America, with students taking part in projects at New York Studio School, Parsons The New School for Design New York, FIT NY and Yale School of Art.\n\nPeckham Platform is a purpose-built public gallery dedicated to commissioning location-specific artworks made in partnership with community groups. Originally known as Peckham Space and part of Camberwell College of Arts, University of the Arts London, in 2013 it became an independent charity. It seeks to encourage progression routes for young people into creative higher education as well as to increase access to cultural and educational activity in Peckham. Peckham Space is funded by the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF), Southwark Council and Arts Council England. The permanent venue on Peckham Square, designed by PENSON, opened in June 2010.\n\n\n\n"}

Usually dwarf galleries can be found at church towers or apses but they frequently appear at other parts of buildings as well, or even go around the entire building. Although principally meant as a decorative element, some dwarf galleries can be accessed. During the septennial Pilgrimage of the Relics in Maastricht, relics were shown daily from the dwarf gallery of St Servatius' to pilgrims gathered in front of the church in Vrijthof.\n\nDwarf galleries mainly appear at Romanesque churches in Germany and Italy. A few examples can be found in Belgium and the Netherlands (see Mosan art). Remarkably, in France no dwarf galleries were built. The oldest church in Germany with a dwarf gallery is Trier Cathedral. The apsis with dwarf gallery at Speyer Cathedral, described as “one of the most memorable pieces of Romanesque design”, was copied in many other places in the German Rhineland. Several of Cologne's twelve Romanesque churches feature dwarf galleries, as well as important Rhineland churches like Mainz Cathedral, Worms Cathedral and Bonn Minster.\n\nIn Italy, dwarf galleries appear at churches in the central and northern regions of the country. Examples are \"Santa Maria della Pieve\" in Arezzo, Modena Cathedral, Pistoia Cathedral, San Donato in Genoa and Pisa Cathedral. The famous Leaning Tower of Pisa could be described as having six rings of dwarf galleries.\n\nIn France, simple dwarf galleries are rare. But there was a luxurious development. In some façades, sculptures were placed between the columns. Most famous are the Galleries of Kings (Galeries des Rois) on Notre-Dame de Paris and the Cathedral of Amiens.\n\nDwarf galleries incidentally feature in Romanesque Revival architecture, notably in Germany, but also in other parts of the world.\n"}

The Finnish National Theatre is the oldest Finnish speaking professional theatre in Finland. It was known as the Finnish Theatre until 1902, when it was renamed the Finnish National Theatre.\n\nFor the first thirty years of its existence, the theatre functioned primarily as a touring company. The theatre did not acquire a permanent home until 1902, when a purpose-built structure was erected in the heart of Helsinki, adjacent to the city's main railway station. The building hosting the Finnish National Theatre today was completed in 1902 and designed by architect Onni Tarjanne in the National Romantic style, inspired by romantic nationalism. The theatre still operates in these premises today, and over the years the building has expanded from its original size to encompass another three permanent stages. In addition to the Main Stage (\"Suuri näyttämö\"), the theatre comprises the Small Stage (\"Pieni näyttämö\") built in 1954 (by architects Heikki Siren and Kaija Siren), the Willensauna Stage built in 1976, and the Omapohja studio built in 1987. The theatre is often associated with the Finnish national romantic writer Aleksis Kivi, as the Aleksis Kivi Memorial is located in front of it.\n\nThe Finnish National Theatre is the oldest Finnish speaking professional theatre in Finland. The birth of the Finnish National Theatre was closely linked to the nation's political and cultural ideology during the late nineteenth century. Finland was a part of the Russian Empire, and its intellectual elite was Swedish speaking. Finnish language and art, including theatre, became the cornerstones of a cultural movement which began in the 1860s, gradually developing political ambitions by the turn of the century, and eventually leading to national independence in 1917.\n\nThe theatre was established as a touring theatre in 1872 by the name \"Suomalainen teatteri\", The Finnish Theatre. The first performance was given in 13 October 1872 in the west coast town of Pori at the Hotel Otava, which today is considered to be the birthplace of the Finnish-language theatre. For the first thirty years of its existence, The Finnish Theatre functioned primarily as a touring company. Its first directors were the siblings Kaarlo and Emilie Bergbom. \n\nThe theatre did not acquire a permanent home until 1902, when a purpose-built structure was erected prominently in the heart of Helsinki, adjacent to the city's main railway station, the Helsinki Central railway station. The building was designed by Onni Tarjanne in the National Romantic style, inspired by romantic nationalism. At the same time, the name \"Finnish Theatre\" was switched into the \"Finnish National Theatre\". In 1939, the Aleksis Kivi Memorial (designed by Wäinö Aaltonen) was erected in front of the theatre, to commemorate the Aleksis Kivi and his role in Finnish theatrical art.\n\nThe Finnish National Theatre building is reportedly haunted by at least three ghosts - an unknown \"Grey Lady\" and the ghosts of actors Urho Somersalmi and Aarne Leppänen.\n\nThe Finnish National Theatre currently houses four permanent stages:\n\nThe theatre established a new production unit in 2010, which was given the name of Touring Stage. This unit, which has no fixed stage, aims to take small-scale touring performances to locations throughout the country which have little or no access to theatre, such as schools, day care centres, homes for the elderly, hospitals, welfare reception centres, prisons, and so on. The Touring Stage's programme focuses on topical issues which are developed through community research and interaction, reaching out and giving voice to marginalised sectors of society.\n\nIn January 2011 the theatre's former restaurant reopened as the Club Scene (), transformed into a late-evening club-like entertainment spot. The space has been given a new look, refurbished in a piano-bar stroke artist's living-room style, and hosts various types of music, drama, and poetry performances as well as discussion evenings and artist soirées.\n\n\n\n"}

It was co-written by Guest and Eugene Levy, and both also star in the film. The film's title is a phrase used in trade advertisements to promote films for honors such as the Academy Awards. The plot revolves around three actors (played by Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, and Harry Shearer) who learn that their performances in the film they haven't even completed yet, \"Home for Purim\", a drama set in the mid-1940s American South, are supposedly generating a great deal of award-season buzz.\n\nMany of the cast return from Guest's other films \"This Is Spinal Tap\", \"Waiting for Guffman\", \"Best in Show\", and \"A Mighty Wind\", including Levy, O'Hara, Posey, Shearer, Michael McKean, Fred Willard, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch, Ed Begley Jr., Michael Hitchcock, John Michael Higgins and Jim Piddock.\n\nRicky Gervais, the co-creator of the British television series \"The Office,\" also appears, while John Krasinski, Richard Kind, Scott Adsit, and Sandra Oh make brief cameos. Though the dialogue is largely improvised by the actors as in Guest's earlier films, the format is a departure from the mockumentary style.\n\nThe film received its World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, 2006. It was produced by Warner Independent Pictures in association with Castle Rock Entertainment and Shangri-La Entertainment.\n\nThe film follows the production of \"Home for Purim\", a low-budget drama film about a Jewish family in the southern United States in the 1940s. The cast consists of character actress Marilyn Hack (O'Hara) as the family's dying matriarch; veteran actor turned kosher hot dog mascot Victor Allen Miller (Shearer) as her husband; \"ingénue\" Callie Webb (Posey) as their lesbian daughter, whose return home with her girlfriend (Rachael Harris) serves as the driving plot of \"Home for Purim\"; and Brian Chubb (Christopher Moynihan), who is dating Webb, as their son.\n\nThe film's director (Guest) constantly incorporates bizarre camera shots and acting notes, while the producer (Coolidge), heiress to a diaper service, knows nothing about producing films. The two screenwriters (Balaban and McKean) are at odds with the director, as they struggle to align the film's period Southern setting with incongruous Jewish references and words.\nWhen an unattributed rumor begins to circulate that Hack, Miller, and Webb are likely to receive Oscar nominations for the film, each begins obsessing about the award. Hack pretends not to care while secretly pining for the award, Miller demands a higher salary and pushes his agent (Levy) for more dignified work, and Webb breaks up with Chubb. Later, the hosts of entertainment news program \"Hollywood Now\" (Willard and Lynch) visit the set and interview the cast.\n\nThe studio intervenes in the production of \"Home for Purim\" and, deeming the film to be \"too Jewish,\" re-title it \"Home for Thanksgiving\". Despite this, the Oscar buzz around the film intensifies, and the three prospective nominees begin to make press appearances to promote the film. Miller appears on a hip-hop teen show called \"Chillaxin\"' in youthful attire with capped teeth, a tan, and dyed blonde hair. Hack gets breast implants and extensive plastic surgery to the point where her face is comically ecstatic. Webb goes on a shock jock radio show, only to field questions exclusively about her nude scenes. \n\nThe Academy Award nominations are announced, and only Chubb (who sleeps through the morning of the announcement) is nominated. Miller returns to auditioning for commercials. Webb attempts to revive her failed one-woman show, \"No Penis Intended\". Hack makes a drunken rant on \"Hollywood Now\" and becomes an acting teacher, having made an uncomfortable peace with her mediocre career.\n\n\nBased on 160 reviews collected by the film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 51% of critics gave \"For Your Consideration\" a positive review, with an average rating of 5.8/10. Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars, describing it as \"uncanny in its dead-on parodies of TV and radio talk shows and other follies of show business”.\n\nCatherine O'Hara won the National Board of Review's Best Supporting Actress award and was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award in the category of Best Female Lead. O'Hara's performance earned many good reviews, spurring for a short time rumors that, in an ironic twist, she could be nominated for an Academy Award.\n\n\n"}

Jackson, Julianne Moore, Edie Falco, Ron Eldard, William Forsythe, Aunjanue Ellis, and Anthony Mackie. It is based on Richard Price's 1998 novel of the same name, which touches on themes of covert racism.\n\nBrenda (Julianne Moore) walks through a predominantly African American housing project and enters an emergency room, apparently in shock and with cut and bleeding hands. Police detective Lorenzo Council (Samuel L. Jackson) is sent to take a statement from Brenda, who says that her car has been stolen. When Lorenzo gets there, she reveals that her young son, Cody, was in the back seat of the car. The police frantically begin searching for Cody.\n\nBrenda's brother, Danny (Ron Eldard), a police officer in a neighboring town, calls a massive police presence in to search the housing project for clues. This angers the residents who protest their innocence. Lorenzo begins to suspect that Brenda is holding back details from him and pressures her to tell the truth. She insists that she has told the truth and would never harm her son. With a sketch artist she produces a picture of the man she says stole her car. Danny's white coworkers arrest a man from the housing project who they think matches the picture. Danny flies into a rage and beats him. \n\nDesperate to find Cody, Lorenzo enlists the aid of a volunteer group which helps search for missing children. He suggests that they search Freedomland, an abandoned foundling hospital nearby. As they search, the group's leader Karen Collucci (Edie Falco) talks with Brenda. Collucci had lost her own son years before and convinces Brenda to admit that Cody is dead. She leads them to a nearby park where they find Cody's body in a shallow grave, covered with heavy rocks. \n\nLorenzo realizes that Brenda could not have moved the rocks herself. Under interrogation Brenda admits to having been engaged in an affair with a man named Billy (Anthony Mackie) who lived in the projects. She would give Cody cough syrup so that he would fall asleep and she could visit Billy. On the night in question she had returned to find Cody dead, having drunk a whole bottle of cough syrup. Billy helped her bury his body. When the police go to arrest Billy, they are confronted by residents angry over previous unfounded police harassment and a riot erupts. Brenda is charged with criminal neglect, and Lorenzo promises to visit her in jail.\n\nShooting took place mostly in Yonkers, New York.\n\n\"Freedomland\" holds an approval rating of 23% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 149 reviews. The consensus states: \"Poorly directed and overacted, \"Freedomland\" attempts to address sensitive race and class issues but its overzealousness misses the mark.\" Metacritic rated it 43/100 based on 35 reviews.\n\nThe film grossed $14.7 million against its $30 million budget.\n\n"}

{"id": "12285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12285", "title": "Grand Guignol", "text": "Grand Guignol\n\nLe Théâtre du Grand-Guignol (: \"The Theatre of the Great Puppet\") – known as the Grand Guignol – was a theatre in the Pigalle area of Paris (at 20 bis, ). From its opening in 1897 until its closing in 1962, it specialised in naturalistic horror shows. Its name is often used as a general term for graphic, amoral horror entertainment, a genre popular from Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre (for instance Shakespeare's \"Titus Andronicus\", and Webster's \"The Duchess of Malfi\" and \"The White Devil\"), to today's splatter films.\n\n\"Le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol\" was founded in 1894 by Oscar Méténier, who planned it as a space for naturalist performance. With 293 seats, the venue was the smallest in Paris.\n\nA former chapel, the theatre's previous life was evident in the boxes – which looked like confessionals – and in the angels over the orchestra. Although the architecture created frustrating obstacles, the design that was initially a predicament ultimately became beneficial to the marketing of the theatre. The opaque furniture and gothic structures placed sporadically on the walls of the building exude a feeling of eeriness from the moment of entrance. People came to this theatre for an experience, not only to see a show. The audience at \"Le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol\" endured the terror of the shows because they wanted to be filled with strong “feelings” of something. Many attended the shows to get a feeling of arousal. Underneath the balcony were boxes (originally built for nuns to watch church services) that were available for theatre-goers to rent during performances because they would get so aroused by the action happening on stage. It has been said that audience members would get so boisterous in the boxes, that actors would sometimes break character and yell something such as “Keep it down in there!” Conversely, there were audience members who could not physically handle the brutality of the actions taking place on stage. Frequently, the “special effects” would be too realistic and often an audience member would faint or vomit during performances.\n\nThe theatre owed its name to Guignol, a traditional Lyonnaise puppet character, joining political commentary with the style of Punch and Judy.\n\nThe theatre's peak was between World War I and World War II, when it was frequented by royalty and celebrities in evening dress.\n\nOscar Méténier was the Grand Guignol's founder and original director. Under his direction, the theatre produced plays about a class of people who were not considered appropriate subjects in other venues: prostitutes, criminals, street urchins and others at the lower end of Paris's social echelon.\n\nMax Maurey served as director from 1898 to 1914. Maurey shifted the theatre's emphasis to the horror plays it would become famous for and judged the success of a performance by the number of patrons who passed out from shock; the average was two faintings each evening. Maurey discovered André de Lorde, who would become the most important playwright for the theatre.\n\nDe Lorde was the theatre's principal playwright from 1901 to 1926. He wrote at least 100 plays for the Grand Guignol and collaborated with experimental psychologist Alfred Binet to create plays about insanity, one of the theatre's favourite and frequently recurring themes.\n\nCamille Choisy served as director from 1914 to 1930. He contributed his expertise in special effects and scenery to the theatre's distinctive style.\n\nJack Jouvin served as director from 1930 to 1937. He shifted the theatre's subject matter, focusing performances not on gory horror but psychological drama. Under his leadership, the theatre's popularity waned and, after World War II, it was not well-attended.\n\nCharles Nonon was the theatre's last director.\n\nAt the Grand Guignol, patrons would see five or six plays, all in a style that attempted to be brutally true to the theatre's naturalistic ideals. The plays were in a variety of styles, but the most popular and best known were the horror plays, featuring a distinctly bleak worldview as well as notably gory special effects in their notoriously bloody climaxes. The horrors depicted at Grand Guignol were generally not supernatural; these plays often explored the altered states, like insanity, hypnosis, or panic, under which uncontrolled horror could happen. To heighten the effect, the horror plays were often alternated with comedies.\n\n\"Le Laboratoire des Hallucinations\", by André de Lorde: When a doctor finds his wife's lover in his operating room, he performs a graphic brain surgery, rendering the adulterer a hallucinating semi-zombie. Now insane, the lover/patient hammers a chisel into the doctor's brain.\n\n\"Un Crime dans une Maison de Fous\", by André de Lorde: Two hags in an insane asylum use scissors to blind a pretty, young fellow inmate out of jealousy.\n\n\"L'Horrible Passion\", by André de Lorde: A nanny strangles the children in her care.\n\n\"Le Baiser dans la Nuit\", by Maurice Level: A young woman visits the man whose face she horribly disfigured with acid, where he obtains his revenge.\n\nAudiences waned in the years following World War II, and the Grand Guignol closed its doors in 1962. Management attributed the closure in part to the fact that the theatre's faux horrors had been eclipsed by the actual events of the Holocaust two decades earlier. \"We could never equal Buchenwald,\" said its final director, Charles Nonon. \"Before the war, everyone felt that what was happening onstage was impossible. Now we know that these things, and worse, are possible in reality.\"\n\nThe Grand Guignol building still exists. It is occupied by , a company devoted to presenting plays in sign language.\n\nGrand Guignol flourished briefly in London in the early 1920s under the direction of Jose Levy, where it attracted the talents of Sybil Thorndike and Noël Coward, and a series of short English \"Grand Guignol\" films (using original screenplays, not play adaptations) was made at the same time, directed by Fred Paul. Several of the films exist at the BFI National Archive.\n\nThe Grand Guignol was revived once again in London in 1945, under the direction of Frederick Witney, where it ran for two seasons at the Granville Theatre. These included premiers of Witney's own work as well as adaptations of French originals.\n\nIn recent years, English director-writer, Richard Mazda, has re-introduced New York audiences to the Grand Guignol. His acting troupe, The Queens Players, have produced six mainstage productions of Grand Guignol plays, and Mazda is writing new plays in the classic Guignol style. The sixth production, \"Theatre of Fear\", included De Lorde's famous adaptation of Poe's \"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\" (\"Le Systéme du Dr Goudron et Pr Plume\") as well as two original plays, \"Double Crossed\" and \"The Good Death\" alongside \"The Tell Tale Heart\".\n\nThe 1963 mondo film \"Ecco\" includes a scene which may have been filmed at the Grand Guignol theatre during its final years.\n\nAmerican avant-garde composer John Zorn released an album called \"Grand Guignol\" by Naked City in 1992, in a reference to \"the darker side of our existence which has always been with us and always will be\".\n\nWashington, D.C.'s Molotov Theatre Group, established in 2007, is dedicated to preserving and exploring the aesthetic of the Grand Guignol. They have entered two plays into the Capital Fringe Festival in Washington, D.C. Their 2007 show, \"For Boston\", won \"Best Comedy\", and their second show, \"The Sticking Place\", won \"Best Overall\" in 2008.\n\nThe Swiss theatre company, Compagnie Pied de Biche revisits the Grand Guignol genre in contemporary contexts since 2008. The company staged in 2010 a diptych \"Impact & Dr. Incubis\", based on original texts by Nicolas Yazgi and directed by Frédéric Ozier. More than literal adaptations, the plays address violence, death, crime and fear in contemporary contexts, while revisiting many trope of the original Grand Guignol corpus, often with humour.\n\nRecently formed London-based Grand Guignol company Theatre of the Damned, brought their first production to the Camden Fringe in 2010 and produced the award nominated \"Grand Guignol\" in November of that year. In 2011, they staged \"Revenge of the Grand Guignol\" at the Courtyard Theatre, London, as part of the London Horror Festival.\n\nAlso based in London, Le Nouveau Guignol form the UK's only permanent repertory Grand Guignol company; plays within their current repertoire include French Guignol classics such as \"The Final Kiss\", \"Tics... Or Doing the Deed\", \"The Lighthouse Keepers\", \"Private Room Number Six\" and \"The Kiss of Blood\". However, as their company remit also includes encouraging new writing, they have also staged several new plays in the Grand-Guignol style, including \"Eating For Two\", \"Penalty\" and \"Ways and Means\". Le Nouveau Guignol took part in the London Horror Festival alongside Theatre of the Damned at Courtyard Theatre in November 2011.\n\nThe Grand Guignolers in Los Angeles, California, established in 2007, create and perform traditional Grand Guignol and original works as a 1920s Parisian theatre troupe. Shows are staged as event and draw on multiple forms of traditional physical theatrical genres in new ways including Commedia dell'arte, melodrama, mime, mask, clown, dance, vaudeville, magic, and puppetry. Many shows play with the literal 'big puppet' theme utilizing puppetry at various levels including the Petits Guignolers, a French existentially lewd finger puppet show with Grand Guignol effects. The company paid homage to its namesake by staging a surprise 200th birthday party for Guignol with \"A Grand Guignol Children's Show* (*NOT for Children)\". In addition to evenings of classic Grand Guignol, original productions have included \"A Very Grand Guignol Christmas\" and \"Absinthe, Opium and Magic, 1920s Shanghai\".\n\nIn August to October 2013, the Xoregos Performing Company presented \"Danse Macabre\", a contemporary tribute to Grand Guignol at Theater for the New City in New York City. \"Danse Macabre\" was a program of four plays of psychological and physical terror, one humorous work and a dance, in keeping with Grand Guignol's programming history. The run ended October 27 at the Bronx Museum of the Arts. The playwrights were Dave deChristopher, Jack Feldstein, Dylan Guy, Pamela Scott and Joel Trinidad. Choreographer and Director, Shela Xoregos.\n\nIn November 2014, 86 years after the last show of Alfredo Sainati's \"La Compagnia del Grand-Guignol\", founded in 1908 and which had been the only example of Grand Guignol in Italy, the Convivio d'Arte Company presented in Milan \"Grand Guignol de Milan: Le Cabaret des Vampires\". The show was an original tribute to Grand Guignol, a horror vaudeville with various horror and grotesque performances such as monologues, live music and burlesque, with a satirical black humour conduction.\nWhile the original Grand Guignol attempted to present naturalistic horror, the performances would seem melodramatic and heightened to today's audience. For this reason, the term is often applied to films and plays of a stylised nature with heightened acting, melodrama and theatrical effects such as \"\", \"Sleepy Hollow\", \"Quills\", and the Hammer Horror films that went before them. \"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\"; \"Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte\"; \"What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?\"; \"What's the Matter with Helen?\"; \"Night Watch\" and \"Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?\" form a sub-branch of the genre called Grande Dame Guignol for its use of aging A-list actresses in sensational horror films.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "599440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=599440", "title": "John Heminges", "text": "John Heminges\n\nJohn Heminges (spelled Heming, Hemynges and — in both the First Folio, which he edited, and also on the monument in the graveyard where he is buried — it is spelled Heminge) (bapt. 25 November 1566 – 10 October 1630) was an actor in the King's Men, the playing company for which William Shakespeare wrote. Along with Henry Condell, he was an editor of the First Folio, the collected plays of Shakespeare, published in 1623. He was also the financial manager for the King's Men.\n\nHeminges was baptised at, at St Peter de Witton Church, Droitwich, Worcestershire, on 25 November 1566. Sent to London at the age of twelve, he was apprenticed for nine years to the City Grocer John Collins, becoming a freeman of the Grocers' Company on 24 April 1587. On 10 March 1588 he received a licence to marry Rebecca Knell (née Edwards), the widow of William Knell, an actor with the Queen's Men who had been killed at Thame, Oxfordshire, in 1587 by John Towne, a fellow actor. Heminges and his sixteen-year-old wife settled in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury, and had at least thirteen children there between the years 1590 and 1613.\n\nHeminges's association with the theatre had begun by 1593, when he and Augustine Phillips were with Lord Strange's Men. By the next year he and Phillips had joined the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later the King's Men. Heminges remained with the Company until his death. Privy Council records from 1630 state that he received £100 to relieve the Company during a period of plague.\n\nHeminges remained active in the Grocers' Company alongside his theatrical activities; indeed, the two sometimes intertwined. On 13 December 1608 he was admitted as one of the ten seacoal-meters for the city of London, citizens appointed to measure the coal imported into the city by sea. Shortly afterwards he took on John Jackson as his deputy. Both Heminges and Jackson later acted as trustees for William Shakespeare when he purchased the Blackfriars Gatehouse in 1613. Between 1595 and 1628 Heminges took on ten apprentices with the Grocers' Company. Of these ten, eight appear to have performed for Heminges's company, in both boys' and adult roles. Alexander Cooke was one of his apprentices. Heminges also built and operated a taphouse at the Globe.\n\nHeminges was mentioned in Shakespeare's will, along with Richard Burbage and Henry Condell, each being bequeathed 26 shillings and eightpence to buy mourning rings. Stanley Wells and others have wondered if that bequest represented a kind of pact for the three men to create and publish an edition of Shakespeare’s collected plays. Burbage died before the publication of the \"First Folio\", but Heminges and Condell became co-editors of the book. They mentioned in their preface, \"To the great Variety of Readers\", that they wished \"the Author himselfe had liv'd to have set forth, and overseen his owne writings\", they also mention their own care and pain \"to haue collected & publish’d\" the works. Their editorial efforts were vital to preserving a number of Shakespeare's plays, some of which might have been lost otherwise.\n\nAs a sharer in the Globe Theatre, Heminges’ name, along with the other sharers, is mentioned several times in various legal documents that were discovered by American researcher Charles William Wallace. The Globe was plagued by lawsuits as the shares were left to beneficiaries who did not have the continued welfare of the company at heart. In one such lawsuit, Heminges v. Ostler, Heminges was sued by his daughter, Thomasina Ostler over a share of the company. The surviving records do not specify the final outcome of the suit. At his death, Heminges’ shares in the Globe and Blackfriars theatres passed to his son, William Heminges. The lawsuit records are valuable to historians for the detailed information they contain regarding the company business.\n\nHeminges died in October 1630 in Southwark, and was buried 12 October 1630 at the parish church of St Mary Aldermanbury. In his will he had asked to be buried as close to his wife as possible.\n\nThe extent and nature of Heminges' acting is not entirely clear. He is known to have performed in Ben Jonson's \"Sejanus\" and \"Every Man in His Humour\" (in both cases, alongside Shakespeare). A Jacobean inscription in the 1616 Jonson folio lists him playing the role of Corbaccio in \"Volpone\"; since the same list includes Nathan Field, who did not join the King's Men until 1616, it seems that Heminges continued to act, at least intermittently, into his fifties. Edmond Malone reported seeing Heminges' name associated with the role of Falstaff; there is, however, no other evidence of this connection. There is little more evidence to substantiate the claim later made by an actor to Alexander Pope that Heminges was a tragedian. Of his activities as manager more is known. Court documents relating to the King's Men generally list Heminges as the recipient of money due the company; the records of Henry Herbert indicate that Heminges at least sometimes served as the point of contact between the company and the Master of the Revels. He appears to have owned a structure abutting the Globe Theatre, which may have been used as an alehouse. He served as trustee for Shakespeare when the latter purchased a house in Blackfriars in 1613.\n\n\n"}

A well-known example is the Loch Ness Monster. Lake monsters' depictions are often similar to sea monsters.\n\nAccording to the Swedish naturalist and author Bengt Sjögren (1980), the present-day lake monsters are variations of older legends of water kelpies. Sjögren claims that the accounts of lake-monsters have changed during history, as do others. Older reports often talk about horse-like appearances, but more modern reports often have more reptile and dinosaur-like appearances, he concludes that the legendary kelpies evolved into the present day saurian lake-monsters since the discovery of dinosaurs and giant aquatic reptiles and the popularization of them in both scientific and fictional writings and art.\n\nThe stories cut across cultures, existing in some variation in many countries. They've undergone what Michel Meurger calls concretizing (The process of turning items, drawings, general beliefs and stories into a plausible whole) and naturalization over time as humanity's view of the world has changed.\n\nIn many of these areas, especially around Loch Ness, Lake Champlain and the Okanagan Valley, these lake monsters have become important tourist draws.\n\nIn Ben Radford and Joe Nickell's book \"Lake Monster Mysteries\", the authors attribute a vast number of sightings to otter misidentifications. Ed Grabianowski plotted the distribution of North American lake monster sightings. Then he overlaid the distribution of the common otter and found a near perfect match. It turns out that three or four otters swimming in a line look remarkably like a serpentine, humped creature undulating through the water. It is very easy to mistake for a single creature if you see them from a distance. \"This isn't speculation. I'm not making this up,\" Nickell said. \"I've spoken to people who saw what they thought was a lake monster, got closer and discovered it was actually a line of otters. That really happens.\" Clearly, not every lake monster sighting can be accounted for with otters, but it's an excellent example of how our perceptions can be fooled.\n\nPaul Barrett and Darren Naish note that the existence of any large animals in isolation (i.e., in a situation where no breeding population exists) is highly unlikely. Naish also observes that the stories are likely remnants of tales meant to keep children safely away from the water.\n\nThere have been many purported sightings of lake monsters, and even some photographs, but each time these have either been shown to be deliberate deceptions, such as the Lake George Monster Hoax, or serious doubts about the veracity and verifiability have arisen, as with the famous Mansi photograph of Champ.\n\nWell-known lake monsters include:\n"}

{"id": "36283978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36283978", "title": "Lookism", "text": "Lookism\n\nLookism is discriminatory treatment toward people considered physically unattractive, mainly in the workplace but also in dating and other social settings. While not classified in the same way as racial, cultural, sexual discrimination, \"lookism\" is widespread and affects how people are perceived as well as affecting their opportunities in terms of romantic relationships, job opportunities, etc.\n\nPhysical attractiveness is associated with good things; in contrast, physical unattractiveness is associated with negative things. Many people make judgments of others based on their physical appearance that influence how they respond to those people. Research on the \"What is beautiful is good\" stereotype shows that, overall, those who are physically attractive benefit from their good looks: physically attractive individuals are perceived more positively and physical attractiveness has a strong influence on judgment of a person's competence. In return, physically attractive people benefit from these stereotypical beliefs. Research shows that on average, physically attractive individuals have more friends, better social skills, and more active sex lives. However, attractiveness does not have any effect on the level of happiness experienced by the individual.\n\nThough the term \"lookism\" is of recent coinage, cultures and traditions worldwide have often warned against placing undue value on physical appearance:\n\nTo judge by appearances is to get entangled in the Veil of Maya [in Buddhist thought] ... From ancient times until relatively recently, there was widespread worry about lookism, because the appearance of others may deceive, especially in romance, or it may be personally or politically imprudent to judge or act on appearances. Judging by appearances was prohibited by monotheistic religions (\"no graven images\") and criticized in ancient and medieval philosophies. Skeptics, Stoics, Cynics, Epicureans and Scholastics elaborated various reasons to avoid or subordinate the role of appearances.\n\nHowever, the term \"lookism\" was first coined in the 1970s within the fat acceptance movement. It was used in \"The Washington Post\" Magazine in 1978, which asserted that the term was coined by fat people who created the word to refer to \"discrimination based on looks.\" The word appears in several major English language dictionaries. There is some overlap between the terms teratophobia, cacophobia and lookism.\n\nLookism has received scholarly attention both from a cultural studies and an economics perspective. In the former context, lookism relates to preconceived notions of beauty and cultural stereotyping based on appearance as well as gender roles and expectations. Important economic considerations include the question of income gaps based on looks, as well as increased or decreased productivity from workers considered beautiful or ugly by their co-workers. Due to this, new problems arise that are tied to other social issues like racism and ageism (young over old). The idea of beauty is also linked directly to social class because people who have more free time and money have the ability to work on their appearance. Weight is also linked to social class because people who are overweight do not have the exercise equipment or the healthy food choices that wealthier people do. Judging people on the basis of attractiveness decreases a person's self-esteem leading to a negative self-image.\n\nSome writers have examined this phenomenon among gay men. According to the block quote on page 117 of a 2004 work by Todd Morrison, author Michelangelo Signorile (in a 1997 overview of contemporary trends in the gay male community) described \"body fascism\" asthe setting of a rigid set of standards of physical beauty that pressures everyone within a particular group to conform to them. Any person who doesn't meet those very specific standards is deemed physically unattractive and sexually undesirable. In a culture in which the physical body is held in such high esteem and given such power, body fascism then not only deems those who don't or can't conform to be sexually less desirable, but in the extreme – sometimes dubbed \"looksism\" – also deems an individual completely worthless \"as a person,\" based solely on his exterior. In this sense it is not unlike racism or sexism or homophobia itself. ... (p. 28)\n\nAccording to Nancy Etcoff, a psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, \"we face a world where lookism is one of the most pervasive but denied prejudices\". Referring to several studies, Angela Stalcup writes that \"The evidence clearly indicates that not only is there a premium for prettiness in Western culture, there is also penalty for plainness.\" When discrimination on the grounds of a person's appearance turns into fear or conveyed aversion, it is referred to as cacophobia. Sometimes cacophobia may be internalized and thus directed inwards rather than towards others.\n\nStudies on newborns have found that human infants as young as 14 hours from birth prefer to look at attractive faces rather than unattractive faces. The preference also extends to non-human animals such as cats. These findings indicate that lookism is an innate product of how the human visual system functions.\n\nResearch by Dan Ariely found that American women exhibit a marked preference for dating taller men, and that for shorter men to be judged attractive by women, they must earn substantially more money than taller men. \n\nIn the article \"Is Lookism Unjust\", Louis Tietje and Steven Cresap discuss when discrimination based on looks can legitimately be described as unjust. Tietje and Cresap quote evidence that suggests there exists \"a 7–to–9 percent 'penalty' for being in the lowest 9 percent of looks among all workers, and a 5 percent 'premium' for being in the top 33 percent\". While accepting that the evidence indicates that such discrimination does occur, the authors argue that it has been pervasive throughout history and that judgments of aesthetics appear to be a biological adaptation (rather than culturally conditioned) to aid reproduction, survival and social interaction, allowing people to determine viable mates (level of attractiveness being indicative of health) and the status of others as \"friend or enemy, threat or opportunity\". The authors also argue that if physical attractiveness can improve a company's success, then awarding people for it is justifiable, as the trait is thus relevant to the job and discrimination only occurs when irrelevant traits are used. In addition, the authors question the practicality of both redressing any injustices based on lookism and of determining whether such injustices have in fact occurred. Thus the authors conclude that there can be no clear model of injustice in such discrimination, nor would legislation to address it be practicable – \"We do not see how any policy interventions to redress beauty discrimination can be justified.\"\n\nLookism has been an issue in politics for centuries, with a long tradition in the United Kingdom of \"mercilessly exaggerat[ing]\" the physical flaws of politicians in newspaper cartoons. In the 1960 Presidential race between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, it was often believed that Kennedy's more conventionally handsome appearance contributed to his winning more approval in their first televised debate, but some researchers have challenged this widespread idea and argued that Kennedy's appearance had little or no influence.\n\nThere are several variables that might contribute to the objectification of masculinity and femininity in politics. Scholar Charlotte Hooper argued that \"gender intersects with other social divisions such as class, race and sexuality to produce complex hierarchies of (gendered) identities\". Hooper argues that institutional practices, such as military combat in war, have greatly defined what it means to be a man. Furthermore, the symbolic dimension, which includes sports, media, current affairs, etc. has \"disseminate[d] a wealth of popular iconography which links Western masculinities to the wider world beyond the borders of the state\". This is where the ideology of lookism is firmly entrenched according to Hooper. Similarly, Laura Shepherd suggests that men are required to fit into the \"matrix of intelligibility\" by acting a certain way, dressing a certain way, and have a mentality that is devoid of emotion or anything effeminate; if they are successful in becoming the ultimate \"man's man\" then they are virtually untouchable. However, others have suggested that there is only an explicit interest in the analysis of masculinity within this political sphere, it will be impossible to develop a reliable analysis of femininity within this same sphere.\n\nDrawing examples from Madeleine Albright's TED talk in 2010, \"On Being a Woman and Diplomat\", Albright expressed her frustrations with how her male colleagues and media commentators would pick apart her appearance. Being the first female Secretary of State for the United States, Albright was in the spotlight on the domestic and international stage; everything from her age, weight, hairstyle and choice of dress were scrutinized; yet ironically, the policy positions she believed to be her most important accomplishments (initiation of the G7, attempts to promote gender equality, etc.) were hardly taken into account. The fact that Albright's general appearance didn't fit into the narrow category of \"attractive\" made it even more difficult for her to navigate the space between being a woman and a diplomat. Albright is not the only woman in a position of power, or otherwise, that has been discriminated against because of her appearance. An article published in \"The Washington Post\" in 2005 labeled Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, as a \"dominatrix\" when she stepped out in knee-high black-heeled boots during a visit to Wiesbaden Military Base in Germany. Although the article was meant to give credit to Rice for \"challeng[ing] expectations and assumptions\", some argue that the article gave her a hyper-sexualized image, and further removed the audience from focusing on the purpose of her visit to the military place. Similarly, media commentators have often chosen to report on Hillary Clinton's \"man suits\" and Julia Gillard's short hairstyle, instead of focusing on these women's professional accomplishments. Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican Vice-Presidential candidate, was the subject of much media attention due to her conventionally attractive appearance, with Palin suggesting that the focus on her appearance ignored her professional and policy accomplishments.\n\nUntil the 1970s, lookism in the United States was sometimes codified into law. In many jurisdictions, so-called \"ugly laws\" barred people from appearing in public if they had diseases or disfigurements that were considered unsightly. Today, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission considers extreme obesity to be a disability protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act, and a few cities protect against discrimination based on appearance. Otherwise, there is no federal law protecting against discrimination based on physical appearance.\n\n\n"}

She later moved to Spain, taking up the position of governess and later secretary to Princess Bibesco and eventually becoming a foreign correspondent based within Madrid. Laverty returned to Ireland for the remainder of her career and worked as a journalist and broadcaster in Dublin for the national radio station, RTÉ.\n\nUpon her return to Ireland she married the journalist James Laverty in 1928. They had three children, one of whom was the artist Barry Castle, who illustrated some of her mother's work.\n\nHer first novel \"Never No More\" was published to widespread acclaim in 1942. It was based in County Kildare, drawing heavily on personal experiences during her time in Derrymore House. Laverty would follow this with such works as \"Touched by the Thorn\" (1943) and \"Alone We Embark\" (1943). Two of her books were banned in the Republic of Ireland, including her second, the semi-autobiographical \"No More than Human\", which apparently offended the censor because of its frankness about the female body.\n\nShe is well known as the writer of RTÉ's \"Tolka Row\", the station's first soap opera that ran between 1964 and 1968, itself largely an adaptation of her play \"Liffey Lane\".

{"id": "6375654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6375654", "title": "Non finito", "text": "Non finito\n\nNon finito is a sculpting technique meaning that the work is unfinished. Italian in origin, it literally means \"not finished\". Non finito sculptures appear unfinished because the artist only sculpts part of the block, the figure sometimes appearing to be stuck within the block of material. It was pioneered by Donatello during the Renaissance and was used by Michelangelo as well as numerous other artists.\n\nThe philosophic origins of non finito practice come from antiquity and the theories of Plato. Platonic philosophy states that any work of art, or otherwise, never completely resembles its heavenly counterpart. The act of leaving a work unfinished is sometimes an homage to this. In the case of the ancient Romans, artists would sign their work with the verb \"Faciebat\" (third-person singular imperfect active indicative of faciō). This verb, following their name, would identify them as the artist, but the work as unfinished (non finito). Artists signed their work in this manner even if the work had been refined to the highest degree, as when Michelangelo famously signed his Roman Pieta.\n\n"}

The Spanish Village era is said to have ended in the mid-1950s.\n\nPaseo has undergone transformations; currently, the Paseo is enjoying a renaissance since the 1980s. Today, a vibrant group of artists and other interested people are transforming this community through creative thinking and arts activities.\n\nLocated along Paseo Drive at roughly N. Walker Ave and NW 28th Street, the faux Spanish village with its stucco buildings and clay tile roofs is the home to many of Oklahoma City's Artists.\n\nThe Paseo Arts district is home to a number of chic bars, restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, art galleries, and avant-garde businesses. Since 1975, Paseo hosts the annual Paseo Arts Festival each Memorial Day weekend, which showcases original works of visual and performing arts. Other events within the Paseo Arts district include its annual Fairy Ball, as well as the First Friday Gallery Walk. The First Friday Gallery Walk is an event in which Paseo art galleries and restaurants host Art Opening Receptions on the first Friday of every month in order to displaying new artist's work and invite people to visit the Paseo district.\n\nThe district is also home to the oldest church in Oklahoma, Old Trinity of Paseo. The former Anglican church was built in New Brunswick, Canada in 1842 and was closed in 1990. Oklahoma City photographer Tom Lee purchased the church in 2000 and had it dismantled and moved to Oklahoma City to serve as his studio. Lee sold the church in 2007 to be rented as a venue for weddings and other events.\n\nThe Paseo district is listed as a neighborhood ‘worthy of preservation’ on the National Register of Historic Places and in 2010, was named as one of the ’10 Great Neighborhoods for 2010’ by the American Planning Association.\n\nAmong the galleries in the district is JRB Art at the Elms Gallery, housed in the former home of painter and museum director Nan Sheets.\n\n"}

{"id": "26181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26181", "title": "Ray Bradbury", "text": "Ray Bradbury\n\nRay Douglas Bradbury (; August 22, 1920June 5, 2012) was an American author and screenwriter. He worked in a variety of genres, including fantasy, science fiction, horror, and mystery fiction.\n\nWidely known for his dystopian novel \"Fahrenheit 451\" (1953), and his science-fiction and horror-story collections, \"The Martian Chronicles\" (1950), \"The Illustrated Man\" (1951), and \"I Sing the Body Electric\" (1969), Bradbury was one of the most celebrated 20th- and 21st-century American writers. While most of his best known work is in speculative fiction, he also wrote in other genres, such as the coming-of-age novel \"Dandelion Wine\" (1957) and the fictionalized memoir \"Green Shadows, White Whale\" (1992).\n\nRecipient of numerous awards, including a 2007 Pulitzer Citation, Bradbury also wrote and consulted on screenplays and television scripts, including \"Moby Dick\" and \"It Came from Outer Space\". Many of his works were adapted to comic book, television, and film formats.\n\nUpon his death in 2012, \"The New York Times\" called Bradbury \"the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream\".\n\nBradbury was born on August 22, 1920, in Waukegan, Illinois, to Esther (née Moberg) Bradbury (1888–1966), a Swedish immigrant, and Leonard Spaulding Bradbury (1890–1957), a power and telephone lineman of English ancestry. He was given the middle name \"Douglas\" after the actor Douglas Fairbanks. Bradbury was related to the American Shakespeare scholar Douglas Spaulding and descended from Mary Bradbury, who was tried at one of the Salem witch trials in 1692.\n\nBradbury was surrounded by an extended family during his early childhood and formative years in Waukegan. An aunt read him short stories when he was a child. This period provided foundations for both the author and his stories. In Bradbury's works of fiction, 1920s Waukegan becomes \"Green Town\", Illinois.\n\nThe Bradbury family lived in Tucson, Arizona, during 1926–1927 and 1932–1933 while their father pursued employment, each time returning to Waukegan. They eventually settled in Los Angeles in 1934 when Bradbury was 14 years old. The family arrived with only US$40, which paid for rent and food until his father finally found a job making wire at a cable company for $14 a week. This meant that they could stay, and Bradbury—who was in love with Hollywood—was ecstatic.\n\nBradbury attended Los Angeles High School and was active in the drama club. He often roller-skated through Hollywood in hopes of meeting celebrities. Among the creative and talented people Bradbury met were special-effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen and radio star George Burns. Bradbury's first pay as a writer, at age 14, was for a joke he sold to George Burns to use on the \" Burns and Allen\" radio show.\n\nThroughout his youth, Bradbury was an avid reader and writer and knew at a young age that he was \"going into one of the arts.\" Bradbury began writing his own stories at age 11 (1931), during the Great Depression — sometimes writing on the only available paper, butcher paper.\n\nIn his youth, he spent much time in the Carnegie library in Waukegan, reading such authors as H. G. Wells, Jules Verne, and Edgar Allan Poe. At 12, Bradbury began writing traditional horror stories and said he tried to imitate Poe until he was about 18. In addition to comics, he loved Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of \"Tarzan of the Apes\", especially Burroughs' John Carter of Mars series. \"The Warlord of Mars\" impressed him so much that at the age of 12, he wrote his own sequel. The young Bradbury was also a cartoonist and loved to illustrate. He wrote about Tarzan and drew his own Sunday panels. He listened to the radio show \"Chandu the Magician\", and every night when the show went off the air, he would sit and write the entire script from memory.\n\nAs a teen in Beverly Hills, he often visited his mentor and friend science-fiction writer Bob Olsen, sharing ideas and maintaining contact. In 1936, at a secondhand bookstore in Hollywood, Bradbury discovered a handbill promoting meetings of the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society. Excited to find there were others sharing his interest, Bradbury joined a weekly Thursday-night conclave at age 16.\n\nBradbury cited H. G. Wells and Jules Verne as his primary science-fiction influences. Bradbury identified with Verne, saying, \"He believes the human being is in a strange situation in a very strange world, and he believes that we can triumph by behaving morally\".\n\nIn young adulthood Bradbury read stories published in \"Astounding Science Fiction\", and read everything by Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, and the early writings of Theodore Sturgeon and A. E. van Vogt.\n\nThe family lived about four blocks from the Uptown Theater on Western Avenue in Los Angeles, the flagship theater for MGM and Fox. There, Bradbury learned how to sneak in and watched previews almost every week. He rollerskated there, as well as all over town, as he put it, \"hell-bent on getting autographs from glamorous stars. It was glorious.\" Among stars the young Bradbury was thrilled to encounter were Norma Shearer, Laurel and Hardy, and Ronald Colman. Sometimes, he spent all day in front of Paramount Pictures or Columbia Pictures and then skated to the Brown Derby to watch the stars who came and went for meals. He recounted seeing Cary Grant, Marlene Dietrich, and Mae West, whom he learned made a regular appearance every Friday night, bodyguard in tow.\n\nBradbury relates the following meeting with Sergei Bondarchuk, director of Soviet epic film series \"War and Peace\", at a Hollywood award ceremony in Bondarchuk's honor:\n\nBradbury's first published story was \"Hollerbochen's Dilemma\", which appeared in the January 1938 number of Forrest J. Ackerman's fanzine \"Imagination!\". In July 1939, Ackerman and his then-girlfriend Morojo gave 19-year-old Bradbury the money to head to New York for the First World Science Fiction Convention in New York City, and funded Bradbury's fanzine, titled \"Futuria Fantasia\". Bradbury wrote most of its four issues, each limited to under 100 copies. Between 1940 and 1947, he was a contributor to Rob Wagner's film magazine, \"Script\".\n\nBradbury was free to start a career in writing, when owing to his bad eyesight, he was rejected admission into the military during World War II. Having been inspired by science-fiction heroes such as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, Bradbury began to publish science-fiction stories in fanzines in 1938. Bradbury was invited by Forrest J. Ackerman to attend the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society, which at the time met at Clifton's Cafeteria in downtown Los Angeles. This was where he met the writers Robert A. Heinlein, Emil Petaja, Fredric Brown, Henry Kuttner, Leigh Brackett, and Jack Williamson.\n\nIn 1939, Bradbury joined Laraine Day's Wilshire Players Guild, where for two years, he wrote and acted in several plays. They were, as Bradbury later described, \"so incredibly bad\" that he gave up playwriting for two decades. Bradbury's first paid piece, \"Pendulum\", written with Henry Hasse, was published in the pulp magazine \"Super Science Stories\" in November 1941, for which he earned $15.\n\nBradbury sold his first story, \"The Lake\", for $13.75 at 22, and became a full-time writer by 24. His first collection of short stories, \"Dark Carnival\", was published in 1947 by Arkham House, a small press in Sauk City, Wisconsin, owned by writer August Derleth. Reviewing \"Dark Carnival\" for the \"New York Herald Tribune\", Will Cuppy proclaimed Bradbury \"suitable for general consumption\" and predicted that he would become a writer of the caliber of British fantasy author John Collier.\n\nAfter a rejection notice from the pulp \"Weird Tales\", Bradbury submitted \"Homecoming\" to \"Mademoiselle\", which was spotted by a young editorial assistant named Truman Capote. Capote picked the Bradbury manuscript from a slush pile, which led to its publication. \"Homecoming\" won a place in the O. Henry Award Stories of 1947.\n\nIn UCLA's Powell Library, in a study room with typewriters for rent, Bradbury wrote his classic story of a book burning future, \"The Fireman\", which was about 25,000 words long. It was later published at about 50,000 words under the name \"Fahrenheit 451\", for a total cost of $9.80, due to the library's typewriter-rental fees of ten cents per half-hour.\n\nA chance encounter in a Los Angeles bookstore with the British expatriate writer Christopher Isherwood gave Bradbury the opportunity to put \"The Martian Chronicles\" into the hands of a respected critic. Isherwood's glowing review followed.\n\nBradbury attributed two incidents to his lifelong habit of writing every day. The first of these, occurring when he was three years old, was his mother's taking him to see Lon Chaney's performance in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\". The second incident occurred in 1932, when a carnival entertainer, one Mr. Electrico, touched the young man on the nose with an electrified sword, made his hair stand on end, and shouted, \"Live forever!\" Bradbury remarked, \"I felt that something strange and wonderful had happened to me because of my encounter with Mr. Electrico...[he] gave me a future...I began to write, full-time. I have written every single day of my life since that day 69 years ago.\" At that age, Bradbury first started to do magic, which was his first great love. If he had not discovered writing, he would have become a magician.\n\nBradbury claimed a wide variety of influences, and described discussions he might have with his favorite poets and writers Robert Frost, William Shakespeare, John Steinbeck, Aldous Huxley, and Thomas Wolfe. From Steinbeck, he said he learned \"how to write objectively and yet insert all of the insights without too much extra comment\". He studied Eudora Welty for her \"remarkable ability to give you atmosphere, character, and motion in a single line\". Bradbury's favorite writers growing up included Katherine Anne Porter, who wrote about the American South, Edith Wharton, and Jessamyn West.\n\nBradbury was once described as a \"Midwest surrealist\" and is often labeled a science-fiction writer, which he described as \"the art of the possible.\" Bradbury resisted that categorization, however:\n\nBradbury recounted when he came into his own as a writer, the afternoon he wrote a short story about his first encounter with death. When he was a boy, he met a young girl at the beach and she went out into the water and never came back. Years later, as he wrote about it, tears flowed from him. He recognized he had taken the leap from emulating the many writers he admired to connecting with his voice as a writer.\n\nWhen later asked about the lyrical power of his prose, Bradbury replied, \"From reading so much poetry every day of my life. My favorite writers have been those who’ve said things well.\" He is quoted, \"If you're reluctant to weep, you won't live a full and complete life.\"\n\nIn high school, Bradbury was active in both the poetry club and the drama club, continuing plans to become an actor, but becoming serious about his writing as his high school years progressed. Bradbury graduated from Los Angeles High School, where he took poetry classes with Snow Longley Housh, and short-story writing courses taught by Jeannet Johnson. The teachers recognized his talent and furthered his interest in writing, but he did not attend college. Instead, he sold newspapers at the corner of South Norton Avenue and Olympic Boulevard. In regard to his education, Bradbury said:\nHe told \"The Paris Review\", \"You can't learn to write in college. It's a very bad place for writers because the teachers always think they know more than you do – and they don’t.\"\n\nBradbury described his inspiration as, \"My stories run up and bite me in the leg -- I respond by writing them down -- everything that goes on during the bite. When I finish, the idea lets go and runs off\".\n\nA reinvention of Waukegan, Green Town is a symbol of safety and home, which is often juxtaposed as a contrasting backdrop to tales of fantasy or menace. It serves as the setting of his semiautobiographical classics \"Dandelion Wine\", \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\", and \"Farewell Summer\", as well as in many of his short stories. In Green Town, Bradbury's favorite uncle sprouts wings, traveling carnivals conceal supernatural powers, and his grandparents provide room and board to Charles Dickens. Perhaps the most definitive usage of the pseudonym for his hometown, in \"Summer Morning, Summer Night\", a collection of short stories and vignettes exclusively about Green Town, Bradbury returns to the signature locale as a look back at the rapidly disappearing small-town world of the American heartland, which was the foundation of his roots.\n\nBradbury wrote many short essays on the culture and the arts, attracting the attention of critics in this field, but he used his fiction to explore and criticize his culture and society. Bradbury observed, for example, that \"Fahrenheit 451\" touches on the alienation of people by media:\nBradbury stated the novel worked as a critique of the later development of political correctness:\nIn a 1982 essay, he wrote, \"People ask me to predict the Future, when all I want to do is prevent it\". This intent had been expressed earlier by other authors, who sometimes attributed it to him.\n\nOn May 24, 1956, Bradbury appeared on television in Hollywood on the popular quiz show \"You Bet Your Life\" hosted by Groucho Marx. During his introductory comments and on-air banter with Marx, Bradbury briefly discussed some of his books and other works, including giving an overview of \"The Veldt\", his short story published six years earlier in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" under the title \"The World the Children Made\".\n\nBradbury was a consultant for the American Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair and for the original exhibit housed in Epcot's Spaceship Earth geosphere at Walt Disney World. Bradbury concentrated on detective fiction in the 1980s. In the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s, he also hosted \"The Ray Bradbury Theater\", a televised anthology series based on his short stories.\n\nBradbury was a strong supporter of public library systems, raising money to prevent the closure of several libraries in California facing budgetary cuts. He said \"libraries raised me\", and shunned colleges and universities, comparing his own lack of funds during the Depression with poor contemporary students. His opinion varied on modern technology. In 1985 Bradbury wrote, \"I see nothing but good coming from computers. When they first appeared on the scene, people were saying, 'Oh my God, I'm so afraid.' I hate people like that – I call them the neo-Luddites\", and \"In a sense, [computers] are simply books. Books are all over the place, and computers will be, too\". He resisted the conversion of his work into e-books, saying in 2010, \"We have too many cellphones. We've got too many internets. We have got to get rid of those machines. We have too many machines now\". When the publishing rights for \"Fahrenheit 451\" came up for renewal in December 2011, Bradbury permitted its publication in electronic form provided that the publisher, Simon & Schuster, allowed the e-book to be digitally downloaded by any library patron. The title remains the only book in the Simon & Schuster catalog where this is possible.\n\nSeveral comic-book writers have adapted Bradbury's stories. Particularly noted among these were EC Comics' line of horror and science-fiction comics. Initially, the writers plagiarized his stories, but a diplomatic letter from Bradbury about it led to the company paying him and negotiating properly licensed adaptations of his work. The comics featuring Bradbury's stories included \"Tales from the Crypt\", \"Weird Science\", \"Weird Fantasy\", \"Crime Suspenstories\", and \"Haunt of Fear\".\n\nBradbury remained an enthusiastic playwright all his life, leaving a rich theatrical legacy, as well as literary. Bradbury headed the Pandemonium Theatre Company in Los Angeles for many years and had a five-year relationship with the Fremont Centre Theatre in South Pasadena.\n\nBradbury is featured prominently in two documentaries related to his classic 1950s-1960s era: Jason V Brock's \"Charles Beaumont: The Life of Twilight Zone's Magic Man\", which details his troubles with Rod Serling, and his friendships with writers Charles Beaumont, George Clayton Johnson, and most especially his dear friend William F. Nolan, as well as Brock's \"The AckerMonster Chronicles!\", which delves into the life of former Bradbury agent, close friend, mega-fan, and \"Famous Monsters of Filmland\" editor Forrest J Ackerman.\n\nBradbury's legacy was celebrated by the bookstore Fahrenheit 451 Books in Laguna Beach, California, in the 1970s and 1980s. The grand opening of an annex to the store was attended by Bradbury and his favorite illustrator, Joseph Mugnaini, in the mid-1980s. The shop closed its doors in 1987, but in 1990, another shop with the same name (with different owners) opened in Carlsbad, California.\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s, Bradbury served on the advisory board of the Los Angeles Student Film Institute.\n\nBradbury was married to Marguerite McClure (January 16, 1922 – November 24, 2003) from 1947 until her death; they had four daughters: Susan, Ramona, Bettina, and Alexandra. Bradbury never obtained a driver's license, but relied on public transportation or his bicycle. He lived at home until he was 27 and married. His wife of 56 years, Maggie, as she was affectionately called, was the only woman Bradbury ever dated.\n\nHe was raised Baptist by his parents, who were themselves infrequent churchgoers. As an adult, Bradbury considered himself a \"delicatessen religionist\" who resisted categorization of his beliefs and took guidance from both Eastern and Western faiths. He felt that his career was \"a God-given thing, and I'm so grateful, so, so grateful. The best description of my career as a writer is 'At play in the fields of the Lord.'\"\n\nBradbury was a close friend of Charles Addams, and Addams illustrated the first of Bradbury's stories about the Elliotts, a family that resembled Addams' own Addams Family placed in rural Illinois. Bradbury's first story about them was \"Homecoming\", published in the 1946 Halloween issue of \"Mademoiselle\", with Addams' illustrations. Addams and he planned a larger collaborative work that would tell the family's complete history, but it never materialized, and according to a 2001 interview, they went their separate ways. In October 2001, Bradbury published all the Family stories he had written in one book with a connecting narrative, \"From the Dust Returned\", featuring a wraparound Addams cover of the original \"Homecoming\" illustration.\n\nAnother close friend was animator Ray Harryhausen, who was best man at Bradbury's wedding. During a BAFTA 2010 awards tribute in honor of Ray Harryhausen's 90th birthday, Bradbury spoke of his first meeting Harryhausen at Forrest J Ackerman's house when they were both 18 years old. Their shared love for science fiction, \"King Kong\", and the King Vidor-directed film \"The Fountainhead\", written by Ayn Rand, was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. These early influences inspired the pair to believe in themselves and affirm their career choices. After their first meeting, they kept in touch at least once a month, in a friendship that spanned over 70 years.\n\nLate in life, Bradbury retained his dedication and passion despite what he described as the \"devastation of illnesses and deaths of many good friends.\" Among the losses that deeply grieved Bradbury was the death of \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry, who was an intimate friend for many years. They remained close friends for nearly three decades after Roddenberry asked him to write for \"Star Trek\", which Bradbury never did, objecting that he \"never had the ability to adapt other people's ideas into any sensible form.\"\n\nBradbury suffered a stroke in 1999 that left him partially dependent on a wheelchair for mobility. Despite this, he continued to write, and had even written an essay for \"The New Yorker\", about his inspiration for writing, published only a week prior to his death. Bradbury made regular appearances at science-fiction conventions until 2009, when he retired from the circuit.\nBradbury chose a burial place at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, with a headstone that reads \"Author of Fahrenheit 451\". On February 6, 2015, \"The New York Times\" reported that the house that Bradbury lived and wrote in for 50 years of his life, at 10265 Cheviot Drive in Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, California, had been demolished by the buyer, architect Thom Mayne.\n\nBradbury died in Los Angeles, California, on June 5, 2012, at the age of 91, after a lengthy illness. Bradbury's personal library was willed to the Waukegan Public Library, where he had many of his formative reading experiences.\n\n\"The New York Times\" called Bradbury \"the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" credited Bradbury with the ability \"to write lyrically and evocatively of lands an imagination away, worlds he anchored in the here and now with a sense of visual clarity and small-town familiarity\". Bradbury's grandson, Danny Karapetian, said Bradbury's works had \"influenced so many artists, writers, teachers, scientists, and it's always really touching and comforting to hear their stories\". \"The Washington Post\" noted several modern day technologies that Bradbury had envisioned much earlier in his writing, such as the idea of banking ATMs and earbuds and Bluetooth headsets from \"Fahrenheit 451\", and the concepts of artificial intelligence within \"I Sing the Body Electric\".\n\nOn June 6, 2012, in an official public statement from the White House Press Office, President Barack Obama said:\n\nNumerous Bradbury fans paid tribute to the author, noting the influence of his works on their own careers and creations. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg stated that Bradbury was \"[his] muse for the better part of [his] sci-fi career... On the world of science fiction and fantasy and imagination he is immortal\". Writer Neil Gaiman felt that \"the landscape of the world we live in would have been diminished if we had not had him in our world\". Author Stephen King released a statement on his website saying, \"Ray Bradbury wrote three great novels and three hundred great stories. One of the latter was called 'A Sound of Thunder'. The sound I hear today is the thunder of a giant's footsteps fading away. But the novels and stories remain, in all their resonance and strange beauty.\"\n\nBradbury is credited with writing 27 novels and over 600 short stories. More than eight million copies of his works, published in over 36 languages, have been sold around the world.\n\nIn 1949, Bradbury and his wife were expecting their first child. He took a Greyhound bus to New York and checked into a room at the YMCA for 50 cents a night. He took his short stories to a dozen publishers and no one wanted them. Just before getting ready to go home, Bradbury had dinner with an editor at Doubleday. When Bradbury recounted that everyone wanted a novel and he did not have one, the editor, coincidentally named Walter Bradbury, asked if the short stories might be tied together into a book-length collection. The title was the editor's idea; he suggested, \"You could call it \"The Martian Chronicles\".\" Bradbury liked the idea and recalled making notes in 1944 to do a book set on Mars. That evening, he stayed up all night at the YMCA and typed out an outline. He took it to the Doubleday editor the next morning, who read it and wrote Bradbury a check for $750. When Bradbury returned to Los Angeles, he connected all the short stories that became \"The Martian Chronicles.\"\n\nWhat was later issued as a collection of stories and vignettes, \"Summer Morning, Summer Night\", started out to be Bradbury's first true novel. The core of the work was Bradbury's witnessing of the American small-town life in the American heartland.\n\nIn the winter of 1955–56, after a consultation with his Doubleday editor, Bradbury deferred publication of a novel based on Green Town, the pseudonym for his hometown. Instead, he extracted 17 stories and, with three other Green Town tales, bridged them into his 1957 book \"Dandelion Wine\". Later, in 2006, Bradbury published the original novel remaining after the extraction, and retitled it \"Farewell Summer\". These two titles show what stories and episodes Bradbury decided to retain as he created the two books out of one.\n\nThe most significant of the remaining unpublished stories, scenes, and fragments were published under the originally intended name for the novel, \"Summer Morning, Summer Night\", in 2007.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1954, 31 of Bradbury's stories were adapted by Al Feldstein for EC Comics (seven of them uncredited in six stories, including \"Kaleidoscope\" and \"Rocket Man\" being combined as \"Home To Stay\" - for which Bradbury was retroactively paid - and EC's first version of \"The Handler\" under the title \"A Strange Undertaking\") and 16 of these were collected in the paperbacks, \"The Autumn People\" (1965) and \"Tomorrow Midnight\" (1966), both published by Ballantine Books with cover illustrations by Frank Frazetta.\nAlso in the early 1950s, adaptations of Bradbury's stories were televised in several anthology shows, including \"Tales of Tomorrow\", \"Lights Out\", \"Out There\", \"Suspense\", \"CBS Television Workshop\", \"Jane Wyman's Fireside Theatre\", \"Star Tonight\", \"Windows\" and \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\". \"The Merry-Go-Round\", a half-hour film adaptation of Bradbury's \"The Black Ferris\", praised by \"Variety\", was shown on \"Starlight Summer Theater\" in 1954 and NBC's \"Sneak Preview\" in 1956. During that same period, several stories were adapted for radio drama, notably on the science fiction anthologies \"Dimension X\" and its successor \"X Minus One\".\n\nProducer William Alland first brought Bradbury to movie theaters in 1953 with \"It Came from Outer Space\", a Harry Essex screenplay developed from Bradbury's screen treatment \"Atomic Monster\". Three weeks later came the release of Eugène Lourié's \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\" (1953), which featured one scene based on Bradbury's \"The Fog Horn\", about a sea monster mistaking the sound of a fog horn for the mating cry of a female. Bradbury's close friend Ray Harryhausen produced the stop-motion animation of the creature. Bradbury later returned the favor by writing a short story, \"Tyrannosaurus Rex\", about a stop-motion animator who strongly resembled Harryhausen. Over the next 50 years, more than 35 features, shorts, and TV movies were based on Bradbury's stories or screenplays.\nBradbury was hired in 1953 by director John Huston to work on the screenplay for his film version of Melville's \"Moby Dick\" (1956), which stars Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab, Richard Basehart as Ishmael, and Orson Welles as Father Mapple. A significant result of the film was Bradbury's book \"Green Shadows, White Whale\", a semifictionalized account of the making of the film, including Bradbury's dealings with Huston and his time in Ireland, where exterior scenes that were set in New Bedford, Massachusetts, were filmed.\n\nBradbury's short story \"I Sing the Body Electric\" (from the book of the same name) was adapted for the 100th episode of \"The Twilight Zone\". The episode was first aired on May 18, 1962.\n\nIn 1965, three of Bradbury's stories were adapted for the stage. These included \"The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit\", \"The Day It Rained Forever\", and \"Device Out of Time\". The last was adapted from his 1957 novel \"Dandelion Wine\". The plays debuted at the Coronet Theater in Hollywood and featured Booth Coleman, Joby Baker, Fredric Villani, Arnold Lessing, Eddie Sallia, Keith Taylor, Richard Bull, Gene Otis Shane, Henry T. Delgado, F. Murray Abraham, Anne Loos, and Len Lesser. The director was Charles Rome Smith and the production company was Pandemonium Productions.\n\nOskar Werner and Julie Christie starred in \"Fahrenheit 451\" (1966), an adaptation of Bradbury's novel directed by François Truffaut.\n\nIn 1966, Bradbury helped Lynn Garrison create \"AVIAN\", a specialist aviation magazine. For the first issue, Bradbury wrote a poem, \"Planes That Land on Grass\".\n\nIn 1969, \"The Illustrated Man\" was brought to the big screen, starring Rod Steiger, Claire Bloom, and Robert Drivas. Containing the prologue and three short stories from the book, the film received mediocre reviews. The same year, Bradbury approached composer Jerry Goldsmith, who had worked with Bradbury in dramatic radio of the 1950s and later scored the film version, to compose a cantata \"Christus Apollo\" based on Bradbury's text. The work premiered in late 1969, with the California Chamber Symphony performing with narrator Charlton Heston at UCLA.\n\n\"The Martian Chronicles\" became a three-part TV miniseries starring Rock Hudson, which was first broadcast by NBC in 1980. Bradbury found the miniseries \"just boring\".\n\nThe 1982 television movie \"The Electric Grandmother\" was based on Bradbury's short story \"I Sing the Body Electric\".\n\nThe 1983 horror film \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\", starring Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce, is based on the Bradbury novel of the same name.\n\nIn 1984, Michael McDonough of Brigham Young University produced \"Bradbury 13\", a series of 13 audio adaptations of famous stories from Bradbury, in conjunction with National Public Radio. The full-cast dramatizations featured adaptations of \"The Ravine\", \"Night Call, Collect\", \"The Veldt\", \"There Was an Old Woman\", \"Kaleidoscope\", \"Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed\", \"The Screaming Woman\", \"A Sound of Thunder\", \"The Man\", \"The Wind\", \"The Fox and the Forest\", \"Here There Be Tygers\", and \"The Happiness Machine\". Voiceover actor Paul Frees provided narration, while Bradbury was responsible for the opening voiceover; Greg Hansen and Roger Hoffman scored the episodes. The series won a Peabody Award and two Gold Cindy awards, and was released on CD on May 1, 2010. The series began airing on BBC Radio 4 Extra on June 12, 2011.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1992, Bradbury hosted a syndicated anthology television series, \"The Ray Bradbury Theater\", for which he adapted 65 of his stories. Each episode began with a shot of Bradbury in his office, gazing over mementoes of his life, which he states (in narrative) are used to spark ideas for stories. During the first two seasons, Bradbury also provided additional voiceover narration specific to the featured story and appeared on screen.\n\nDeeply respected in the USSR, Bradbury's fiction has been adapted into five episodes of the Soviet science-fiction TV series \"This Fantastic World\" which adapted the stories film version of \"I Sing The Body Electric\", \"Fahrenheit 451\", \"A Piece of Wood\", \"To the Chicago Abyss\", and \"Forever and the Earth\". In 1984 a cartoon adaptation of There Will Come Soft Rains («Будет ласковый дождь») came out by Uzbek director Nazim Tyuhladziev. He made a film adaptation of \"The Veldt\" in 1987. In 1989, a cartoon adaptation of \"Here There Be Tygers\" («Здесь могут водиться тигры») by director Vladimir Samsonov came out.\n\nBradbury wrote and narrated the 1993 animated television version of \"The Halloween Tree\", based on his 1972 novel.\n\nThe 1998 film \"The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit\", released by Touchstone Pictures, was written by Bradbury. It was based on his story \"The Magic White Suit\" originally published in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" in 1957. The story had also previously been adapted as a play, a musical, and a 1958 television version.\n\nIn 2002, Bradbury's own Pandemonium Theatre Company production of \"Fahrenheit 451\" at Burbank's Falcon Theatre combined live acting with projected digital animation by the Pixel Pups. In 1984, Telarium released a game for Commodore 64 based on \"Fahrenheit 451\". Bradbury and director Charles Rome Smith co-founded Pandemonium in 1964, staging the New York production of \"The World of Ray Bradbury\" (1964), adaptations of \"The Pedestrian\", \"The Veldt\", and \"To the Chicago Abyss\".\n\nIn 2005, the film \"A Sound of Thunder\" was released, loosely based upon the short story of the same name. The film \"The Butterfly Effect\" revolves around the same theory as \"A Sound of Thunder\" and contains many references to its inspiration. Short film adaptations of \"A Piece of Wood\" and \"The Small Assassin\" were released in 2005 and 2007, respectively.\n\nIn 2005, it was reported that Bradbury was upset with filmmaker Michael Moore for using the title \"Fahrenheit 9/11\", which is an allusion to Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451\", for his documentary about the George W. Bush administration. Bradbury expressed displeasure with Moore's use of the title, but stated that his resentment was not politically motivated, though Bradbury was conservative-leaning politically. Bradbury asserted that he did not want any of the money made by the movie, nor did he believe that he deserved it. He pressured Moore to change the name, but to no avail. Moore called Bradbury two weeks before the film's release to apologize, saying that the film's marketing had been set in motion a long time ago and it was too late to change the title.\n\nIn 2008, the film \"Ray Bradbury's Chrysalis\" was produced by Roger Lay Jr. for Urban Archipelago Films, based upon the short story of the same name. The film won the best feature award at the International Horror and Sci-Fi Film Festival in Phoenix. The film has international distribution by Arsenal Pictures and domestic distribution by Lightning Entertainment.\n\nIn 2010, \"The Martian Chronicles\" was adapted for radio by \"Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air\".\n\nBradbury's works and approach to writing are documented in Terry Sanders' film \"Ray Bradbury: Story of a Writer\" (1963).\n\nBradbury's poem \"Groon\" was voiced as a tribute in 2012.\n\nThe Ray Bradbury Award for excellency in screenwriting was occasionally presented by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America – presented to six people on four occasions from 1992 to 2009. Beginning 2010, the Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation is presented annually according to Nebula Awards rules and procedures, although it is not a Nebula Award. The revamped Bradbury Award replaced the Nebula Award for Best Script.\n\n\nBradbury appeared in the documentary \"The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal\" (1985), produced and directed by Arnold Leibovit.\n\n\n"}

Sarshar has attempted to describe the tumultuous and unique life of Mohammad in the novel. Muslims believe that Mohammad was the last prophet and the most complete human being. \"That Which That Orphan Saw\" has received numerous awards and has been reprinted many times in Iran. The idea for writing the novel came to Sarshar in 1980 because he believed that there were no valuable life stories about Mohammad available for teenagers. The 8th reprinting was published in May 2013.\n\nThe book was translated to English by James C. Klark.\n\nThe first part of \"That Which That Orphan Saw\" starts with dream of Abdul-Muttalib in which he is ordered to dig the Zamzam Well. He finds the place to dig near Mecca which he about heard in his dream. The Quraysh are against digging the well and ask Abdul-Muttalib not to do this. Finally they agree to visit a priest and accept his judgement. The priest lives outside of Mecca. Some of the Quraysh head towards the place of the priest along with Abdul-Muttalib. They miss the way and come across a difficult situation so that they let Abdul-Muttalib dig the well. Abdul-Muttalib finds a treasure while digging the well. The Quraysh tribe believe that the treasure belongs to all of them and so they decide to equitably share each part of the treasure. The 8th reprinting was published in May 2013.\n\nAnother notable point in this part of the book is the importance of having sons from the viewpoint of the families; and that Abdul-Muttalib wished to have many sons in order to protect himself from the invasions. When, after years his dream comes true he decides to sacrifice one of his sons based on his covenant with God. His dearest son, Abdullah is chosen by chance to be sacrificed. When he tries to sacrifice his son they prohibit him and advise him to visit a priestess, as a neutral person, and accept her judgement.\n\nThe priestess tells them to choose the sacrifice between Abdullah and certain number of camels by chance and increase the number of the camels by ten if Abdullah is chosen firstly. \"Repeat this up to the time the camels are chosen\", the priestess says. Abdul-Muttalib acts on the recommendation of the priestess and finally kills 300 camels and Abdullah survives.\nAbdullah marries a woman and she gives birth to a son. He moves towards Sham and becomes sick near Yathrib and passes away in Yathrib. Consequently, Mohammad is born without a father.\nThe promised prophet of the apocalypse is mentioned in different parts of the book.\nThis book published to Urdo, Arabic and Turkish.

Ames studied art and architecture at Harvard University. He worked in the publishing business before turning to a career in the theatre. In 1911, Ames married Lucy (Fuller) Cabot in London, and the couple had two daughters named Catherine and Joan.\n\nIn 1904, Ames toured Europe to study the management techniques of sixty opera and theatre companies. Upon his return to America, he became manager of Boston's Castle Square Theatre. In 1908, he was appointed as the managing director of the New Theatre, at Central Park West and 62nd Street in New York. In November 1909, the theatre opened officially to the public with an opulent production of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" starring Julia Marlowe and E. H. Sothern. The New Theatre was the largest playhouse in New York City at that time, and Ames began to mount ambitious productions, ranging from Shakespeare and other classics to modern works. The theatre was a financial failure and closed after only two seasons.\n\nIn 1912, bucking the tide of Broadway commercialism, Ames used his own money to build the Little Theatre at 240 West 44th Street with the express idea of putting on experimental dramas and to give an opportunity to new playwrights. This theatre had 300 seats and was, at the time, the smallest legitimate theatre in New York. One of the plays he presented in October of the first year of operation was \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", which he billed as the \"First play written entirely for the enjoyment of children.\" Ames wrote the play under the pseudonym \"Jessie Graham White\" from the stories of the Brothers Grimm. The play received favorable reviews. He also built the Booth Theatre on West 45th Street in 1913 and managed both the Little Theatre and the Booth until 1930.\n\nAmes's most notable Broadway productions included an adaptation of \"Prunella\" (1913), \"The Philanderer\" (1913), \"A Pair of Silk Stockings\" (1914), and \"Pierrot the Prodigal\" (1916). During World War I, Ames organized the Over There Theatre League, which arranged for actors to travel to Europe to entertain troops.\n\nAfter the war, Ames began to direct most of the Broadway shows that he produced, including \"The Betrothal\" (1918), \"The Green Goddess\" (1921), \"The Truth About Blayds\" (1922), \"Will Shakespeare\" (1923), \"Beggar on Horseback\" (1924), \"Minick\" (1924), \"Old English\" (1924), \"White Wings\" (1926), \"Escape\" (1927), \"The Merchant of Venice\" (1928) and \"Mrs. Moonlight\" (1930).\n\nBy the 1920s, after the extraordinary success of the Gilbert and Sullivan works in America at the end of the nineteenth century, the popularity of Gilbert and Sullivan had waned. Ames revived interest in these comic operas with lavish and lively seasons of \"Iolanthe\", \"The Pirates of Penzance\" and \"The Mikado\" from 1926 to 1929. Ames directed the productions himself at the Booth Theatre, which received critical praise. These paved the way for American tours by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in the 1930s. \"TIME\" magazine wrote of Ames' production of \"Iolanthe\": \"It is generally agreed that in this entertainment he has done the best job of any producer attempting one of the famous series in our time. The only anxiety now is that he may be distracted before he has revived everyone of the operas in an equally felicitous vein... The show is now accepted as incomparably the finest musical preparation of its type in town, and probably in the world.\n\nIn the 1920s, Ames began leasing his theatres to other producers, and he produced his last Broadway play in 1930. In 1931, as he wound down his business affairs with age and poor health, he sold the Little Theatre building to \"The New York Times\". In 1959, the theatre was converted back to a theatre and was briefly renamed in 1964 as the \"Winthrop Ames Theatre\", and in 1983 it was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. In 1932, Ames left New York to retire to North Easton, but there he helped to found the Cambridge School of Drama. In 1929, he was elected a trustee of Harvard and in 1936 became vice president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters.\n\nIn addition to writing his children's adaptation of \"Snow White\" in 1913, Ames was commissioned by the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation to write the screenplay for their 1916 motion pictures \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Snow White\". He also translated \"The Merchant of Paris\" from the French in 1930 and wrote other plays.\n\nAmes died of pneumonia in 1937 in Boston three weeks before his 67th birthday and was buried in North Easton. Like other influential Broadway theater producers, Ames's likeness was captured in caricature by Alex Gard for the wall of Sardi's, the New York City Theater District restaurant. The picture is now part of the collection of the New York Public Library.\n\nAmes was inducted, posthumously, into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981.\n\n\n"}
