{"id": "3823822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3823822", "title": "Achille Talon", "text": "Achille Talon\n\nAchille Talon is a Franco-Belgian comics series featuring an eponymous main character, created by Greg (the pseudonym of Michel Regnier). Starting publication in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \"Pilote\" in 1963, the series presents the comic misadventures of an anti-hero.\n\nThe name derives from \"talon d'Achille\", the French term for an \"Achilles' heel\", which suits the character although the Achilles' heel of Achille Talon is not his heel but his large nose.\n\nThe first \"Achille Talon\" gag was published in \"Pilote\" on November 7, 1963. After several years of gags and increasing popularity, \"Achille Talon\" became a dedicated magazine of its own, starting publication on October 1, 1975. Not achieving the intended success, the magazine ceased publication after one year, producing only six issues. The album series has produced 46 volumes. Achille Talon is presented in two quite different formats: there are album length stories such as \"Achille Talon et la main du serpent\" (\"Achille Talon and the Serpent's Hand\"), a 44-page story, as well as albums with only gags that run one or two pages each. Regardless of format, Achille Talon would typically first appear a couple pages at a time in the weekly magazine \"Pilote\", then be collected later for hardcover or softcover books.\n\nAchille Talon is a \"bourgeois\" who likes to think he's an eloquent (others say voluble) intellectual. He is vain to the extent that he builds a giant statue of himself in his front garden and desperately tries to get on the good side of the local gentry. That being said, Achille Talon is a gentleman, an intrepid traveler and an animal lover. He values etiquette and sometimes resorts to activism (e.g., pro peace or against pollution) or inventions. He is often at odds with his neighbour Hilarion Lefuneste, who loves to argue too. (In French, \"le funeste\" means \"the grievous/fateful one\" suggesting any dealings with him will have negative consequences.)\n\nA man in his forties, Achille is single and lives at home with his parents. His father, Alambic Dieudonné Corydon Talon, is a beer-fanatic, while his mother, unnamed but always \"maman\", is a strong, earthy, loving bourgeois housewife. He never tires of the attentions of the aristocratic Virgule de Guillemets, who brings sophistication to his life.\n\nAchille Talon can be courageous and magnanimous, a protector of animals and ever vigilant guardian of proper etiquette, so much so that he fights with an author of an etiquette book — over which of them has the honour of giving the right of way. He is a patron of the arts (as long as he is the one portrayed) and briefly a wise, though ostensibly tyrannical, head of state.\n\nOn a page verbal and visual humor are usually mixed, although sometimes the humour is strictly visual, sometimes mostly verbal. The visual humor is often from exaggeration (phones often do not simply ring, but explode), however occasionally it is subtle and understated (a factory spewing out toxic fumes, bearing a sign \"Gourmet Foods\", or a funnel in the soil of an overflowing pot, where watering with any tool could hardly miss).\n\nThe verbal humour usually consists of long rants, in which internal inconsistencies, puns and sheer nonsense are cleverly interspersed. Of course, Achille Talon is almost invariably proven wrong and ends up being the butt of the joke.\n\n\nIn 1981, Dargaud Canada translated \"Le Trésor de Virgule\" into English as \"Magnesia's Treasure\". Achille Talon was translated into \"Walter Melon\", presumably a pun on \"watermelon\". The paperback volume included two features not included in the French original: a page introducing the characters (similar to the opening of \"Asterix\" books), and a humorous three page illustrated essay on Greg and the publishing industry in general. The back cover is the familiar picture of Talon leaning out of a newsstand snagging Lefuneste, with a small inset with a photograph of Greg titled \"AUTHOR AND GENIUS\", followed by a quote \"SUCCESS DID NOT SPOIL ME. I WAS BORN SPOILED.\"\n\nA television series of fifty-two twenty-six-minute episodes was made for Canal+ in 1996 by Saban International Paris. Each episode is broken up into two short stories. It was broadcast in France for the first time on September 3, 1997, in the television show \"C + Cléo\" on Canal+.\n\nThe animated series is very different from the original comic. In the animated cartoon, Talon is a very awkward superhero who offers his heroic services for hire, replacing such characters as Luke Skywalker, Zorro and Tarzan when they become indisposed. Talon manages to make justice triumph by pure luck. The series was renamed \"Walter Melon\" for English-speaking television. The English version was broadcast on the Fox Family Channel.\n\n\n\"Le Trésor de Virgule\" (1977) was published in English as \"Magnesia's Treasure\" in 1981.\n\n"}
{"id": "524917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524917", "title": "Airstream mechanism", "text": "Airstream mechanism\n\nIn phonetics, the airstream mechanism is the method by which airflow is created in the vocal tract. Along with phonation and articulation, it is one of three main components of speech production. The airstream mechanism is mandatory for sound production and constitutes the first part of this process, which is called initiation.\n\nThe organ generating the airstream is called the \"initiator\" and there are three initiators used in spoken human languages:\n\nThough not used in any language, the cheeks may be used to generate the airstream \"(buccal\" mechanism, notated {ↀ} in VoQS). See buccal speech.\n\nAfter a laryngectomy, the esophagus may be used as the initiator (notated {Œ} for simple esophageal speech and {Ю} for tracheo-esophageal speech in VoQS). See esophageal speech.\n\n\"Percussive\" consonants are produced without any airstream mechanism.\n\nAny of the three initiators − diaphragm, glottis or tongue − may act by either increasing or decreasing the pressure generating the airstream. These changes in pressure often correspond to outward and inward airflow, and are therefore termed \"egressive\" and \"ingressive\" respectively.\n\nOf these six resulting airstream mechanisms, four are found lexically around the world:\n\nThese mechanisms may be combined into airstream contours, such as clicks which release into ejectives.\n\nThe Khoisan languages have pulmonic, ejective, and click consonants, the Chadic languages have pulmonic, implosive, and ejective consonants, and the Nguni languages utilize all four, pulmonic, click, implosive, and ejective, in normal vocabulary. Most other languages utilize only one or two airstream mechanisms.\n\nIn interjections, the other two mechanisms may be employed. For example, in countries as diverse as Sweden, Turkey, and Togo, a pulmonic ingressive (\"gasped\" or \"inhaled\") vowel is used for back-channeling or to express agreement, and in France a lingual egressive (a \"spurt\") is used to express dismissal. The only language where such sounds are known to be contrastive in normal vocabulary is the extinct ritual language Damin (also the only language outside Africa with clicks); however, Damin appears to have been intentionally designed to differ from normal speech.\n\nInitiation by means of the lungs (actually the diaphragm and ribs) is called pulmonic initiation. The vast majority of sounds used in human languages are pulmonic egressives. In most languages, including all the languages of Europe (excluding the Caucasus), all phonemes are pulmonic egressives.\n\nThe only attested use of a phonemic pulmonic ingressive is a lateral fricative in Damin, a ritual language formerly used by speakers of Lardil in Australia. This can be written with the extended version of the International Phonetic Alphabet as . !Xóõ has ingression as a phonetic detail in one series of its clicks, which are \"ingressive voiceless nasals with delayed aspiration\", . Peter Ladefoged considers these to be among the most difficult sounds in the world. Other languages, for example in Taiwan, have been claimed to have pulmonic ingressives, but these claims have either proven to be spurious or to be occasional phonetic detail.\n\nIn interjections, but not in normal words, pulmonic ingressive vowels or words occur on all continents. This is commonly done for back-channeling (as with in Ewe) or affirmation (as with in Swedish). In English, an audible intake of breath, , or an indrawn consonant such as or is used in a conversation to indicate that someone is about to speak or is preparing to continue speaking. In some languages, such as Finnish and Amharic, entire phrases may be uttered with an ingressive airstream. (See ingressive sound.)\n\nIt is possible to initiate airflow in the upper vocal tract by means of the vocal cords or glottis. This is known as glottalic initiation.\n\nFor egressive glottalic initiation, one lowers the glottis (as if to sing a low note), closes it as for a glottal stop, and then raises it, building up pressure in the oral cavity and upper trachea. Glottalic egressives are called ejectives. The glottis must be fully closed to form glottalic egressives, or the air column would flow backwards over it; it is therefore impossible to pronounce voiced ejectives. Ejective allophones of voiceless stops occur in many varieties of English at the ends of intonation units.\n\nFor ingressive glottalic initiation, the sequence of actions performed in glottalic pressure initiation is reversed:  one raises the glottis (as if to sing a high note), closes it, and then lowers it to create suction in the upper trachea and oral cavity. Glottalic ingressives are called implosives, although they may involve zero airflow rather than actual inflow. Because the air column would flow forwards over the descending glottis, it is not necessary to fully close it, and implosives may be voiced; indeed, voiceless implosives are exceedingly rare.\n\nIt is usual for implosives to be voiced. Instead of keeping the glottis tightly closed, it is tensed but left slightly open to allow a thin stream of air through. Unlike pulmonic voiced sounds, in which a stream of air passes through a usually-fixed glottis, in voiced implosives a mobile glottis passes over a nearly motionless air column to cause vibration of the vocal cords. Phonations that are more open than modal voice, such as breathy voice, are not conducive to glottalic sounds because in these the glottis is held relatively open, allowing air to readily flow through and preventing a significant pressure difference from building up behind the articulator.\n\nBecause the oral cavity is so much smaller than the lungs, vowels and approximants cannot be pronounced with glottalic initiation. So-called glottalized vowels and other sonorants use the more common pulmonic egressive airstream mechanism.\n\nThere is no clear divide between pulmonic and glottalic sounds. Some languages may have consonants which are intermediate. For example, glottalized consonants in London English, such as the \"t\" in \"rat\" , may be weakly ejective. Similarly, fully voiced stops in languages such as Thai, Zulu, and Maidu are weakly implosive. This ambiguity does not occur with the next airstream mechanism, lingual, which is clearly distinct from pulmonic sounds.\n\nThe third form of initiation in human language is lingual or velaric initiation, where a sound is produced by a closure at two places of articulation, and the airstream is formed by movement of the body of the tongue. Lingual stops are more commonly known as clicks, and are almost universally ingressive. The word \"lingual\" is derived from Latin \"lingua\", which means tongue.\n\nTo produce a lingual ingressive airstream, first close the vocal tract at two places: at the back of the tongue, as in a velar or uvular stop, and simultaneously with the front of the tongue or the lips, as in a coronal or bilabial stop. These holds may be voiceless, voiced, or nasalized. Then lower the body of the tongue to rarefy the air above it. The closure at the front of the tongue is opened first, as the click \"release\"; then the closure at the back is released for the pulmonic or glottalic click \"accompaniment\" or \"efflux\". This may be aspirated, affricated, or even ejective. Even when not ejective, it is not uncommon for the glottis to be closed as well, for a triply articulated consonant, and this third closure is released last to produce a glottalized click. Clicks are found in very few languages, notably the Khoisan languages of southern Africa and some nearby tongues such as Zulu. They are more often found in extra-linguistic contexts, such as the \"tsk tsk\" sound many Westerners use to express regret or pity (a dental click), or the clucking noise used by many equestrians to urge on their horses (a lateral click).\n\nLingual egressive initiation is performed by reversing the sequence of a lingual ingressive: the front and back of the tongue (or lips and back of the tongue) seal off the vocal cavity, and the cheeks and middle of the tongue move inward and upward to increase oral pressure. The only attested use of a lingual egressive is a bilabial nasal egressive click in Damin. Transcribing this also requires the use of the Extended IPA, .\n\nSince the air pocket used to initiate lingual consonants is so small, it is not thought to be possible to produce lingual fricatives, vowels, or other sounds which require continuous airflow.\n\nClicks may be voiced, but they are more easily nasalized. This may be because the vocal cavity behind the rearmost closure, behind which the air passing through the glottis for voicing must be contained, is so small that clicks cannot be voiced for long. Allowing the airstream to pass through the nose enables a longer production.\n\nNasal clicks involve a combination of lingual and pulmonic mechanisms. The velum is lowered so as to direct pulmonic airflow through the nasal cavity during the lingual initiation. This nasal airflow may itself be egressive or ingressive, independently of the lingual initiation of the click. Nasal clicks may be voiced, but are very commonly unvoiced and even aspirated, which is rare for purely pulmonic nasals.\n\nIn some treatments, complex clicks are posited to have airstream contours, in which the airstream changes between the front (click) and rear (non-click) release. There are two attested types: Linguo-pulmonic consonants, where the rear release is a uvular obstruent such as or ; and linguo-glottalic consonants, where the rear release is an ejective such as or . Theoretically, a release into an implosive should be possible, but both clicks and dorsal implosives () are rare (the latter because they are difficult to pronounce), and no language is known to combine them.\n\nConsonants may be pronounced without any airstream mechanism. These are \"percussive\" consonants, where the sound is generated by one organ striking another. Percussive consonants are not phonemic in any known language, though the extensions to the IPA for disordered speech provide symbols for a bilabial percussive (smacking lips) and a bidental percussive (gnashing teeth). The only percussive known to be used in nondisordered speech is a sublingual percussive (a tongue slap) that appears allophonically in the release of alveolar clicks in the Sandawe language of Tanzania.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=864", "title": "Andy Warhol", "text": "Andy Warhol\n\nAndy Warhol (; born Andrew Warhola; August 6, 1928 – February 22, 1987) was an American artist, director and producer who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture, and advertising that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening, photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings \"Campbell's Soup Cans\" (1962) and \"Marilyn Diptych\" (1962), the experimental film \"Chelsea Girls\" (1966), and the multimedia events known as the \"Exploding Plastic Inevitable\" (1966–67).\n\nBorn and raised in Pittsburgh, Warhol initially pursued a successful career as a commercial illustrator. After exhibiting his work in several galleries in the late 1950s, he began to receive recognition as an influential and controversial artist. His New York studio, The Factory, became a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy patrons. He promoted a collection of personalities known as Warhol superstars, and is credited with coining the widely used expression \"15 minutes of fame.\" In the late 1960s, he managed and produced the experimental rock band The Velvet Underground and founded \"Interview\" magazine. He authored numerous books, including \"The Philosophy of Andy Warhol\" and \"\". He lived openly as a gay man before the gay liberation movement. After gallbladder surgery, Warhol died of cardiac arrhythmia in February 1987 at the age of 58.\n\nWarhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibitions, books, and feature and documentary films. The Andy Warhol Museum in his native city of Pittsburgh, which holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives, is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. The highest price ever paid for a Warhol painting is US$105 million for a 1963 canvas titled \"Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)\"; his works include some of the most expensive paintings ever sold. A 2009 article in \"The Economist\" described Warhol as the \"bellwether of the art market\".\n\nWarhol was born on August 6, 1928, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the fourth child of Ondrej Warhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola, Sr., 1889–1942) and Julia (\"née\" Zavacká, 1892–1972), whose first child was born in their homeland and died before their move to the U.S.\n\nHis parents were working-class Lemko emigrants from Mikó, Austria-Hungary (now called Miková, located in today's northeastern Slovakia). Warhol's father emigrated to the United States in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death of Warhol's grandparents. Warhol's father worked in a coal mine. The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The family was Ruthenian Catholic and attended St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church. Andy Warhol had two older brothers—Pavol (Paul), the oldest, was born before the family emigrated; Ján was born in Pittsburgh. Pavol's son, James Warhola, became a successful children's book illustrator.\n\nIn third grade, Warhol had Sydenham's chorea (also known as St. Vitus' Dance), the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a complication of scarlet fever which causes skin pigmentation blotchiness. At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.\n\nAs a teenager, Warhol graduated from Schenley High School in 1945. Also as a teen, Warhol won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award. After graduating from high school, his intentions were to study art education at the University of Pittsburgh in the hope of becoming an art teacher, but his plans changed and he enrolled in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where he studied commercial art. During his time there, Warhol joined the campus Modern Dance Club and Beaux Arts Society. He also served as art director of the student art magazine, \"Cano\", illustrating a cover in 1948 and a full-page interior illustration in 1949. These are believed to be his first two published artworks. Warhol earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in pictorial design in 1949. Later that year, he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising.\n\nWarhol's early career was dedicated to commercial and advertising art, where his first commission had been to draw shoes for \"Glamour\" magazine in the late 1940s. In the 1950s, Warhol worked as a designer for shoe manufacturer Israel Miller. American photographer John Coplans recalled that\n\nnobody drew shoes the way Andy did. He somehow gave each shoe a temperament of its own, a sort of sly, Toulouse-Lautrec kind of sophistication, but the shape and the style came through accurately and the buckle was always in the right place. The kids in the apartment [which Andy shared in New York – note by Coplans] noticed that the vamps on Andy's shoe drawings kept getting longer and longer but [Israel] Miller didn't mind. Miller loved them.\n\nWarhol's \"whimsical\" ink drawings of shoe advertisements figured in some of his earliest showings at the Bodley Gallery in New York.\n\nWarhol was an early adopter of the silk screen printmaking process as a technique for making paintings. A young Warhol was taught silk screen printmaking techniques by Max Arthur Cohn at his graphic arts business in Manhattan. While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his \"blotted line\" technique, applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a printmaking process on the most rudimentary scale. His use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme, a method that prefigures his 1960s silk-screen canvas. In his book \"\", Warhol writes: \"When you do something exactly wrong, you always turn up something.\"\n\nWarhol habitually used the expedient of tracing photographs projected with an epidiascope. Using prints by Edward Wallowitch, his 'first boyfriend' the photographs would undergo a subtle transformation during Warhol's often cursory tracing of contours and hatching of shadows. Warhol used Wallowitch's photograph \"Young Man Smoking a Cigarette\" (c.1956), for a 1958 design for a book cover he submitted to Simon and Schuster for the Walter Ross pulp novel \"The Immortal\", and later used others for his dollar bill series, and for \"Big Campbell's Soup Can with Can Opener (Vegetable)\", of 1962 which initiated Warhol's most sustained motif, the soup can.\n\nWith the rapid expansion of the record industry, RCA Records hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials.\n\nHe began exhibiting his work during the 1950s. He held exhibitions at the Hugo Gallery and the Bodley Gallery in New York City; in California, his first West Coast gallery exhibition was on July 9, 1962, in the Ferus Gallery of Los Angeles. The exhibition marked his West Coast debut of pop art.\nAndy Warhol's first New York solo pop art exhibition was hosted at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery November 6–24, 1962. The exhibit included the works \"Marilyn Diptych\", \"100 Soup Cans\", \"100 Coke Bottles\", and \"100 Dollar Bills\". At the Stable Gallery exhibit, the artist met for the first time poet John Giorno who would star in Warhol's first film, \"Sleep\", in 1963.\n\nIt was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, mushroom clouds, electric chairs, Campbell's Soup Cans, Coca-Cola bottles, celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Marlon Brando, Troy Donahue, Muhammad Ali, and Elizabeth Taylor, as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking African-American protesters during the Birmingham campaign in the civil rights movement. During these years, he founded his studio, \"The Factory\" and gathered about him a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. His work became popular and controversial. Warhol had this to say about Coca-Cola:\n\nNew York City's Museum of Modern Art hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists such as Warhol were attacked for \"capitulating\" to consumerism. Critics were scandalized by Warhol's open embrace of market culture. This symposium set the tone for Warhol's reception.\n\nA pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit \"The American Supermarket\", a show held in Paul Bianchini's Upper East Side gallery. The show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by six prominent pop artists of the time, among them the controversial (and like-minded) Billy Apple, Mary Inman, and Robert Watts. Warhol's painting of a can of Campbell's soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for $6. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.\n\nAs an advertisement illustrator in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was Gerard Malanga. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculpture, and other works at \"The Factory\", Warhol's aluminum foil-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol's Factory crowd included Freddie Herko, Ondine, Ronald Tavel, Mary Woronov, Billy Name, and Brigid Berlin (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).\n\nDuring the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of bohemian and counterculture eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation \"Superstars\", including Nico, Joe Dallesandro, Edie Sedgwick, Viva, Ultra Violet, Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis, and Candy Darling. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer John Giorno and film-maker Jack Smith, also appear in Warhol films (many premiering at the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre and 55th Street Playhouse) of the 1960s, revealing Warhol's connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. Less well known was his support and collaboration with several teen-agers during this era, who would achieve prominence later in life including writer David Dalton, photographer Stephen Shore and artist Bibbe Hansen (mother of pop musician Beck).\n\nOn June 3, 1968, radical feminist writer Valerie Solanas shot Warhol and Mario Amaya, art critic and curator, at Warhol's studio. Before the shooting, Solanas had been a marginal figure in the Factory scene. She authored in 1967 the \"S.C.U.M. Manifesto\", a separatist feminist tract that advocated the elimination of men; and appeared in the 1968 Warhol film \"I, a Man\". Earlier on the day of the attack, Solanas had been turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to Warhol. The script had apparently been misplaced.\n\nAmaya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day. Warhol was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived: surgeons opened his chest and massaged his heart to help stimulate its movement again. He suffered physical effects for the rest of his life, including being required to wear a surgical corset. The shooting had a profound effect on Warhol's life and art.\n\nSolanas was arrested the day after the assault, after turning herself in to police. By way of explanation, she said that Warhol \"had too much control over my life.\" She was subsequently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and eventually sentenced to three years under the control of the Department of Corrections. After the shooting, the Factory scene heavily increased security, and for many the \"Factory 60s\" ended.\n\nWarhol had this to say about the attack: \"Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television.\"\n\nCompared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s, the 1970s were a much quieter decade, as he became more entrepreneurial. According to Bob Colacello, Warhol devoted much of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait commissions—including Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, his wife Empress Farah Pahlavi, his sister Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, Mick Jagger, Liza Minnelli, John Lennon, Diana Ross, and Brigitte Bardot. Warhol's famous portrait of Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong was created in 1973. He also founded, with Gerard Malanga, \"Interview\" magazine, and published \"The Philosophy of Andy Warhol\" (1975). An idea expressed in the book: \"Making money is art, and working is art and good business is the best art.\"\n\nWarhol socialized at various nightspots in New York City, including Max's Kansas City; and, later in the 1970s, Studio 54. He was generally regarded as quiet, shy, and a meticulous observer. Art critic Robert Hughes called him \"the white mole of Union Square.\"\n\nIn 1979, along with his longtime friend Stuart Pivar, Warhol founded the New York Academy of Art.\n\nWarhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the \"bull market\" of 1980s New York art: Jean-Michel Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, David Salle and other so-called Neo-Expressionists, as well as members of the Transavantgarde movement in Europe, including Francesco Clemente and Enzo Cucchi. Before the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics, he teamed with 15 other artists, including David Hockney and Cy Twombly, and contributed a Speed Skater print to the Art and Sport collection. The Speed Skater was used for the official Sarajevo Winter Olympics poster.\n\nBy this time, graffiti artist Fab Five Freddy paid homage to Warhol when he painted an entire train with Campbell soup cans. This was instrumental in Freddy becoming involved in the underground NYC art scene and becoming an affiliate of Basquiat.\n\nBy this period, Warhol was being criticized for becoming merely a \"business artist\". In 1979, reviewers disliked his exhibits of portraits of 1970s personalities and celebrities, calling them superficial, facile and commercial, with no depth or indication of the significance of the subjects. They also criticized his 1980 exhibit of 10 portraits at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan, entitled \"Jewish Geniuses\", which Warhol—who was uninterested in Judaism and Jews—had described in his diary as \"They're going to sell.\" In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as \"the most brilliant mirror of our times,\" contending that \"Warhol had captured something irresistible about the zeitgeist of American culture in the 1970s.\"\n\nWarhol also had an appreciation for intense Hollywood glamour. He once said: \"I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They're so beautiful. Everything's plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic.\"\n\nIn 1984, Warhol immortalized the singer Prince by creating one of his final portraits, \"Orange Prince (1984)\", a commission from Vanity Fair to accompany an article to celebrate the success of Prince's album and movie entitled \"Purple Rain\". Referencing the many celebrity portraits produced by Warhol across his career, \"Orange\" \"Prince (1984)\" was created using a similar composition to the Marilyn \"Flavors\" series from 1962, among some of Warhol's very first celebrity portraits. Prince is depicted in a pop color palette commonly used by Warhol, in bright orange with highlights of bright green and blue. The facial features and hair are screen-printed in black over the orange background.\n\nIn the \"Andy Warhol Diaries\", Warhol recorded how excited he was to see Prince and Billy Idol together at a party in the mid 1980s, and he compared them to the Hollywood movie stars of the 1950s and '60s who also inspired his portraits: \"... seeing these two glamour boys, its like \"boys\" are the new Hollywood glamour girls, like Jean Harlow and Marilyn Monroe\".\n\nBy the beginning of the 1960s, pop art was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as Roy Lichtenstein, would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the \"Pope of Pop\", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from cartoons and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as Willem de Kooning). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bronwit Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist and Robert Rauschenberg had also once graced.\nIt was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhol's dollar paintings. On November 23, 1961, Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, \"Pop, The Genius of Warhol\", was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter. For his first major exhibition, Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell's soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life. A 1964 \"Large Campbell's Soup Can\" was sold in a 2007 Sotheby's auction to a South American collector for £5.1 million ($7.4 million).\n\nHe loved celebrities, so he painted them as well. From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used silk-screening; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.\n\nIn 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group-4 race version of the then \"elite supercar\" BMW M1 for the fourth installment in the BMW Art Car Project. It was reported at the time that, unlike the three artists before him, Warhol opted to paint directly onto the automobile himself instead of letting technicians transfer his scale-model design to the car. It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car.\n\nWarhol produced both comic and serious works; his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques—silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors—whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962–63 \"Death and Disaster\" series. The \"Death and Disaster\" paintings included \"Red Car Crash\", \"Purple Jumping Man\", and \"Orange Disaster.\" One of these paintings, the diptych \"Silver Car Crash\", became the highest priced work of his when it sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction on Wednesday, November 13, 2013, for $105.4 million.\n\nSome of Warhol's work, as well as his own personality, has been described as being Keatonesque. Warhol has been described as playing dumb to the media. He sometimes refused to explain his work. He has suggested that all one needs to know about his work is \"already there 'on the surface'.\"\n\nHis Rorschach inkblots are intended as pop comments on art and what art could be. His cow wallpaper (literally, wallpaper with a cow motif) and his oxidation paintings (canvases prepared with copper paint that was then oxidized with urine) are also noteworthy in this context. Equally noteworthy is the way these works—and their means of production—mirrored the atmosphere at Andy's New York \"Factory\". Biographer Bob Colacello provides some details on Andy's \"piss paintings\":\n\nWarhol's first portrait of \"Basquiat\" (1982) is a black photo-silkscreen over an oxidized copper \"piss painting\".\n\nAfter many years of silkscreen, oxidation, photography, etc., Warhol returned to painting with a brush in hand in a series of more than 50 large collaborative works done with Jean-Michel Basquiat between 1984 and 1986. Despite negative criticism when these were first shown, Warhol called some of them \"masterpieces,\" and they were influential for his later work.\n\nAndy Warhol was commissioned in 1984 by collector and gallerist Alexander Iolas to produce work based on Leonardo da Vinci's \"The Last Supper\" for an exhibition at the old refectory of the Palazzo delle Stelline in Milan, opposite from the Santa Maria delle Grazie where Leonardo da Vinci's mural can be seen. Warhol exceeded the demands of the commission and produced nearly 100 variations on the theme, mostly silkscreens and paintings, and among them a collaborative sculpture with Basquiat, the \"Ten Punching Bags (Last Supper)\".\nThe Milan exhibition that opened in January 1987 with a set of 22 silk-screens, was the last exhibition for both the artist and the gallerist. The series of \"The Last Supper\" was seen by some as \"arguably his greatest,\" but by others as \"wishy-washy, religiose\" and \"spiritless.\" It is the largest series of religious-themed works by any U.S. artist.\n\nArtist Maurizio Cattelan describes that it is difficult to separate daily encounters from the art of Andy Warhol: \"That's probably the greatest thing about Warhol: the way he penetrated and summarized our world, to the point that distinguishing between him and our everyday life is basically impossible, and in any case useless.\" Warhol was an inspiration towards Cattelan's magazine and photography compilations, such as \"Permanent Food, Charley\", and \"Toilet Paper\".\n\nIn the period just before his death, Warhol was working on \"Cars\", a series of paintings for Mercedes-Benz.\n\nA self-portrait by Andy Warhol (1963–64), which sold in New York at the May Post-War and Contemporary evening sale in Christie's, fetched $38.4 million.\n\nOn May 9, 2012, his classic painting \"Double Elvis (Ferus Type)\" sold at auction at Sotheby's in New York for US$33 million. With commission, the sale price totaled US$37,042,500, short of the $50 million that Sotheby's had predicted the painting might bring. The piece (silkscreen ink and spray paint on canvas) shows Elvis Presley in a gunslinger pose. It was first exhibited in 1963 at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. Warhol made 22 versions of the \"Double Elvis\", nine of which are held in museums.\n\nIn November 2013, his \"Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)\" diptych sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction for $105.4 million, a new record for the pop artist (pre-auction estimates were at $80 million). Created in 1963, this work had rarely been seen in public in the previous years. In November 2014, \"Triple Elvis\" sold for $81.9m (£51.9m) at an auction in New York.\n\nWarhol worked across a wide range of media—painting, photography, drawing, and sculpture. In addition, he was a highly prolific filmmaker. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films, plus some 500 short black-and-white \"screen test\" portraits of Factory visitors. One of his most famous films, \"Sleep\", monitors poet John Giorno sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film \"Blow Job\" is one continuous shot of the face of DeVeren Bookwalter supposedly receiving oral sex from filmmaker Willard Maas, although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, \"Empire\" (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the Empire State Building in New York City at dusk. The film \"Eat\" consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes. Warhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by LaMonte Young called \"Trio for Strings\" and subsequently created his famous series of static films including \"Kiss\", \"Eat\", and \"Sleep\" (for which Young initially was commissioned to provide music). Uwe Husslein cites filmmaker Jonas Mekas, who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, and who claims Warhol's static films were directly inspired by the performance.\n\n\"Batman Dracula\" is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of DC Comics. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the \"Batman\" series, Warhol's movie was an \"homage\" to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly campy Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary \"Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis\".\n\nWarhol's 1965 film \"Vinyl\" is an adaptation of Anthony Burgess' popular dystopian novel \"A Clockwork Orange\". Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as Brigid Berlin, Viva, Edie Sedgwick, Candy Darling, Holly Woodlawn, Ondine, Nico, and Jackie Curtis. Legendary underground artist Jack Smith appears in the film \"Camp\".\n\nHis most popular and critically successful film was \"Chelsea Girls\" (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two 16 mm-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that \"story\" while it was lowered for the other. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol's seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s.\n\nWarhol was a fan of filmmaker Radley Metzger film work and commented that Metzger's film, \"The Lickerish Quartet\", was \"an outrageously kinky masterpiece\". \"Blue Movie\"—a film in which Warhol superstar Viva makes love in bed with Louis Waldon, another Warhol superstar—was Warhol's last film as director. The film, a seminal film in the Golden Age of Porn, was, at the time, controversial for its frank approach to a sexual encounter. \"Blue Movie\" was publicly screened in New York City in 2005, for the first time in more than 30 years.\n\nAfter his June 3, 1968, shooting, a reclusive Warhol relinquished his personal involvement in filmmaking. His acolyte and assistant director, Paul Morrissey, took over the film-making chores for the Factory collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie exploitation fare with \"Flesh\", \"Trash\", and \"Heat\". All of these films, including the later \"Andy Warhol's Dracula\" and \"Andy Warhol's Frankenstein\", were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter \"Warhol\" films starred Joe Dallesandro—more of a Morrissey star than a true Warhol superstar.\n\nIn the early 1970s, most of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol's death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.\n\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Warhol adopted the band the Velvet Underground, making them a crucial element of the Exploding Plastic Inevitable multimedia performance art show. Warhol, with Paul Morrissey, acted as the band's manager, introducing them to Nico (who would perform with the band at Warhol's request). While managing The Velvet Underground, Andy would have them dressed in all black to perform in front of movies that he was also presenting. In 1966 he \"produced\" their first album \"The Velvet Underground & Nico\", as well as providing its album art. His actual participation in the album's production amounted to simply paying for the studio time. After the band's first album, Warhol and band leader Lou Reed started to disagree more about the direction the band should take, and their artistic friendship ended. In 1989, after Warhol's death, Reed and John Cale re-united for the first time since 1972 to write, perform, record and release the concept album \"Songs for Drella\", a tribute to Warhol.\n\nWarhol designed many album covers for various artists starting with the photographic cover of John Wallowitch's debut album, \"This Is John Wallowitch!!!\" (1964). He designed the cover art for The Rolling Stones' albums \"Sticky Fingers\" (1971) and \"Love You Live\" (1977), and the John Cale albums \"The Academy in Peril\" (1972) and \"Honi Soit\" in 1981. One of Warhol's last works was a portrait of Aretha Franklin for the cover of her 1986 gold album \"Aretha\", which was done in the style of the \"Reigning Queens\" series he had completed the year before.\n\nWarhol strongly influenced the new wave/punk rock band Devo, as well as David Bowie. Bowie recorded a song called \"Andy Warhol\" for his 1971 album \"Hunky Dory\". Lou Reed wrote the song \"Andy's Chest\", about Valerie Solanas, the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the \"VU\" album in 1985. Bowie would later play Warhol in the 1996 movie, \"Basquiat\". Bowie recalled how meeting Warhol in real life helped him in the role, and recounted his early meetings with him:\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work.\n\nThe first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was \"25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy\", printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs. The original edition was limited to 190 numbered, hand colored copies, using Dr. Martin's ink washes. Most of these were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends. Copy No. 4, inscribed \"Jerry\" on the front cover and given to Geraldine Stutz, was used for a facsimile printing in 1987, and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US $35,000 by Doyle New York.\n\nOther self-published books by Warhol include:\n\nWarhol's book \"A La Recherche du Shoe Perdu\" (1955) marked his \"transition from commercial to gallery artist\". (The title is a play on words by Warhol on the title of French author Marcel Proust's \"À la recherche du temps perdu\".)\n\nAfter gaining fame, Warhol \"wrote\" several books that were commercially published:\n\nWarhol created the fashion magazine \"Interview\" that is still published today. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces.\n\nAlthough Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he authored works in many different media.\n\nHe founded the gossip magazine \"Interview\", a stage for celebrities he \"endorsed\" and a business staffed by his friends. He collaborated with others on all of his books (some of which were written with Pat Hackett.) He adopted the young painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, and the band The Velvet Underground, presenting them to the public as his latest interest, and collaborating with them. One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian \"Superstar\" and the Warholian portrait). He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from \"Love Boat\" to \"Saturday Night Live\" and the Richard Pryor movie \"Dynamite Chicken\").\n\nIn this respect Warhol was a fan of \"Art Business\" and \"Business Art\"—he, in fact, wrote about his interest in thinking about art as business in \"The Philosophy of Andy Warhol from A to B and Back Again\".\n\nWarhol was gay. Interviewed in 1980, he indicated that he was still a virgin—biographer Bob Colacello who was present at the interview felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably \"a mixture of voyeurism and masturbation—to use [Andy's] word \"abstract\"\". Warhol's assertion of virginity would seem to be contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease. It has also been contradicted by his lovers, including Warhol muse BillyBoy who has said they had sex to orgasm: \"When he wasn't being Andy Warhol and when you were just alone with him he was an incredibly generous and very kind person. What seduced me was the Andy Warhol who I saw alone. In fact when I was with him in public he kind of got on my nerves….I'd say: 'You're just obnoxious, I can't bear you.\" Asked if Warhol was only a voyeur, Billy Name also denied it, saying: \"He was the essence of sexuality. It permeated everything. Andy exuded it, along with his great artistic creativity….It brought a joy to the whole art world in New York.\" \"But his personality was so vulnerable that it became a defense to put up the blank front.\" Warhol's lovers included John Giorno, Billy Name, Charles Lisanby, and Jon Gould. His boyfriend of 12 years was Jed Johnson, whom he met in 1968, and who later achieved fame as an interior designer.\n\nThe fact that Warhol's homosexuality influenced his work and shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and is an issue that Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications (\"e.g.\", \"Popism: The Warhol 1960s\"). Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of Liza Minnelli, Judy Garland, and Elizabeth Taylor, and films such as \"Blow Job\", \"My Hustler\" and \"Lonesome Cowboys\") draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters, including the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre and 55th Street Playhouse, in the late 1960s.\n\nThe first works that Warhol submitted to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay.' In \"Popism\", furthermore, the artist recalls a conversation with the film maker Emile de Antonio about the difficulty Warhol had being accepted socially by the then-more-famous (but closeted) gay artists Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. De Antonio explained that Warhol was \"too swish and that upsets them.\" In response to this, Warhol writes, \"There was nothing I could say to that. It was all too true. So I decided I just wasn't going to care, because those were all the things that I didn't want to change anyway, that I didn't think I 'should' want to change  ... Other people could change their attitudes but not me\". In exploring Warhol's biography, many turn to this period—the late 1950s and early 1960s—as a key moment in the development of his persona. Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like \"Um, no\" and \"Um, yes\", and often allowing others to speak for him)—and even the evolution of his pop style—can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.\n\nWarhol was a practicing Ruthenian Catholic. He regularly volunteered at homeless shelters in New York City, particularly during the busier times of the year, and described himself as a religious person. Many of Warhol's later works depicted religious subjects, including two series, \"Details of Renaissance Paintings\" (1984) and \"The Last Supper\" (1986). In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.\n\nDuring his life, Warhol regularly attended Liturgy, and the priest at Warhol's church, Saint Vincent Ferrer, said that the artist went there almost daily, although he was not observed taking Communion or going to Confession and sat or knelt in the pews at the back. The priest thought he was afraid of being recognized; Warhol said he was self-conscious about being seen in a Roman Rite church crossing himself \"in the Orthodox way\" (right to left instead of the reverse).\n\nHis art is noticeably influenced by the Eastern Christian tradition which was so evident in his places of worship.\n\nWarhol's brother has described the artist as \"really religious, but he didn't want people to know about that because [it was] private\". Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol's eulogy John Richardson depicted it as devout: \"To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one conversion. He took considerable pride in financing his nephew's studies for the priesthood\".\n\nWarhol was an avid collector. His friends referred to his numerous collections, which filled not only his four-story townhouse, but also a nearby storage unit, as \"Andy's Stuff.\" The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his \"Stuff.\"\n\nWarhol's collections included a Coca-cola memorabilia sign, and 19th century paintings along with airplane menus, unpaid invoices, pizza dough, pornographic pulp novels, newspapers, stamps, supermarket flyers, and cookie jars, among other eccentricities. It also included significant works of art, such as George Bellows's \"Miss Bentham\". One of his main collections was his wigs. Warhol owned more than 40 and felt very protective of his hairpieces, which were sewn by a New York wig-maker from hair imported from Italy. In 1985 a girl snatched Warhol's wig off his head. It was later discovered in Warhol's diary entry for that day that he wrote: \"I don't know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony.\"\n\nAnother item found in Warhol's boxes at the museum in Pittsburgh was a mummified human foot from Ancient Egypt. The curator of anthropology at Carnegie Museum of Natural History felt that Warhol most likely found it at a flea market.\n\nWarhol died in Manhattan at 6:32 a.m. on February 22, 1987 at age 58. According to news reports, he had been making a good recovery from gallbladder surgery at New York Hospital before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative irregular heartbeat. Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors. His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and water intoxication. The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.\n\nShortly before Warhol's death, doctors expected Warhol to survive the surgery, though a revaluation of the case about thirty years after his death showed many indications that Warhol's surgery was in fact riskier than originally thought. It was widely reported at the time that Warhol died of a \"routine\" surgery, though when considering factors such as his age, a family history of gallbladder problems, his previous gunshot wounds, and his medical state in the weeks leading up to the procedure, the potential risk of death following the surgery appeared to have been significant.\n\nWarhol's brothers took his body back to Pittsburgh, where an open-coffin wake was held at the Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home. The solid bronze casket had gold-plated rails and white upholstery. Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, a platinum wig, and sunglasses. He was laid out holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral liturgy was held at the Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church on Pittsburgh's North Side. The eulogy was given by Monsignor Peter Tay. Yoko Ono and John Richardson were speakers. The coffin was covered with white roses and asparagus ferns. After the liturgy, the coffin was driven to St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery in Bethel Park, a south suburb of Pittsburgh.\n\nAt the grave, the priest said a brief prayer and sprinkled holy water on the casket. Before the coffin was lowered, Paige Powell dropped a copy of \"Interview\" magazine, an \"Interview\" T-shirt, and a bottle of the Estee Lauder perfume \"Beautiful\" into the grave. Warhol was buried next to his mother and father. A memorial service was held in Manhattan for Warhol on April 1, 1987, at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York.\n\nWarhol's will dictated that his entire estate—with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members—would go to create a foundation dedicated to the \"advancement of the visual arts\". Warhol had so many possessions that it took Sotheby's nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than US$20 million.\n\nIn 1987, in accordance with Warhol's will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts began. The foundation serves as the estate of Andy Warhol, but also has a mission \"to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process\" and is \"focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature.\"\n\nThe Artists Rights Society is the U.S. copyright representative for the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts for all Warhol works with the exception of Warhol film stills. The U.S. copyright representative for Warhol film stills is the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. Additionally, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts has agreements in place for its image archive. All digital images of Warhol are exclusively managed by Corbis, while all transparency images of Warhol are managed by Art Resource.\n\nThe Andy Warhol Foundation released its \"20th Anniversary Annual Report\" as a three-volume set in 2007: Vol. I, 1987–2007; Vol. II, Grants & Exhibitions; and Vol. III, Legacy Program. The Foundation remains one of the largest grant-giving organizations for the visual arts in the U.S.\n\nMany of Warhol's works and possessions are on display at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. The foundation donated more than 3,000 works of art to the museum.\n\nWarhol appeared as himself in the film \"Cocaine Cowboys\" (1979) and in the film \"Tootsie\" (1982).\n\nAfter his death, Warhol was portrayed by Crispin Glover in Oliver Stone's film \"The Doors\" (1991), by David Bowie in Julian Schnabel's film \"Basquiat\" (1996), and by Jared Harris in Mary Harron's film \"I Shot Andy Warhol\" (1996).\n\nWarhol appears as a character in Michael Daugherty's opera \"Jackie O\" (1997). Actor Mark Bringleson makes a brief cameo as Warhol in \"\" (1997).\n\nMany films by avant-garde cineast Jonas Mekas have caught the moments of Warhol's life. Sean Gregory Sullivan depicted Warhol in the film \"54\" (1998). Guy Pearce portrayed Warhol in the film \"Factory Girl\" (2007) about Edie Sedgwick's life. Actor Greg Travis portrays Warhol in a brief scene from the film \"Watchmen\" (2009).\n\nIn the movie \"Highway to Hell\" a group of Andy Warhols are part of the \"Good Intentions Paving Company\" where good-intentioned souls are ground into pavement.\n\nIn the film \"Men in Black 3\" (2012) Andy Warhol turns out to really be undercover MIB Agent W (played by Bill Hader). Warhol is throwing a party at The Factory in 1969, where he is looked up by MIB Agents K and J (J from the future). Agent W is desperate to end his undercover job (\"I'm so out of ideas I'm painting soup cans and bananas, for Christ sakes!\", \"You gotta fake my death, okay? I can't listen to sitar music anymore.\" and \"I can't tell the girls from the boys.\").\n\nAndy Warhol (portrayed by Tom Meeten) is one of main characters of the 2012 British television show \"Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy\". The character is portrayed as having robot-like mannerisms.\n\nIn the 2017 feature \"The Billionaire Boys Club\" Cary Elwes portrays Warhol in a film based on the true story about Ron Levin (portrayed by Kevin Spacey) a friend of Warhol's who was murdered in 1986.\n\nIn September 2016, it was announced that Jared Leto would portray the title character in \"Warhol\", an upcoming American biographical drama film produced by Michael De Luca and written by Terence Winter, based on the book \"Warhol: The Biography\" by Victor Bockris.\n\n\n\nIn 2002, the U.S. Postal Service issued an 18-cent stamp commemorating Warhol. Designed by Richard Sheaff of Scottsdale, Arizona, the stamp was unveiled at a ceremony at The Andy Warhol Museum and features Warhol's painting \"Self-Portrait, 1964\". In March 2011, a chrome statue of Andy Warhol and his Polaroid camera was revealed at Union Square in New York City.\n\n\n\n"}

It aired on July 8, 2008. It was written by \"Life on Mars\" creator Matthew Graham, and filmed in the City of Bath. A small amount of the episode, as with the following episodes, relies on a flashback to the time that the archaeologists are studying.\n\n\nThe episode is set in the City of Bath, and Gillian Magwilde and her team have been called out to a building site, after builders found Arabian dirhems buried in the site. After being told off briefly by Ben Ergha, Vivian Davis is revealed to be the student archaeologist studying with the team. Gillian has a cold, snubbing attitude towards Viv in the beginning, telling her to simply get on with some cataloguing. But after further inspection of the computerised earth scanner, Viv notices that there is more to the dig site.\n\nGillian and the rest of the team proceed to excavate the second place, now distinctly forming a crucifix shape when looked at from above. Before long, a skeleton is found, with more dirhems scattered around. This leads to much speculation, as the crusades happened in the Holy Land, not in England.\n\nBefore long, however, Gillian and Ben have to leave to go to the launching of a book written by the head of the archaeology department, Daniel Mastiff, entitled \"Sex Rites of the Ancients\". After a few witty remarks on Gillian's part, the two head back to the dig site.\n\nMeanwhile, however, Viv has been looking through the earth, when she finds a 13th-century sandal, and proceeds to show it to the hospice nurse that she has been talking to. The nurse quickly points out another mound, and after inspection, they both proceed to pull a cut of wood out. A splinter from the wood gets stuck in the nurse's finger, as Viv takes the wood back to the lab.\n\nAfter Gregory \"Dolly\" Parton completes a test on a scrap of material, the body found is revealed to be a Knight Templar, due to the distinct red cross revealed by the UV light. This raises further questions about Templars in England, with the only explanation being the exile of the Knights by King Philip I of France.\n\nViv gives Gillian the piece of wood that she found, and after sending Ben to do a dendrochronology test on it, the rest of the team discuss what could have happened. Before serious speculation took place, however, the dendrochronology test was complete, with the wood dating back to 32AD, and with blood soaked into it with metallic traces. Thoughts arise here about whether the wood could be part of the True Cross.\n\nMeanwhile, two Christian fanatics named Jack and Colm prepare themselves with swords for what they call a 'war', and make their way to a mosque, where they pray to God in the sunlight. Four young Muslims enter the building, and after Jack threatens to kill them with his sword, they run away. Jack and Colm leave the place.\n\nWhile Viv is looking for spare clothes for Gillian, she finds a piece of paper on the back of a picture of Gillian's mother, which has a picture of a sword on it.

She is a professor in the humanities and in the departments of Germanic languages and literature and comparative literature at New York University, where she co-directs the trauma and violence transdisciplinary studies program. As Jacques Derrida Professor of Philosophy, she teaches at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee. She has written about such topics as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; Alexander Graham Bell and the telephone; the structure of the test in legal, pharmaceutical, artistic, scientific, Zen, and historical domains; stupidity; the disappearance of authority; childhood; and deficiency. Ronell is a founding editor of the journal \"Qui Parle\" and a member of Jewish Voice for Peace.\n\nAn 11-month investigation at New York University determined that Ronell sexually harassed a graduate student, and the university suspended her without pay for the 2018–2019 academic year.\nAvital Ronell was born in Prague to Israeli diplomats and was a performance artist before entering academia. She emigrated to New York in 1956. She attended Rutgers Preparatory School and graduated in 1970. As a young immigrant, Ronell later stated, she frequently encountered xenophobia and anti-Semitism. She earned a Bachelor of Arts from Middlebury College, and subsequently studied with Jacob Taubes and Hans-Georg Gadamer at the Hermeneutic Institute at the Free University of Berlin. She received her doctorate of philosophy in German studies at Princeton University in 1979, where her advisor was Stanley Corngold and her dissertation concerned self-reflection in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Hölderlin, and Franz Kafka. When she met Jacques Derrida at a symposium and he asked her name, she introduced herself as \"Metaphysics\", and he later wrote that he \"found this little game rather clever.\" She subsequently studied with Derrida and Hélène Cixous in Paris. She went on to help introduce Derrida to American audiences by translating his essay on Kafka's \"Before the Law\", his essay on the law of gender/genre, his lectures on Nietzsche's relation to biography, and a number of other works. Ronell became a close friend of poet and novelist Pierre Alféri, who later influenced Ronell in the titling of several of her major works.\n\nA professor at the University of Virginia for a short time period, Ronell claims she was fired because she taught continental philosophy and \"went to the gym on a regular basis: [her] colleagues were shocked by this—it didn't correspond to their image of an academic woman!\" She joined the comparative literature faculty at the University of California, Riverside and then at University of California, Berkeley where she taught with Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Jean-Luc Nancy and Judith Butler. She was a close friend of the writer Kathy Acker and identified with Acker's fiction, saying they were \"destined to each other.\" In 1996, she moved to New York University, where she co-taught a course with Jacques Derrida until 2004.\n\nIn 2009, the Centre Pompidou invited Ronell to hold an interview series with such artists and thinkers as Werner Herzog, Judith Butler, Dennis Cooper, Jean-Luc Nancy, and Suzanne Doppelt. Also in 2009, she began co-teaching courses with Slavoj Žižek. In 2010, François Noudelmann also co-taught with her, and co-curated the Walls and Bridges program with her in 2011.\n\nRonell served as Chair to the Division of Philosophy and Literature and to the Division of Comparative Literature at the Modern Language Association from 1993 to 1996, and gave a keynote address at the annual meeting of the American Comparative Literature Association in 2012.\n\nRonell argues for the necessity of the unintelligible. In an account of the 1992 Rodney King beating, which Bruce Hainley reviewed in \"Artforum\" in 1994 as \"the most illuminating essay on TV and video ever written\", Ronell argued that the idiom of the \"perfectly clear\" recurrently serves as a code for the white lie. Instead of referring to herself as the author of a text, she has sometimes described herself as a \"signatory,\" \"operator,\" or even \"television.\" She sometimes focuses on thinkers who clean up after other thinkers, arguing that what she calls \"sanitation departments\" sometimes undermine the work they are tidying up after.\n\nIn 1983, she wrote one of the first critical inquiries to theorize the AIDS crisis.\n\nRonell investigates one of Goethe's most influential works, \"Conversations with Eckermann\", which he did not write but instead dictated to a young schizoid companion, Johannes Peter Eckermann. Heralded by Nietzsche as \"the best German book,\" \"Conversations with Eckermann\" contains Goethe's last thoughts about art, poetry, politics, religion, and the fate of German literature and philosophy. Ronell reads \"Conversations with Eckermann\" as a return from beyond the grave of the great master of German literature and science.\n\nRonell starts by exploring Goethe's focus on \"a certain domain of immateriality—the nonsubstantializable apparitions ... [of] weather forecasting ... ghosts, dreams, and some forms of hidden, telepathic transmissions.\" Ronell renames the Goethe-effect what she calls \"killer texts\" and describes the effect as the textual machination destructive of values, of the \"worthier (\"Werther\", from \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\").\" The first part opens on Freud's debt to Goethe and reprints the frontispiece of \"The Psychopathology of Everyday Life.\" Ronell names Goethe the \"secret councilor (\"Geheimrat\")\" of Freud and already anticipates her work on the Rat Man in the third footnote where she alludes to the \"suppository logic, inserting the vital element into the narrative of the other.\" In the first section Ronell aims to \"attune [her] ears to the telepathic orders that Goethe's phantom transmitted to Freud by a remote control system.\n\nIn general, \"Dictations: On Haunted Writing\" traces the closure without end of influence's computation. Ronell's task entails a reading practice where the analysis of a text must investigate the endless movement towards closure in dictation. Ronell thus practices what is called anasemic reading, a practice developed by Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok, in which the psychoanalyst traces the textual metaphors, rhetorical structures, and linguistic associations of a writer/patient.\n\n\"Part Two\" presents a case of literary parasitism between Eckermann and Goethe, and opens at the scene of Goethe's table in Weimar \"the eleventh of September 1828, at two o'clock.\" In other words, Ronell re-imagines the scene that Eckermann illustrates at the beginning and ending of \"Conversations with Eckermann\". Ronell starts to address the fiction of the writer as a particularly admirable human being and argues for the necessary passivity of the writer as a human being. Ronell also troubles the notion of a body of work as a totality. Ronell remaps earlier arguments about feminine appropriation in terms of writing, for Eckermann, which \"involves recuperating something 'for myself,' for the most part instinctively; it entails repetitive acts of appropriation.\"\n\n\"Dictations: On Haunted Writing\" explores how the work of writing in general adheres to a call dictated from elsewhere, a call formative of desire.\n\nRonell questions the operations that such ordinary objects as the telephone and book dictate. She signs the text as the operator of the switchboard alongside Richard Eckersley, operator of design, and Michael Jensen, operator of compositor. Eckersley's design departs from his \"typographic subtlety and restraint\" towards a computer design, marked by new page-making software programs to interpret the text typographically. Eckersley dislodges the text from presumed conventional settings and shifts the focus of reading with inexplicable gaps, displacements between sentences and paragraphs, mirror imaging of pages facing one another, words blurred to the point of indecipherability, and a regular exaggeration of negative line spacing, spilling sentences over into each other. Pushing the limits of an ordinary \"Table of Contents\" or \"Footnotes,\" the operators set up a \"Directory Assistance,\" in which chapters appear as reference indexes, and a yellow pages entitled \"Classified,\" in which footnotes appear as soliciting advertisements.\n\nFollowing \"A User's Manual,\" the text begins as if the reader answers a call: \"And yet, you're saying yes, almost automatically, suddenly, sometimes irreversibly.\" Ronell makes clear that \"The Telephone Book\" is a philosophical project on questions concerning the telephone, the call, and the answering machines: \"always incomplete, always unreachable, forever promising at once its essence and its existence, philosophy identifies itself finally with this promise, which is to say, with its own unreachability.\"\n\nRonell takes as her point of departure Nietzsche's articulation that, as long as culture has existed, it has supported and inspired addiction. Often untimely, she develops an argument investigative of the destructive desires that coincide with the war on drugs and with the very addiction to drugs which the war claims to want to vanquish. The result is a text whose performance disturbs simple comprehension and frustrates any reading that wishes to tackle drugs on one side or another of a binary opposition. Ronell appeals to literature as the most advanced testimony to the culture of addiction and closely reads \"Madame Bovary\".\n\nPrior to the title page, Ronell showcases quotes from Martin Heidegger, Gustave Flaubert and Samuel Beckett. The text opens with a series of sixteen \"hits\" informative of both the structure of doing drugs and of the structure of cultural transmission. The \"hits\" serve as a series of references which survey the literary and philosophical landscape as relates to drugs. \"Toward a Narcoanalysis\" consolidates the text's itinerary to an account of the sort of analysis Ronell begins to explore by appealing to Gustave Flaubert's \"Madame Bovary\". \"EB on Ice\" performs a first-person account where Ronell complicates the certitude with which the reader can identify the first-person narrator as herself, as EB, or being on ice as being in the refrigerator, as being on methamphetamine. \"Shame\" highlights something like the downsizing of interpretation as it only occupies eight pages and draws the reader's attention to the possibility that the text experiments with the potential indifference between drugs and texts. \"Scoring Literature\" makes up the largest portion of the text and includes nineteen subsections along with a \"Doctor's Report\" of E. Bovary. \"Cold Turkey: or, The Transcendental Aesthetic to be Eaten\" is formatted as three installations, three nano-installations, and two nano-intervals of a theatrical play where Ronell convokes Ernst Jünger, Martin Heidegger, Jacques Derrida, Marguerite Faust, Marguerite Duras, Freud, Irma, Voice Off, Nietzsche, Saint Theresa, Emma B, Walter Benjamin, chorus, priest, and delusions of a non-addict.\n\nResearch assistant and friend, Shireen R.K. Patell, helped bring \"Finitude's Score\" to fruition. \"Finitude's Score\" collects a series of reflections on the fragile memory left at the close of the millennium. It looks into the projects responsible for devastating humanity and a thinking of the future. Ronell asks why the twentieth century stakes so much on a diction of deficiency. For Ronell, it says that, \"we have been depleted.\" Ronell traces the relegitimization of war, the philosophical status of the rumor, the questionable force of the police, the test sites of technology, the corporeal policies of disease and a thoroughgoing reconstitution of the subject of law. In sum, \"Finitude's Score\" reads the desire to finish once and for all, to be done with issues definitively, as the everlasting legacy of the Western logos.\n\nRonell breaks down stupidity. In particular, she unfolds the complex problematic of stupidity as something that baffles knowledge in general, and therefore as something that especially baffles knowledge about itself. Among other considerations, Ronell finds that stupidity often takes the form of mastery and intelligence's doubles. She further goes to show that stupidity does not acquire the status of concept. It only reaches the level of quasi-concept.\n\nInflected in the title and throughout the work is the concept of the Freudian drive as it inheres in the test. At the limit of the test as that which grounds scientific knowledge, Ronell questions the distinction between the literary and human sciences as this distinction depends upon the constitutive limits of fiction and witnessing. Her work thus questions the structure of the test as it functions to legitimate everything from research to love and trauma.\n\nRonell's work has been both praised and criticized. In 1994, the journal \"Diacritics\" published a special edition \"On the Work of Avital Ronell\", in which Jonathan Culler wrote: \"Over the past decade, Ronell has put together what must be one of the most remarkable critical oeuvres of our era ... Zeugmatically yoking the slang of pop culture with philosophical analysis, forcing the confrontation of high literature and technology or drug culture, Avital Ronell produces sentences that startle, irritate, illuminate. At once hilarious and refractory, her books are like no others.\" Judith Butler has said she feels deeply indebted to Ronell's influence on her work and wrote in an edited collection \"Reading Ronell\": \"The different path that Ronell takes is precisely the path of difference: gay, difficult, affirmative, ironic.\" The collection’s editor Diane Davis highlighted the \"singular provocation of Ronell's 'remarkable critical oeuvre,'\" \"the devastating insights, the unprecedented writing style, the relentless destabilizations.\" In the sixth session of \"The Beast and the Sovereign\" on February 6 of 2002, Jacques Derrida devoted special attention to Ronell's \"Stupidity\" and commends the untranslatable complexity of her \"irony.\" \n\nBy contrast, in a 1990 review of \"The Telephone Book\" for the \"New York Times Book Review,\" novelist Robert Coover appreciated the \"visual pyrotechnics\" of the book's typography but found \"the argument… to be that of a fairly conventional academic paper, recognizably party-lined with fashionable Continental voices like Jacques Lacan, Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida,\" and found the connection that Ronell tried to establish between Heidegger, schizophrenia, and the telephone \"weak.\" In a 2002 review of \"Stupidity\" for the \"Times Literary Supplement,\" philosopher Jonathan Rée said Ronell's \"prose reads like a plodding translation of a French version of Heidegger, but there is hardly a sentence that does not try to stop the show to receive an ovation for its cleverness.\" Similarly, Bernd Hüppauf, former chair of the German department at NYU who hired Ronell but was later replaced by her, has described her work as \"translating incomprehensibility into pseudo-profundity.\"\n\nIn September 2017, a student, later identified as her male former graduate student Nimrod Reitman, filed a complaint in New York University’s Title IX office, accusing Ronell of sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and retaliation over the span of three years as her advisee. In May 2018, the university found Ronell responsible for sexual harassment and suspended her for the 2018–19 academic year. Ronell has not admitted any of the claims made in Reitman's complaint. On August 16, 2018, Reitman filed a lawsuit against Ronell and the university, alleging sexual harassment, sexual assault, and stalking.\n\nNYU is continuing to investigate an allegation of retaliation, following a letter to the university in defense of Ronell from major figures in the areas of feminism, philosophy, literature and history, including Judith Butler, Slavoj Žižek, Joan Scott and Jean-Luc Nancy, dated May 11, 2018. A leaked draft of the letter has been criticized for suggesting that Ronell should be excused on the basis of the significance of her academic contributions and for imputing a \"malicious intention\" to Reitman. Butler later regretted some wording of the letter.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies (CAJS or \"the Katz Center\") at the University of Pennsylvania is the world's first and only institution exclusively dedicated to post-doctoral research on Jewish Civilization. It is located at 420 Walnut Street between S. 4th and S. 5th Streets in the Old City, Philadelphia neighborhood of Philadelphia. The center is directed by Professor Steven Weitzman.\n\nThe institution now known as the Katz Center was founded in 1907 as the Dropsie College of Hebrew and Cognate Learning and finally as Dropsie University. It was named after its benefactor, Moses Aaron Dropsie (1821–1905), a wealthy man whose father was Jewish and mother was Christian but who self-identified as Jewish from the age of 14. Dropsie willed his entire fortune to \"the promotion of and instruction in the Hebrew and cognate languages and their respective literatures.\"\n\nDropsie granted more than 200 Ph.D.s between its inception and its closing as a degree-granting institution in 1986. Dropsie was also the publisher of the \"Jewish Quarterly Review\", which was at the time the most respected journal on the subject.\n\nThe faculty during the Dropsie era included scholars from outside the United States, including Benzion Netanyahu, who came from Jerusalem with his young sons, Yonatan (Yoni) and Benjamin (Bibi), who there had their first true exposures to American culture, which would become a touchstone for later interactions with the American public for Bibi.\n\nAlthough no longer a degree-granting college, it became the Annenberg Research Institute after its 1986 closing and turned into one of the country's most noted interdisciplinary post-doctoral fellowship programs. It merged with the University of Pennsylvania in 1993, after which the institution was renamed the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies. It continues to publish the \"Jewish Quarterly Review\", the oldest continuously published Judaic studies journal in English.\n\nToday, CAJS supports approximately 24 fellows each year who conduct their research at the University of Pennsylvania. Each fellow is given their own downtown Philadelphia office and meets with the others at weekly seminars. The papers they produce are published by the University of Pennsylvania Press at the conclusion of their term in the program.\n\nEach year has a specific theme; scholars apply if their current research fits the annual theme. For example, for the 2005-2006 academic year, the theme was \"The Jewish Book: Materials Texts and Comparative Contexts.\" For 2006-2007, fellows studied \"Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Life under Caliphs and Sultans.\"\n\nThe combination of the Dropsie/Annenberg library along with the University of Pennsylvania's resulted in a 350,000-volume collection on Judaica, including more than 8,000 rare books and an assortment of cuneiform tablets. Texts are available to scholars in Hebrew, English, German, Yiddish, Ladino, Arabic, and Latin.\n\nThere are also 451 codices in eleven alphabets and 24 languages and dialects. Some of the languages and dialects represented, in addition to those already listed, include Judeo-Arabic, Armenian, Telugu, and Syriac. Fragments from the Cairo Genizah and others written in Coptic and Demotic on papyrus round out the collection.\n\nThe library also holds the personal letters of more than 50 Jewish-American leaders from the 1800s and 1900s, including Isaac Leeser, Sabato Morais, & Abraham Neuman (three ministers of Congregation Mikveh Israel (Philadelphia)), Cyrus Adler (president: Dropsie College, Mikveh Israel, American Jewish Committee, Jewish Theological Seminary of America, librarian: Smithsonian Institution), Charles Cohen (president: Mikveh Israel, Fairmount Park Commission), his journalist sister Mary M.

{"id": "12474403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12474403", "title": "Climate change denial", "text": "Climate change denial\n\nClimate change denial, or global warming denial, is part of the global warming controversy. It involves denial, dismissal, or unwarranted doubt that contradicts the scientific opinion on climate change, including the extent to which it is caused by humans, its impacts on nature and human society, or the potential of adaptation to global warming by human actions. Some deniers endorse the term, while others prefer the term climate change skepticism. Several scientists have noted that \"skepticism\" is an inaccurate description for those who deny anthropogenic global warming. In effect, the two terms form a continuous, overlapping range of views, and generally have the same characteristics: both reject, to a greater or lesser extent, the scientific consensus on climate change. Climate change denial can also be implicit, when individuals or social groups accept the science but fail to come to terms with it or to translate their acceptance into action. Several social science studies have analyzed these positions as forms of denialism and pseudoscience.\n\nThe campaign to undermine public trust in climate science has been described as a \"denial machine\" organized by industrial, political and ideological interests, and supported by conservative media and skeptical bloggers to manufacture uncertainty about global warming. In the public debate, phrases such as \"climate skepticism\" have frequently been used with the same meaning as \"climate denialism\". The labels are contested: those actively challenging climate science commonly describe themselves as \"skeptics\", but many do not comply with common standards of scientific skepticism and, regardless of evidence, persistently deny the validity of human caused global warming.\n\nAlthough scientific opinion on climate change is that human activity is extremely likely to be the primary driver of climate change, the politics of global warming have been affected by climate change denial, hindering efforts to prevent climate change and adapt to the warming climate. Those promoting denial commonly use rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of a scientific controversy where there is none.\n\nOf the world's countries, the climate change denial industry is most powerful in the United States. From 2015 to 2017 (after having already served from 2003 to 2007), the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works was chaired by oil lobbyist and climate change denier Jim Inhofe, who had previously called climate change \"the greatest hoax ever perpetrated against the American people\" and claimed to have debunked the alleged hoax in February 2015 when he brought a snowball with him in the Senate chamber and tossed it across the floor. He was succeeded in 2017 by John Barrasso, who similarly said: \"The climate is constantly changing. The role human activity plays is not known.\" Organised campaigning to undermine public trust in climate science is associated with conservative economic policies and backed by industrial interests opposed to the regulation of emissions. Climate change denial has been associated with the fossil fuels lobby, the Koch brothers, industry advocates and conservative think tanks, often in the United States. More than 90% of papers sceptical on climate change originate from right-wing think tanks.\nThe total annual income of these climate change counter-movement-organizations is roughly $900 million. Between 2002 and 2010, nearly $120 million (£77 million) was anonymously donated via the Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund to more than 100 organisations seeking to undermine the public perception of the science on climate change. In 2013 the Center for Media and Democracy reported that the State Policy Network (SPN), an umbrella group of 64 U.S. think tanks, had been lobbying on behalf of major corporations and conservative donors to oppose climate change regulation.\n\nSince the late 1970s, oil companies have published research broadly in line with the standard views on global warming. Despite this, oil companies organized a climate change denial campaign to disseminate public disinformation for several decades, a strategy that has been compared to the organized denial of the hazards of tobacco smoking by the tobacco industry.\n\n\"Climate change skepticism\" and \"climate change denial\" refer to denial, dismissal or unwarranted doubt of the scientific consensus on the rate and extent of global warming, its significance, or its connection to human behavior, in whole or in part. Though there is a distinction between skepticism which indicates doubting the truth of an assertion and outright denial of the truth of an assertion, in the public debate phrases such as \"climate scepticism\" have frequently been used with the same meaning as climate denialism or contrarianism.\n\nThe terminology emerged in the 1990s. Even though all scientists adhere to scientific skepticism as an inherent part of the process, by mid November 1995 the word \"skeptic\" was being used specifically for the minority who publicised views contrary to the scientific consensus. This small group of scientists presented their views in public statements and the media, rather than to the scientific community. This usage continued. In his December 1995 article \"The Heat is On: The warming of the world's climate sparks a blaze of denial \", Ross Gelbspan said industry had engaged \"a small band of skeptics\" to confuse public opinion in a \"persistent and well-funded campaign of denial\". His 1997 book \"The Heat is On\" may have been the first to concentrate specifically on the topic. In it, Gelbspan discussed a \"pervasive denial of global warming\" in a \"persistent campaign of denial and suppression\" involving \"undisclosed funding of these 'greenhouse skeptics' \" with \"the climate skeptics\" confusing the public and influencing decision makers.\n\nA November 2006 CBC Television documentary on the campaign was titled \"The Denial Machine\". In 2007 journalist Sharon Begley reported on the \"denial machine\", a phrase subsequently used by academics.\n\nIn addition to \"explicit denial\", social groups have shown \"implicit denial\" by accepting the scientific consensus, but failing to come to terms with its implications or take action to reduce the problem. This was exemplified in Kari Norgaard's study of a village in Norway affected by climate change, where residents diverted their attention to other issues.\n\nThe terminology is debated: most of those actively rejecting the scientific consensus use the terms \"skeptic\" and \"climate change skepticism\", and only a few have expressed preference for being described as deniers, but the word \"skepticism\" is incorrectly used, as scientific skepticism is an intrinsic part of scientific methodology. The term \"contrarian\" is more specific, but used less frequently. In academic literature and journalism, the terms \"climate change denial\" and \"climate change deniers\" have well established usage as descriptive terms without any pejorative intent. Both the National Center for Science Education and historian Spencer R. Weart recognise that either option is problematic, but have decided to use \"climate change denial\" rather than \"skepticism\".\n\nTerms related to \"denialism\" have been criticised for introducing a moralistic tone, and potentially implying a link with Holocaust denial. There have been claims that this link is intentional, which academics have strongly disputed. The usage of \"denial\" long predates the Holocaust, and is commonly applied in other areas such as HIV/AIDS denialism: the claim is described by John Timmer of \"Ars Technica\" as itself being a form of denial.\n\nIn December 2014, an open letter from the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry called on the media to stop using the term \"skepticism\" when referring to climate change denial. They contrasted scientific skepticism—which is \"foundational to the scientific method\"—with denial—\"the a priori rejection of ideas without objective consideration\"—and the behavior of those involved in political attempts to undermine climate science. They said \"Not all individuals who call themselves climate change skeptics are deniers. But virtually all deniers have falsely branded themselves as skeptics. By perpetrating this misnomer, journalists have granted undeserved credibility to those who reject science and scientific inquiry.\" In June 2015 Media Matters for America were told by \"The New York Times\" Public Editor that the newspaper was increasingly tending to use \"denier\" when \"someone is challenging established science\", but assessing this on an individual basis with no fixed policy, and would not use the term when someone was \"kind of wishy-washy on the subject or in the middle.\" The executive director of the Society of Environmental Journalists said that while there was reasonable skepticism about specific issues, she felt that denier was \"the most accurate term when someone claims there is no such thing as global warming, or agrees that it exists but denies that it has any cause we could understand or any impact that could be measured.\"\n\nResearch on the effect of on the climate began in 1824, when Joseph Fourier inferred the existence the atmospheric \"greenhouse effect\". In 1860, John Tyndall quantified the effects of greenhouse gases on absorption of infrared radiation. Svante Arrhenius in 1896 showed that coal burning could cause global warming, and in 1938 Guy Stewart Callendar found it already happening to some extent. Research advanced rapidly after 1940; from 1957, Roger Revelle alerted the public to risks that fossil fuel burning was \"a grandiose scientific experiment\" on climate. NASA and NOAA took on research, the 1979 Charney Report concluded that substantial warming was already on the way, and \"A wait-and-see policy may mean waiting until it is too late.\" \n\nIn 1959 a scientist working for Shell suggested in a New Scientist article, that carbon cycles are too vast to upset Nature's balance.\n\nIn response to increasing public awareness of the greenhouse effect in the 1970s, conservative reaction built up, denying environmental concerns which could lead to government regulation. With the 1981 Presidency of Ronald Reagan, global warming became a political issue, with immediate plans to cut spending on environmental research, particularly climate related, and stop funding for monitoring. Reagan appointed as Secretary of Energy James B. Edwards, who said that there was no real global warming problem. Congressman Al Gore had studied under Revelle and was aware of the developing science: he joined others in arranging congressional hearings from 1981 onwards, with testimony by scientists including Revelle, Stephen Schneider and Wallace Smith Broecker. The hearings gained enough public attention to reduce the cuts in atmospheric research. A polarized party-political debate developed. In 1982 Sherwood B. Idso published his book \"Carbon Dioxide: Friend or Foe?\" which said increases in would not warm the planet, but would fertilize crops and were \"something to be encouraged and not suppressed\", while complaining that his theories had been rejected by the \"scientific establishment\". An Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report in 1983 said global warming was \"not a theoretical problem but a threat whose effects will be felt within a few years\", with potentially \"catastrophic\" consequences. The Reagan administration reacted by calling the report \"alarmist\", and the dispute got wide news coverage. Public attention turned to other issues, then the 1985 finding of a polar ozone hole brought a swift international response. To the public, this was related to climate change and the possibility of effective action, but news interest faded.\n\nPublic attention was renewed amidst summer droughts and heat waves when James Hansen testified to a Congressional hearing on 23 June 1988, stating with high confidence that long term warming was under way with severe warming likely within the next 50 years, and warning of likely storms and floods. There was increasing media attention: the scientific community had reached a broad consensus that the climate was warming, human activity was very likely the primary cause, and there would be significant consequences if the warming trend was not curbed. These facts encouraged discussion about new laws concerning environmental regulation, which was opposed by the fossil fuel industry.\n\nFrom 1989 onwards industry funded organisations including the Global Climate Coalition and the George C. Marshall Institute sought to spread doubt among the public, in a strategy already developed by the tobacco industry. A small group of scientists opposed to the consensus on global warming became politically involved, and with support from conservative political interests, began publishing in books and the press rather than in scientific journals. This small group of scientists included some of the same people that were part of the strategy already tried by the tobacco industry. Spencer Weart identifies this period as the point where legitimate skepticism about basic aspects of climate science was no longer justified, and those spreading mistrust about these issues became deniers. As their arguments were increasingly refuted by the scientific community and new data, deniers turned to political arguments, making personal attacks on the reputation of scientists, and promoting ideas of a global warming conspiracy.\n\nWith the 1989 fall of communism and the environmental movement's international reach at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the attention of U.S. conservative think tanks, which had been organised in the 1970s as an intellectual counter-movement to socialism, turned from the \"red scare\" to the \"green scare\" which they saw as a threat to their aims of private property, free trade market economies and global capitalism. As a counter-movement, they used environmental skepticism to promote denial of the reality of problems such as loss of biodiversity and climate change.\n\nIn 1992, an EPA report linked second-hand smoke with lung cancer. The tobacco industry engaged the APCO Worldwide public relations company, which set out a strategy of astroturfing campaigns to cast doubt on the science by linking smoking anxieties with other issues, including global warming, in order to turn public opinion against calls for government intervention. The campaign depicted public concerns as \"unfounded fears\" supposedly based only on \"junk science\" in contrast to their \"sound science\", and operated through front groups, primarily the Advancement of Sound Science Center (TASSC) and its Junk Science website, run by Steven Milloy. A tobacco company memo commented \"Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy.\" During the 1990s, the tobacco campaign died away, and TASSC began taking funding from oil companies including Exxon. Its website became central in distributing \"almost every kind of climate-change denial that has found its way into the popular press.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, the Marshall Institute began campaigning against increased regulations on environmental issues such as acid rain, ozone depletion, second-hand smoke, and the dangers of DDT. In each case their argument was that the science was too uncertain to justify any government intervention, a strategy it borrowed from earlier efforts to downplay the health effects of tobacco in the 1980s. This campaign would continue for the next two decades.\n\nThese efforts succeeded in influencing public perception of climate science. Between 1988 and the 1990s, public discourse shifted from the science and data of climate change to discussion of politics and surrounding controversy.\n\nThe campaign to spread doubt continued into the 1990s, including an advertising campaign funded by coal industry advocates intended to \"reposition global warming as theory rather than fact,\" and a 1998 proposal written by the American Petroleum Institute intending to recruit scientists to convince politicians, the media and the public that climate science was too uncertain to warrant environmental regulation. The proposal included a US$ 5,000,000 multi-point strategy to \"maximize the impact of scientific views consistent with ours on Congress, the media and other key audiences\", with a goal of \"raising questions about and undercutting the 'prevailing scientific wisdom'\".\n\nIn 1998, Gelbspan noted that his fellow journalists accepted that global warming was occurring, but said they were in \"'stage-two' denial of the climate crisis\", unable to accept the feasibility of answers to the problem. A subsequent book by Milburn and Conrad on \"The Politics of Denial\" described \"economic and psychological forces\" producing denial of the consensus on global warming issues.\n\nThese efforts by climate change denial groups were recognized as an organized campaign beginning in the 2000s. The sociologists Riley Dunlap and Aaron McCright played a significant role in this shift when they published an article in 2000 exploring the connection between conservative think tanks and climate change denial. Later work would continue the argument specific groups were marshalling skepticism against climate change - A study in 2008 from the University of Central Florida analyzed the sources of \"environmentally skeptical\" literature published in the United States. The analysis demonstrated that 92% of the literature was partly or wholly affiliated with a self-proclaimed conservative think tanks. A later piece of research from 2015 identified 4,556 individuals with overlapping network ties to 164 organizations which are responsible for the most efforts to downplay the threat of climate change in the U.S.\n\nGelbspan's \"Boiling Point\", published in 2004, detailed the fossil-fuel industry's campaign to deny climate change and undermine public confidence in climate science. In \"Newsweek\"'s August 2007 cover story \"The Truth About Denial\", Sharon Begley reported that \"the denial machine is running at full throttle\", and said that this \"well-coordinated, well-funded campaign\" by contrarian scientists, free-market think tanks, and industry had \"created a paralyzing fog of doubt around climate change.\"\n\nReferencing work of sociologists Robert Antonio and Robert Brulle, Wayne A. White has written that climate change denial has become the top priority in a broader agenda against environmental regulation being pursued by neoliberals. Today, climate change skepticism is most prominently seen in the United States, where the media disproportionately features views of the climate change denial community. In addition to the media, the contrarian movement has also been sustained by the growth of the internet, having gained some of its support from internet bloggers, talk radio hosts and newspaper columnists.\n\n\"The New York Times\" and others reported in 2015 that oil companies knew that burning oil and gas could cause climate change and global warming since the 1970s but nonetheless funded deniers for years. Dana Nuccitelli wrote in \"The Guardian\" that a small fringe group of climate deniers were no longer taken seriously at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, in an agreement that \"we need to stop delaying and start getting serious about preventing a climate crisis.\" However, \"The New York Times\" says any implementation is voluntary and will depend on any future world leaders—and every Republican candidate in 2016 has questioned or denied the science of climate change.\n\nA poll conducted by the New York Times Magazine in 2006 found that only 56% of Americans believe that average global temperatures have risen even though scientists think that they have. A majority of Americans also believe that scientists are still divided on the issue.\n\nA study was conducted to determine whether or not conservative white Americans were more likely to deny climate change. Researchers from Lyman Briggs College took samples of conservative white males of different understandings of global warming and categorized them separately. Categorized into three groups: conservative white males who claim to understand global warming, conservative white males who claim not to understand global warming, and other individuals. It was concluded that many of these conservative white males who self-report understanding global warming believe that the mass media has over exaggerated the effects of global warming and climate change and that the effects of it have never happened. 48.4% of conservative white males who report understanding global warming very well in the study said that the effects of global warming will never happen compared to 19% who do not understand it very well and 7.4% of all other adults. Many people appear to be confused by climate science however, the study showed that the people who self reported understanding global warming were most prone to denying.\n\nAnother study by Utah State University discusses geographic variation on climate change opinions at state and local scales in the United States. It was noted that prior research was found that public climate change policy support and behavior are significantly influenced by public beliefs, attitudes and risk perceptions. In addition, to complement previous stated factors, they're also influenced by knowledge, emotion, ideology, demographics, and personal experience. Where people live can account for some significance, since some people live in weather extreme areas, they could be desensitized to the overall change in climates as well. Surveys were conducted and showed that 63% of Americans believe that global warming is happening, 47% believe that it is human caused and 42% believe that most scientists think it is happening. In the study, a model was constructed to determine the public opinion of climate change across the nation. Representative telephone based surveys were used to investigate opinions in four states: California, Texas, Ohio and Colorado in addition to the Columbus and San Francisco metropolitan areas.\n\nWhile it had been the case as of 2010 that more than two-thirds of television weathercasters had denied that warming was real and largely caused by human activity, as of March 2018 the rate of acceptance among TV forecasters that the climate is changing has increased to ninety-five percent. The number of local television stories about global warming has also increased, by fifteen-fold. Climate Central has received some of the credit for this because they provide classes for meteorologists and graphics for television stations.\n\nThe Clexit Coalition claims to be: \"A new international organisation (which) aims to prevent ratification of the costly and dangerous Paris global warming treaty\". It has members in 26 countries. According to The Guardian newspaper: \"Clexit leaders are heavily involved in tobacco and fossil fuel-funded organizations\".\n\nSome climate change denial groups say that because is only a trace gas in the atmosphere (roughly 400ppm, or 0.04%) it can only have a minor effect on the climate. Scientists have known for over a century that even this small proportion has a significant warming effect, and doubling the proportion leads to a large temperature increase. The scientific consensus, as summarized by the IPCC's fourth assessment report, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other reports, is that human activity is the leading cause of climate change. The burning of fossil fuels accounts for around 30 billion tons of each year, which is 130 times the amount produced by volcanoes. Some groups allege that water vapor is a more significant greenhouse gas, and is left out of many climate models. While water vapor is a greenhouse gas, the very short atmospheric lifetime of water vapor (about 10 days) compared that of (hundreds of years) means that is the primary driver of increasing temperatures; water vapour acts as a feedback, not a forcing. Water vapor has been incorporated into climate models since their inception in the late 1800s. \n\nClimate denial groups may also argue that global warming stopped recently, a global warming hiatus, or that global temperatures are actually decreasing, leading to global cooling. These arguments are based on short term fluctuations, and ignore the long term pattern of warming.\n\nThese groups often point to natural variability, such as sunspots and cosmic rays, to explain the warming trend. According to these groups, there is natural variability that will abate over time, and human influences have little to do with it. These factors are already taken into account when developing climate models, and the scientific consensus is that they cannot explain the observed warming trend.\n\nAt a May 2018 meeting of the United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Alabama's Representative Mo Brooks claimed that sea level rise is caused not by melting glaciers but rather by coastal erosion and silt that flows from rivers into the ocean.\n\nClimate change denial literature often features the suggestion that we should wait for better technologies before addressing climate change, when they will be more affordable and effective.\n\nGlobal warming conspiracy theories have been posited which allege that the scientific consensus is illusory, or that climatologists are acting on their own financial interests by causing undue alarm about a changing climate. Despite leaked emails during the Climatic Research Unit email controversy, as well as multinational, independent research on the topic, no evidence of such a conspiracy has been presented, and strong consensus exists among scientists from a multitude of political, social, organizational and national backgrounds about the extent and cause of climate change. Several researchers have concluded that around 97% of climate scientists agree with this consensus. As well, much of the data used in climate science is publicly available to be viewed and interpreted by competing researchers as well as the public.\n\nIn 2012, research by Stephan Lewandowsky (then of the University of Western Australia) concluded that belief in other conspiracy theories, such as that the FBI was responsible for the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., was associated with being more likely to endorse climate change denial.\n\nIn 2004 Stefan Rahmstorf described how the media give the misleading impression that climate change was still disputed within the scientific community, attributing this impression to PR efforts of climate change skeptics. He identified different positions argued by climate skeptics, which he used as a taxonomy of climate change skepticism: Later the model was also applied on denial.\nThis taxonomy has been used in social science for analysis of publications, and to categorize climate change skepticism and climate change denial. Sometimes, a fourth category called \"consensus denial\" is added, which describes people who question the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming.\n\nThe National Center for Science Education describes climate change denial as disputing differing points in the scientific consensus, a sequential range of arguments from denying the occurrence of climate change, accepting that but denying any significant human contribution, accepting these but denying scientific findings on how this would affect nature and human society, to accepting all these but denying that humans can mitigate or reduce the problems. James L. Powell provides a more extended list, as does climatologist Michael E. Mann in \"six stages of denial\", a ladder in which deniers have over time conceded acceptance of points, while retreating to a position which still rejects the mainstream consensus:\n\nJournalists and newspaper columnists including George Monbiot and Ellen Goodman, among others, have described climate change denial as a form of denialism.\n\nDenialism in this context has been defined by Chris and Mark Hoofnagle as the use of rhetorical devices \"to give the appearance of legitimate debate where there is none, an approach that has the ultimate goal of rejecting a proposition on which a scientific consensus exists.\" This process characteristically uses one or more of the following tactics:\n\nIn 2015, environmentalist Bill McKibben accused President Obama (widely regarded as strongly in favour of action on climate change) of \"Catastrophic Climate-Change Denial\", for his approval of oil-drilling permits in offshore Alaska. According to McKibben, the President has also \"opened huge swaths of the Powder River basin to new coal mining.\" McKibben calls this \"climate denial of the status quo sort\", where the President denies \"the meaning of the science, which is that we must keep carbon in the ground.\" \n\nVarious groups, including the National Center for Science Education, have described climate change denial as a form of pseudoscience. Climate change skepticism, while in some cases professing to do research on climate change, has focused instead on influencing the opinion of the public, legislators and the media, in contrast to legitimate science.\n\nIn a review of the book \"The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe\" by Michael D. Gordin, David Morrison wrote:\n\nPublic opinion on climate change is significantly impacted by media coverage of climate change, and the effects of climate change denial campaigns. Campaigns to undermine public confidence in climate science have decreased public belief in climate change, which in turn have impacted legislative efforts to curb emissions.\n\nThe popular media in the U.S. gives greater attention to climate change skeptics than the scientific community as a whole, and the level of agreement within the scientific community has not been accurately communicated. In some cases, news outlets have allowed climate change skeptics to explain the science of climate change instead of experts in climatology. US and UK media coverage differ from that presented in other countries, where reporting is more consistent with the scientific literature. Some journalists attribute the difference to climate change denial being propagated, mainly in the US, by business-centered organizations employing tactics worked out previously by the US tobacco lobby. In France, the US and the UK, the opinions of climate change skeptics appear much more frequently in conservative news outlets than other news, and in many cases those opinions are left uncontested.\n\nThe efforts of Al Gore and other environmental campaigns have focused on the effects of global warming and have managed to increase awareness and concern, but despite these efforts, the number of Americans believing humans are the cause of global warming was holding steady at 61% in 2007, and those believing the popular media was understating the issue remained about 35%. A recent poll from 2015 suggests that while Americans are growing more aware of the dangers and implications of climate change for future generations, the majority are not worried about it. From a survey conducted in 2004, it was found that more than 30% of news presented in the previous decade showed equal attention to both human and non human contributions to global warming. \n\nA study assessed the public perception and actions to climate change, on grounds of belief systems, and identified seven psychological barriers affecting the behavior that otherwise would facilitate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental stewardship. The author found the following barriers: cognition, ideological world views, comparisons to key people, costs and momentum, discredence toward experts and authorities, perceived risks of change, and inadequate behavioral changes.\n\nIt has been suggested that climate change can conflict with a nationalistic view because it is \"unsolvable\" at the national level and requires collective action between nations or between local communities, and that therefore populist nationalism tends to reject the science of climate change.\n\nIn a TED talk Yuval Noah Harari notes: \n\nOn the other hand, it has been argued that effective climate action is polycentric rather than international, and national interest in multilateral groups can be furthered by overcoming climate change denial. Climate change contrarians may believe in a \"caricature\" of internationalist state intervention that is perceived as threatening national sovereignty, and may re-attribute risks such as flooding to international institutions. UK Independence Party policy on climate change has been influenced by noted contrarian Christopher Monckton and then by its energy spokesman Roger Helmer MEP who stated in a speech \"It is not clear that the rise in atmospheric CO is anthropogenic\".\n\nEfforts to lobby against environmental regulation have included campaigns to manufacture doubt about the science behind climate change, and to obscure the scientific consensus and data. These efforts have undermined public confidence in climate science, and impacted climate change lobbying.\n\nThe political advocacy organizations FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity, funded by brothers David and Charles Koch of Koch Industries, were important in supporting the Tea Party movement and in encouraging the movement to focus on climate change. Other conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation, Marshall Institute, Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute were significant participants in these lobbying attempts, seeking to halt or eliminate environmental regulations.\n\nThis approach to downplay the significance of climate change was copied from tobacco lobbyists; in the face of scientific evidence linking tobacco to lung cancer, to prevent or delay the introduction of regulation. Lobbyists attempted to discredit the scientific research by creating doubt and manipulating debate. They worked to discredit the scientists involved, to dispute their findings, and to create and maintain an apparent controversy by promoting claims that contradicted scientific research. \"\"Doubt is our product,\" boasted a now infamous 1969 industry memo. Doubt would shield the tobacco industry from litigation and regulation for decades to come.\" In 2006, George Monbiot wrote in \"The Guardian\" about similarities between the methods of groups funded by Exxon, and those of the tobacco giant Philip Morris, including direct attacks on peer-reviewed science, and attempts to create public controversy and doubt.\n\nFormer National Academy of Sciences president Frederick Seitz, who, according to an article by Mark Hertsgaard in \"Vanity Fair\", earned about US$585,000 in the 1970s and 1980s as a consultant to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, went on to chair groups such as the Science and Environmental Policy Project and the George C. Marshall Institute alleged to have made efforts to \"downplay\" global warming. Seitz stated in the 1980s that \"Global warming is far more a matter of politics than of climate.\" Seitz authored the Oregon Petition, a document published jointly by the Marshall Institute and Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine in opposition to the Kyoto protocol. The petition and accompanying \"Research Review of Global Warming Evidence\" claimed:\nThe proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind. There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. … We are living in an increasingly lush environment of plants and animals as a result of the carbon dioxide increase. Our children will enjoy an Earth with far more plant and animal life than that with which we now are blessed. This is a wonderful and unexpected gift from the Industrial Revolution.\nGeorge Monbiot wrote in \"The Guardian\" that this petition, which he criticizes as misleading and tied to industry funding, \"has been cited by almost every journalist who claims that climate change is a myth.\" Efforts by climate change denial groups played a significant role in the eventual rejection of the Kyoto protocol in the US.\n\nMonbiot has written about another group founded by the tobacco lobby, The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (TASSC), that now campaigns against measures to combat global warming. In again trying to manufacture the appearance of a grass-roots movement against \"unfounded fear\" and \"over-regulation,\" Monbiot states that TASSC \"has done more damage to the campaign to halt [climate change] than any other body.\"\n\nDrexel University environmental sociologist Robert Brulle analysed the funding of 91 organizations opposed to restrictions on carbon emissions, which he termed the \"climate change counter-movement.\" Between 2003 and 2013, the donor-advised funds Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund, combined, were the largest funders, accounting for about one quarter of the total funds, and the American Enterprise Institute was the largest recipient, 16% of the total funds. The study also found that the amount of money donated to these organizations by means of foundations whose funding sources cannot be traced had risen.\n\nSeveral large corporations within the fossil fuel industry provide significant funding for attempts to mislead the public about the trustworthiness of climate science. ExxonMobil and the Koch family foundations have been identified as especially influential funders of climate change contrarianism.\n\nAfter the IPCC released its February 2007 report, the American Enterprise Institute offered British, American and other scientists $10,000 plus travel expenses to publish articles critical of the assessment. The institute had received more than US$1.6 million from Exxon, and its vice-chairman of trustees was former head of Exxon Lee Raymond. Raymond sent letters that alleged the IPCC report was not \"supported by the analytical work.\" More than 20 AEI employees worked as consultants to the George W. Bush administration. Despite her initial conviction that climate change denial would abate with time, Senator Barbara Boxer said that when she learned of the AEI's offer, she \"realized there was a movement behind this that just wasn't giving up.\"\n\nThe Royal Society conducted a survey that found ExxonMobil had given US$2.9 million to American groups that \"misinformed the public about climate change,\" 39 of which \"misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence\". In 2006, the Royal Society issued a demand that ExxonMobil withdraw funding for climate change denial. The letter drew criticism, notably from Timothy Ball who argued the society attempted to \"politicize the private funding of science and to censor scientific debate.\"\n\nExxonMobil denied that it has been trying to mislead the public about global warming. A spokesman, Gantt Walton, said that ExxonMobil's funding of research does not mean that it acts to influence the research, and that ExxonMobil supports taking action to curb the output of greenhouse gasses. Research conducted at an Exxon archival collection at the University of Texas and interviews with former employees by journalists indicate the scientific opinion within the company and their public posture towards climate change was contradictory.\n\nBetween 1989 and 2002 the Global Climate Coalition, a group of mainly United States businesses, used aggressive lobbying and public relations tactics to oppose action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight the Kyoto Protocol. The coalition was financed by large corporations and trade groups from the oil, coal and auto industries. \"The New York Times\" reported that \"even as the coalition worked to sway opinion [towards skepticism], its own scientific and technical experts were advising that the science backing the role of greenhouse gases in global warming could not be refuted.\" In 2000, Ford Motor Company was the first company to leave the coalition as a result of pressure from environmentalists, followed by Daimler-Chrysler, Texaco, the Southern Company and General Motors subsequently left to GCC. The organization closed in 2002.\n\nFrom January 2009 through June 2010, the oil, coal and utility industries spent $500 million in lobby expenditures in opposition to legislation to address climate change.\n\nIn early 2015, several media reports emerged saying that Willie Soon, a popular scientist among climate change deniers, had failed to disclose conflicts of interest in at least 11 scientific papers published since 2008. They reported that he received a total of $1.25m from ExxonMobil, Southern Company, the American Petroleum Institute and a foundation run by the Koch brothers. Charles R. Alcock, director of the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, where Soon was based, said that allowing funders of Soon's work to prohibit disclosure of funding sources was a mistake, which will not be permitted in future grant agreements.\n\nThe Republican Party in the United States is unique in denying anthropogenic climate change among conservative political parties across the Western world. In 1994, according to a leaked memo, the Republican strategist Frank Luntz advised members of the Republican Party, with regard to climate change, that \"you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue\" and \"challenge the science\" by \"recruiting experts who are sympathetic to your view.\" (In 2006, Luntz said he still believes \"back [in] '97, '98, the science was uncertain\", but he now agrees with the scientific consensus.) From 2008 to 2017, the Republican Party went from \"debating how to combat human-caused climate change to arguing that it does not exist,\" according to \"The New York Times\". In 2011 \"more than half of the Republicans in the House and three-quarters of Republican senators\" said \"that the threat of global warming, as a man-made and highly threatening phenomenon, is at best an exaggeration and at worst an utter \"hoax\"\" according to Judith Warner writing in \"The New York Times Magazine\".\nIn 2014, more than 55% of congressional Republicans were climate change deniers, according to NBC News.\nAccording to PolitiFact in May 2014, Jerry Brown's statement that 'virtually no Republican' in Washington accepts climate change science, was \"mostly true\"; PolitiFact counted \"eight out of 278, or about 3 percent\" of Republican members of Congress who \"accept the prevailing scientific conclusion that global warming is both real and man-made.\"\n\nIn 2005, \"The New York Times\" reported that Philip Cooney, former fossil fuel lobbyist and \"climate team leader\" at the American Petroleum Institute and President George W. Bush's chief of staff of the Council on Environmental Quality, had \"repeatedly edited government climate reports in ways that play down links between such emissions and global warming, according to internal documents.\" Sharon Begley reported in \"Newsweek\" that Cooney \"edited a 2002 report on climate science by sprinkling it with phrases such as 'lack of understanding' and 'considerable uncertainty.'\" Cooney reportedly removed an entire section on climate in one report, whereupon another lobbyist sent him a fax saying \"You are doing a great job.\" Cooney announced his resignation two days after the story of his tampering with scientific reports broke, but a few days later it was announced that Cooney would take up a position with ExxonMobil.\n\nUnited States Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, in a 19 June 2017 interview with CNBC, acknowledged the existence of climate change and impact from humans, but said that he did not agree with the idea that carbon dioxide was the primary driver of global warming pointing instead to \"the ocean waters and this environment that we live in\". The American Meteorological Society responded in a letter to Perry saying that it is \"critically important that you understand that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are the primary cause\", pointing to conclusions of scientists worldwide.\n\nRepublican Jim Bridenstine, the first elected politician to serve as NASA administrator, had previously stated that global temperatures were not rising. A month after the Senate confirmed his NASA position in April 2018, he acknowledged that human emissions of greenhouse gases are raising global temperatures.\n\nAccording to documents leaked in February 2012, The Heartland Institute is developing a curriculum for use in schools which frames climate change as a scientific controversy. In 2017, Glenn Branch, Deputy Director of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), wrote that \"the Heartland Institute is continuing to inflict its climate change denial literature on science teachers across the country\". He also described how some science teachers were reacting to Heartland's mailings: \"Fortunately, the Heartland mailing continues to be greeted with skepticism and dismissed with scorn.\"<ref name=\"NCSE_Branch_6/5/2017\"></ref> The NCSE has prepared Classroom Resources in response to Heartland and other anti-science threats.\n\nBranch also referred to an article by ClimateFeedback.org which reviewed an unsolicited Heartland booklet, entitled \"Why Scientists Disagree about Global Warming\", which was sent to science teachers in the United States. Their intention was to send it to \"more than 200,000 K-12 teachers\". Each significant claim was rated for accuracy by scientists who were experts on that topic. Overall, they scored the accuracy of the booklet with an \"F\": \"it could hardly score lower\", and \"the \"Key Findings\" section are incorrect, misleading, based on flawed logic, or simply factually inaccurate.\"\n\nManufactured uncertainty over climate change, the fundamental strategy of climate change denial, has been very effective, particularly in the US. It has contributed to low levels of public concern and to government inaction worldwide. An Angus Reid poll released in 2010 indicates that global warming skepticism in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom has been rising. There may be multiple causes of this trend, including a focus on economic rather than environmental issues, and a negative perception of the United Nations and its role in discussing climate change.\n\nAnother cause may be weariness from overexposure to the topic: secondary polls suggest that the public may have been discouraged by extremism when discussing the topic, while other polls show 54% of U.S. voters believe that \"the news media make global warming appear worse than it really is.\" A poll in 2009 regarding the issue of whether \"some scientists have falsified research data to support their own theories and beliefs about global warming\" showed that 59% of Americans believed it \"at least somewhat likely\", with 35% believing it was \"very likely\".\n\nAccording to Tim Wirth, \"They patterned what they did after the tobacco industry. […] Both figured, sow enough doubt, call the science uncertain and in dispute. That's had a huge impact on both the public and Congress.\" This approach has been propagated by the US media, presenting a false balance between climate science and climate skeptics. \"Newsweek\" reports that the majority of Europe and Japan accept the consensus on scientific climate change, but only one third of Americans considered human activity to play a major role in climate change in 2006; 64% believed that scientists disagreed about it \"a lot.\" A 2007 \"Newsweek\" poll found these numbers were declining, although majorities of Americans still believed that scientists were uncertain about climate change and its causes. Rush Holt wrote a piece for \"Science\", which appeared in \"Newsweek\":\n\nDeliberate attempts by the Western Fuels Association \"to confuse the public\" have succeeded in their objectives. This has been \"exacerbated by media treatment of the climate issue\". According to a Pew poll in 2012, 57% of the US public are unaware of, or outright reject, the scientific consensus on climate change. Some organizations promoting climate change denial have asserted that scientists are increasingly rejecting climate change, but this notion is contradicted by research showing that 97% of published papers endorse the scientific consensus, and that percentage is increasing with time.\n\nSocial psychologist Craig Foster compares climate change denialists to flat-earth believers and the reaction to the latter by the scientific community. Foster states, \"the potential and kinetic energy devoted to counter the flat-earth movement is wasteful and misguided... I don't understand why anybody would worry about the flat-earth gnat while facing the climate change mammoth... Climate change denial does not require belief. It only requires neglect.\"\n\nIn 2016, Aaron McCright argued that anti-environmentalism—and climate change denial specifically—has expanded to a point in the US where it has now become \"a central tenet of the current conservative and Republican identity.\"\n\nOn the other hand, global oil companies have begun to acknowledge the existence of climate change and its risks.\n\nManufactured climate change denial is also influencing how scientific knowledge is communicated to the public. According to climate scientist Michael E. Mann, \"...universities and scientific societies and organizations, publishers, etc.—are too often risk averse when it comes to defending and communicating science that is perceived as threatening by powerful interests...\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8228639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8228639", "title": "Dalpat Vilas", "text": "Dalpat Vilas\n\nThe Dalpat Vilas is the surviving fragment of a historical manuscript. Written in the Rajasthani language, it is the earliest known Rajput source of Mughal-Rajput relations. The initial portion of the manuscript covers the genealogy of the Rathores (of Marwar) and the Sur dynasty. The bulk of the manuscript chronicles events in Marwar and adjoining areas during the reign of Akbar.\n\nThe author of the \"Dalpat Vilas\" remains unknown. It can be inferred that he was probably a Vaishnav Brahman as in the manuscript Keshvaraya (Vishnu) is said to have protected princes Dalpat and Bhopat.\n\nThe eponymous Prince Dalpat was a Rajput of the Rathore clan and a scion of Bika (the founder of Bikaner). In the manuscript, Bika is referred to as \"Vikramaditya\". Dalpat's father was Maharaja Rai Singh of Bikaner. Rai Singh was in turn, the grandson of Jaitsingh (a grandson of Bika).\n\nThe \"Dalpat Vilas\" was probably written during Maharaja Rai Singh's rule in the period 1579–1612 C.E.\n\nJaitsingh was killed in a battle with Maldev of Jodhpur. Jaitsingh's son, Kalyanmal was in the wilderness until he received the assistance of Sher Shah Suri. Jaitsi's father, Rav Lunkaran had previously given shelter to Sher Shah. Sher Shah gave Bayana, Hissar, Rewari and Mewat to Kalyanmal and later defeated Maldev. Kalyanmal was thus finally able to rule from Bikaner.\n\nWriting of the Sur dynasty, the manuscript states that Sher Shah died of injuries suffered during the siege of Kalinjar. Sher Shah's son, Salem (Islam) Khan was succeeded by Firoz Shah. The young boy was killed by Sher Shah's nephew Mamrez (Mubariz) Khan. Mamrez Khan reportedly went insane after the crime and his \"vakil\" (minister) Hemu seized power.\n\nThe death of Humayun, Akbar's coronation at Kalanaur, Hemu's capture of Delhi and Hemu's defeat at Panipat are briefly mentioned. Hemu (also called Vasant Raya) is said to have been killed, not by Akbar but by his nobles Bairam Khan and Bali Beg. Kalyanmal of Bikaner is said to have agreed to receive Bairam Khan (after he rebelled against Akbar) while Rana Udaysimha (of Mewar) and Maldev of Jodhpur refused to do so.\n\nThe next event mentioned is the marriage of Prince Rai Singh to Jaswant-de, the daughter of Rana Udaysimha. Prince Bhopat and Prince Dalpat were the two sons from this marriage.\n\nDescribed next is a ceremony at Nagaur in 1570 C.E., where Akbar married two princesses from Bikaner, Bhanumati (daughter of Bhimraj) and Raj Kanwari (daughter of Kanhaji). Kalyanmal was sent for by Akbar, and left his son, Rai Singh with the emperor. Akbar also received Maldev's son Chandrasen. Rawal Hariraj of Jaisalmer is said to have sent his daughter (with Bhagwant Das Kachhwaha) to Akbar. Udaya Singh, ruler of Sirohi, came to promote his claim (as older brother of Chandrasen) to be ruler of Marwar. Udaya Singh's visit is not mentioned by the Dalpat Vilas. Kalyanmal later received Jodhpur as a \"jagir\" from Akbar, he entrusted the fort to Rai Singh. In the interim, Udaya Singh had died and the new ruler, Rav Man had killed Udaya Singh's wife Pushpavati ( the sister of Rai Singh). In 1572, Rai Singh retaliated by attacking and sacking Sirohi.\n\nAkbar led an expedition to Gujarat where Tamat Khan reportedly gave Akbar the keys to Gujarat (in reality just Ahmedabad). Akbar then conquered Surat and defeated Ibrahim Husain Mirza near Kathoti. Akbar then returned to Fatehpur Sikri with Rai Singh joining him en route in Ajmer. After a year, Rai Singh set out to crush Muhammad Shahs’ rebellion in Gujarat; Akbar joined the campaign in Jalor. For his services, Akbar rewarded Rai Singh with Nagaur, Sirsa and Marot. Prince Dalpat was put in charge of Sirsa.\n\nAround this time Kalyanmal, Bharmal and Narayan (a son of Bhimraj) died. Rai Singh then became ruler of Bikaner and Bhagwantdas the ruler of Amber. Seizing the opportunity, Dalpat took Hardesar and expelled Bhimraj's family.\n\nRai Singh (along with Shah Quli Khan and others) was assigned the task of capturing Siwana. The fort was being defended by Pata, brother-in-law of Rai Singh's minister, Karam Chand Bachhawat. He allowed supplies into the fort and sabotaged the siege. Meanwhile, Rai Singh's brother, Ram Singh defeated Chandrasen of Jodhpur at the battle of Kulanja valley. Akbar sent Shahbaz Khan to Siwana and instructed Rai Singh to return to the court. Shahbaz Khan cut off the supplies and captured the fort.\n\nThe \"Dalpat Vilas\" then delves into the ongoing intrigues in Bikaner. Friction is said to be present between Mantri Karam Chand and Rai Singh's mother with the minister keeping Rai Singh away from his mother. Karam Chand also sowed seeds of discord between Rai Singh and Prince Bhopat. After the Maharani herself brought Bhopat from Nagaur, the angry Rai Singh divested Bhopat of most of his retinue. Bhopat was sent to Bikaner in 1575 C.E. but after a good start he took to a life of profligate spending and drinking. When Rai Singh was visiting Bhadana, the Maharani brought the drunken Bhopat before his father. The enraged Rai Singh apparently appointed Ram Singh as Bhopat's guardian and sent them to Bikaner; Rai Singh proceeded to meet Akbar. Mahesh, Gogade and Jivraj (Bhopat's nobles) were assigned to accompany Dalpat instead.\n\nKaram Chand continued his efforts to bring harm to Bhopat. The prince had a poor appetite and Karam Chand appointed a physician to cure the problem by branding. In 1576, a hot iron was stated to have been applied to Bhopat's stomach. A similar branding was planned for the prince's back but was prevented by the prince's attendants. Despite all these machinations, Bhopat regained his health.\n\nIn 1578 C.E., Rai Singh requested Akbar that to be allowed to swap Merta for Jodhpur. Akbar assented and went to Malwa with Prince Bhopat. Prince Dalpat joined the Maharaja as he proceeded to Merta. On the way, Rai Singh stopped at Kantalya and raided Bansor. Dalpat Singh was then sent to Bikaner while Rai Singh sacked Chotila and Rohis. Dalpat went to Badhnau to have a feast at Ram Singh's house. The Prince then stayed at Kalyanpur for five days and joined Surtan, Prithiraj (brothers of Rai Singh) and assembled \"thakurs\" in a game of \"Chaugan\". Dalpat then returned to Badhnau.\n\nThe manuscript states that in this interim, the Jats of Nawa killed Mahesh. Many jats were then killed in revenge by Keshav, one of Ram Singh's Rajputs (nobles). Informed of this, Prince Dalpat rushed to intercept Keshav and reached Bigga. Keshav, however, had already returned to Kalyanpur and Dalpat returned to Bikaner. When Ram Singh and his brothers went to Sirohi, Keshav was asked to stay behind. Keshav, however, refused to obey and was allowed to join the party. Upon reaching Pali, Ram Singh wished for Keshav to proceed to Kumbhalmer and be assigned to Bhanji. Keshav again flouted the command and Ram Singh did not force the issue.\n\nAt Sirohi, Surtan (a \"thakur\" from Sirohi) had come to visit Maharaja Rai Singh. Surtan and Prince Bhopat were sent by Rai Singh to Akbar. Ram Singh and Prithiraj attended a feast hosted by Bija Deora. Ram Singh's partaking of a feast with Pushpavati's killers angered Rai Singh. He communicated his displeasure to Ram Singh and said that it would be difficult for him to live with his brother. In order to fulfill Rai Singh's wish, Ram Singh left Sirohi. After going only part of the way home, Ram Singh sent a message asking for forgiveness. Rai Singh relented and Ram Singh returned to Sirohi.\n\nMaharaja Rai Singh took his \"savars\" (horsemen) for inspection by Akbar's \"Bakshi\". At the inspection. Ram Singh's horsemen followed the protocol by dismounting, leading the horses by the reins, saluting and circling back. Keshav, however, did not dismount and merely galloped away. Rai Singh gave orders for Keshav to be killed but he escaped by staying close to Ram Singh. This led to Ram Singh also becoming the target of Rai Singh's wrath. At this point, the Maharani, not wishing to see fratricide, sent Ram Singh away.\n\nAmra (a brother of Rai Singh) had been stealing camels belonging to the Emperor. Dalpat was sent by Rai Singh to have the camels freed and Amra expelled. Dalpat did not find Amra at Sidhu and went to Badhsar and rounded up some of Raghodas’ men (Raghodas was a son of Kalyanmal). The men were released after some mild punishment. Rai Singh again sent word to Dalpat that the Amra matter had to be dealt with. Dalpat went to sack Amra's village and gave the residents opportunity to leave. After the offer was refused, a short skirmish followed and Dalpat's victorious force set fire to the village. Ram Singh and Amra were meanwhile headed from Bikaner after leaving Rai Singh. The news of Amra's village being attacked reached the duo, Amra wished to return to his village. Ram Singh, however, sent a communication to Prince Dalpat and headed to Nohar with the pack animals.\n\nRam Singh became disillusioned with the world after his wife Amba (daughter of Rana Uday Singh) died. Ram Singh had asked Surtan and Prithiraj to cease their depredations in Bikaner. Surtan and Prithiraj, however, continued to seize animals from villagers. Ram Singh decided to end his life like a true Rajput by dying in battle. Dalpat's advisers also wished to get rid of Ram Singh. After inciting Dalpat through invectives, Ram Singh reached Rajadwala. Dalpat's forces attacked and the valorous Ram Singh was killed. Prithiraj and Surtan were allowed by Dalpat to take their possessions to Nohar. After a few days, Prithiraj, Surtan and Amra resumed atrocities in the Bhatner area. Dalpat sent a force against them, but Prithiraj and Surtan went to plead their case before the Emperor. Akbar summoned Dalpat and the prince went to the Imperial court. After returning to Bikaner, the young prince married the daughters of Rupsi and Chauhan Ramdas. Dalpat then joined Akbar's retinue near Rewari. Akbar proceeded to visit several towns, Prince Bhopat was left at Tehad after he developed smallpox. News of Prince Bhopat's death arrived as Akbar reached Shekana-pattan.\n\nAkbar next traveled via Chandnot (Chiniot) and Hazara to Bhere (Bhera), there animals for the hunt had been collected near Girjhak (present day Jalalpur). While Akbar went deer hunting, the nobles played a game of \" kabaddi\" dressed in their \"kachhas\" (underwear). Upon returning from the hunt, the Emperor did not join the game but went to the tent of Shekh Jamal. All the nobles dressed and went to pay their respects to Akbar. After some time, Akbar went to bathe in the river (the Jhelum). Akbar's son, Salim was hesitant to enter the river. Akbar, therefore, dunked Salim in the river a few times. The Rajput noble, Danji received four to five lashes from Akbar's whip as he was late. Pritihidip and his advisers also felt the sting of Akbar's whip. Randhirot (Prithidip's uncle) was also whipped as it was found that he had detained Prithidip. Upon being whipped, Randhirot stabbed himself in the belly. Akbar was further enraged and ordered Randhirot to be trampled to death by an elephant. This order could not be carried out as the elephant did not move to trample Randhirot.\n\nAt this juncture, the irritated Akbar went to enjoy the company of his ladies. The nobles also returned to their respective tents. Man Singh arrived at the camp in the afternoon and went to pay his respects to Akbar. Akbar told Man Singh to have Randhirot looked after, however, the Rajput was already dead.\n\nDalpat, Man Singh and Madhav Singh went to see the Emperor and found him to be in a foul mood. Akbar reportedly started shouting and said that Hindus should eat cows and Muslims should eat pigs. He also took off his turban and asked for a barber to shave his head. The panic stricken barber ran away and Akbar started to trim his own hair with a dagger. Shah Fatahulla intervened and took the dagger from Akbar's hand. All the assembled Muslim and Rajput nobles were then ordered to take off their turbans. The Emperor then had his hair cropped and started shouting again. He praised the Rathores and Rajawats but called the Shekhawats mere Jats. With difficulty, Shah Fatahulla took Akbar to the sleeping quarters.\n\nIn the morning, the Rajput nobles prayed to their deities and waited. Akbar had his beard shaved and saying that he would invade \"Firang\" he permitted the nobles to leave their beards intact. Akbar then took off his turban and tore it into strips. Each Hindu chieftain was given a strip from the turban and had \"Gangajal\" (water from the holy Ganges) placed on his palm. Prince Dalpat also received a strip of Akbar's turban.\n\nThe animals were then released and Akbar rested for five days. On the sixth day, Akbar had his beard shaved and all the nobles also had their beards shaved. The Emperor then proceeded towards Fatehpur Sikri. En route, the party camped near Ramgarh after crossing the Chahnal river. Raja Bhagwantdas came to meet Akbar at the encampment. Akbar rebuked Bhagwantdas and Man Singh for abandoning the siege of Kumbhalmer. Rumors flew in the camp that they had sustained heavy losses and were short of supplies. In truth ( per the \"Akbarnama\") Shahbaz Khan sent them back as he suspected that the two would be less than industrious in their efforts against the Rana (Rana Pratap). At the camp, Prince Dalpat noticed a Rajput holding a dagger and moving towards Kunwar Man Singh. Dalpat raised an alarm, and the person was intercepted by Rav Durga.\n\nThe fragmentary manuscript ends at this point, the contents of the missing portion are unknown.\n\nThe genealogy of the Rathores and the Sur dynasty as described in the \"Dalpat Vilas\", are in keeping with other historical sources. The story of Sher Shah Suri repaying a debt of gratitude is uncorroborated. The manuscript ascribes Hemu's killing to Akbar's nobles, this is consistent with the version in the writings of Abul Fazl, Badaoni and others. Akbar's visit to Nagaur is also mentioned in the \"Akbarnama\" while the siege of Siwana is also spoken of by Abul Fazl.\n\nAkbar's unusual behavior at the Qamargah hunt of 1579 is mentioned in the \"Akbarnama\" and by Badaoni. The rather detailed description of the happenings ( in the \"Dalpat Vilas\" ) suggest that the author was actually present at the scene.\n\nThe \"Dalpat Vilas\" blames Karam Chand Bachhawat Mehta for Maharaja Rai Singh's failure to capture Siwana, the death of Ram Singh and other problems of the state. In regard to siege of Siwana, Rai Singh was a good commander in open field warfare but less experienced in conducting a siege. Informed of this, Akbar sent Shahbaz Khan to conduct the siege. Karam Chand Bachhawat Mehta was a capable minister and found employment with the Emperor after leaving Bikaner.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "265006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265006", "title": "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems", "text": "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\n\nThe Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (\"Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo\") is a 1632 Italian-language book by Galileo Galilei comparing the Copernican system with the traditional Ptolemaic system. It was translated into Latin as \"Systema cosmicum\" () in 1635 by Matthias Bernegger. The book was dedicated to Galileo's patron, Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who received the first printed copy on February 22, 1632.\n\nIn the Copernican system, the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, while in the Ptolemaic system, everything in the Universe circles around the Earth. The \"Dialogue\" was published in Florence under a formal license from the Inquisition. In 1633, Galileo was found to be \"vehemently suspect of heresy\" based on the book, which was then placed on the \"Index of Forbidden Books\", from which it was not removed until 1835 (after the theories it discussed had been permitted in print in 1822). In an action that was not announced at the time, the publication of anything else he had written or ever might write was also banned in Catholic countries.\n\nWhile writing the book, Galileo referred to it as his \"Dialogue on the Tides\", and when the manuscript went to the Inquisition for approval, the title was \"Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea\". He was ordered to remove all mention of tides from the title and to change the preface because granting approval to such a title would look like approval of his theory of the tides using the motion of the Earth as proof. As a result, the formal title on the title page is \"Dialogue\", which is followed by Galileo's name, academic posts, and followed by a long subtitle. The name by which the work is now known was extracted by the printer from the description on the title page when permission was given to reprint it with an approved preface by a Catholic theologian in 1744. This must be kept in mind when discussing Galileo's motives for writing the book. Although the book is presented formally as a consideration of both systems (as it needed to be in order to be published at all), there is no question that the Copernican side gets the better of the argument.\n\nThe book is presented as a series of discussions, over a span of four days, among two philosophers and a layman:\n\n\nThe discussion is not narrowly limited to astronomical topics, but ranges over much of contemporary science. Some of this is to show what Galileo considered good science, such as the discussion of William Gilbert's work on magnetism. Other parts are important to the debate, answering erroneous arguments against the Earth's motion.\n\nA classic argument against earth motion is the lack of speed sensations of the earth surface, though it moves, by the earth's rotation, at about 1700 km/h at the equator. In this category there is a thought experiment in which a man is below decks on a ship and cannot tell whether the ship is docked or is moving smoothly through the water: he observes water dripping from a bottle, fish swimming in a tank, butterflies flying, and so on; and their behavior is just the same whether the ship is moving or not. This is a classic exposition of the Inertial frame of reference and refutes the objection that if we were moving hundreds of kilometres an hour as the Earth rotated, anything that one dropped would rapidly fall behind and drift to the west.\n\nThe bulk of Galileo's arguments may be divided into three classes:\n\n\nGenerally, these arguments have held up well in terms of the knowledge of the next four centuries. Just how convincing they ought to have been to an impartial reader in 1632 remains a contentious issue.\n\nGalileo attempted a fourth class of argument:\n\n\nAs an account of the causation of tides or a proof of the Earth's motion, it is a failure. The fundamental argument is internally inconsistent and actually leads to the conclusion that tides do not exist. But, Galileo was fond of the argument and devoted the \"Fourth Day\" of the discussion to it. The degree of its failure is—like nearly anything having to do with Galileo—a matter of controversy. On the one hand, the whole thing has recently been described in print as \"cockamamie.\" On the other hand, Einstein used a rather different description:\n\nIt was Galileo's longing for a mechanical proof of the motion of the earth which misled him into formulating a wrong theory of the tides. The \"fascinating arguments in the last conversation\" would hardly have been accepted as proof by Galileo, had his temperament not got the better of him. [Emphasis added]\nThe \"Dialogue\" does not treat the Tychonic system, which was becoming the preferred system of many astronomers at the time of publication and which was ultimately proven incorrect. The Tychonic system is a motionless Earth system but not a Ptolemaic system; it is a hybrid system of the Copernican and Ptolemaic models. Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun (as in the Copernican system) in small circles, while the sun in turn orbits a stationary Earth; Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn orbit the Sun in much larger circles, which means they also orbit the earth. The Tychonian system is mathematically equivalent to the Copernican system, except that the Copernican system predicts a stellar parallax, while the Tychonian system predicts no stellar parallax. Stellar parallax was not measurable until the 19th century, and therefore there was at the time no valid disproof of the Tychonic system on empirical grounds, nor any decisive observational evidence for the Copernican system.\n\nGalileo never took Tycho's system seriously, as can be seen in his correspondence, regarding it as an inadequate and physically unsatisfactory compromise. A reason for the absence of Tycho's system (in spite of many references to Tycho and his work in the book) may be sought in Galileo's theory of the tides, which provided the original title and organizing principle of the \"Dialogue\". For, while the Copernican and Tychonic systems are equivalent geometrically, they are quite different dynamically. Galileo's tidal theory entailed the actual, physical movement of the Earth; that is, if true, it would have provided the kind of proof that Foucault's pendulum apparently provided two centuries later. With reference to Galileo's tidal theory, there would be no difference between the Ptolemaic and Tychonic systems.\n\nGalileo also fails to discuss the possibility of non-circular orbits, although Kepler's proposal of an elliptical orbit for Mars had been published in 1609. Prince Cesi's letter to Galileo of 1612 treated the two laws of 1609 as common knowledge. Kepler's third law was published in 1619. A heliocentric system with planets in approximately elliptical orbits is deducible from Newton's laws of motion and gravity, but these were not published until 1687.\n\nPreface: To the Discerning Reader\nrefers to the ban on the \"Pythagorean opinion that the earth moves\" and says that the author \"takes the Copernican side with a pure mathematical hypothesis\". He introduces the friends Sagredo and Salviati with whom he had had discussions as well as the peripatetic philosopher Simplicio.\n\nHe starts with Aristotle's proof of the completeness and perfection of the world (i.e. the universe) because of its three dimensions. Simplicio points out that three was favoured by the Pythagoreans whereas Salviati can't understand why three legs are better than two or four. He suggests that the numbers were \"trifles which later spread among the vulgar\" and that their definitions, such as those of straight lines and right angles, were more useful in establishing the dimensions. Simplicio's response was that Aristotle thought that in physical matters mathematical demonstration wasn't always needed. \n\nSalviati attacks Aristotle's definition of the heavens as incorruptible and unchanging whilst only the lunar-bound zone shows change. He points to the changes seen in the skies: the new stars of 1572 and 1604 and sunspots, seen through the new telescope. There is a discussion about Aristotle's use of \"a priori\" arguments. Salviati suggests that he uses his experience to choose an appropriate argument to prove just as others do and that he would change his mind in the present circumstances.\n\nSimplicio argues that sunspots could simply be small opaque objects passing in front of the sun, but Salviati points out that some appear or disappear randomly and those at the edge are flattened, unlike separate bodies. Therefore, \"it is better Aristotelian philosophy to say 'Heaven is alterable because my senses tell me' than 'Heaven is unalterable because Aristotle was so persuaded by reasoning'\".\n\nExperiments with a mirror are used to show that the moon's surface must be opaque and not a perfect crystal sphere as Simplicio believes. He refuses to accept that mountains on the moon cause shadows, or that reflected light from the earth is responsible for the faint outline in a crescent moon.\n\nSagredo holds that he considers the earth noble because of the changes in it whereas Simplicio says that change in the moon or stars would be useless because they do not benefit man. Salviati points out that days on the moon are a month long and despite the varied terrain that the telescope has disclosed, it wouldn't sustain life. Humans acquire mathematical truths slowly and hesitantly, whereas God knows the full infinity of them intuitively. And when one looks into the marvellous things men have understood and contrived, then clearly the human mind is one of the most excellent of God's works.\n\nSalviati starts by repeating that Aristotle would be changing his opinions if he saw what they were seeing. \"It is the followers of Aristotle who have crowned him with authority, not he who has usurped or appropriated it to himself.\"\n\nThere is one supreme motion—that by which the sun, moon, planets and fixed stars appear to be moved from east to west in the space of 24 hours. This may as logically belong to the earth alone as to the rest of the universe. Aristotle and Ptolemy, who understood this, do not argue against any other motion than this diurnal one.\n\nMotion is relative: the position of the sacks of grain on a ship can be identical at the end of the voyage despite the movement of the ship. Why should we believe that nature moves all these extremely large bodies with inconceivable velocities rather than simply moving the moderately sized earth? If the earth is removed from the picture, what happens to all the movement?\n\nThe movement of the skies from east to west is the opposite of all the other motions of the heavenly bodies which are from west to east; making the earth rotate brings it into line with all the others. Although Aristotle argues that circular motions are not contraries, they could still lead to collisions.\n\nThe great orbits of the planets take longer than the shorter: Saturn and Jupiter take many years, Mars two, whereas the moon takes only a month. Jupiter's moons take even less. This is not changed if the earth rotates every day, but if the earth is stationary then we suddenly find that the sphere of the fixed stars rotates in 24 hours. Given the distances, that would more reasonably be thousands of years.\n\nIn addition some of these stars have to travel faster than others: if the Pole Star was precisely at the axis, then it would be entirely stationary whereas those of the equator have unimaginable speed. The solidity of this supposed sphere is incomprehensible. Make the earth the primum mobile and the need for this extra sphere disappears.\nThey consider three main objections to the motion of the earth: that a falling body would be left behind by the earth and thus fall far to the west of its point of release; that a cannonball fired to the west would similarly fly much further than one fired to the east; and that a cannonball fired vertically would also land far to the west. Salviati shows that these do not take account of the impetus of the cannon.\n\nHe also points out that attempting to prove that the earth doesn't move by using vertical fall commits the logical fault of paralogism (assuming what is to be proved), because if the earth is moving then it is only in appearance that it is falling vertically; in fact it is falling at a slant, as happens with a cannonball rising through the cannon (illustrated).\n\nIn rebutting a work which claims that a ball falling from the moon would take six days to arrive, the odd-number rule is introduced: a body falling 1 unit in an interval would fall 3 units in the next interval, 5 units in the subsequent one, etc. This gives rise to the rule by which the distance fallen is according to the square of the time. Using this he calculates the time is really little more than 3 hours. He also points out that density of the material doesn't make much difference: a lead ball might only accelerate twice as fast as one of cork.\n\nIn fact, a ball falling from such a height wouldn't fall behind but ahead of the vertical because the rotational motion would be in ever-decreasing circles. What makes the earth move is similar to whatever moves Mars or Jupiter and is the same as that which pulls the stone to earth. Calling it gravity doesn't explain what it is.\n\nSalviati starts by dismissing the arguments of a book against the novas he has been reading overnight. Unlike comets, these were stationary and their lack of parallax easily checked and thus could not have been in the sublunary sphere.\n\nSimplicio now gives the greatest argument against the annual motion of the earth that if it moves then it can no longer be the center of the zodiac, the world. Aristotle gives proofs that the universe is finite bounded and spherical. Salvatius points out that these disappear if he denies him the assumption that it is movable, but allows the assumption initially in order not to multiply disputes.\nHe points out that if anything is the centre, it must be the sun not the earth, because all the planets are closer or further away from the earth at different times, Venus and Mars up to eight times. He encourages Simplicio to make a plan of the planets, starting with Venus and Mercury which are easily seen to rotate about the sun. Mars must also go about the sun (as well as the earth) since it is never seen horned, unlike Venus now seen through the telescope; similarly with Jupiter and Saturn. Earth, which is between Mars with a period of two years and Venus with nine months, has a period of a year which may more elegantly be attributed to motion than a state of rest.\n\nSagredo brings up two other common objections. If the earth rotated, the mountains would soon be in a position that one would have to descend them rather than ascend. Secondly, the motion would be so rapid that someone at the bottom of a well would have only a brief instance to glimpse a star as it traversed. Simplicio can see that the first is no different from travelling over the globe, as any who have circumnavigated but though he realises the second is the same as if the heavens were rotating, he still doesn't understand it. Salviati says the first is no different from those who deny the antipodes. For the second, he encourages Simplicio to decide what fraction of the sky can be seen from down the well.\n\nSalviati brings up another problem, which is that Mars and Venus are not as variable as the theory would suggest. He explains that the size of a star to the human eye is affected by the brightness and the sizes are not real. This is resolved by use of the telescope which also shows the crescent shape of Venus. A further objection to the movement of the earth, the unique existence of the moon, has been resolved by the discovery of the moons of Jupiter, which would appear like our moon to any Jovian.\nCopernicus has succeeded in reducing some of the uneven motions of Ptolemy who had to deal with motions that sometimes go fast, sometimes slow, and sometimes backwards, by means of vast epicycles. Mars, above the sun's sphere, often falls far below it, then soars above it. These anomalies are cured by the annual movement of the earth. This is explained by a diagram in which the varying motion of Jupiter is shown using the earth's orbit.\n\nSimplicio produces another booklet in which theological arguments are mixed with astronomic, but Salviati refuses to address the issues from Scripture. So he produces the argument that the fixed stars must be at an inconceivable distance with the smallest larger than the whole orbit of the earth. Salviati explains that this all comes from a misrepresentation of what Copernicus said, resulting in a huge over-calculation of the size of a sixth magnitude star. But many other famous astronomers over-estimated the size of stars by ignoring the brightness factor. Not even Tycho, with his accurate instruments, set himself to measure the size of any star except the sun and moon. But Salviati (Galileo) was able to make a reasonable estimate simply by hanging a cord to obscure the star and measuring the distance from eye to cord.\n\nBut still many cannot believe that the fixed stars can individually be as big or bigger than the sun. To what end are these? Salviati maintains that \"it is brash for our feebleness to attempt to judge the reasons for God's actions, and to call everything in the universe vain and superfluous which does not serve us\".\n\nHas Tycho or any of his disciples tried to investigate in any way phenomena that might affirm or deny the movement of the earth? Do any of them know how much variation is needed in the fixed stars? Simplicio objects to conceding that the distance of the fixed stars is too great for it to be detectable. Salviati points out how difficult it is even to detect the varying distances of Saturn. Many of the positions of the fixed stars are not known accurately and far better instruments than Tycho's are needed: say using a sight with a fixed position 60 miles away.\n\nSagredo then asks Salviati to explain how the Copernican system explains the seasons and inequalities of night and day. This he does with the aid of a diagram showing the position of the earth in the four seasons. He points out how much simpler it is than the Ptolemaic system. But Simplicio thinks Aristotle was wise to avoid too much geometry. He prefers Aristotle's axiom to avoid more than one simple motion at a time.\n\nThey are in Sagredo's house in Venice, where tides are an important issue, and Salviati wants to show the effect of the earth's movement on the tides. He first points out the three periods of the tides: \"daily (diurnal)\", generally with intervals of 6 hours of rising and six more of falling; \"monthly\", seemingly from the moon, which increases or decreases these tides; and \"annual\", leading to different sizes at the equinoxes.\n\nHe considers first the daily motion. Three varieties are observed: in some places the waters rise and fall without any forward motion; in others they move towards the east and back to the west without rising or falling; in still others there is a combination of both—this happens in Venice where the waters rise on entering and fall on leaving. In the Straits of Messina there are very swift currents between Scylla and Charybdis. In the open Mediterranean the alteration of height is small but the currents are noticeable.\n\nSimplicio counters with the peripatetic explanations, which are based on the depths of the sea, and the dominion of the moon over the water, though this doesn't explain the risings when the moon is below the horizon. But he admits it could be a miracle.\n\nWhen the water in Venice rises, where does it come from? There is little rise in Corfu or Dubrovnik. From the ocean through the Straits of Gibraltar? It's much too far away and the currents are too slow.\n\nSo could the movement of the container cause the disturbance? Consider the barges that bring water into Venice. When they hit an obstacle, the water rushes forward; when they speed up it will go to the back. For all this disturbance there is no need for new water and the level in the middle stays largely constant though the water there rushes backwards and forwards.\n\nConsider a point on the earth under the joint action of the annual and diurnal movements. At one time these are added together and 12 hours later they act against each other, so there is an alternate speeding up and slowing down. So the ocean basins are affected in the same way as the barge particularly in an east-west direction. Note also that the length of the barge makes a difference to the speed of oscillations, just as the length of a plumb bob changes its speed. The depth of water also makes a difference to the size of vibrations.\n\nThe primary effect only explains tides once a day; one must look elsewhere for the six-hour change, to the oscillation periods of the water. In some places, such as the Hellespont and the Aegean the periods are briefer and variable. But a north-south sea like the Red Sea has very little tide whereas the Messina Strait carries the pent up effect of two basins.\n\nSimplicio objects that if this accounts for the water, should it not even more be seen in the winds? Salviati suggests that the containing basins are not so effective and the air does not sustain its motion. Nevertheless, these forces are seen by the steady winds from east to west in the oceans in the torrid zone.\n\nIt seems that the moon also is taking part in the production of the daily effects, but that is repugnant to his mind. The motions of the moon have caused great difficulty to astronomers. It's impossible to make a full account of these things given the irregular nature of the sea basins.\n\n\n"}

After graduating from high school in Braşov at age 11 in 1922, he published his first poems five years later in the literary review \"Viaţa literară\". His first book of poetry, \"Schituri cu soare\" (\"Sketes with Sun\"), appeared in 1929, the year he moved to Bucharest to study law at the University of Bucharest. He published another volume of poems, \"Inimi sub săbii\" (\"Hearts under Swords\") in 1934, but Jebeleanu's principal literary activity in the 1930s was as a journalist closely allied with the left-wing press.\n\nAfter World War II, he solidly supported the new Communist leadership and ardently promoted socialist realism. Most of his postwar poetry deals with the struggle against fascism, the Romanian revolutionary tradition going back to 1848, and championing the new regime's ideology. Despite his political engagement, his poetry rose above the level of a verse pamphleteer. His postwar volumes of poetry include \"Ceea ce nu se uită\" (\"What Cannot Be Forgotten\", 1945); \"Scutul păcii\" (\"The Shield of Peace\", 1949); \"Poeme de pace şi de luptă\" (\"Poems of Peace and War\", 1950); \"În satul lui Sahia\" (\"In Sahia's Village\", 1952); \"Bălcescu\" (1952), a long poem written in honour of the historian and revolutionary Nicolae Bălcescu; and \"Cîntecele pădurii tinere\" (\"Songs of the Young Forest\", 1953).\n\nJebeleanu first achieved international recognition with his collection of humanitarian poems about the atomic bombing of Hiroshima: \"Surîsul Hiroşimei\" (\"The Smile of Hiroshima\", 1958). After an \"oratorio\" celebrating the liberation at the end of the war, \"Oratoriul eliberării\" (\"The Oratorio of Liberation\", 1959), and a volume of selected verse, \"Poezii şi poeme\" (\"Poems\", 1961), he published one of his most highly regarded collections of poems, \"Lidice, Cîntece împotriva morţii\" (\"Lidice, Songs against Death\", 1963). In the same spirit of universal humanism as \"Surîsul Hiroşimei\", his new collection was inspired by a postwar visit to the site of the Czech village of Lidice, which together with its inhabitants was totally destroyed by the Nazis during World War II as an act of revenge.\n\nJebeleanu's other publications include \"Din veacul XX\" (\"From the Twentieth Century\", 1956), a collection of journalistic texts; \"Poeme, 1944-1964\" (\"Poems, 1944-1964\", 1964); \"Elegie pentru floarea secerată\" (\"Elegy for the Cut Flower\", 1966), one of his important collections of lyrics and a break from his previous engaged poetry; \"Hanibal\" (\"Hannibal\", 1972), a volume of poems; and \"Deasupra zilei\" (\"Above the Day\", 1981), a book of \"jottings\" on various subjects. In the 1970s, the Romanian Academy, of which he was a member, nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nAlthough initially a supporter of the regime, he expressed alarm after the July Theses were issued in 1971, and, considered one of the leaders of the liberal wing of the Writers' Union of Romania, was dropped from the Romanian Communist Party's central committee at its 13th Congress in 1984.\n\nJebeleanu translated poetry from six languages, including Hungarian (Petőfi), Turkish, French (Hugo) and German (Rilke). Three poems of his appeared in English in a 1969 anthology, and five more in 1985. In 2007, his last collection of poems, \"Armă secretă\" (\"Secret Weapon\", 1980), appeared in English, the first full volume of his work to do so. His son Tudor is a graphic artist. He and his wife Florica (\"née\" Cordescu), a painter who died in 1965, also had a daughter, Florica.\n\nOne of his hobbies was recreational fishing.\n\n"}

{"id": "1187373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1187373", "title": "Francisca", "text": "Francisca\n\nThe francisca (or francesca) is a throwing axe used as a weapon during the Early Middle Ages by the Franks, among whom it was a characteristic national weapon at the time of the Merovingians from about 500 to 750 and is known to have been used during the reign of Charlemagne (768–814).\nAlthough generally associated with the Franks, it was also used by other Germanic peoples of the period, including the Anglo-Saxons; several examples have been found in England.\n\nThe term \"francisca\" first appeared in the book \"Etymologiarum sive originum, libri XVIII\" by Isidore of Seville (c. 560–636) as a name used in Hispania to refer to these weapons \"because of their use by the Franks\".\n\nThe historian Gregory of Tours (c. 538–594) in his \"History of the Franks\" uses two Latin terms for the Frankish axe: \"securis\" and \"bipennis\".\n\nThe régime of Vichy France used the image of a stylised double-headed \"francisque\" as part of its iconography (compare fasces).\n\nThe francisca is characterized by its distinctly arch-shaped head, widening toward the cutting edge and terminating in a prominent point at both the upper and lower corners. The top of the head is usually either S-shaped or with the lower portion curving inward and forming an elbow with the short wooden haft. Sometimes the head is more upswept, forming a wider angle with the haft. Most franciscas have a round or teardrop-shaped eye designed to fit the tapered haft, similar to Viking axes. Based on the measurements of modern replicas, the francisca had a haft length of around 40–45 cm (16–18 in) and a 10 cm (4 in) cutting edge with an average weight of around 600 g (21 oz, 1.3 lb). Based on the surviving heads of franciscas recovered at Burgh Castle and Morning Thorpe in county Norfolk, England, the length of the head itself measured 14–15 cm (5–6 in) from the edge to the back of the socket.\n\nThe Byzantine historian Procopius (c. 500–565) described the Franks and their use of throwing axes:\n\nProcopius makes it clear that the Franks threw their axes immediately before hand to hand combat with the purpose of breaking shields and disrupting the enemy line while possibly wounding or killing an enemy warrior. The weight of the head and length of the haft would allow the axe to be thrown with considerable momentum to an effective range of about 12 m (40 ft). Even if the edge of the blade were not to strike the target, the weight of the iron head could cause injury. The francisca also had a psychological effect, in that, on the throwing of the francisca, the enemy might turn and run in the fear that another volley was coming.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42628556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42628556", "title": "Gender bias on Wikipedia", "text": "Gender bias on Wikipedia\n\nGender bias on Wikipedia reflects the fact that a dominant majority of volunteer Wikipedia editors, particularly on the English-language site, are male. This has led to Wikipedia having fewer and less extensive articles about women or topics important to women.\n\nIt figures among the most frequent criticisms of Wikipedia, and part of a more general criticism about systemic bias in Wikipedia. The Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, agrees with these criticisms and has made an ongoing attempt to increase female editorship of Wikipedia. Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.\n\nThe \"vast majority of [Wikipedia] editors are young, college-educated males\", a demographic which has been described as \"a bunch of male geeks who are wealthy enough to afford a $2,000 laptop and a broadband connection.\" Surveys have indicated that between 8.5% and 16% of Wikipedia editors are female. Consequently, Wikipedia has been criticized by some academics and journalists for having primarily male contributors, and for having fewer and less extensive articles about women or topics important to women. \"The New York Times\" pointed out that Wikipedia's female participation rate may be in line with other \"public thought-leadership forums\". In 2009, a Wikimedia Foundation survey revealed that 6% of editors who made more than 500 edits were female, with the average male editor having twice as many edits.\n\nIn the English Wikipedia and five other language editions that were studied by researchers, the ratio of articles about women to articles about men was higher than in three other databases. However, analysis with computational linguistics concluded that the way women and men are described in articles demonstrates bias, with articles about women more likely to overuse words relating to gender and family. The researchers believe that this is a sign Wikipedia editors consider male the \"null gender\" (in other words, that \"male\" is assumed unless otherwise specified). Another critique of Wikipedia's approach, from a 2014 \"Guardian\" editorial, is that it has difficulty making judgments about \"what matters\". To illustrate this point they noted that the page listing pornographic actresses was better organized than the page listing women writers.\n\nIn 2010, United Nations University and UNU-MERIT jointly presented an overview of the results of a global Wikipedia survey. A 30 January 2011, \"New York Times\" article cited this Wikimedia Foundation collaboration, which indicated that fewer than 13% of contributors to Wikipedia are women. Sue Gardner, then executive director of the foundation, said that increasing diversity was about making the encyclopedia \"as good as it could be.\" Factors the article cited as possibly discouraging women from editing included the \"obsessive fact-loving realm\", associations with the \"hard-driving hacker crowd,\" and the necessity to be \"open to very difficult, high-conflict people, even misogynists”. In 2013, the results of the survey were challenged by Hill and Shaw using corrective estimation techniques to suggest upward corrections to the data from the survey and to recommend updates to the statistics being surveyed, giving 22.7% for adult US female editors and 16.1% overall.\n\nIn February 2011, \"The New York Times\" followed up with a series of opinions on the subject under the banner, \"Where Are the Women in Wikipedia?\" Susan C. Herring, a professor of information science and linguistics, said that she was not surprised by the Wikipedia contributors gender gap. She said that the often contentious nature of Wikipedia article \"talk\" pages, where article content is discussed, is unappealing to many women, \"if not outright intimidating.\" Joseph M. Reagle reacted similarly, saying that the combination of a \"culture of hacker elitism,\" combined with the disproportionate effect of high-conflict members (a minority) on the community atmosphere, can make it unappealing. He said, \"the ideology and rhetoric of freedom and openness can then be used (a) to suppress concerns about inappropriate or offensive speech as \"censorship\" and (b) to rationalize low female participation as simply a matter of their personal preference and choice.\" Justine Cassell said that although women are as knowledgeable as men, and as able to defend their point of view, \"it is still the case in American society that debate, contention, and vigorous defense of one’s position is often still seen as a male stance, and women’s use of these speech styles can call forth negative evaluations.\"\n\nThe \"International Journal of Communication\" published research by Reagle and Lauren Rhue that examined the coverage, gender representation, and article length of thousands of biographical subjects on the English-language Wikipedia and the online \"Encyclopædia Britannica\". They concluded that Wikipedia provided better coverage and longer articles in general, that Wikipedia typically has more articles on women than \"Britannica\" in absolute terms, but Wikipedia articles on women were more likely to be missing than articles on men relative to \"Britannica\". That is, Wikipedia dominated \"Britannica\" in biographical coverage, but more so when it comes to men. Similarly, one might say that \"Britannica\" is more balanced in whom it neglects to cover than Wikipedia. For both reference works, article length did not consistently differ by gender.\n\nIn April 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation conducted its first semi-annual Wikipedia survey. It suggested that 9% of Wikipedia editors are women. It also reported, \"Contrary to the perception of some, our data shows that very few women editors feel like they have been harassed, and very few feel Wikipedia is a sexualized environment.\" However, an October 2011 paper at the International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration found evidence that suggested that Wikipedia may have \"a culture that may be resistant to female participation\".\n\nA study published in 2014 found that there is also an \"Internet skills gap\" with regard to Wikipedia editors. The authors found that the most likely Wikipedia contributors are high-skilled men and that there is no gender gap among low-skilled editors, and concluded that the \"skills gap\" exacerbates the gender gap among editors. During 2010–14, women made up 61% of participants of the college courses arranged by the Wiki Education Foundation program that included editing Wikipedia as part of the curriculum. Their contributions were found to shift the Wikipedia content from pop-culture and STEM towards social sciences and humanities.\n\nIn 2016, Wagner et al. found linguistic gender bias manifest in family-, gender-, and relationship-related topics being more present in biographies about women, and in positive terms being more frequent in the biographies of men and negative terms more frequent in the biographies of women. The authors also found structural differences in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for information-seeking activities.\n\nA 2017 study found that women participating in an experiment by editing a Wikipedia-like site tended to view other editors as male, and to view their responses as more critical than if the other editor was gender-neutral. The study concluded that: \n\nA study by Ford and Wajcman observes that research on the gender bias continues to frame the problem as a deficit in women. In contrast, their central argument states that infrastructure studies in feminist technoscience allows the gender analysis to be taken to a further level. It looks at three issues within the infrastructure: content policies, software and the legalistic framework of operation. It suggests that progress can be made through altering that culture of knowledge production through encouraging alternate knowledge, reducing the technical barriers to editing, and addressing the complexity of Wikipedia policies.\n\nIn March 2018, mathematician Marie A. Vitulli wrote in \"Notices of the American Mathematical Society\", \"The percentage of women editors on Wikipedia remains dismally low.\"\n\nIn October 2018, when Donna Strickland won a Nobel Prize in Physics, numerous write-ups mentioned that she did not previously have a Wikipedia page. A draft had been submitted, but was rejected for not demonstrating \"significant coverage (not just passing mentions) about the subject\".\n\nSeveral causes for this gender disparity have been suggested. A 2010 study revealed a Wikipedia female participation rate of 13 percent, observed to be close to the 15 percent overall female participation rate of other \"public thought-leadership forums\". Wikipedia research fellow Sarah Stierch acknowledged that it is \"fairly common\" for Wikipedia contributors to remain gender-anonymous. A perceived unwelcoming culture and tolerance of violent and abusive language are also reasons put forth for the gender gap. According to a 2013 study, another cause of the gender gap in Wikipedia is the failure to attract and retain female editors, resulting in a negative impact on Wikipedia's coverage. As well, Wikipedia \"...editors that publicly identify as women face harassment\" from other Wikipedia editors.\n\nFormer Wikimedia Foundation executive director Sue Gardner cited nine reasons why women don't edit Wikipedia, culled from comments by female Wikipedia editors:\n\nLam \"et al\". suggest that there may be a culture which is non-inclusive of women on Wikipedia, which may be due to a disparity in male-to-female centric topics represented and edited, the tendency for female users to be more active in the social and community aspects of Wikipedia, an increased likelihood that edits by new female editors are reverted, and/or that articles with high proportions of female editors are more contentious.\n\nIn July 2014, the National Science Foundation announced that it would spend $200,000 to study systemic gender bias on Wikipedia. An article by Julia Adams and Hannah Brückner that was supported by the funding was published in 2015.\n\nOne concern is that articles about female subjects may be more likely to be tagged for deletion.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation has officially held, since at least 2011 when Gardner was executive director, that gender bias exists in the project. It has made some attempts to address it but Gardner has expressed frustration with the degree of success achieved. She has also noted that \"in the very limited leisure time women had, they tended to be more involved in social activities instead of editing Wikipedia. 'Women see technology more as a tool they use to accomplish tasks, rather than something fun in itself. In 2011, the Foundation set a target of having 25 percent of its contributors identifying as female by 2015. In August 2013, Gardner said, \"I didn't solve it. We didn't solve it. The Wikimedia Foundation didn't solve it. The solution won't come from the Wikimedia Foundation.\"\n\nWriting for \"Slate\" in 2011, Heather Mac Donald called Wikipedia's gender imbalance a \"non-problem in search of a misguided solution.\" Mac Donald asserted, \"The most straightforward explanation for the differing rates of participation in Wikipedia—and the one that conforms to everyday experience—is that, on average, males and females have different interests and preferred ways of spending their free time.\"\n\nIn August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales announced in a BBC interview the Wikimedia Foundation's plans for \"doubling down\" on the gender content gap at Wikipedia. Wales said the Foundation would be open to more outreach and more software changes.\n\nDedicated edit-a-thons have been organized to increase the coverage of women's topics in Wikipedia and to encourage more women to edit Wikipedia. These events are supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, which sometimes provides mentors and technology to help guide newer editors through the process. Recent edit-a-thons have given specific focus to topics such as Australian female neuroscientists and women in Jewish history.\n\nVisualEditor, a project funded by the Wikimedia Foundation that allows for WYSIWYG-style editing on Wikipedia, is said to be aimed in part at closing the gender gap.\n\nThe project was launched with the goal to provide a user-friendly environment for newcomers, with a particular goal of boosting women's participation in Wikipedia.\n\nAn early-2015 initiative to create a \"women-only\" space for Wikipedia editors was strongly opposed by Wikipedians.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, the WikiProject Women in Red was launched on the English-language version of Wikipedia, focusing on the creation of new articles about notable women. Mainly through its monthly virtual editathons, Women in Red encourages editors to participate in extending Wikipedia's coverage. Thanks in part to the efforts of this project, by June 2018 some 17,000 new women's biographies had been added to Wikipedia.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His operation was thought to be \"one of the largest and most sophisticated antiquities networks in the world, responsible for illegally digging up and spiriting away thousands of top-drawer pieces and passing them on to the most elite end of the international art market\".\n\nThanks to a long-running major investigation by the \"Tutela Patrimonio Culturale\" (or \"TCP\", the unit of the Italian Carabinieri (military police) specializing in protecting that country's cultural heritage), Giacomo Medici was eventually charged, tried and convicted for his key role in an extensive and highly lucrative international antiquities smuggling ring. \n\nFor nearly 40 years, the group organised the systematic looting and theft of some of the most valuable Mediterranean artefacts ever found, \"laundering\" these stolen objects through corrupt international dealers and major auction houses, who then sold them on to major institutions and collectors around the world. Probably the best-known object linked to the Medici gang is the so-called \"Sarpedon krater\", a unique, signed Attic \"red figure\" wine vessel dating from the 5th century BCE, which was painted by Euphronios, one of the most famous ceramic artists of the ancient world. The krater was eventually shown to have been looted from a previously unknown Etruscan tomb near Cerveteri, Italy, in December 1971, and later sold to the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1972 for the then record price of US$1 million.\n\nThe staggering scale and value of the so-called \"Medici conspiracy\" was revealed in the 1990s by two fortuitous but connected events. The first was the downfall of former Sotheby's employee James Hodges, who in 1991 was tried and convicted of various charges related to his theft of antiquities and money from his employer. Unfortunately for Sotheby's - but very fortunately for investigators - prior to his arrest, Hodges had stolen or photocopied a number of internal Sotheby's documents which indicated that the company was behaving dishonestly and unethically in regard to the trading of antiquities. After Hodges' crimes were discovered, he tried to make a deal, using the stolen documents as a bargaining tool, but when Sotheby's refused, Hodges took revenge by passing the material to investigative journalist Peter Watson. Hodges' documents sparked a series of British press investigations into Sotheby's activities, and although not conclusive in their own right, they would also provide vital corroboration for the even more sensational discoveries made by Italian authorities in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe second fortuitous event was the death of one of the smuggling ring's main organisers, Pasquale Camera, a former captain in the Italian customs agency. When Camera was killed in a car accident in August 1995, police found dozens of photographs of stolen antiquities in the glove compartment of his car, which directly linked Camera to a recent theft of valuable antiquities from an Italian regional museum. Subsequent raids by the TCP uncovered a large hoard of stolen and looted antiquities of the highest quality, as well as an extraordinary collection of documents and photographs that chronicled the smuggling ring's operations in forensic detail. Most importantly of all, the raid on the Rome apartment of one of the smugglers yielded a crucial piece of evidence that enabled the TCP to break the entire ring wide open - it was a comprehensive organisational chart, handwritten by Camera himself, which named and linked every major player in the operation, including the gangs of \"tombaroli\" (tomb robbers) and their leaders, the middle-men (including Medici) who smuggled the looted treasures out of Italy and other countries, the corrupt international dealers (including British dealer Robin Symes and American dealer Robert E. Hecht) who traded the stolen goods through major auction houses - notably Sotheby's in London - and even the unscrupulous curators, institutions, and private collectors who purchased looted goods from the gang. \n\nThe paperwork also revealed that a Swiss-based holding company named Editions Services (the successor to his earlier Hydra Galleries in Rome) was operated by a \"frontman\" on Medici's behalf, that Editions Services shared the same Zurich address with the antiques company owned by British dealer Robin Symes, and that Editions Services had sold three ancient marble sculptures previously stolen from an Italian collection. On September 13, 1995, Italian and Swiss police raided the Editions Services offices in Geneva, Switzerland which were located in Port Franc, \"the special commercial zone near the airport where international goods can be stored, bought, and sold, discreetly and tax-free\".\n\nAuthorities found \"hundreds of pieces of ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art — including a set of Etruscan dinner plates valued at $2 million ... voluminous sales records and correspondence between Medici and dealers in London and New York; and finally, binders and boxes containing thousands of photographs ... of ancient objects ... the archive included sequential photographs of single pieces from the moment they came out of the ground ... to their finished, reconstructed appearance at the time they entered the art market and were sold for tens of thousands, and occasionally millions, of dollars. In a few cases there were even subsequent photos of the same objects inside the display cases of well-known museums\". The forensic archaeologists investigating the Medici documents even discovered shocking photographic evidence that the gang had illegally excavated and looted at least one previously-undiscovered Roman villa in Pompeii, ruthlessly hacking several complete frescoes off the walls in laptop-sized pieces in order to steal them.\n\nMedici was formally arrested in 1997, and in 2004 was sentenced by a Rome court to ten years in prison and a fine of 10 million Euros, \"the largest penalty ever meted out for antiquities crime in Italy\".\n\nIn 2005, evidence from the Geneva raid was used by the Italian government to indict American antiquities dealer Robert E. Hecht and former J. Paul Getty Museum curator of antiquities Marion True for conspiracy to traffic in illegal antiquities. The court hearings of the case against Hecht and True ended in 2012 and 2010, respectively, as the statute of limitations, under Italian law, for their alleged crimes had expired.\n\nMedici's operation is detailed in Peter Watson and Cecilia Todeschini's 2006 book \"The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2814304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2814304", "title": "Grendel's mother", "text": "Grendel's mother\n\nGrendel's mother () is one of three antagonists in the anonymous Old English poem \"Beowulf\" (c. 700–1000 AD). The other antagonists are Grendel and the dragon, all aligned in opposition to the hero Beowulf. She is introduced in lines 1258b to 1259a as: \"Grendles modor/ides, aglæcwif\".\n\nGrendel's mother, who is never given a name in the text, is the subject of ongoing controversy among medieval scholars. This is due to the ambiguity of a few words in Old English which appear in the original \"Beowulf\" manuscript. While there is consensus over the word \"modor\" (mother), the phrase \"ides, aglæcwif\" is the subject of scholarly debate.\n\nThe poem, \"Beowulf,\" is contained in the Nowell Codex. As noted in lines 106–114 and lines 1260–1267 of \"Beowulf,\" monsters (which include Grendel's mother and Grendel) are descendants of Cain. After Grendel is killed, Grendel's mother attacks Heorot in revenge. Beowulf then ventures into her cave under a lake, and engages in fierce combat with Grendel's mother. She nearly kills him until he sees an ancient sword, which he kills her with, and beheads the dead Grendel. Beowulf then returns to the surface and to his men at the \"ninth hour\" (l. 1600, \"nōn\", about 3 pm).\n\nSome scholars have argued that the female characters in \"Beowulf\" fulfill certain established roles such as \"hostess\" (Wealhþeow and Hygd) and peace-weaver (Freawaru and Hildeburh). Grendel's mother and Modthryth (before her marriage to Offa), who challenge these roles, represent \"monster-women\".\n\nJane Chance argues in \"The Structural Unity of \"Beowulf\": The Problem of Grendel's Mother\" that there are two standard interpretations of the poem: one view which suggests a two-part structure (i.e., the poem is divided between Beowulf's battles with Grendel and with the dragon) and the other, a three-part structure (this interpretation argues that Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother is structurally separate from his battle with Grendel). Chance stated that, \"this view of the structure as two-part has generally prevailed since its inception in J. R. R. Tolkien's \"\" in \"Proceedings of the British Academy 22\" (1936).\" In contrast, she argued that the three-part structure has become \"increasingly popular\". She later developed this argument in \"Woman as Hero in Old English Literature.\"\n\nThere is ongoing debate among medieval scholars concerning the ambiguity of a few words in Old English (related to Grendel's mother) which appear in the original \"Beowulf manuscript\". Because these terms are ambiguous, scholars disagree over aspects of her nature and appearance. Indeed, because her exact appearance is never directly described in Old English by the original \"Beowulf\" poet, part of the debate revolves around what is known, namely her descent from the biblical Cain (who was the first murderer, according to the Abrahamic religions). For some scholars, this descent links her and Grendel to the monsters and giants of the \"Cain tradition,\" while others such as Kevin Kiernan in \"Grendel's Heroic Mother\" argue that there is \"plenty of evidence for defending Grendel's mother as a heroic figure\" as she \"accepted and adhered to the heroic ethic of the blood-feud, the main difference between Grendel's feckless feud with the noise at Heorot and his mother's purposeful one exacting retribution for the death of her son. In heroic terms, her vengeance for the death of her kinsman Grendel.\"\n\nThis lack of consensus has led to the production of a few seminal texts by scholars over the past few decades. One important focus of these articles and books concerns the numerous, and at times opposing, translations of especially the Old English compound \"ides aglæcwif\" (1259a).\n\nUntil the late 1970s, all scholarship on Grendel's mother and translations of the phrase \"aglæc-wif\" were influenced by the edition of noted \"Beowulf\" scholar Frederick Klaeber. His edition, \"Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg\", has been considered a standard in \"Beowulf\" scholarship since its first publication in 1922. According to Klaeber's glossary, \"aglæc-wif\" translates as: \"wretch, or monster of a woman\". Klaeber's glossary also defines \"aglæca/æglæca\" as \"monster, demon, fiend\" when referring to Grendel or Grendel's mother and as \"warrior, hero\" when referring to the character Beowulf.\n\nKlaeber has influenced many translations of \"Beowulf.\" Notable interpretations of \"aglæc-wif\" which follow Klaeber include \"monstrous hell bride\" (Heaney), \"monster-woman\" (Chickering) \"woman, monster-wife\" (Donaldson), \"Ugly troll-lady\" (Trask) and \"monstrous hag\" (Kennedy).\n\nDoreen M.E. Gillam's 1961 essay, \"The Use of the Term 'Æglæca' in Beowulf at Lines 893 and 2592,\" explores Klaeber's dual use of the term \"aglæca/æglæca\" for the heroes Sigemund and Beowulf as well as for Grendel and Grendel's mother. She argues that \"aglæca/æglæca\" is used in works besides \"Beowulf\" to reference both \"devils and human beings\". She further argues that this term is used to imply \"supernatural,\" \"unnatural\" or even \"inhuman\" characteristics, as well as hostility towards other creatures. Gillam suggests: \"Beowulf, the champion of men against monsters, is almost inhuman himself. [Aglæca/æglæca] epitomises, in one word, the altogether exceptional nature of the dragon fight. Beowulf, the champion of good, the 'monster' amongst men, challenges the traditional incarnation of evil, the Dragon: æglæca meets æglæcan.\"\n\nThe Old English \"ides\", Old High German \"itis\" and Old Norse \"dís\" are cognates that all mean \"lady,\" and \"idisi\" appears as the name of the Valkyries in the only surviving pagan source in Old High German, the \"Merseburg Incantations\". More generally, in Norse mythology, the \"Dísir\" ('ladies') are fate goddesses who can be both benevolent and antagonistic towards mortal people.\n\nConsequently, many have pointed out that \"dís\" is probably the original term for the valkyries (lit. \"choosers of the slain\"), which in turn would be a kenning for \"dís\".\n\nA few scholars have drawn from the work of Eric Stanley by exploring the term \"ides\" as \"lady\" when discussing Grendel's mother, such as Temple (\"Grendel's Lady-Mother,\" 1986) and Taylor (who argues in his 1994 essay that the term \"Ides\" indicates that \"Grendel's mother is a woman of inherently noble status.\") In addition, others have suggested that Grendel's mother may be associated with the Norse figures of the valkyries and of the goddess Gefion who may be an extension of Frigg and Freyja. Freyja, the daughter of the sea god Njörðr, was both a fertility goddess and a goddess of war, battle, death, seiðr, prophecy and was also sometimes associated with the valkyries and disir.\n\nNora Kershaw Chadwick (1959) and later Helen Damico in two works (\"Beowulf's Wealhtheow and the Valkyrie Tradition\" and \"The Valkyrie Reflex in Old English Literature\") argue that Grendel's mother may refer to the myth of the valkyries. Damico states:\n\nDamico later argues in \"Beowulf's Wealhtheow and the Valkyrie Tradition\" that Wealtheow and Grendel's mother represent different aspects of the valkyries.\n\nFrank Battaglia also draws on the term \"ides\" by pairing it with \"dis\". He notes that the \"dis\" were \"female guardian spirit[s]\" with \"power over the dead and choosing who would die. In this capacity [they] might be feared.\" Battaglia thus suggests that Grendel's mother is the Early Germanic goddess Gefion (whom he states was also a form of Nerthus and Freyja). He also argues that: \"in scaldic poetry the word \"dis\" means goddess [...] Freyia herself is called \"Vanadis,\" that is, \"dis\" of the Vanir, the Scandinavian chthonic, fertility deities.\" Battaglia then notes that Gefion is referenced five times in the poem: l.49 (\"géafon on gársecg\" – \"Gefion on the waves\"), l.362 (\"ofer geofenes begang\" – \"over Gefion's realm\"), l.515 (\"geofon ýþum\" – \"Gefion welled up in waves\"), l.1394 (\"né on gyfenes grund\" – \"Ground of Gefion\"), and l.1690 (\"gifen géotende\" – \"Gefion gushing\"). In addition, he indicates that \"in Old English poetry, geofon is a word for ocean which has been seen since Jakob Grimm (1968, 198) as related to the name Gefion of the Danish Earth Goddess ... power to divide land and sea is shown by representations of Gefion in Norse literature.\"\n\nContemporary scholars have suggested that the use of the term \"aglæcwif\" indicates that Grendel's mother is a woman warrior. In 1979, \"Beowulf\" scholars Kuhn and Stanley argued against Klaeber's reading of Grendel's mother. In \"Old English Aglaeca-Middle Irish Olach\" Sherman Kuhn questioned Klaeber's translations of both \"aglæc-wif\" and of \"aglæca / æglæca\" when referring to Grendel and Grendel's mother, stating that there are Thus Kuhn suggested aglæca should be defined as \"a fighter, valiant warrior, dangerous opponent, one who struggles fiercely\". He supported his argument by also stating that, \"if there were one clear instance of áglæca referring to an unwarlike monster, a peaceful demon, or the like, this definition would fall apart.\" Kuhn concluded that \n\nEric Stanley added to the debate by critiquing both Klaeber and Gillam: \n\nOther scholars have offered varying opinions on this topic. Christine Alfano also questioned standard translations related to Grendel's mother. She states that she found a \"noticeable disparity between the Grendel's mother originally created by the \"Beowulf\" poet and the one that occupies contemporary \"Beowulf\" translations. Instead of being what Sherman Kuhn calls a 'female warrior', the modern Grendel's mother is a monster. This assumption informs almost all areas of \"Beowulf\" scholarship, although there is little evidence for this characterization in the original Anglo-Saxon work.\" Melinda Menzer offered a different approach, suggesting that \"aglæcwif denotes a woman, a human female, who is also aglæca.\"\n\nThe \"Dictionary of Old English\", University of Toronto, made the following updates in 1994:\n\nThe 1994 DOE translations were supported by George Jack in his 1997 glossary of \"Beowulf\" and Bruce Mitchell in his 1998 glossary of \"Beowulf.\"\n\nGrendel's mother has been adapted in a number of different media, including film, literature, and graphic novels.\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 21, 2002. In the episode, Homer Simpson is honored by the townspeople at a Friars' Club Roast, until it is interrupted by Kang and Kodos.\n\nThe episode was directed by Mark Kirkland and was written by Dan Castellaneta and his wife Deb Lacusta. The plot idea for the episode came about when \"The Simpsons\" cast members were on hiatus following a payment dispute. This is the fifth and, so far, the last clip show \"The Simpsons\" has produced. Instead, the series implements one \"trilogy episode\" each season. When it was first broadcast, \"Gump Roast\" received a 5.7 rating and was watched by 12.2 million viewers, making it the 16th most watched television show of the night. However, following its release on DVD and Blu-ray, the episode received negative reviews from critics.\n\nHomer Simpson sits on a park bench holding a box of chocolates, when Chief Wiggum appears to arrest him for impersonating a movie character. Homer tells Wiggum a story that he is not interested in at first, but becomes more intrigued when Homer uses flashbacks to help him tell the story. The Simpson family then arrives to take Homer to the Friars’ Club, where he is roasted by Krusty the Clown and other prominent citizens of Springfield. Among those roasting him are his son Bart, his daughter Lisa, and his boss Mr. Burns who tries to warn the people of Springfield of Homer's incompetence which, much to his dismay, they think is a joke. The roasters utilize more clips from previous episodes.\n\nSoon, Kang and Kodos arrive at the roast and declare that humans are stupid, as demonstrated by more clips. However, when they probe Homer's baby daughter Maggie's brain and see her memories through a monitor, the emotional impact is too much for them that they cry with joy, but angrily attempt to hide it by saying that they were vomiting from their eyes. However, Maggie's mind also reveals more clips, this time consisting of various celebrities. Kang and Kodos and the citizens make a deal, they agree to spare the Earth if everyone agrees to give them a place in the People's Choice Awards. They do, and Kang and Kodos enjoy the award ceremony. The episode ends with the song \"They’ll Never Stop the Simpsons\", which recounts additional past plots, possible future plots, and an apology for airing this clip show.\n\n\"Gump Roast\" was co-written by Dan Castellaneta and his wife Deb Lacusta, while Mark Kirkland served as director. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 21, 2002. The idea for the episode came about when Castellaneta and the other main \"Simpsons\" cast members were on hiatus while renegotiating their salaries. During the hiatus, Lacusta and Castellaneta were discussing the film \"Forrest Gump\" and questioned whether the stories Gump told actually happened, or if he made them up. They then compared the character to Homer, since they are both dimwitted and have \"fumbled into\" many different situations. Writing ensued, and when the cast members had settled the payment issue, Castellaneta and Lacusta presented the script to show runner Al Jean, who put the script into production.\n\nThe clip in which Homer skis down a mountain is one of the most used clips during events, according to Jean. One of the plot turns in the episode sees Kang and Kodos interrupting the roast. These characters normally only appear in Halloween episodes, however since \"Gump Roast\" is a clip show and therefore not in \"The Simpsons\" canon, Kang and Kodos were included in the episode. Since \"Gump Roast\", there has not been any more clip shows of \"The Simpsons\". Jean stated in the DVD commentary for the episode, that since the show now produces \"trilogy episodes\" (episodes that have three separate stories for each act) each season after season 13, making a clip show would be unnecessary.\n\nThe song \"They'll Never Stop The Simpsons\" playing at the end of the episode was written by \"Simpsons\" writer Matt Selman and sung by Castellaneta. It is a parody on the song “We Didn't Start the Fire” by Billy Joel, and was originally the same length as the song it was based on. However, because the episode was too long, the song had to be cut to its current length. In 2011, the song was re-recorded with alternative lyrics as a promotional video after \"The Simpsons\" was renewed for an additional 24th and 25th season. Castellaneta came in and recorded eight new takes, which was mixed together with some of the original vocals.\n\nThe opening scene, which shows Homer sitting on a bench holding a box of chocolates, is a reference to the movie \"Forrest Gump\". At one point Homer drunkenly quotes the film \"Secrets & Lies\". The act that Ned Flanders and Reverend Lovejoy are performing at the roast is an homage to the Smothers Brothers, who would later appear on \"The Simpsons\" in the episode “O Brother, Where Bart Thou?”. Moe dresses as Austin Powers from the comedy film series. Dr. Hibbert wears a costume of the character Darth Vader from the \"Star Wars\" series, and Mr. Burns approaches the podium to the sound of \"The Imperial March\", aka \"Darth Vader's Theme\". The song \"They'll Never Stop The Simpsons\" is a parody of Billy Joel's song \"We Didn't Start The Fire\".\n\nIn its original American broadcast on April 21, 2002, \"Gump Roast\" was watched by 12.2 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the 16th most watched television show of the night, as well as the highest-ranked show on the Fox network. It received, along with a new episode of \"Malcolm in the Middle\", a 5.7 rating among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49, meaning it was seen by 5.7% of the population in said demographic.\n\nFollowing the home video release of the thirteenth season of \"The Simpsons\", \"Gump Roast\" received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics. Both Ron Martin of 411Mania and Adam Rayner of Obsessed with Film wrote that the episode's premise is \"lazy\", and Rayner added that he felt \"cheated\". Andre Dellamorte of Collider was negative as well, writing that the episode “does a very poor job at justifying its existence\". The episode's plot was criticized by reviewers; Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict called the plot \"lackluster\" and added that it \"doesn't really make sense—and I mean that last part in a bad way!\" Nate Boss of Project-Blu held a similar view, stated that the plot \"made no sense\" and that the episode as a whole was \"complete lameness.\" James Greene of Nerve.com put the clip show third on his list \"Ten Times The Simpsons Jumped the Shark\", stating that \"You'd think by 2002 The Simpsons would've generated enough cash for FOX that they were no longer beholden to archaic penny-saving concepts like the clip show.\" Some reviewers considered the episode to be the worst of the season. However, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide stated that, even though he thought the episode was \"a cheap excuse for a new episode\", he found that it \"provokes more laughs than many of the other season 13 episodes since it quotes better programs from the past.\" Furthermore, the song at the end of the episode was well received by Malkowski, who described it as the best moment of the episode.\n\n"}

{"id": "16052633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16052633", "title": "Hyperpersonal model", "text": "Hyperpersonal model\n\nThe hyperpersonal model is a model of interpersonal communication that suggests computer-mediated communication (CMC) can become hyperpersonal because it \"exceeds [face-to-face] interaction\", thus affording message senders a host of communicative advantages over traditional face-to-face (FtF) interaction. Compared to ordinary FtF situations, a hyperpersonal message sender has a greater ability to strategically develop and edit self-presentation, enabling a selective and optimized presentation of one's self to others.\n\nCommunication professor Joseph Walther is credited with the development of this theory in 1996, after extensive research on computer-mediated communication.\n\nThe hyperpersonal model specifies conditions favorable to either interpersonal or impersonal interaction. The hyperpersonal model addresses three questions: 1) when is mediated interaction impersonal; 2) when is CMC interpersonal; and 3) when is CMC hyperpersonal? Hyperpersonal communication, according to Walther, is \"more socially desirable than we tend to experience in parallel FtF interaction\" (p. 17). Combinations of media attributes, social phenomena, and social-psychological processes may lead CMC to become \"hyperpersonal\", that is, to exceed face-to-face (FtF) communication. This perspective suggests that CMC users may experience greater levels of intimacy, unity and liking within a group or dyad than similar groups or dyads interacting FtF.\n\nThis component refers to \"selective self-presentation\". In CMC, message senders have a greater opportunity to optimize their self-presentation. Walther argues, \"[CMC participants] were better able to plan, and had increased opportunity to self-censor. With more time for message construction and less stress of ongoing interaction, users may have taken the opportunity to objective self-awareness, reflection, selection and transmission of preferable cues.\" Message senders use the process of selective self-presentation, which refers to CMC users' ability to manage their online image. Being able to self-censor and manipulate messages is possible to do within a CMC context to a greater extent than in FtF interactions, so individuals have greater control over what cues are sent. Walther points out that asynchronous messages and reduced communication cues contribute to selective self-presentation. In CMC, communicators may inflate attributions about their communication partners. When communication partners are geographically dispersed, individuals are likely to make positive attributions if group salience is high. As a result, members are more likely to make attributions of similarity that lead to greater liking for partners. Paralinguistic cues are used as part of assessing communication partners when using CMC. Selective self-presentation provides an avenue for people to manage their image in a manner that FtF interaction does not. Reduced communication cues and potentially asynchronous communication are both common in CMC.\n\n\"Reduced Cues\": CMC reduces cues present in normal FtF interactions. In CMC, first impressions aren't based on physical, and instead rely on information and personality. Senders impressions are more malleable than in an in-person interaction.\n\nWalther cites a study by Chilcoat and DeWine (1985) in which three interpersonal perceptions were examined (attractiveness, attitude similarity, and credibility) against three asynchronous communication vehicles (FtF, videoconferencing, and audioconferencing). One would expect FtF to produce higher ratings for the interpersonal characteristics, but the opposite was true: audioconferencing partners produced higher ratings of their partners' attractiveness, attitude similarity, and credibility than in videoconference or FtF interaction.\n\nThis component refers to \"idealization\". Walther argues that receivers have an \"idealized perception\" of the message sender in CMC. He says that the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE) predicts that subtle context cues take on a strong value in CMC. The absence of FtF cues leads to the fact that receivers may be very sensitive to any subtle social or personality cues that occur in CMC communication this way, CMC partners build impressions of one another on minimal cues. With fewer cues on which to base their perceptions, receivers have to \"fill in the gaps\" of their understanding of the other interactant and often assume more positive characteristics of them. In other words, without FtF cues to mediate the interaction, participants may assume their partner is a \"better person\" than they actually are.\n\nSince CMC doesn't require copresence the way FtF communication does, members can take part in activities at their own convenience, taking advantaged of disentrained communication channels. Walther cites a relaxation of time constraints in CMC, often allowing for an asynchronous mode of communication. For example, with group communication, \"...Making temporal commitments becomes discretionary. Group members may attend to the group process independently in time. When partners may attend their groups at their convenience, limitations on the amount of partners' mutual time available for meetings are less problematic.\"\n\nDisentrained channels—most often asynchronous communication, via email or forums—gives individuals a way to manage their relationships within groups more efficiently than via FtF. Using asynchronous communication, such as email, individuals are able to manage group relationships in a way that maximizes time spent on group tasks. Through the process of entrainment, people synchronize their activities to meet the requirements of the group's needs, which is constrained by each individuals time and attention. Entrainment can make it difficult for groups to complete tasks together since it requires FtF, and thus synchronous, communication, which may include off-topic discussions that hinder productivity. Asynchronous communication may mitigate entrainment associated with group interaction. According to Walther, asynchronous group interaction may not be constrained by time and/or competing commitments. Group members using asynchronous communication can devote their full attention to the group when they have the opportunity. Greater attention can be spent focusing on tasks related to the group rather than spending time and effort on communication that is irrelevant to the goal.\n\nAccording to Walther, CMC removes temporal limitations, thereby freeing time constraints. \"Both task-oriented and socially oriented exchanges may take place without one constraining the time available for the other.\n\nWalther argues that the \"behavioral confirmation\" - \"reciprocal influence that partners exert\" in sender-receiver roles — is magnified in minimal-cue interaction like CMC. In other words, in CMC communication, we behave based on the expectation of the other and the social data occurring in communication process is selectively sent and perceived by communicators. Feedback between sender and receiver is a critical part of the communication interaction for relationship development in either FtF or CMC relationships. However, feedback in a minimal-cue environment may be magnified. Behavioral confirmation is the process of communication partners developing impressions and intimacy as a result of interaction. In CMC, behavioral confirmation along with magnification can become idealized, leading CMC partners to develop greater affinity for CMC partners than he or she might develop in a FtF context. This kind of CMC interaction fosters the development of an intensification loop, explaining the hyperpersonal relationships that develop in a cues-limited environment.\n\nAs the last component of hyperpersonal model, it is conceptualized as reciprocal interaction with others that strengthens one’s online performance by bringing together the identity transforming potentials embedded within the other theoretical components.\n\nIn face-to-face communication, physical features such as appearance, facial expressions, gesture and postures is exposed to others, which can help to convey nonverbal information to help with the communication. Face-to-face communication is formed naturally in emotional, cognitive and physical aspects. Those nonverbal languages are the cues that lack in CMC communication.\n\nSome argue that the lack of nonverbal cues in CMC may decrease one's capability of fostering and managing accurate impression on others. Additionally, the lack of nonverbal cues leads to the fact that CMC communication involves less emotional elements than FtF communication does, which contributes to less richness and interpersonal and expressive cues that may provide more positive impression.\n\nWhile other holds the opposite opinions. Walther suggested in his research in 1996 that CMC can actually improve the interpersonal bond between senders and receivers because of the lack of nonverbal cues and demographic messages. Walther argued that nonverbal and demographic cues that occur in FtF communication play a distracting role; while in CMC communication, hyperpersonal interaction is created in which senders pay more attention on the strategy of delivering message so that the self-presentation is enhanced and optimized, which eventually improve the interpersonal interaction.\n\nWalther developed an alternate approach to the cues-filtered-out approach. From the social information-processing (SIP) viewpoint, Walther states that people naturally want to develop social relationships. With SIP, the idea of the rate at which social information is exchanged is introduced. Additionally, SIP looks at verbal strategies used in mediated communication. Individuals strategically use language to convey a myriad of information about the sender, enabling the receiver to make attributes about the sender. Yet if CMC really was impersonal, why were so many people adopting CMC for social purposes, such as online gaming, bulletin boards and online chat groups? Walther advanced a different model to explain the growing trend toward the use of CMC for social interaction. When media attributes, social phenomena and social-psychological processes are integrated, the result is what Walther called \"hyperpersonal.\"\n\nAccording to Walther's research(1996), the study of CMC went through three phases: from impersonal, to interpersonal, and finally to hyperpersonal. First, because CMC shows no nonverbal cues, some argued that CMC was more task-oriented than was FtF. The reasons are:\n\nEarly CMC group research suggested that CMC groups were better for task-oriented interactions than their FtF counterparts. In task-oriented situations, where overly personal interpersonal interaction is not desired, then impersonal interaction is the appropriate kind of interaction, because the communication exchanges are more focused on the group's task. For example, a geographically dispersed technology team tasked with solving a software application bug may be more productive when the communication is task focused rather than interpersonal in nature. This doesn't mean that all CMC is impersonal, but points out that specific contexts may be better suited for impersonal interaction rather than personal exchanges.\n\nThen, Walther stated that CMC is not always impersonal; instead, it can also develop social relationships. Although there is less social information exchange in CMC because of the absence of nonverbal cues, as the communication time increases, the exchange of social information is increasing accordingly. And the anticipation of future communication may make communicators to look for more information about the other. This mechanism leads to similar immediacy, similarity, composure, and receptivity as in FtF communication. However, there is a shortcoming. Since it takes time for CMC to achieve consensus, if the time for CMC is limited, the information exchanged will be much less than do FtF, which may impact the efficiency of group work.\n\nFinally, Walther brought up the concept of hyperpersonal communication, which demonstrates that \"CMC that is more socially desirable than we tend to experience in parallel FtF interaction.\" Walther proposes that CMC users do take part in hyperpersonal communication. Senders and receivers engage in the process of selective-self presentation through the message they create and send. This can lead to the idealization of the sender by the receiver based on making attributions from available paralingual cues found in the message. This process is enhanced with asynchronous exchanges, letting both sender and receiver have ample time to consider the messages sent and received. Hyperpersonal interaction would be excessively or above normal personal interaction. In other words, online relationships can develop into hyperpersonal that is excessively personal. When users experience commonality and are self-aware, physically separated, and communicating via a limited-cues channel, they can selectively self-present and edit their communication, enabling them to construct and reciprocate representations of their partners and relations without the interference of environmental reality. Hyperpersonal communication can thus be defined as computer-mediated interaction that is more attractive than experiences in similar FtF exchanges. The hyperpersonal model can be understood by looking at the established communication processes that include sender, receiver, channel, and feedback. The sender uses the process of selective self-presentation; this refers to CMC users' ability to manage their online image. Being able to self-censor and manipulate messages is possible to do within a CMC context to a greater extent than in FtF interactions, so individuals have greater control over what cues are sent.\n\nHe made this argument in four aspects of the communication process: receivers, senders, characteristics of the channel, and feedback processes.\n\nThere are results showing that under CMC, relational intimacy increased faster than FtF. One of the logics behind this finding is that hyperpersonal model is determining the inflated nature of feedback in CMC.Online communication behaviors have the possibility to exaggerate the influence on self-expression or self-presentations and following internalization. The theoretical assumption of the inflated interpersonal feedback in CMC pointed out in the hyperpersonal model by Walther is advanced by this research. Hyperpersonal model can be deemed as the theoretical framework for the research on exaggerated social process in CMC mainly from the following perspectives: 1)selective presentation, 2)Impression management, 3)Impression management in CMC, 4) idealized interpretation, 5)interpersonal feedback loop, 6)Identity shift, and 7) influence of feedback on identity shift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoyce Lamerichs and Hedwig F. M. Te Molder from the department of communication science at Wageningen University and Research Centre evaluate the ways in which computer-mediated communication (CMC) has thus far been conceptualized, proposing an alternative approach. They argue that traditional perspectives ignore participants' everyday understanding of media use and media characteristics by relying on an individualistic and cognitive framework. The social identity model of deindividuation effects model totally disregards identity construction in daily communication activities like talk, text & email. In order to understand this they tried to re study online interaction and specifically studied an online forum on depression. It is shown that participants' identities do not so much mirror their inner worlds but are discourse practices in their own right.\n\nIn another study by Sonja Utz titled \"Social information processing in MUDS: The development of friendships in virtual worlds\" conducted a study that actually examines friendships in the virtual world. This study revealed a high level of skepticism in participants when it came to CMC. This theory used the social information processing theory.\n\nSIDE model is a recent development of deindividuation theory, refers to social identity/deindividuation model. It demonstrates that it is that the property of group identity increases, rather other that individual identity loses, that leading to the occurring changes of CMC users. SIDE model predicts that in CMC, the sense of self diminishes, while the sense of group increases. SIDE model is distinguished from classical deindividuation theory which put its focus on the sense of self rather than the sense of group identity.\n\nIn the work titled 'The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life' (1959), Goffman demonstrated that in FtF communication, people use verbal and nonverbal languages to present appropriately and favorably to others since they care about the image or impression they leave for others and others' perception towards them. This phenomenon is called impression management. While in text-based CMC, the modification of impression is limited to \"language, typographic, and chronemic information.\"\n\nDeindividuation is a social psychology theory being generally thought as the loss of self-awareness in groups, though this is a matter of contention.\n\nInterpersonal communication is a process of information exchange between two or more people. This research generally contributes to six categories of inquiry: 1) how humans adapt their verbal communication and nonverbal communication during face-to-face communication, 2) the message production processes. 3) how uncertainty influences our behavior and information-management strategies, 4) deceptive communication, 5) relational dialectics, and 6) social interaction that is mediated by technology.\n\nMedia richness theory, also sometimes referred to as information richness theory/MRT, is introduced by Richard L. Daft and Robert H. Lengel in 1986 as an extension of information processing theory. It is a framework aiming to describe a communication medium's ability in reproducing the information sent over it.\n\nNonverbal communication is communication process sending and receiving information in the form of wordless cues.\n\nPoliteness theory explains the redressing of affronts by face-threatening acts to a person's \"face\". This concept of face is originally generated from Chinese and then into English in the 19th century.\n\nAlso known as SIP, Social information processing theory is an interpersonal communication theory and media studies developed by Joseph Walther in 1992. It accounts for online interpersonal communication without nonverbal cues and in a computer-mediated environment, how people develop and manage their relationships.\n\n"}

With a successful format identified, further \"... for Beginners\" titles soon began to appear. The line's most enduring titles, all published during this period, were \"Marx for Beginners\" (1976), \"Freud for Beginners\" (1979), \"Einstein for Beginners\" (1979), and \"Darwin for Beginners\" (1982). In the early 1980s schism arose over questions of control after some members of the cooperative sold U.S. rights to part of the \"For Beginners\" series to Pantheon Books and the Cooperative officially disbanded in 1984. \n\nIn 1992, Richard Appignanesi, who had been the first editor in London for the series and had also written several of the titles, co-created the new London-based publisher Icon Books, under whose imprint he republished several of the \"For Beginner\" titles and continued to publish and expand a new version of the series. Meanwhile, Glenn Thompson, who, since 1987, had continued the \"For Beginners\" through his New York-based Writers and Readers Publishing, Inc., also established the London-based Writers and Readers Limited in 1992, to protect his own continuation of the series. These two publishers continued their series in several cases commissioning new authors to create alternate books to those being published by the other, leading to a number of examples where the two series were publishing two different books under the same title. The situation was eventually resolved in 1999 by the Icon series being rebranded as the \"Introducing...\" series, with titles starting with that word instead of ending \"For Beginners\".\n\nBeginning in 2008, Icon's new titles and reissues played down the \"Introducing...\" to the level of a series name, and the titles were instead prominently subtitled \"A Graphic Guide.\" In 2011, a second \"Introducing...\" series was launched with the subtitle \"Practical Guides\" focusing on topics within business, psychology and counselling.\n\nScience writer Brian Clegg, author of \"Introducing Infinity\" (2012) in the series, states that, \"It is almost impossible to rate these relentlessly hip books - they are pure marmite,\" as the series, \"puts across the message in a style that owes as much to Terry Gilliam and pop art as it does to popular science.\"\n\nThe following \"Graphic Guides\" titles have been published or republished by Icon Books since 1992.\n\nThe following \"Practical Guides\" titles have been published by Icon Books since 2011.\n\n\n"}

He gained fame for his bravery on the battlefield, becoming the youngest noncommissioned officer in Army history. He retired from the U.S. Army in 1915, having attained the rank of brigadier general in the Quartermaster Corps; he was the last veteran of the American Civil War still on duty in the U.S. Armed Forces. By special act of Congress on August 29, 1916, he was promoted to major general one year after his retirement.\n\nBorn with the surname \"Klem\" in Newark, Ohio on August 13, 1851, he is said to have run away from home at age 10 in May 1861, after the death of his mother in a train accident, to become a Union Army drummer boy. First he attempted to enlist in the 3rd Ohio Infantry, but was rejected because of his age and small size. He then tried to join the 22nd Michigan, which also refused him. He tagged along anyway and the 22nd eventually adopted him as mascot and drummer boy. Officers chipped in to pay him the regular soldier's wage of $13 a month and allowed him to officially enlist two years later. Research has shown that Clem's claims about the 3rd Ohio and running away from home in 1861 (rather than in either 1862 or 1863) may be fictitious.\n\nA popular legend suggests that Clem served as a drummer boy with the 22nd Michigan at the Battle of Shiloh. The legend suggests that he came very near to losing his life when a fragment from a shrapnel shell crashed through his drum, knocking him unconscious, and that subsequently his comrades who found and rescued him from the battlefield nicknamed Clem \"Johnny Shiloh.\" The weight of historical evidence however suggests that Clem could not have taken part in the battle of Shiloh. The 22nd Michigan appears to be the first unit in which Clem served in any capacity, but this regiment had not yet been constituted at the time of the battle (mustering into service in August 1862 – four months after the Battle of Shiloh). The Johnny Shiloh legend appears instead to stem from a popular Civil War song, \"The Drummer Boy of Shiloh\" by William S. Hays which was written for \"Harpers Weekly\" of New York. The song was written following the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863, and may have been written with Clem in mind because he had already become a nationally-known figure by that time.\n\nRegardless of his entry into service, Clem served as a drummer boy for the 22nd Michigan at the Battle of Chickamauga. He is said to have ridden an artillery caisson to the front and wielded a musket trimmed to his size. In the course of a Union retreat, he shot a Confederate colonel who had demanded his surrender. After the battle, the \"Drummer Boy of Chickamauga\" was promoted to sergeant, the youngest soldier ever to be a noncommissioned officer in the United States Army. Secretary of the Treasury, later Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and fellow Ohioan, Salmon P. Chase, decorated him for his heroics at Chickamauga. Clem's fame for the shooting is also open for debate, despite press reports supporting the story into the early 20th century. It is possible that he wounded Col. Calvin Walker, whose 3rd Tennessee opposed the 22nd Michigan towards the end of the battle.\nIn October 1863, Clem was captured in Georgia by Confederate cavalrymen while detailed as a train guard. The Confederates confiscated his U.S. uniform which reportedly upset him terribly—including his cap which had three bullet holes in it. He was included in a prisoner exchange a short time later, but the Confederate newspapers used his age and celebrity status for propaganda purposes, to show \"what sore straits the Yankees are driven, when they have to send their babies out to fight us.\" After participating with the Army of the Cumberland in many other battles, serving as a mounted orderly, he was discharged in September 1864. Clem was wounded in combat twice during the war.\n\nClem graduated from high school in 1870. In 1871, he was elected commander/captain of the \"Washington Rifles\" a District of Columbia Army National Guard militia unit. After he attempted unsuccessfully to enter the United States Military Academy, after failing the entrance exam, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him second lieutenant in the Twenty Fourth United States Infantry in December 1871. Clem was promoted to first lieutenant in 1874. Clem graduated from artillery school at Fort Monroe in 1875. He was promoted to captain in 1882 and transferred to the Quartermaster Department where he stayed for the rest of his career. He was promoted to major in 1895.\n\nDuring the Spanish–American War in 1898 he served as depot quartermaster in Portland, Oregon as well as department quartermaster for the Department of Columbia. He then served in the occupation of Puerto Rico as depot and chief quartermaster in San Juan.\n\nClem was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1901 and to colonel in 1903. He then served from 1906 to 1911 as chief quartermaster at Fort Sam Houston in Texas.\nClem reached the mandatory retirement age of 64 on August 13, 1915, when he was retired and promoted to the rank of brigadier general, as was customary for American Civil War veterans who retired at the rank of colonel. Clem was the last veteran of the American Civil War serving in the U.S. Army at the time of his retirement, though another Civil War veteran, Peter Conover Hains, re-entered the service in 1917. On August 29, 1916, Clem was promoted on the retired list to the rank of major general.\n\nHe married Anita Rosetta French in 1875. After her death in 1899, he married Bessie Sullivan of San Antonio in 1903. Sullivan was the daughter of a Confederate veteran, leading Clem to claim that he was \"the most united American\" alive. Clem was the father of three children. Clem was a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the Military Order of Foreign Wars.\n\nAfter retirement he lived in Washington, D.C. before returning to San Antonio, Texas. He died in San Antonio on May 13, 1937, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia.\n\nThrough his military career Clem held the following ranks:\n\n\n\n\nIn 1963, Walt Disney produced a made-for-TV film entitled \"Johnny Shiloh\", with Kevin Corcoran in the title role. The film was telecast on the Disney anthology television series. The Sherman Brothers wrote the film's theme song; their 1968 movie musical score for \"The One and Only Genuine Original Family Band\" also included a song about him called \"Drummin', Drummin', Drummin',\" performed in the film by Walter Brennan who played an ex-Confederate soldier.\n\nIn 2007 Historical Productions released the movie Johnny \"The True Story of a Civil War Legend\" starring Cody Piper in the role of Johnny Lincoln (Shiloh) Clem. The movie is filmed in a documentary narrative way with many U.S. Civil War reenactments. The movie is filled with information about what life was like as a Union soldier. By using actual photos, the viewer gains an understanding of the hardships caused by the Civil War.\n\n\n9. Chickamauga \n10. \n\n"}

She is an academic and writer whose work focuses on black studies, cultural geography, anti-colonial and diaspora studies, with an emphasis on the ways in which social justice emerges in black creative texts (music, fiction, poetry, visual art). While many scholars have researched the areas of North American, European, Caribbean, and African black geographies, McKittrick was the first scholar to put forth the interdisciplinary possibilities of black and black feminist geography, with an emphasis on embodied, creative and intellectual spaces engendered in the diaspora.\n\nMcKittrick has a Ph.D. in Women’s Studies from York University; she received her degree in 2004.\n\nSince 2005, she has been Professor in Gender Studies at Queen’s University, with joint appointments in Cultural Studies and Geography. She is currently Editor at \"Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography\".\n\nMcKittrick’s work has focused on black feminist thought and cultural geography, as explored in her book \"Demonic Grounds: Black Women and the Cartographies of Struggle (2006).\" The book has been reviewed in \"Gender, Place & Culture,\"\" Southscapes: Geographies of Race, Religion, & Literature,\" \"Topia: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies\" and \"American Literature.\"\nThe book was followed by \"Black Geographies and the Politics of Place\" (2007), which she co-edited with Clyde Woods. The book has been reviewed in \"Canadian Woman Studies.\" \nMcKittrick’s research draws on the areas of black studies, anti-colonial studies, cultural geographies, and gender studies, and attends to the links between epistemological narratives and social justice.

NourbeSe Philip, Willie Bester, Nas, Octavia Butler, Jimi Hendrix, Dionne Brand and Michael Jackson.\n\nMcKittrick's 2014 article, \"Mathematics Black Life\" argues that since the presence of blackness in the colonial archive is conditioned by slavery, black death and anti-black violence, subsequent scholarly analyses of these histories often \"repeat and cherish anti-black violence and black death.\" McKittrick argues further, \"If the source of blackness is death and violence, the citation of blackness—the scholarly stories we tell—calls for the repetition of death and violence. The practice of taking away life is followed by the sourcing and citation of racial-sexual death and racial-sexual violence and blackness is (always already and only) cast inside the mathematics of unlivingness (data/scientifically proven/certified violation/asterisk) where black comes to be (a bit).\" According to McKittrick, to be committed to a decolonial logic that undoes and resists anti-black violence rather than reproduces it, black studies scholars must read the archive differently. This alternate reading aims to uncover instances of black freedom within the transatlantic archive as inherent to the mathematics of anti-black violence, or \"as possibilities that are iterations of black life that cannot be contained by black death.\" McKittrick offers an example of this kind of alternative citational practice throughout the essay, as she persistently emphasizes and returns to the plight of an unnamed, formerly enslaved woman who, as recorded in \"The Book of Negroes\", claims she was \"born free at Newtown, Long Island.\" For McKittrick, this ex-slave's claim to freedom offers an opportunity for scholars to \"trust the lies\" that exist in the archive of slavery in order to locate and dwell on instances of black freedom.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "900332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=900332", "title": "Krste Misirkov", "text": "Krste Misirkov\n\nKrste Petkov Misirkov (; ) (18 November 1874, Postol, Ottoman Empire – 26 July 1926, Sofia, Kingdom of Bulgaria) was a philologist, slavist, historian and ethnographer. In the period between 1903 and 1907 he published a book and a scientific magazine in which he affirmed the existence of a Macedonian national identity separate from other Balkan nations, and attempted to codify a Standard Macedonian language based on the central Western Macedonian dialects. A survey conducted in the Republic of Macedonia found Misirkov to be \"the most significant Macedonian of the 20th century\". For his efforts to codify a standard Macedonian language, he is often considered \"the founder of the modern Macedonian literary language\".\n\nHowever, in 1907 he began publishing predominantly articles, written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective. Misirkov reverted to Macedonian nationalism for a short in 1919. During the 1920s his views changed again, and he encouraged the Macedonian Slavs to adopt a Bulgarian national identity. Because Misirkov expressed conflicting views about the national identity of the Macedonians Slavs at different points in his life, his national affiliation and legacy remains a matter of dispute between Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia.\n\nWhile Misirkov's work and personality remain highly controversial and disputed, there have been attempts among international scholars to reconcile the conflicting and self-contradictory statements made by Misirkov. According to Croatian Ivo Banac, professor of history at Yale University Misirkov viewed both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians, and espoused pan-Bulgarian patriotism in a larger Balkan context, and especially with regard to Serbian and Greek hegemonism in Macedonia. However, in the context of the larger Bulgarian unit/nation, Misirkov sought both cultural and national differentiation from the Bulgarians and called both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia Macedonians.\n\nKrste Petkov Misirkov was born on 18 November 1874 in the village of Postol in the Salonica Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (present-day Greece). He started his elementary education in the local Greek school, where he was studying until the sixth grade elementary school, but the bad financial situation of his family could not support his further education at that point and he left the school. At that period Serbian propaganda began to promote its variant of \"Macedonism\" and to recruit young people in order to \"Serbianize\" them. After some period, Misirkov applied and was granted a scholarship by the Serbian association \"St. Sava\".\n\nMisirkov spent some time in Serbia, where he was studying in Serbian, and soon after he realized that the propaganda was the main goal of the Serbian association. The politics practiced by the association forced Misirkov and the other Macedonian students to participate in a student's revolt against the Saint Sava society. As a result of that, Misirkov and other companions moved from Belgrade to Sofia. Since he faced up with similar situation in Bulgaria, i.e., another propaganda, Misirkov again went to Serbia to continue his education, but without any success because he was rejected by the \"St. Sava\" association. Since he was willing to get higher education, he was forced, by a chain of events, to enroll a theological school for teachers. Similar to the association \"St. Sava\", this school as well had its own propagandistic goals and that resulted in another revolt of the students. As a result of it, the school stopped working and the students were sent throughout Serbia. Misirkov was sent to Šabac, where he finished the last, fourth, class of secondary education, but this time in the local gymnasium. In both, Serbia and Bulgaria, Misirkov and his friend were treated as Serbs or Bulgarians in order to be accepted in the educational system. After the gymnasium, even though he graduated, Misirkov enrolled in another secondary school for teachers in Belgrade, where he graduated in 1895. During this time, particularly in 1893, Misirkov founded an association of students called \"Vardar\". Its charter included, among other things, the aim of studying and spreading a knowledge of their country as regards its geographical, ethnographic and historical aspects and the cardinal principle of its program was that Macedonia should belong to the Macedonians. In other words, the students were not satisfied by the Serbianization of the Macedonians. This idea was inspired by the \"Lozari\". However, the Serbs were opposed to this thesis of the young students, so their society did not last very long and it was disbanded in 1895. Afterwards he was appointed as a Serbian teacher in Pristina. Misirkov refused and left for Odessa to continue his studies.\n\nHis educational qualifications obtained in Belgrade were not recognized in Russia. Misirkov had to study from the very beginning in the Seminary at Poltava. In 1897 he was able to enter the Petersburg University. Here he entered at first the Bulgarian Students Association. About that part of his life, Misirkov writes in the article \"School and socialism\" - \"In 1897 I went to Petrograd University and for five years was among the Bulgarian studentship as Bulgarian and member of the Bulgarian Student Society\". Misirkov carried out here his first scholarly lecture on the ethnography and history of the Balkan Peninsula before the members of the Russian Imperial Geographical Society.\n\nOn November 15, 1900, when Misirkov third year student in the Faculty of History and Philosophy, along with other students in Russia created а Petersburg circle. The main objective of the circle is political autonomy of the population of Macedonia and Thrace, declared by IMARO implemented and guaranteed by the Great Powers. In a letter sent to the President of the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee on November 28, circle founders state that \" there's no Bulgarian who is not interested in the situation and fate of that part of our homeland, which continue to groan under the yoke of the tyrant\". At that time Misirkov still considers the Slavic population of Macedonia and Thrace as Bulgarian.\n\nIn 1901, he moved to the University of Odessa. Of great importance to Misirkov was the founding of the Macedonian Scientific and Literary Society in Petersburg. Its creation was influenced by the Macedonian Club founded in Belgrade. After the Club was closed, its chief founders left for the Russian capital, where they organized the new Macedonian Society. This foundation in 1902 became the most important Macedonian institution abroad. In the same year this Society sent a special Memorandum to the Great Powers, in which the Macedonian Question was examined from the national point of view. It was proposed also Macedonian literary language to be codified. The question was also examined of establishing a Macedonian Church under the Ohrid Archbishopric. The aim of this Memorandum was that the Macedonians should be recognized as a separate nation and that Macedonia should be granted full autonomy within the Ottoman Empire. During this time he also examined the medieval period in Macedonia and his works contributed to the understanding of the 14th-century local ruler Krali Marko.\n\nLater Misirkov abandoned the University and left for Ottoman Macedonia.\n\nFacing financial obstacles to continue his postgraduate education, he accepted the proposal of the Bulgarian Exarchate to be appointed teacher in a high school in Bitola. There he became friendly with the Russian consul in Bitola. He began to plan opening of local schools and publishing textbooks in Macedonian language. But the Ilinden Uprising in 1903 and the assassination of the Russian Consul changed his plans and he returned to Russia. There Misirkov published different articles about the Ilinden Uprising and the reasons why the Consul was assassinated. Soon afterwards he wrote the brochure \"The Macedonian matters\" and published it in Sofia. This book, was written in the Central Macedonian dialect, and Misirkov attacked in his writings the Bulgarian Exarchate, the Ilinden Uprising and the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) as Bulgarian creations. As result, he was persecuted by IMARO, and it is believed its members destroyed a lot of copies of his book. However, he says that Dame Gruev, Gotse Delchev, Boris Sarafov and other IMRO members are Macedonian national separatists.\n\nIn 1905 he left for Berdiansk in Southern Russia. There he resumed publication of the journal \"Vardar\" and worked as Bulgarian teacher. In many of his next articles after 1905 Misirkov exposed pro-Bulgarian views and even categorically renounced the point of his book \"The Macedonian matters\". On 18 April 1907 Misirkov began to cooperate with the issued in Sofia magazine \"Macedonian-Adrianople Review\", edited by Nikola Naumov, which was \"de facto\" organ of the IMARO. On 24 April 1909 K. Missirkov printed in Odessa in a separate booklet his work \"South Slavic epic legends of the marriage of King Volkashin in connection with the question of the reasons for the popularity of Krali Marko among the South Slavs\". On 1 October 1909 he printed the article, \"The foundations of a Serbian-Bulgarian rapprochement\" in the Magazine \"Bulgarian collection\" edited by Bulgarian diplomats in St. Petersburg. By the time, a Slavic Festival was held in Sofia in 1910 and Missirkov was attend as its guest of honor. In 1910–1911, he translated from Bulgarian to Russian the book of the Bulgarian geographer Prof. Atanas Ishirkov \"Bulgaria\".\n\nWhen the First Balkan war was declared, Misirkov went to Macedonia as a Russian war correspondent. There he could follow the military operations of the Bulgarian Army. Misirkov published a series of articles in the Russian press and some articles demanding that the Ottomans should be driven out of Macedonia. In 1913 after the outbreak of the Second Balkan war Misirkov went back to Russia, where he worked as a teacher also in the Bulgarian schools in Odessa. Here he wrote his diary, which was found in 2006. Later he was appointed teacher of the Bulgarian school at Kishinev. While working as a teacher in Kishinev, Misirkov sent а letter to the Bulgarian academic Aleksandar Teodorov-Balan with a request to be assigned as a professor at Sofia University. That request clearly indicates his self-identification at that time - \"As a Bulgarian, I would willingly return to Bulgaria, if there is a need of a scientific research of the fate of the Bulgarian lands, especially Macedonia.\". A shorter letter with similar content was sent to another professor at Sofia University - Vasil Zlatarski with the request to be assigned as a chosen \"at the newly established department for history of Macedonia and the other western Bulgarian lands\".\n\nAt that point, Misirkov made contacts with the Macedonian Scientific and Literary Society, which started publishing the magazine \"Macedonian Voice\" in Russian. Misirkov was publishing in this magazine for some period under the pseudonym \"K. Pelski\".\n\nAfter the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Bessarabia became a democratic republic, and he was elected a member of the local parliament Sfatul Ţării as a representative of the Bulgarian minority. At the same time, Misirkov worked as a secretary in the Bulgarian educational commission in Bessarabia. In March 1918 was declared the union of Bessarabia with Romania. On May 21, 1918 Misirkov openеd a Bulgarian language course in Bolhrad. Then he took a secret trip to Bulgaria in order to procure textbooks for the students, but after his return in November he was arrested by the Kingdom of Romania authorities, still at war with Bulgaria; afterwards, he was extradited to Bulgaria.\n\nЕxpelled by the Romanian authorities, at the end of 1918 Misirkov returned to Sofia, where he spent one year as a head of the Historical department of the National Museum of Ethnography. Then, he worked as a teacher and director of the high schools in Karlovo and Koprivshtitsa. During this period (but before 1923) the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) apparently marked Misirkov as harmful to its cause and supposedly considering his assassination, but reconsidered after he met with a representative of the organization. He also resumed his journalistic activity and published many articles on the Macedonian Question in the Bulgarian press. Misirkov died in 1926 and was buried in the graveyards in Sofia with the financial support of 5000 levs from the Ministry of Education, as an honoured educator.\n\nIn his life, Misirkov wrote one book, one diary, published one issue of a magazine and wrote more than thirty articles. His book \"On Macedonian Matters\" was published in Sofia in 1903. The magazine was called \"Vardar\" and was published in 1905 in Odessa, Russian Empire. The articles that Misirkov wrote have been published in different newspapers and they were focused on different topics. The book, magazine and a number of his article were written in the Central Macedonian dialects, which are basis of the Modern Macedonian.\n\nOne of the most important work of Misirkov is the Macedonian book \" \" (За македонцките работи, \"Za makedonckite raboti\") published in 1903 in Sofia, in which he laid down the principles of the modern Macedonian language. This book was written in a Macedonian dialects from the area between Prilep and Bitola. It argued in favor of national separation, the establishment of autonomous national institutions within the Ottoman empire, and the standardization of a distinct Macedonian language. Misirkov attacked both the Bulgarian Exarchate and the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) as agents of the Bulgarian interests in Macedonia.\n\nAccording to this book, the Macedonian literary language should be based on dialects from the central part of Macedonia, which were used in the book itself. On the other hand, Misirkov appealed to the Ottoman authorities for eventual recognition of a separate Macedonian nation. He admitted there was not such one, and most of the Macedonian Slavs has called themselves Bulgarians, but it should be created, when the necessary historical circumstances would arise.\n\nAs a consequence, Misirkov was persecuted and went back to Russia. Most copies of his book were confiscated or destroyed by the Bulgarian police and IMARO-activists, shortly after the book was published. Because of that at his own time, the book had little or no impact and did not become popular until the middle of the 1940s. Then it was rediscovered by the Macedonian linguist Blaze Koneski in Sofia, and its content was popularized.\n\nAccording some researchers Misirkov's principles played a crucial role in the future codification of the Macedonian language, right after World War II, while others like Loring Danforth and John Shea consider that \"the language planners involved in the codification of standard literary Macedonian in 1944, were working in complete ignorance of Misirkov's work\". John Shea alone states that Misirkov's book was lost and the process of standardization of the Macedonian language had to start all over again in 1944, as well as that \"Misirkov's book was actually written Macedonian Standard language which was finally codified in 1944/1945.\"\n\nAfter the Second World War Misirkovs book will be permanently cited by the historians in Macedonia as an indication of the existence of a separate Macedonian ethnicity at his time. However, only two years later Misirkov changed his stance, and published a series of articles in the IMARO press written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective, claiming Bulgarian identity for himself and the Macedonian Slavs.\n\nBesides \"On Macedonian Matters\", Misirkov is author of the first scientific magazine on Macedonian language. The was published in 1905 in Odessa, Russian Empire. The magazine was published only once, because of the financial problems that Misirkov had been facing with at that time. \"Vardar\" has been published on Macedonian language, and the orthography that has been used is almost same as the orthography of the standard Macedonian language.\n\nThe magazine was meant to include several different scientific disciplines, mostly concerned with Macedonia. The first section of the magazine is made of the introduction, where in general Misirkov elaborates the aims of the magazine and this section was in Macedonian and Russian. The next section of the magazine is the literary section, where Misirkov translated into Macedonian the poem \"Traveler\" by the Croatian poet P. Preradovic. After the literary section, the magazine includes an analysis about the Balkan propagandas in Macedonia, followed by a political analysis of some of the global events in that period. The last section is statistics, which shows the Macedonian population in Macedonia.\n\nThe goals of the magazine were to:\n\nRegarding the opponents of the magazine, Misirkov shares his concern that \"at the end, the larger, if not to say the largest, part of the Macedonian intelligentsia would be against \"Vardar\" and its program, because all Macedonian, opponents of the Macedonian national separatism, are convinced, that with money in Macedonia a man can create out of our Macedonians not only Bulgarian, Serb, Greek or Macedonian, but even Gypsy nationality\". He also believes that the \"common people will (also) be against Vardar and his associates, the national separatists, because the idea of the separatists, is hard to be understood by the common people, which is faced up with different kinds of prechments and new ideas'.\n\nDuring his life, Misirkov published many articles for different newspapers and magazines. The articles deal with Macedonia, Macedonian culture, ethnology, politics and nation on one hand and with the Bulgarian nation, politics and ethnography on the other. Misirkov published his articles in Macedonian, Russian and Bulgarian and he published them either in Russia or in Bulgaria. Most of the articles were signed by his birth name, but there are articles that are signed with his pseudonym \"K. Pelski\".\n\nIn 2006, a handwritten diary by Misirkov written during his stay in Russia in 1913 was discovered. It was declared authentic by Bulgarian and Macedonian experts and was published in 2008. The content of the diary clearly shows that at the time, Misirkov was a Bulgarian nationalist. It has given rise to new public discussion over Misirkov's stances on Bulgarian and Macedonian ethnicity. The manuscript, includes 381 pages written in Russian language. Misirkov wrote it in Kotovsk's nearby village of Klimentove, where he lived and worked at the time. It contains also articles and excerpts from the Russian press of that time.\n\nIn several publications Misirkov made an attempt to determine the border between the Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian language, including in the Bulgarian dialect area nearly all of Torlakian and Macedonian dialects. Misirkov pointed there, that the population in Pomoravlje is autochthonous and Bulgarian by origin, excluding any later migrations during the Ottoman rule from Bulgaria.\nAccording to Krste Misirkov, Krali Marko epic songs in Serbia, the so-called \"Bugarstici\" are a result from Bulgarian musical influence over the Serbian folk music.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century the idea of a separate Macedonian ethnicity was as yet promoted only by some circles of intellectuals. Then, most of the Slavic people in Macedonia considered themselves Bulgarian, and Macedonist idea failed to gain wide popular support. At different points in his life, Misirkov expressed conflicting statements about the ethnicity of the Slavs living in Macedonia, including his own ethnicity. \n\nIn Bulgaria, Misirkov is regarded as a controversial educator with scientific contribution to Bulgarian dialectology and ethnography. He graduated from the Belgrade University as a student of Prof. Stojan Novaković and was influenced by his ideas. At that time, Novaković was a prominent proponent of the Macedonism, thereby promoting Serbian interests in the region of Macedonia. Afterwards Misirkov met several times with him and Novaković's diplomatic activity in St. Petersburg played significant role for the foundation of the Macedonian Scientific and Literary Society. However, after 1906 Misirkov rejected these ideas, opposng the Serbian theory about the \"floating mass\" of the \"Macedonian Slavs\" and even developed a kind of \"Serbophobia\". In this period he became evidently bulgarophile and argued that the Slavic population of Macedonia was not \"a formless paste\" but a \"well baked Bulgarian bread\", even though in his book and part of his articles writes about the existence of a separate Macedonian nation. Later in 1913, in his diary from the Balkan wars, he explicitly identifies himself as Macedonian Bulgarian. Bulgarian historians believe that his writings were significantly altered by the post-WWII Yugoslavian Communist regime to support the notion of a \"Macedonian nation\", distinct from the Bulgarian one. Bulgarians also note that Misirkov worked as a Bulgarian teacher in Russia, was Bulgarian deputy in Bessarabia, chose Bulgarian citizenship, lived and died in Bulgaria and worked there until his death in 1926. Nevertheless, Bulgarian scholarship points out that despite Misirkov in many cases defending the cause of Bulgarian nationalism, he several times switched during the 1920s, from Bulgarian to Macedonian one, and vice a versa. According to Bulgarian observers, after the breakup of Yugoslavia in the Republic of Macedonia also have arisen polemics about the identity of Misirkov. The most popular Misirkov's thought in Bulgaria is:\nIn the Republic of Macedonia, Misirkov is regarded as the most prominent Macedonian publicist, philologist and linguist who set the principles of the Macedonian literary language in the early 20th century. In some of his writings he identifies the Macedonians as separate nation and the Macedonian as a separate South Slavic language. Also, Misirkov is the author of the first scientific magazine in Macedonian and because of his contributions to the Macedonian national cause, he is regarded as the greatest Macedonian of the 20th century. In his honor, many books and scientific works have been published and the Institute for Macedonian language \"Krste Misirkov\" is named after him.\n\nThere is not an important debate about Misirkov's ethnicity in Macedonia, since he is always regarded as Macedonian as it is obvious in most of his major writings. Since he was not allowed to live in work in Macedonia by the Yugoslav authorities, unwillingly he remained in Bulgaria where he got Bulgarian citizenship since he needed it for his job. Regarding Misirkov's signature under the phrase \"Macedonian Bulgarian\", the Macedonian historians and linguists argue that it means nothing but a Macedonian person with a Bulgarian citizenship, in a political sense, or just a Macedonian person living in Bulgaria. However, the fact is that Misirkov gained Bulgarian citizenship after World War I (1915-1918) and has declared as Bulgarian Macedonian in 1913, which is against the claims of the Macedonian historians and linguists. On the other hand, some Macedonian scholars, like PhD Vlado Popovski, the academician Blaže Ristovski and others, say that Misirkov’s usage of the term “Macedonian Bulgarian” was only a tactic, because in 1914 and many times after that, he repeated his views about the Macedonian national existence.\n\nThe most quoted and most popular Misirkov's thought in Macedonia is:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "356041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=356041", "title": "Left–right political spectrum", "text": "Left–right political spectrum\n\nThe left–right political spectrum is a system of classifying political positions, ideologies and parties, from equality on the left to social hierarchy on the right. Left-wing politics and right-wing politics are often presented as opposed, although a particular individual or group may take a left-wing stance on one matter and a right-wing stance on another; and some stances may overlap and be considered either left- or right-wing depending on the ideology. In France, where the terms originated, the Left has been called 'the party of movement' and the Right 'the party of order'. The intermediate stance is called centrism and a person with such a position is a moderate or centrist.\n\nThe terms \"left\" and \"right\" appeared during the French Revolution of 1789 when members of the National Assembly divided into supporters of the king to the president's right and supporters of the revolution to his left. One deputy, the Baron de Gauville, explained: \"We began to recognize each other: those who were loyal to religion and the king took up positions to the right of the chair so as to avoid the shouts, oaths, and indecencies that enjoyed free rein in the opposing camp\". However, the Right opposed the seating arrangement because they believed that deputies should support private or general interests but should not form factions or political parties. The contemporary press occasionally used the terms \"left\" and \"right\" to refer to the opposing sides.\n\nWhen the National Assembly was replaced in 1791 by a Legislative Assembly comprising entirely new members, the divisions continued. \"Innovators\" sat on the left, \"moderates\" gathered in the centre, while the \"conscientious defenders of the constitution\" found themselves sitting on the right, where the defenders of the Ancien Régime had previously gathered. When the succeeding National Convention met in 1792, the seating arrangement continued, but following the coup d'état of 2 June 1793 and the arrest of the Girondins the right side of the assembly was deserted and any remaining members who had sat there moved to the centre. However, following the Thermidorian Reaction of 1794 the members of the far-left were excluded and the method of seating was abolished. The new constitution included rules for the assembly that would \"break up the party groups\". However, following the Restoration in 1814–1815 political clubs were again formed. The majority ultraroyalists chose to sit on the right. The \"constitutionals\" sat in the centre while independents sat on the left. The terms extreme right and extreme left as well as centre-right and centre-left came to be used to describe the nuances of ideology of different sections of the assembly.\n\nThe terms \"left\" and \"right\" were not used to refer to political ideology per se, but only to seating in the legislature. After 1848, the main opposing camps were the \"democratic socialists\" and the \"reactionaries\" who used red and white flags to identify their party affiliation. With the establishment of the Third Republic in 1871, the terms were adopted by political parties: the Republican Left, the Centre Right and the Centre Left (1871) and the Extreme Left (1876) and Radical Left (1881). The beliefs of the group called the Radical Left were actually closer to the Centre Left than the beliefs of those called the Extreme Left. Beginning in the early twentieth century, the terms \"left\" and \"right\" came to be associated with specific political ideologies and were used to describe citizens' political beliefs, gradually replacing the terms \"reds\" and \"the reaction\". Those on the Left often called themselves \"republicans\", while those on the Right often called themselves \"conservatives\". The words Left and Right were at first used by their opponents as slurs.\n\nBy 1914, the Left half of the legislature in France was composed of Unified Socialists, Republican Socialists and Socialist Radicals, while the parties that were called \"Left\" now sat on the right side. The use of the words Left and Right spread from France to other countries and came to be applied to a large number of political parties worldwide, which often differed in their political beliefs. There was asymmetry in the use of the terms Left and Right by the opposing sides. The Right mostly denied that the left–right spectrum was meaningful because they saw it as artificial and damaging to unity. However, the Left, seeking to change society, promoted the distinction. As Alain observed in 1931: \"When people ask me if the division between parties of the Right and parties of the Left, men of the Right and men of the Left, still makes sense, the first thing that comes to mind is that the person asking the question is certainly not a man of the Left\". In British politics, the terms \"right\" and \"left\" came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s in debates over the Spanish Civil War. The Scottish sociologist Robert M. MacIver noted in \"The Web of Government\" (1947): The right is always the party sector associated with the interests of the upper or dominant classes, the left the sector expressive of the lower economic or social classes, and the centre that of the middle classes. Historically this criterion seems acceptable. The conservative right has defended entrenched prerogatives, privileges and powers; the left has attacked them. The right has been more favorable to the aristocratic position, to the hierarchy of birth or of wealth; the left has fought for the equalization of advantage or of opportunity, for the claims of the less advantaged. Defense and attack have met, under democratic conditions, not in the name of class but in the name of principle; but the opposing principles have broadly corresponded to the interests of the different classes.\n\nGenerally, the left-wing is characterized by an emphasis on 'ideas such as freedom, equality, fraternity, rights, progress, reform and internationalism', while the right-wing is characterized by an emphasis on 'notions such as authority, hierarchy, order, duty, tradition, reaction and nationalism'.\n\nPolitical scientists and other analysts regard the left as including anarchists, communists, socialists, democratic socialists, social democrats, left-libertarians, progressives and social liberals. Movements for racial equality and trade unionism have also been associated with the left.\n\nPolitical scientists and other analysts regard the Right as including Christian democrats, conservatives, right-libertarians, neoconservatives, imperialists, monarchists, fascists, reactionaries and traditionalists.\n\nA number of significant political movements—including feminism and regionalism—do not fit precisely into the left-right spectrum. Though nationalism is often regarded as a right-wing doctrine, many nationalists favor egalitarian distributions of resources. There are also \"liberal nationalists\". Populism is regarded as having both left-wing and right-wing manifestations (see left-wing populism and right-wing populism). Green politics is often regarded as a movement of the left, but in some ways the green movement is difficult to definitively categorize as left or right.\n\nPolitical scientists have observed that the ideologies of political parties can be mapped along a single left–right axis. Klaus von Beyme categorized European parties into nine families, which described most parties. Beyme was able to arrange seven of them from left to right: communist, socialist, green, liberal, Christian democratic, conservative and right-wing extremist. The position of agrarian and regional/ethnic parties varied. A study conducted in the late 1980s on two bases, positions on ownership of the means of production and positions on social issues, confirmed this arrangement.\n\nThere has been a tendency for party ideologies to persist and values and views that were present at a party's founding have survived. However, they have also adapted for pragmatic reasons, making them appear more similar. Seymour Martin Lipset and Stein Rokkan observed that modern party systems are the product of social conflicts played out in the last few centuries. They said that lines of cleavage had become \"frozen\".\n\nThe first modern political parties were liberals, organized by the middle class in the 19th century to protect them against the aristocracy. They were major political parties in that century, but declined in the twentieth century as first the working class came to support socialist parties and economic and social change eroded their middle class base. Conservative parties arose in opposition to liberals in order to defend aristocratic privilege, but in order to attract voters they became less doctrinaire than liberals. However, they were unsuccessful in most countries and generally have been able to achieve power only through cooperation with other parties.\n\nSocialist parties were organized in order to achieve political rights for workers and were originally allied with liberals. However, they broke with the liberals when they sought worker control of the means of production. Christian democratic parties were organized by Catholics who saw liberalism as a threat to traditional values. Although established in the 19th century, they became a major political force following the Second World War. Communist parties emerged following a division within socialism first on support of the First World War and then support of the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nRight-wing extremist parties are harder to define other than being more right-wing than other parties, but include fascists and some extreme conservative and nationalist parties.\n\nGreen parties were the most recent of the major party groups to develop. They have mostly rejected socialism and are very liberal on social issues.\n\nThese categories can be applied to many parties outside Europe. Ware (1996) asserted that even though there are left–right policy differences between them.\n\nIn the 2001 book \"The Government and Politics of France\", Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright say that the main factor dividing the left and right wings in Western Europe is class. The left seeks social justice through redistributive social and economic policies, while the Right defends private property and capitalism. The nature of the conflict depends on existing social and political cleavages and on the level of economic development. Left-wing values include the belief in the power of human reason to achieve progress for the benefit of the human race, secularism, sovereignty exercised through the legislature, social justice and mistrust of strong personal political leadership. To the right, this is regularly seen as anti-clericalism, unrealistic social reform, doctrinaire socialism and class hatred. The Right are skeptical about the capacity for radical reforms to achieve human well-being while maintaining workplace competition. They believe in the established church both in itself and as an instrument of social cohesion; and believe in the need for strong political leadership to minimize social and political divisions. To the Left, this is seen as a selfish and reactionary opposition to social justice, a wish to impose doctrinaire religion on the population and a tendency to authoritarianism and repression.\n\nThe differences between left and right have altered over time. The initial cleavage at the time of the French Revolution was between supporters of absolute monarchy (the Right) and those who wished to limit the king's authority (the Left). During the 19th century, the cleavage was between monarchists and republicans. Following the establishment of the Third Republic in 1871, the cleavage was between supporters of a strong executive on the Right and supporters of the primacy of the legislature on the Left.\n\nThe terms left-wing and right-wing are widely used in the United States, but as on the global level there is no firm consensus about their meaning. The only aspect that is generally agreed upon is that they are the defining opposites of the United States political spectrum. Left and right in the U.S. are generally associated with liberal and conservative respectively, although the meanings of the two sets of terms do not entirely coincide. Depending on the political affiliation of the individual using them, these terms can be spoken with varying implications. A 2005 poll of 2,209 American adults showed that \"respondents generally viewed the paired concepts liberals and left-wingers and conservatives and right-wingers as possessing, respectively, generally similar political beliefs\", but also showed that around ten percent fewer respondents understood the terms left and right than understood the terms liberal and conservative.\n\nThe contemporary left in the United States is usually understood as a category that includes New Deal social-liberals (in contrast to traditions of social democracy more common to Western Europe), Rawlsian liberals and civil libertarians, who are often identified with the Democratic Party. There are also leftists who reject many of the platforms of the Democratic Party in favor of more socialist policies. In general, the term left-wing is understood to imply a commitment to egalitarianism, support for social policies that appeal to the working class and multiculturalism. The contemporary center-left usually defines itself as promoting government regulation of business, commerce and industry; protection of fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of religion (separation of church and state); and government intervention on behalf of racial, ethnic and sexual minorities and the working class.\n\nSome political scientists have suggested that the classifications of \"left\" and \"right\" are no longer meaningful in the modern complex world. Although these terms continue to be used, they advocate a more complex spectrum that attempts to combine political, economic and social dimensions.\n\nA survey conducted between 1983 and 1994 by Bob Altemeyer of Canadian legislative caucuses showed an 82% correlation between party affiliation and score on a scale for right-wing authoritarianism when comparing right-wing and social democratic caucuses. There was a wide gap between the scores of the two groups, which was filled by liberal caucuses. His survey of American legislative caucuses showed scores by American Republicans and Democrats were similar to the Canadian Right and liberals, with a 44% correlation between party affiliation and score.\n\nNorberto Bobbio saw the polarization of the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 1990s as evidence that the linear left–right axis remained valid. Bobbio thought that the argument that the spectrum had disappeared occurred when either the Left or Right were weak. The dominant side would claim that its ideology was the only possible one, while the weaker side would minimize its differences. He saw the Left and Right not in absolute terms, but as relative concepts that would vary over time. In his view, the left–right axis could be applied to any time period.\n\nLibertarian writer David Boaz argued that terms left and right are used to spin a particular point of view rather than as simple descriptors, with those on the \"left\" typically emphasizing their support for working people and accusing the right of supporting the interests of the upper class; and those on the \"right\" usually emphasizing their support for individualism and accusing the Left of supporting collectivism. Boaz asserts that arguments about the way the words should be used often displaces arguments about policy by raising emotional prejudice against a preconceived notion of what the terms mean.\n\nIn 2006, British Prime Minister Tony Blair described the main cleavage in politics as not left versus right, but open versus closed. In this model, attitudes towards social issues and globalism are more important than the conventional economic left–right issues: \"open\" voters tend to be socially liberal, multicultural and in favour of globalism, while \"closed\" voters are culturally conservative, opposed to immigration and in favour of protectionism. This model has seen increased support following the rise of populist and centrist parties in the 2010s.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11146929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11146929", "title": "Operation New Life", "text": "Operation New Life\n\nOperation New Life (23 April – 1 November 1975) was the care and processing on Guam of Vietnamese refugees evacuated from Saigon in the closing days of the Vietnam War. More than 111,000 of the evacuated 130,000 Vietnamese refugees were transported to Guam where they were housed in tent cities for a few weeks while being processed for resettlement. The great majority of the refugees were resettled in the United States. A few thousand were resettled in other countries or chose to return to Vietnam on the vessel \"Tuong Tin\".\n\nIn April 1975, as the North Vietnamese Army (PAVN) advanced on Saigon, the United States carried out a massive and chaotic evacuation of Americans, nationals of allied countries, and Vietnamese who had worked for or been closely associated with the U.S. during the Vietnam War. To deal with the refugees, President Gerald Ford on 18 April 1975 created the Interagency Task Force (IATF) for Indochina, a dozen government agencies with the responsibility to transport, process, receive and resettle Indochinese refugees, nearly all Vietnamese, in the United States. Ford appointed L. Dean Brown of the Department of State to head Operation New Life. Later he was replaced by Julia V. Taft of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). To finance Operation New Life the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act was adopted on 23 May 1975. This act allocated funding of $305 million for the State Department and $100 million for HEW.\n\nNearby countries in Southeast Asia declined to accept the Vietnamese evacuees, fearing that they would have them on their soil permanently. However, Governor Ricardo Bordallo, agreed to grant the Vietnamese temporary asylum on Guam, some from Saigon. On April 23, Rear Admiral George Stephen Morrison, commander of U.S. Naval forces on Guam (and the father of singer Jim Morrison), was ordered to \"accept, shelter, process and care for refugees as they were removed from South Vietnam.\"\n\nMore than 130,000 Vietnamese were evacuated from Vietnam by air and sea during the last few days of April. A few went to other locations, such as Wake Island, but most were transported to Guam by U.S. and Vietnamese naval ships, commercial vessels and military and commercial aircraft. A total of 111,919 Vietnamese would be housed temporarily and processed for entry into the United States on Guam. That total included 2,600 orphans and abandoned children evacuated from Vietnam under Operation Babylift who transited Guam on 3 and 4 April en route to the United States.\n\nGuam had a substantial U.S. military presence to care for the Vietnamese refugees. Andersen Air Force Base on the northern end of the island was the U.S.'s biggest B-52 base and Naval Base Guam was a large deep-water port for naval vessels.\n\nTyphoons frequently impact Guam and the military and civilian personnel involved in Operation New Life feared that a typhoon would strike Guam while the Vietnamese were living in tents and unprotected from the elements. Fortunately, no typhoon hit Guam in 1975.\n\nAlthough not classified legally as \"refugees\" under international refugee law, the Vietnamese on Guam were commonly called refugees as well as \"evacuees\" and \"parolees.\"\n\nThe U.S. military estimated that 13,000 refugees could be housed on Guam and the first arrivals on 23 April were placed in apartments. The numbers, however, reached 20,000 on 27 April, exceeding the capacity of existing housing. The Seabees constructed additional housing, including bulldozing 1,200 acres of brush to create \"Tent City\" for 50,000 people. On 7 May, three merchant ships arrived at Guam carrying 13,000 Vietnamese, the highest number of people to arrive in a single day. The refugee population on Guam peaked on 13 May at 50,450—more than one-half the number of permanent residents of the island. Most of the Vietnamese would spend only two or three weeks on Guam before being transported to the United States, or in a few cases to other countries.\n\nThe objective of the evacuation of South Vietnamese had been to remove U.S. government employees and their families and other Vietnamese with close associations with the United States from the danger of persecution by the victorious North Vietnamese. Many of the refugees were former officers in the South Vietnamese military and officials of the South Vietnamese government. However, a Congressional report summed up characteristics of the refugees who arrived in Guam as follows: \"Half the Vietnamese we intended to get out did not get out – and half who did get out should not have.\" The refugees included \"farmers...an entire fishing village...Many gave the impression of not knowing where they were or why they were there. Some had simply fled in panic.\" However, once in Guam, \"their destination was the United States...how many never intended to travel to continental United States will never be known.\" Nevertheless, the majority of the Vietnamese on Guam were from the educated elite of the country. Twenty percent had attended a University; 40 percent were Catholic, and 35 percent spoke some English—all much higher percentages than those of the Vietnamese population as a whole.\n\nThe United States Attorney General used his authority to grant parole status to the Vietnamese which allowed them to enter the United States and remain permanently.\n\nMore than U.S. 20,000 military personnel from all services were involved in the operation. The military was tasked with providing transportation, operating refugee reception centers in the Pacific and the United States, and assisting civilian agencies in the resettlement program. Expenses incurred by the military were reimbursed from the funds appropriated to the IATF of which the Department of Defense was a member.\n\nAirlifts from Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Air Base unloaded at Andersen Air Force Base. Passengers were escorted to Tent City, where tents erected just hours before awaited them. Those who fled Vietnam by sea landed at the Naval Supply Station at Apra Harbor. First responders included personnel from , the Naval Station and Camp Covington CB Base. Tasked with providing food and shelter, Naval Station Tug Base personnel improvised housing from abandoned warehouses of decommissioned Camp Minron with cots and supplies from the base emergency hurricane supplies, fed hundreds from plastic trash cans full of fish and rice from the base galley. also provided hot meals from her own stores and galley. Outside showers were made from a circle of metal lockers and fire hoses with sprinkler heads. The CB's set up Vietnam-style steel drum toilets, which were immediately overwhelmed.\n\nLockheed C-141 Starlifter and Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft unloaded and personnel processed at NAS Agana, Brewer Field.\n\nTents were set up at Army-run Camp Orote on an abandoned airstrip. At its peak it held a population of 39,331. The camp at Orote Point (called Camp Rainbow) was staffed by units from the U.S. 25th Infantry Division from Schofield Barracks, Hawaii; initially under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Will H. Horn (April–May), and later of Colonel Jack O'Donohue (June–September). The command consisted of the 1st Bn 5th Inf and 1st Bn 27th infantry battalions, elements of the 25th Supply and Transport Battalion, a field hospital from San Antonio, Texas, and intelligence teams.\n\nAdmiral Morrison would later call Operation New Life the most satisfying assignment of his career.\n\nAmong the refugees in Guam were about 1,600 people who requested repatriation to Vietnam. Many of them were South Vietnamese army and naval personnel. The Vietnamese navy had loaded up their ships with people during the evacuation and sailed out to sea, ending up in Guam. Their families often left behind, the soldiers and sailors requested—then demanded—that they be allowed to return to Vietnam.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees initially took responsibility for the repatriation. The Vietnamese government demanded that a lengthy questionnaire be completed for each potential returnee. UNHCR completed the questionnaires and submitted them, but no response was forthcoming from Vietnam. Meantime, the refugees became more insistent in their demands to return, including staging demonstrations and threatening violence and suicide. In September 1975, Julia Taft recommended that the Vietnamese be given the merchant ship \"Tuong Tin\" and allowed to depart Guam for Vietnam. The U.S. Navy renovated the ship for the voyage to Vietnam.\n\nThe State Department was concerned that some among the potential returnees were being coerced by their colleagues into saying they wished to return to Vietnam. State isolated the potential returnees and interviewed each of them individually. Those affirming they wished to return to Vietnam were escorted directly from the interview to the \"Tuong Tin\" for departure. Those declining to return, numbering 45, were escorted to the mostly-empty refugee camps for onward transportation to the U.S. The total number of Vietnamese crowded onto the \"Tuong Tin\" was 1,546, of whom most were men whose families were in Vietnam. The \"Tuong Tin\" departed Guam on 16 October 1975. \nThe fate of the \"Tuong Tin\" was unknown for more than a decade. The ship's captain, Tran Dinh Tru, later told his story. On arrival in Vietnam, Tru and at least some of his shipmates were sent to re-education camps in the rural areas of Vietnam. Tru was imprisoned for 12 years.\n\nThe \"Tuong Tin\" returnees were nearly the last Vietnamese refugees on Guam. The camps there were closed on 23 October and Operation New Life terminated on 1 November 1975.\n\nThe Vietnamese on Guam were flown to one of four military bases: Fort Chaffee in Arkansas, Camp Pendleton in California, Fort Indiantown Gap in Pennsylvania, and Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. There, the U.S. military provided them food and temporary housing while the IATF and charitable organizations gave them language and cultural training and sought sponsors and locations for their resettlement. (See Operation New Arrivals) By 20 December 1975 all the Vietnamese had been resettled in every state and in several foreign countries. The self-congratulations for the success of the program were premature, however, as the coming years would see an even larger flow of Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Laotians fleeing their home countries.\n"}

His himation hangs around his hips, covering his legs and genitals; he holds it in place at his side with his left hand. His back is also partially covered; a bit of cloth lies, mysteriously suspended, on his left shoulder. His weight rests on his right leg, his left leg is left free. The musculature of his arms and his body generally are very finely worked. The head is slightly tilted to the left and his gaze is directed into the distance. There is a dolphin behind the statue to the right, which serves as an additional support for the weight of the statue. The pose is a standard one for Poseidon, Zeus and Hades.\n\n"}
{"id": "1586113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1586113", "title": "R-colored vowel", "text": "R-colored vowel\n\nIn phonetics, an r-colored or rhotic vowel (also called a retroflex vowel, vocalic r, or a rhotacized vowel) is a vowel that is modified in a way that results in a lowering in frequency of the third formant. R-colored vowels can be articulated in various ways: the tip or blade of the tongue may be turned up during at least part of the articulation of the vowel (a retroflex articulation) or the back of the tongue may be bunched. In addition, the vocal tract may often be constricted in the region of the epiglottis.\n\nR-colored vowels are rare, occurring in less than one percent of the languages of the world. However, they occur in two of the most widely spoken languages: North American English and Mandarin Chinese. In North American English, they are found in words such as \"butter\", \"nurse\" and, for some speakers, \"start\". They also occur in Quebec French, some varieties of Brazilian Portuguese, and some Jutlandic dialects of Danish.\n\nIn the IPA, an r-colored vowel is indicated by a hook diacritic () placed to the right of the regular symbol for the vowel. For example, the IPA symbol for schwa is , while the IPA symbol for an r-colored schwa is .\nThis diacritic is the hook of , a symbol constructed by John Samuel Kenyon along with by adding the retroflex hook (right hook) to and . Both and were proposed as IPA symbols by editors of the \"American Speech\" in 1939 to distinguish it from .\n\nThe IPA adopted several ways to transcribe r-colored vowels in its 1947 chart: the turned r ; the superscript turned r , , , , etc.; the retroflex hook , , , , etc.; and added as a variant of in its 1951 chart. In 1976 the retroflex hook was dropped due to insufficient usage. In 1989, after the Kiel Convention, the hook of and was adopted as a diacritic placed on the right side of the vowel symbol for r-colored vowels, e.g. [ɛ˞ o˞ ɔ˞].\nThe use of the superscript turned r () is still commonly seen.\n\nR-colored vowels are found in most rhotic forms of English, including General American and Irish English. The r-colored vowels of General American can be written with \"vowel-r\" digraphs:\n\nIn words such as \"start\", many speakers have r-coloring only in the coda of the vowel, rather than as a simultaneous articulation modifying the whole duration. This can be represented in IPA by using a succession of two symbols such as or , rather than the unitary symbol . \n\nIn European classical singing, dropping or weakening of r-colored vowels has been nearly universal and is a standard part of classical vocal training, but there have always been other singing styles, including traditional Irish singing styles and those of many performers of country music. In certain particular cases, a vowel + /r/ is pronounced instead as two syllables: a non-rhotic vowel followed by a syllabic /r/.\n\nIn Mandarin, the rhotacized ending of some words is the prime way by which to distinguish speakers of Standard Northern Mandarin (Beijing Mandarin) and Southwestern Mandarin from those of other forms of Mandarin in China. Mandarin speakers call this phenomenon \"erhua\". In many words, the \"-r\" suffix () is added to indicate some meaning changes. If the word ends in a velar nasal (\"ng\"), the final consonant is lost and the vowel becomes nasalized. Major cities that have this form of rhotacized ending include Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, Harbin, and Qiqihar. This \"erhua\" has since spread to other provincial capitals not home to Standard Mandarin, such as Shijiazhuang, Jinan, Xian, Chongqing, and Chengdu.\n\nIn rhotic accents of Standard Mandarin, such as those from Beijing, Tianjin, most of the Hebei province (e.g. Tangshan, Baoding, Chengde), eastern Inner Mongolia (e.g. Chifeng, Hailar), and in the Northeast, vocalic r occurs as a diminutive marker of nouns () and the perfective aspect particle (). This also occurs in the middle syllables of compound words consisting of three or more syllables. For example, the name of the famous restaurant Go Believe (狗不理) in Tianjin is pronounced as 'Gourbli' (\"Gǒu(r)bùlǐ\" → \"Gǒurblǐ\"). The name of the street Dazhalan (大栅栏) in Beijing is pronounced as 'Da-shi-lar' (\"Dàshànlàn(r)\" → \"Dàshílàr\").\n\nIn Quebec French, the vowel is generally pronounced and the r-colored vowels are also pronounced in loan words. For example, the word \"hamburger\" can be pronounced , the word \"soccer\" can be pronounced etc.\n\nMany dialects of Brazilian Portuguese express the or phoneme in coda position (when not followed by a vowel in the next word) as rhotacization of the syllable nucleus. This appears in words like (door) and (meat, flesh).\n\nSuch a process can be found among speakers from remote rural regions throughout Brazil, but is an areal feature of , and in particular, where it is found even across major urban areas. More prestigious dialects and idiolects tend to use or guttural pronunciations, and less prestigious ones would have a full-fledged coda (otherwise known as ).\n\nSome people have a rhotic vowel in free variation with a retroflex approximant coda i.e. (color), or with , as is common across the Greater São Paulo and in much of hinterland southern Brazil, while in the case of , the rhotic vowel is often followed by a or , the latter when preceding voiced consonants.\n\nGenerally, in any dialect of Brazilian Portuguese, the deletion of coda or , when those are found in infinitives, is a staple of casual registers, but in educated speech often not so much. When or are produced at the end of infinitives, they are usually not pronounced as a coronal approximant or as vowel coloring.\n\nIn the 1930s the Dravidian language Badaga had two degrees of rhoticity among all five of its vowels, but few speakers maintain the distinction today, and then only in one or two vowels. An example is non-rhotic \"mouth\", slightly rhotacized (\"half retroflexed\") \"bangle\", and fully rhotacized (\"fully retroflexed\") \"crop\".\n\nThe Algic language Yurok illustrated rhotic vowel harmony. The non-high vowels , and could become in a word that has . For example, the root 'three' became in the word 'three (animals or birds)'.\n\nLuobohe Miao also contains .\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12601835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12601835", "title": "Sources of ancient Tamil history", "text": "Sources of ancient Tamil history\n\nThere are literary, archaeological, epigraphic and numismatic sources of ancient Tamil history. The foremost among these sources is the Sangam literature, generally dated to the last centuries BCE to early centuries CE. The poems in Sangam literature contain vivid descriptions of the different aspects of life and society in Tamilakam during this age; scholars agree that, for the most part, these are reliable accounts. Greek and Roman literature, around the dawn of the Christian era, give details of the maritime trade between Tamilakam and the Roman empire, including the names and locations of many ports on both coasts of the Tamil country.\n\nArchaeological excavations of several sites in Tamil Nadu and Kerala have yielded remnants from the Sangam era, such as different kinds of pottery, pottery with inscriptions, imported ceramic ware, industrial objects, brick structures and spinning whorls. Techniques such as stratigraphy and paleography have helped establish the date of these items to the Sangam era. The excavated artifacts have provided evidence for existence of different economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature such as agriculture, weaving, smithy, gem cutting, building construction, pearl fishing and painting.\n\nInscriptions found on caves and pottery are another source for studying the history of Tamilakam. Writings in Tamil-Brahmi script have been found in many locations in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka and also in Egypt and Thailand. mostly recording grants made by the kings and chieftains. References are also made to other aspects of the Sangam society. Coins issued by the Tamil kings of this age have been recovered from river beds and urban centers of their kingdoms. Most of the coins carry the emblem of the corresponding dynasty on their reverse, such as the bow and arrow of the Cheras; some of them contain portraits and written legends helping numismatists assign them to a certain period.\n\nBy far, the most important source of ancient Tamil history is the corpus of Tamil poems, referred to as Sangam literature, generally dated from the last centuries of the pre-Christian era to the early centuries of the Christian era. It consists of 2,381 known poems, with a total of over 50,000 lines, written by 473 poets. Each poem belongs to one of two types: \"Akam\" (inside) and \"Puram\" (outside). The \"akam\" poems deal with inner human emotions such as love and the \"puram\" poems deal with outer experiences such as society, culture and warfare. They contain descriptions of various aspects of life in the ancient Tamil country. The \"Maduraikkanci\" by Mankudi Maruthanaar contains a full-length description of Madurai and the Pandyan country under the rule of Nedunj Cheliyan III. The \"Netunalvatai\" by Nakkirar contains a description of the king’s palace. The \"Purananuru\" and \"Akanaṉūṟu\" collections contain poems sung in praise of various kings and also poems that were composed by the kings themselves. The Sangam age anthology \"Pathirruppaththu\" provides the genealogy of two collateral lines for three or four generations of the Cheras, along with describing the Chera country, in general. The poems in \"Ainkurnuru\", written by numerous authors, were compiled by Kudalur Kizhar at the instance of Chera King \"Yanaikkatcey Mantaran Ceral Irumporai\".The Chera kings are also mentioned in other works such as \"Akanaṉūṟu\", \"Kuruntokai\", \"Natṟiṇai\" and \"Purananuru\". The \"Pattinappaalai\" describes the Chola port city of Kaveripumpattinam in great detail. It mentions \"Eelattu-unavu\" – food from Eelam – arriving at the port. One of the prominent Sangam Tamil poets is known as Eelattu Poothanthevanar meaning Poothan-thevan (proper name) hailing from \"Eelam\" mentioned in \"Akanaṉūṟu\": 88, 231, 307; \"Kurunthokai\": 189, 360, 343 and \"Naṟṟiṇai\": 88, 366.\n\nThe historical value of the Sangam poems has been critically analysed by scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries. Sivaraja Pillay, a 20th-century historian, while constructing the genealogy of ancient Tamil kings from Sangam literature, insists that the Sangam poems show no similarities with ancient Puranic literature and medieval Tamil literature, both of which contain, according to him, fanciful myths and impossible legends. He feels that the Sangam literature is, for the most part, a plain unvarnished tale of the happenings of a by-gone age. Scholars like Dr. Venkata Subramanian, Dr. N. Subrahmanian, Dr. Sundararajan and J.K. Pillay concur with this view. Noted historian K.A.N. Sastri dates the presently available Sangam corpus to the early centuries of the Christian Era. He asserts that the picture drawn by the poets is in obedience to literary tradition and must have been based on solid foundation in the facts of contemporary life; he proceeds to use the Sangam literature to describe the government, culture and society of the early Pandyan kingdom. Kanakalatha Mukund, while describing the mercantile history of Tamilakam, points out that the heroic poetry in Sangam literature often described an ideal world rather than reality, but the basic facts are reliable and an important source of Tamil history. Her reasoning is that they have been supported by archaeological and numismatic evidence and the fact that similar vivid descriptions are found in works by different poets. Dr. Husaini relies on Sangam literature to describe the early Pandyan society and justifies his source by saying that some of the poetical works contain really trustworthy accounts of early Pandyan kings and present facts as they occurred, though they never throw much light about the chronology of their rule.\n\nAmong the critics of using Sangam literature for historical studies is Herman Tieken, who maintains that the Sangam poems were composed in the 8th or 9th century and that they attempt to describe a period much earlier than when they were written.\nTieken's methodology of dating Sangam works has been criticized by Hart, Ferro-Luzzi, and Monius. Robert Caldwell, a 19th-century linguist, dates the Sangam works to a period that he calls the Jaina cycle which was not earlier than the 8th century; he does not offer an opinion on the historical value of the poems. Kamil Zvelebil, a Czech indologist, considers this date quite impossible and says that Caldwell's choice of works are whimsical. Champakalakshmi states that since the Sangam period is often stretched from 300 BCE to 300 CE and beyond, it would be hazardous to use the Sangam works as a single corpus of source for the entire period.\n\nAccording to Encyclopædia Britannica, the Sangam poems were created between the 1st century and 4th century and many of them are free from literary conceits. The Macropaedia mentions that the historical authenticity of sections of Sangam literature has been confirmed by archaeological evidence.\n\nKautilya (c. 370–283 BCE), in his Sanskrit work \"Arthashastra\", mentions the “easy to travel\" trade route to the South and the products of the Pandya kingdom, including some special varieties of pearls. He refers to the city of Madurai and the river Tamaraparani in the Pandya kingdom. The Sinhalese chronicle Mahawamsa claims that King Vijaya (c. 543 BCE) married a daughter of the Pandyan king Kulasekaran, to whom he was sending rich presents every year. Using the references to king Gajabahu I in the Mahawamsa and the \"Uraiperu katturai\" of the Tamil epic \"Cilappatikaram\", historians have arrived at a literary chronological device referred to as the Gajabahu synchronism to date the events mentioned in the Tamil epic to the 2nd century CE. The famous Greek traveler Megasthenes (c. 302 BCE) mentions the “Pandae\" kingdom and refers to it as “that portion of India which lies to the southward and extends to the sea\". The Roman historian Strabo (c. 1st century BCE) mentions the embassies sent by the Pandyas to the court of Augustus, along with a description of the ambassadors from \"Dramira\". He also gives various details about the trading relationship between the Tamil kingdoms and Rome. Pliny the Elder (c. 77 CE) refers to many Tamil ports in his work \"The Natural History\". The \"Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\" (c. 60–100 CE) gives an elaborate description of the Tamil country and describes the riches of a 'Pandian Kingdom':\n\nOne such port, Kudiramalai is mentioned in Greek as \"Hippuros\", a famous port of the Malabar country in Ceylon to the ancient Greeks. Pliny states that in the reign of the Emperor Claudius in 47 CE:\n\nAn embassy of four envoys were sent from the island to Rome, including ambassador-in-chief Rasaiah from the King of Kudiramalai. To the Romans, the Kudiramalai envoys related particulars about their kingdom's inhabitants, including their common life expectancy of 100 years, their government, a council of thirty persons, free civil liberties and laws pertaining to abuse of sovereign power, their trade with the Seres (Chinese), their festivals surrounding \"the chase\", and their delights in the elephant and the tiger. The ambassadors felt their kingdom to be richer than Rome's, although in their eyes Rome put its wealth to much better use. \"The Peutingerian tables\" which speak of a temple of Augustus in the west coast of Tamilakam were composed in 222 CE. The Roman emperor Julian received an embassy from a Pandya about 361. A Roman trading centre was located on the Pandyan coast (Alagankulam—at the mouth of the Vaigai river, southeast of Madurai). The Pandyas also had trade contacts with Ptolemaic Egypt and, through Egypt, with Rome by the 1st century, and with China by the 3rd century. The 1st century Greek historian Nicolaus of Damascus met, at Damascus, the ambassador sent by an Indian King \"named Pandion or, according to others, Porus\" to Caesar Augustus around 13 CE (Strabo XV.1–4, and Strabo XV.1–73).\n\nThe Buddhist Jataka story known as \"Akiti Jataka\" refers to the \"Damila-rattha\" (Tamil country) including the region of Kaveripattinam. In the Petavatthu commentary, the Damila country encompasses the Dakhinapátha.\n\nThe Chinese writer Pan Kou, who lived before the 1st century CE, refers to the city of Kanchipuram in his work \"Tsien han chou\". The Chinese historian Yu Huan in his 3rd century text, the \"Weilüe\", mentions \"The Kingdom of Panyue\":\n\nAccording to Abraham, the Sangam era corresponds roughly to the period 300 BCE–300 CE, based on archaeology. Many historical sites have been excavated in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, many of them in the second half of the 20th century. One of the most important archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu is Arikamedu, located south of Pondicherry. According to Wheeler, it was an Indo-Roman trading station that flourished during the first two centuries CE. It has been suggested that Arikamedu was first established as a settlement c. 250 BCE and lasted until 200 CE. Kodumanal and Perur, villages on the banks of the Noyyal river in Coimbatore district, were situated on the ancient trade route between Karur and the west coast, across the Palghat gap on the Western Ghats. Both sites have yielded remains belonging to the Sangam age. Kaveripumpattinam, also known as Puhar or Poompuhar, is located near the Kaveri delta and played a vital role in the brisk maritime history of ancient Tamilakam. Excavations have been carried out both on-shore and off-shore at Puhar and the findings have brought to light the historicity of the region. The artefacts excavated date between 300 BCE and early centuries CE. Some of the off-shore findings indicate that parts of the ancient city may have submerged under the advancing sea, as alluded to by the Sangam literature. Korkai, a port of the early Pandyas at the Tamraparani basin, is now located 7 km inland due to the retreating shoreline caused by sediment deposition. Alagankulam, near the Vaigai delta, was another port city of the Pandyas and an archaeological site that has been excavated in the recent years. Both the Pandyan ports have provided clues about local occupations, such as pearl fishing. Other sites that have yielded remnants from the Sangam age include Kanchipuram, Kunnattur, Malayampattu and Vasavasamudram along the Palar river; Sengamedu and Karaikadu along the Pennar river; Perur, Tirukkampuliyur, Alagarai and Urayur along the Kaveri river.\nThese excavations have yielded different varieties of ceramics such as black and red ware, rouletted ware and Russet coated ware, both locally made and imported kinds. Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Other artifacts such as brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items, remains of seeds and shells provide clues about the nature of the settlements and the other aspects of life during the Sangam age. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in the material records of Tamilakam are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts.\n\nArcheological evidence for agriculture in the Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping seems to have been undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found at the bottom of the reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.\n\nA research survey at Kodumanal has unearthed the remains of an ancient blast furnace, its circular base distinguishable by its white colour, probably the result of high temperature. Around the base, many iron slags, some with embedded burnt clay, vitrified brick-bats, many terracotta pipes with vitrified mouths and a granite slab, which may have been the anvil, have been recovered. Absence of potsherds and other antiquities has suggested that the smelting place was located outside the boundary of habitation. More furnaces were discovered at the same site with burnt clay pieces with rectangular holes. The pieces were part of the furnace wall, the holes designed to allow a natural draught of air to pass through evenly into the furnace. Many vitrified crucibles were also recovered from this site; one of them notable because it was found in an in situ position. Evidence of steel making is also found in the crucibles excavated at this site. In addition to iron and steel, the metallurgy seems to have possibly extended to copper, bronze, lead, silver and gold objects. At Arikamedu, there were indications of small-scale workshops containing the remains of working in metal, glass, semiprecious stones, ivory and shell. Kodumanal has yielded evidence for the practice of weaving, in the form of a number of intact terracotta spindle whorls pierced at the centre by means of an iron rod, indicating the knowledge of cotton spinning and weaving. To further strengthen this theory, a well preserved piece of woven cotton cloth was also recovered from this site. Dyeing vats were spotted at Arikamedu.\n\nMany brick structures have been located at Kaveripumpattinam during on-shore, near shore and off-shore explorations; these provide proof for building construction during Sangam age. The on-shore structure include an I-shaped wharf and a structure that looks like a reservoir. The wharf has a number of wooden poles planted in its structure to enable anchorage of boats and to facilitate the handling of cargo. Among other structures, there is a Buddhist vihara with parts of it decorated using moulded bricks and stucco. Near shore excavations yielded a brick structure and a few terracotta ring wells. Off-shore explorations located a fifteen course brick structure, three courses of dressed stone blocks, brick bats and pottery. At Arikamedu, there were indications of a structure built substantially of timber, possibly a wharf. Conical jars that could have been used for storing wine and oil have been found near structures that could have been shops or storage areas. Evidence of continued building activity are present at this site, with the most distinctive structures being those of a possible warehouse, dyeing tanks and lined pits.\n\nKodumanal was popular for the gem-cutting industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz are located in the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.\n\nThere are remnants of many of the items imported from and exported to the Roman empire, at Arikamedu. Imported items recovered from here include ceramics such as amphorae and sherds of Arretine ware, glass bowls, Roman lamps, a crystal gem and an object resembling a stylus. Artifacts that may have been meant for export include jewellery, worked ivory, textiles and perhaps leather or leather-related products. Similar looking ornaments have been recovered from Arikamedu and Palatine Hill in Rome, further confirming that this site was a leading trade center. The Pandyan port city Alagankulam has yielded a rouletted pottery ware that bears the figure of a ship on the shoulder portion. This figure is very similar to a finding reported from Ostia, an ancient port of the Romans. Wharf-like structures found at many port cities indicate that they might have been used as docks. Based on marine explorations of various port-sites, it has been suggested that stone anchors may have been used since as early as the 3rd century BCE.\n\nDuring the later half of the 20th century, several inscriptions of the Sangam age have been discovered in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Most of them are written in Tamil-Brahmi script and are found in rocks or on pottery. The information obtained from such inscriptions have been used to corroborate some of the details provided by the Sangam literature.\n\nThe 2nd and 13th rock edicts of Ashoka (273–232 BCE) refers to the Pandyas, Cholas, Cheras and the Satiyaputras. According to the edicts, these kingdoms lay outside the southern boundary of the Mauryan Empire. The Hathigumpha inscription of the Kalinga King, Kharavela, (c. 150 BCE) refers to the arrival of a tribute of jewels and elephants from the Pandyan king. It also talks about a league of Tamil kingdoms that had been in existence 113 years before then.\nThe earliest epigraphic records of the Tamil country in Tamil Nadu were found in Mangulam village near Madurai. The cave inscriptions, deciphered in 1966, have been dated to the 2nd century BC and record the gift of a monastery by Pandyan king Nedunj Cheliyan to a Jain monk. These inscriptions are also the oldest Jain inscriptions in South India and among the oldest in all of India. References to Sangam age Chera dynasty are found in Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions of 3rd century CE found on rocks in Edakal hill in Wynad district of Kerala. The ancient port city of Thondi is mentioned in inscriptions found in Kilavalavu village near Madurai. The early part of the 20th century saw the discovery of about 39 inscriptions in a dozen locations, all near Madurai. The most significant of these were the ones at Alagarmalai and Sittannavasal. The Alagarmalai inscriptions, dated to the 1st century BCE, record the endowments made by a group of merchants from Madurai. Another set of inscriptions from the 2nd century CE, found at Pugalur village near Karur, document the construction of a rock shelter by a Chera king of the Irumporai line for a Jain monk, \"Cenkayapan\". Cave inscriptions at Arachalur, dated to the 4th century, provide evidence for the cultivation of music and dance in the Tamil country. One of the earliest inscriptional evidence of the chieftains of the Sangam age was found at Jambai, a village near the town of Tirukkoyilur in Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu. These inscriptions belonging to the 1st century CE record the grants made by the chieftain Atiyaman Netuman Anci who ruled from Takatur. According to epigraphist I. Mahadevan, there were some reservations initially, about the linguistic details in the inscriptions, but further investigations have confirmed their authenticity. Inscriptions from the 2nd century CE found at Mannarkoil village in Tirunelveli district contain a reference to a \"katikai\", which could mean an assembly of learned persons or an institution of higher learning. An inscription belonging to the early Cholas has been discovered near Tiruchirappalli and has been dated between the 2nd and 4th century.\nAn analysis of the geographical sites of these cave inscriptions points to the possibility of the Tamil-Brahmi script having been created at Madurai around the 3rd century BCE and its disseminations to other parts of Tamil country thereafter.\n\nInscriptions on pottery, written in Tamil-Brahmi, have been found from about 20 archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu. Using methods such as stratigraphy and palaeography, these have been dated between the 2nd century BCE and 3rd century CE. Also found in present-day Andhra Pradesh and Sri Lanka, similar inscriptions in Tamil-Brahmi have been found outside the ancient Tamil country in Thailand and the Red Sea coast in Egypt.\nArikamedu, the ancient port city of the Cholas, and Urayur and Puhar, their early capitals, have yielded several fragmentary pottery inscriptions, all dated to the Sangam age. Kodumanal, a major industrial center known for the manufacture of gems during this period, had remains of pottery with inscriptions in Tamil, Prakrit and Sinhala-Prakrit. Alagankulam, a thriving sea port of the early Pandyas, has yielded pottery inscriptions that mention several personal names including the name of a Chera prince. One of the pottery sherds contained the depiction of a large Roman ship. Many other ancient sites such as Kanchipuram, Karur, Korkai and Puhar have all yielded pottery with inscriptions on them. Outside of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, inscriptions in Tamil-Brahmi have been found in Srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh, Jaffna in modern Sri Lanka, ancient Roman ports of Qusier al-Qadim and Berenike in Egypt. The 2nd century BCE potsherds found in excavations in Poonagari, Jaffna, bear Tamil inscriptions of a clan name – \"vēḷāṉ,\" related to \"velirs\" of the ancient Tamil country. The inscriptions at Berenike refer to a Tamil chieftain Korran.\n\nThe Thiruparankundram inscription found near Madurai in Tamil Nadu and dated on palaeographical grounds to the 1st century BCE, refers to a person as a householder from Eelam (\"Eela-kudumpikan\"). It reads: \"erukatur eelakutumpikan polalaiyan\" - \"Polalaiyan, (resident of) Erukatur, the husbandman (householder) from Eelam. Apart from caverns and pottery, Tamil-Brahmi writings are also found in coins, seals and rings of the Sangam age. Many of them have been picked up from the Amaravathi river bed near Karur. A smaller number of inscribed objects have been picked up from the beds of other rivers like South Pennar and Vaigai. An oblong piece of polished stone with Tamil-Brahmi inscription has been located in a museum in the ancient port city of Khuan Luk Pat in southern Thailand. Based on the inscription, the object has been identified as a touchstone (\"uraikal\") used for testing the fitness of gold. The inscription is dated to 3rd or 4th century.\n\nEpigraphy provides an account of various aspects of Sangam polity and has been used to verify some of the information provided by sources such as literature and numismatics. The names of various kings and chieftains occurring in the inscriptions include Nedunj Cheliyan, Peruvaluthi, Cheras of the Irumporai family, Tittan, Nedunkilli, Adiyaman, Pittan and Korrantai. References to administration includes the chiefs, superintendents, titles of ministers, palace of merchants and the village assembly. Religious references to Buddhist and Jain monks are found frequently, which have provided valuable information explaining the spread of those religions in Tamilakam. Brief mentions of various aspects of the Sangam society such as agriculture, trade, commodities, occupations, the social stratification, flora, fauna, music and dance, names of cities and names of individuals are also found in the inscriptions.\n\nAnother important source of studying ancient Tamil history are the coins that have been found in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. The coins belonging to the Sangam age, found in Tamil Nadu are generally classified into three categories. The first category consists of punch-marked coins from Magadha (400 BCE–187 BCE) and the Satavahanas (200 BCE–200 CE). The second category is made up of coins from the Roman Empire dated from 31 BCE to 217 CE, coins of Phoenicians and Seleucids and coins from the Mediterranean region (c. 300 BCE). The third category of Sangam age Tamil coins are the punch-marked silver, copper and lead coins dated 200 BCE–200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. The coins belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading relationships that the Tamil people had with the kingdoms of northern India and the outside world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam age Tamil polity. The third category of coins, however, have provided direct testimony to the existence of ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.\n\nAmong the many coins attributed to the early Pandyas, are a series of punch-marked coins made of silver and copper, that are considered to belong to the earliest period. Six groups of silver punch-marked coins and one group of copper coins have been analysed so far. All of these punch-marked coins have a stylised fish symbol on their reverse, which is considered the royal emblem of the Pandyas. On the obverse of these coins are a variety symbols such as the sun, the sadarachakra, the trishul, a dog, stupa etc. The first group of silver coins was found at Bodinayakanur, in a hoard containing 1124 coins all belonging to the same type. The remaining coins in the five silver group and the copper group were all found in the Vaigai river bed near Madurai. Four of the six silver groups have been assigned a date close to the end of the Mauryan rule, c. 187 BCE. Since Tamilakam was deficient in metallic silver and since Roman silver did not become available in abundance until later, around 44 BCE, it has been postulated that the Pandyan kings melted silver from the coins brought in by trade with Magadha or some foreign location other than Rome. The names of the Pandyan kings who issued this series of coins is not clear. Another series of coins, all made of copper and found near Madurai, have the fish symbol on the reverse and among other symbols on the obverse, have the legend \"Peruvaluthi\" written in the Tamil-Brahmi script. They have been assigned a date of around 200 BCE and are considered to have been issued by the Pandyan king Peruvaluthi. These coins are represent some of the few instances where the names of Sangam kings appear in non-literary sources. Sangam literature mentions the importance attached to Vedic sacrifices by Tamil kings including the Pandyan Mudukudumi Peruvaludhi. This fact is also corroborated by the discovery of several Pandyan coins that are referred to as the \"Vedic sacrifice\" series. These coins have symbols on their obverse that depict the sacrifices, such as a horse tied to the \"yuba-stambha\", a \"yagna kunta\" and a \"nandhipada\". More coins with animal symbols such as the tortoise, the elephant and the bull have been found and assigned to the Pandyan kings. Some of them even have a human portrait, possibly of the king who issued those coins, on their obverse. There are also Pandyan coins belonging to the 1st century BCE that have symbols depicting pearls, signifying the importance of pearl fishery to the Pandyan kingdom. The excavations at Algankulam, near Madurai, recovered two copper coins of the early Pandyas along with Northern Black Polished Ware. These coins have been assigned a broad time period ranging from 200 BCE to 200 CE.\n\nMany of the coins assigned to the Chera kings of Sangam age with a portrait and the legends \"Makkotai\" or \"Kuttuvan Kotai\" have been found near the Amaravathi river bed in Karur and elsewhere in Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu state. They depict the royal emblem of the Cheras, the bow and arrow symbol, on the reverse. It was generally believed that the Satavahanas were the first indigenous monarchs to issue silver portrait coins. That has been disproved by the discovery of Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins belonging to the 1st century AD or a little later. Silver coins issued by Augustus and Tiberius have over a period of time been discovered in large numbers from the Coimbatore-Karur region.\n\nAmong the Chera coins, the \"Makkotai series\" bears a unique pattern not found in other Tamil coins of its age. They contain both the portrait of a king (facing right) and a written legend, in this case the word \"Makkotai\" written in Tamil-Brahmi script. These coins exhibit similarities with the Roman coins of emperors Augustus and Tiberius; like the Roman coins, the portraits on the Makkotai series do not show any jewellery on the king. They are thought to be made of two separate pieces joined by lead, a practice prevalent elsewhere in India at that time. Official seals of the bearing the name \"Makkotai\" have also been recovered from the river bed; these seals contain the portrait facing left and the legend \"Makkotai\" written backwards (right-to-left). The reverse of the seals is blank. The Makkotai coins and the seals have been assigned a date range of 100 BC to end of 100 AD.\n\nAnother aspect of the portraits on the Makkotai coins are that they do not have identical head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they all have the same written legend. Such an observation has been made of coins assigned to the Western Kshatrapas of Gujarat, which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera coins. Scholars who analyzed the varying portraiture on the Kshatrapa coins have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the coins could be of different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their coins or the coins all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his different ages. Based on such theories, the Chera coins could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.\n\nAnother series of Chera coins depicts various animals along with symbols on its obverse and the Chera emblem on its reverse. Elephant, horse, bull, tortoise and lion are the animals depicted in this series, along with snake and fish. Symbols of inanimate objects include arched hills, battle axe, conch, river, swastika, trident, flowers and the sun.\n\nA few other coins that contain a portrait and a legend have been unearthed; a coin assigned to certain Kuttuvan Kotai with his portrait and the legend \"Kuttuvan Kotai\" is notable for the occurrence of the \"pulli\" in the legend. Based on paleography of the script, it has been assigned a date of the late 1st century to early 2nd century AD. A coin belonging to 100 AD with the legend \"Kollipurai\" and a full-body portrait of a warrior has been assigned to the king Kopperum Cheral Irumporai, as he was known as the victor of Kolli in literature. Another coin of roughly the same period of 100 AD with the legend \"Kolirumporaiy\" and a warrior portrait has been found; it has not been assigned to a single king, but based on the legend, there are at least six Chera kings who could be associated with it.\n\nA Chera coin with the portrait of a king wearing a Roman helmet was discovered from Karur. The obverse side of the silver coin has the portrait of a king, facing left, wearing a Roman-type bristled-crown helmet. This coin maybelong to the 1st century BC and may be earlier to Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins. With a flat nose and protruding lips, he has a wide and thick ear lobe but wears no ear-ring. The person depicted appears to be elderly. Unlike other Chera silver portrait coins, the king's portrait on this coin faces left. The coin points to Romans having had trade contacts with the Chera kings and establishes that the Roman soldiers had landed in the Chera country to give protection to the Roman traders who had come there to buy materials.\n\nArchaeological investigations conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made of copper from near Cochin. This was for the first time, from a stratographic context, coins of Sangam Chera period have been found in Kerala. The coin, which is almost a square in shape, has an elephant facing to the right and some symbols towards the top of the coin. The symbols could not be identified as the upper part of the coin was partially corroded. A drawn bow and arrow was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is an elephant goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear a striking resemblance to the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.\n\nThe number of Chola coins discovered so far are not as many as those of Pandyas; most of them have been found from archeological excavations at Puhar and Arikamedu, and also beds of rivers Amaravathi near Karur and South Pennar near Tirukkoilur. An early Chola coin has also been found in Thailand. The Chola coins do not contain a portrait or a legend and all of them depict symbols of animals and other inanimate objects like the animal series of the Cheras. But, all of them carry the symbol of a tiger, the Chola emblem, on their reverse. One of the coins has been assigned a date earlier than 200 BCE and some others to about the time of Roman influence, which is around the dawn of the Christian era.\n\nParts of the Sangam age Tamil country were ruled over by several independent chieftains, alongside the three crowned monarchs. Among them, coins belonging to the chieftains of the Malayaman clan have been found in Tamil Nadu. Many of them contain a written legend on the obverse and all of them have the image of a flowing river on their obverse. Based on the legends some of these coins have been assigned to specific rulers such as Tirukkannan, also known as Malaiyan Choliya Enadi Tirukkannan, and Tirumudi Kari. A series of coins without a legend but with a horse as the principal motif on the obverse have been assigned to the Malayaman chieftains, because of the river symbol on the obverse. Numismatist R. Krishnamurthy, dates these coins to the period between 100 BCE and 100 CE.\n\nExcavations in the area of Tissamaharama in southern Sri Lanka have unearthed locally issued coins produced between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE, some of which carry Tamil personal names written in early Tamil characters, which suggest that Tamil merchants were present and actively involved in trade along the southern coast of Sri Lanka.\n\n"}

Their works are included in many major modern art collections, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Victoria & Albert Museum. \n\nJaroslava Brychtová, a sculptor, and Stanislav Libenský, originally a painter and later a glass artist, met in 1954. They married in 1963 and worked together until Libenský's death on February 24, 2002. Libenský painted and sketched the designs, and Brychtová made clay sculptures from his designs. Since Libenský's death, Brychtová has continued to produce castings. Their work is characterised by simple block shapes infused with subtle colours and nuances.\n\nStanislav Libenský began his study of glass in 1937 at the Specialized School of Glassmaking in Nový Bor, Czechoslovakia, a region encompassing the Czech-German border called the Sudetenland. When the German army occupied the Sudetenland in 1938, Libenský moved first to the school at Železný Brod, and later to Prague Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design, known as VŠUP (an abbreviation of Vysoká škola uměleckoprůmyslová v Praze) from which he graduated in 1944. His first notable series in glass, created in Nový Bor between 1945 and 1948, were thin crystal vessels, delicately etched and enameled with themes from the Bible and Renaissance art. \n\nIn 1948 Libenský returned to VŠUP, where he studied under Josef Kaplický, a painter, sculptor and architect who headed the school of painting on glass. Through his dynamic teaching style and modernist ideas, Kaplický had a tremendous influence on his students and thus on the independence of glass as an art form in Czechoslovakia. In 1953 Libenský returned to Železný Brod to become the director of the Specialized School of Glassmaking. It was during that time that he met Jaroslava Brychtová, the daughter of the school's co-founder, Jaroslav Brychta. \n\nJaroslava Brychtová began to experiment with casting and carving glass in the late 1940s. She founded the Center for Architectural Glass at the Specialized School of Glassmaking in 1950. Like Libenský, Brychtová studied at VŠUP. The war interrupted her education, but she later finished her studies with a concentration in sculpture. Her teachers were Karel Štipl (from 1945 to 1951) and Jan Lauda (from 1947 to 1950). Jaroslava Brychtová's career at the Specialized School of Glassmaking in Železný Brod spanned 1950 to 1984. The couple began their long collaboration in 1954. when Brychtová created a sculptural glass bowl modeled after a sketch of a bowl-shaped head that Libenský had made. According to Libenský, the two worked well together because he was trained as a painter, and she as a sculptor.\n\nLibenský and Brychtová married in 1963.\n\nThe Czechoslovakian pavilion at the EXPO '58 in Brussels garnered attention for its modern architectural design, its film, acting and ballet presentations, it was Czech glass that attracted the attention of the judges. The entry designed by Libenský and Brychtová, \"Animal Reliefs\" (later known as \"Zoomorphic Stones\"), were cast glass \"stones\". These were smooth on the obverse; on the reverse, animals inspired by the cave paintings of Altamira and Lascaux were cast in negative low relief. The effect presented by this, when viewed through the smooth surface of the glass, is of a three-dimensional form captured within its depths. Incorporated into a concrete wall in the pavilion's \"Glass\" gallery, \"Animal Reliefs\" was awarded a Grand Prix. While the original work did not survive, a recreation of it was installed in the United Nations headquarters in Geneva. In developing the negative modeling technique employed in \"Animal Reliefs\", Brychtová and Libenský created the foundation on which the majority of their later sculptural work was based.\n\nJosef Kaplický’s death in 1962 left a void at VŠUP that was filled by Libenský, who was appointed a professor in the glass department in 1963. Libenský was an excellent teacher who respected the tradition of glass in Czechoslovakia while furthering his own ideas about the modern direction of glass art. His career at the academy lasted nearly one-quarter of a century. During that time, despite the opposition of the Communist government that had taken hold of the country in the late 1940s, Libenský was able not only to influence two generations of glass artists through his teaching but also, through international lecturing and exhibition of his and Jaroslava Brychtová’s works, build international interest in modern Czech glass art. Notable students of Professor Libenský include Jiří Harcuba, František Janák, Marian Karel, Ivana Mašitová and Yan Zoritchak (Ján Zoričák).\n\nMuch of Libenský and Brychtová's architectural work was done for buildings in Czechoslovakia, including two windows, created for the St. Wenceslas Chapel in Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral. Built in the fourteenth century, the historic chapel was reconstructed by the Czech government between 1961 and 1964. Libenský and Brychtová were selected by competition to replace the chapel's original stained glass windows, which dated from 1912–13. The artists created an abstract design for the windows that, in its modern simplicity, departed from the ornate, early sixteenth-century decoration of the chapel. To relate the new to the old, Libenský and Brychtová used the muted grey-brown, grey-green and pink hues in the chapel's frescoes as the predominate colors in their windows. Outside of Czechoslovakia their architectural glass work was seen in World's Fair exhibitions and Czech Embassies. At Expo '67 in Montreal, Canada, they created three large sculptures for the Czechoslovakian Pavilion's \"Hall of Century and Traditions\". These were \"Blue Concretion\", \"Sun of the Century\", and \"Large Conus\". According to Corning Museum of Art curator Tina Oldknow, these large-scale sculptures in glass were \"a revelation\" to the American Studio Glass artists who saw them, including Harvey Littleton, Dale Chihuly and Marvin Lipofsky.\n\nLibenský was awarded honorary doctorates by the Royal College of Art in London in 1994, the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague in 2001, and together with Brychtova, by the University of Sunderland in 1999 and the Rhode Island School of Design in 2000. In 1985 he was named a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et Lettres by the Ministry of Culture in Paris, France. He won the Herder Prize from the University of Vienna, Austria, in 1975. With his wife and collaborative partner, Jaroslava Brychtová, Libenský was accorded a number of honors. the pair were presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award from Urbanglass in Brooklyn, New York, and the Glass Art Society in 1997 and 1996, respectively. They won the Bavarian State Prize and Gold Medal at the Internationale Handwerksmesse in Munich, Germany, in 1995 and 1967, and received Gold Medal awards from Internationales Kunsthandwerk in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1969 and at the VIII Bienal de São Paulo, Brazil, in 1965. Libenský and Brychtová were presented with the Rakow Award for Excellence in Glass from the Corning Museum of Glass in 1984. They received the 1958 Grand Prize at Expo ’58 in Brussels, Belgium.\n\nThe work of Libenský and Brychtová has been collected by public institutions world-wide, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY; Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth; Prague National Museum, Prague, Czech Republic; Cafesjian Museum of Art, Yerevan, Armenia; Museum Bellrive, Zurich, Switzerland; Finnish Glass Museum, Riihimäki; Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Hokkaidō Museum of Modern Art, Sapporo, Japan; National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, Japan; Rijksmuseum Amsterdam; Corning Museum of Glass, Corning, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, California, Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, Ohio; and Museum Jan van der Togt, Amstelveen, The Netherlands ; Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris, France; Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and the Victoria & Albert Museum, London, England.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51214677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51214677", "title": "Tesla US dealership disputes", "text": "Tesla US dealership disputes\n\nTesla, Inc. has faced dealership disputes in several U.S. states as a result of local laws. In the United States, direct manufacturer auto sales are prohibited in many states by franchise laws requiring that new cars be sold only by independent dealers. The electric car manufacturer Tesla maintains that in order to properly explain to their customers the advantages their cars have over traditional vehicles with an internal combustion engine, they cannot rely on third party dealerships to handle their sales.\n\nTesla has an 80% degree of vertical integration in 2016 according to Goldman Sachs. The integration includes own sales channels and proprietary charging infrastructure among others. The high degree is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically focus on engine manufacturing and vehicle assembly, outsourcing 80% of components to suppliers while letting franchises serve as sales points.\n\nSome of Tesla's stated goals are to increase the number and variety of electric vehicles (EVs) available to mainstream consumers by selling its own vehicles in company-owned showrooms and online. Tesla states that owning stores \"creates an information loop from our customers straight into manufacturing and vehicle design\". Tesla attempts to not make a profit on servicing cars.\n\nTesla operates more than 200 stores and galleries around the world, 120 of which are outside the USA. It owns the stores and sells directly to customers via the internet and in non-US stores.\n\nTesla has a low budget for marketing, and uses a referral program and word of mouth to attract buyers.\n\nThere are stores and galleries—usually located in shopping malls—in 26 US states and Washington DC. Customers cannot buy vehicles from stores, only from the Tesla website. The stores serve as showrooms that allow people to learn about the company and its vehicles. Some galleries are located in states with restrictive dealership protection laws which prevent discussing price, financing, and test drives, as well as other restrictions. Tesla has set up mobile-shipping-container \"stores\" and 6 Airstream travel trailers each pulled by a Model X, reaching areas not served by brick-and-mortar shops.\n\nTesla's strategy of direct customer sales and owning stores and service centers is different from the standard dealership model in the US vehicle marketplace. Tesla is the only manufacturer that sells cars directly to customers; all other automakers use independently owned dealerships (partly due to earlier conflict), although some automakers provide online configuration and financing. 48 states have laws that limit or ban manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers, and although Tesla has no independent dealerships, dealership associations in multiple states have filed numerous lawsuits against Tesla, to prevent the company from selling cars. North Carolina and New Hampshire sided with Tesla, while Virginia and Texas sided with dealers. Lack of outlets, and much lower electric vehicle maintenance requirements, reduce the need for service centers. Tesla currently has service centers in 25 states. Media cited direct sales or lack thereof as reasons when selecting the site for Gigafactory 1.\n\nCountries other than USA do not have such laws protecting car dealerships. The Federal Trade Commission recommends allowing direct manufacturer sales, which analysts believe would save buyers 8% per purchase on average. In May 2014, a report prepared by Maryann Keller and Kenneth Elias for the National Automobile Dealers Association states that franchises (such as offered by its members) offer better value for customers than direct sales.\n\nOn October 1, 2014, Michigan House Bill 5606, drafted \"to keep automakers from forcing dealers to charge different documentation fees to different customers,\" was amended with a section stating that a manufacturer shall not \"sell any new motor vehicle directly to a retail customer other than through its franchised dealers.\" The word \"its\" was removed, which assumed the manufacturer already had dealerships. Both houses passed the revised bill the next day, with only one nay vote from Tom McMillin in either house of the Michigan Legislature. Tesla argued that the original law would have allowed them to sell, because they did not yet have franchised dealers. On October 21, General Motors released a statement saying that governor Rick Snyder should sign the bill into law because \"we believe that House Bill 5606 will help ensure that all automotive manufacturers follow the same rules to operate in the State of Michigan.\" The same day, Snyder signed the bill. Tesla responded to the GM statement by saying \"GM distorts the purpose of the franchise laws which are in place not to cement a monopoly for franchised dealers, but rather to prevent companies with existing franchises from unfairly competing against them.\" The law in Michigan even bans manufacturers from operating service centers and from giving test drives. According to Tesla, the law was changed to also prohibit galleries. Michigan denied Tesla's request for a gallery in September 2016, and Tesla filed a federal lawsuit against the State. Tesla opened a gallery showroom in the Nordstrom shop in the Somerset shopping mall in Troy, Michigan in December 2016, with a \"Not For Sale\" sign on the displayed car.\n\n2006 New Mexico Statutes, Section 57-16-5-V prohibits manufacturers like Tesla to be licensed as a dealer, directly or indirectly performing warranty or other services. Despite Tesla owners' pleas to change the law, they still currently depend on out-of-state centers such as Arizona and Colorado for Tesla sales and services.\n\nAlabama regards manufacturer-owned new motor vehicle stores and service centers as \"unfair and deceptive trade practices\". In August 2016 State Senator Tom Whatley introduced Senate Bill 22, assigned to the Senate Tourism and Marketing Committee, which would allow a manufacturer of alternative fuel vehicles to sell and lease its vehicles directly to the public. The bill never made it out of committee.\n\nSouth Carolina bans manufacturer ownership of new car dealerships and manufacturer service/repair of cars they do not own.\n\nLouisiana enacted a law in June 2017 that bans direct to consumer sales of vehicles. \n\nTexas law states \"Except as provided by this section, a manufacturer or distributor may not directly or indirectly:(1) own an interest in a franchised or nonfranchised dealer or dealership;(2) operate or control a franchised or nonfranchised dealer or dealership; or(3) act in the capacity of a franchised or nonfranchised dealer. (Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 2301.476) and \"A motor vehicle shall not be advertised for sale in any manner that creates the impression that it is being offered for sale by the manufacturer or distributor of the vehicle. An advertisement shall not contain terms such as “factory sale,” “fleet prices,” “wholesale prices,” “factory approved,” “factory sponsored,” “manufacturer sale,” use a manufacturer's name or abbreviation in any manner calculated or likely to create an impression that the vehicle is being offered for sale by the manufacturer or distributor, or use any other similar terms which indicate sales other than retail sales from the dealer\" (43 Tex. Admin. Code § 215.261).\n\nThese laws make it illegal to buy a car from Tesla in person, at a Tesla Gallery. Thus, all Texas orders are taken via the internet or over the phone. Texas residents can still easily buy a car from Tesla, but the purchase is handled as an out-of-state transaction. This may mean that the price will not include Texas state sales tax, which instead must be paid when the buyer registers the car with the state. In 2015, Tesla lobbied the Texas Legislature to modify the law to allow Tesla to sell directly to consumers, and specifically allow Tesla employees to discuss \"financing, leasing, or purchasing options\" at the firm's existing stores in Austin, Dallas, and Houston. Texas considered legislation in 2015 to allow Tesla to operate in the state but legislation was not passed.\n\n, most of the GOP delegates support direct sales while Governor Abbott prefers the current system. According to Texans for Public Justice, Tesla spent $1.3m on lobbyists while dealerships spent $1m.\n\nUtah also bans direct auto sales. In connection with Tesla's request in 2016 that the Utah Supreme Court reverse the state's ban on direct auto sales, the automobile dealers filed documents to the court that was interpreted as supporting Tesla's case by stating: 'Tesla builds a car. It has four wheels. You press a pedal with your foot to make it go, and you turn the steering wheel to change direction. That you plug it in rather than gas it up is a trifle'. Tesla has a gallery showroom open in Salt Lake City that was originally intended to be a store. In 2017 the Utah Supreme Court upheld the law banning manufacturers from having any controlling interest in an autodealer.\n\nAs of March 2018, H.B. 369 Auto Dealership License Amendments that would allow manufacturer direct sales, has passed the House with no votes against it and passed the Senate with only a single vote against it.\n\nConnecticut does not allow manufacturer direct sales. Tesla operates at gallery in Greenwich that the Connecticut Automotive Retailers Association is attempting to get shut down via a lawsuit. As of March 2018, Tesla is appealing a ruling that they operate the Greenwich gallery as an unlicensed dealership.\n\nIn 2015, 2016, and 2017, bills were introduced in the legislature to allow licensing electric vehicle manufactures as dealers.\nAs of March 2018, H.B. No. 5310 was introduced that would allow manufacturer direct electric vehicle sales. The 2018 bill passed the Joint Committee on Transportation on a 25 to 11 vote on 23 March.\n\nWest Virginia does not allow Tesla-owned stores or showrooms.\n\nA legislative bill is being considered in Wisconsin to allow only electric vehicle manufactures to sell directly. The bill is opposed by the Wisconsin Automobile Dealers & Truck Association.\n\nNebraska prohibits Tesla direct sales, but Legislative Bill 830 was introduced in 2018 in an attempt to change the law.\n\nOklahoma currently bans direct sales by auto manufacturers, but legislation was introduced in February 2018 to attempt to allow it.\n\nTesla opened its first and only Colorado store in Boulder in 2009. A 2010 revision to the state dealership law removed the word \"franchised\". This closed the loophole that Tesla had used to open a direct dealership but grandfathered in the existing single store. This limitation was supported by the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association. The store moved from Boulder to the Park Meadows shopping mall in Lone Tree in 2011.\n\nShowrooms/galleries have since been opened in Aspen, Vail, and the Cherry Creek Shopping Center in Denver. There is a service center in Denver and a service center and showroom in Littleton.\n\nA large service center and store is being built in Superior, Colorado in Boulder County, targeted for spring 2019 opening.\n\nTesla has one store in North Carolina, but the state would not grant Tesla a dealer license for a second location in 2016. A legislative bill that would allow six Tesla stores was shelved in 2017.\n\nIn Virginia Tesla has obtained license from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for a single direct sales dealership (Tysons Corner). Upon learning of Tesla's attempt to obtain a second dealership in the state, the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association filed a lawsuit in March 2016 against both Tesla and the DMV to prevent the licensing of the second dealership. In September 2016, the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (VDMV) recommended ending Tesla direct sales, as at least 11 dealerships were interested in selling Tesla vehicles. The VDMV later allowed Tesla to open another shop (Richmond), as Tesla has no dealerships to compete against; the 11 interested dealerships would not be able to compete on undiscounted prices, as Tesla has the same price online and in shops. Third-party profits could come from servicing as is traditional, but Tesla already has satisfactory servicing.\n\nThe Virginia Automobile Dealers Association continues to use the legal system in an attempt to prevent Tesla from opening more than a single store and is currently appealing the ruling by the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles allowing the second store to be opened. The Dealers Association also had state Senators remove a governor-appointed Tesla employee from the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board, created in 1995, that regulates car dealers in the state.\n\nOn March 10, 2014, it was announced that New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission and Governor Chris Christie's administration would be holding a meeting to pass a new proposal into law. This new proposal, PRN 2013-138, was announced one day before it was to be put into law. Tesla responded by saying that the proposal \"seeks to impose stringent licensing rules that would, among other things, require all new motor vehicles to be sold through middlemen and block Tesla's direct sales model,\" and that \"[Governor Christie's] Administration has decided to go outside the legislative process by expediting a rule proposal that would completely change the law in New Jersey.\" The law was passed, and \"Tesla will no longer [be able to] sell electric cars in New Jersey, effective April 1\". Diarmuid O'Connell, Tesla Vice President of Business Development, said, \"Worse, it has done so without any reasonable notice or even a public hearing.\" \"Forbes\" contributor Mark Rogosky said, \"The state's new rules protect its auto dealers from having to compete with Tesla's direct sales model\"; he points out that this is a direct contrast from what Christie said earlier, \"We are for a free-market society that allows your effort and ingenuity to determine your success, not the cold, hard hand of the government.\" Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for the Christie administration, responded by saying \"it was the [Tesla Motors] company, not the governor's office, that was attempting to bypass normal procedures.\". In March 2015, the ban on Tesla Motor's operations in New Jersey was lifted, but with restrictions (maximum of 4 locations, and 1 service center).\n\nIn May 2015, Maryland approved, through House Bill 235, direct Tesla sales to customers beginning in October 2015, though limiting the statewide number of stores to only four. The legislation was crafted specifically for Tesla and allows only four manufacturers of electric or non-fossil fuel burning vehicles without existing franchisees to be licensed to sell direct to the public.\nPennsylvania enacted a law in 2014 that allows Tesla to open up to five stores.\n\nIn 2014, New York banned direct sales but grandfathered in five Tesla stores. Tesla operates two galleries in addition to its five stores.\n\nThere is proposed legislation (Senate bill S6600A and Assembly bill A8248A) to allow more stores. The Eastern New York Coalition of Automotive Retailers is opposed to this as is the Rochester Automobile Dealers Association.\n\nSince 2015, Georgia law no longer restricts Tesla to 150 car sales per year but limits sales to five locations.\n\nIn 2013, New Hampshire passed legislation to allow auto manufacturers with no existing franchise dealer in the state to engage in direct sales.\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Public Safety ruled in 2013 that the original dealer law \"does not prohibit a manufacturer from becoming licensed as a dealer in Minnesota\". The dealership association in the state failed in their attempt to get the law changed to block Tesla.\n\nA 2014 Washington state law outlawed direct sales but grandfathered in Tesla.\n\nAfter an almost two year court battle with the Massachusetts State Automobile Dealers Association, a September 2014 ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court allowed Tesla to begin selling directly in the state.\n\nA Missouri circuit court ruled in August 2016 to end direct sales, confirmed in late December 2016, and delayed in early January while the Missouri Department of Revenue appeals the former verdict. In December 2017 an appeals court reversed the circuit court's decision, saying the Missouri Automobile Dealers Association did not have standing to sue.\n\nWyoming banned direct sales until a law change in 2017 that created a direct sale manufacturer's license. Electric cars were seen as a way to promote the use of coal mined in the state.\n\nArizona blocked direct sales until June 2017 when an administrative law judge ruled that the Arizona Department of Transportation interpreted the law incorrectly. This was after a years legal long battle by Tesla.\n\nIndiana allows a service center and manufacturer sales for 30 months, ending direct Tesla sales by the end of 2017. A legislative proposal had further restrictions, opposed by Tesla. The Roads and Transportation committee approved a modification that grandfathered Tesla, but maintained the ban on all new direct sales by other automakers.\n\nIn December 2017, Tesla was granted a license by the state of Rhode Island after DMV lawyers concluded that the law blocking direct auto sales only applied to manufactures that have franchise dealers. Tesla plans to begin sales in 2018.\n\nAs of March 21st, 2018, Utah Governor Herbert signed into law allowing Tesla direct sales in the state.\n\nIn 2014, Consumer Reports performed a mystery shopper survey of 19 secret shoppers in 85 dealerships, querying electric vehicles (EV). Most shoppers found it to be a positive experience, although 35 dealerships recommended petrol cars instead, and 13 discouraged EVs. The most knowledgeable dealerships were Chevrolet, and the least were Toyota.\n\nIn 2016, two shopper surveys showed contrasting shopping experiences between Tesla and traditional dealerships. One performed by the environmental organization Sierra Club found that in 14% of traditional dealerships, their electric cars were not charged to test drive, and 33% did not discuss $7,500 tax credits.\n\nAnother study by industry analyst Pied Piper using mystery shoppers found that Tesla sales stores (not galleries) differed among each other on sales techniques, and many stores were reluctant to engage in closing a sale.\n\nCustomers generally view car shopping as a challenging experience.\n"}
{"id": "14238656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14238656", "title": "The Man from Earth", "text": "The Man from Earth\n\nThe Man from Earth is a 2007 American drama science fiction film written by Jerome Bixby and directed by Richard Schenkman. It stars David Lee Smith as John Oldman, the protagonist. The screenplay was conceived by Jerome Bixby in the early 1960s and completed on his deathbed in April 1998. The film gained recognition in part for being widely distributed through Internet peer-to-peer networks, which raised its profile. The film was later adapted by Schenkman into a stage play of the same name.\n\nThe plot focuses on John Oldman, a departing university professor, who claims to be a Cro-Magnon (or Magdalenian caveman) who has secretly survived for more than 14,000 years. The entire film is set in and around Oldman's house during his farewell party and is composed almost entirely of dialogue. The plot advances through intellectual arguments between Oldman and his fellow faculty members.\n\nProfessor John Oldman is packing his belongings onto his truck, preparing to move to a new home. His colleagues show up to give him an impromptu farewell party: Harry, a biologist; Edith, an art history professor and devout Christian; Dan (Tony Todd), an anthropologist; Sandy, a historian who is in love with John; Dr. Will Gruber, a psychiatrist; Art, an archaeologist; and his student Linda.\n\nAs John's colleagues press him to explain the reason for his departure, he slowly, and somewhat reluctantly, reveals that he is a prehistoric caveman who has lived for more than 14 millennia, and that he relocates every ten years to keep others from realizing that he does not age. He begins his tale under the guise of a possible science-fiction story, but eventually stops speaking in hypotheticals and begins answering questions from a first-person perspective. His colleagues refuse to believe his story. John continues his tale, relating how he was a Sumerian for 2000 years, a Babylonian, and eventually went east to become a disciple of Gautama Buddha. He claims to have been given a chance to sail with Christopher Columbus (admitting that at the time he still believed the earth was flat) and to have befriended Van Gogh (one of whose original paintings he apparently owns, a gift from the artist himself).\n\nIn the course of the conversation, each of John's colleagues questions his story based on knowledge from his or her own academic specialty. Harry, the biologist, struggles with how biology could allow for the possibility of a human being living for so long. Art, the archaeologist, questions John about events in prehistory. He exclaims that John's answers, though correct, could have come from any textbook; John rejoins that, like any human, his memory is imperfect and he only sees events from his own narrow perspective, so he is not all-knowing. Will, the psychiatrist, questions if John feels guilt for outliving everyone he has ever known and loved, and threatens John with a gun (which is later revealed to have been unloaded) before temporarily leaving. John then learns from the group that Will's wife had died the previous day after a long illness.\n\nThe discussion turns to the topic of religion. John mentions that he is not a follower of a particular religion; though he does not necessarily believe in an omnipotent God, he does not discount the possibility of such a being's existence. Pressed by the group, John reluctantly reveals that in trying to take Buddha's teachings to the west, into the eastern Roman Empire, he became the inspiration for the Jesus story. After this revelation, emotions in the room run high. Edith begins crying. Will demands that John end his tale and give the group a sense of closure by admitting it was all a hoax, and threatens to have John involuntarily committed for psychiatric evaluation should he refuse to do so. John appears to ruminate over his response before finally \"confessing\" to everyone that his story was a prank.\n\nJohn's friends leave the party with various reactions: Edith is relieved; Harry and Dan indicate an open mind; Art never wants to see John again; Will still believes John is mad and still wants him committed; Sandy and Linda clearly believe John. After everyone else but Will and Sandy have left, Will overhears John and Sandy's conversation, which suggests the story could be true after all. John mentions some of the pseudonyms he has used over the years, and Will realizes one was his father's name. He asks John questions that only his father could answer and, when John does answer correctly, Will is shocked before having emotional breakdown, suffers a heart attack and dies in their arms. After the body has been taken away, Sandy realizes this is the first time John has seen one of his grown children die. John wordlessly gets in his truck and starts to drive to an unknown destination. Then he stops and waits for Sandy, who walks over to the truck.\n\nIn order of appearance:\n\nThe story is Jerome Bixby's last work, which he completed on his deathbed in April 1998. Bixby dictated the last of his screenplay to his son, screenwriter Emerson Bixby. After Jerome Bixby's death, the script was given to Richard Schenkman to direct on a $200,000 budget.\n\nThe film screened at the San Diego Comic-Con Film Festival in July 2007, and premiered theatrically in Hemet, California, and Pitman, New Jersey, in October 2007. It was released on DVD in North America by Anchor Bay Entertainment on November 13, 2007, and became available for digital rental and sale at iTunes on September 22, 2009. It won the grand prize for Best Screenplay and first place for Best Feature at the Rhode Island Film Festival in August 2007.\n\nProducer Eric D. Wilkinson has publicly thanked users of BitTorrent who have distributed the film without express permission, saying that it has lifted the profile of the film far beyond the financier's expectations; he encouraged fans to purchase the DVD or donate.\n\nIGN gave it an 8 out of 10, calling it \"intellectual sci-fi\". DVD Verdict criticized the heavy-handed ending, saying that one's opinion of the film would be shaped by views on religion.\n\nThe film has been nominated for and won numerous awards.\n\n\nAll music performed by Mark Hinton Stewart.\n\n\nIn 2012, Richard Schenkman adapted the film to a play, which received positive reviews.\n\nThe theater play was also staged in Greece in 2013 .\n\nA sequel, \"\" was released in 2017. Filming began on June 2, 2016 and ended on June 16. The producers have stated on Facebook that it may be the first in a series.\n\nThis followed two previous attempts at producing sequels. A Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund a sequel named \"The Man From Earth II: Man From Earth Millennium\" was announced in September 2013, but it was not able to collect the minimum-required supporting by October 2013. Another attempt was then made to crowdfund a series, \"Man From Earth: The Series\", based on the film. The second crowd-funding effort completed successfully in August 2014.\n\n\n"}

The pattern was first described as a possible Native American carving in 1873. The identification as a \"medieval knight\" dates to 1954.\n\nThe rock and carving is first mentioned in print in an 1873 addition of the \"Gazetteer of Massachusetts\" and was described as \"There upon its face a rude figure, supposed to have been cut by some Indian Artist.\" In an 1883 town history, the carving is described as \"A broad ledge which crops out near the house of William Kitteredge has upon its surface grooves made by glaciers. Rude outlines of the human face have been traced upon it, and the figure is said to be the work of Indians.\" The carving was subsequently identified as a broken Norse Sword by William Goodwin in his book on the America's Stonehenge site.\n\nFrank Glynn, president of the Archaeological Society of Connecticut, re-located the carving and following discussions with T. C. Lethbridge about Goodwin's theory, chalked in a full figure in 1954, resembling a medieval knight, with a sword and shield, and he is usually said to be the \"discoverer of the Westford Knight.\" It was Lethbridge who suggested to Glynn that the sword was not of Viking origin, but was \"a hand-and-a-half wheel pommel sword\" common in 14th century North Britain.\n\nThe current interpretation by those who advocate that the feature on the rock is a human figure is that it commemorates a fallen member of the party of Henry Sinclair, a Scottish Earl from Orkney, whom some believe to have made a voyage to the New World in 1398, traveling to Nova Scotia and New England. According to Raymond Ramsey in 1972, the shield carried by the knight in the image was found to support this belief, when \"English heraldic experts consulted by Lethbridge definitely identified arms on the shield as belonging to the Sinclairs of Scotland\". Usually it is claimed that the knight is Sir James Gunn, a member of Clan Gunn and a Knight Templar who reportedly traveled with Sinclair. The monument next to the \"knight\" commemorates this interpretation, stating as fact that Sinclair and his party traveled to present-day Massachusetts. Believers in this theory often cite the Newport Tower in Newport, Rhode Island as further evidence to support their claim.\n\nThe theory has no credibility in scholarship. It was mentioned in an \"Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology\" in 2010.\n\nA recent investigation of the rock by David K. Schafer, Curatorial Assistant for Archaeology at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University, concluded that except for the \"sword handle\", which is definitely a punch carving, the entire feature consists of naturally formed scratches caused by glaciation. The local town historian of Westford has stated that there is evidence that the T-shaped inscription was made in the late 19th century. There are some historians who believe that the area around the rock has undergone erosion since the clearing of trees in the 18th century, and that during the time of the alleged voyage by Sinclair, the rock may have been in a hardwood forest covered by of earth. There are some historians who claim that the timing is inconsistent with documented history, as at the time of the alleged voyage (1398), the Order of the Knights Templar was not in existence, having been publicly disbanded ninety years earlier.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "137788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137788", "title": "Zecharia Sitchin", "text": "Zecharia Sitchin\n\nZecharia Sitchin (July 11, 1920 – October 9, 2010) was an author of books proposing an explanation for human origins involving ancient astronauts. Sitchin attributed the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the \"Anunnaki\", which he stated was a race of extraterrestrials from a planet beyond Neptune called \"Nibiru\". He asserted that Sumerian mythology suggests that this hypothetical planet of Nibiru is in an elongated, 3,600-year-long elliptical orbit around the sun. Sitchin's books have sold millions of copies worldwide and have been translated into more than 25 languages.\n\nSitchin's ideas have been rejected by scientists and academics, who dismiss his work as pseudoscience and pseudohistory. His work has been criticized for flawed methodology and mistranslations of ancient texts as well as for incorrect astronomical and scientific claims.\n\nSitchin was born in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR and raised in Mandatory Palestine. He received a degree in economics from the University of London, and was an editor and journalist in Mandatory Palestine (which in 1948 became the modern state of Israel), before moving to New York in 1952. While working as an executive for a shipping company, he taught himself Sumerian cuneiform and visited several archaeological sites.\n\nSimilar to earlier authors such as Immanuel Velikovsky and Erich von Däniken, Sitchin advocated hypotheses in which extraterrestrial events supposedly played a significant role in ancient human history.\n\nAccording to Sitchin's interpretation of Mesopotamian iconography and symbolism, outlined in his 1976 book \"The 12th Planet\" and its sequels, there is an undiscovered planet beyond Neptune that follows a long, elliptical orbit, reaching the inner solar system roughly every 3,600 years. This planet is called Nibiru (although Jupiter was the planet associated with the god Marduk in Babylonian cosmology). According to Sitchin, Nibiru (whose name was replaced with MARDUK in original legends by the Babylonian ruler of the same name in an attempt to co-opt the creation for himself, leading to some confusion among readers) collided catastrophically with Tiamat (a goddess in the Babylonian creation myth the \"Enûma Eliš\"), which he considers to be another planet once located between Mars and Jupiter. This collision supposedly formed the planet Earth, the asteroid belt, and the comets. Sitchin states that when struck by one of planet Nibiru's moons, Tiamat split in two, and then on a second pass Nibiru itself struck the broken fragments and one half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt. The second half, struck again by one of Nibiru's moons, was pushed into a new orbit and became today's planet Earth.\n\nAccording to Sitchin, Nibiru (called \"the twelfth planet\" because, Sitchin claimed, the Sumerians' gods-given conception of the Solar System counted all eight planets, plus Pluto, the Sun and the Moon) was the home of a technologically advanced human-like extraterrestrial race called the \"Anunnaki\" in Sumerian myth, who Sitchin states are called the \"Nephilim\" in Genesis. He wrote that they evolved after Nibiru entered the solar system, and they first arrived on Earth probably 450,000 years ago, looking for minerals, especially gold, which they found and mined in Africa. Sitchin states that these \"gods\" were the rank-and-file workers of the colonial expedition to Earth from planet Nibiru.\n\nAccording to Sitchin, Enki (the Sumerian god of water and human culture) suggested that to relieve the Anunnaki, who had mutinied over their dissatisfaction with their working conditions, that primitive workers (\"Homo sapiens\") be created by genetic engineering as slaves to replace them in the gold mines by crossing extraterrestrial genes with those of \"Homo erectus\". According to Sitchin, ancient inscriptions report that the human civilization in Sumer, Mesopotamia, was set up under the guidance of these \"gods\", and human kingship was inaugurated to provide intermediaries between mankind and the Anunnaki (creating the \"divine right of kings\" doctrine). Sitchin believes that fallout from nuclear weapons, used during a war between factions of the extraterrestrials, is the \"evil wind\" described in the Lament for Ur that destroyed Ur around 2000 BC. Sitchin states the exact year is 2024 BC. Sitchin says that his research coincides with many biblical texts, and that biblical texts come originally from Sumerian writings.\n\nSince the release of his first book \"The 12th Planet\" in 1976, Sitchin has written seven other books as part of his \"Earth Chronicles\" series, as well as six other companion books. Sitchin's books have sold millions of copies worldwide and have been published in more than 25 languages. \"New York Times\" reporter Corey Kilgannon has noted that despite academic dismissal of his work, Sitchin has \"a devoted following of readers\".\n\nCritic Michael S. Heiser has called Sitchin \"arguably the most important proponent of the ancient astronaut hypothesis over the last several decades\". Sitchin was a frequent guest on the Coast to Coast AM radio show, which in 2010 presented Sitchin with a lifetime achievement award. \"Gods of the New Millennium\" author Alan F. Alford admits he initially became \"infatuated\" with Sitchin's hypotheses but later became a critic of Sitchin's interpretations of myth.\n\nAccording to some writers, Sitchin's ideas, along with those of Erich von Däniken may have influenced the beliefs of the religious sect of Raëlism, and writer Mark Pilkington sees the mythology of Japan's Pana Wave religious group as rooted in Sitchin's \"The 12th Planet\" and its sequels.\n\nThe 1994 movie \"Stargate\", directed by Roland Emmerich, and the 2009 video game \"The Conduit\" drew some conceptual inspiration from Sitchin's ideas, while screenwriter Roberto Orci says the villains of the film \"Cowboys & Aliens\" were inspired by Sitchin's conceptualization of the Anunnaki as gold-mining aliens.\n\nIn 2000, Lorin Morgan-Richards' theatrical performance of \"ENKI\", based on the writings of Zecharia Sitchin, premiered in Cleveland, Ohio under the choreography of Michael Medcalf.\n\nIn 2016, Kazem Finjan, the Iraqi Minister of Transport, claimed at a press conference that Sumerians had built and used an airport in the Dhi Qar Governorate to launch spaceships from 5000 years ago. He cited the work of Sitchin and others to support his assertion.\n\nCriticism of Sitchin's work falls primarily into three categories: translations and interpretations of ancient texts, astronomical and scientific observations, and literalism of myth.\n\nWhen Sitchin wrote his books, only specialists could read the Sumerian language. However, sources such as the 2006 book \"Sumerian Lexicon\" have made the language more accessible to non-experts.\n\nAmerican biblical scholar Michael S. Heiser states he has found many inaccuracies in Sitchin's translations and challenges interested parties to use this book to check their validity. Prof. Ronald H. Fritze, author of the book \"Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-religions\", mentions the example of Sitchin's claim that the Sumerian sign \"DIĜIR\" means \"pure ones of the blazing rockets\", adding that \"Sitchin's assignment of meanings to ancient words is tendentious and frequently strained.\" Fritze also commented on Sitchin's methodology, writing that \"When critics have checked Sitchin's references, they have found that he frequently quotes out of context or truncates his quotes in a way that distorts evidence in order to prove his contentions. Evidence is presented selectively and contradictory evidence is ignored.\"\n\nSitchin bases his arguments on his personal interpretations of pre-Nubian and Sumerian texts, and the seal VA 243. Sitchin wrote that these ancient civilizations knew of a twelfth planet, when in fact they only knew five. Hundreds of Sumerian astronomical seals and calendars have been decoded and recorded, and the total count of planets on each seal has been five. Seal VA 243 has 12 dots that Sitchin identifies as planets. When translated, seal VA 243 reads \"You're his Servant\" which is now thought to be a message from a nobleman to a servant. According to Heiser, the so-called sun on Seal VA 243 is not the Sumerian symbol for the sun but is a star, and the dots are also stars. The symbol on seal VA 243 has no resemblance to the hundreds of documented Sumerian sun symbols.\n\nIn a 1979 review of \"The Twelfth Planet\", Roger W. Wescott, Professor of Anthropology and Linguistics at Drew University, Madison, New Jersey, noted Sitchin's amateurishness with respect to the primacy of the Sumerian language:\n\nSitchin's \"planetary collision\" hypothesis does superficially resemble one suggested by modern astronomers—the giant impact hypothesis of the Moon's formation about 4.5 billion years ago by a body impacting with the newly formed Earth. However, Sitchin's proposed series of rogue planetary collisions differ in both details and timing. As with Immanuel Velikovsky's earlier \"Worlds in Collision\" thesis, Sitchin states that he has found evidence of ancient human knowledge of rogue celestial motions in a variety of mythological accounts. In Velikovsky's case, these interplanetary collisions were supposed to have taken place within the span of human existence, whereas for Sitchin these occurred during the early stages of planetary formation, but entered the mythological account passed down via the alien race which purportedly evolved on Nibiru after these encounters.\n\nAccording to former Immanuel Velikovsky assistant turned prolific critic, C. Leroy Ellenberger, \"[Sitchin states that] from an equal start, the Nephilim evolved on Nibiru 45 million years ahead of comparable development on Earth with its decidedly more favorable environment. Such an outcome is unlikely, to say the least, since Nibiru would spend over 99% of its time beyond Pluto. Sitchin's explanation that heat from radioactive decay and a thick atmosphere keep Nibiru warm is absurd and does not address the problem of darkness in deep space. Also unexplained is how the Nephilim, who evolved long after Nibiru arrived, knew what happened when Nibiru first entered the solar system.\"\n\nThe scenario outlined by Sitchin, with Nibiru returning to the inner solar system regularly every 3,600 years,\n\n... implies an orbit with a semi-major axis of 235 astronomical units, extending from the asteroid belt to twelve times farther beyond the sun than Pluto. Elementary perturbation theory indicates that, under the most favorable circumstances of avoiding close encounters with other planets, no body with such an eccentric orbit would keep the same period for two consecutive passages. Within twelve orbits the object would be either ejected or converted to a short period object. Thus, the failed search for a trans-Plutonian planet by T.C. Van Flandern, of the U.S. Naval Observatory, which Sitchin uses to bolster his thesis, is no support at all.\n\nSitchin in \"the case of Adam's alien genes\" states that 223 genes found by the Human Genome Sequencing Consortium are without the required predecessors on the genomic evolutionary tree. Later researchers have argued that the conclusion from the Human Genome Sequencing Consortium cannot be drawn due to a lack of a comprehensive gene database for comparison. An analysis by Salzberg identified 40 potential genes laterally transferred into the genome from prokaryotic organisms. Salzberg also argues that gene loss combined with sample size effects and evolutionary rate variation provide an alternative, more biologically plausible explanation.\n\nPeter James, co-author of the controversial book \"Centuries of Darkness\", has criticized Sitchin both for ignoring the world outside Mesopotamia and more specifically for misunderstanding Babylonian literature:\n\nWilliam Irwin Thompson comments on what he calls Sitchin's 'literalism':\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A ZNIEFF is not a measure of regulatory protection, but an inventory. It corresponds to the census of outstanding natural land areas in the twenty-two metropolitan areas as well as the overseas departments of France. The designation of a ZNIEFF based primarily on the presence of species or groups of species with strong heritage interest. The presence of at least one population of critical species ( in French) defines a ZNIEFF.\n\nThis is one of the bases for prioritizing natural heritage issues as part of the , or , (SCAP), etc. It is used for environmental impact assessment. The Belgian equivalent of the ZNIEFF is the (SGIB).\n\n\nThere are two types of zones:\n\nAn inventory \"ZNIEFF second generation\" was launched in 1996, consisting of an update with harmonization of the methods of carrying out the inventory, better integrating some criteria \"feature\" of ecosystem.\n\nUp to 9 April 2013, ZNIEFFs were upgraded and validated for the following territories: Limousin, Normandy (Upper and Lower), Champagne-Ardenne, Picardie, Pays-de-la-Loire, Poitou-Charentes, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Rhône-Alpes, Center, Corsica, Languedoc-Roussillon, Ile-de-France (excluding Seine-et-Marne), Auvergne, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Lot-et-Garonne, Guyana and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon.\n\nThis inventory is, in addition to an instrument of knowledge, one of the major elements of French conservation policy and taking into account the environment and spatial planning (green belt, ecological network (including European green infrastructure), protective measures, environmental mitigation, etc.) and in some projects creating protected areas (including nature reserves) or in the development of \"departmental career paths\" for the operation of conglomerates.\n\nFrench jurisprudence confirms that it is not creating an inventory for measuring regulatory protection and does not prohibit planning. However, it must be included in all the accompanying planning documents\n\n\n\n"}
