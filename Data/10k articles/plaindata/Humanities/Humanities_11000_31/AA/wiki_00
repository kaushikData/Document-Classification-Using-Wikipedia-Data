Verrius Flaccus is quoted by Aulus Gellius as stating that the etymology of \"history\" (from Greek , \"historein\", equated with Latin , \"to inquire in person\") properly restricts it to primary sources such as Thucydides's which have come from the author's own observations, while annals record the events of earlier times arranged according to years. White distinguishes annals from chronicles, which organize their events by topics such as the reigns of kings, and from histories, which aim to present and conclude a narrative implying the moral importance of the events recorded. Generally speaking, annalists record events drily, leaving the entries unexplained and equally weighted.\n\nThe chief sources of information in regard to the annals of ancient Rome are two passages in Cicero and in Servius which have been the subject of much discussion. Cicero states that, from the founding of the Republic down to the pontificate of Publius Mucius Scaevola ( ), it was usual for the pontifex maximus to record the name of the magistrates and the noteworthy events of each year on a white tablet (an ), which was exhibited in an open place at his house so that the people might read it. Servius states the events were written for each day. In the late Republic, these were known as the . After the pontificate of Publius, annals were compiled by various unofficial writers, of whom Cicero names Cato, Pictor, and Piso. These annals have been generally regarded as the same with the cited by Livy, but there seems reason to believe that the two were distinct, with the being fuller and more circumstantial. Verrius Flaccus's division of genres is borne out in the common division of Tacitus's works into \"Annals\" and \"Histories\", although he did not use those titles to refer to his own works.\n\nAmong the early Christians, it was common to establish the date of Easter by asking local Jews for the date of Passover (Nisan 14 in the Jewish calendar) and either using that date or the nearest Sunday to it. By the end of the 3rd century, this date sometimes occurred before the spring equinox and frequently varied from city to city. Following the 325 Council of Nicaea, Easter tables began to be drawn up according to various methods of computing Easter, often running from the Passion until decades or centuries into the future. Beginning in Ireland, Wales, and England in the 7th century, monks began to briefly note important events of the year as marginalia in these tables. Thereafter the compilation of annals became by and large a monastic activity, with the earliest recorded monastic annals being compiled in Ireland and known as the \"Chronicle of Ireland\". Not all early annalistic texts, however, were monastic, and some in fact were made under royal patronage. For example, what is now called the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", a text concerned mainly with the activities of kings, was written in annalistic form. Other examples of insular annals, written under various kinds of patronage, include the \"Annals of the Four Masters\", the \"Annals of Ulster\", the \"Annals of Innisfallen\", and the \"Annals of Wales\" ().\n\nIntroduced by insular missionaries to the continent, these texts were recopied, augmented, and continued, especially in Austrasia. During the 9th-century Carolingian Renaissance, they became the usual form of contemporary history: major examples include the \"Royal Frankish Annals\", the \"Annals of Fulda\" (), the \"Annals of St Bertin\" (), and the \"Annals of Lorsch\" (). As the annals developed into fuller and more descriptive entries, they became more indistinguishable from chronicles, although the term was still used for various works, such as the Annals of Waverley.\n\nIn modern literature, the term \"annals\" is similarly loosely applied to works which more or less strictly adhere to the order of years, both in western contexts (English \"Annual Registers\", French , German ) and to equivalent styles in other cultures (such as the Chinese Spring and Autumn Annals).\n\nIt is also applied to various periodicals, particularly peer-reviewed journals in the sciences, after the model of Lavoisier's \"Annales de chimie et de physique\".\n\n\n\n\nAttribution:\n"}

She lived with her father, Henry Bulling (1858–1940), a banker, and her mother, Anna Umbsen (1867–1955). In 1927, she had a short-lived marriage to a farmer that was soon declared invalid. After her failed first marriage, Bulling went off to study Art History and Chinese Studies in Berlin at Friedrich Wilhelm University (now Humboldt University of Berlin) under Erich Haenisch and Brinkmann.\n\nIn 1935 she graduated with a degree in Chinese Architecture, and in the same year emigrated to London with her partner, the Jewish architect Erwin Gutkind.\n\nIn 1946 she found work as a research scholar at the Universities China Committee and then in 1947 in Cambridge at Newnham College, where she received a PhD, the subject of her dissertation being \"Representational Art in the Han Period\".\n\nBulling's research focus was Chinese art history, especially architecture and arts and crafts. She developed a theory that the Chinese characters are the result of prehistoric (Neolithic) astronomical calendar symbols.\n\nIn 1956, Bulling and Gutkind married and emigrated to the United States for his professorship at the University of Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1964 she joined Dr. Stackler's translation project, translating many Chinese books, and in 1966 she was promoted to Research Associate for Chinese Art and Archaeology at Columbia University in New York.\n\nHer husband died in 1968.\n\nBulling died in 2004 at the age of 103 years.

Even when no such contradictions occur, such material may sometimes be deemed apocrypha if it has been produced independently of the universe's creator. For example, Buffyverse creator Joss Whedon has little involvement with Buffyverse novels, has never closely overseen or edited one, and has never read an entire novel through.\n\nStar Trek canon consists of the Star Trek television series and movies.

{"id": "15211540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15211540", "title": "Bunleua Sulilat", "text": "Bunleua Sulilat\n\nBunleua Sulilat (June 7, 1932 – August 10, 1996, often referred to as Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat, , numerous variants of the spelling exist in Western languages: see below) was a Thai/Isan/Lao mystic, myth-maker, spiritual cult leader and sculpture artist. He is responsible for creating two religious-themed parks featuring giant fantastic sculptures made of concrete on the banks of the Mekong river near Thai-Lao border: Buddha Park (Lao: ວັດຊຽງຄວນ, Thai: วัดเซียงควน) on the Lao side (25 km southeast from Vientiane), and Sala Keoku (Thai: ศาลาแก้วกู่) on the Thai side (3 km east of Nong Khai).\n\nBunleua Sulilat was born in 1932 as the seventh of eight children to a family in Nong Khai province, Thailand. According to a legend, as a young man, he fell into a cave and thus met hermit Keoku, his spiritual mentor, after whom Sala Keoku (The Hall of Keoku) is named.\nUpon graduating from his apprenticeship with Keoku, Sulilat took on monumental sculpting, and proceeded with the construction (in 1958) of his first concrete sculpture garden, Buddha Park near Vientiane, Laos. Concerned about the political climate in Laos after the 1975 communist revolution, Sulilat crossed Mekong fleeing to Thailand. In 1978, he commenced the construction of a new sculpture garden, Sala Keoku, located across the river from the old one.\n\nSulilat's eccentric and captivating personality and the blend of Buddhism and Hinduism he professed proved to hold great appeal to some of the locals, and Sala Keoku became something of a religious sect headquarters. The title Luang Pu (usually reserved for monks) came to be applied to Sulilat, who was technically a secular man. Both of the parks were constructed from donated concrete by hundreds of unskilled enthusiasts working without payment. Some other residents of the area considered Sulilat to be insane.\n\nIn his later years, Sulilat suffered a fall from one of his giant sculptures. Subsequently, his health deteriorated (the precise relation of his illness to the fall is unclear; he appears to have suffered from some blood disease), and he died in 1996. His mummified body has been enshrined at the 3rd floor of the Sala Keoku pavilion building.\n\nSulilat's sculpture gardens rely upon the rich religious art tradition of the region. What sets them apart is the uncommonly large physical dimensions (made possible through the use of modern construction materials), highly individualized (and even quirky) artistic fantasy, and sporadic contemporary references (motorized vehicles, firearms, Western garments).\n\nHaving been erected by unskilled workforce, the gardens present fine specimens of \"art naïf\" and \"art brut\", and they certainly do possess the characteristic childish spontaneity and sense of wonder. (Sulilat claimed not to have had any artistic experience prior to the construction of Buddha Park.) Yet, once again, the monumental scale of the projects and the long-term, communal, organized nature of construction are quite remarkable for the realm of outsider art.\n\nReportedly, concrete has been chosen by Sulilat as the cheapest and most accessible material for his artwork. A large number of cement factories exist on the Lao side of Mekong. The statues have been designed by Sulilat himself, and subsequently built using (mostly) unpainted concrete reinforced with metal. Larger installations rely upon brick support structures in the interior.\nSome parallels may be found between Sulilat's parks and the large-scale culture projects by Lek Viriyaphant, in particular, the fantastic woodcarving compositions of the Sanctuary of Truth. However, the latter have been designed and implemented on another financial scale with a large input of professional labor. So, compared to Sulilat's heritage, a very different balance between skilled finesse and immediate individual artistic expression is maintained in those projects. (Wat Rong Khun is another example of a contemporary unconventional Thai Buddhist art site.)\n\nThe didactic nature of Sulilat's vision found its most detailed expression in depictions of the karmic Wheel of Life present in the both of his gardens. The version in Sala Keoku is the more elaborate of the two. Mixing traditional and contemporary figures arranged in a circular pattern, it reveals the human progression from birth to death, which returns to its own origin. The composition culminates as a young man takes a step across the fence enclosing the entire installation to become a Buddha statue on the other side.\n\nDue to the lack of standard romanization scheme for Thai and Lao, there is a profusion of different spellings for Bunleua Sulilat's name, as well as the names of his parks, to the extent that makes all of them virtually impossible to account for.\n\nThus, Sulilat's first name has been spelled as Bunleua, Bounleua, Bun Leua, Boun Leua, Boon Leua, Bounlua, Bounlour, Boonlour, Bunluea, etc.\n\nHis last name has been spelled as Sulilat, Surirat, Soulilat, Sourirat, Sureerat, Su Ree Rat, etc.\n\nThe title Luang Pu has also been spelled as Luang Puu, Luang Pa, Louang Pou, Loungpou, etc.\n\nBuddha Park is also known as Wat Xiengkhouane, Wat Xieng Khouan, Wat Xiengkhuan, Wat Xieng Khuan, Vat Xiengkhuane, etc.\n\nSala Keoku has also been referred to as Sala Keo Ku, Sala Keo Koo, Sala Keo Kou, Sala Kaew Ku, Sala Kaew Koo, Salakaewkoo, Sala Gaew Goo, Sala Kaeoku, Sala Kaeo Ku, etc. It is also known as Wat Khaek.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23777713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23777713", "title": "Consolatio", "text": "Consolatio\n\nThe Consolatio or consolatory oration is a type of ceremonial oratory, typically used rhetorically to comfort mourners at funerals. It was one of the most popular classical rhetoric topics, and received new impetus under Renaissance humanism.\n\nThe \"Consolatio\" literary tradition (\"consolation\" in English) is a broad literary genre encompassing various forms of consolatory speeches, essays, poems, and personal letters. This literary tradition flourished in antiquity, and its origins date back to the fifth century BC. Orators in antiquity often delivered consolatory speeches to comfort mourners at funerals or in cases of public mourning. Friends wrote personal letters consoling each other on the loss of a loved one. These were often highly personal and emotional. In addition to personal offerings of solace, \"Consolatio\" works also include philosophical treatises on grief. These works are usually more detached in tone, and many are written in essay format. Many ancient poets even wrote verse in this distinct \"Consolatio\" style. These consolatory works are all called \"Consolatio\" because of their similar arguments, topoi, and distinctive rhetorical appeals. Only fragments of early \"Consolatio\" works survive, and it is not until Cicero's \"Tusculan Disputations\", Seneca's \"Ad Marciam\", and Boethius' \"Consolation of Philosophy\" that a unified character appears. Scholars often view these works as the bedrock of the formal \"Consolatio\" tradition. (Fournier, introduction)\n\nAll \"Consolatio\" works draw from a relatively narrow range of arguments aimed at offering solace, to allay the distress caused by the death of a loved one, a matter of ill \"fortuna\". The conventional opening of a \"Consolatio\" was \"All must die\". The most typical arguments characterizing the \"Consolatio\" genre were: \n\"All must die; even the oldest must die; the youngest too must die, and this is as one with the death of the old.\"\n\nIn the post-classical period, an additional Christian consolation was developed. \"Consolatio\" works are united by their treatment of bereavement, by unique rhetorical structure and topoi, and by their use of universal themes to offer solace.\n\nSome scholars claim the genre arose from the Sophist belief in the healing power of discourse. Others believe it arose as a response to passages of grief found in the works of the Greek poet Homer.\n\nAlthough several ancient writings contain elements of the \"Consolatio tradition\", it was the Academic Crantor of Soli (c. 325- c. 275BC), a member of Plato’s Academy, who first constructed his works in a distinct \"Consolatio\" Tradition. Although only fragments of his essays have survived, his influence is noted in the works of later writers, particularly Cicero’s \"Tusculan Disputations\" and Plutarch’s \"Consolation to Apollonius\". Crantor advocated metriopatheia, a tactic for dealing with strong emotions. Cicero’s \"Consolatio\" is widely accepted as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier \"Consolatio\" literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic.\n\nIn the Early Imperial Age, most \"Consolatio\" works were constructed within the framework of Stoicism. Seneca the Younger produced the most recognizable examples of \"Consolatio\" in his three Consolations, \"Ad Marciam\", \"Ad Polybium\", and \"Ad Helviam Matrem\". The most recognizable example of \"Consolatio\" in verse form was written by the pseudo-Ovidian, Consolatio ad Liviam. In Boethius’ \"Consolation of Philosophy\", Philosophy herself consoles the author in his sore straits.\n\nOther notable examples of the \"Consolatio\" tradition from Antiquity: Pontus 4.11 in Ovid's \"Letters from the Black Sea\", Statius’ poem consoling Abascantus on his wife’s death, Apollonius of Tyana, the Emperor Julian, and Libanius. Libanius was also the author of the funeral orations consoling mourners after the death of the Emperor Julian. The Plutarchian Corpus includes three works constructed in the \"Consolatio\" tradition: \"De exilio\", \"Consolatio ad uxorem\", \"Consolatio ad Apollonium\".\n\nThe \"Consolatio\" genre, particularly its distinct tone and topoi, widely influenced other literary genres. Elements of the \"Consolatio\" tradition can be found in a plethora of later works, and the tradition continued through the Middle Ages and into the early modern era.\n\nIn the Middle Ages Christian ideology taught that the distress, and death itself, were punishments for Adam's fall, while conceding that the tribulations of life could be vehicles of divine correction.\n\nA return to the ancient view commenced with Petrarch, though the Quatrtrocento humanist Coluccio Salutati could only offer the solace of friendships and a sense of duty. The 'art of mourning' 's general revival was expressed in many consolatory letters that circulated in manuscript and were soon printed. Among them Gianozzo Manetti's \"bitter dialogue\" \"Antonini, dilectissimi filii sui, morte consolatorius\" (1438) took the new inimate view of grieving, and Francesco Filelfo offered an extensive compendium of Christian and Classical consolations in his consolatory oration for Antonio Marcello on the death of his son (1461). Marilyn Aronberg Lavin reads Piero della Francesca's gnomic \"Flagellation of Christ\" (\"c\" 1455-60) as a \"consolatio\" of two friends (portrayed) who had each recently lost a son. \nLaurence Sterne parodied \"Consolatio\" and solemn authors in his comic novel \"Tristram Shandy\".\n\n"}

The name often reflects an urban legend that the sound of a baby can be, or has been, heard from the bridge. Many are also accompanied by an urban legend relating to a baby or young child/children.\n\nThere is an alleged \"Crybaby\" bridge in Blackstone, Virginia. The story goes that some children died around the bridge (accounts vary as to whether their death was accidental or intentional), and that at night their cries can be heard and a woman can be seen walking along the edge of the woods. Other phenomena reported include footsteps and the feeling of an 'evil presence.' It is also alleged that if a car is stopped on the bridge and baby powder is poured on the hood, baby footprints may appear in the powder.\n\nOne of many purported crybaby bridges is located near Doylestown, Ohio, in an area known as Rogue's Hollow. This bridge is located on Galehouse Road, between Rogue Hollow Road and Hametown Road. The bridge spans Silver Creek. Deep in Rogue's Hollow, this road previously led from the bottom of the hollow (Hametown Rd.) to the top (Rogue Hollow Rd.). The bridge is only approachable from Hametown Rd. from October to May, as the steeper portion of the road is seasonally closed to prevent accidents. The bridge is property of the Rogue's Hollow historical society, which also owns the adjacent Chidester Mill.\n\nRogue's Hollow Historical Society\n\"\"Map to the Mill\" link refers to the bridge; road and creek are visible in \"Chidester Hill\" photo.\"\n\nMap: \n\nMaud Hughes Road is located in Liberty Township, Butler County, Ohio. It is reputed to have been the site of many terrible accidents and suicides. Railroad tracks lie 25 feet below the bridge, and at least 36 people are said to have been reported dead on or around the Maud Hughes Road Bridge. Ghostly figures, mists, and lights have been reported, as well as black hooded figures and a phantom train. The legend says that a car carrying a man and a woman stalled on top of the bridge. The man got out to get help while the girl stayed. When the man returned, the girl was hanging on the bridge above the tracks. The man then supposedly perished with unexplained causes. To this day, many people have reported hearing the ghosts' conversations, then a woman's scream followed by a man's scream. A second story is that a woman was being chased down the road and when she got to the bridge she did not know the area and thought that there was a river underneath, so she jumped over the bridge and when she saw the train tracks screamed all the way down to her death. They say that to this day on certain nights you can still hear her screaming. Another popular and typical Crybaby Bridge story says that a woman once threw her baby off the bridge and hanged herself afterwards.\nMap: \n\nAlthough the bridge is off of Egypt Road near Salem, Ohio, it is actually on what used to be West Pine Lake Rd., which now dead-ends to the east of the bridge. Legends attribute the crying baby to one that fell in and accidentally drowned. There is also a rumor that there is a cult of some sort in the woods surrounding the bridge. In 2010, there was a murder of an elderly woman that was found, strangled to death and burned just off the bridge. The closed road remains as an access way to high-voltage utility lines. The \"baby cries\" have been said to be heard at night or during the day.\n\nMap: \n\nThis crybaby bridge is in the area of the melon heads. The bridge is on Wisner Road in Chardon Township, Geauga County, Ohio, just north of Kirtland Chardon Rd. A large section of the road is permanently closed; the bridge lies just before the south end of the closed section.\n\nThe bridge as well as the melon head homestead is torn down now, as of 2013 in an attempt to keep the melon heads from leaving the area. . The ancient sandstone bridge abutments still remain and local residents report the howling has only become louder in recent years.\n\nIn Alderson, near McAlester, the bridge is located at the end of Alderson Road and has been known to legends of a woman who was raped by her father several times and would throw her unwanted infants off the bridge. Local residents have reported sounds of babies crying underneath the bridge late at night and the appearance of a glowing woman floating over the rocky bed of North Boggy Creek.\n\nIn Moore, approximately 2 miles east of Sooner Rd. on 134th St. there is a collapsed and abandoned bridge. Legend of a woman and infant in their vehicle falling through the wood of the bridge during late-night hours, a few days later the vehicle and remains were discovered by law enforcement patrolling the area. The bridge was never repaired and the road was deemed unsafe and was closed off to vehicles. The cry of the baby is said to be heard at night.\n\nBetween Moore and Norman, on S. Douglas Blvd just south of 149th Street is a wooden bridge. It is at least as old as the school house sitting next to it. Strange moving objects have been reported there late at night.\n\nIn Kellyville, approximately 1.63 miles east of the Slick/Kellyville Road on West 181st Street on the north side, there is the original bridge abutments off of the new road. There is a local legend about a woman and her infant child driving down the road trying to escape her husband, only for the woman's car to run off the bridge. Legend has it that the baby was never found, and that if the bridge is visited at midnight the baby's cry can be heard and sometimes accompanied by a strange blue light.\nIn Oklahoma City at Lake Overholser, the metal bridge by Route 66 is known for sightings of a woman in all white with a baby on the bridge or on the side. At night her shadow allegedly appears if cars turn their lights off, and, additionally, walkers on the bridge have also allegedly reported feeling her presence and hearing a baby cry.\n\nThere is a purported \"Crybaby Bridge\" off Beaver Dam Road in Beltsville, near the Department of Agriculture's Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. It is in or near the areas where the legendary goatman has reported to have been seen.\n\nThere is another on Governor's Bridge Road, in Bowie. This bridge is a late-19th- to early-20th-century steel truss bridge; legend states that a woman and her baby were murdered in the 1930s. It is also said that in the early 20th century, a young woman was impregnated, but not married. In order to avoid judgment by family and peers, she drowned her baby in the river. Purportedly, if one parks one's car at or near this bridge, a baby can be heard crying; sometimes a ghost car will creep up from behind, but disappear when the driver or passenger turns around to see it.\n\nIn \"Weird Maryland: Your Travel Guide to Maryland's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets\", authors Matt Lake, Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman include three first-person narratives of crybaby bridge experiences in Maryland. The locations mentioned are the Governor's Bridge Road bridge discussed above, one on Lottsford Vista Road and a third unspecified, but possibly described the Lottsford Vista Road bridge as well. The latter narratives make mention of purported Satanic churches near the bridge and appearance of the Goatman.\n\nAnother Crybaby Bridge is located in Westminster, MD on Adams Mill Rd. The local legends attributed to this particular bridge range from a young woman who became pregnant and was afraid to tell her family to the location being used by the KKK to drown black babies in the 1800s.\n\nThere is also a Crybaby Bridge in Millington, Maryland on Walnut Tree Road. Many travelers mistakenly refer to this bridge as the \"Smyrna Crybaby Bridge\", due to its proximity to Smyrna, Delaware. Another is located in Gaithersburg off Game Preserve Rd under a one lane bridge.\n\nThere is a \"Crybaby Bridge\" on High Shoals Rd, just south of Anderson, South Carolina. The bridge in South Carolina was built in Virginia in 1919, brought to Charleston, South Carolina to connect two counties together. In 1952 it was brought to Anderson, South Carolina. replaced the older bridge that had been there. It is about 194 feet long and about 17 feet wide. Shortly later locals called it Cry Baby Bridge. \n\nAn old Grist mill sat below the bridge along the Rocky River in 1840, and ran until about 1900s. \n\nIn 1894 an electrical plant was built there by W. C. Whitner. It gave the Anderson County the nickname The Electric City. One of the generators from the electric mill is still on display in Anderson County. \nThe bridge has many changes through the times, from no bridge, to wooden bridge, to the well known Iron Railed Bridge called Cry Baby Bridge to now modern cement bridge that now runs beside Cry Baby Bridge, it still remains a part of Anderson County's history and a famous landmark. \n\nA popular destination for paranormal enthusiasts just south of Pageland, South Carolina is one of the oldest \"cry baby\" bridges. Locally known as \"Cry Baby Creek\", the bridge spanning Flat Creek has been closed off to auto traffic since the late 50's, but is accessible by foot via a short walk through what is now a nature reserve. The story of Cry Baby Creek tells of a young mother who loses her baby in the slow moving waters after a late night accident on the bridge. Unlike the most other crybaby legends, the sounds coming from the creek are not limited to hearing a baby cry while standing on the bridge; many legends refer to witnesses actually seeing the mother search for her baby up and down the creek. \n\nMap: \n\n\"Crybaby Bridge\", or \"Spook Bridge\", located over Houston, Texas, runs across county road 4130, located 4 miles south of De Kalb, Texas. The old legend says that a woman and her triplets were rushing home late one night to prepare dinner for her husband that was soon to be home. As they approached the bridge the woman lost control of the car, causing it to ramp off the side of the old wooden bridge, killing the mother and her triplets. There are many stories of encounters with the spirits of the victims. Locals claim that late at night if you shut your vehicle engine off, kill your lights, and honk 3 times you will be able to hear the cries of the long dead triplets. There have been a few claims to have captured photographs of the disturbed spirit of the mother or as some call her the clay lady (due to the amount of clay under the bridge at one point of time), while others claim to have captured orb like lights that were not there before the photographs were taken. There are also claims of a strange white light that lingers around the area of the bridge, which unexpectedly comes out of nowhere and is gone in a blink of an eye. The witnesses of these events range from young teenagers to elderly men and women. If you ask a long time resident of De Kalb, Texas about cry baby bridge you are almost guaranteed a scary story. Some of these stories are not quite popular and are hard to find on the internet, mainly because they are not openly shared due to peoples' belief that they will be mocked for sharing their experiences at the bridge.\n\nJack Creek, a stream west of Lufkin, Texas, has for years been known as Cry Baby Creek, supposedly because a woman and a baby died when their auto veered off a wooden bridge and fell into the steep creek. Annette Sawyer of Lufkin said visitors who come to the site at night claim they have heard sounds resembling a baby crying. One visitor supposedly found the imprint of a baby’s hand on her auto window after returning from the bridge.\n\n\"Sarah Jane Bridge\" on East Port Neches Avenue in Port Neches, Texas is said to be the bridge from which a baby of the same name was thrown into the alligator-infested water by a man who had murdered the child's mother. It is said Sarah Jane can be heard crying from the water when one stands on the bridge on hot summer nights. The child's mother, a headless ghost wandering the woods nearby, can also be heard whispering \"Sarah Jane\" as she searches the forest with a lantern. The legendary Sarah Jane is Sarah Jane Block, who lost no children and lived to the age of 99.\n\nLocals from the small town of Bear River City, Utah claim that many years ago a mother drove off the bridge with her two children in the car, killing all three of them. It is said that honking the horn three times will elicit a response from the ghostly children. Some claim to have heard a child's voice saying \"Don't do it, Mother!\"\n\nIn 1999, Maryland folklorist Jesse Glass presented a case against several crybaby bridges being genuine folklore, contending that they were instead fakelore that was knowingly being propagated through the internet.\n\nAccording to Glass, nearly identical stories of crybaby bridges in Maryland and Ohio began to appear online in 1999, but they could not be confirmed through local oral history or the media.\n\nAmong Glass' examples was the story of a bridge located in Westminster, Maryland, which concerned the murder of escaped slaves and African American children. It's located specifically on Rockland Road, just off of Uniontown Road outside of Westminster's city limits past Rt. 31. In the 1800s the story held, unwanted black babies were drowned by being thrown off this bridge. Regional newspapers, such as the \"American Sentinel\" and the \"Democratic Advocate\", which usually covered racially motivated murders of the period, make no mention of the events described online.\n\nHowever, in their book \"Weird U.S.: Your Travel Guide to America's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets\", authors Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman relate the story of a purported crybaby bridge on Lottsford Vista Road between Bowie and Upper Marlboro, asserting that this bridge has \"made believers out of many skeptics.\" The text included from their informant makes no mention of escaped slaves but does repeat a familiar component of such legends: an out-of-wedlock birth.\n\n"}

It involves annotation, publication and presentation of the data such that the value of the data is maintained over time, and the data remains available for reuse and preservation. Data curation includes \"all the processes needed for principled and controlled data creation, maintenance, and management, together with the capacity to add value to data\". In science, data curation may indicate the process of extraction of important information from scientific texts, such as research articles by experts, to be converted into an electronic format, such as an entry of a biological database.\n\nIn the modern era of big data the curation of data has become more prominent, particularly for software processing high volume and complex data systems. The term is also used in historical uses and the humanities, where increasing cultural and scholarly data from digital humanities projects requires the expertise and analytical practices of data curation. In broad terms, curation means a range of activities and processes done to create, manage, maintain, and validate a component. Specifically, data curation is the attempt to determine what information is worth saving and for how long.\n\nThe user, rather than the database itself, typically initiates data curation and maintains metadata. According to the University of Illinois' Graduate School of Library and Information Science, \"Data curation is the active and on-going management of data through its lifecycle of interest and usefulness to scholarship, science, and education; curation activities enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality, add value, and provide for re-use over time.\" The data curation workflow is distinct from data quality management, data protection, lifecycle management and data movement.\n\nCensus data has been available in tabulated punch card form since the early 20th century and has been electronic since the 1960s. The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) web site marks 1962 as the date of their first Survey Data Archive.\n\nDeep background on data libraries appeared in a 1982 issue of the Illinois journal, \"Library Trends.\" For historical background on the data archive movement, see \"Social Scientific Information Needs for Numeric Data: The Evolution of the International Data Archive Infrastructure.\" The exact curation process undertaken within any organisation depends on the volume of data, how much noise the data contains and what the expected future use of the data means to its dissemination.\n\nThe crises in space data led to the 1999 creation of the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) model, stewarded by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), which was formed in 1982.\n\nThe term data curation is sometimes used in the context of biological databases, where specific biological information is firstly obtained from a range of research articles and then stored within a specific category of database. For instance, information about anti-depressant drugs can be obtained from various sources and, after checking whether they are available as a database or not, they are saved under a drug's database's anti-depressive category. Enterprises are also utilizing data curation within their operational and strategic processes to ensure data quality and accuracy.\n\nThe Dissemination Information Packages (DIPS) for Information Reuse (DIPIR) project is studying research data produced and used by quantitative social scientists, archaeologists, and zoologists. The intended audience is researchers who use secondary data and the digital curators, digital repository managers, data center staff, and others who collect, manage, and store digital information.\n\nThe Protein Data Bank was established in 1971 at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and has grown into a global project. A database for three-dimensional structural data of proteins and other large biological molecules, the PDB contains over 120,000 structures, all standardized, validated against experimental data, and annotated.\n\nFlyBase, the primary repository of genetic and molecular data for the insect family \"Drosophilidae\", dates back to 1992. FlyBase annotates the entire \"Drosophila melanogaster\" genome.\n\nThe Linguistic Data Consortium is a data repository for linguistic data, dating back to 1992.\n\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey began surveying the night sky in 2000.

Proponents describe it as an alternative to multiculturalism that would attempt to prevent cultural assimilation and cultural homogenization. The movement is closely associated with the \"Nouvelle Droite\" and French academic Alain de Benoist.\n\nEthnopluralism has been proposed by some in the radical right as a means to facilitate nationalism. Implementing this policy would require ethnic cleansing to establish separate territories for different ethnic groups.\n\nEthnopluralism emphasizes the separation of varying ethnic and cultural groups, in contrast to cultural integration and intra-cultural diversity. It has been part of the ideological foundation of the European New Right, which has used ethnopluralism to express its favoritism towards the cultural identity of individual groups, thus expressing its opposition to heterogeneity within states. These views of culture, ethnicity and race have become popular among several right-wing and far-right groups in Europe since the 1970s, and has been covered in some postmodern left sources (i.e. \"Telos\") also.\n\nEthnopluralists use the concept of cultural differentialism to assert a \"right to difference\" to propose regional policies of ethnic and racial separatism. Among ethnopluralists there is no agreed upon definition of group membership, nor where these hypothetical borders would lie. Some ethnopluralists advocate limiting Europe to \"true Europeans\", while others propose much smaller divisions, similar to an ethnically-based communitarianism. While some ethnopluralists would allow European Muslims to remain in Europe, Jews and Romani are typically rejected by ethnopluralists. French Nouvelle Droite philosopher Alain de Benoist claims that indigenous cultures in Europe are being threatened, and that pan-European nationalism based on ethnopluralism would stop this process. Benoist has proposed ethnic and social territories be as small as possible, such that Muslims would be allowed ghettos in Europe subordinate to sharia.\n\nAccording to ethnomusicologist Benjamin R. Teitelbaum, the term \"ethnopluralism\" was first coined by German sociologist Henning Eichberg in an essay that was written in opposition to both Western and European eurocentrism.\n"}

It is really two cultures, the Fatyanovo in the west, the Balanovo in the east. The Fatyanovo culture emerged at the northeastern edge of the Middle Dnieper culture, and probably was derived from an early variant of the Middle Dnieper culture. \n\nFatyanovo migrations correspond to regions with hydronyms of a Baltic language dialect mapped by linguists as far as the Oka river and the upper Volga. Spreading eastward down the Volga they discovered the copper ores of the western Ural foothills, and started long term settlements in lower Kama river region. The Balanovo culture occupied the region of the Kama–Vyatka–Vetluga interfluves where metal resources (local copper sandstone deposits) of the region were exploited.\n\nFatyanovo ceramics show mixed Corded Ware / Globular Amphorae traits. The later Abashevo culture pottery looked somewhat like Fatyanovo-Balanovo Corded Ware, but Abashevo kurgans were unlike Fatyanovo flat cemeteries, although flat graves were a recognizable component of the Abashevo burial rite. Balanovo burials (like the Middle Dnieper culture) were both of the flat and kurgan type, containing individual and also mass graves.\n\nSettlements are scant, and bear evidence of a degree of fortification. The villages were usually situated on the high hills of the riverbanks, consisting of several above-ground houses built from wooden logs with saddle roofs, and also joined by passages. The economy seems to be quite mobile, but then we are cautioned that domestic swine are found, which suggests something other than a mobile society. The Fatyanovo culture is viewed as introducing an economy based on domestic livestock (sheep, cattle, horse & dog) into the forest zone of Russia. The Balanovo also used draught cattle and two wheeled wagons.\n\nAs is usual with such ancient cultures, our main knowledge comes from their inhumations. Shaft graves were evident, which might be lined with wood. The deceased were wrapped in animal skins or birch bark and placed into wooden burial chambers in subterranean rectangular pits. The interments are otherwise in accord with Corded Ware practices, with males resting on their right side and females on their left. Local metal objects of a Central European provenance type were present. Copper ornaments and tools have been found in Balanovo burials (Chalcolithic). Burial goods depended on sex, age, and social position. Copper axes primarily accompanied persons of high social position, stone axe-hammers were given to men, flint axes to children and women. Amulets are frequently found in the graves as well as metal working implements.\n\nThe theory for an intrusive culture is based upon the physical type of the population (physical anthropology), flexed burial under barrows, the presence of battle-axes and ceramics. There are similarities between Fatyanovo and Catacomb culture stone battle-axes. The Volosovo culture of indigenous forest foragers was different in its ceramics, economy, and mortuary practices. It dispersed when the Fatyanovo people pushed into the Upper and Middle Volga basin. Ceramic finds indicate Balanovo coexisted with the Volosovo people (mixed Balanovo-Volosovo sites), and also displaced them. Note that the ethnic and linguistic attribution of the Volosovo culture is uncertain; Häkkinen maintains that their language was neither Uralic nor Indo-European, but a substratum to Finno-Permic. The cultures of the Prikamsky subarea in the Late Bronze Age continued preceding traditions in pottery, house designs, and stable animal husbandry with the breeding of horse, cattle, and to a lesser extent, pigs and sheep. Scholars interpret some of these cultures with stages in the development of the proto-Permian language. Some have argued that this culture represents the acculturation of Pit-Comb Ware culture people of this area from contacts with Corded Ware agriculturists in the West. It does not seem to represent a northern extension of the Indo-European Yamna culture horizon further south.\n\nHistorical sources mention a people inhabiting the region of the earlier Fatyanovo region. The Hypatian Codex of Chronicles mentions that in 1147 the Prince of Rostov-Suzdal defeated the Golyad' (Голядь) who lived by the River Porotva. The Protva is a tributary of the Oka river near Moscow, where there is a wealth of Baltic hydronyms.\n\n\n"}

Similarly, other topics such as euthanasia, contraception and same-sex marriage are sometimes discussed in terms of an individual right of \"freedom of choice.\" Some social issues, for example the New York \"Soda Ban\" have been both defended and opposed with reference to \"freedom of choice.\"\n\nIn microeconomics, freedom of choice is the freedom of economic agents to allocate their resources as they see fit, among the options (such as goods, services, or assets) that are available to them. It includes the freedom to engage in employment available to them.\n\nRatner et al., in 2008, cited the literature on libertarian paternalism which states that consumers do not always act in their own best interests. They attribute this phenomenon to factors such as emotion, cognitive limitations and biases, and incomplete information which they state may be remedied by various proposed interventions. They discuss providing consumers with information and decision tools, organizing and restricting their market options, and tapping emotions and managing expectations. Each of these, they state, could improve consumers' ability to choose.\n\nHowever, economic freedom to choose ultimately depends upon market competition, since buyers' available options are usually the result of various factors controlled by sellers, such as overall quality of a product or a service and advertisement. In the event that a monopoly exists, the consumer no longer has the freedom to choose to buy from a different producer. As Friedrich Hayek pointed out:\nAs shown in the above quote, libertarian thinkers are often strong advocates for increasing freedom of choice. One example of this is Milton Friedman's \"Free to Choose\" book and TV series.\n\nThere is no consensus as to whether an increase in economic freedom of choice leads to an increase in happiness. In one study, the Heritage Foundation's 2011 Index of Economic Freedom report showed a strong correlation between its Index of Economic Freedom and happiness in a country.\n\nThe axiomatic-deductive approach has been used to address the issue of measuring the amount of freedom of choice (FoC) an individual enjoys. In a 1990 paper, Prasanta K. Pattanaik and Yongsheng Xu presented three conditions that a measurement of FoC should satisfy:\nThey proved that the cardinality is the only measurement that satisfies these axioms, what they observed to be counter-intuitive and suggestive that one or more axioms should be reformulated. They illustrated this with the example of the option set \"to travel by train\" or \"to travel by car\", that should yield more FoC than the option set \"to travel by red car\" or \"to travel by blue car\". Some suggestions have been made to solve this problem, by reformulating the axioms, usually including concepts of preferences, or rejecting the third axiom.\n\nA 2006 study by Simona Botti and Ann L. McGill showed that, when subjects were presented with differentiated options and had the freedom to choose between them, their choice enhanced their satisfaction with positive and dissatisfaction with negative outcomes, relative to nonchoosers.\n\nA 2010 study by Hazel Rose Markus and Barry Schwartz compiled a list of experiments about freedom of choice and argued that \"too much choice can produce a paralyzing uncertainty, depression, and selfishness\". Schwartz argues that people frequently experience regret due to opportunity costs for not making an optimal decision and that, in some scenarios, people's overall satisfaction are sometimes higher when a difficult decision is made by another person rather than by themselves, even when the other person's choice is worse. Schwarts had written a book and given speeches criticizing the excess of options in modern society, though acknowledging that \"some choice is better than none\".\n\n"}

{"id": "41332643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41332643", "title": "Gender paradox", "text": "Gender paradox\n\nThe gender paradox is a sociolinguistic phenomenon first observed by William Labov, in which \"Women conform more closely than men to sociolinguistic norms that are overtly prescribed, but conform less than men when they are not.\" Specifically, the \"paradox\" arises from sociolinguistic data showing that women are more likely to use prestige forms and avoid stigmatized variants than men for a majority of linguistic variables, but that they are also more likely to lead language change by using innovative forms of variables.\n\nWilliam Labov identifies three main principles that, in combination, constitute the gender paradox. They illuminate the juxtaposing roles of women, who display both conformist and nonconformist behavior in the treatment of linguistic variables.\n\nThe first of the three principles states that \"For stable sociolinguistic variables, women show a lower rate of stigmatized variants and a higher rate of prestige variants than men.\" This principle gives the most general understanding of women's treatment of linguistic variables, in that when variables are not undergoing any change, women tend to prefer the standard form of the variable to the non-standard form. It is a commonly occurring phenomenon that sociolinguists have observed in a wide array of societies. Peter Trudgill's study of the (ng) variable in Norwich, England provides evidence to support this principle.\n\nIn his 1968 study, Trudgill studied the frequency of the (ng) variable among sixty random subjects, calculating the usage of the standard form [ɪŋ] versus that of the non-standard form [ən ~ n̩]. He classified his results into categories of class, style and sex. Women tended to avoid the stigmatized form, preferring the standard form more than men did, which hold true for nearly all English dialects. Females were even more careful with their choice in variable when speaking formally, indicating a high level of linguistic awareness.\n\nOccasionally considered a corollary to the first principle, the second principle states: \"In linguistic change from above, women adopt prestige forms at a higher rate than men.\" These are language changes that individuals are generally conscious of. People are aware of the prestige associated with formal styles and thus are prone to hypercorrection – a product of linguistic insecurity. Several studies have shown that women are leaders both in eliminating stigmatized forms and adopting incoming prestige forms, and they do so at a notably higher rate than men.\n\nThis finding is widespread across languages and can be seen in examples such as (r)-pronunciation in New York City, the reversal of the Parisian French chain shift, and entire language shifts, like that from Hungarian to German in Austria.\n\nThe third principle is as follows: \"In linguistic change from below, women use higher frequencies of innovative forms more than men do.\"\n\nThese changes, which generally occur below the level of social consciousness, are \"the primary form of linguistic change that operates within the system.\" In these cases, women are the initiators and leaders of changes in progress.\n\nThe Northern Cities Shift (NCS) offers a clear example of women leading change from below. For instance, the Atlas of North American English provides data on the regression analysis of 56 speakers in the Inland North, in which the most significant factor regarding sound change advancement is gender, making women the leading innovators. Women-led sound change from below is particularly salient for new and vigorous changes, like that of the palatalization of /t/ and /d/ in Cairo Arabic.\n\nResearchers in sociolinguistics have attempted to provide a unified account and explanation for the gender paradox with varying levels of success.\n\nOne proposed explanation from J. K. Chambers is the notion that women lead sound change due to some inherent biological verbal advantage. Under this view, women command a greater range of variants and styles, despite similar gender roles, because of sex differences. This view is contradicted by the varying size of the \"gender gap,\" and the fact that differences have not remained constant over time. Labov asserts that if Chambers' biological explanation were to hold true, it would need to produce a robust effect across generations. Greater verbal ability would also predict more accurate self-representation in women. In fact, women tend to over-report usages of prestige forms, and give less accurate self-reports of language variants than men.\n\nAnother possible explanation for women's leadership in language change is their greater sensitivity to the social status associated with certain variants. As women have historically been denied access to the standard economic capital available to men through education and job opportunities, this may have motivated the usage of prestige forms to help them gain social capital and advance their social standing, both consciously for cases of change from above and subconsciously for change from below. The notion that women's speech is in fact the \"language of powerlessness\" is supported by findings that some features of stereotypical women's speech were also used by men when in a position of subverted power.\n\nHowever, this view fails to address the consistently higher use of prestige forms even in contemporary societies with high levels of gender equality. Studies of language variation in central Sweden show that gender differences in speech have been maintained or even increased since 1967, despite the fact that recent legislation in Sweden has led to widespread gender equality. Nonetheless, the legislation may be too recent to have any great effect on the power entrenched in language and the inherent sexism that might remain despite various new laws.\n\nGendered patterns of speech can also be explained by social network theory, which suggests that speech differences are accounted for by the differences between the social networks of men and women. Men tend to have denser, more local social networks, which are more conservative and resistant to change, resulting in higher usage of non-standard local variants. On the other hand, women tend to have more open, less locally-constrained networks, which are more likely to use standard variants and have access to innovative forms due to weak ties to other speech communities.\n\nIn addition to the difficulties that arise in reconciling the gender paradox itself, other complications have emerged in the methodology and interpretations that led to its discovery.\n\nThough evidence of the paradox is widespread in sociolinguistic variation studies that use either sex or gender as a variable, findings that support the principles are not universal. Most data in support of the gender paradox come from studies of Indo-European languages in Europe or North America, but studies done in Asian, African and Middle Eastern countries often show contradictory patterns. For example, male speakers use the prestigious classical variety of Arabic far more than women, even though women lead in the use of locally \"prestigious\" standard variants. Male speakers of Malagasy also lead in the use of their ideal speech style, characterized by non-confrontational indirectness, whereas the women are \"norm-breakers\" and use the stigmatized, direct style associated with negative information. These counterexamples suggest that the gender paradox could be limited to western cultures or languages.\n\nSeveral sociolinguists question the validity of making generalizations about a group as large as \"women,\" which makes up roughly half the population of the world. Penelope Eckert argues instead that women are not using prestige forms to declare whether or not they are women. A single linguistic variable can be indexical of multiple traits and women (and men) can belong to multiple social groups, each with their own linguistic traits. Language variations are chosen by their third order indexical qualities on a personal, rather than gender-wide level, reflected in the fact that no two women's speech is exactly alike. These findings challenge the idea that women's use of prestige forms is not necessarily something inherent in their biology, but could also be an external, third-order indexical quality more highly valued among women than men.\n\nSocial constructionists view the gender paradox as questionable because many of the studies used as evidence fail to take into account the sex and gender distinction. When gender is mentioned at all, it is often used synonymously with sex. While statistics support the fact that women often lead language change, the motivations for doing so cannot be determined by statistics alone. It is inconclusive whether it is something physiologically inherent that makes women more progressive in their language use, or if this trend is instead an effect of the role of the female gender within society. If a tendency towards language change is a product of gender, which is socially constructed, then sociolinguistics should instead be focusing on the social aspects of femininity that are indexed by female speech. This view would also account for the inconsistency in results between studies done in western cultures supporting the gender paradox and those done in other cultures where the results are less conclusive.\n\nVariation among women could also be due to shifting standard forms. In a 2003 study of the multilingual community of Palau, Kazuko Matsumoto and David Britain, examined the functions of prestige forms among women of various age groups. They found that among Palau women of the parent and grandparent generations, the use of Japanese is considered a conservative behavior, as it is used to preserve their ethnic home language. Among young Palau women, however, the use of Japanese is considered an innovative behavior because, having been raised speaking Palau, Japanese is an overly-prestigious foreign language used to secure a job in the modern employment market.\n\n"}

Connell's gender order theory, which recognizes multiple masculinities that vary across time, culture and the individual. Hegemonic masculinity is defined as a practice that legitimizes men's dominant position in society and justifies the subordination of women, and other marginalized ways of being a man. Conceptually, hegemonic masculinity proposes to explain how and why men maintain dominant social roles over women, and other gender identities, which are perceived as \"feminine\" in a given society.\n\nAs a sociologic concept, the nature of hegemonic masculinity derives from the theory of cultural hegemony, by Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci, which analyses the power relations among the social classes of a society. Hence, in the term \"hegemonic masculinity\", the adjective \"hegemonic\" refers to the cultural dynamics by means of which a social group claims, and sustains, a leading and dominant position in a social hierarchy; nonetheless, hegemonic masculinity embodies a form of social organization that has been sociologically challenged and changed.\n\nThe conceptual beginnings of hegemonic masculinity represented the culturally idealized form of manhood that was socially and hierarchically exclusive and concerned with bread-winning; that was anxiety-provoking and differentiated (internally and hierarchically); that was brutal and violent, pseudo-natural and tough, psychologically contradictory, and thus crisis-prone; economically rich and socially sustained.\n\nMany sociologists criticized that definition of \"hegemonic masculinity\" as a fixed character-type, which is analytically limited, because it excludes the complexity of different, and competing, forms of masculinity. Consequently, hegemonic masculinity was reformulated to include gender hierarchy, the geography of masculine configurations, the processes of social embodiment, and the psycho-social dynamics of the varieties of masculinity. Moreover, proponents argue that hegemonic masculinity is conceptually useful for understanding gender relations, and is applicable to life-span development, education, criminology, the representations of masculinity in the mass communications media, the health of men and women, and the functional structure of organizations.\n\nTerry Kupers of The Wright Institute describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity in these terms: \n\nThe concept of hegemonic masculinity was first proposed in field reports from a study of social inequality in Australian high schools; in a related conceptual discussion of the making of masculinities and the experiences of men's bodies; and in a debate over the role of men in Australian labour politics. These beginnings were organized into an article which critiqued the \"male sex role\" literature and proposed a model of multiple masculinities and power relations. This model was integrated into a systematic sociological theory of gender. The resulting six pages in \"Gender and Power\" by R. W. Connell on \"hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity\" became the most cited source for the concept of hegemonic masculinity. This concept draws its theoretical roots from the Gramscian term \"hegemony\" as it was used to understand the stabilization of class relations. The idea was then transferred to the problem of gender relations.\n\nHegemonic masculinity draws some of its historical roots from both the fields of social psychology and sociology which contributed to the literature about the male sex role that had begun to recognize the social nature of masculinity and the possibilities of change in men's conduct. This literature preceded the Women's Liberation Movement and feminist theories of patriarchy which also played a strong role in shaping the concept of hegemonic masculinity. The core concepts of power and difference were found in the gay liberation movement which had not only sought to analyse the oppression of men but also oppression by men. This idea of a hierarchy of masculinities has since persisted and strongly influenced the reformulation of the concept.\n\nEmpirical social research also played an important role as a growing body of field studies documented local gender hierarchies and local cultures of masculinities in schools, male-dominated workplaces, and village communities. Finally, the concept was influenced by psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud produced the first analytic biographies of men and showed how adult personality was a system under tension and the psychoanalyst Robert J. Stoller popularized the concept of gender identity and mapped its variation in boys' development.\n\nThe particular normative form of masculinity that is the most honoured way of being a man, which requires all other men to position themselves in relation to it, is known as hegemonic masculinity. Originally, hegemonic masculinity was understood as the pattern of practice that allowed men's dominance over women to continue. In Western society, the dominant form of masculinity or the cultural ideal of manhood was primarily reflective of white, heterosexual, largely middle-class males. The ideals of manhood espoused by the dominant masculinity suggested a number of characteristics that men are encouraged to internalize into their own personal codes and which form the basis for masculine scripts of behaviour. These characteristics include: violence and aggression, stoicism (emotional restraint), courage, toughness, physical strength, athleticism, risk-taking, adventure and thrill-seeking, competitiveness, and achievement and success. Hegemonic masculinity is not completely dominant, however, as it only exists in relation to non-hegemonic, subordinated forms of masculinity. The most salient example of this approach in contemporary European and American society is the dominance of heterosexual men and the subordination of homosexual men. This was manifested in political and cultural exclusion, legal violence, street violence, and economic discrimination. Gay masculinity was the most conspicuous subordinated masculinity during this period of time, but not the only one. Heterosexual men and boys with effeminate characteristics ran the risk of being scorned as well.\n\nHegemonic masculinity is neither normative in the numerical sense, as only a small minority of men may enact it, nor in an actual sense, as the cultural ideal of masculinity is often a fantasy figure, such as John Wayne or John Rambo. Hegemonic masculinity may not even be the commonest pattern in the everyday lives of men. Rather, hegemony can operate through the formation of exemplars of masculinity, symbols that have cultural authority despite the fact that most men and boys cannot fully live up them. Hegemonic masculinity imposes an ideal set of traits which stipulate that a man can never be unfeminine enough. Thus, fully achieving hegemonic masculinity becomes an unattainable ideal.\n\nComplicity to the aforementioned masculine characteristics was another key feature of the original framework of hegemonic masculinity. Yet still since men benefit from the patriarchal dividend, they generally gain from the overall subordination of women. However, complicity is not so easily defined as pure subordination since marriage, fatherhood, and community life often involve extensive compromises with women rather than simple domination over them. In this way hegemony is not gained through necessarily violent or forceful means, but it is achieved through culture, institutions, and persuasions.\n\nThe interplay of gender with class and race creates more extensive relationships among masculinities. For example, new information technology has redefined middle-class masculinities and working-class masculinities in different ways. In a racial context, hegemonic masculinity among whites sustains the institutional oppression and physical terror that have framed the making of masculinities in black communities. It has been suggested that historically suppressed groups like inner city African-American males exhibit the more violent standards of hegemonic masculinity in response to their own subordination and lack of control. This idea of marginalization is always relative to what is allowed by the dominant group, therefore creating subsets of hegemonic masculinity based on existing social hierarchies.\n\nAs the earliest model of this concept grew, so did the scrutiny and criticisms surrounding it. The following principal criticisms have been identified since debate about the concept began in the early 1990s.\n\nThe underlying concept of masculinity has been argued as flawed from both a realist and a poststructuralist point of view. To Hearn, the concept of masculinity is blurred, uncertain in its meaning, and tends to deemphasize issues of power and domination. To Petersen, the concept of masculinity is flawed because it reduces the character of men or imposes a false unity of a fluid and contradictory reality. The concept of masculinity is criticized for being framed within a heteronormative conception of gender that oversimplified male-female difference and ignores differences and exclusions within the gender categories. The concept of masculinity is said to rest logically on a dichotomization of sex (biological) and gender (cultural) and thus marginalizes or naturalizes the body. Brod observes that there is a tendency in men's studies field to proceed as if women were not a relevant part of the analysis and therefore to analyse masculinities by looking only at men and relations among men. Therefore, a consistently relational approach to gender is being called upon.\n\nEarly criticisms of the concept raised the question of who actually represents hegemonic masculinity. Many men who hold great social power do not embody an ideal masculinity. Martin criticizes the concept for leading to inconsistent applications sometimes referring to a fixed type and other times to whatever the dominant form is. Wetherell and Edley contend this concept fails to specify what conformity to hegemonic masculinity actually looks like in practice. Similarly Whitehead suggests there is confusion over who actually is a hegemonically masculine man. Inspired by Gramsci's differentiation between hegemony as a form of ideological consent and dominance as an expression of conflict Groes-Green has argued that when hegemonic masculinities are challenged in a society dominant masculinities are emerging based on bodily powers, such as violence and sexuality, rather than based on economic and social powers. Through examples from his fieldwork among youth in Maputo, Mozambique he shows that this change is related to social polarization, new class identities and the undermining of breadwinner roles and ideologies in a neoliberal economy.\n\nIt has also been argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity does not adequately describe a realness of power. Holter argues that the concept constructs power from the direct experience of women rather than from the structural basis of women's subordination. Holter believes in distinguishing between patriarchy and gender and argues further that it is a mistake to treat a hierarchy of masculinities constructed within gender relations as logically continuous with the patriarchal subordination of women. In response to the adverse connotations surrounding the concept, Collier remarks that hegemonic masculinity is solely associated with negative characteristics that depict men as unemotional, aggressive, independent, and non-nurturing without recognizing positive behaviours such as bringing home a wage or being a father.\n\nSeveral authors have argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity is based on an unsatisfactory theory of the subject because it does not rely enough upon discourses of masculinity. Wetherell and Edley argue that hegemonic masculinity cannot be understood as the characteristics that constitute any group of men. To Whitehead the concept fails to specify how and why some heterosexual men legitimate, reproduce, and generate their dominance and do so as a social minority since they are outnumbered by women and other men they dominate. A related criticism also derives from psychoanalysis which has criticized the lack of attention given to how men actually psychologically relate to hegemonic masculinity. For example, Laurie argues that the hegemonic masculinity framework lends itself to a modified essentialism, wherein the \"achievement of masculine goals is frequently attributed to a way of thinking understood as inherent to the male psyche, and in relation to an innate disposition for homosocial bonding\".\n\nThere is considerable evidence that hegemonic masculinity is not a self-reproducing form. Demetriou suggests this is because a kind of simplification has occurred. He identifies two forms of hegemony, internal and external. External hegemony relates to the institutionalization of men's dominance over women and internal hegemony refers to the position of one group of men over all other men. Scholars commonly do not clarify or acknowledge the relationship between the two. This suggests that subordinated and marginalized masculinities do not impact the construction of hegemonic masculinity as much as critics suggest it should.\n\nIn one of the most widely cited works analysing the concept, Connell and Messerschmidt sought to reformulate their theory of hegemonic masculinity in light of certain criticisms. They readjusted their framework to address four main areas: the nature of gender hierarchy, the geography of masculine configurations, the process of social embodiment, and the dynamics of masculinities.\n\nGender hierarchy seeks to explain not only why men hold a superior position to women but how each group influences one another. Research has documented the durability of nonhegemonic patterns of masculinity, which may represent well-crafted responses to racial/ethnic marginalization, physical disability, class inequality, or stigmatized sexuality. Hegemony may be accomplished by the incorporation of such masculinities into functioning gender order rather than by active oppression in the form of degradation or violence. An example would include that of the mainstream adoption of black hip hop culture which was created in response to urban structural inequalities. Another example is that of \"protest masculinity\", in which local working-class settings, sometimes involving ethnically marginalized men, embodies the claim to power typical of regional hegemonic masculinities in Western countries, but lack the economic resources and institutional authority that underpins the regional and global patterns.\n\nThis new emphasis on gender hierarchy seeks to take a more relational approach to women as well. Women are central in many of the processes constructing masculinities, as mothers, schoolmates, girlfriends, sexual partners, wives, and workers in the gender division of labour. Gender hierarchies are affected by new configurations of women's identity and practice so more attention has been given to the historical interplay of femininities and masculinities.\n\nChange in locally specific constructions of hegemonic masculinity has been a consistent theme of masculinity research, but given the growing attention to globalization, the significance of transnational arenas for the construction of masculinity has also been argued. Hooper described the deployment of masculinities in the arenas of international relations, and Connell proposed a model of \"transnational business masculinity\" among jet-setting corporate executives. Because of this, Connell and Messerschmidt have proposed hegemonic masculinities be analysed at three levels: local, regional, and global. The links between these levels are critical to gender politics since interventions at any level giving women more power and representation can influence from the top down or from the bottom up. Additionally, adopting a framework that distinguishes between the three levels allows one to recognize the importance of place without making generalizations about independent cultures or discourses.\n\nSocial embodiment calls for a more rigid definition of what a hegemonically masculine man is and how the idea is actually carried out in real life. The pattern of embodiment involved in hegemony has been recognized in the earliest formulations of the concept but called for more theoretical attention. The importance of masculine embodiment for identity and behaviour emerges in many contexts. For example, in youth, skill in physical activity becomes a prime indicator of masculinity. This notion continues to manifest itself into many different health and sexual practices such as eating meat or having multiple sexual partners. The emergence of transgender issues has made it particularly clear that embodiment be given more focus in reconceptualizations. The circuits of social embodiment may be very direct and simple or may be long and complex, passing through institutions, economic relations, cultural symbols, and so forth without ceasing to involve material bodies.\n\nNew theory has recognized the layering and potential internal contradictions within all practices that construct masculinities. This is a departure from a unitary masculinity and focus on compromised formations between contradictory desires or emotions. Masculinities are configurations of practice that are constructed, unfold, and change through time. One area of focus may represent that of Western fathers given the gender division of labour in child care, the \"long hours culture\" of professions and management, and the preoccupation of rich fathers with managing their wealth. While these practices may adhere to conventional Western ideas of hegemonic masculinity, this may not necessarily translate into a satisfying life experience. As gender relations evolve and women's movements grow stronger, the dynamics of masculinities may see a complete abolition of power differentials and a more equitable relationship between men and women and between men and other men. This positive hegemony remains a key strategy for contemporary efforts at reforming gender relations. Groes-Green has argued that Connell's theory of masculinities risks excluding the possibility of more gender equitable or \"philogynous\" forms of masculinity such as those he has identified in Mozambique. He urges social researchers to begin developing theories and concepts that can improve an understanding of how more positive, alternative and less dominant masculinities may develop even if these are always embedded in local gender power relations.\n\nChildren learn at an early age, mostly through educational and peer interactions, what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl, and are quick to demonstrate that they understand these roles. This notion of \"doing\" gender involves differentiating between boys and girls from the day they are born and perpetuating the discourses of gender difference. The idea of dualism of the genders are misconstrued by dominant ideology and feeds into social norms of masculinity. Children learn and show development of gender identity as an ongoing process, based on social situations. Gendered toys can play a large role in demonstrating the preferred actions and behaviour of young boys in early childhood. The male role is also reinforced by observing older boys and reactions of authority figures, including parents. The promotion of idealized masculine roles emphasizing toughness, dominance, self-reliance, and the restriction of emotion can begin as early as infancy. Such norms are transmitted by parents, other male relatives, and members of the community. Media representations of masculinity on websites such as YouTube often promote similar stereotypical gender roles.\n\nAlthough gender socialization is well underway before children reach preschool, stereotypical differences between boys and girls are typically reinforced, rather than diminished, by their early educational childhood experiences. Teachers have a large role in reinforcing gender stereotypes by limiting children's choices at this young age, thus not allowing boys to explore their feelings or their understandings about gender freely. This is done through the endorsement of hegemonic masculinity embodying physical domination, strength, competitiveness, sport, courage, and aggression. These gendered performances are based on society's construction of femininity and masculinity in relation to heterosexuality. Heteronormativity is the standard for children; despite their obvious sexual innocence, heterosexuality is ingrained in children in their acting of gender from an early age.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to gendered behaviour and roles is the greater visibility, importance, and presence of males than females in literature, and in the language that teachers use for communication and instruction. Male-generic pronouns are a special problem in early childhood settings. A recommended method to help gender barriers disappear is specific training for teachers and more education on the topic for parents. Though, an ultimate conclusion by one author notes that young children know, feel, and think gender despite the wishes of adults to make gender disappear in their lives.\n\nA lifespan perspective must be considered when discussing gender normalization. But one must also consider cultural hegemony in this stage of the lifespan as a child develops more of an understanding of their culture and begins to display original ideas of cultural norms as well as social norms. According to the constructivist emphasis, the man/woman dichotomy is not the \"natural\" state, but rather a potent metaphor in Western cultures. Building social relationships and developing individuality are essential benchmarks for this age of middle childhood, which ranges from eight years old to puberty. A young boy is trying to navigate falling within the social structure that has been laid out for him, which includes interacting with both sexes, and a dominant notion of maleness. The gender environmentalism, which emphasizes the role of societal practices in generating and maintaining gender differentiation, still plays a part in this stage of life, but is possibly more influenced by immediate and close interactions with boys close to their age. The boys organize themselves in a hierarchical structure in which the high-status boys decide what is acceptable and valued – that which is hegemonically masculine – and what is not. A boy's rank in the hierarchy is chiefly determined by his athletic ability.\n\nOne site where gender is performed and socialized is in sport. Violent sports such as football are fundamental in naturalizing the equation of maleness with violence. Displays of strength and violence, through sports like football, help to naturalize elements of competition and hierarchy as inherently male behaviour. There is considerable evidence that males are hormonally predisposed to higher levels of aggression on average that females, due to the effects of testosterone. However, the violent and competitive nature of sports like football can only be an exclusively masculine domain if girls and women are excluded from participating altogether. The only means through which women are permitted to participate in football is as the passive spectator or cheerleader, although women do sometimes participate in other violent contact sports, such as boxing.\n\nWhen a child engages in behaviour or uses something that is more often associated with the opposite sex, this is referred to as crossing gender borders. When gender borders are crossed in adolescence, the children are policed by themselves. Conflicts and disagreements between boys are resolved by name-calling and teasing, physical aggression, and exclusion from the group. This brings confusion to the natural order of building their individualism, and stifles their creativity and freeplay, critical to developing lifelong skills in problem solving and decision making. Another notion which further confuses youth is \"multiple masculinities\" is introduced where variables such as social class, race, ethnicity, generation, and family status determines how these young men must perform their masculinity. Boys who fail to fit the social norm are forced to enter adolescence having experienced alienation from their social group and marginalized from the social order they strive to achieve in this stage of life.\n\nThe last stage of childhood, adolescence, marks the onset of puberty and the eventual beginning of adulthood. Hegemonic masculinity then positions some boys, and all girls, as subordinate or inferior to others. Bullying is another avenue in which young men assert their dominance over less \"masculine\" boys. In this bullying schema, adolescent boys are motivated to be at the top of the scale by engaging in more risk taking activities as well. Oftentimes bullying is motivated by social constructs and generalized ideas of what a young man should be. Gendered sexuality in adolescence refers to the role gender takes in the adolescent's life and how it is informed by and impacts others' perceptions of their sexuality. This can lead to gay bashing and other forms of discrimination if young men seem not to perform the appropriate masculinity.\n\nThe male gender role is not biologically fixed, yet it is a result of the internalization of culturally defined gender norms and ideologies. In this stage this is an important point as developmental psychologists recognize change in relations with parents, peers, and even their own self-identity. This is a time of confusion and disturbance; they feel influenced as a result of asserted hegemonic masculinity as well as social factors that lead them to become more self-conscious. De Visser et al., show that although men need not engage in all masculine behaviour to be considered masculine, enacting in more masculine behaviours increases the likelihood they will be considered more masculine, otherwise known as building \"masculine capital\". It has been suggested that boys' emotional stoicism leaves them unable to recognize their own and others' emotions, which leaves a risk for developing psychological distress and empty interpersonal skills. Boys in their adolescence are pressured to act masculine in order to fit the hegemonic ideals, yet the possibility of suffering long-term psychological damage as a result looms overhead.\n\nThe 1995 documentary, \"The Celluloid Closet\" discusses the depictions of homosexuals throughout film history. Furthermore, considering the media so heavily associates masculinity with heterosexual sex, it is no wonder that gay men in the media are given more feminine attributes, such as fragility, sensitivity, and a disregard for violence. Their disinterest in objectifying women's bodies makes them appear unmasculine. In Jackson Katz's film \"Tough Guise\": \"Violence, Media & the Crisis in Masculinity\", he explains:\n\nHegemonic masculinity has been used in education studies to understand the dynamics of classroom life, including patterns of resistance and bullying among boys. It was also used to explore relations to the curriculum and the difficulties in gender-neutral pedagogy. It was used to understand teaching strategies and teacher identities among such groups as physical education instructors. This concept has also been helpful in structuring violence-prevention programs for youth. and emotional education programs for boys.\n\nHegemonic masculinity has greatly influenced criminology as data reflects that men and boys perpetuate more conventional crimes and more serious crimes than women and girls. Moreover, men are responsible for much more white-collar crimes than women as well. The concept of hegemonic masculinity helped in theorizing the relationship among masculinities and a variety of crimes. It was also used in studies on specific crimes by boys and men, such as rape in Switzerland, murder in Australia, football hooliganism and white-collar crime in England, and assaultive violence in the United States. Regarding costs and consequences, research in criminology showed how particular patterns of aggression were linked with hegemonic masculinity, not because criminals already had dominant positions, but because they were pursuing them.\n\nHegemonic masculinity has also been employed in studying media representations of men. Because the concept of hegemony helps to make sense of both the diversity and the selectiveness of images in mass media, media researchers have begun mapping the relations between different masculinities. Portrayals of masculinity in men's lifestyle magazines have been studied and researchers found elements of hegemonic masculinity woven throughout them. Commercial sports are a focus of media representations of masculinity, and the developing field of sports sociology found significant use of the concept of hegemonic masculinity. It was deployed in understanding the popularity of body-contact confrontational sports which function as an endlessly renewed symbol of masculinity and in understanding the violence and homophobia frequently found in sporting environments. American football, and the prevalence of concussions in the sport, is a particularly salient example of the impacts of hegemonic masculinity. With the dominant mode of hegemonic masculinity valuing emotionlessness, invulnerability, toughness, and risk-taking, concussions have become normalized. Players have accepted them as simply \"part of the game\". If a man does not play through a concussion, he risks being blamed for the team's loss, or labelled as effeminate. It is noble to play in pain, nobler to play in agony, and noblest if one never exhibits any sign of pain at all. Coaches buy into this unwritten code of masculinity as well, by invoking euphemisms such as \"he needs to learn the difference between injury and pain\", while also questioning a player's masculinity to get him back on the field quickly. Players, coaches, and trainers subscribe to the hegemonic model, thus creating a culture of dismissiveness, often resulting in concussions, which can lead to brain diseases like CTE.\n\nHegemonic masculinity has been increasingly used to understand men's health practices and determinants. Practices such as playing through physical injuries and risk-taking sexual behaviour such as unprotected sex with multiple partners have been studied. The concept has also been used to understand men's exposure to risk and their difficulty in responding to disability and injury. Hegemonic masculine ideals, especially stoicism, emotionlessness, and invulnerability can help explain an aversion to seeking mental health care. Men are less likely than women to seek professional services psychiatrists or counsellors, informal help through friends, and are more likely to report that they would never seek psychotherapy for depression. In fact, men who adhere to the masculine norm of stoicism have difficulty in identifying grief, sadness, or a depressed mood, some of the conventional diagnostic symptoms of depression. Recognition of weakness would be a recognition of femininity, and as such, men distract themselves, avoid the problem, or get angry – one of the few emotions permissible under hegemonic masculine norms – when depressive symptoms surface. On a global scale, the impact of hegemonic masculinity has been considered in determining unequal social and political relations which are deleterious to the health of both men and women.\n\nHegemonic masculinity has proved significant in organizational studies as the gendered character of workplaces and bureaucracies has been increasingly recognized. A particular focus has been placed on the military, where specific patterns of hegemonic masculinity have been entrenched but have been increasingly problematic. These studies found that negative hegemonically masculine characteristics related to violence and aggression were required to thrive in the military at all ranks and in all branches. Additionally homophobic ideals were commonplace and further subordinated men in these positions. Studies have also traced the institutionalization of hegemonic masculinities in specific organizations and their role in organizational decision making. This can be related to the glass ceiling and gender pay gap women experience.\n\n\"Tough guy\" attributes like unwillingness to admit ignorance, admit mistakes, or ask for help can undermine safety culture and productivity, by interfering with exchange of useful information. A Harvard Business School study found an intervention to improve the culture at Shell Oil during the construction of the Ursa tension leg platform contributed to increased productivity and an 84% lower accident rate.\n\nHegemonic masculinity has impacted both conflict and international relations, serving as a foundation for militarism. Charlotte Hooper discusses how US foreign policy, following the Vietnam War, was seen as a way of bolstering America's manhood. It was believed that the Vietcong, often categorized \"as a bunch of women and children\", had humiliated and emasculated America. In order to regain its manhood – both domestically and internationally – America needed to develop a hyper-masculinized and aggressive breed of foreign policy. Hooper also discusses the idea that since the international sphere is largely composed of men, it may greatly shape both \"the production and maintenance of masculinities.\" War, then, exists in a unique feedback loop whereby it is not only perpetuated by hegemonic masculinity, but also legitimates masculinity.\n\nHooper discusses how military combat has been fundamental to the very composition of masculinity \"symbolically, institutionally\", and culturally through body shape. Moreover, Hooper discusses how women are seen as life givers, while men are believed to be life takers. As a result, men can only exist as men if they are willing to charge into war, thereby expressing their \"enduring 'natural aggression'.\" Furthermore, this perception also explains the traditional \"exclusion of women from combat\", while furthering the myth \"that military service is the fullest expression of masculinity.\" This has troubling implications for the continuation of war, and for the enshrinement of masculine norms. Hooper also ideates about the instillation of militarized masculinity in boys, discussing how military service is a \"rite of passage\" for young men. As such, \"war and the military represent one of the major sites where hegemonic masculinities\" are formed and enshrined.\n\nMilitarized hegemonic masculinity has also impacted perceptions of citizenship as well as the LGBT community. Conscription is fairly common throughout the world, and has also been utilized in America during key conflicts. The majority of men expect conscription to be the price of adult citizenship, but religious objectors and homosexuals have been largely excluded from this. These restrictions have led to the perceived subordinate status of these groups, and their subsequent exclusion from full citizenship, in the same fashion that women have been excluded. This is reflective of the notion that men unable to, or unwilling to fight for their country are more effeminate, as they are breaking with hegemonic norms. The perceptions that homosexuals are unfit for service, and that women have a responsibility at home, is reflective of the heteronormative nature of the military. The institutional composition of the military, itself, reinforces this hegemony through the armed branch's subordination to a \"dominating and organizationally competent\" branch. Essentially, there is an armed wing, which is masculinized through conflict, and there is a dominating branch that is masculinized through power. The hierarchical nature of the military is used to enforce, replicate, and enhance hegemonic masculinity.\n\nMale rape is especially prevalent in male dominant environments, such as in the military and prison. In a 2014 \"GQ\" article titled \"'Son, Men Don't Get Raped'\", nearly 30 sexual assault survivors come forward to discuss rape in the military. According to the Pentagon, 38 military men are sexually assaulted every day. The majority of the victims' stories involve a highly ranked perpetrator, such as senior aides, recruiters, or sergeants, which are positions that young soldiers look up to. Some victims describe being weaker than the attacker and physically unable to stop the rape, while others felt too mentally dominated to speak up. Either way, the men were met with defeat and emasculation. In the article, the psychologist James Asbrand, who specializes in posttraumatic stress disorder, explains, \"The rape of a male soldier has a particular symbolism. 'In a hyper masculine culture, what's the worst thing you can do to another man?' Force him into what the culture perceives as a feminine role. Completely dominate and rape him.\" Asbrand refers to the military as a hypermasculine environment, which is consistent with its media portrayal. Joining the army is considered a noble act for men, which military movies, advertisements, and video games reinforce. Because of this, it is no surprise that recruits would likely embody stereotypical masculine personas, and therefore contribute to an environment of competition.\n\nConnell argues that a salient feature of hegemonic masculinity is the use of \"toxic\" practices such as physical violence, which may serve to reinforce men's dominance over women in Western societies. Other scholars have used the term \"toxic masculinity\" to refer to stereotypically masculine gender roles that restrict the kinds of emotions allowable for boys and men to express, including social expectations that men seek to be dominant (the \"alpha male\") and limit their emotional range primarily to expressions of anger.\n\nTerry Kupers defines toxic masculinity as \"the constellation of socially regressive male traits that serve to foster domination, the devaluation of women, homophobia and wanton violence\". According to Kupers, toxic masculinity serves to outline aspects of hegemonic masculinity that are socially destructive, \"such as misogyny, homophobia, greed, and violent domination\". These traits are contrasted with more positive aspects of hegemonic masculinity such as \"pride in [one's] ability to win at sports, to maintain solidarity with a friend, to succeed at work, or to provide for [one's] family\".\n\nToxic masculine norms are a feature of life for men in American prisons, where they are reflected in the behaviour of both staff and inmates. The qualities of extreme self-reliance, domination of other men through violence, and avoiding the appearance of either femininity or weakness, comprise an unspoken code among prisoners. Suppressing vulnerable emotions is often adopted in order to successfully cope with the harsh conditions of prison life, defined by punishment, social isolation, and aggression. These factors likely play a role in suicide among male prisoners.\n\nBullying of boys by their peers and domestic violence experienced by boys at home can also be expressions of toxic masculinity. The often violent socialization of boys produces psychological trauma through the promotion of aggression and lack of interpersonal connection. Such trauma is often disregarded, such as in the saying \"boys will be boys\" with regard to bullying.\n\nMen who adhere to traditionally masculine cultural norms, such as risk-taking, violence, dominance, primacy of work, need for emotional control, desire to win, and pursuit of social status, tend to be more likely to experience psychological problems such as depression, stress, body image problems, substance abuse, and poor social functioning. The effect tends to be stronger in men who also emphasize masculine norms, such as self-reliance, seeking power over women, and sexual promiscuity or \"playboy\" behaviour.\n\nThe social value of self-reliance has diminished over time as modern American society has moved more toward interdependence. Both self-reliance and the stifling of emotional expression can work against mental health, as they make it less likely for men to seek psychological help or to possess the ability to deal with difficult emotions. Preliminary research suggests that cultural pressure for men to be stoic and self-reliant may also shorten men's lifespans by causing them to be less likely to discuss health problems with their physicians.\n\nSome authors associated with the mythopoetic men's movement have referred to the social pressures placed upon men to be violent, competitive, independent, and unfeeling as a \"toxic\" form of masculinity, in contrast to a \"real\" or \"deep\" masculinity that they say men have lost touch with in modern society. The academic Shepherd Bliss proposed a return to agrarianism as an alternative to the \"potentially toxic masculinity\" of the warrior ethic. Sociologist Michael Kimmel writes that Bliss's notion of toxic masculinity can be seen as part of the mythopoetic movement's response to male feelings of powerlessness at a time when the feminist movement was challenging traditional male authority:\n\n"}

He is the creator of the Pop Culture Detective Agency video series examining intersections of politics, masculinity, and entertainment. He was also a producer and co-writer on the \"Tropes vs. Women in Video Games\" YouTube video series.\n\nMcIntosh produced video mashups early in his film career. A proponent of remix culture, he spoke on the topic and how media produced in this fashion can be uniquely powerful tools for commenting on political and social issues.\n\nAmerican academic and political activist Lawrence Lessig cites McIntosh's work as among his favorites in the book Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy for its ability to deliver \"a message more powerfully than any original alone could.\" \n\nIn 2012, McIntosh spoke before the United States Copyright Office to advocate for exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act—a law designed to criminalize the unauthorized production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services regarding copyrighted works—that was adversely affecting video artists like himself. His 2009 video, \"Buffy versus Edward: Twilight Remixed\"—a high-profile mashup video and Webby Award nominee for remixing—was used as an example in the copyright discussion. The final rulemaking stated an exemption for: \"Motion pictures (including television shows and videos), as defined in 17 U.S.C. 101, where circumvention is undertaken solely in order to make use of short portions of the motion pictures for the purpose of criticism or comment in limited instances.\" It specifically points out \"Buffy versus Edward: Twilight Remixed\" in the rulemaking: Based on the video evidence presented, the Register is able to conclude that diminished quality likely would impair the criticism and comment contained in noncommercial videos. For example, the Register is able to perceive that Buffy vs Edward and other noncommercial videos would suffer significantly because of blurring and the loss of detail in characters’ expression and sense of depth.\n\nFrom 2013-2015, McIntosh worked on the Tropes vs. Women in Video Games YouTube video series as a producer and co-writer. The web series was a highly successful Kickstarter created by Anita Sarkeesian that examined gender tropes in video games.\n\nIn 2016 McIntosh launched the Pop Culture Detective Agency, a Patreon-funded web series examining the intersections of politics, masculinity, and entertainment. The long-form video essays examine a variety of topics within these themes. One episode explored the concept of toxic masculinity through an American pop culture lens. Other episodes are devoted to examining specific pieces of pop culture, such as television programs Steven Universe and The Big Bang Theory, and films including Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Star Wars. Some of the videos produced in the series propose new cultural tropes in which to understand the topics discussed, such as \"Born Sexy Yesterday\", which seeks to explain how fictional characters exhibit men’s fear of experienced women.\n\nIn 2014, McIntosh wrote the opinion piece, \"Playing with privilege: the invisible benefits of gaming while male\", which addressed the Gamergate controversy that had been receiving increasing media attention and public discourse. In the piece, he sought to address the underlying problems that contributed toward sexism in video gaming by examining the inherent privileges that male-identified gamers benefit from. Taking inspiration from the famous \"Daily Effects of White Privilege\" list by Peggy McIntosh, among others, McIntosh listed 25 Daily Effects of Male Game Privilege. These included such privileges as \"I will never be asked or expected to speak for all other gamers who share my gender.\"\n\n"}

His book \"2012: Decoding the Countercultural Apocalypse\" which brought together scholarly analyses of the end of the world phenomenon from anthropology, Mayan studies, religious studies and cultural studies attracted considerable media attention. He continues to examine spiritual and gender issues using rigorous academic methods and cross disciplinary studies.\n\nGelfer is the founding and current editor of Journal of Men, Masculinities and Spirituality, creator of the Future Masculinity online course and Director of Masculinity Research\n\nGelfer has a BA Hons from University of Bristol and a doctorate in religious studies from Victoria University of Wellington. His thesis was titled \"Numen, old men : contemporary masculine spiritualities and the problem of patriarchy.\"\n\nJoseph Gelfer is a lecturer and tutor at Université Catholique de l'Ouest. He has had concurrent careers in research in religion and masculinities and in academic editing and coaching. He has held positions as Adjunct Research Associate at the School of Political and Social Inquiry at Monash University, Honorary Research Associate at University of Divinity, Melbourne, as Editorial Specialist at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and an Assistant Editor at the University of Londo n.\n\nThe book derived from his doctoral thesis, \"Numen, Old Men: Contemporary Masculine Spiritualities and the Problem of Patriarchy\" (Equinox Publishers, 2009) proposed that masculine spirituality tends to perpetuate a patriarchal spirituality, and that gay spirituality and queer theory can be a useful way to think about masculinities for all men, gay or straight. He has published extensively on how masculinity functions in contemporary society and, more specifically, in contemporary religion. He proposes that by questioning the social construction of masculinity in the everyday it is possible to create a more equitable and sustainable society.\n\nLeading up to and during 2012 Gelfer received media attention surrounding the publishing of his book \"2012: Decoding the Countercultural Apocalypse\" which brought together scholarly analyses of the end of the world phenomenon from anthropology, Mayan studies, religious studies and cultural studies. The book examined the \"merits and demerits of cultural appropriation\" and \"the lack of consensus between different scholars and the inconsistent goals of different disciplines.\" Gelfer's aim in writing the book was \"to strike some balance between visionary and critical thinking\" and he was criticised by members from the skeptical, catastrophist, conspiracy and spiritually inclined communities for his non-partisan views. His proposition from the book's analysis was that no physical event would occur but \"that people [would] realise the changes they dearly wish to see in the world will not come from some cosmic source, but rather instead political agency and social activism. And that, ironically, may result in 2012 being a catalyst for a shift in human consciousness, exactly as the prophets predicted.\"\n\nIn addition to his academic work, Gelfer has also been active in social commentary publishing articles about such wide-ranging topics as psychedelic substances within a spiritual context, the commercialisation of spiritualities, child discipline, open access publishing and teetotalism. He has also published a number of travel articles and a book of Latrinalia called \"The Little Book of Toilet Graffiti\" (which according to Gelfer was simply a fund raising exercise and was followed by \"The Little Book of Student Bollocks\" and \"The Little Book of Office Bollocks).\"\n\n\nIn 2012 Gelfer undertook a number of interviews on a variety of topics published through InformitTV. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Schaeffer is Professor of Tibetan and Buddhist Studies at the University of Virginia and Chair of the Religious Studies department. His primary topics of research are the history of the regions of Nepal, India, Tibet, and China, with a focus on the forms of Buddhism present in these areas, most especially Tibetan Buddhism. Some specific issues he has been concentrated on include Indo-Tibetan poetry, the development of classical learning and printed literature in Tibetan cultural regions, and the history of women, saints, and Dalai Lamas in Tibet. For his work, Schaeffer has received Fulbright, Ryskamp, and Whiting fellowships.\n\nSchaeffer received a B.A. in Religious Studies from Lewis & Clark College in 1988, and an additional B.A. from the Evergreen State College in 1990. He received a Master of Arts (M.A.) in Buddhist Studies from the University of Washington in 1995 and then a Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) from Harvard University in 2000 in Tibetan and South Asian Religions.\n\nIn 2000, he was appointed assistant professor at the University of Alabama in the Department of Religious Studies. In 2003, he took a leave of absence for the entire year with the backing of a Mellon Foundation Fellowship. Schaeffer was awarded tenure and promoted to the position of associate professor a year early, in 2004. In late 2005, Schaeffer took a position at the University of Virginia as an associate professor in the Department of Religious Studies, specifically in Tibetan and Buddhist studies, where he oversees the study and research of over twenty graduate students.\nHe is also the past co-director, with Frances Garrett, of the Tibetan and Himalayan Religious Group in the American Academy of Religion (AAR). From 2005 to present, he served as a co-director for The Tibetan Buddhist Canonical Collections Cataloging Project for the Tibetan and Himalayan Library. He has also been Book Review Editor for the Journal of the American Academy of Religion from 2006 to the present, as well as for the Journal of the International Association for Tibetan Studies from 2005 to date.\n\nSchaeffer has written and edited several books, as well as numerous scholarly articles. Schaeffer's first book, \"Himalayan Hermitess: The Life of a Tibetan Buddhist Nun,\" was published by Oxford University Press in 2004. In this book, Schaeffer examines the autobiography (Tib: rnam thar) of a seventeenth-century Nepalese Buddhist nun, Orgyan Chokyi. Scaheffer is particularly interested in how the autobiography reveals women's voice within Tibetan Buddhist practice, voices which are often overlooked, ignored, or silenced. Through this, he explores the unique perspectives on Tibetan Buddhist doctrine and practice Orgyan Chokyi brings to light through her autobiography, including a more localized religious life, an emphasis on the physicality of the body in practice, and a particular focus on the day-to-day reality of suffering.\n\nSchaeffer followed \"Himalayan Hermitess\" with \"Dreaming the Great Brahmin: Tibetan Traditions of the Buddhist Poet Saint Saraha,\" where he works to broaden the idea of \"tradition\" as it relates to the Tibetan cultural world from the actions of a singular historical author to the multivariant roles and agencies of a given text throughout Tibetan life. In this work, Schaeffer seeks to explore the creative traditions which surrounded the figure of Saraha and gave him life throughout the Tibetan Buddhist world long after his death, including exposing conflicted, and at times, contradictory visions of the century Indian figures life, actions, and teachings.\n\nSchaeffer has continued to encourage a broad understanding of Tibetan culture and tradition, particularly through his 2014 book, \"The Culture of the Book in Tibet,\" published through Columbia University Press. This work explores the contours of Tibetan book production, consumption, and use to reveal the significant, yet incredibly variable, role of books in Tibetan cultural life. Through this, Schaeffer reveals not only the crucial role of textual criticism and scholarship in Tibetan Buddhist practice, but also how Tibetan books simultaneously functioned as relics and sites of devotional activity.\n\nBeyond his monographs, Schaeffer has also edited several volumes, including \"Among Tibetan Texts: Essays on Tibetan Religion, Literature, and History by E. Gene Smith,\" (Wisdom Publications, 2001), \"Power, Politics, and the Reinvention of Tradition: Tibet in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries\" (Brill Publishers, 2006; co-edited with Bryan J. Cuevas). Most recently, Schaeffer edited two volumes in 2013 for Columbia University Press--\"Sources of Tibetan Tradition\" (co-edited with Gray Tuttle) and \"The Tibetan History Reader\" (co-edited with Gray Tuttle and Matthew Kapstein)--both of which make the recent research into Tibetan history, doctrine, and culture available for both academic researchers and for students in college classrooms.\n\nContinuing to produce foundational texts for classroom settings, Schaeffer has recently produced a translation of a life of the Buddha written by eighteenth-century Bhutanese intellectual Tenzin Chögyel (New York: Penguin Publishing, 2015). This work not only provides a clear translation of the Buddha's life narrative with helpful explanatory notes, but also includes an introduction by Schaeffer exploring the stylized format of the Buddha's life narrative and its potential to contain multiple interpretations of the Buddha's ontological identity.\n\nBeyond monographs and edited volumes, Schaeffer has also written a number of academic papers and encyclopedia articles.\n"}

The oil painting depicts Picasso's mistress and muse, Marie-Thérèse Walter, asleep with a book upon her lap. The painting led to the breakup of Picasso's marriage to Olga Khokhlova after she saw it at a retrospective exhibition and realised that the facial features were not her own. The painting went to auction in 1989 and in 1996, where it failed to sell. In January 2011, it was announced that \"La Lecture\" would be going to auction on 8 February. The painting, which had not been seen in Europe since the exhibition, was then displayed at Sotheby's in Paris.\n\nPicasso met Marie-Thérèse Walter in 1927 as she exited the Paris Metro and they later began a relationship, which they kept secret because she was only seventeen and Picasso was married to Olga Khokhlova. Until he painted \"La Lecture\", Picasso often embedded some of Walter's features in the backgrounds of his other works. When \"La Lecture\" was exhibited at a Picasso retrospective, Khokhlova realised that her husband was in a relationship with another woman after noticing that the facial features in the painting were not hers. She ended her marriage to Picasso shortly afterward. Walter later inspired other Picasso works including \"Le Rêve\", which Picasso painted in the same month as \"La Lecture\", and \"Nude, Green Leaves and Bust\". On Walter's influence on Picasso and his work, \"The Art Wolf\" said \"Marie-Thérès's potent mix of physical attractiveness and sexual naivety had an intoxicating effect on Picasso, and his rapturous desire for her brought about a number of images that are among the most sought after of his long career.\"\n\nPicasso painted \"La Lecture\" from December 1931 to its completion in January 1932 during, what art experts have named, his \"lovestruck period.\" The painting is oil on panel and is 65.5 by 51 centimeters. Picasso has used bright colours, including yellow and green, to depict a nude Walter asleep in a chair with a book in her lap. Mark Brown of \"The Guardian\" said the book in Walter's lap is a \"sexual symbol\" and the painting has been described as being sensual, erotic and happy. Of the painting and Picasso, Philip Hook from Sotheby's said \"In the early 1930s he was very lyrically in love and reflected that in these gorgeous colors, and lovely compositions. This period is just about the most desirable of all Picasso's (periods), certainly in market terms.\" As Picasso painted \"La Lecture\" just days apart from \"La Rêve\", the two paintings are very similar in composition.\n\nThe painting was auctioned in 1989 and it sold for $5.8 million. In 1996, \"La Lecture\" went to auction again at Christie's in New York. It was estimated to sell between $6–8 million, but it failed to sell after bidding stopped at $4.8 million. \"The Independent\" reported that many people had judged the painting to be \"over-valued.\" Over the years, the painting has been owned by American art collectors Keith Warner, David Lloyd Kreeger and James W. Alsdorf.\n\nIn January 2011, it was announced that \"La Lecture\" would be included in an Impressionist and Modern art sale by Sotheby's in London on 8 February 2011. The work was being sold by an American collector. Ahead of the auction, \"La Lecture\", which had not been seen in Europe since the Picasso retrospective, went on display in Paris. The painting was estimated to fetch between £12–18 million and Helena Newman from Sotheby's said that the painting will \"excite a lot of interest.\" On 8 February, \"La Lecture\" was sold in six minutes to an anonymous telephone bidder for £25.2 million ($40.7 million).\n"}

{"id": "11404473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11404473", "title": "Mapback", "text": "Mapback\n\nMapback is a term used by paperback collectors to refer to the earliest paperback books published by Dell Books, beginning in 1943. The books are known as mapbacks because the back cover of the book contains a map that illustrates the location of the action. Dell books were numbered in series. Mapbacks extend from #5 to at least #550; then maps became less of a fixed feature of the books and disappeared entirely in 1951. (Numbers 1 through 4 had no map, although a later re-publication of #4, \"The American Gun Mystery\" by Ellery Queen, added a map.) The occasional number in the series between #5 and #550 contains no map, but some sort of full-page graphic or text connected with the book's contents. \n\nThe artwork of the maps began with quite detailed maps, and later numbers contain more stylized ones. \"The back cover map was very popular with readers and remains popular with collectors ... the Dell 'mapbacks' are among the most well known vintage paperbacks.\"\n\n\"Dell's most memorable design innovation was not on the front but on the back covers ... the entire back covers given over to maps, or variously charts, blueprints, or what have you to represent story locale or scene of the crime: a stretch of California highway, the interior of an apartment, a sheik's 'city of stones.' It was an enjoyable if slightly goofy gimmick and, amazingly, managed to last nearly ten years.\"\n\n\"Besides distinctive front covers and back-cover maps, Dell paperbacks also had a number of other interesting features, including an \"eye-in-keyhole\" logo, front-cover blurbs, character lists, lists of key items or events in the book (\"tantalizer-pages\"), crowded title pages, and special chapter titles.\"\n\nSome publishers, including Dell, thoughtfully included brief lists of the main characters in their books -- especially in mysteries -- to allow readers to keep the characters straight. In mapbacks, \"Persons this Mystery is about\" followed the inside flyleaf, and gave a short descriptive paragraph. For instance, the protagonist of the mapback shown at right is described as follows:\n\nThe \"tantalizer-pages\" contained two features meant to entice the browsing reader. \"What this Mystery is about\" gives a list of clues and events that are found within. Those from \"Rim of the Pit\" include:\n\nAnd the enticing section, \"Wouldn't you like to Know --\"\n\nOf course, non-mysteries had somewhat less tantalizing clues and questions, but the same format was kept. The \"List of Exciting Chapters\" featured chapter titles which were frequently added or changed by Dell editors.\n\nMapbacks were primarily mysteries, but many different sorts of books found their way into this inclusive line. A few oddities were published without a map on the back cover. Dell \"War Books\" such as #26, \"The Raft\" and #32, \"This Time For Keeps\", had back covers which exhorted the reader to \"Buy War Bonds and Stamps\", as did books of jokes and cartoons such as #38, \"Liberty Laughs\" and #77, \"G.I. Jokes\". The rarest mapback of all is #278, \"Second Dell Book of Crossword Puzzles\" edited by Kathleen Rafferty, also map-less. \n\nTwo other genres which had a number of entries in the mapback line were romances and Westerns. Romances were not frequent, and were by \"name\" authors such as Faith Baldwin (#116, \"Honor Bound\") and Mary Renault (#189, \"Kind Are Her Answers\"), only occasionally descending to the level of the \"nurse romance\". The quality of Westerns was also generally high, including authors such as William MacLeod Raine (#179, \"Trail's End\") and Bliss Lomax (Harry Sinclair Drago) (#271, \"Gunsmoke and Trail Dust\"). \n\nThere are a number of movie tie-in novels in the series. One of the most significant is #262, \"Rope\" as by Alfred Hitchcock -- actually written by Don Ward -- with a cover featuring James Stewart. The second mapback edition of Gerald Butler's \"Kiss The Blood Off My Hands\" is published as \"The Unafraid\", with a cover photograph of Joan Fontaine and Burt Lancaster. Other novels in the series are those upon which well-known films were based, although without movie tie-in covers -- these include \"Tugboat Annie\", \"The Sheik\", \"Now, Voyager\", \"The Harvey Girls\" and Mary Roberts Rinehart's \"The Bat\". \n\nBut by far the largest number of mapbacks is made up of mysteries. The mapback series contains some significant first editions (\"first as such\") by famous authors such as Dashiell Hammett, and interesting editions of such authors as Rex Stout (\"\" #45; \"The Red Bull\" #70), Agatha Christie, Cornell Woolrich, Erle Stanley Gardner writing as A. A. Fair, John Dickson Carr and his alter ego Carter Dickson, and Ellery Queen. There are editions of other mysteries which have stood the test of time and are still considered moderately significant today, such as the works of Phoebe Atwood Taylor (under her own name and as Alice Tilton), Patricia Wentworth, Stuart Palmer, Clayton Rawson, Earl Derr Biggers, Patricia McGerr, Baynard Kendrick, Margaret Millar, Mary Roberts Rinehart, C. W. Grafton (father of Sue Grafton) and many others. \n\nThe Dell mapback line also contains a number of mysteries by writers who have fallen out of favor over the years -- or who were never popular. Collectors cherish the camp value of such mysteries as \"Murder Wears Mukluks\" by Eunice Mays Boyd, \"The Body That Wasn't Uncle\" by George Worthing Yates, and \"Death Wears a White Gardenia\" by Zelda Popkin.\n\nThe mapback line is also notable for what it does not contain -- mapbacks never partook of two popular trends in the 1950s that flourished at other paperback houses, namely the \"lesbian confession\" novel and the \"juvenile delinquent\" or \"juvie\" novel.\n\n"}

She worked in publishing and agitprop theatre, and became secretary of the party's Lehreverband (1930) and worked at the \"Rote Revue\". In 1931, she took a diction class from Brecht's wife Helene Weigel and became his lover. She was introduced to the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm, playing a maid in \"Die Mutter\" (1932).\n\nIn 1933 Brecht and Weigel went into exile in Denmark. Though soon replaced as Brecht's lover by Ruth Berlau, Steffin entered an arranged marriage to a Danish citizen to stay as Brecht's secretary and followed the Brechts to Finland and Moscow when war broke out. She died from tuberculosis (diagnosed already in 1931) while awaiting an American visa. Brecht wrote six short poems on hearing of her death, eventually published together as \"Nach dem Tod meiner Mitarbeiterin M.

Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics, and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using aphasiology, brain imaging, electrophysiology, and computer modeling.\n\nNeurolinguistics is historically rooted in the development in the 19th century of aphasiology, the study of linguistic deficits (aphasias) occurring as the result of brain damage. Aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing. One of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was Paul Broca, a French surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies, and found that most of them had brain damage (or \"lesions\") on the left frontal lobe, in an area now known as Broca's area. Phrenologists had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain, but Broca's research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship, and has been described as \"epoch-making\" and \"pivotal\" to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science. Later, Carl Wernicke, after whom Wernicke's area is named, proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks, with Broca's area handling the motor production of speech, and Wernicke's area handling auditory speech comprehension. The work of Broca and Wernicke established the field of aphasiology and the idea that language can be studied through examining physical characteristics of the brain. Early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of Korbinian Brodmann, who \"mapped\" the surface of the brain, dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area's cytoarchitecture (cell structure) and function; these areas, known as Brodmann areas, are still widely used in neuroscience today.\n\nThe coining of the term \"neurolinguistics\" is attributed to Edith Crowell Trager, Henri Hecaen and Alexandr Luria, in the late 1940s and 1950s; Luria's book \"Problems in Neurolinguistics\" is likely the first book with Neurolinguistics in the title. Harry Whitaker popularized neurolinguistics in the United States in the 1970s, founding the journal \"Brain and Language\" in 1974.\n\nAlthough aphasiology is the historical core of neurolinguistics, in recent years the field has broadened considerably, thanks in part to the emergence of new brain imaging technologies (such as PET and fMRI) and time-sensitive electrophysiological techniques (EEG and MEG), which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks; electrophysiological techniques, in particular, emerged as a viable method for the study of language in 1980 with the discovery of the N400, a brain response shown to be sensitive to semantic issues in language comprehension. The N400 was the first language-relevant event-related potential to be identified, and since its discovery EEG and MEG have become increasingly widely used for conducting language research.\n\nNeurolinguistics is closely related to the field of psycholinguistics, which seeks to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of experimental psychology; today, psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another, and there is much collaboration between the two fields.\n\nMuch work in neurolinguistics involves testing and evaluating theories put forth by psycholinguists and theoretical linguists. In general, theoretical linguists propose models to explain the structure of language and how language information is organized, psycholinguists propose models and algorithms to explain how language information is processed in the mind, and neurolinguists analyze brain activity to infer how biological structures (populations and networks of neurons) carry out those psycholinguistic processing algorithms. For example, experiments in sentence processing have used the ELAN, N400, and P600 brain responses to examine how physiological brain responses reflect the different predictions of sentence processing models put forth by psycholinguists, such as Janet Fodor and Lyn Frazier's \"serial\" model, and Theo Vosse and Gerard Kempen's \"unification model\". Neurolinguists can also make new predictions about the structure and organization of language based on insights about the physiology of the brain, by \"generalizing from the knowledge of neurological structures to language structure\".\n\nNeurolinguistics research is carried out in all the major areas of linguistics; the main linguistic subfields, and how neurolinguistics addresses them, are given in the table below.\n\nNeurolinguistics research investigates several topics, including where language information is processed, how language processing unfolds over time, how brain structures are related to language acquisition and learning, and how neurophysiology can contribute to speech and language pathology.\n\nMuch work in neurolinguistics has, like Broca's and Wernicke's early studies, investigated the locations of specific language \"modules\" within the brain. Research questions include what course language information follows through the brain as it is processed, whether or not particular areas specialize in processing particular sorts of information, how different brain regions interact with one another in language processing, and how the locations of brain activation differs when a subject is producing or perceiving a language other than his or her first language.\n\nAnother area of neurolinguistics literature involves the use of electrophysiological techniques to analyze the rapid processing of language in time. The temporal ordering of specific patterns of in brain activity may reflect discrete computational processes that the brain undergoes during language processing; for example, one neurolinguistic theory of sentence parsing proposes that three brain responses (the ELAN, N400, and P600) are products of three different steps in syntactic and semantic processing.\n\nAnother topic is the relationship between brain structures and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.\nNeuroplasticity is observed when both Second Language acquisition and Language Learning experience are induced, the result of this language exposure concludes that an increase of gray and white matter could be found in children, young adults and the elderly.\n\nPing Li, Jennifer Legault, Kaitlyn A. Litcofsky, May 2014.\nNeuroplasticity as a function of second language learning: Anatomical changes in the human brain\nCortex: A Journal Devoted to the Study of the Nervous System & Behavior, 410.1016/j.cortex.2014.05.00124996640\n\nNeurolinguistic techniques are also used to study disorders and breakdowns in language, such as aphasia and dyslexia, and how they relate to physical characteristics of the brain.\n\nSince one of the focuses of this field is the testing of linguistic and psycholinguistic models, the technology used for experiments is highly relevant to the study of neurolinguistics. Modern brain imaging techniques have contributed greatly to a growing understanding of the anatomical organization of linguistic functions. Brain imaging methods used in neurolinguistics may be classified into hemodynamic methods, electrophysiological methods, and methods that stimulate the cortex directly.\n\nHemodynamic techniques take advantage of the fact that when an area of the brain works at a task, blood is sent to supply that area with oxygen (in what is known as the Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent, or BOLD, response). Such techniques include PET and fMRI. These techniques provide high \"spatial resolution\", allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of activity within the brain; \"temporal resolution\" (or information about the timing of brain activity), on the other hand, is poor, since the BOLD response happens much more slowly than language processing. In addition to demonstrating which parts of the brain may subserve specific language tasks or computations, hemodynamic methods have also been used to demonstrate how the structure of the brain's language architecture and the distribution of language-related activation may change over time, as a function of linguistic exposure.\n\nIn addition to PET and fMRI, which show which areas of the brain are activated by certain tasks, researchers also use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which shows the neural pathways that connect different brain areas, thus providing insight into how different areas interact. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is another hemodynamic method used in language tasks.\n\nElectrophysiological techniques take advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons in the brain fire together, they create an electric dipole or current. The technique of EEG measures this electric current using sensors on the scalp, while MEG measures the magnetic fields that are generated by these currents. In addition to these non-invasive methods, electrocorticography has also been used to study language processing. These techniques are able to measure brain activity from one millisecond to the next, providing excellent \"temporal resolution\", which is important in studying processes that take place as quickly as language comprehension and production. On the other hand, the location of brain activity can be difficult to identify in EEG; consequently, this technique is used primarily to \"how\" language processes are carried out, rather than \"where\". Research using EEG and MEG generally focuses on event-related potentials (ERPs), which are distinct brain responses (generally realized as negative or positive peaks on a graph of neural activity) elicited in response to a particular stimulus. Studies using ERP may focus on each ERP's \"latency\" (how long after the stimulus the ERP begins or peaks), \"amplitude\" (how high or low the peak is), or \"topography\" (where on the scalp the ERP response is picked up by sensors). Some important and common ERP components include the N400 (a negativity occurring at a latency of about 400 milliseconds), the mismatch negativity, the early left anterior negativity (a negativity occurring at an early latency and a front-left topography), the P600, and the lateralized readiness potential.\n\nNeurolinguists employ a variety of experimental techniques in order to use brain imaging to draw conclusions about how language is represented and processed in the brain. These techniques include the \"subtraction\" paradigm, \"mismatch design\", \"violation-based\" studies, various forms of \"priming\", and \"direct stimulation\" of the brain.\n\nMany language studies, particularly in fMRI, use the subtraction paradigm, in which brain activation in a task thought to involve some aspect of language processing is compared against activation in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes but not to involve the linguistic process. For example, activations while participants read words may be compared to baseline activations while participants read strings of random letters (in attempt to isolate activation related to lexical processing—the processing of real words), or activations while participants read syntactically complex sentences may be compared to baseline activations while participants read simpler sentences.\n\nThe mismatch negativity (MMN) is a rigorously documented ERP component frequently used in neurolinguistic experiments. It is an electrophysiological response that occurs in the brain when a subject hears a \"deviant\" stimulus in a set of perceptually identical \"standards\" (as in the sequence \"s s s s s s s d d s s s s s s d s s s s s d\"). Since the MMN is elicited only in response to a rare \"oddball\" stimulus in a set of other stimuli that are perceived to be the same, it has been used to test how speakers perceive sounds and organize stimuli categorically. For example, a landmark study by Colin Phillips and colleagues used the mismatch negativity as evidence that subjects, when presented with a series of speech sounds with acoustic parameters, perceived all the sounds as either /t/ or /d/ in spite of the acoustic variability, suggesting that the human brain has representations of abstract phonemes—in other words, the subjects were \"hearing\" not the specific acoustic features, but only the abstract phonemes. In addition, the mismatch negativity has been used to study syntactic processing and the recognition of word category.\n\nMany studies in neurolinguistics take advantage of anomalies or \"violations\" of syntactic or semantic rules in experimental stimuli, and analyzing the brain responses elicited when a subject encounters these violations. For example, sentences beginning with phrases such as *\"the garden was on the worked\", which violates an English phrase structure rule, often elicit a brain response called the early left anterior negativity (ELAN). Violation techniques have been in use since at least 1980, when Kutas and Hillyard first reported ERP evidence that semantic violations elicited an N400 effect. Using similar methods, in 1992, Lee Osterhout first reported the P600 response to syntactic anomalies. Violation designs have also been used for hemodynamic studies (fMRI and PET): Embick and colleagues, for example, used grammatical and spelling violations to investigate the location of syntactic processing in the brain using fMRI. Another common use of violation designs is to combine two kinds of violations in the same sentence and thus make predictions about how different language processes interact with one another; this type of crossing-violation study has been used extensively to investigate how syntactic and semantic processes interact while people read or hear sentences.\n\nIn psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, \"priming\" refers to the phenomenon whereby a subject can recognize a word more quickly if he or she has recently been presented with a word that is similar in meaning or morphological makeup (i.e., composed of similar parts). If a subject is presented with a \"prime\" word such as \"doctor\" and then a \"target\" word such as \"nurse\", if the subject has a faster-than-usual response time to \"nurse\" then the experimenter may assume that word \"nurse\" in the brain had already been accessed when the word \"doctor\" was accessed. Priming is used to investigate a wide variety of questions about how words are stored and retrieved in the brain and how structurally complex sentences are processed.\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a new noninvasive technique for studying brain activity, uses powerful magnetic fields that are applied to the brain from outside the head. It is a method of exciting or interrupting brain activity in a specific and controlled location, and thus is able to imitate aphasic symptoms while giving the researcher more control over exactly which parts of the brain will be examined. As such, it is a less invasive alternative to direct cortical stimulation, which can be used for similar types of research but requires that the subject's scalp be removed, and is thus only used on individuals who are already undergoing a major brain operation (such as individuals undergoing surgery for epilepsy). The logic behind TMS and direct cortical stimulation is similar to the logic behind aphasiology: if a particular language function is impaired when a specific region of the brain is knocked out, then that region must be somehow implicated in that language function. Few neurolinguistic studies to date have used TMS; direct cortical stimulation and cortical recording (recording brain activity using electrodes placed directly on the brain) have been used with macaque monkeys to make predictions about the behavior of human brains.\n\nIn many neurolinguistics experiments, subjects do not simply sit and listen to or watch stimuli, but also are instructed to perform some sort of task in response to the stimuli. Subjects perform these tasks while recordings (electrophysiological or hemodynamic) are being taken, usually in order to ensure that they are paying attention to the stimuli. At least one study has suggested that the task the subject does has an effect on the brain responses and the results of the experiment.\n\nThe lexical decision task involves subjects seeing or hearing an isolated word and answering whether or not it is a real word. It is frequently used in priming studies, since subjects are known to make a lexical decision more quickly if a word has been primed by a related word (as in \"doctor\" priming \"nurse\").\n\nMany studies, especially violation-based studies, have subjects make a decision about the \"acceptability\" (usually grammatical acceptability or semantic acceptability) of stimuli. Such a task is often used to \"ensure that subjects [are] reading the sentences attentively and that they [distinguish] acceptable from unacceptable sentences in the way the [experimenter] expect[s] them to do.\"\n\nExperimental evidence has shown that the instructions given to subjects in an acceptability judgment task can influence the subjects' brain responses to stimuli. One experiment showed that when subjects were instructed to judge the \"acceptability\" of sentences they did not show an N400 brain response (a response commonly associated with semantic processing), but that they did show that response when instructed to ignore grammatical acceptability and only judge whether or not the sentences \"made sense\".\n\nSome studies use a \"probe verification\" task rather than an overt acceptability judgment; in this paradigm, each experimental sentence is followed by a \"probe word\", and subjects must answer whether or not the probe word had appeared in the sentence. This task, like the acceptability judgment task, ensures that subjects are reading or listening attentively, but may avoid some of the additional processing demands of acceptability judgments, and may be used no matter what type of violation is being presented in the study.\n\nSubjects may be instructed not to judge whether or not the sentence is grammatically acceptable or logical, but whether the proposition expressed by the sentence is true or false. This task is commonly used in psycholinguistic studies of child language.\n\nSome experiments give subjects a \"distractor\" task to ensure that subjects are not consciously paying attention to the experimental stimuli; this may be done to test whether a certain computation in the brain is carried out automatically, regardless of whether the subject devotes attentional resources to it. For example, one study had subjects listen to non-linguistic tones (long beeps and buzzes) in one ear and speech in the other ear, and instructed subjects to press a button when they perceived a change in the tone; this supposedly caused subjects not to pay explicit attention to grammatical violations in the speech stimuli. The subjects showed a mismatch response (MMN) anyway, suggesting that the processing of the grammatical errors was happening automatically, regardless of attention—or at least that subjects were unable to consciously separate their attention from the speech stimuli.\n\nAnother related form of experiment is the double-task experiment, in which a subject must perform an extra task (such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables) while responding to linguistic stimuli; this kind of experiment has been used to investigate the use of working memory in language processing.\n\nSome relevant journals include the \"Journal of Neurolinguistics\" and \"Brain and Language\". Both are subscription access journals, though some abstracts may be generally available.\n"}

He is one of only five people ever designated an \"Exemplar of Racing\" by the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. He was co-heir to one of America's greatest business fortunes, derived from the Mellon Bank created by his grandfather Thomas Mellon, his father Andrew W. Mellon, and his father's brother Richard B. Mellon. In 1957, when \"Fortune\" prepared its first list of the wealthiest Americans, it estimated that Paul Mellon, his sister Ailsa Mellon-Bruce, and his cousins Sarah Mellon and Richard King Mellon, were all among the richest eight people in the United States, with fortunes of between 400 and 700 million dollars each (around $ and $ in today's dollars).\n\nMellon's autobiography, \"Reflections in a Silver Spoon\", was published in 1992. He died at his home, Oak Spring, in Upperville, Virginia, on February 1, 1999. He was survived by his wife, Rachel (a.k.a. Bunny), his children, Catherine Conover (first wife of John Warner) and Timothy Mellon, and two stepchildren, Stacy Lloyd III and Eliza, Viscountess Moore.\n\nPaul Mellon was the son of Andrew W. Mellon, US Secretary of the Treasury from 1921 to 1932, and Nora McMullen of Hertfordshire and brother of Ailsa Mellon-Bruce. He graduated from The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, in 1925, where he wrote for the literary magazine and composed the school hymn. He then went on to graduate from Yale College and the University of Cambridge. At Yale, he was a member of Chi Psi Fraternity, Scroll and Key and served as vice-chairman of the \"Yale Daily News\". He was a great benefactor of his alma maters, donating to the Forbes-Mellon Library at the University of Cambridge, the Mellon Arts Center and the Mellon (now Icahn) Science Center to Choate, two residential colleges, and the Yale Center for British Art.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale, he went to England to study at the University of Cambridge, receiving a BA in 1931, while his father served as the US Ambassador to the Court of St. James's from 1932 to 1933. In 1930, he was a founding member, alongside Sir Timothy William Gowers, of the CRABS, the Clare Rugby And Boating Society (the oldest of the collegiate Gentlemen's societies still active). In 1938, he received an Oxbridge MA from Clare College, Cambridge. He was a major benefactor to Clare College's Forbes-Mellon Library, opened in 1986.\n\nMellon returned to Pittsburgh, to work for Mellon Bank and other businesses for six months. In 1935, he married Mary Conover Brown and the couple, who had two children, Catherine and Timothy, moved to Virginia.\n\nHe enrolled at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland in 1940 but six months later joined the United States Army, asking to join the cavalry. Mellon served with the Office of Strategic Services in Europe. He rose to the rank of major and was the recipient of four Bronze Stars.\n\nAfter his wife Mary's death in 1946 from an asthma attack, he married Rachel Lambert Lloyd, known as \"Bunny\", the former wife of Stacy Barcroft Lloyd Jr. She was a descendant of the Lambert family who formulated and marketed Listerine and an heiress to the Warner-Lambert corporate fortune (Warner-Lambert is now part of Pfizer, following a 2000 merger). Bunny Mellon was an avid horticulturist and gardener, whose fondness for French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painting, as well as American art, Mellon came to share. By this marriage, he had two stepchildren: Stacy Lloyd III and Eliza Lambert Lloyd (d. 2008; who married and divorced Viscount Moore).\n\nWhile Mellon did not share his father's interest in business, the two found common ground in their love of art and philanthropy. Shortly before Andrew Mellon's death in 1937, construction began on the West Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., for which Andrew Mellon had provided funds. Four years later Paul Mellon presented both the building by John Russell Pope and his father's collection of 115 paintings to the nation. He served on the museum's board for more than four decades: as trustee, as president (twice), as board chair, and as honorary trustee. Mellon commissioned I. M. Pei to build the East Building and, with his sister Ailsa, provided funds for its construction in the late 1970s. Over the years he and his wife Bunny donated more than 1,000 works to the National Gallery, among them many French and American masterworks.\n\nIn 1936, Mellon purchased his first British painting, \"Pumpkin with a Stable-lad\" by George Stubbs, who became a lifetime favorite of Mellon's. Beginning in the late 1950s, with the help of English art historian Basil Taylor, Mellon amassed a major collection by the mid-1960s. London art dealer Geoffrey Agnew once said of his acquisitions: \"It took an American collector to make the English look again at their own paintings.\"\n\nMellon granted his extensive collection of British art, rare books, and related materials to Yale University in the 1960s, along with the funding to create an appropriate museum to house it (designed by Louis Kahn). He characteristically insisted that it not be named in honor of him, but rather would be called the Yale Center for British Art, to encourage others to support it as well. Mellon also provided extensive endowment support to fund not only operations but also an ongoing program of acquisitions, and he made a generous bequest to the Center at the time of his death. The Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art was founded in 1970 through a generous grant to Yale University, as a London-based affiliate of the New Haven center, to encourage study of British art and culture both at the undergraduate and the research scholar levels.\n\nMellon also provided important leadership gifts to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia, as well as Choate Rosemary Hall.\n\nMellon owned many thoroughbred horses under his Rokeby Stables, including Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero. Two of his horses, Arts and Letters and Fort Marcy, were named American Horse of the Year in 1969 and 1970 respectively. Both are inductees in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. He also owned two European champions, Mill Reef and Gold and Ivory. Mill Reef was the #8 rated horse in the world for the 20th Century in \"A Century of Champions\", by John Randall and Tony Morris. Mellon won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Breeder in 1971 and again in 1986.\n\nMellon established the Old Dominion Foundation in 1941 and the Bollingen Foundation in 1945, both to support advancement and learning of the humanities and liberal education. The Bollingen Foundation published over 100 books before closing in 1969, the same year the assets of the Old Dominion Foundation were merged into those of his sister Ailsa's Avalon Foundation. The combined organization was renamed The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in honor of their father.\n\nPaul Mellon's foremost philanthropic interest was his alma mater, Yale University. His most generous and well-known gifts established the Yale Center for British Art, but his legacy makes itself felt across the campus.\n\nMellon's other major gift was to provide extensive funding to support the creation of two new undergraduate residential colleges at Yale, Ezra Stiles College and Morse College. Designed by Eero Saarinen, these colleges along with the Kahn-designed British Art Center demonstrated Mellon's commitment to bringing modern architecture to Yale. Perhaps most importantly, the additional undergraduate capacity that these colleges provided were a critical prerequisite to the ability of the university to transition to co-education.\n\nBeyond these capital gifts, Mellon endowed the deanships of each of Yale's 12 residential colleges. He created the Mellon Senior Forum program, which provides a weekly meal for seniors in each of the residential colleges where they can share progress on their senior essays and projects with one another.\n\nMellon was active in the humanities at Yale. He provided the funding necessary to create the Directed Studies program of intense freshman-year focus on the humanities. He supported significantly the undergraduate theater studies program, and endowed named professorships in schools throughout the University, particularly in the humanities.\n\nMellon was highly supportive of causes that advanced the preservation of horses, including the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation. That organization allocates grants towards specific research projects for the safety, welfare, longevity and improvement of life for race horses.\n\nHe donated the $1 million bonus that Sea Hero won in the Chrysler Triple Crown Challenge to the United States Jockey Club's Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation. Furthermore, he requested that double that amount be raised in response to his donation. That goal was met during the 1995–1996 fiscal year. Upon his death he left yet another $2.5 million to the Foundation's endowment.\n\nIn 1999, Paul Mellon bequeathed $8 million to the University of Cambridge in England for the Fitzwilliam Museum. During his lifetime he agreed that £1 million of that sum could be allocated to the Museum's Courtyard Development and, under the terms of his Will, following his death in 1999, his Executors subsequently allocated a further $12.5 million to complete the renovations associated with the Courtyard, including the re-lighting of all of the Museum's galleries. The remaining balance was added to the Paul Mellon Fund which was established as a trust fund for the Museum at the time of the bequest, the income from which is being used to support education, exhibitions and publications.\n\nHe also helped to buy the 28,625-acre Cape Hatteras National Seashore and the 1,500-acre Sky Meadows State Park in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, where he used to go to look at the stars.\n\nHe was also a major benefactor of Clare College and Clare Hall, both in Cambridge, England. Indeed, Clare Hall, founded 1966, gains much from his benefaction; his generous bequest serves the intellectual needs of the graduate college members. The Mellon Fellowship is another example of his generosity, permitting the reciprocal exchange of two students from Yale and two from Clare College for graduate study in each other's institutions.\n\nHe developed his great love of England and English culture while studying at Clare College from 1929-1931. \"It was while I was at Cambridge that I embarked on the dangerous seas of collecting\", Paul Mellon once said—a statement by the man who described himself as \"the incurable collector\" that has had profound implications for his major beneficiaries, both in the US and the UK.\n\nMellon helped to arrange the merger of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, founded by his father Andrew W. Mellon and uncle Richard B. Mellon with Andrew Carnegie's Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1967 to create Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Additionally, he donated substantial funds to Carnegie Mellon.\n\nPaul Mellon was a trustee of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame and one of the only five people ever designated an \"Exemplar of Racing\" by the Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and the English Jockey Club Hall of Fame.\n\nAmong honors, he was created an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1974, awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1985, and awarded the National Medal of Arts and Humanities in 1997.\n\nIn 1978, Mellon received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48910975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48910975", "title": "Reproductive labor", "text": "Reproductive labor\n\nReproductive labor work often associated with care giving and domestic roles including cleaning, cooking, child care, and the paid domestic labor force. The term has taken on a role in feminist discourse and philosophy as a way of calling to attention to how women in particular are assigned to the domestic sphere where the labor is reproductive and thus uncompensated and unrecognized in a capitalist system. These theories have evolved as a parallel of histories focusing on the entrance of women into the labor force in the 1970s, providing an intersectionalist approach that recognizes that women have been a part of the labor force since before their incorporation into mainstream industry if we consider reproductive labor.\n\nThe division between productive and unproductive labour is stressed by some Marxist feminists including Margaret Benston and Peggy Morton. These theories specify that while productive labor results in goods or services that have monetary value in the capitalist system and are thus compensated by the producers in the form of a paid wage, reproductive labor is associated with the private sphere and involves anything that people have to do for themselves that is not for the purposes of receiving a wage (i.e. cleaning, cooking, having children). These interpretations argue that while both forms of labor are necessary, people have different access to these forms of labor based on certain aspects of their identity.\n\nThese theories argue that both public and private institutions exploit the labor of women as an inexpensive method of supporting a work force. For the producers, this means higher profits. For the nuclear family, the power dynamic dictates that domestic work is exclusively to be completed by the woman of the household thus liberating the rest of the members from their own necessary reproductive labor. Marxist feminists argue that the exclusion of women from productive labor leads to male control in both private and public domains.\n\nThe concept of reproductive labor as it relates to cleaning, cooking, child care, and the paid domestic labor force has been written about and discussed in writing and history prior to the term being codified. This includes works like Virginia Woolf's essay, \"A Room of One's Own\".\n\nFocusing on exclusion from productive labor as the most important source of female oppression, some Marxist feminists devoted their activism to fighting for the inclusion of domestic work within the waged capitalist economy. The idea of creating compensated reproductive labor was present in the writings of socialists such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1898) who argued that women's oppression stemmed from being forced into the private sphere. Gilman proposed that conditions for women would improve when their work was located, recognized, and valued in the public sphere.\n\nPerhaps the most influential of the efforts to compensate reproductive labor was the International Wages for Housework Campaign, an organization launched in Italy in 1972 by members of the International Feminist Collective. Many of these women, including Selma James, Mariarosa Dalla Costa, Brigitte Galtier, and Silvia Federici published a range of sources to promote their message in academic and public domains. Despite the efforts beginning with a relatively small group of women in Italy, The Wages for Housework Campaign was successful in mobilizing on an international level. A Wages for Housework group was founded in Brooklyn, New York with the help of Federici. As Heidi Hartmann acknowledges (1981), the efforts of these movements, though ultimately unsuccessful, generated important discourse regarding the value of housework and its relation to the economy.\n\nUniversal Basic Income has been proposed as a solution.\n\nAnother solution proposed by Marxist feminists is to liberate women from their forced connection to reproductive labor. In her critique of traditional Marxist feminist movements such as the Wages for Housework Campaign, Heidi Hartmann (1981) argues that these efforts \"take as their question the relationship of women to the economic system, rather than that of women to men, apparently assuming the latter will be explained in their discussion of the former.\" Hartmann (1981) believes that traditional discourse has ignored the importance of women's oppression as women, and instead focused on women's oppression as members of the capitalist system. Similarly, Gayle Rubin, who has written on a range of subjects including sadomasochism, prostitution, pornography, and lesbian literature as well as anthropological studies and histories of sexual subcultures, first rose to prominence through her 1975 essay <nowiki>\"</nowiki>\"The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex\"<nowiki>\"</nowiki>, in which she coins the phrase \"sex/gender system\" and criticizes Marxism for what she claims is its incomplete analysis of sexism under capitalism, without dismissing or dismantling Marxist fundamentals in the process.\n\nMore recently, many Marxist feminists have shifted their focus to the ways in which women are now potentially in worse conditions after gaining access to productive labor. Nancy Folbre (1994) proposes that feminist movements begin to focus on women's subordinate status to men both in the reproductive (private) sphere, as well as in the workplace (public sphere). In an interview in 2013, Silvia Federici urges feminist movements to consider the fact that many women are now forced into productive \"and\" reproductive labor, resulting in a \"double day\". Federici (2013) argues that the emancipation of women still cannot occur until they are free from their burdens of unwaged labor, which she proposes will involve institutional changes such as closing the wage gap and implementing child care programs in the workplace. Federici's (2013) suggestions are echoed in a similar interview with Selma James (2012) and these issues have been touched on in recent presidential elections.\n\n"}
{"id": "23791483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23791483", "title": "Rhetoric of social intervention model", "text": "Rhetoric of social intervention model\n\nThe \"rhetoric of social intervention\" (RSI) model is a systemic communication theory of how human beings symbolically constitute, maintain, and change social systems (e.g., organizations, societies, and cultures). The RSI model was developed in the writings of communication theorist William R. Brown. The model provides a framework for analyzing and interpreting social system change and its side effects from a communication perspective. It also suggests a methodology for acting as an intervener to encourage and/or discourage social system change. The model offers an alternative approach to understanding social system change by its emphasis on communication as the driver of change in contrast to models that focus on social, political, economic, and technological forces as catalysts for change. The RSI model is envisioned as three communication subsystems that function as starting points for interpreting or enacting social system change. The subsystems, known as attention, power, and need, form the RSI model framework. This entry describes the assumptive foundations of the RSI model. Then it discusses the attention, power, and need patterns of communication that that model identifies as points for generating social system change and continuity.\n\nThe beginnings of Brown's RSI model are reflected in three main documents—a book about Will Rogers that reports research on American dream ideology, a book chapter that outlines how human beings strategically use symbols to create, maintain, and change symbolic realities, and a journal article in which he sketches the RSI model foundations by theorizing about the process by which human beings strategically use symbols to create, maintain, and change symbolically constructed ideology.\n\n\"Imagemaker: Will Rogers and the American Dream\" was based on Brown's doctoral dissertation. An Oklahoman like Rogers, Brown was curious about Rogers' influence and popularity in the 1920s and 1930s. Brown researched the source of Rogers' ability to be persuasive and authoritative and concluded that it arose from Rogers' ability to embody and reflect characteristics that the U.S. public associated with the American dream. The book describes American dream attributes, such as \"the dream of the dignity and worth of the individual, of freedom and equality, of success, and of progress,\" and shows how Rogers symbolically identified with them. Although Brown acquired an in-depth understanding of American dream ideology, he later reported that the research left him wondering how social systems construct ideology. To address this question, Brown began reading books and articles on language, philosophy, rhetoric, and linguistics.\n\nA book chapter called Language and Strategy, written for \"The Rhetorical Dialogue: Contemporary Concepts and Cases,\" reflects Brown's initial investigations into the process by which human beings symbolically constitute reality, and, by extension, ideology. The chapter describes how human beings learn to categorize experience symbolically and how this symbolizing activity functions rhetorically. Brown draws his ideas for what he calls the \"naming\" process from scholars such as rhetorical theorist Kenneth Burke, philosopher Susanne Langer, psycholinguist Roger Brown, and psychologists Jerome Bruner, Jacqueline Goodnow, and George Austin.\n\nBrown, building on the ideas of Roger Brown, says that human beings learn to name, or to transform experience into symbols, from language tutors, such as parents, peers, educators, and the media. He argues that human beings create names by abstracting from experience and then classifying those abstractions as \"same as\" or \"different from\" other symbolic categorizations for experience. Brown urges that all names are incomplete—as abstractions, they simultaneously direct attention to certain parts of experience and away from other parts of experience.\n\nBrown suggests that all names create expectancies about experience. He argues that this enables human beings to use names rhetorically to clarify ambiguous experience, to suggest approach or avoidance behavior toward experience, and to unite and divide experience. For example, naming a person's actions as \"terrorism\" clarifies the experience, suggests avoidance behavior, and divides that experience from ones named \"guerilla warfare.\"\n\nBrown closes the chapter by outlining what he calls the \"rhetorical reasoning\" process by which human beings advocate for their particular ways of naming experience. The process involves proposing a name, explaining how the name fits the experience, and then suggesting the expected response to experience based on the proposed name. Brown notes that in these discussions, negotiations, agreements, and disagreements about the symbolic classification of experience, human beings create symbolic reality.\n\nIn the article Ideology as Communication Process published in the \"Quarterly Journal of Speech,\" Brown merges his research in ideology and symbolic categorization to propose a model to describe the rhetorical process by which human beings create, maintain, and change ideology, and by extension, social systems. In two later articles, Brown refers to this model as the \"rhetoric of social intervention.\" In the Ideology article, Brown argues that the communication and creation of ideology occur simultaneously and, although a specific ideology might fade, the communication process of constituting, maintaining, and changing ideology is continuous. The RSI model directs attention to the continuous communication process that underlies social change and continuity.\n\nBrown defines ideology as \"any symbolic construction of the world in whose superordinate 'name' human beings can comprehensively order their experience and subsume their specific activities.\" In essence, he views ideology as an ultimate symbolic categorization of all of experience that both creates and is shaped by a social system. Ideology is an overarching name that influences how social system participants make sense of their world, social hierarchy, and needs. At the same time, ideology emerges when participants symbolically constitute worldview, power, and need. For example, according to the RSI model, American dream ideology influences how U.S. Americans interpret their needs and roles in society, e.g., they need \"freedom.\" The actions they take toward achieving \"freedom\" also create American dream ideology. \n\nExtending Roger Brown, the RSI model holds that human beings learn ideology from language tutors. As they learn specific names for experience, they also learn the attributes and expectancies associated with the social system's symbolically constructed ideology. For example, the U.S. social system often identifies attributes such as individualism, freedom, equality, success, and progress with American dream ideology. American dream ideology creates the expectancy that a more perfect life can be achieved by pursuing those attributes. Brown theorizes that human beings construct ideology to meet an inherent human need for an ultimate sense of order, meaning, and explanation for all of experience. Thus, he identifies \"ultimacy\" as the primary attribute of ideology to distinguish it from names given to everyday experience. He writes that ideology is \"that category of experience on which one is willing to bet the meaning of one's life.\"\n\nIn the RSI model, ideology arises out of the naming process. Human beings create ideology by abstracting from and naming sensed and non-sensed experience. The model focuses on the symbolic abstraction process associated with the naming of worldview, relationships, and needs. The model refers to these three symbolic subsystems as attention, power, and need. Brown proposes that the subsystems are holistically interconnected, so that change in one brings about simultaneous change in the other two. Hence, the RSI model provides a systemic, or what Brown later calls an \"holographic,\" approach to understanding social system change.\n\nAccording to the RSI model, bPecause ideology, like all names for experience, is abstractive, all ideologies are incomplete. Brown theorizes that human beings adhere to an ideology as long as it seems to make comprehensive sense of experience. The model predicts that because ideology is always incomplete, adherents will encounter anomalies—experiences that violate or do not fit ideological expectancies. Human beings have an inherent need to avoid a sense of chaos or uncertainty, so they must find a way to account for or make sense of the anomalies to maintain a sense of order and meaning in life. Thus, Brown argues that the symbolic process by which human beings create and maintain ideology is paradoxically the same process that enables them to account rhetorically for the anomalies. He concludes that rhetorical interventions to address anomalies drive social system change. \n\nThe RSI model directs attention to the rhetorical process by which human beings deal with anomalies by focusing on communication patterns associated with the symbolic construction of attention, power, and need. Brown views each of these symbolic subsystems as a starting point for analyzing and initiating communication interventions to promote and impede ideological and, by extension, social system change.\n\nThe Ideology article refers to the attention subsystem as \"input-switching.\" Two later articles call the subsystem \"attention.\" In the RSI model, as human beings symbolically construct ideology, they create complex naming patterns to make sense of and interpret experience. They symbolically constitute templates or worldviews that give meaning to daily experience. They create these complex naming patterns (e.g., a good education will lead to a better life) by abstracting, or paying attention to some aspects of experience (foregrounding) and directing attention away from other aspects (backgrounding). Attention interventions occur when human beings attempt to account for anomalies in their complex naming patterns by communicatively shifting attention. Brown concludes that these rhetorical shifts in attention drive social system change.\n\nIn the Attention and the Rhetoric of Social Intervention article, Brown describes in detail the attention intervention aspect of the RSI model. The RSI model holds that complex naming patterns create expectancies about experience (e.g., that getting a good education will make life better). But when lived experience fails to match the symbolically created expectancy (e.g., a person with a good education cannot find a job), the model suggests that human beings may become more attentive to anomalies in their naming pattern. Furthermore, the more widely human beings apply their naming patterns, the more likely they will encounter anomalies because all naming patterns are abstractions, or incomplete. Because human beings are assumed to have an inherent need for order and to make sense of experience, the model predicts that human beings will attempt to compensate symbolically for these anomalies.\n\nIn the model, human beings communicatively promote or impede \"attention switches\" to compensate for anomalies so as to maintain meaning and order in their lives. Attention switching involves a symbolic recategorizing of experience or a renaming of the expectancies associated with a symbolic category. Attention switching occurs when human beings rhetorically shift what they attend to in experience. For example, instead of foregrounding education as the means to making a better life, they might shift to foregrounding spiritual development as the means to achieve a better life. Alternatively human beings could redefine \"good education\" as meaning only private education instead of all education. In both cases, the RSI model would say that human beings shifted attention to make sense of the anomaly in the \"good education\" template.\n\nAccording to the RSI model, the conditions for an attention switch exist when there are two or more complex naming patterns that can make sense of experience and a systemic shift occurs from one template to another. Attention interventions involve cycles of increased and decreased communication related to anomalies. In the cycle, (1) human beings communicatively increase attention to deviance between symbolically created expectancies and lived experience (anomalies), (2) they increasingly advocate alternative ways of knowing, being, and valuing to account for the anomalies, and (3) their openness to these alternative complex names to regain a sense of order and meaning increases. In the Attention article, Brown demonstrates RSI model concepts by examining the symbolic creation of the scientific worldview. He also applies the RSI model to identify attention switch cycles that generated social system shifts in U.S. black/white relationships from 1919-1965.\n\nThe RSI model suggests that to promote an attention switch, interveners (persons attempting to bring about or prevent social change) communicatively feature attention to anomalies in currently held complex names. They advocate an alternative template that foregrounds aspects of experience that had been backgrounded in the currently held complex name. Their symbols mask attention to anomalies in the proposed naming pattern. Interveners that are attempting to prevent social system change communicatively feature attention to anomalies in the proposed template and mask attention to anomalies in the currently held naming pattern.\n\nDuring an attention switch, experience itself is assumed not to change. What changes is how human beings symbolically categorize the experience. Although experience does not change, the RSI model suggests that it appears different because of concurrent shifts in interpretations of power and need. The shift to a new worldview brings about corresponding shifts in symbolic categorizations of needs and power relationships as well as an alternative social system future.\n\nThe RSI model predicts that after human beings shift attention to a new naming pattern, they eventually will also encounter anomalies in that pattern itself because all naming patterns are incomplete. The cycle of attention switching will begin again. Thus, although the content of a naming pattern may change, the communication process of creating, maintaining and changing naming patterns is continuous.\n\nIn the RSI model, the attention subsystem is one starting point for the rhetorical analysis of or the intervention in social system change. Alternatively, social change can also be examined from the starting point of the symbolic construction of power.\n\nThe Ideology article refers to the power subsystem as \"interpersonal categorizing.\" Two later articles call the subsystem \"power.\" In the RSI model, human beings are interdependent with others in the symbolic construction and sharing of needs and power. The model holds that social systems arise out of the naming of relationships. Human beings interpersonally categorize to create and reify roles, social hierarchy, and relationship rules. In creating social order, human beings also create ideology. At the same time, ideology influences the social system participants' assumptions about social hierarchy. Power interventions occur when human beings attempt to account for anomalies in symbolically created hierarchy. These rhetorical interventions drive social system change and continuity.\n\nIn the Power and the Rhetoric of Social Intervention article, Brown describes in detail the power intervention aspect of the RSI model. Brown defines power as the degree to which human beings feel interdependent with others in fulfilling needs and in choosing futures. In the RSI model, human beings form power-sharing social systems in which they share responsibility for meeting needs and making choices that shape the social system's future. The RSI model treats power as a communication medium that provides rules or power codes for taking actions and/or making decisions without deliberation. Brown posits that relational names communicate what sociologist Niklas Luhmann calls \"power codes\" that shape relationship participants' choices and behaviors. For example, in the relational name \"teacher/student,\" students typically choose to follow the teacher's direction, such as doing homework, because of social system expectancies associated with that relationship. At the same time, teachers usually follow the social system's expected rules for behavior, such as treating all students fairly.\n\nAccording to the model, human beings create power through communication by symbolically constituting relationships. They create relationships by naming people as \"same as\" or \"different from\" each other and acting as if those similarities and differences are real and have meaning. As human beings learn relational names from language tutors, they learn expectancies the social system associates with those names. Thus, in the model, relational names are non-sensed or symbolic abstractions, which human beings make real in how they behave toward others and in objects created to represent relational names. For example, the stripes on a person's shirt and the social expectation that this person will salute officers make real the symbolic category \"sergeant.\" \n\nThe RSI model holds that social hierarchy arises out of naming relationships \"same\" and \"different.\" In the model, relational names that emphasize similarities between self and other are called \"complementary\" (e.g., friends, coworkers). These names convey the expectancy of equality. Relational names that emphasize differences are called \"reciprocal\" (e.g., winner/loser, coach/player). These names convey the expectancy of inequality. Social hierarchy is composed of complementary and reciprocal relationships. The social hierarchy becomes a symbolic reality when human beings act as if these relationships are real and that their expectancies have power.\n\nAccording to the model, when expectancies associated with relational names are violated, conditions for a power intervention exist. For example, if the teacher does not treat students fairly, the students might attempt a power intervention by complaining to the teacher's superior or by dropping the class. More specifically, power interventions involve cycles of attention shifts from cooperation to maintain the current social hierarchy to competition by offering an alternative hierarchy, and vice versa. In the cycle, (1) human beings communicatively increase attention to anomalies in social hierarchy, (2) they increasingly advocate alternative ways of social organizing based on exchange, threat, or integry, and (3) they become more open to alternative social hierarchies to regain social order. Human beings attribute motives in the choice to cooperate or challenge social hierarchy. Brown draws upon economist Kenneth Boulding's ideas about social organizers to suggest motives that human beings attribute to relationships—exchange, threat, and integry. For example, human beings cooperate because they expect something in return (exchange). They cooperate because they expect a negative outcome if they do not cooperate (threat). They cooperate because of an interpretation of shared human identity (integry).\n\nLike attention interventions, power interventions occur in communication interactions. The RSI model suggests that to encourage a power shift, interveners communicatively create social disorder by foregrounding anomalies in the current social hierarchy template. They advocate alternative ways of social organizing as the means to regain social order. To prevent a power shift and maintain the current social hierarchy, interveners communicatively foreground anomalies in the proposed template. They advocate ways to account for the anomalies in the current template. They attempt to dissuade openness to alternative ways of social organizing. In both cases, Brown concludes that communication drives social system change and continuity.\n\nBecause social hierarchy is a symbolic abstraction, it will always be incomplete and imperfect. As human beings shift from one social hierarchy to another, the newly adopted hierarchy will one day appear non-needs meeting. Thus, in the model, a continuous cycle of power shifts occur from cooperation to competition and vice versa in the symbolic creation of power. In the Power article, Brown traces social hierarchy shifts in black/white relationships from the 1910s to the 1970s through the lens of the RSI model. He also examines the power intervention strategies, tactics, and maneuvers of New York urban planner Robert Moses to demonstrate RSI model concepts.\n\nThe RSI model predicts that shifts in the symbolic categorization of power also result in need and attention shifts. Attention shifts occur as human beings pay attention to different aspects of experience to promote or prevent power shifts. Need interventions occur as shifts in power result in changes in interpretations of needs. As with the attention subsystem, the model views the power subsystem as one entry point for analyzing and intervening in social system change. Alternatively, social system change can be examined from the perspective of the need subsystem.\n\nThe Ideology article refers to the need subsystem as \"intrapersonal categorizing.\" Two later articles call the subsystem \"need.\" In the RSI model, human beings have an innate need for a sense of order in self—to know who they are, their role in society, and who and what around them is important and meaningful. Social systems construct ideology to satisfy that need, just as the constructed ideology shapes how social system participants interpret their needs. Need interventions occur when human beings attempt to account for anomalies in their symbolically constructed interpretations of needs.\n\nMore specifically, the RSI model holds that human beings have two types of needs: biosocial and symbolic. Biosocial needs are innate needs, necessary for growth and survival, which are expressed in communication (e.g., when a person says, \"I need water\" to fulfill a biological need for water). Symbolic needs are those constituted by communication (e.g., when a person says, \"I need Brand X water\" because advertisers have persuaded the person to interpret Brand X as better meeting the need for health than tap water). In both cases, human beings create interdependencies with others to fulfill biosocial and symbolic needs. They learn from language tutors the social system's assumptions about what needs are important and how needs should be communicated and satisfied.\n\nBrown draws upon social anthropologist Edmund Leach's idea of code-switching to explain how human beings create needs symbolically. Leach writes that human beings talk and act as if non-sensed or abstract concepts exist in the physical world (e.g., marriage, prosperity, recession), having \"forgotten\" that they symbolically constructed these concepts. They code switch, or act as if the non-sensed is now the sensed.\n\nNeed interventions involve cycles of increased and decreased communication to anomalies in symbolic constructions of needs. Brown theorizes that need interventions involve cycles that alternate between attributing and denying individual- and group-oriented needs. In the cycle, (1) human beings communicatively increase awareness or attention to unmet or attributed/denied needs, (2) they increase advocacy behavior toward those perceived as being able to meet the need, and (3) they become more open to those who can respond to attributed or denied need.\n\nThe model predicts that once a particular need has been fulfilled, then attention to that particular need decreases, advocacy behavior decreases, and openness to others decreases. At the same time, attention to \"new\" needs increases. In addition, if a need goes unmet and the human beings advocating the need continually encounter non-needs meeting responses, they might begin advocating the need in ways that the social system names as inappropriate (e.g., shifting from protests to setting buildings on fire). Alternatively, the needs advocates might rename the need in a way that diminishes its urgency and shift attention to other needs. \n\nAccording to the model, to promote a shift in needs, an intervener communicatively increases attention to how current needs are not being met or how needs expectancies are unfulfilled. Then the intervener advocates an alternative interpretation of needs and shows how it makes better sense of experience in the attempt to increase others' openness to this needs proposal. To prevent a shift in needs, an intervener foregrounds anomalies in the proposed interpretation of needs. Then the intervener advocates a way to account for anomalies in the currently existing interpretation of needs to attempt to maintain the current interpretation of needs. In both cases, communication drives social system change and continuity.\n\nBecause the RSI model is systemic, the need subsystem is assumed to be interconnected with the power and attention subsystems. Thus, as interpretations of needs change, so do interpretations of power relationships within the social system. In addition, attention shifts occur when the social system emphasizes different types of needs (individual or group)\n\nAlthough Brown presents the RSI model as three subsystems, he theorizes that social system intervention is an holistic process that involves all three subsystems simultaneously. He explains that human beings' linear language limits their ability to talk about all three subsystems concurrently. Thus, when analyzing or enacting interventions, human beings tend to emphasize one subsystem and background the other two. The RSI model treats the shifts in the backgrounded subsystems as \"side effects\" of the primary subsystem intervention.\n\nIn addition, in the RSI model, all social system interventions involve multiple interveners. Brown notes, though, that the linear nature of language often results in human beings acting as if one person or group is the primary intervener. The RSI model suggests that all social system change attempts are influenced simultaneously by interveners communicating to promote change and interveners communicating to impede change.\n\nBrown names his model \"social intervention\" to emphasize his conclusion that any attempt to encourage or discourage social system change is an intervention, not control or manipulation. He argues that the interconnected nature of the subsystems and the communication actions of multiple interveners mean that the outcome of any attempted system change evidences multi-causation. Thus, Brown views social intervention as a communication act that attempts to \"nudge\" a social system toward or away from a particular way of naming worldview, power, and needs.\n\nOverall, the RSI model is conceived of as a framework for analyzing and tracking the communication patterns that generate social system change and continuity. It also can be viewed as a methodology to guide efforts to promote and/or prevent social system change.\n\nBrown's publications on the RSI model:\nPublication that summarizes the RSI model:\nPublications that apply and/or extend the RSI model:\n"}

Four years after \"The Carol Burnett\" show ended, the TV-movie-special \"Eunice\" (the character of Mama's daughter) was broadcast. The special included the key characters from \"The Family\" sketches, including Mama. The skit turned movie was spun off for a third time with a sitcom that surrounded the \"Mama\" character. \"Mama's Family\" has two contrasting lives. This is as result of the show's cancellation from NBC after one and a half seasons (1983 to 1984). In 1986, the program was relaunched in first-run syndication, where it enjoyed a highly successful second life all the way to its series finale in 1990.\n\nBy the \"Mama\" character's full development on the second life of \"Mama's Family\", Thelma had spent much of her time tending to the housework and nurturance of her loved ones, constantly engaged in cooking, cleaning, and providing loving support to her family. She ruled the roost with a smart mouth and snappy retorts; an explosively quick temper; and a brash, rough and abrasive manner. Mama solved most of her problems with a can of Budweiser; a purse whack; an object slam; a shove; a startling shout; and a healthy dose of wisecracking insults and criticisms.\"\n\nCarol Burnett was originally supposed to play the \"Mama\" character while Lawrence was to play her daughter, but because of Burnett's desire to swap roles, Lawrence played Mama. In her autobiography, Vicki called Thelma \"the only role which I got to go to makeup to get ugly!\" It is Lawrence's most well-known role.\n\nMama's appearance is based on that of a stereotypical elderly woman. She is a buxom, pursed-lipped widow, with silvery blue curls. All of her outfits have consisted of various short-sleeved, floral-print dresses that carry lace collars. As much of Mama's time on \"Mama's Family\" was spent cooking and cleaning, her dresses were often worn with an overlapping apron. Mama's lower legs have been clasped by visible support hose since the outset of \"Mama's Family\"; she wore no support hose during \"The Family\" sketches nor the \"Eunice\" movie. For footwear, Mama has invariably worn white, orthopedic shoes of a high heeled brogue style.\n\nMama has also invariably worn a few fashion accessories: a white pearl necklace and white pearl earrings. \nMama's outerwear has always consisted of the same purple sweater, worn casually, draped over her shoulders without arms in the sleeves; inconstant floral headpieces; and a white purse, which she didn't hesitate to use as a weapon when given the opportunity.\n\nThe persona of the \"Mama\" character was revolutionized as between \"The Family\" sketches and the first life of \"Mama's Family\". Lawrence recognized the modifications early on and disapproved. She has revealed that she originally found the softening of the \"Mama\" character to be unfunny. However, Lawrence has stated that after counsel about the character needing reshaping to fit sitcom television from Harvey Korman (played the \"Ed\" character), she came to accept and later embrace the adjusted version of Mama. She has stated that to this day, she appreciates how the character has \"blossomed\" and \"matured\" from \"The Family\" sketches. The original writers of the character had based Mama on their real-life family members and thus disapproved of the adjustments.\n\nThe character of \"Mama\" was originally based, at least in part, on the relationship between Carol Burnett's mother and grandmother and was intended to be a maternal, elderly version of Eunice. Lawrence has noted that she also used her southern ex-mother-in-law and her own grandmother from Missouri in the genesis of Mama.\n\nUnlike the sketches and the television movie, Mama had several locutions in the sitcom. Her most frequently used locution in the series is \"Good Lord!\" also occasionally stated in alternate ways, such as \"Good Lord in heaven!\" or \"Good night Louise!\" Among her other locutions included \"Now hear this!\" \"Hell's bells!\" \"God-awful!\" \"The hell you say,\" \"Smut,\" \"For heaven's sake!\" \"For crying out loud!\" \"In a pig's eye,\" \"Shoot!\" \"Real good,\" \"Oh I bet the neightbors are just lovin' this.\" etc. Thelma also had a series of name-calling catch phrases she often used to refer to certain members of her family or her family as a whole, such as \"Nitwit,\" \"Dimwit,\" \"Goon,\" \"Goober Goon,\" \"Lamebrain,\" \"Dunce,\" \"Tramp,\" etc.\n\nUnlike the ill-tempered and stormy personalities alongside Mama in \"The Family\" sketches and the assertive and forceful personalities in the first life of \"Mama's Family\", the supporting characters in the second life of \"Mama's Family\" weren't nearly as quarrelsome or assertive. Due to the supporting characters being more easily subjugated and Mama's own adjustments, the second life of \"Mama's Family\" was much more lighthearted, less serious, and less contentious than all previous Thelma & family broadcasts. There are some moments, though, in the show's second life in which the supporting characters band together against Mama with petulant complaints and finger-pointing, causing heated arguments to ensue.\n\nIn \"The Family\" sketches, Thelma and her late husband, Carl Harper, have five children: Ellen, Eunice, Phillip, Larry, and Jack. This created marked plotholes as in the \"Eunice\" TV movie, they have three children: Ellen, Eunice, and Phillip. In \"Mama's Family\", they have three children, but the character of Phillip is replaced by Vinton. Thelma's husband, Carl, is a deceased character in all three broadcasts. He's only present in flashbacks as an unseen character, portrayed in voice only. In the movie \"Eunice\" Carl was voiced by Dick Clair and was heard from the main floor bathroom. Thelma is in her late sixties during \"Mama's Family.\" (Vicki Lawrence was in her thirties during this time and would not turn sixty until 2009.)\n\nThelma's squabbles, resulting from her ingratitude and spite for her daughter Eunice and Eunice's husband, Ed, was the ongoing theme of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nIn \"Mama's Family\", Thelma lived originally with her sister, newspaper writer Fran Crowley. In the first episode, Vinton and his two children, Vinton \"Buzz\" Harper Jr. and Sonja Harper, move in with Thelma after being evicted from their house. Vinton has just gone through a divorce from a woman named Mitzi, who moved to Las Vegas to become a cocktail waitress.\n\nVinton soon marries Naomi Harper, Thelma's next door neighbor, whom Thelma despises. Thelma becomes so enraptured and relieved to find out Naomi, Vint and the kids are going to move to Arizona to run a trailer park, that she consents to having them marry in her living room. Following the wedding, they all return to Thelma's house to stay because Naomi's partner in the trailer park venture has absconded with every cent of Vint and Naomi's life's savings and had never actually owned a trailer park.\n\nThelma's relationships with her grandchildren are different than those with her children. She gets along rather well with Buzz, since he isn't always worrying her into the grave, the way his older sister does and Thelma's own children had done when they were younger.\n\nThelma is best friends with her neighbor across the street, Iola Boylan, who is crazy about Vinton and agrees with Thelma that Naomi wasn't the right kind of wife for him. In fact, Iola, who did not appear in the NBC episodes but makes her debut in the first episode of the third season, thinks she would be Vint's perfect mate. Thelma and Iola spend a great deal of time together, and Iola often comes over for dinner when she isn't helping her eccentric and infirmed parents. Although they are best friends, Iola and Thelma \"do\" have their share of disagreements as well, most of which are instigated by outside forces.\n\nAfter Buzz and Sonja move out of the house for parts unknown and Fran dies in 1986, Thelma is joined by her other grandson, Bubba, Eunice and Ed's son. Her relationship with him is vastly different from the one she had with Buzz. Bubba is his mother's son, and while not as contentious and selfish as Eunice was, he is just as headstrong and stubborn, although he matured as the series progressed. He makes no fan of his Uncle Vint and Aunt Naomi when he is given Fran's old bedroom, meaning their bedroom will remain in the basement. Thelma did this because she wanted his bedroom to be next to hers, enabling her to keep better watch over him. However, with Bubba's parents having left him in Raytown while moving to Florida without telling him, Vint and Naomi were not about to begrudge him a bedroom.\n\nThelma has a very strong aversion to her grandchildren drinking to excess. In one instance, when Bubba comes home drunk after several beers, she punished him harshly. At first, nobody in her family understands why, considering that she regularly drinks beer, until Iola tells everyone about a terrible situation with Bubba's mother, Eunice. During a Mother-Daughter banquet several years before, presumably in the 1950s, Eunice showed up quite intoxicated. Then, during a song, Eunice and Thelma started having a violent argument on stage, during which Mama revealed to everyone present the circumstances under which Eunice was conceived. (Mama: \"If your daddy hadn't gotten me as drunk as you are now, you never would have been!\") Such a statement might explain the rancor between Thelma and Eunice. Taking the story to heart, Bubba swears off beer from that point forward.\n\nThelma's embattled relationship with Eunice was not unlike the somewhat contentious relationship she had with her own mother. In her mind, Thelma's mother had no liking for anything Thelma did. In an episode where she deals with her own austere mother who haunts her for entertaining the idea of selling her brooch, Thelma calls her the same epithet that Eunice sometimes uses on her: \"Old lady\". At the end of the episode, Thelma's mother's haunting ends when Thelma sells the brooch, and then screams at her mother's apparition, \"Get the hell out of my life!\"\n\nThelma has held various jobs in Raytown. She works with Meals on Wheels; had a short stint as Mayor of Raytown, worked at a travel agency (for less than a day), worked at the local grocery store, \"Food Circus\", went to night school and also worked at a fast food restaurant.\n\nOne of Thelma's lifelong dreams is to go to Hawaii. She gets her wish when she appears on \"Jeopardy!\" While Thelma loses the main part of the competition, she does win a Hawaiian vacation as a consolation prize. The next two-part episode features Thelma, Iola, Vint, Naomi and Bubba's adventures in Hawaii.\n\nAs a former president of the Church Ladies League, Thelma has to deal with the ladies of the church, including the gossipy pastor's wife, Alberta Meechum, who brazenly tries to break up Thelma and Iola's friendship by suggesting that Iola run for president of the CLL. (Mrs. Meechum did this because Thelma had helped Alberta's husband spank their grandson, Little Eugene, for causing trouble for the Harpers and for kicking her husband in his sore leg. In her mind, Little Eugene was an angel, and helping to hurt him was a huge \"no-no\".) Neither Thelma nor Iola wins and Thelma's eventual successor is a woman named Lolly Perdue (first played by Doris Hess and later Marge Redmond), who wins because she was the only person big enough to separate the squabbling Thelma and Iola. Some time later, Lolly is the target of an impeachment attempt by Thelma and Iola, but they end up backing down when they discover Lolly is illiterate. Thelma also has to contend with Reverend Lloyd Meechum, the man who married Vint and Naomi. She also babysat their grandson, a little demon named Eugene, with disastrous results.\n\nThelma was known for her somewhat uneasy relations with her neighbors, going back to when Naomi lived next door. Most of her neighbors wouldn't mind seeing her and her entire dysfunctional family move away and never come back. A large part of this animosity came about during an aborted attempt to knock down the neighborhood and replace it with a landfill. To Thelma's shock, the house she had lived in since she was married had once been a brothel where the town's founder, James A. Ray, died. Thus, it was made a Raytown historical landmark, to mayor Alvin Tutweiler's chagrin, and her neighbors ire. They wanted a lot of money to leave that neighborhood and lose Thelma as a neighbor, but it was not to be. Even Iola was irate.\n\nLawrence has resurrected the character of Thelma (still in her late sixties) several times on the game show \"Hollywood Squares\", on stage in her two-woman show, on her talk show in the early 1990s, on the TNN talk show Primetime Country and in the 2008 TV Land Awards, and on numerous comedy tours.\n\nThelma \"wrote\" a book in 2008 entitled \"Mama for President\".\n\nThelma also appeared on \"Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?\" on October 2, 2009 playing for charity. She ended up winning $8,000 USD, getting nine out of ten questions correct, and opted not to answer the eleventh question (the bonus question), as missing that question results in a loss of all the player's winnings.\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Thelma was seen once again on Logo's \"\" as the special comedian in which the contestants had to interact and have a comedic sketch. Later seen out of the Thelma persona, Vicki Lawrence played as a special guest judge to the contestants alongside RuPaul.\n\nOn February 5, 2013, Thelma appeared in a special sketch during \"Betty White's 2nd Annual 90th Birthday\" in honor of Betty White. The sketch features a Beverly Hills high school class reunion with three of Betty's \"classmates\" from 1939. The sketch has a run time just over two minutes.\n\nMeTV's insertion of \"Mama's Family\" into their 2015–2016 schedule also brought with it several new video spots of Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, used for bumpers and promotional commercials on the network.\n"}
{"id": "249415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249415", "title": "Tintern Abbey", "text": "Tintern Abbey\n\nTintern Abbey ( ) was founded by Walter de Clare, Lord of Chepstow, on 9 May 1131. It is situated adjacent to the village of Tintern in Monmouthshire, on the Welsh bank of the River Wye, which at this point forms the border between Monmouthshire in Wales and Gloucestershire in England. It was only the second Cistercian foundation in Britain (after Waverley Abbey), and the first in Wales. The abbey fell into ruin after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. Its remains have been celebrated in poetry and painting from the 18th century onwards. In 1984 Cadw took over responsibility for the site. The site welcomes approximately 70,000 people every year.\n\nWalter de Clare, of the powerful family of Clare, was first cousin of William Giffard, Bishop of Winchester, who had introduced the first colony of Cistercians to Waverley, Surrey, in 1128. The monks for Tintern came from a daughter house of Cîteaux, L'Aumône Abbey, in the diocese of Chartres in France. In time, Tintern established two daughter houses, Kingswood in Gloucestershire (1139) and Tintern Parva, west of Wexford in southeast Ireland (1203).\n\nThe Cistercian monks (or White Monks) who lived at Tintern followed the Rule of Saint Benedict. The \"Carta Caritatis\" (Charter of Love) laid out their basic principles, of obedience, poverty, chastity, silence, prayer, and work. With this austere way of life, the Cistercians were one of the most successful orders in the 12th and 13th centuries. The lands of the Abbey were divided into agricultural units or granges, on which local people worked and provided services such as smithies to the Abbey. Many endowments of land on both sides of the Wye were made to the Abbey.\n\nThe present-day remains of Tintern are a mixture of building works covering a 400-year period between 1136 and 1536. Very little remains of the first buildings; a few sections of walling are incorporated into later buildings and the two recessed cupboards for books on the east of the cloisters are from this period. The church of that time was smaller than the present building and was slightly to the north. \n\nDuring the 13th century the Abbey was mostly rebuilt; first the cloisters and the domestic ranges, then finally the great church between 1269 and 1301. The first mass in the rebuilt presbytery was recorded to have taken place in 1288, and the building was consecrated in 1301, although building work continued for several decades. Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, the then lord of Chepstow, was a generous benefactor; his monumental undertaking was the rebuilding of the church. The Abbey put his coat of arms in the glass of its east window in thanks to him.\n\nIt is this great abbey church that is seen today. It has a cruciform plan with an aisled nave; two chapels in each transept and a square ended aisled chancel. The Decorated Gothic church represents the architectural developments of its day. The abbey is built of Old Red Sandstone, of colours varying from purple to buff and grey. Its total length from east to west is 228 feet, while the transept is 150 feet in length.\n\nIn 1326 King Edward II stayed at Tintern for two nights. In 1349 the Black Death swept the country and it became impossible to attract new recruits for the lay brotherhood. Changes to the way the granges were tenanted out rather than worked by lay brothers show that Tintern was short of labour. In the early 15th century Tintern was short of money, due in part to the effects of the Welsh uprising under Owain Glyndŵr against the English kings, when Abbey properties were destroyed by the Welsh rebels. The closest battle to the abbey was at Craig-y-dorth near Monmouth, between Trellech and Mitchel Troy.\n\nIn the reign of King Henry VIII, his Dissolution of the Monasteries ended monastic life in England, Wales and Ireland. On 3 September 1536, Abbot Wych surrendered Tintern Abbey and all its estates to the King's visitors and ended a way of life that had lasted 400 years. Valuables from the Abbey were sent to the royal Treasury and Abbot Wych was pensioned off. The building was granted to the then lord of Chepstow, Henry Somerset, 2nd Earl of Worcester. Lead from the roof was sold and the decay of the buildings began.\n\nIn the next two centuries little or no interest was shown in the history of the site. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the ruins were inhabited by workers in the local wire works. However, in the mid-18th century it became fashionable to visit \"wilder\" parts of the country. The Wye Valley in particular was well known for its romantic and picturesque qualities and the ivy clad Abbey became frequented by tourists. One of the earliest prints of the Abbey was in the series of engravings of historical sites made in 1732 by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck. After the publication of the book \"Observations on the River Wye\" by the Reverend William Gilpin following his 1770 tour, visitors greatly increased, a fact evidenced both by the number of poetic descriptions and of atmospheric paintings and prints of the site.\n\nA dedicatory letter at the start of Gilpin’s work is addressed to the poet William Mason and mentions a similar tour made in 1771 by the poet Thomas Gray. Neither of those dedicated a poem to the Abbey, but it appeared in the work of a number of others, including Rev. Dr. Syned Davies’ long “Describing a Voyage to Tintern Abbey, in Monmouthshire, from Whitminster in Gloucestershire”, which was made by boat with a party of others as early as 1745. Another topographical work, the six-canto \"Chepstow; or, A new guide to gentlemen and ladies whose curiosity leads them to visit Chepstow: Piercefield-walks, Tintern-abbey, and the beautiful romantic banks of the Wye, from Tintern to Chepstow by water\", was published from Bristol in 1786. There was also the “Poetical description of Tintern Abbey” by the parson poet Rev. Duncomb Davis, who lived locally and furnished it with many historical and topical discursions, including the method of iron-making that took place adjacent to the site. This appeared in two guide books, the most popular of which was Charles Heath's \"Historical and Descriptive Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of Tintern Abbey\", that went through many editions from 1793 onwards.\n\nWilliam Wordsworth’s poem \"Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey, on revisiting the banks of the Wye during a tour, July 13, 1798\", is often linked with the Abbey, although it does not actually mention the ruins. Instead, it recalls an earlier visit five years before and comments on the beneficial internalisation of that memory. Following a similar walking tour with friends, Robert Bloomfield also dedicated a long poem to “The Banks of the Wye” (1811) in which the Abbey is only mentioned briefly as one of many items on the way. However, that was followed in 1825 by yet another long poem dealing with the area, annotated and in four books, by Edward Collins: \"Tintern Abbey or the Beauties of Piercefield\" (1825). \nEdward Jerningham’s earlier short lyric, “Tintern Abbey”, written in 1796, followed Gilpin, whom he quoted, in commenting on the mournful lesson of the past. Two poems of about that time also moralised on a visit to the ruins. Edmund Gardner, in his “Sonnet written in Tintern Abbey”, concludes with the line that 'Man’s but a temple of a shorter date', while Luke Booker, in his “Original sonnet composed on leaving Tintern Abbey and proceeding with a party of friends down the River Wye to Chepstow”, hopes at death to sail as peacefully to the 'eternal Ocean'. Richard Monckton Milnes' sonnet on “Tintern Abbey” dates from 1840. It is also known that Tennyson’s “Tears, Idle Tears” (1847) was composed on a visit, but no mention of the Abbey appears there and the poem refers to personal feelings.\nIn 1816, the abbey was made the backdrop to Sophia F. Ziegenhirt’s three-volume novel of Gothic horror, \"The Orphan of Tintern Abbey\", dismissed by \"The Monthly Review\" as “of the most ordinary class, in which the construction of the sentences and that of the story are equally confused.” In a much more successful novel published two years earlier, Jane Austen described the decorations of Fanny Price's sitting room at Mansfield Park that included three fashionable transparencies, one of which featured the Abbey.\n\nGilpin’s work on the Wye dealt not simply with the picturesque as a pictorial quality but with the added appeal of Gothic associations, as in the case of Tintern Abbey. The visiting artists Francis Towne (1777), Thomas Gainsborough (1782), Thomas Girtin (1793), and J.M.W. Turner in the 1794–95 series now at the Tate and the British Museum, depicted details of the Abbey's stonework. So did Samuel Palmer (see Gallery) and Thomas Creswick in the 19th century.\n\nCharles Heath, in his 1793 guide, commented on the picturesque quality of light in the \"inimitable\" effect of the harvest moon shining through the main window. Once the railway arrived in 1876, steam excursions to the site were organised in the 1880s to Tintern station at that season to view the moon through the rose window. Decades earlier, Peter van Lerberghe’s interior of 1812, with its tourist guides carrying burning torches, showed the abbey lit by these and by moonlight (see Gallery). Paintings of the abbey at a distance include John Warwick Smith’s 1779 moonlit scene of the ruins, sunsets by Samuel Palmer and Benjamin Williams Leader, and the later colour study by Turner in which the building appears as what Matthew Imms describes as a \"dark shape at the centre\" beneath slanting sunlight (see Gallery).\n\nThe area adjacent to the abbey became industrialised from the mid-16th century with the setting up of the first wireworks by the Company of Mineral and Battery Works and the later expansion of factories and furnaces up the Angidy valley. Charcoal was made in the woods to feed these operations and, in addition, the hillside above the Abbey was quarried for the making of lime at a kiln in constant operation for some two centuries. The site was in consequence subject to a degree of pollution and the ruins themselves were inhabited by the local workers. J.T.Barber, for example, remarked on “passing the works of an iron foundry and a train of miserable cottages engrafted on the offices of the Abbey” on his approach.\nUntil the 19th century, the local roads were rough and dangerous and the easiest access to the site was by boat. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, while trying to reach Tintern from Chepstow on a tour with friends in 1795, almost rode his horse over the edge of a quarry when they became lost in the dark. It was not until 1829 that the new Wye Valley turnpike was completed, cutting through the abbey precinct. In 1876 the Wye Valley Railway opened a station for Tintern. Although the line itself crossed the river before reaching the village, a branch was built from it to the wire works, obstructing the view of the Abbey on the road approach from the north.\n\nNot all tourists were shocked by the intrusion of industry, however. Joseph Cottle and Robert Southey set out to view the ironworks at midnight on their 1795 tour, while others painted or sketched them during the following years. A 1799 print of the Abbey by Edward Dayes includes the boat-landing near the ruins and some of the encroaching housing. In the background above are the cliffs of a lime quarry and smoke rising from the kiln (see the Gallery). Though Philip James de Loutherbourg’s 1805 painting of the ruins does not include the intrusive buildings commented on by others, it makes their inhabitants and animals a prominent feature. Even William Havell’s panorama of the valley from the south pictures smoke rising in the distance, much as Wordsworth had noted five years before “wreathes of smoke sent up in silence from among the trees” in his description of the scene.\n\nIn the 20th century ruined abbeys became the focus for scholars, and architectural and archaeological investigations were undertaken. In 1901 the Abbey was bought by the crown from the Duke of Beaufort for £15,000. It was recognised as a monument of national importance and repair and maintenance works began to be carried out. In 1914 the Office of Works was passed responsibility for the ruins, and major structural repairs and partial reconstructions were undertaken — the ivy considered so romantic by the early tourists was removed. In 1984 Cadw took over responsibility for the site, which was Grade I listed from 29 September 2000. The arch of the Abbey's watergate, which led from the Abbey to the River Wye, still exists today as part of the nearby Anchor Inn. The watergate arch was also Grade II listed from 29 September 2000.\n\nAmerican poet Allen Ginsberg took an acid trip at Tintern Abbey on 28 July 1967, and wrote his poem \"Wales Visitation\" as a result. In the poem he wrote of:\n<poem>\n...the lambs on the tree-nooked hillside this day bleating\nheard in Blake's old ear, & the silent thought of Wordsworth in eld Stillness\nclouds passing through skeleton arches of Tintern Abbey—\nBard Nameless as the Vast, babble to Vastness!</poem>\n\nThe Abbey is the setting for both the 1969 Flirtations music video \"Nothing But A Heartache\" and the 1988 Iron Maiden video \"Can I Play with Madness\".\n\nGordon Masters' historical novel \"The Secrets of Tintern Abbey\" (2008) dramatises the turbulent 400-year history of the Cistercian community at the Abbey.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2983685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2983685", "title": "Typology (archaeology)", "text": "Typology (archaeology)\n\nIn archaeology a typology is the result of the classification of things according to their physical characteristics. The products of the classification, i.e. the classes, are also called types. Most archaeological typologies organize portable artifacts into types, but typologies of larger structures, including buildings, field monuments, fortifications or roads, are equally possible. A typology helps to manage a large mass of archaeological data. According to Doran and Hodson, \"this superficially straightforward task has proved one of the most time consuming and contentious aspects of archaeological research\".\n\nTypology is based on a view of the world familiar from Plato's metaphysics called essentialism. Essentialism is the idea that the world is divided into real, discontinuous and immutable ‘kinds’. This idea is the basis for most typological constructions, particularly of stone artefacts where essential forms are often thought of as ‘mental templates’, or combinations of traits that are favoured by the maker. Variation in artifact form and attributes is seen as a consequence of the imperfect realization of the template, and is usually attributed to differences in raw material properties or individuals' technical competences.\n\nAlthough the principles were not clearly articulated, the application of basic typological techniques can occasionally be found in the work of early modern antiquaries. As early as the 1530s, John Leland successfully identified Roman bricks (under the misleading designation \"Briton brykes\") at several different sites, distinguishing them from more modern bricks by size and shape. Antiquaries began to recognise in the late 16th century that medieval monumental effigies represented with their legs crossed were likely to be older than those with straight legs. In the late 17th century, John Aubrey worked out crude evolutionary sequences based on typological distinctions for medieval architecture, handwriting, shield-shapes and costume. The outline of the development of medieval Gothic architecture was further refined in the 18th century, culminating in the clear sequence of styles published by Thomas Rickman in 1817.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries archaeological typologies continued to be constructed using a combination of empirical observation and intuition. According to Eggers, most archaeologists give Oscar Montelius the credit for the first serious application of the typological method, but in Eggers' view, his contemporary colleague from Stockholm, Hans Hildebrand made important contributions to the development of the methodology as well. Hildebrand published a fundamental paper on the development of fibulae in the 1870s using the typological method, whereas Montelius at the same time went to international congresses and published smaller papers on this method.\n\nAnother early example is the typology published in 1899 by Flinders Petrie for the objects (mainly pottery) found in 900 prehistoric Egyptian graves. This typology formed the basis for his manual seriation of the graves.\n\nWith the development of statistical techniques and numerical taxonomy in the 1960s, mathematical methods (including Cluster analysis, Principal components analysis, correspondence analysis and Factor analysis) have been used to build typologies. These techniques provide a qualitative way to articulate the degrees of consistency among particular attributes. Correlation coefficients created by these methods help archaeologists discern between meaningful and useless similarities between artefacts. During the 1990s archaeologists began to use phylogenetic methods borrowed from Cladistics.\n\nFor cultures that produced pottery, archaeologists invariably spend a great deal of time defining ceramic \"types.\" Each type is a series of attributes which distinguishes one group of pottery (whether whole vessels or potsherds) from all other groups of pottery, such that each type was produced in a single time and place. Ideally, the attributes used to identify types are ones that are identifiable with the naked eye, and are found on small fragments of pottery, so that the sorting of potsherds into types is quick and straightforward. By sorting potsherds in terms of types, archaeologists can examine a series of potsherds (including those lying on a site surface) and quickly suggest when and where the pottery was made. By extension, they can estimate when a prehistoric site was used, whether there are any traded pieces, and so on.\n\nThe names assigned to the ceramic types are arbitrary. In United States, the common practice is a two-part name, the first part being an arbitrary geographic reference and the second part providing a brief description of the pottery's most obvious design attributes. Thus, for example, the type \"Flagstaff Black-on-white\" was first defined using a collection from the vicinity of Flagstaff, Arizona, and its primary design attribute is the use of black paint on a white background.\n\nNon-archaeologists should be aware of the limitations of ceramic typology. All such typologies are abstractions, and fail to describe all of the variability in an artistic tradition. Professional disagreement over specifics is common. Changes in ceramic design did not happen overnight, and archaeological typologies tend to break continua of design evolution into arbitrary (but highly useful) units. Most archaeological dates are approximate.\n\nIn the middle of the twentieth century, German photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher raised typology to an art form by photographing countless similar architectural features including water towers, workers' houses and industrial landscapes. They documented their work in books.\n\n\"There are four main types of typologies that archaeologists organize artifacts into.\"\n\nOne class of typology consists of a descriptive or a morphological approach. It is based on the physical characteristics and the external features of an artifact. Some examples of morphological and descriptive typologies would be categorizing artifacts distinctively on their weight, height, color, material, or whichever class the individual decides upon.\n\nAn example of morphological/descriptive typology consists of when an archaeologist excavates a site and finds dozens upon dozens of Native American arrowheads. The archaeologist narrows down their classification by organizing the pieces into morphological/descriptive groups. So, the projectile points could be sorted by weight, height, color, material, or however the archaeologists prefers. One of the first national typology bases available on the web, The Projectile Points Typology Database , exhibits how the arrowhead artifacts found are classified among the fifty states by region, state, or nationwide.\n\nIn this particular example, the arrowheads are classified by their shape. The categories consist of: notched, stemmed, lanceolate, and other projectile points. Each category may also be narrowed down into subsequent ones.\nThis type consists of sequential ordering of archaeological artifacts merely based on form. It involves collecting dates or relative dates that establishes the position in time the artifact lies in to reflect the civilization/events of a current region A chronological typology is made up of diagnostic artifacts, or relics that suggests a particular event/people occurred during a period of time See underglaze painted earthenwares for an example of chronological typology.\n\nArtifacts organized into this kind of typology are sorted by the use they serve rather than the looks they have or the chronological sequence they possess. In some cases, the artifacts may not be removed because of the functional purpose they exhibit, and the restoration of the pieces can be more difficult than other types of objects \n\nThis type of classification displays information about the artifact via the object's display. Stylistic typology is not to be confused with classification of certain styles, for that would just entail organizing artifacts based on how they look. This type of typology accounts for information told through the artifact. Pottery is an example of a stylistic typology because the artifacts provide information on artistic evolution.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3103340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3103340", "title": "Unitary executive theory", "text": "Unitary executive theory\n\nThe unitary executive theory is a theory of American constitutional law holding that the President possesses the power to control the entire executive branch. The doctrine is rooted in Article Two of the United States Constitution, which vests \"the executive power\" of the United States in the President.\n\nAlthough that general principle is widely accepted, there is disagreement about the strength and scope of the doctrine. It can be said that some favor a \"strongly unitary\" executive, while others favor a \"weakly unitary\" executive. The former group argue, for example, that Congress's power to interfere with intra-executive decision-making (such as firing executive branch officials) is limited, and that the President can control policy-making by all executive agencies within the limits set for those agencies by Congress. Still others agree that the Constitution requires a unitary executive, but believe this to be harmful, and propose its abolition by constitutional amendment.\n\nPlural executives exist in several states where, in contrast to the federal government, executive officers such as lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller, secretary of state, and others, are elected independently of the state's governor, with Texas being one example. This type of executive structure is known as a plural executive. Another type of plural executive, used in Japan, Israel, and Sweden, though not in any U.S. state, in which a collegial body comprises the executive branch – however, that collegial body does not comprise multiple members elected in elections, but is rather more akin to the U.S. Cabinet in formation and structure.\n\nThe Vesting Clause of Article II provides, \"The executive Power [of the United States] shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\" Proponents of the unitary executive theory argue that this language, along with the Take Care Clause (\"The President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed...\"), creates a \"hierarchical, unified executive department under the direct control of the President.\"\n\nThe general principle that the President controls the entire executive branch was originally rather innocuous, but extreme forms of the theory have developed. John Dean explains: \"In its most extreme form, unitary executive theory can mean that neither Congress nor the federal courts can tell the President what to do or how to do it, particularly regarding national security matters.\"\n\nAccording to law professors Lawrence Lessig and Cass Sunstein, \"No one denies that in some sense the framers created a unitary executive; the question is in what sense. Let us distinguish between a strong and a weak version.\" In either its strong or weak form, the theory would limit the power of Congress to divest the President of control of the executive branch. The \"strongly unitary\" theory posits stricter limits on Congress than the \"weakly unitary\" theory.\n\nSome scholars oppose even the \"weakly unitary\" theory and favor creating a plural executive, as in the many state governments that separately elect an attorney general. However, those scholars acknowledge that a constitutional amendment would be required to eliminate the federal unitary executive.\n\nProponents of a strongly unitary theory argue that the president possesses \"all\" of the executive power and can therefore control subordinate officers and agencies of the executive branch. This implies that the power of Congress to remove executive agencies or officers from Presidential control is limited. Thus, under the strongly unitary executive theory, independent agencies and counsels are unconstitutional to the extent that they exercise discretionary executive power not controlled by the president.\n\nThe judicial branch implications are that a part of the executive branch cannot sue another part because \"the executive cannot sue himself.\" If the federal courts were to adjudicate disputes between executive agencies, it would violate the doctrine of separation of powers.\n\nThe phrase \"unitary executive\" was discussed as early as the Philadelphia Convention in 1787, referring mainly to having a single individual fill the office of President, as proposed in the Virginia Plan. The alternative was to have several executives or an executive council, as proposed in the New Jersey Plan and as promoted by Elbridge Gerry, Edmund Randolph, and George Mason.\n\nAt the Pennsylvania ratifying convention in 1787, James Wilson emphasized the advantages of a single chief executive, including greater accountability, vigor, decisiveness, and responsibility:\n\n[T]he executive authority is one. By this means we obtain very important advantages. We may discover from history, from reason, and from experience, the security which this furnishes. The executive power is better to be trusted when it has no screen. Sir, we have a responsibility in the person of our President; he cannot act improperly, and hide either his negligence or inattention; he cannot roll upon any other person the weight of his criminality; no appointment can take place without his nomination; and he is responsible for every nomination he makes. We secure vigor. We well know what numerous executives are. We know there is neither vigor, decision, nor responsibility, in them. Add to all this, that officer is placed high, and is possessed of power far from being contemptible; yet not a single privilege is annexed to his character; far from being above the laws, he is amenable to them in his private character as a citizen, and in his public character by impeachment.\n\nIn 1788, the letters of the Federal Farmer were published, generally considered among the most astute of Anti-Federalist writings. The pseudonymous Federal Farmer defended the proposed unitary executive, arguing that \"a single man seems to be peculiarly well circumstanced to superintend the execution of laws with discernment and decision, with promptitude and uniformity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Federalists such as James Madison were emphasizing an additional advantage of a unitary executive. In Federalist No. 51, he wrote that an undivided executive would strengthen the ability of the executive to resist encroachments by the legislature: “As the weight of the legislative authority requires that it should be thus divided [into branches], the weakness of the executive may require, on the other hand, that it should be fortified.”\n\nAlexander Hamilton later pointed out that the Constitution grants executive power and legislative power in different ways, with the legislative powers of Congress being expressly limited to what is \"herein granted,\" unlike executive powers which are not expressly limited by an enumeration. Hamilton wrote:\n\nIn the article which gives the legislative powers of the government, the expressions are \"All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the United States.\" In that which grants the executive power, the expressions are \"The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.\" The enumeration ought therefore to be considered, as intended merely to specify the principal articles implied in the definition of executive power...\n\nIn other words, the principle of \"expressio unius\" may be more applicable as a limitation upon congressional power than upon executive power. According to Hamilton, the unenumerated executive powers that are vested solely in the President \"flow from the general grant of that power, interpreted in conformity with other parts of the Constitution, and with the principles of free government.\"\n\nThose other parts of the Constitution include the extensive powers granted to Congress. Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the exclusive power to make laws, which the President then must execute, provided that those laws are constitutional. Article I, Section 8, clause 18 of the Constitution known as the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power to \"make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution all Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof\". The Constitution also grants Congress power \"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.\" The theory of the unitary executive can only be legitimate insofar as it allows Congress to wield its constitutional powers while ensuring that the President can do the same.\n\nIn the 1926 case of \"Myers v. United States\", the United States Supreme Court decided that the President has the exclusive power to remove executive branch officials, and does not need the approval of the Senate or any other legislative body. The Court also wrote:\n\nThe ordinary duties of officers prescribed by statute come under the general administrative control of the President by virtue of the general grant to him of the executive power, and he may properly supervise and guide their construction of the statutes under which they act in order to secure that unitary and uniform execution of the laws which article 2 of the Constitution evidently contemplated in vesting general executive power in the President alone.\n\nSubsequent cases such as \"Humphrey's Executor v. United States\" (Presidential removal of certain kinds of officers), \"United States v. Nixon\" (executive privilege), and \"Bowsher v. Synar\" (control of executive functions) have flexed the doctrine's reach back and forth. Justice Scalia in his solitary dissent in \"Morrison v. Olson\" argued for an unlimited presidential removal power of all persons exercising executive branch powers, which he argued included the independent counsel; the court disagreed, but later moved closer to Scalia's position in \"Edmond v. United States\".\n\nLoyola Law School Professors Karl Manheim and Allan Ides write that \"the separation among the branches is not and never was intended to be airtight,\" and they point to the President's veto power as an example of the executive exercising legislative power. They also cite other examples of quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial power being exercised by the executive branch, as necessary elements of the administrative state, but they contend that ultimately all administrative power belongs to Congress rather than the President, and the only true \"executive\" powers are those explicitly described in the Constitution. In this understanding, Manheim and Ides follow in the footsteps of Lessig and Sunstein.\n\nProfessors David Jeremiah Barron and Marty Lederman have also criticized the strong version of the unitary executive theory. They acknowledge that there is a compelling case for a unitary executive within the armed forces. However, they argue that the Constitution does not provide for an equally strong unitary executive outside the military context, and they argue that the would be superfluous if the same kind of unitary presidential authority resulted from the general constitutional provision vesting executive power in the President.\n\nContrary to claims of some authors, the first administration to make explicit reference to the \"Unitary Executive\" was not that of President George W. Bush. For example, in 1987, Ronald Reagan issued a signing statement that declared: \"If this provision were interpreted otherwise, so as to require the President to follow the orders of a subordinate, it would plainly constitute an unconstitutional infringement of the President's authority as head of a unitary executive branch.\"\n\nThe George W. Bush administration made the Unitary Executive Theory a common feature of signing statements. For example, Bush once wrote in a signing statement that he would, \"construe Title X in Division A of the Act, relating to detainees, in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power.\" Critics acknowledge that part of the President's duty is to \"interpret what is, and is not constitutional, at least when overseeing the actions of executive agencies,\" but critics accused Bush of overstepping that duty by his perceived willingness to overrule U.S. courts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35189349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35189349", "title": "Vedette (cabaret)", "text": "Vedette (cabaret)\n\nA vedette is the main female artist of a show derived from cabaret and its genres (revue, vaudeville, music hall or burlesque). \n\nThe purpose of the vedette in a cabaret or nightclub show is to entertain the public. The vedette has to know how to sing, dance and act on stage. Depending on the quality of its show, career or mastery of one or more stage talents, can be considered a \"super vedette\" or \"first vedette\". Generally a vedette is a woman with physical presence, personality and charisma that captivates the public. In addition to singing, dancing and acting, vedettes often included groups of dancers, flashy and revealing costumes, magicians, comedians, jugglers, and even performing animals. Vedettes specializing in burlesque generally do striptease and may also perform nude on stage.\n\nIn the 20th century, vedette shows were successful in the cabarets, theaters and nightclubs of countries such as Spain, France, Argentina and Mexico. Paris and Las Vegas were considered the main cradle of the vedettes.\n\n\"Vedette\" is a French word originally used to designate an artist of great fame and notoriety.\n\nThe term underwent changes over the years. From the early twentieth century, it began to be used to designate the main female artists of the shows of a cabaret such as burlesque, vaudeville, music hall or revue. The zenith of fame and popularity of these women coincided with various historical moments of 20th century sexual liberation: the 1920s, 1940s and 1970s.\n\nThe vedettes began their rise in popularity in France at the beginning of the 20th century. After France, they have gained greater popularity in Latin countries, both in Europe (Spain) and North and South America (Argentina and Mexico), where they caused a furor in the nightlife at different times. The term is little used in Anglo-Saxon countries, although in the United States there are very popular shows of cabaret and burlesque in the city of Las Vegas, where it is often confused with so-called showgirls. Venues such as Le Lido, the Moulin Rouge, and the Crazy Horse in France. The Teatro Maipo and the Teatro El Nacional in Argentina, and the Teatro de la Ciudad \"Esperanza Iris\" in Mexico are or were famous for their vedette shows.\n\nFrance is considered the cradle of vedettes worldwide. Its capital, Paris, has been home to some of the most famous cabarets in the world. Among these are the Moulin Rouge and the Folies Bergère de Paris, pioneers of night shows in which the vedettes appeared on the scene half naked and doing Tableau vivant. Other famous venues are the Le Lido and Bataclan, also famous for their vaudeville and Revues. In more recent times, this group of entertainment centers would be joined by Crazy Horse.\n\nAmong the main vedettes of France are considered the \"Three Graces\" of Belle Époque: Émilienne d'Alençon, Liane de Pougy, and La Bella Otero. The famous Mistinguett became one of the most popular French artists of her time and the most important woman in the world of the spectacle, while Madame Rasimi is remembered as the founder of the Bataclan. Another outstanding figure was Gina Palerme.\n\nAt the beginning of the century, the novelist Colette was also distinguished by acting in shows of magazine. Another prominent figure at that time is the world-famous Dutch spy Mata Hari.\n\nThe legendary Cléo de Mérode of the Folies Bergère was another of the great stars of the Parisian nightlife of the twentieth century.\nJoséphine Baker, of American origin, is remembered as one of the most important vedettes of the twentieth century. Her \"Revue Nègre\", which included a jazz orchestra, caused a sensation in the Parisian cabarets. Her exotic dance form, her uninhibited sexuality and her minimal dress (which included a skirt made with bananas) were more attractive to Europeans than to Americans. She became the star of Parisian nights and even opened her own club, Chez \"Josephine\".\n\nAnother important figure was Coccinelle, considered the first transsexual vedette in history.\nThe actress and singer Liliane Montevecchi stood out as vedette in the Folies Bergère in the 1970s, and eventually conquered Broadway. Another figure of the time was the Italian Xenia Monty.\n\nIn recent times the vedette shows emphasize figures like Arielle Dombasle (known as the vedette-like Dolorès Sugar Rose) and Marlène Mourreau.\n\nOne of the first vedettes that stood out in Spain are La Bella Otero, a celebrated courtesan who settled in France, one of the most outstanding personages of the Belle Époque in the artistic circles and the gallant life of Paris; Luisa Esteso, famous comedian actress; Encarnación Fernández, who had most of her career in Argentina; Celia Gámez (of Argentine origin), one of the most popular stars of Spain in the first half of the twentieth century, and who owes much of the splendor of the Revues; Paquita Garzón; Rosario Guerrero (called \"The Beautiful Guerrero\"); Rosita Rodrigo; Tina de Jarque, Rosario Soler \"La Patita\", Paquita Escribano, Carmen Tórtola Valencia, specialist in oriental dances and pioneer of women's liberation, and the sisters Laura and Victoria Pinillos.\n\nThe 1940s highlighted figures such as Trini Alonso, María Antinea (also famous in Argentina and Mexico); Maruja Boldoba, Florinda Chico, Gema del Rio, the popular Manolita Chen and her company; Teresita Silva; Maruja Tomás and Helga Liné.\n\nThe 1950s highlighted stars like Mary Begoña, one of the comedic actresses par excellence of the Spanish scene; Licia Calderón, Queta Claver (that became one of the major vedettes of Spain); Raquel Daina; Marujita Díaz, considered as the \"Queen of the Copla\" and \"Queen of the Spanish Music Revue\" and Carmen de Lirio, famous during the dictatorship.\n\nIn the sixties, famous figures such as Mary Santpere, called \"La Reina del Paralelo\" (The Queen of the Parallel) reached the fame of Barcelona's homonymous street, where the greatest number of theaters were concentrated in the 20th century; Rosita Amores, pioneer of the erotic cabaret in the mid-1960s, and who knew how to outwit Franco's censorship in times when eroticism in Spain was confined to the private sphere, becoming a popular symbol of entertainment in the Valencian Community; Marisol Ayuso; Ingrid Garbo, of German origin; Vicky Lagos; Vicky Lusson; Katia Loritz; Esperanza Roy, and Lina Morgan, one of the country's most momentous comic strips. Sara Montiel, deserves special mention, who along with her prestigious film career, excelled in shows as a vedette from this decade.\n\nIn the 1970s María José Cantudo starred in the first full-length female nude (seen through a mirror) of Spanish cinema; Eva León Conde and Barbara Rey were also popular vedettes of the period.\n\nFrom the 1980s and 1990s stand out figures such as Lita Claver \"La Maña\"; Norma Duval, one of the last stars of the traditional magazine, a type of spectacle that during those years was in decline and that was maintained mainly thanks to the tourists who visited Paris; Tania Doris, another one of the last representatives of the sort in Spain ; Paloma Hurtado, María José Nieto \"Maripepa\", Rosa Valenty, Africa Pratt and the French Marlène Mourreau.\n\nIn the last years they have emphasized figures like La Terremoto de Alcorcón and the transsexual actresses ´Bibiana Fernandez, La Veneno and La Prohibida.\n\nRevue shows were popularized in Buenos Aires from the 1920s, mainly in the Teatro Maipo. Tita Merello became one of the most famous vedettes of the time.\n\nIn the 1950s vedettes of Cuban origin appeared, like Blanquita Amaro Amelia Vargas and Rosita Fornés. They had all the glitz, grace and glamor that characterized the era, and shared the stage with local stars like Nélida Roca.\n\nIn the 1960s appeared figures like Zulma Faiad, Nélida Lobato, Susana Brunetti, Norma Pons, Egle Martín and the Puerto Rican Iris Chacón, called the \"Vedette of America\".\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s gave way to other stars like Graciela Alfano and the sisters Ethel and Gogó Rojo. \nOthers who arose at that time and remained in force in the following years were Susana Giménez Moria Casán and Bettina Vardé.\n\nIn the 1990s, new vedettes appeared, some of whose fame would spread to the next decade, such as Cris Miró, María Fernanda Callejón, the Puerto Rican Lourdes Chacón and Monica Ayos.\n\nIn the first years of the 21st century there is a return of the revues in the Avenida Corrientes with figures like Florencia de la V, María Eugenia Ritó, Adabel Guerrero, and Valeria Archimó.\n\nThe image of the Vedette in Mexico arises from the beginning of the 20th century with the rise of the called \"Carpas\" and the Revues. Some venues such as Teatro Principal, the Teatro Colón and the Teatro Arbeu were considered as the cathedral of the revues and burlesque in Mexico City. There arise figures like Lupe Vélez, who, before being consecrated as a star in Hollywood, was considered one of the queens of the frivolous theater. The maximum figure of the time was Maria Conesa \"The White Kitten\", who also had a very long career spanning theater, film and television. Other outstanding figures of the time were Esperanza Iris, Celia Montalván, Lupe Rivas Cacho, Amparo Arozamena, Prudencia Grifell, Celia Padilla, Delia Magaña, Lupe Inclán, Aurora Walker, Amelia Wilhelmy and Mimí Derba, among others. Conesa, Montalván and Rivas Cacho, were even immortalized in a famous foxtrot called \"Mi querido capitán (My dear captain)\".\nIn the 1950s saw a resurgence of nightlife in Mexico City. Venues like the Tivoli, the Waikikí, the Margo (after the Teatro Blanquita), the Follies Bergere and the Teatro Lírico, among others, became the main forums for the blossoming of the vedettes. Special mention should be made of the \"Exoticas\", a group of vedettes that caused fury in Mexico's nightlife in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These \"Exoticas\" were characterized by using extravagant names, and their shows included African, Tahitian or Oriental dances. The most famous of the \"Exoticas\" was Yolanda Montes \"Tongolele\", one of the most important dancers of Latin America, and has been in force for more than sixty years. Together with \"Tongolele\", the most famous were Su Muy Key \"The Chinese Doll\", and Kalantan. Another famous \"Exóticas\" were Trudi Bora, Turanda, Joyce Cameron, Tanabonga, Tundra, Gemma, Eda Lorna, Kurumba, Bongala, Tula Montenegro, Brenda Conde, Josefina del Mar and Naná.\nParallel to the success of the Exoticas, they appear in Mexico the famous \"Rumberas\", dancers of Afro-American rhythms. The Rumberas managed to create their own cinematographic genre: The Rumberas film In the called Golden Age of Mexican cinema. The Rumberas films reflected in many of its arguments the life of the women in the night centers and cabarets. The main exponents of the genre were the Cubans María Antonieta Pons, Amalia Aguilar, Ninón Sevilla and Rosa Carmina as well the Mexican Meche Barba. \nThese women were complete vedettes who never needed to explicitly teach their bodies, captivating audiences only with their dances and other stage talents. The Rumberas also performed shows and live performances in important venues. With the decline of the Rumberas film in the mid-fifties, some rumberas broadened their horizons and ventured into vedette shows. Particularly remembered are the live shows of Amalia Aguilar and Rosa Carmina, who even filled stadiums in various countries in Central and South America.\nThe Cuban Rosita Fornés deserves special mention. She reaches the final consecration in Mexico before conquering the rest of the continent.\n\nIn the 1960s the splendor of the vedettes in Mexico lost force. Even so, worthy of mention are the shows offered in venues such as the Blanquita Theater or \"El Patio\" by the stars such as Sonia Furió, Ana Luisa Peluffo and Ana Bertha Lepe. In the midst of the fury of the Rock and Roll era, were famous figures like Malú Reyes and Emily Cranz. Actresses such as Jacqueline Voltaire and Irán Eory also performed shows as vedettes.\nThe 1970s and 1980s are considered the golden era of the vedettes in Mexico, thanks to a massive revival of nightlife in the country's capital. Mexico City was flooded with nightclubs, cabarets of all levels and burlesque theaters where the vedettes began to bloom. Among the most important nightclubs that illuminated the capital of the country are the Terazza Casino, the Capri (from the Hotel Regis), the Imperial, the Minuet, the Rio Rosa, La Fuente, El Conjunto Marrakech, La Copa de Champagne, El Cordiale, El Rondinella, El Clóset, El Quid, El 77, the Impala Bar and the Belvedere of the Hilton Continental Hotel. Some cabarets such as La Burbuja, Montparnasse, Las Fabulosas, El Can-Can, Los Globos, King Kong and Savoy also reached a great boom, while theaters like El Iris, El Blanquita and the Teatro Fru Fru presented burlesque shows, where the shows were more audacious and explicit. In addition, thanks to television, movies and magazines, the vedettes in Mexico reached their highest point of popularity. Many of them also ventured into the cinema, within the so-called Mexican sex comedy. \nOn the other hand, the popular television program \"Variedades de medianoche (Varieties of the Midnight)\" contributed to the boom of these women and launched to the fame to dozens of them.\n\nAmong the legendary vedettes that illuminated the nightlife of Mexico City are Olga Breeskin also known as \"Super Olga\" who achieved great fame for her spectacular performances where she danced surrounded by dancers and exotic animals while playing the violin; Angélica Chaín, who achieved fame first in magazines, then start a career as a vedette and finally consecrate herself in the cinema; Amira Cruzat, famous for her show known as \"The Dressing Room of Amira Cruzat\"; Lila Deneken \"The Number One\", important singer and the first Latin American star to present a show at the Monte-Carlo Sporting Club; the Argentine Zulma Faiad who settled in Mexico much of the decade of the 1970s and reached a great fame in cinema and night centers; Gloriella, popular star of the burlesque and numerous movies; Princesa Lea, very popular for presenting a show in which she bathed in a glass of champagne; Lyn May, of Chinese ancestry, pioneer of the nudes and one of the principal stars of the burlesque; Rossy Mendoza, known popularly as \"The Body\" or \"The Shorter Waist\", thanks to her impressive anatomy; Sasha Montenegro, who on par of her film career performed live shows that attracted the public because of her popularity; The Brazilian Gina Montes, famous by her appearance in a popular TV Show; Grace Renat, \"The Goddess of the Night\", Irma Serrano, who scandalized at the time with her controversial theatrical spectacles in the enclosure of her property, the Theater Fru-Frú; Wanda Seux, called \"The Golden Bomb\" and considered the \"Barbie\" of the vedettes for her thin figure and blonde hair; Thelma Tixou \"The Girl of the Golden Body\", native of Argentina, famous for her stature and imposing physique, and star for several years of the famous cabaret El Capri, Isela Vega, popular Mexican film actress, who scandalized audiences with her provocative shows in the stage, and Princesa Yamal, famous by her Arabian exotic dances.\n\nOther outstanding figures were Brigitte Aubé, Cleopatra, Alejandra del Moral, Mora Escudero, Gioconda, Ivonne Govea, Iris Cristal, Yolanda Liévana, Norma Lee, Mara Marú, Miss Melina Mey, Gina Morett, the transgender Jessica Muriel, Valeria Pani, Noelia Noel, Gabriela Ríos, Olga Ríos, Lina Santos, Merle Uribe and Judith Velasco Herrera, among many others.\n\nIn the year 2016, the filmmaker María José Cuevas made the documentary \"Beauties of the Night\", which portrays the life of five of these great vedettes.\n\nOne of the last great vedettes in Mexico was Francis García, a transvestite artist who was the main star of the Teatro Blanquita for more than a decade.\nIn recent years, large night centers have virtually disappeared from Mexico. Some actresses and singers perform shows of vedettes in other venues, such as the \"Palenques\". Among them are figures such as Costa Rican Maribel Guardia, Mexicans Lorena Herrera, Mariana Seoane, the transgender Alejandra Bogue and Ninel Conde and the Cubans Niurka Marcos and Lis Vega.\n\nThe term \"vedette\" is not commonly used in the United States or other Anglo-Saxon countries, (here called \"showgirls\"). Las Vegas is considered, after Paris, as the main venue for revue shows and musicals worldwide.\n\nThe British Lydia Thompson became a leading dancer and actress in burlesques on the London stage. She introduced Victorian burlesque to America with her troupe the \"British Blondes\", in 1868, to great acclaim and notoriety.\n\nOf the most famous American vedettes, stand out May Yohé, one of the most valued figures of the vaudeville at the beginning of the century; The aforementioned Josephine Baker, who ended up consecrating herself in France, where she was more popular than in her own country; Fanny Brice, star of the famous Ziegfeld Follies, queen of the theater, revues and later also star of cinema and the radio; Sally Rand, actress and dancer, specializing in fan dancing, which she popularized at the Paramount Club, and who because of the postures considered indecent she adopted with the dance was sometimes arrested. Also conceived the famous dance of the bubble; Zorita, famous for her shows where she played double roles and for her dances where she used boas and other exotic animals; Evelyn West, also known as \"The Hubba Hubba Girl\", a burlesque legend of the forties, fifties and sixties; Ann Corio, who also works in several Hollywood films; Mae West, who achieved tremendous fame, first in theater and then in Hollywood, where she scandalized censorship for her provocative behavior and spicy phrases. In the 1950s and 1960s, she achieved fame in her shows, which included groups of dancers and bodybuilders; Gypsy Rose Lee, immortalized in the famous autobiographical musical \"Gypsy\". Her innovations consisted of a casual style, against the spasmodic movements of other strippers (she emphasized the joke during the striptease) and brought a keen sense of humor to her performances. She was one of the main stars of the Minsky's Burlesque, with whom she worked four years. Working with the Minsky brothers was arrested several times. Another important figure of this time was Novita \"The Pixie of Burlesque\", one of the founders of the Exotic Dancers League (EDL).\nIn the 1960s and 1970s some burlesque figures peaked in the United States, particularly at the shows offered in Las Vegas. Of these are highlighted Tempest Storm, Lili St. Cyr, Blaze Starr, Tura Satana, Bambi Jones and Satan's Angel.\n\nThe most important in recent years has been Liza Minnelli\n\nToday, among the most famous vedettes in the United States are Dita Von Teese, who was the star of Crazy Horse, Julie Atlas Muz, Michelle L'amour, Catherine D'lish, Miss Dirty Martini, the British Immodesty Blaze, Angie Pontani, ,Jo Weldon and the Singaporean Sukki Singapora, the first international burlesque artist in Singapore. Singapora became the first burlesque artist in the world to be invited to tea at Buckingham Palace as a recognition of her contribution to the arts as an Asian model.\n\nOther prominent vedettes who have appeared in the world are the Puerto Rican Iris Chacón, the Brazilian Luz del Fuego, the Cubans Chelo Alonso and Rita Montaner, the Peruvian Amparo Brambilla and the Venezuelan Diosa Canales.\n\n\n\n"}

The direct object gets \"promoted\" to subject, and the subject \"demoted\" to an (optional) adjunct. In the first example above, \"the mouse\" serves as the direct object in the active-voice version, but becomes the subject in the passive version. The subject of the active-voice version, \"the cat\", becomes part of a prepositional phrase in the passive version of the sentence, and can be left out entirely.\n\nIn the grammar of Ancient Greek, voice was called διάθεσις (\"diáthesis\") \"arrangement\" or \"condition\", with three subcategories: active (ἐνέργεια [enérgeia]), passive (πάθος [páthos]), and middle (μεσότης [mesótēs]).\nIn Latin there are two voices: active and passive (Latin: [genus] activum, passivum).\n\nThe active voice is the most commonly used in many languages and represents the \"normal\" case, in which the subject of the verb is the agent.\n\nIn the active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action or causes the happening denoted by the verb.\n\nExample: \"Kabaisa ate the potatoes.\"\n\nThe verb \"ate\" indicates the active voice. But consider the following sentence which is in passive voice:\n\n\"The potatoes were eaten by Kabaisa\".\n\nThe words \"were eaten\" indicate the passive voice.\n\nThe passive voice shows that something has been acted upon by someone or something else.\n\nThe passive voice is employed in a clause whose subject expresses the theme or patient of the verb. That is, it undergoes an action or has its state changed.\n\nIn the passive voice the grammatical subject of the verb is the recipient (not the doer) of the action denoted by the verb.\n\nSome languages, such as English and Spanish, use a \"periphrastic\" passive voice; that is, it is not a single word form, but rather a construction making use of other word forms. Specifically, it is made up of a form of the auxiliary verb \"to be\" and a past participle of the main verb. In other languages, such as Latin, the passive voice is simply marked on the verb by inflection: \"librum legit\" \"He reads the book\"; \"liber legitur\" \"The book is read\".\n\nSome languages (such as Albanian, Bengali, Fula, Tamil, Sanskrit, Icelandic, Swedish, Biblical Hebrew and Ancient Greek) have a middle voice, which is a set of inflections or constructions which is to some extent different from both the active and passive voices. The middle voice is said to be in the middle between the active and the passive voices because the subject often cannot be categorized as either agent or patient but may have elements of both. For example, it may express what would be an intransitive verb in English. In \"The casserole cooked in the oven\", \"cooked\" is syntactically active but semantically passive. In Classical Greek, the middle voice often has a reflexive sense: the subject acts on or for itself, such as \"The boy washes himself\", or \"The boy washes\". It can be transitive or intransitive. It can occasionally be used in a causative sense, such as \"The father causes his son to be set free\", or \"The father ransoms his son\".\n\nIn English there is no verb form for the middle voice, though some uses may be classified by traditional grammarians as middle voice, often resolved via a reflexive pronoun, as in \"Fred shaved\", which may be expanded to \"Fred shaved himself\" – contrast with active \"Fred shaved John\" or passive \"John was shaved by Fred\". This need not be reflexive, as in \"my clothes soaked in detergent overnight\". English used to have a distinct form, called the passival, which was displaced over the early 19th century by the progressive passive and is no longer used in English. In the passival, one might say \"The house is building.\", which may today be rendered instead as \"The house is being built.\" Likewise \"The meal is eating.\", which is now \"The meal is being eaten.\" Note that the similar \"Fred is shaving\" and \"the clothes are soaking\" remain grammatical. It is suggested that the progressive passive was popularized by the Romantic poets, and is connected with Bristol usage.\n\nMany deponent verbs in Latin (i.e., verbs passive in form but active in meaning) are survivals of the Proto-Indo-European middle voice.\n\nSome languages have even more grammatical voices. For example, Classical Mongolian features five voices: active, passive, causative, reciprocal, and cooperative. Hebrew has active, passive, causative, intensive and reflexive voices.\n\nThe antipassive voice deletes or demotes the object of transitive verbs, and promotes the actor to an intransitive subject. This voice is very common among ergative–absolutive languages (which may feature passive voices as well), but also occurs among nominative–accusative languages.\n\nThere are also constructions in some languages that appear to change the valence of a verb, but in fact do not. So called hierarchical or inversion languages are of this sort. Their agreement system will be sensitive to an external person or animacy hierarchy (or a combination of both): 1 > 2 > 3 or Anim > Inan and so forth. E.g., in Meskwaki (an Algonquian language), verbs inflect for both subject and object, but agreement markers do not have inherent values for these. Rather, a third marker, the direct or inverse marker, indicates the proper interpretation: \"ne-wa:pam-e:-w-a\" [1-look.at-DIR-3-3Sg] \"I am looking at him\", but \"ne-wa:pam-ekw-w-a\" [1-look.at-INV-3-3Sg] \"He is looking at me\". Some scholars (notably Rhodes) have analyzed this as a kind of obligatory passivization dependent on animacy, while others have claimed it is not a voice at all, but rather see inversion as another type of alignment, parallel to nominative–accusative, ergative–absolutive, split-S, and fluid-S alignments.\n\nTopic-prominent languages like Mandarin tend not to employ the passive voice as frequently. Mandarin-speakers construct the passive voice by using the coverb (\"bèi\") and rearranging the usual word order. For example, this sentence using active voice:\n\nNote: the first line is in Traditional Chinese while the second is Simplified Chinese.\n\ncorresponds to the following sentence using passive voice. Note that the agent phrase is optional.\n\nIn addition, through the addition of the auxiliary verb \"to be\" (\"shì\") the passive voice is frequently used to emphasize the identity of the actor. This example places emphasis on the \"dog\", presumably as opposed to some other animal:\nMandarin has also a \"object-retaining passive\" which contains both object and topic (mostly the possessor of the object) :\n\nIn Cantonese, those features are quite similar by using the coverb (\"bei2\"), but the agent phrase is NOT optional, often with a formal agent 人(\"jan4\"):\n\nHowever, in some dialects of Yue, a passive voice with an optional agent phrase is also available:\n\nQinzhou (Qin-Lian Yue ):\n\nIn the actor-emphasizing passive voice of Cantonese, besides the addition of the auxiliary verb \"to be\" (\"hai6\") , the perfective event is also converted to a adjective-like predicative with the suffix (\"ge3\") or㗎(\"gaa3\"), which is a more emphasized one from the liaison of (\"ge3\") and 啊(\"aa3\"):\n\nAlthough a topic-prominent language, Japanese employs the passive voice quite frequently, and has two types of passive voice, one that corresponds to that in English and an indirect passive not found in English. This indirect passive is used when something undesirable happens to the speaker.\n\nSome languages do not contrast voices, but have other similar constructions. For example, Finnic languages such as Finnish and Estonian have a \"passive\", expressed by conjugating the verb in \"common person\". Although it is generally referred to as the passive (\"passiivi\") in Finnish grammars, it may more appropriately be referred to as the fourth person form of a verb.\n\nSimilarly in French and Welsh, impersonal forms are used: \"On lit le journal.\"; \"Darllenir y papur newydd.\": \"One reads the newspaper.\", i.e., \"The newspaper is read.\"\n\nThe function of the fourth person is simply to leave out the agent. The agent is almost always human and never mentioned. The grammatical role of the object remains unaltered, and thus transitivity may also be used. For example, the fourth-person construction \"Ikkuna hajotettiin\", with a transitive verb, means \"Someone broke the window\", while the third-person construction \"Ikkuna hajosi\" uses the anticausative and means \"The window broke\".\n\nCeltic languages have an inflection commonly called the \"impersonal\" or \"autonomous\" form, of similar origin to the Latin \"passive-impersonal\". This is similar to a passive construction in that the agent of the verb is not specified. However its syntax is different from prototypical passives, in that the object of the action remains in the accusative.\n\nIt is similar to the use of the pronoun \"on\" in French (except wherever \"on\" is instead used an alternative to \"we\", which is very frequent). It increasingly corresponds to the passive in modern English, in which there is a trend towards avoiding the use of the passive unless it is specifically required to omit the subject. It also appears to be similar to the \"fourth person\" mentioned in the preceding paragraph. However, what is called in Irish \"an briathar saor\" or \"the free verb\" does not suggest passivity but a kind of generalised agency.\n\nThe construction has equal validity in transitive and intransitive clauses, and the best translation into English is normally by using the \"dummy\" subjects \"they\", \"one\", or impersonal \"you\". For example, the common sign against tobacco consumption has its closest direct translation in English as \"No smoking\":\n\nAn example of its use as an intransitive is:\n\nThe difference between the autonomous and a true passive is that while the autonomous focuses on the action and overtly avoids mentioning the actor, there is nonetheless an anonymous agent who may be referred to in the sentence. For instance:\n\nIn English, the formation of the passive allows the optional inclusion of an agent in a prepositional phrase, \"by the man\", etc. Where English would leave out the noun phrase, Irish uses the autonomous; where English includes the noun phrase, Irish uses its periphrastic passive – which can also leave out the noun phrase:\n\nThe impersonal endings have been re-analysed as a passive voice in Modern Welsh and the agent can be included after the preposition \"gan\" (\"by\"):\n\nSome linguists draw a distinction between static (or stative) passive voice and dynamic (or eventive) passive voice in some languages. Examples include English, German, Swedish, Spanish and Italian. \"Static\" means that an action was done to the subject at a certain point in time resulting in a state in the time focussed upon, whereas \"dynamic\" means that an action takes place.\n\n\n\nNote that for some speakers of English this is not accepted and is considered colloquial or sub-standard.\n\nDynamic passive in Swedish is also frequently expressed with the s-ending.\n\nThe vara passive is often synonymous with, and sometimes preferable to, simply using the corresponding adjective:\n\nThe bli passive is often synonymous with, and sometimes preferable to, the s-passive:\n\nSpanish has two verbs corresponding to English \"to be\": \"ser\" and \"estar\". \"Ser\" is used to form the ordinary (dynamic) passive voice:\n\nHowever, this construction is very unidiomatic. The usual passive voice is the \"se pasiva\", in which the verb is conjugated in the active voice, but preceded by the \"se\" particle: \n\n\"Estar\" is used to form what might be termed a static passive voice (not regarded as a passive voice in traditional Spanish grammar):\n\nIn the \"ser\" and \"estar\" cases, the verb's participle is used as the complement (as is sometimes the case in English).\n\nItalian uses two verbs (\"essere\" and \"venire\") to translate the static and the dynamic passive:\n\nDynamic passive auxiliary verb: essere and venire (to be and to come)\n\nStatic passive auxiliary verb: essere (to be)\n\nIn Venetian (Vèneto) the difference between dynamic (true) passive and stative (adjectival) passive is more clear cut, using èser (to be) only for the static passives and vegner (to become, to come) only for the dynamic passive:\n\nStatic forms represents much more a property or general condition, whereas the dynamic form is a real passive action entailing \"by someone\":\n\nVoices found in various languages include:\n\n"}
