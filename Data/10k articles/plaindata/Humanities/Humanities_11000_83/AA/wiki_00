{"id": "4150614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4150614", "title": "A Modest Video Game Proposal", "text": "A Modest Video Game Proposal\n\nA Modest Video Game Proposal is the title of an open letter sent by activist/former attorney Jack Thompson to members of the press and to Entertainment Software Association president Doug Lowenstein on October 10, 2005. He proposed that, if someone could \"create, manufacture, distribute, and sell a video game in 2006\" that allows players to play the scenario he has written, in which the character kills video game developers, he will donate $10,000 to the charity of former Take-Two Interactive chairman Paul Eibeler's choosing. The title of the letter alludes to Jonathan Swift's 18th century satire essay \"A Modest Proposal\".\n\nThompson stated that he thought such a game would never be made because developers would be afraid to \"train\" people to kill them. He was unaware that Running With Scissors had already released a commercial first person shooter, \"Postal 2\", in which the player could massacre the employees of Running With Scissors, including its CEO, Vince Desi, and actor Gary Coleman. Before that, some games had the game company buildings as Easter eggs, sometimes destroyable by the player (for example, \"\" features the Activision headquarters in some levels), and \"Doom II\" even had the player essentially kill id Software co-founder John Romero in the final boss battle of the game.\n\nJack Thompson wrote a letter that describes a game whose protagonist is Osaki Kim, the father of a high school boy beaten to death with a baseball bat by a 14-year-old gamer who played a game about beating people to death with a bat. The game intro shows the court session where the killer is sentenced to \"only\" life in prison.\n\nOsaki Kim then swears vengeance, and gets weapons, \"even baseball bats. Especially baseball bats.\" Kim goes to New York to kill Paula Eibel, the CEO of \"Take This,\" the company that made the \"murder simulator on which his son's killer trained\", along with her husband and kids, then urinates on their severed brain stems (as in \"Postal²\"). (\"Take This\" is a parody of the name \"Take-Two Interactive,\" whose developers created the games Grand Theft Auto, Bully, and Manhunt, all of which are games which Jack Thompson lobbied against.) Kim then kills the lawyers of \"Blank, Stare\", the law firm that defended Take This, \"with singer Jackson Browne's 1980's hit Lawyers in Love blaring.\" Kim then destroys high-tech video arcades called \"GameWerks\". Lastly, he goes to E³ on its opening at May 10, 2006, destroying all video game industry execs in \"one final, monstrously delicious rampage\".\n\nAlong the way, Kim steals supplies from Best Buy, Circuit City, Target and Wal-Mart stores, and roughs up store managers and clerks, yelling \"'You should have checked kids' IDs!'\"\n\nA group of modders known as the Fighting Hellfish (the name is taken from an episode of \"The Simpsons\") had released exactly one week prior a mod for the game \"\", called \"Defamation of Character: A Jack Thompson Murder Simulator\". The mod features Jack Thompson himself acting out a remarkably similar scenario, at one point even assassinating Doug Lowenstein. Acting under hypnosis, Thompson moonlights as Banman and takes to the streets in his \"Bannedwagon\" to destroy the entire shipment of Rockstar's \"Bully\" before it reaches distribution. Jack later assassinates Janet Reno after thwarting her coup, which forces him to confront the realization that his time spent researching violent games has turned him into his own \"Manchurian Candidate\". Although the team never asked him to donate the money, Thompson refused to when he discovered that the game existed. Initially he claimed that the game did not meet his criteria but later claimed that his proposal was satire and said that he would not donate the $10,000.\n\nThompson argued that the game had to be released in 2006, that Paul Eibeler had yet to pick a charity, and that the game had to be released by a company, not thrown together by \"anyone in a garage\". Despite his former claim that his proposal was satire, he claimed the offer was still valid, and that only the description of the scenario was satire, the offer to donate money was real.\n\nIn response to the 'Modest Proposal', a team \"Consisting of 3 alcoholics and a foreign exchange student\" formed a company called Thompsonsoft and created \"I'm O.K – A Murder Simulator\" in January 2006.\n\nThe game is based on the description of the 'Modest Proposal', and features several weapons. The story follows a disgruntled father of a killing victim who takes his revenge upon the games industry, which he blames for 'training' the man who killed his son. The father begins a spree of murders in retaliation, attacking the offices of \"Take This,\" who made the game, and killing the chairman \"Paula Eibel\" and her family. The father then begins a road trip across the states, back to Los Angeles, then assaulting the law firm \"Blank, Stare\" who represent \"Take This\" and various gaming arcades and games stores before arriving at E3 and completing a \"monstrously delicious rampage\" on the participants. Thompson argued that the game industry would never make such a game, in which the targets are virtual representations of themselves, for fear of turning players into their own killers. Jack Thompson later claimed that the game didn't come close to his Proposal, although other than the fact that former Take-Two Interactive CEO Paul Eibeler hasn't officially picked a charity, he hasn't gone into detail as to what parts of his proposal are yet to be satisfied. He also announced that \"the attorneys for these idiots will be contacted.\"\n\nOn October 17, 2005, Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins of \"Penny Arcade\" donated the promised $10,000 to charity on Jack Thompson's behalf. Krahulik and Holkins donated the money, under Thompson's name, to the Entertainment Software Association Foundation, the charitable arm of the Entertainment Software Association. Thompson e-mailed both \"Penny Arcade\" and Joystiq, who ran a story about the donation, demanding that the articles be taken down \"or else.\" The check was presented to the ESA Foundation at an ESAF fundraising dinner in San Francisco; in its memo line was written: \"For Jack Thompson Because Jack Thompson Won't\".\n\nIn retaliation, Jack Thompson faxed a letter to Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske, requesting assistance in halting the activities of Krahulik and Holkins. In his letter, he described how personnel within \"Penny Arcade\" were harassing him: the sale of an \"I Hate Jack Thompson\" shirt and frequent postings on their website where they allegedly admitted to harassment.\n\nAccording to GameSpot, as of 9:55AM PDT October 18, 2005, the Seattle Police Department had not received Thompson's fax, which at that point had been sent to GameSpot, \"Penny Arcade\", and other sites. Thompson emailed GameSpot, claiming that he had fixed the URL for \"Penny Arcade\" (which was incorrect in the original fax) and faxed the letter, commenting, \"They have it now.\" Thompson also told GameSpot that he was not a \"pixelated piñata in a game.\" He ended by saying that the \"moral midgets\" at \"Penny Arcade\" had chosen \"the wrong target\" and \"I've been at this longer than he has.\" These vague threats have been deemed \"nothing to worry about\" by \"Penny Arcade\". The Seattle Police Department confirmed to GameSpot on October 21 that they had received a complaint from Thompson.\n\nOn October 21, 2005, Thompson claimed to have sent a letter to John McKay, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington, in an attempt to get the FBI involved. Thompson reiterated his claims of \"extortion\" and accuses \"Penny Arcade\" of using \"their Internet site and various other means to encourage and solicit criminal harassment\". \"Penny Arcade\" denies the charge of \"extortion\", noting that they paid the $10,000 to charity, and are asking nothing in return.\n\nThompson also contacted the office of Washington State Legislature Representative Mary Lou Dickerson, and her office confirms they asked John McKay to look into the matter. Thompson has not clarified how he is being \"extorted,\" but accuses \"Penny Arcade's\" Mike Krahulik of soliciting Florida Bar complaints against him through Mike posting the Florida Bar's link on \"Penny Arcade's\" website. The link, however, is in a post asking fans to stop sending letters to the Bar because the Bar is fully aware of the current situation.\n\nOn October 27, 2005, the Seattle PD acknowledged receipt of Thompson's complaint, although after the initial reading of the letter they noted that the complaint appeared to be a civil, rather than criminal matter. They passed the letter on to the chief of their criminal investigations bureau for review.\n\nOn April 4, 2006, Thompson commented on the online gaming blog Joystiq, suggesting a game in which the editors and writers for the blog were murdered. Thompson claimed that being targeted would let the writers know what it felt like to be a police officer or a woman after the release of \"Grand Theft Auto\".\n\nInstead, Joystiq actively challenged its readers to develop such a game over the course of several weeks, running a contest with a prize of merchandise as incentive.

It measures about 4 in x 2.3 in and is in relatively pristine condition. Because of its narrowness, each line averages only c. 4–7 cuneiform characters in the Akkadian language.\n\nLetter EA 364 is one of the Amarna letters, about 300, numbered up to EA 382, mid 14th century BC, about 1350 BC and 25? years later, correspondence. The initial corpus of letters were found at Akhenaten's city Akhetaten, in the floor of the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.\n\nLetter EA 364 is from Ayyab to the Pharaoh, and is a response to the King (pharaoh) referring to a letter from the Pharaoh's messenger Tahmassi; Ayyab, the governing-man (often—(\"who/which\"-(ša))-\"man, city\")-Aštartu, is in control of one of the city-states in Canaan, and is stating his continued support of guarding his city, (and his region), after 3 regional cities were taken in warfare-hostilities.\n\nThe following English language text, and Akkadian is from Rainey, 1970, \"El Amarna Tablets, 359-379\":\n\nAkkadian:\n\nMoran's non-linear letter English language translation (translated from the French language):\n\nEA 364, Obverse:\n\nEA 364, continued Bottom, Reverse:\n\nOften personal names (PN) contain special cuneiform characters, and Tahmassi's name, spelled \"Atahmaya\" is an example of such. Sign \"tah\" (based on the more common \"qab\"-\"GABA\"-) can be seen in line 13—\"A-TaH-Ma-iYa\". (In the photo of EA 364 (obverse), the cuneiform signs become out-of-focus below lines 9 and 10.) The \"tah\" sign has only one use, as \"tah\", in the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", (12 times).\n\nBecause the name \"Tahmassi's\" comes from the Egyptian god Ptah (a creator god), the origion of the spelling and pronunciation of \"ptah\" can be guessed. \"Ptah-mine\", \"Ptah (is) mine\", \"Mine, My (God) is Ptah\", with \"-iya\" the suffix for 'my' still used in the languages of present day.\n\nThe \"en\" cuneiform sign, is used frequently in the Canaanite city-state letters to the Pharaoh for \"Lord\", (as EN (lord Sumerogram)), for Akkadian language bēlu. It is often part of the phrase \"King-Lord-mine\", \"LUGAL-EN-ia\"; a variant often in the letters (because of the addendum of an RI sign) contains an equivalent for LUGAL, \"ŠÀR\", for (LUGAL=king=Šarru), \"ŠÀR-RI, EN-ia\". Also, singly \"Lord-mine\" is used in some letter texts, and often with \"alphabeltic\" spellings of \"bēlu\" instead of using \"EN\": in EA 364, (above)–line (end l.3) and 4 state: \"...at feet 'Lord(EN)-mine' \".\n\nIn letter EA 364, the common variety of many sub-varieties is used, . It shows distinctly in lines 364:1,4,7, and 11 the two verticals-right, with the angled wedges at their base. The lone vertical at center-left is equally tall (not on all Amarna letters), and strikingly visible, and without the angled wedge at the base. Some letters have an additional wedge at the base (making it the 3rd, 'vertical-with-wedge-base').\n\n\n\n"}

A number of ghost stories and urban legends have become associated with the road, including the fictional deaths of a troop of Boy Scouts. The area has been the subject of several paranormal investigations, and has been a 'haunt' for youths hoping to experience a paranormal event. The land surrounding Boy Scout Lane is now privately owned and is off limits to the general public.\n\nBoy Scout Lane is in the Town of Linwood, Portage County, Wisconsin. It is located west of the Wisconsin River Golf Club, on West River Drive (West), and is situated between Cemetery Road and Little Chicago Road. It is unpaved and about long.\n\nThe road was named Boy Scout Lane because the land that it is located near land was once owned by the Boy Scouts of America, who planned to use the land to build a Scout camp. Although the camp was never constructed and the land remains woodland, the name was still used.\n\nAccording to a local urban legend, the road is named for a troop of Boy Scouts who were killed while on a camping trip in the 1950s or 60s. In some variations the murderer is the troop's Scoutmaster. In others it is their bus driver. In other versions of the legend, a small group of Scouts leave their camp during the night and accidentally drop their lantern, resulting in a forest fire that kills the entire troop.\n\nOther variations of the story exist including one in which the Scouts are killed after their bus crashes or accidentally catches fire. There is also a version in which the Scouts vanish without explanation and are never found. In some versions of the legend, two Boy Scouts escaped the fate of the rest of the troop and tried to find help, only to become lost in the woods where they die of starvation and/or exposure.

{"id": "22512949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22512949", "title": "Branko Cvetkovic", "text": "Branko Cvetkovic\n\nBranko Cvetkovic (born 1951), a Slovenian photographer known for his philosophically conceptualized approach to photography. Working mostly with large-format cameras, his architecture photography is minimalistically structured. From symmetry he opens up the space perspective to deconstructivism, and in art there is a transition to a non-perspective suprematist plane, thus coinciding with abstract expressionism. Besides space, his main concern is the phenomenon of light itself, the two basic postulates in photography.\n\nBranko Cvetkovic was born on April 15, 1951 in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, former Yugoslavia. He graduated in political economics under the mentorship of one of the best known Yugoslavian economists, France Cerne, at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Ljubljana. After working for various research institutions he served as an expert for manpower for the government of the Republic of Seychelles. He was also appointed as an expert for the United Nations organization Habitat.\n\nHe started to become involved with photography in 1986 and 1987 in the Seychelles. This coincidental beginning and later obsession was triggered by his fascination with light – a reminiscence of a childhood awareness of the light on the houses of his birthplace – and an emerging sensitivity to fine art, dating from his student years. Nevertheless, his first two independent, and still amateur, projects were the Creole houses and a continuous conceptual recording of the light above the island Silhouette. After his return home he abandoned his work as an economist and went on to work as an artist, a profession in his belief of greater importance and of greater and lasting value. He started to work professionally in photography; upgrading his technical skills and perception of fine art. Since 1990 he has been a free-lance photographer working mainly in architecture, industry and art; in the early years he also dealt with creative and artistic management and design.\n\nIn the years 1992 – 98 the several works were awarded, where Cvetkovic played a role as creative, conceptual or art director, co-designer and photographer.\n\nBranko Cvetkovic resides in Ljubljana.\n\nInitially, his approaches had evolved intuitively, then there was a cognition process of photography and art, involving analyses of conceptual art and minimalistic expression in Bauhaus modernism and avant-garde upgraded by Russian constructivism. In architectural photography he radicalized certain conceptual and functionalist approaches which can be compared with or are similar to those of the Bechers’ Düsseldorf school. He worked conceptually and was particularly devoted to defining spatial light and transmitting and upgrading the form or architecture of space. In spite of his highly objective aspirations in this period he could be considered a constructivist.\n\nIn his late period he established a philosophical idea of Non-Space as a totality of abstract space. In the fine art sense he transformed space into an abstract expressive image of the (suprematist) plane as the ultimate transformation of three-dimensional space into nil or zero dimension. Therefore, he discovered his artistic ambitions in the field of abstract expressionism.\n\nIn his early studies Cvetkovic found himself mainly occupied with the issue of the complexity of light and image, its disintegration into layers with various depths of field, in order to envisage a new image and to formulate or to frame it on the Bauhaus modernist plane.\n\nIn this period (1990-1995) he dealt with minimalistic and conceptual topics summed up in projects: Rocks and Water, Light within Seashells, Waves and Series of Seawater Abstractions. His projects continued with almost abstract cycles in the Bauhaus constructivist manner: Lux Plantarum (1997) and Light of Shadow – Drawing of Form (1998), both exhibited in Ljubljana.\n\nThis was the introduction leading to his most complex opus of industrial photography, still defined by the Bauhaus spirit and undertaken at the industrial premises of the Akrapovic firm in the years 1997 and 1998, continuing in 2002 and 2003: Tubes, Chinese Cosmos, Abstractions and Bauhaus . His final creation in this field was in 8x10 inches LF and was named Locomotives (2005).\n\nIn architectural photography Cvetkovic has made his way from structuralism to deconstructivism. At his early stage of involvement in photography, Cvetkovic had been posing himself the question of the construction of the constructivist frame on the one hand and on the other the problem of defining or constructing light within space. Thus, his architectural photography is minimalistic, rationalized and architecturally schematic. A reading of light is defined by the architectural shell itself. With this approach he autonomously developed modernist functionalist architectural photography and only in this way did he find himself side by side with the developing Düsseldorf school.\n\nHis first exhibition The Old Power Station in Ljubljana in 1992, was the first in this series, as well as the continuation of his project of old industrial buildings, namely Rog and the old brick factory of Ljubljana, which were exhibited in 1997 under the title Past Spaces. In the old power station Cvetkovic did not only make a so-called archeological inventory of the building, he also introduced the archeology of spatial light. He had researched light, as one of the critics put it. In Past Spaces (1997), he had already presented architecture by sequencing the framing and \"new\" construction of the perspective by overturning the areas or planes of a picture similar to Russian constructivism.\n\nRadical in his concept, Cvetkovic was presented as an architectural photographer in the full complexity of his work in 1996, with his exhibition of Plecnik`s Marketplace. In this exhibition he broke with the contemporary post-modernist tradition of representing architecture in Slovenia by replacing it with a functionalist overview. The scheme and the structure of the photographic work were outlined by him during the period of the renovation of Plecnik’s buildings. He shaped the Plecnik’s architecture in doctrinaire typology by using the symmetrical minimalist concept, perspective-corrected images of the architectural structures, consistently outlined only by a diffused non-shadow light, which became the light of an object itself. This was the method the photographer strictly implemented during the period coinciding with the emerging Düsseldorf school. The whole exhibition took place at the Municipal Gallery of Ljubljana and was accompanied by the artist’s monograph. It paved the way for him to the most important cultural and professional Slovenian institutions, whilst he became distinguished with his interpretation of the architecture of their home buildings, their reconstructions and renovations. The collections of his photographs are represented as the core of the archives of the National University Library, Cankar Cultural Centre, Slovenian Philharmonic Hall, Slovenian National Opera and Ballet, Municipal Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana, the Institution for Public Health, House of Constitutional Law, etc.\n\nCvetkovic completed extensive work on Plecnik`s architecture of the National and University Library of Slovenia (NUK) in the years 1998–1999 and 2003. The originals were taken by large format 4x5 inch and 13x18 cm Sinar P2 and Hasselblad 6x6. The lead and the principle of the photography and composition are based on the Düsseldorf school doctrine. In some cases sequential photographing was also taken into account. Truly exceptional is the photograph of the main entrance façade; for the first time in the history of the NUK this is seen and established in one perspective-corrected picture, actually amalgamated from three vertically positioned originals in 13x18 cm format. Because of the narrow street and the extent of the façade, this had hitherto been an unattainable, a constant enigmatic frustration never to be overcome.\n\nCvetkovic has approached Plecnik not only in his creative aspiration, but also ethically in his unconditional aspiration to perfection. In each of the photographed spaces his interest was also in its symbolic meaning. For him, in his picturing the Plecnik`s architecture, the basic message was the fine art transmittance of architecture with the sequential construction of the planes with the typical reduction of the light and the maximal objectivistic and plastic construction of the space, thus positioning the Plecnik`s sequencing of the classical, almost renaissance architectural space.\n\nAlmost the contrary has been achieved with Cvetkovic`s architectural photography in his introspective survey of the Slovenian National Opera and Ballet Theatre in Ljubljana as a paradigmatic amphitheatric space. This extensive work was accomplished in the years 2002, 2003, 2007, 2007-2011.\n\nIn 2004 Cvetkovic exhibited his new de-constructivist series entitled Deconstruction of Light – Sequential Constructions of the Space Planes: the Spaces of Spaces, shortly deKons. The oeuvre started to emerge during the renovation of the Auersperg palace Turjaska palaca. The author departed from the Düsseldorf school presentation. He radicalized the classical upright perspective; he controlled the architectural image by framing it in the sense of Russian constructivism, thus opening up the way to abstraction. This transformation enabled Cvetkovic to be liberated from the classical principle.\n\nIndirect recording of light within the shell of the architecture as an analytical tool necessarily makes it possible to create a new abstract quality – the quality of the light as a means of the sequential decomposition of spatial framings. The author gives the explanation himself: \"Therefore we do not only achieve the effect of constructing the perspective by overturning planes in two-dimensional space (in constructivist sense) but deconstruction of perspective and disintegration of planes by the act of deconstruction of light. Inversely that means creation or construction of a new abstract deconstructed space.\" \n\nAnother constructivist project entitled Backstage was recorded in Cankar Cultural Centre (Cankarjev dom) in 2004 and 2005. Cvetkovic develops his idea of abstract space as a dynamic construction never defined, yet firmly built on its groundwork base, but varied in its contingency forms upon the physical optics of various projects. These are the spaces of Backstage, which both serve and model the creativity. The static picture of a construction-based form is varied to a dynamic deconstructed space, decomposed into planes; the planes that host the people as creative figures and momentary actors.\n\nBeside the main opus, there are two special series in Backstage, denoting solely the Stage as a Podium and as a Hall. The first is designed to comply with the idea of Stage as Pollock’s fine art image plane. Cvetkovic’s photographic plane is marked by unnumbered timeless coloured traces that physically mark and embody human action on the stage for ever. The other series denotes a hall as a deconstructed space of a suprematist Malevich square plane. Each is determined and sponsored by the unique colour of the square plane. Both series are initiated and denoted by a black square – seven minutes exposure in the totally dark space of the stage – as a prelude to an abstract image of indefinable expectation on the part of the spectator.\n\nAccording to several art critics, Cvetkovic reached the heights in the programmed course with the En Face exhibition in the National Gallery of Slovenia (Narodna galerija) in 2005, accompanied with the monograph – catalogue. \nLarge format photographs with substantial enlargements, some of them digitally composed into one unified frame enlargement, speak of the façade and its embodying the technical, cultural, social and historical artefact. The façade shows itself as a connotation and determiner of the place. Quoting the author, \"the only one building of certain space is the unicum of that place and that place alone becomes the only one place of that certain building\". From this intentionally prefixed tautology it may be established that in his work, Cvetkovic, who has been constantly loyal to his conceptual reasoning in the photographic sense of the matter, wider in the fields of fine art and theory, has approached the Düsseldorf school most closely.\n\nTo finalize the representation of Cvetkovic oeuvre attention should be drawn to his outstanding management of space and perspective correction and his ability to impart to the image in his photography the archetypes, the timelessness and the entireness of the structured spaces as a whole or things as architectures by themselves.\n\nIn the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 Cvetkovic concluded his complex and extensive project entitled NON-SPACE / ZeroSPACE. The author goes through abstraction to the field of abstract expressionism, both conceptually and philosophically, both in the elaboration and execution of his work on 5x7 and 8x10 large format film originals.\nHis philosophical reductionist idea of non-space is presented as an antithesis of real space. Real space has converged into anti-space, into a totality of absolute abstraction of space which in terms of fine art, after the exclusion of perspective, light and real time, denotes an abstract expressive plane as a final transformation of space. In this way the basic three fine art issues are once again introduced into modernist art discourse. These are: perspective, light and the concept of space. The transformation of space into plane confirms and challenges the idea of a black and white square plane. Cvetkovic is radical in developing his thesis. He confronts his conception of the basic fine art principles with the most human abstract and universal experience; the human comprehension of death. Within this conceptual context, with utmost consistency and vigorousness, the author elaborates his exceptional frames of vast seascapes, transforming these huge spaces into vast abstract minimalistic planes; the screens and the images are ones that have not yet been encountered in Slovenian art. \nThe main idea is the gradual elimination of perspective and sublime transition of space to plane – \"screen\". Series called Screens, with many derivations, colours and transformations, accentuate abstraction of space to an expressive two-dimensional plane. The last are those of the \"Black and white plane\" as the final synthesis of denomination to NON-SPACE│ZeroSPACE, concluded as a total abstraction with no dimension.\n\nIn spite of total reduction and final darkness, the definitive will towards total liberation, as the idea of huge space in open sky and light, emerges. It could be termed heaven`s light or simply the big magic light, which outlasts and illuminates everything in all its material transformations. This light is the symbol of human mental eternal space.\n\nWhite lights; open ocean spaces with vast light ruptures and immense light rays, and even bigger light chasms that literally swallow and dematerialize everything by colouring it into white dazzling lights, are the founding idea for the project that also opens up for the terminating idea of the Heaven Lights.\n\nMuch earlier than impressionists, and later abstract expressionists, William Turner was the first painter of romantic and symbolic heritage, who was mainly preoccupied with the idea of light. In his paintings: , 1812, Shade and Darkness – the Evening of the Deluge, 1843, Light and Colour – the Morning after the Deluge, 1843, he tried to introspect and consume the light as a spiritual category in its mysticism and abstraction of its highest spiritual elevation. In the first painting, the light and the sun rest under the firmament of clouds shaped like a cathedral vault. Respectively, in other above-mentioned paintings, the light is embodied in the circle that reflects the gaze into a dome. Turner`s approach gave to the phenomenon of light the power for elevation that absorbs the spectator.\n\nIn the author’s opinion, these are fantastic grounds for deviation into abstract, non-material, non-objective matter; confrontation of photography with the essential and most basic constitutional matter, Light. This is the reason why his project, based on introspection of sublime light, elevation from darkness into the light, and spiritual absorption, a voyage that is traced by light, could be handled and tracked by photography and its basic tool, Light.\n\nCvetkovic’s work is based on the movement of the large format 8x10 in. camera which, with its resolution power of 8x10 in. film and long exposures, can absorb the light in its abstract images.\n\nPhotography is rigorously objectivistic. Symmetries are their basic orientation points. The notion of expressiveness is accentuated by perspective and the absence of it, respectively. The series of Screen and Plane coincide with abstract expressionism. In addition, the presentiment and sensation of huge minimalistic planes with expressive supernatural connotation have to possess monumental momentum. Their modem is an abstract pattern which we, unawares, inhibit in ourselves. White Lights is mainly based on symmetries and very strong reflective light on the ocean.\n\nCvetkovic started to exhibit in 1992. His major conceptual and programmed solo exhibitions are contextualized within the description of his work.\n\n\n\nTill 2006 Cvetkovic`s exhibitions were strictly solo and were organized and curated by himself. After his major exhibition in Slovenian National Gallery in 2005 he started to associate with Photon Gallery based in Ljubljana. Between 2010 and 2016 he was represented by Prom-Galerie, Munich.\n\nCvetkovic`s works are held in numerous collections and archives of Slovenian cultural institutions and by private owners, including National University Library, Cankar Cultural Centre, Slovenian National Opera and Ballet, Slovenian Philharmonic Hall, Municipal Museum and Galleries of Ljubljana, the Institution of Public Health, House of Constitutional Law, Porsche, The Carmen Würth Collection Museum Würth Kunzelsau etc.\n\nCvetkovic has extensive bibliography with more than 125 references in Slovenian Online Bibliographic System COBISS. His most important books are: \n\nIn the years 1992 – 1996 the following works were awarded, where Cvetkovic played a role as creative, conceptual or art director, co-designer and photographer. \n"}

The term can be considered pejorative, though it is sometimes embraced.\n\nWomen who have cats have long been associated with the concept of spinsterhood. In more recent decades, the concept of a cat lady has been associated with \"romance-challenged (often career-oriented) women\". Specifically, it has also been embraced by lesbian and queer women.\n\nA cat lady may also be an animal hoarder who keeps large numbers of cats without having the ability to properly house or care for them. They may be ignorant about their situation, or generally unaware of their situation. People who are aware of it are not normally considered cat ladies.\n\nSome writers, celebrities, and artists have challenged the gender-based \"Crazy Cat Lady\" stereotype, and embraced the term to mean an animal lover or rescuer who cares for one or multiple cats, and who is psychologically healthy.\n\nThe documentary \"Cat Ladies\" (2009) tells the stories of four women whose lives became dedicated to their cats. The film was directed by Christie Callan-Jones and produced by Chocolate Box Entertainment, originally for TVOntario. It was an official selection at the 2009 Hot Docs Festival, Silverdocs Festival, and San Francisco's DocFest.\n\nNaftali Berrill, Ph.D., Director of the New York Center for Neuropsychology and Forensic Behavioral Science told AOL Health, \"These may be people who have a very hard time expressing themselves to other people. They may find the human need for affection is met most easily through a relationship with a pet.\" This devotion can sometimes signal mental or emotional issues such as depression.\n\nRecent research indicates a link between the parasite \"Toxoplasma gondii\", which sexually reproduces exclusively in cats, and numerous psychiatric conditions, including obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia. The compulsive hoarding of cats, a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), has long been associated with \"crazy cat ladies\". Mass media has drawn on this stereotype to coin the term \"crazy cat lady syndrome\" to refer to the association between \"T. gondii\" and psychiatric conditions.\n\n\nCat ladies in popular culture include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the grandson of Maximilian Berlitz, who founded the Berlitz Language Schools. As a child, Charles was raised in a household in which (by his father's orders) every relative and servant spoke to Charles in a different language: he reached adolescence speaking eight languages fluently. In adulthood, he recalled having had the childhood delusion that every human being spoke a different language, wondering why he did not have his own language like everyone else in his household. His father spoke to him in German, his grandfather in Russian, and his nanny in Spanish.\n\nHe began working for the family language school, The Berlitz School of Languages, during college breaks. The publishing house, of which he was vice president, sold, among other things, tourist phrase books and pocket dictionaries, several of which he authored. He also played a key role in developing record and tape language courses. He left the company in the late 1960s, not long after he sold the company to publishing firm Crowell, Collier & Macmillan. He graduated \"magna cum laude\" from Yale University.\n\nBerlitz was a writer on paranormal phenomena. He wrote a number of books on Atlantis. In his book \"The Mystery of Atlantis\", he claimed Atlantis was real, based on his interpretation of geophysics, psychic studies, classical literature, tribal lore, and archeology. He also attempted to link the Bermuda Triangle to Atlantis. He claimed to have located Atlantis undersea in the area of the Bermuda Triangle. He was also an ancient astronaut proponent who believed that extraterrestrials had visited earth.\n\nBerlitz spent 13 years on active duty in the U.S. Army, mostly in intelligence. In 1950, he married Valerie Seary, with whom he had two children, a daughter Lin, and son, Marc. He died in 2003 at the age of 90 at University Hospital in Tamarac, Florida.\n\nBerlitz's statements about the Bermuda Triangle and the Philadelphia Experiment were heavily criticized by researchers and scientists for their inaccuracy. He has also drawn criticism for ignoring possible natural explanations and promoting pseudoscientific ideas.\n\nLarry Kusche has accused Berlitz of fabricating evidence and inventing mysteries that have no basis in fact.\n\n\n\n"}

His works have significantly influenced the Western scholarship of the medieval Caucasus.\n\nCyril Toumanoff was born in Saint Petersburg into a family of the military officer of the Russian army. His father came of the princely family of Tumanishvili from Georgia, whose ancestors had emigrated from their original homeland in Cilician Armenia in the 15th century. This family is on the list of the Georgian princes that was attached to the Treaty of Georgievsk concluded between the Georgian king Erekle II and the Russian empress Catherine II in 1783. On December 6, 1850, the Tumanishvili were officially enrolled on the Russian Empire's list of Georgian princely families as knyaz Tumanov.

{"id": "8504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8504", "title": "Dublin", "text": "Dublin\n\nDublin (; ) is the capital and largest city in Ireland. Dublin is in the province of Leinster on the east coast of Ireland, at the mouth of the River Liffey and bordered on the south by the Wicklow Mountains. The city has an urban area population of 1,173,179. The population of the Dublin Region (formerly County Dublin), , was 1,347,359 and the population of the Greater Dublin area was 1,904,806.\n\nThere is archaeological debate regarding precisely where Dublin was established by Celtic-speaking people in the 7th century AD. Later expanded as a Viking settlement, the Kingdom of Dublin, the city became Ireland's principal settlement following the Norman invasion. The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second largest city in the British Empire before the Acts of Union in 1800. Following the partition of Ireland in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State, later renamed Ireland.\n\nDublin is a historical and contemporary centre for education, the arts, administration and industry. As of 2018, Dublin was listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) as a global city, with a ranking of \"Alpha -\", which places it amongst the top thirty cities in the world. \n\nThe name \"Dublin\" comes from the Irish word \"Dubhlinn\", early Classical Irish /, from (, , ) meaning \"black, dark\", and () \"pool\", referring to a dark tidal pool. This tidal pool was located where the River Poddle entered the Liffey, on the site of the castle gardens at the rear of Dublin Castle. In Modern Irish the name is \"Duibhlinn\", and Irish rhymes from County Dublin show that in Dublin Leinster Irish it was pronounced \"Duílinn\" . The original pronunciation is preserved in the names for the city in other languages such as Old English , Old Norse , modern Icelandic and modern Manx as well as Welsh . Other localities in Ireland also bear the name \"Duibhlinn\", variously anglicized as Devlin, Divlin and Difflin. Historically, scribes using the Gaelic script wrote \"bh\" with a dot over the \"b\", rendering Duḃlinn or Duiḃlinn. Those without knowledge of Irish omitted the dot, spelling the name as \"Dublin\". Variations on the name are also found in traditionally Gaelic-speaking areas of Scotland (Gàidhealtachd, cognate with Irish Gaeltachta), such as \"An Linne Dhubh\" (\"the black pool\"), which is part of Loch Linnhe.\n\nIt is now thought that the Viking settlement was preceded by a Christian ecclesiastical settlement known as \"Duibhlinn\", from which \"Dyflin\" took its name. Beginning in the 9th and 10th century, there were two settlements where the modern city stands. The Viking settlement of about 841, \"Dyflin\", and a Gaelic settlement, Áth Cliath (\"ford of hurdles\") further up river, at the present day Father Mathew Bridge (also known as Dublin Bridge), at the bottom of Church Street. ', meaning \"town of the hurdled ford\", is the common name for the city in modern Irish. ' is a place name referring to a fording point of the River Liffey near Father Mathew Bridge. \"\" was an early Christian monastery, believed to have been in the area of Aungier Street, currently occupied by Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church. There are other towns of the same name, such as \"Àth Cliath\" in East Ayrshire, Scotland, which is Anglicised as Hurlford.\n\nThe area of Dublin Bay has been inhabited by humans since prehistoric times, but the writings of Ptolemy (the Greco-Roman astronomer and cartographer) in about AD 140 provide possibly the earliest reference to a settlement there. He called it \"Eblana polis\" ().\n\nDublin celebrated its 'official' millennium in 1988, meaning the Irish government recognised 988 as the year in which the city was settled and that this first settlement would later become the city of Dublin.\nIt is now thought the Viking settlement of about 841 was preceded by a Christian ecclesiastical settlement known as \"Duibhlinn\", from which \"Dyflin\" took its name. Beginning in the 9th and 10th century, there were two settlements which later became the modern Dublin. The subsequent Scandinavian settlement centred on the River Poddle, a tributary of the Liffey in an area now known as Wood Quay. The Dubhlinn was a pool on the lowest stretch of the Poddle, used to moor ships. This pool was finally fully infilled during the early 18th century, as the city grew. The Dubhlinn lay where the Castle Garden is now located, opposite the Chester Beatty Library within Dublin Castle. \"Táin Bó Cuailgne\" (\"The Cattle Raid of Cooley\") refers to \"Dublind rissa ratter Áth Cliath\", meaning \"Dublin, which is called Ath Cliath\".\n\nDublin was established as a Viking settlement in the 10th century and, despite a number of attacks by the native Irish, it remained largely under Viking control until the Norman invasion of Ireland was launched from Wales in 1169. It was upon the death of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn in early 1166 that Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht, proceeded to Dublin and was inaugurated \"King of Ireland\" without opposition. Arguably, he was the primitive undebated full king of Ireland and also the only Gaelic one.\n\nAccording to some historians, part of the city's early economic growth is attributed to a trade in slaves. Slavery in Ireland and Dublin reached its pinnacle in the 9th and 10th centuries. Prisoners from slave raids and kidnappings, which captured men, women and children, brought revenue to the Celtic Irish Sea raiders, as well as to the Vikings who had initiated the practice. The victims came from Wales, England, Normandy and beyond.\n\nThe King of Leinster, Diarmait Mac Murchada, after his exile by Ruaidhrí, enlisted the help of Strongbow, the Earl of Pembroke, to conquer Dublin. Following Mac Murrough's death, Strongbow declared himself King of Leinster after gaining control of the city. In response to Strongbow's successful invasion, King Henry II of England affirmed his ultimate sovereignty by mounting a larger invasion in 1171 and pronounced himself Lord of Ireland. Around this time, the \"county of the City of Dublin\" was established along with certain liberties adjacent to the city proper. This continued down to 1840 when the barony of Dublin City was separated from the barony of Dublin. Since 2001, both baronies have been redesignated as the \"City of Dublin\".\n\nDublin Castle, which became the centre of Norman power in Ireland, was founded in 1204 as a major defensive work on the orders of King John of England. Following the appointment of the first Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1229, the city expanded and had a population of 8,000 by the end of the 13th century. Dublin prospered as a trade centre, despite an attempt by King Robert I of Scotland to capture the city in 1317. It remained a relatively small walled medieval town during the 14th century and was under constant threat from the surrounding native clans. In 1348, the Black Death, a lethal plague which had ravaged Europe, took hold in Dublin and killed thousands over the following decade.\n\nDublin was incorporated into the English Crown as the Pale, which was a narrow strip of English settlement along the eastern seaboard. The Tudor conquest of Ireland in the 16th century spelt a new era for Dublin, with the city enjoying a renewed prominence as the centre of administrative rule in Ireland. Determined to make Dublin a Protestant city, Queen Elizabeth I of England established Trinity College in 1592 as a solely Protestant university and ordered that the Catholic St. Patrick's and Christ Church cathedrals be converted to Protestant.\n\nThe city had a population of 21,000 in 1640 before a plague in 1649–51 wiped out almost half of the city's inhabitants. However, the city prospered again soon after as a result of the wool and linen trade with England, reaching a population of over 50,000 in 1700.\n\nAs the city continued to prosper during the 18th century, Georgian Dublin became, for a short period, the second largest city of the British Empire and the fifth largest city in Europe, with the population exceeding 130,000. The vast majority of Dublin's most notable architecture dates from this period - the Four Courts, the Custom House, Temple Bar and Grafton Street are some of the few remaining areas that were not affected by the wave of Georgian reconstruction and maintained their medieval character.\n\nDublin grew even more dramatically during the 18th century, with the construction of many new districts and buildings, such as Merrion Square, Parliament House and the Royal Exchange. The Wide Streets Commission was established in 1757 at the request of Dublin Corporation to govern architectural standards on the layout of streets, bridges and buildings. In 1759, the Guinness brewery was founded; and would eventually grow to become the largest brewery in the world and the largest employer in Dublin.\n\nDublin suffered a period of political and economic decline during the 19th century following the Acts of Union 1800, under which the seat of government was transferred to the Westminster Parliament in London. The city played no major role in the Industrial Revolution, but remained the centre of administration and a transport hub for most of the island. Ireland had no significant sources of coal, the fuel of the time, and Dublin was not a centre of ship manufacturing, the other main driver of industrial development in Britain and Ireland. Belfast developed faster than Dublin during this period on a mixture of international trade, factory-based linen cloth production and shipbuilding.\nThe Easter Rising of 1916, the Irish War of Independence, and the subsequent Irish Civil War resulted in a significant amount of physical destruction in central Dublin. The Government of the Irish Free State rebuilt the city centre and located the new parliament, the Oireachtas, in Leinster House. Since the beginning of Norman rule in the 12th century, the city has functioned as the capital in varying geopolitical entities: Lordship of Ireland (1171–1541), Kingdom of Ireland (1541–1800), as part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801–1922), and the Irish Republic (1919–1922). Following the partition of Ireland in 1922, it became the capital of the Irish Free State (1922–1937) and now is the capital of Ireland. One of the memorials to commemorate that time is the Garden of Remembrance.\n\nDublin was also a victim of the Northern Irish Troubles, although during this 30 year conflict, violence mainly occurred within Northern Ireland. However, the Provisional IRA drew some support from within the Republic, including from Dublin. A Loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, bombed the city during this time - notably in an atrocity known as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in which 34 people died, mainly in central Dublin.\n\nSince 1997, the landscape of Dublin has changed. The city was at the forefront of Ireland's economic expansion during the Celtic Tiger period, with private sector and state development of housing, transport and business. Following an economic decline during the Great Recession, Dublin has rebounded and as of 2017 has close to full employment but a significant problem with housing supply.\n\nFrom 1842, the boundaries of the city were comprehended by the baronies of Dublin City and the Barony of Dublin. In 1930, the boundaries were extended by the Local Government (Dublin) Act. Later, in 1953, the boundaries were again extended by the Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act.\n\nDublin City Council is a unicameral assembly of 63 members elected every five years from Local Election Areas. It is presided over by the Lord Mayor, who is elected for a yearly term and resides in Dublin's Mansion House. Council meetings occur at Dublin City Hall, while most of its administrative activities are based in the Civic Offices on Wood Quay. The party or coalition of parties with the majority of seats assigns committee members, introduces policies, and proposes the Lord Mayor. The Council passes an annual budget for spending on areas such as housing, traffic management, refuse, drainage, and planning. The Dublin City Manager is responsible for implementing City Council decisions but also has considerable executive power.\n\nAs the capital city, Dublin is the seat of the national parliament of Ireland, the Oireachtas. It is composed of the President of Ireland, Seanad Éireann as the upper house, and Dáil Éireann as the lower house. The President resides in Áras an Uachtaráin in Phoenix Park, while both houses of the Oireachtas meet in Leinster House, a former ducal palace on Kildare Street. It has been the home of the Irish parliament since the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922. The old Irish Houses of Parliament of the Kingdom of Ireland are located in College Green.\n\nGovernment Buildings house the Department of the Taoiseach, the Council Chamber, the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General. It consists of a main building (completed 1911) with two wings (completed 1921). It was designed by Thomas Manley Dean and Sir Aston Webb as the Royal College of Science. The First Dáil originally met in the Mansion House in 1919. The Irish Free State government took over the two wings of the building to serve as a temporary home for some ministries, while the central building became the College of Technology until 1989. Although both it and Leinster House were intended to be temporary locations, they became the permanent homes of parliament from then on.\n\nFor elections to Dáil Éireann, the city is divided into five constituencies: Dublin Central (3 seats), Dublin Bay North (5 seats), Dublin North-West (3 seats), Dublin South-Central (4 seats) and Dublin Bay South (4 seats). Nineteen TD's are elected in total.\n\nIn the 2016 general election the Dublin Region elected 14 Fine Gael, 7 Sinn Féin, 6 Fianna Fáil, 3 People Before Profit, 2 Socialist Party, 2 Labour Party, 2 Green Party, 1 Social Democrats and 7 Independent TDs.\n\nDublin is situated at the mouth of the River Liffey and encompasses a land area of approximately in east-central Ireland. It is bordered by a low mountain range to the south and surrounded by flat farmland to the north and west. The Liffey divides the city in two, between the Northside and the Southside. The Liffey bends at Leixlip from a northeasterly route to a predominantly eastward direction, and this point also marks the transition to urban development from more agricultural land usage.\n\nTwo secondary rivers further divide the city  – the River Tolka, running southeast into Dublin Bay, and the River Dodder running northeast to near the mouth of the Liffey, and these and the Liffey have multiple tributaries. A number of lesser rivers and streams also flow to the sea.\n\nTwo canals – the Grand Canal on the southside and the Royal Canal on the northside – ring the inner city on their way from the west and the River Shannon.\n\nA north-south division once traditionally existed, with the River Liffey as the divider. The Northside was generally seen as working class to middle class, while the Southside was seen as middle class to upper-middle class, although containing \"pockets\" of working class life. There have also been some social divisions evident between the coastal suburbs in the east of the city, and the newer developments further to the west.\n\nIn some tourism and real-estate marketing contexts, inner Dublin is sometimes divided into a number of \"quarters\" or districts. These include, the 'Medieval Quarter' (in the area of Dublin Castle, Christ Church and St Patrick's Cathedral and the old city walls), the 'Georgian Quarter' (including the area around St Stephen's Green, Trinity College, and Merrion Square), the 'Docklands Quarter' (around the Dublin Docklands and Silicon Docks), the 'Cultural Quarter' (around Temple Bar), and 'Creative Quarter' (between South William Street and George's Street).\n\nSimilar to much of the rest of northwestern Europe, Dublin experiences a maritime climate (\"Cfb\") with cool summers, mild winters, and a lack of temperature extremes. The average maximum January temperature is , while the average maximum July temperature is . On average, the sunniest months are May and June, while the wettest month is October with of rain, and the driest month is February with . Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year.\n\nDublin's sheltered location on the east coast makes it the driest place in Ireland, receiving only about half the rainfall of the west coast. Ringsend in the south of the city records the lowest rainfall in the country, with an average annual precipitation of , with the average annual precipitation in the city centre being . The main precipitation in winter is rain; however snow showers do occur between November and March. Hail is more common than snow. The city experiences long summer days and short winter days. Strong Atlantic winds are most common in autumn. These winds can affect Dublin, but due to its easterly location, it is least affected compared to other parts of the country. However, in winter, easterly winds render the city colder and more prone to snow showers.\n\nIn the 20th century, smog and air-pollution were an issue in the city, precipitating a ban on bituminous fuels across Dublin. The ban was implemented in 1990 to address black smoke concentrations, that had been linked to cardiovascular and respiratory deaths in residents. Since the ban, non-trauma death rates, respiratory death rates and cardiovascular death rates have declined - by an estimated 350 deaths annually.\n\nDublin has many landmarks and monuments dating back hundreds of years. One of the oldest is Dublin Castle, which was first founded as a major defensive work on the orders of England's King John in 1204, shortly after the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, when it was commanded that a castle be built with strong walls and good ditches for the defence of the city, the administration of justice, and the protection of the King's treasure. Largely complete by 1230, the castle was of typical Norman courtyard design, with a central square without a keep, bounded on all sides by tall defensive walls and protected at each corner by a circular tower. Sited to the south-east of Norman Dublin, the castle formed one corner of the outer perimeter of the city, using the River Poddle as a natural means of defence.\nOne of Dublin's newest monuments is the Spire of Dublin, or officially titled \"Monument of Light\". It is a conical spire made of stainless steel and is located on O'Connell Street. It replaces Nelson's Pillar and is intended to mark Dublin's place in the 21st century. The spire was designed by Ian Ritchie Architects, who sought an \"Elegant and dynamic simplicity bridging art and technology\". The base of the monument is lit and the top is illuminated to provide a beacon in the night sky across the city. \n\nThe Book of Kells, located in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, is one of the city's most visited sites. The Book of Kells is an illustrated manuscript created by Irish monks circa 800 AD.

Public parks include the Phoenix Park, Herbert Park, St Stephen's Green, Saint Anne's Park and Bull Island. The Phoenix Park is about west of the city centre, north of the River Liffey. Its perimeter wall encloses , making it one of the largest walled city parks in Europe. It includes large areas of grassland and tree-lined avenues, and since the 17th century has been home to a herd of wild Fallow deer. The residence of the President of Ireland (Áras an Uachtaráin), which was built in 1751, is located in the park.

In 2009, Dublin was listed as the fourth richest city in the world by purchasing power and 10th richest by personal income. According to \"Mercer's 2011 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey\", Dublin is the 13th most expensive city in the European Union (down from 10th in 2010) and the 58th most expensive place to live in the world (down from 42nd in 2010). , approximately 874,400 people were employed in the Greater Dublin Area. Around 60% of people who are employed in Ireland's financial, ICT, and professional sectors are located in this area.\n\nA number of Dublin's traditional industries, such as food processing, textile manufacturing, brewing, and distilling have gradually declined, although Guinness has been brewed at the St. James's Gate Brewery since 1759. Economic improvements in the 1990s attracted a number of global pharmaceutical, information and communications technology companies to the city and Greater Dublin Area. Companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Yahoo!, Facebook, Twitter, Accenture and Pfizer now have European headquarters and/or operational bases in the city, with several located in enterprise clusters like the Digital Hub and Silicon Docks. This presence of these companies has driven economic expansion in the city and led to Dublin sometimes being referred to as the \"Tech Capital of Europe\".\n\nFinancial services have also become important to the city since the establishment of Dublin's International Financial Services Centre in 1987. More than 500 operations are approved to trade under the IFSC programme. The centre is host to half of the world's top 50 banks and to half of the top 20 insurance companies. Many international firms have established major headquarters in the city, such as Citibank. The Irish Stock Exchange (ISEQ), Internet Neutral Exchange (INEX) and Irish Enterprise Exchange (IEX) are also located in Dublin. Dublin has been positioned as one of the main cities vying to host Financial Services companies hoping to retain access to the Eurozone after Brexit.

Completed projects include the Convention Centre, the 3Arena, and the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2018, Dublin touched its lowest unemployment rate in a decade, when it fell down to 5.7% as reported by the Dublin Economic Monitor.\n\nThe road network in Ireland is primarily focused on Dublin. The M50 motorway, a semi-ring road which runs around the south, west and north of the city, connects important national primary routes to the rest of the country.

The tunnel connects Dublin Port and the M1 motorway close to Dublin Airport. The city is also surrounded by an inner and outer orbital route. The inner orbital route runs approximately around the heart of the Georgian city and the outer orbital route runs primarily along the natural circle formed by Dublin's two canals, the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal, as well as the North and South Circular Roads.\n\nThe 2016 TomTom Traffic Index ranked Dublin the 15th most congested city in the world and the 7th most congested in Europe.\n\nDublin is served by a network of nearly 200 bus routes which cover the city and suburbs. The majority of these are controlled by Dublin Bus, but a number of smaller companies also operate. Fares are generally calculated on a stage system based on distance travelled.

Commuter rail operates on the other four lines using Irish Rail diesel multiple units. In 2013, passengers for DART and Dublin Suburban lines were 16 million and 11.7 million, respectively (around 75% of all Irish Rail passengers).\n\nDublin once had an extensive system of trams but this was largely phased out by 1949. A new light rail system, often described as a tram system, the Luas, was launched in 2004, and is run by Transdev Ireland (under contract from Transport Infrastructure Ireland), carrying over 34 million passengers annually. The network consists of two interconnecting tram lines; the Red Line links the Docklands and city centre with the south-western suburbs of Tallaght and Saggart, while the Green Line connects northern inner city suburbs and the main city centre with suburbs to the south of the city including Sandyford and Brides Glen. Together these lines comprise a total 67 stations and of track. Construction of a 6 km extension to the Green Line, bringing it into the north of the city, commenced in June 2013 and was opened for passenger travel on December 9, 2017.\n\nA metro service is proposed under the name of Metrolink, and planned to run from Dublin's northside to Sandyford via Dublin Airport and St. Stephen's Green, with construction projected to start after 2021.\n\nDublin Connolly is connected by bus to Dublin Port and ferries run by Irish Ferries and Stena Line to Holyhead for connecting trains on the North Wales Coast Line to Chester, Crewe and London Euston.

The headquarters of Ireland's flag carrier Aer Lingus and regional airlines Stobart Air and CityJet are located there, and those of low-cost carrier Ryanair nearby. The airport offers a short and medium haul network, domestic services to regional airports in Ireland, and long-haul services to the United States, Canada, the Middle East and Hong Kong. Dublin Airport is the 11th busiest in the European Union, and by far the busiest airport on the island of Ireland.\n\nIn 2014, Dublin Airport was the 18th busiest airport in Europe, serving over 21 million passengers. By 2016 this increased to 27.9 million passengers passing through the airport, establishing an all-time record supported by growth in both short- and long-haul networks. In 2015 and 2016, transatlantic traffic grew, with 158 summer flights a week to North America, making it the sixth largest European hub for that route over the year. Transatlantic traffic was also the fastest-growing segment of the market for the airport in 2016, in which a 16% increase from 2015 brought the yearly number of passengers traveling between Dublin and North America to 2.9 million.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2016, Dublin Airport saw an increase of nearly 9.5 million passengers in its annual traffic, as the number of commercial aircraft movements has similarly followed a growth trend from 163,703 in 2013 to 191,233 in 2015.\n\nDublin is also served by Weston Airport and other small facilities, by a range of helicopter operators, and the military and some State services use Casement Aerodrome nearby.\n\nDublin is one of the primary centres of education in Ireland, and is home to three universities, Dublin Institute of Technology and a number of other higher education institutions.

In some legislatures the term refers to the longest continuously-serving member, while in others it refers to the oldest member. Recently, the term Mother of the House or Mother of Parliament has also been used, although the usage varies between countries; it is simply the female alternative to Father of the House, being applied when the relevant member is a woman.\n\nThe \"Father of the House\" is a title that is bestowed on the senior member of the House of Commons who has the longest continuous service. If two or more members have the same length of current uninterrupted service, then whoever was sworn in earliest, as listed in Hansard, is named as Father of the House. Traditionally, however, the qualification used for the Father of the House are not entirely clear and may have included the oldest member, the member with the longest aggregate service, or the member who entered the House longest ago.\n\nThe only formal duty of the Father of the House is to preside over the election of the Speaker of the House of Commons. However, the relevant Standing Order does not refer to this member by the title of \"Father of the House\", referring instead to the longest-serving member of the House present who is not a Minister of the Crown. Until 1971, the Clerk of the House of Commons presided over the election of the speaker. As the clerk is never a member, and therefore is not permitted to speak, he would silently stand and point at the Member who was to speak. However, this procedure broke down at the election of a new Speaker in 1971 and was changed upon the recommendation of a Select Committee.\n\nThe current Father of the House of Commons is Kenneth Clarke, Conservative MP for Rushcliffe, who began his continuous service at the 1970 general election. Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsover, also began continuous service at the 1970 general election, but was sworn in after Clarke.\n\nThe first recorded usage of the title dates back to 1816 an engraved portrait of Whitshed Keene by Charles\nPicart, dated 1 February. Henry Campbell-Bannerman was simultaneously Father of the House and Prime Minister from May 1907 until soon before his death during April 1908. On 13 June 2017 Harriet Harman was dubbed \"Mother of the House\" by Prime Minister Theresa May, in recognition of her status as longest continuously serving woman MP.\n\nThe title 'Father of the House' is not used in the House of Lords. The longest-serving member is recorded on the House website, though no duties or special distinctions are associated with the position the longest serving member is The Lord Denham (Conservative), who first took his seat on 13 December 1949 (having suceeded his father in the peerage the previous year). The House of Lords Act 1999 repealed the automatic right of hereditary peers to be members of the House of Lords; Denham was one of those elected to continue as a member under section 2 of the Act.\n\nIn Australia, the current member of the House of Representatives with the longest period of continuous service, whether a Minister or not, is known as \"Father of the House\". Similarly, the current member of the Senate with the longest period of continuous service is known as \"Father of the Senate\". The longer serving of the two Fathers is called \"Father of the Parliament\".\n\nAs in Britain, these terms have no official status. However, unlike Britain:\n\nSince 6 February 2015, Senator Ian Macdonald, who was first appointed during 1990, has been the Father of the Senate.\n\nPhilip Ruddock, who was first elected during 1973, was the Father of the House of Representatives and Father of the Parliament from 1 September 1998 until his retirement on 9 May 2016. He was succeeded by Senator Ian Macdonald as Father of the Parliament and Kevin Andrews as Father of the House.\n\nThe longest-serving member of the House of Commons who is not a cabinet minister is known as the Dean of the House, and presides over the election of the Speaker at the beginning of each Parliament. The same term is used for the equivalent position in the United States House of Representatives.\n\nStarting with the Frankfurter Nationalversammlung (Frankfurt Parliament) of 1848, all German parliaments had a father of the House, usually called \"Alterspräsident\" (President by right of age). This tradition was continued into the Weimar Republic and, after being discontinued in Nazi Germany, was resumed by the present Parliament (Bundestag), whose rules of procedure mandate that the father of the house presides over the Parliament (Bundestag) at the start of each legislative period.\n\nIn accordance with tradition, the Alterspräsident first ascertains himself that he is the oldest member of the Bundestag by stating his date of birth and asking if anyone is present who was born before this date. If no older member of the Bundestag is present (which is usually the case) he will formally declare that he indeed is the Alterspräsident and will start proceedings.\n\nAs acting President of the Bundestag (Bundestagspräsident) he delivers the first programmatic speech and supervises the election of the President of the Bundestag. He then yields his power to the newly elected President of the Bundestag, who will in turn supervise the elections of the Vice Presidents of the Bundestag.\n\nThe rules of order of the Bundestag also state that the Alterspräsident shall act as President of the Bundestag at any given time during a legislative period, if the whole Presidium (i.e. the President and the Vice Presidents of the Bundestag) is altogether unable to perform its duties.\n\nAs the Alterspräsident's opening speech usually draws a certain amount of public attention, the position has recently attracted controversy, when the Party of Democratic Socialism (the succcesor of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany) obtained the position by including aged independents (Stefan Heym in 1994, Fred Gebhardt in 1998) in their party lists. In 2017, the Bundestag changed its rules of procedure to have the member with the longest service in the Bundestag serve as father of the house, rather than the oldest member.\n\nIn Hong Kong, there is no such term as \"Father of the House\". Instead, the longest-serving member was termed the Senior Unofficial Member and was the highest-ranking unofficial member of the Executive Council and the Legislative Council until the title was abolished during 1995 and 1992 respectively.\n\nAfter the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong, James To became the de facto longest serving member of the Legislative Council since 2016 after several members who had been served since the 1st Legislative Council retired.\n\nIn Hungary, the term refers to the oldest member of the National Assembly (previously House of Representatives, the lower house). Before the open session, the senior chairperson and junior notaries review the mandates of all the elected MPs in addition to their own. He or she presides over the newly elected parliament until the appointment of the officials.\n\nIn the beginning of each Knesset, before the election of a permanent speaker, there is a temporary speaker. In the past it was the oldest member of Knesset, now it is the longest-serving member. Michael Eitan is the most recent Knesset member to serve in this capacity, doing so from February 24 - March 30, 2010. In 2013 it was Benyamin Ben-Eliezer who had this position, and during 2015, it was Amir Peretz.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the term Father of the Dáil is an unofficial title applied to the longest-serving Teachta Dála (TD) in Dáil Éireann. The current Father is the former Taoiseach and Fine Gael party leader, Enda Kenny, TD, since the retirement of Séamus Pattison at the 2007 general election. On a number of occasions two or more people have shared the position of Father of the Dáil.\n\nIn Malaysia the term \"Father of the House\" is rarely used. Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah who was elected during 1974, has been the longest serving MP in the Dewan Rakyat. He is also the current oldest serving MP aged .\n\nIn New Zealand, the term Father or Mother of the House, as an unofficial title, designates the longest-continuously serving MP of the House of Representatives. The Father of the House has no official role in Parliament. Former Cabinet Minister Nick Smith succeeded former Prime Minister Bill English as Father of the House when the latter resigned in March 2018, having served continuously since the 1990 general election.\n\nIn New Zealand's first election of , the electorate became the first to declare the election of a successful candidate, electing Hugh Carleton unopposed. In the subsequent General Assembly of 1854, Carleton liked to be known as the \"Father of the House\".\n\nNorway doesn't have such a tradition. In most cases the Stortingspresident or a member of the presidium from the previous term are asked to lead the proceedings until a new President is elected.\n\nTraditionally when a new Russian parliament is formed the eldest deputy opens and manages the first session until a chairman is elected. In the history of the post-Soviet Dumas these were:\n\nIn the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia, the oldest MP serves as the Acting Speaker presiding over the constitutive session, before the Speaker is elected.\n\nUntil his death on 23 March 2015, former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was the longest serving Member of Parliament (Tanjong Pagar) and thus the Father of the House. As of April 2015, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong is Father of the House, as the longest serving MP (from the district named Marine Parade).\n\nIn Sweden the Riksdagsordningen law states that the member of the Riksdag who has held his elected seat for the longest shall be the \"Ålderspresident\", which translates to \"President by age\". The Ålderspresident acts as speaker of the Riksdag after each election, before the Speaker of the Riksdag has been elected. The Ålderspresident also acts as speaker in case of hindrance on behalf of the Speaker and all three Deputy Speakers.\n\nMembers of the Riksdag who has held the position of Ålderspresident:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58922108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58922108", "title": "Government by Judiciary", "text": "Government by Judiciary\n\nGovernment by Judiciary is a 1977 book by constitutional scholar and law professor Raoul Berger which argues that the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution contrary to the original intent of the framers of this Amendment and that the U.S. Supreme Court has thus usurped the authority of the American people to govern themselves and decide their own destiny.\n\nIn this book, Berger argues that the Fourteenth Amendment should be interpreted based on the original intent of its draftsmen and that the sole purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to constitutionalize the Civil Rights Act of 1866. (Berger rejects the use of statements by critics of the Fourteenth Amendment to advance a broad reading of the Fourteenth Amendment--arguing that these statements were made to make the Fourteenth Amendment look scary and to defeat this Amendment.) Specifically, the purpose of that Act was to tear down the Black Codes in the post-Civil War Southern U.S. and to give the freedmen basic rights such as freedom of contract, the right to sue and be sued, to travel and work wherever they please, and to buy, sell, and own property. Berger argues that, in the view of its draftsmen, the 1866 Civil Rights Act did not require U.S. states to allow African-Americans to serve on juries, to vote, to intermarry with White people, or to go to the same schools that White people went to. Thus, Berger argues that numerous U.S. Supreme Court decisions based on the Fourteenth Amendment have been wrongly decided since they were decided contrary to the original intent of the Fourteenth Amendment. These decisions include the 1880 case Strauder v. West Virginia (which stated that African-Americans cannot be prohibited from serving on juries), the 1954 case Brown v. Board of Education (which struck down school segregation), the 1960s one person, one vote cases such as Reynolds v. Sims, and the 1967 case Loving v. Virginia (which struck down bans ointerracial marriage]]).\n\nBerger also criticizes the idea of substantive due process as being contrary to the intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment and argues that, contrary to the statements of John Bingham and Jacob Howard (whose views Berger argues were unorthodox in the 39th Congress), the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended to apply the U.S. Bill of Rights against the states. Finally, Berger defends the holding in the notorious 1896 case Plessy v. Ferguson and argues that the reason that \"Plessy has become a symbol of evil[] ... is because we impose 'upon the past a creature of our own imagining' instead of looking to 'contemporaries of the events we are studying.'\" Berger argues that \"Plessy merely reiterated what an array of courts had been holding for fifty years\"--starting with the 1849 Massachusetts Supreme Court case Roberts v. City of Boston (which upheld the constitutionality of segregated schools in Massachusetts).\n\nOn a separate note, Berger argues that the U.S. Congress and not the courts were meant to have the exclusive authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. In Berger's view, the courts would only be allowed to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment if the U.S. Congress was to delegate this authority to them.\n\nAfter this book was published, Berger spent twenty years responding to his critics--writing \"forty article-length rebuttals and one of book length.\"\n"}

In 1894 he published a dictionary of Anglo-Saxon words, which he followed up with complete verse and metrical translations of the poem. His 1901 translation was the tenth to be published in English; a metrical translation followed in 1914, and in 1940 was edited by Charles Leslie Wrenn.\n\nJohn Richard Clark Hall was born in 1855, and achieved both a Master of Arts and a Ph.D..\n\nHall published two translations of the Anglo-Saxon epic poem \"Beowulf\", in addition to multiple editions of \"A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary\". His first edition of the dictionary was published in 1894, and attempted to ease access by ordering entries by the words as they were actually spelled in common editions of Old English texts. As Hall himself acknowledged in the second edition that followed in 1916, however, this \"was admittedly an unscientific [approach], and opened the door to a good many errors and inconsistencies\". With the second edition he adopted the conventional method of using \"normalised\" entry words. A third edition followed in 1931, a reprinting with a supplement by Herbert Dean Meritt came in 1960, and this was itself reprinted in 1984.\n\nIn 1910, after publication of the first edition of his dictionary, Hall published a literal translation of \"Beowulf\". It was the tenth English translation of the work; the eighth, in 1892, had also been translated by a John Hall, John Lesslie Hall. He followed this up four years later with another translation, this time in metre.

This promise, that if two people who love each other and go to Tokyo University together they will live happily ever after, is what keeps Keitarō focused and determined, even though he can not remember the name or face of the girl with whom he made the promise to.\n\nAfter failing the entrance exams twice and becoming a second-year \"rōnin\" (a high school student who did not pass the college entrance exams), his parents kick him out of his house, forcing him to move into his grandmother Hinata's home in , a hot-springs village in Kanagawa Prefecture overlooking Sagami Bay. Hinata's residence is a hotel called the Hinata House, located at 1 Hinata Street; what he does not know at this time is that the hotel had been converted into a girls-only dormitory. Despite an embarrassing and painful run with the residents which almost forces him to leave, he stays upon finding out that Hinata has given him the title and deed to the Hinata establishment. As the new landlord and manager, he must oversee and maintain the residence, a fact which upsets the girls. Even though the girls think of him as a pervert, over time he wins them over with his good-natured personality and constant perseverance even under dire pressure. Whereas in the anime he has a skill for drawing, particularly women, in the manga his main specialty is cooking chocolate dishes; he even boasted in the second volume that his skill can easily match that of any real chef's. One of his favorite hobbies is collecting photobooth pictures, which are, however, almost only of himself (except for two of him with Naru).\n\nIn the manga, after a trip with Seta to the USA, Keitarō becomes a skilled martial artist. He is able to match Motoko and on occasion defeats her in battle. Under Seta's wing, he becomes an impressive archaeologist, gaining Seta's uncanny ability to pull artifacts out of the ground practically anywhere. However, he also adopted Seta's bad driving habits and as well suffers from night blindness. His growth in character is picked up by the girls, who begin to develop even larger crushes on him. His developing relationship with Naru is one of the focal points in the story.\n\nOn the fourth attempt (he failed a third time as the story goes on), he finally gets accepted into Tokyo U, then proposes to Naru. Despite attempts from the other girls to capture his heart, Keitarō's feelings for Naru are unwavering. In Chapter 121, it is revealed that she is the girl he made the promise to 15 years ago. He, Naru, and Mutsumi were all in that fateful sandbox and that Hinata says that he should hang onto \"that girl beside him,\" signifying Naru. He becomes a renowned archaeologist and successor to Seta's studies.\n\nAfter three years and a very long engagement the two finally get married. His luck, though, has not changed much as he is last seen being chased by Naru after accidentally tearing off her wedding dress while heading to their honeymoon though considering their expressions it is implied that this was done more as \"for old times sake\".\n\nKeitarō is extremely kind-hearted and can always be counted on to help out when a friend is in trouble. He has a well-meaning personality, is constantly friendly, dedicated to his studies, and has a genuine concern for all of his friends.\n\nHe is luckless around women and is the subject of their violent attacks whenever he accidentally sees them naked or trips and touches them inappropriately. Despite such savage beatings, he is incredibly resilient (even a rocket does not do real harm). There is a joke in Volume 12 of the Manga that Keitarō is gifted with immortality, when he tells Naru that she probably would not survive the fall but he would.\n\nAfter the few years time skip at the end of the manga it seems his behaviour become more like Seta's.\n"}

Perhaps some of the Chancellor's many landholdings around Autun are included in the vista. A haze covers a mountain range in the far distance. As in many Early Netherlandish paintings, the steepness of the hills and mountains is shown as much greater than that found locally, for dramatic effect.\nThe small garden with many flowers identifiable (including lilies, irises, paeonies and roses), visible just outside the columns, symbolizes Mary's virtues. Beyond, two male figures wearing chaperons are looking through the crenellations of what looks to be a fortified balcony or bridge. There has been speculation that they may represent van Eyck and an assistant, after the pattern of his Arnolfini Portrait. The figure on the right wears a similar red chaperon to the probable van Eyck self-portrait in the National Gallery, London. Near to them are two peacocks, symbols both of immortality and of pride, to which even a powerful man as Rolin might succumb. \n\nThe interior has complex light sources, typical of van Eyck, with light coming both from the central portico and the side windows. The chancellor, whose strong character is well rendered by the artist, is wearing a fur-lined, elegant garment; the Virgin, the same size as Rolin (rather a novelty in comparison to the Gothic painting tradition), is instead covered by a red mantle. The Infant Jesus holds a cross in his left hand. The perfectionist rendering of details and textures, such as the capitals, the checquered pavement, the goldwork of the angel's crown or the garments is characteristic of Jan van Eyck's work, of which this is one of the finest examples.\n\nAs in other van Eycks, the depiction of the space is not as straightforward as it first appears. Comparison of the floor-tiles with other elements shows that the figures are only about six feet from the columned loggia screen, and that Rolin might have to squeeze himself through the opening to get out that way. Many van Eycks show an interior space that is actually very small, but the depiction is subtly managed to retain a sense of intimacy, but without feeling constricted.\n\nInfrared reflectograms have disclosed a number of changes from the underdrawing. Rolin had a large purse hanging from his belt; since he had grown very rich in public office he probably felt that would be inappropriate. The infant Christ was originally pointing at the floor. Old descriptions from Autun tell us that the painting originally had a wooden frame painted illusionistically with inscriptions seemingly carved, like van Eyck's two portraits in London (\"Léal Souvenir\" and \"Portrait of a Man in a Turban\").\n\nThe Virgin sits with the infant Christ \"on her knee\" (i.e. on her thighs), which make a platform for the infant. This very traditional motif is known as the \"Throne of Wisdom\", and was often used by Jan van Eyck, who elaborated the meaning in complex allusions. The Virgin's body was often compared to an altar, on which Christ was present as he was believed to be during the Mass. This painting may have originally hung to the left of Rolin's place at the front of his chapel in his parish church, between him and the altar. To Rolin, or a viewer of the real and painted Rolins together, the Virgin is painted in the position of the altar in the chapel. The illuminated manuscript in front of Rolin is open to a page with a large initial D, which probably indicates \"Domine, labia mea aperies\" (\"Lord, open my lips\"), the opening of Matins; this is therefore a Book of Hours. \n\nThe architecture of the loggia, as in so many of van Eyck's paintings, is in a rich and delicate Romanesque style far from the Gothic styles of his own day. The setting probably represents at the same time an imaginary building in Autun, and the \"Heavenly city of Jerusalem\"; two personages from two worlds are shown, and their surrounding combines the world of each.\n\nThe painting might be connected with the appointment in 1436 of Rolin's son Jean as Bishop of Autun; there is a magnificent cathedral on the Virgin's side of the river. Also, just above Rolin's hands there is a smaller church, perhaps intended to represent a new church dedicated to the Virgin, or his own parish church, \"Notre-Dame-du-Chastel\" which he greatly enriched.\n\nThere appears to be a series of illustrations of the Seven deadly sins distributed among the details of the painting. The reliefs just over Rolin's head show (from left) \"the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise\" (Pride), the \"Killing of Abel by Cain\" (Envy) and the \"Drunkenness of Noah\" (Gluttony). Then the lion-heads on the capitals behind Rolin may stand for Anger, and the tiny squashed rabbits between column and base in the loggia screen for Lust (which they were considered to exemplify in the Middle Ages). All these details are on Rolin's side of the painting; no equivalents are visible on the other, divine, side. However this leaves Avarice and Sloth unaccounted for, unless perhaps the human figures of Rolin himself (with his underdrawn purse), and the idlers out on the terrace (perhaps including, as stated above, van Eyck himself) represent the last two vices.\n\nNew theories about \"The Virgin and Child with Chancellor Rolin\" and Jan van Eyck's journey to Spain\n"}

{"id": "33042789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33042789", "title": "Multidisciplinary professional services networks", "text": "Multidisciplinary professional services networks\n\nMultidisciplinary professional services networks are organizations formed by law, accounting and other professional services firms to offer clients new multidisciplinary approaches solving increasingly complex issues. They are a type of professional services network which operates to provide services to their members. They operate in the same way as accounting firm networks and associations and law firm networks. They do not practice a profession such as law or accounting but provide services to members so they can serve clients needs.Aim is to provide members involved in doing business internationally with access to experienced, tried and tested, reliable, and responsive professional advisers who know their local jurisdiction intimately as well as the intricacies of cross border business.\n\nThere are 10 multidisciplinary networks. The largest are: Alliott Group, MSI Global Alliance, Morison International, Geneva Group, International Practice Group, WSG - World Services Group and Russell Bedford International. These networks have more than 100 member firms in as many as 90 countries in hundreds of offices. The members employ thousands of professionals.\n\nMultidisciplinary networks are not new but found in a number of professions. They became important during the end of the 1990s when the accounting firms began to expand to the legal profession. The history is well documented. \n\nThe American Bar Association Commission on Multidisciplinary Practice refers to five multidisciplinary models. They are the cooperative, command and control, ancillary practice, network and multidisciplinary partnership models.\n\nThe multidisciplinary issues first arose in the 1940s but was dealt with by the American Bar Association prohibiting lawyers working for accounting firms to represent clients before the IRS. The foundation of multidisciplinary practice began when the Big 4 accounting firms reached their natural growth limits. Accounting, auditing and tax services could generate only a finite amount of revenue for the Big 6. The Big 4’s concept was simple: use the extensive list of clients to market non-traditional accounting services such as legal, recruitment, risk management, technology consulting, etc. The objective was to bring these non-traditional services “in-house” using the time-tested network model. \n\nHaving reached their natural limit on growth the Big 4 branched out to become multidisciplinary in legal, technology, and employment services. Since the essential infrastructure was in place, it was thought to be relatively simple to incorporate other services into the existing network. The expansion could easily be financed using revenue from the traditional services. As a network, it was natural to create independent entities in these other professions which themselves could be part of the network. The method and structures varied from firm to firm but the fundamental premise was the sharing of revenue between lawyers and accountants.\n\nThe accounting firms were initially very successful in creating these alternative businesses. Soon a number of Big 6 firms had multi-billion dollar technology consulting businesses. Other services were more difficult to bring in-house. Some, like legal services, demanded a different approach because of ethical considerations. The key factor among such different approaches is an internal control system within a firm.\n\nThe initial to expand to legal services focus was on the United States which represented the largest potential market for these services. In Europe and South America the bar rules were not as developed as in the United States, and therefore did not restrict the sharing of revenues. The basis for this expansion was the law firm network that established under the umbrella of the Big Six. The issues were sharing profits with accountants and other professionals and the possible conflicts of interest.\n\nWhen the Big 6 began its expansion to the legal profession, it was met with fierce opposition from law firms and bar associations. Lawyers saw that the accounting profession would subsume the legal profession with its vast resources.\nCommissions, panels and committees were established by legal and accounting firms to argue their positions. The American Bar Association established committees and taskforces to address the issue, but the problem spread outside of the United States, first to Europe but then to other countries where lawyers were not protected from this new foreign competition. Government agencies were enlisted. For more than five (5) years the debate escalated. \n\nThis movement ended abruptly with the fall of Arthur Andersen as a result of its association with Enron. Sarbanes Oxley followed, which effectively ended this trend of multisdisciplinary networks established by the Big 5.\n\nThere was, however, a fatal flaw in the multidisciplinary network concepts of the Big 6. The raison d’etre of the Big 6 was to audit public companies. Each service which is provided to an audited client contained an inherent conflict of interest. This conflict was illustrated by the perfect storm created by Enron. The additional services that Arthur Anderson was offering created a conflict in their role as the auditor. Multidisciplinary networks by the accounting firms were DOA. The final nail in the coffin was Sarbanes Oxley which meant that the accounting firms had to divest their consulting practices.\n\nThe multidisciplinary network model was not dead but transformed to account for the issues. If the member firms were themselves independent, there was no prohibition on having a multidisciplinary network. This was recognized by the ABA.\n\nToday there are at least eleven networks. The largest are in the legal and accounting professions. A few of the legal and accounting networks include investment banking. The primary networks are focused on tax, employment, intellectual property, insurance and immigration.\n\n"}

The dog is indifferent to the painting, to the books and to the painting palette (which shows Hogarth's Line of Beauty). So the painting seems to be a Vanitas still life. But, as an ironic disruption, the cloth behind the dog comes out of the painting.\n\nThe painting is part of the collections of the Tate Gallery.\n"}
{"id": "2060392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2060392", "title": "Pair by association", "text": "Pair by association\n\nIn relation to psychology, pair by association is the action of associating a stimulus with an arbitrary idea or object, eliciting a response, usually emotional. This is done by repeatedly pairing the stimulus with the arbitrary object.\n\nFor example, repeatedly pairing images of beautiful women in bathing suits elicits a sexual response in most men. Advertising agencies repeatedly pair products with attractive women in television commercials with the intention of eliciting an emotional or sexually aroused response in the consumer. This causes the consumer to be more likely to buy the product than when presented with a similar product without such an association.\n\nThe hippocampal area, beyond its importance in episodic memory is in part responsible in the creation and storage of associations in the memory, especially for item associations. Furthermore, as stated by Gilbert & Kesner, the associations that are created are those that might be \"“critical”\" in paired-associative learning. Through studies on rats, it has been found that lesions to the hippocampus lead to object-place associative learning impairments. The findings of hippocampal damage that lead to impairments in the association between object-place as Gilbert & Kesner state have been seen in not only rodents but also non-human primates and humans . It should be noted that previously learned associations made before the damage to the hippocampal area were not affected with impairment. Gilbert & Kesner have suggested in their work that this ability to still recall previously stored associations may be due to modified synapses in an \"“auto associative network”\".\n\nPaired association learning can be defined as a system of learning in which items (such as words, letters, numbers, symbols etc.) are matched so that presentation of one member of the pair will cue the recall of the other member. It is this learning which constitutes the basics in a paired-associate task. These tasks can be divided into the following: visual-visual, verbal-verbal, and visual-verbal. In visual-visual both members of the pair are in a visual form (e.g. the picture of a blue circle paired with that of a picture of a yellow triangle). The verbal-verbal is when the members of the pair are both verbally presented (e.g. listening to the word cat followed by the word hat spoken to a participant). The last form, visual-verbal is when one member of the pair is spoken out loud while the other member is presented in a visual form (e.g. listening to the word box and seeing a picture of a house). It should be noted that visual associative learning has a positive association with age. In school age children, their visual association ability grows in conjunction with their age; younger children made more errors while older children made less.\nThe paired association task broken down to its basics is: a stimuli, response, and the consequence of the cue association. This is best seen in a study where Naya, Sakai, & Miyashita performed one version of the task on monkeys. In the study a primate was given a visual-visual paired-associate task where they were shown all the pairs in the set. Then after a long delay they displayed one picture of a pair to the primate. When the correct picture was paired by the monkey, showing that the pictures were cueing the response, they were given rewards in the form of food. What this study shows is that it is possible for associations to occur for two previously unrelated items. The monkeys showed they had actually remembered what was shown to them. In visual associative learning, the efficiency of the participant/subject in making these connections actually will decrease as the “memory load” increases. The more items/the higher the complexity that one has to keep in their memory leads to poorer performance on paired associative learning tasks.\nGluck, Mercado, and Myers explain how paired-association is possibly tied to encoding rather than retrieval. In the study presented by Gluck et al., there was a paired associates test where after studying word pairs the participants were presented with one word from the pair and required to recall the match there was a noticeable difference in accuracy between the young adult and older adults. At the start of the study each pair was shown for 15 seconds, in this the older adults had much worse performance; their recall abilities paled in comparison to the younger adults. This however did change when the time was doubled to that of 30 seconds; here the elderly were able to have a much improved performance level. It is an accepted understanding that in associative learning there is a negative regression, as one ages their performance levels decrease. The regression remains even after addressing the possible interfering variables such as attention or spatial memory.\n\nWhen the paired association task is performed, there are ways in which the performance in the task can be either negatively or positively affected. Associations suffer when an item is shared between associations; double function pairs such as AB and BC will be harder to recall later than control pairs such as AB and CD. As Caplan et al., state double function pairs create what is called association ambiguity, a sharing of a common member in the pair, which leads to interference. The brain has difficulty in processing the pairs to the point that in some cases one pair will be remembered at the expense of the other pair. An example is in the two word pairs CAR-HORN and CAR-DOG. In this word pair a participant would remember 1 pair primarily while forgetting the other pair. Memory for ambiguous pairs will often suffer compared to unambiguous pairs in both situations of e.g. AB and BC or AB and AC. One matter that is not affected is a cue recall in either direction, forward (cue A, recall B) or backward (cue B, recall A); either direction will not affect the accuracy of the recall. This also holds true for double function pairs.\nAdditionally, there is ongoing research into the effects ecstasy/polystimulant use has on paired-associate task/learning. In a study by Gallagher et al., it was found that those who used ecstasy/polydrugs had in general more false positive responses, clicking yes (in agreement) when asked if a word pair had been previously presented even if the reality was false, compared to non-users. It was proposed that because creating the association between word pairs requires executive resources, which has been known to be hampered in ecstasy users. This is what has prevented the binding of word pairs. However, as stated by the author, it is not possible to fully attribute these deficits in the task, but it bears noting that there are differences occurring.\nAn association can be improved with the aid of the production effect which is a finding where speaking a word out loud leads to enhancements in memory compared to reading a word silently. The production effect is not limited to speaking a word aloud; mouthing, writing, whispering, spelling, and typing all lead to an enhanced memory though the level will not be the same as reading aloud. In accordance with Putnam et al., the enhancement in recall in the production effect is because reading aloud creates a more distinctive memory in the encoding process. Moreover, the production effect improved not only pair recognition but also paired-associate recall. These findings hint at a positive link between the production effect and the association between pairs in relation to paired-associate task/learning; using one of the elements in the production effect leads to improved encoding of associations.\n\nBehaviorists will often use paired association tests to determine the strength of verbal behavior, in particular, B.F Skinner's concept of the verbal response class called intraverbals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1438343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1438343", "title": "Parataxis", "text": "Parataxis\n\nParataxis (from Greek παράταξις \"act of placing side by side\", from παρα \"para\" \"beside\" + τάξις \"táxis\" \"arrangement\") is a literary technique, in writing or speaking, that favors short, simple sentences, with the use of coordinating rather than subordinating conjunctions. It contrasts with syntaxis and hypotaxis.\n\nIt is also used to describe a technique in poetry in which two images or fragments, usually starkly dissimilar images or fragments, are juxtaposed without a clear connection. Readers are then left to make their own connections implied by the paratactic syntax. Ezra Pound, in his adaptation of Chinese and Japanese poetry, made the stark juxtaposition of images an important part of English-language poetry.\n\nEdward Parmelee Morris wrote in 1901 that the term was introduced into linguistics by Friedrich Thiersch in his \"Greek Grammar\" (1831). The concept has expanded since then, and a number of definitions have emerged, often conflicting.\n\nParataxis may be considered from three points of view:\n\n\nThe underlying idea is that in a connected discourse, complete independence among the consecutive sentences is very rare. This observation is captured in the expression \"train of thought\". Consider the following:\n\n\nIn the first example, the two sentences are independent expressions, while in the last example they are dependent. However, the connection of thought in the first examples is just as real as in the last ones, where it is explicitly expressed via the syntax of subordination.\n\nIn spoken language, this continuance from sentence to sentence is supported by intonation and timing (rhythm, pause). While details may differ among different languages and cultures, generally similar musicality and shortness of pauses indicate the continuation, while the change of tone and longer pause generally indicate the transition to\nanother connected group of ideas.\n\nPerhaps the best known use of parataxis is Julius Caesar's famous laconic phrase, \"Veni, vidi, vici\" or, \"I came, I saw, I conquered\". Another example is Mr. Jingle's speech in Chapter 2 of \"The Pickwick Papers\" by Charles Dickens.\n\n\"Come along, then,\" said he of the green coat, lugging Mr. Pickwick after him by main force, and talking the whole way. \"Here, No. 924, take your fare, and take yourself off—respectable\ngentleman—know him well—none of your nonsense—this way, sir—where's your friends?—all a mistake, I see—never mind—accidents will happen—best regulated families—never say die—down upon your luck—Pull him UP—Put that in his pipe—like the flavour—damned rascals.\" And with a lengthened string of similar broken sentences, delivered with extraordinary volubility, the stranger led the way to the traveller's waiting-room, whither he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick and his disciples.\n\nPerhaps a more extreme proponent of the form was Samuel Beckett. The opening to his monologue \"Not I\" is a classic example:\n\nMouth: out ... into this world ... this world ... tiny little thing ... before its time ... in a godfor– ... what? girl? yes ... tiny little girl ... into this ... out into this ... before her time ... godforsaken hole called ... called ... no matter ... parents unknown ... unheard of ... he having vanished ... thin air ... no sooner buttoned up his breeches ... she similarly ... eight months later ... almost to the tick ... so no love ... spared that ... no love such as normally vented on the ... speechless infant ... in the home ... no ... nor indeed for that matter any of any kind ... no love of any kind ... at any subsequent stage ...\n\nAlthough the use of ellipses here arguably prevents it from being seen as a classic example of parataxis, as a spoken text it operates in precisely that way. Other examples by Beckett would include large chunks of Lucky's famous speech in \"Waiting for Godot\".\n\nParataxis is occasionally found in spontaneous utterances. An example might be the last words of a serial killer named Aileen Wuornos who killed seven men in Florida between 1989 and 1990. She was executed on October 9, 2002 and her last words were: \"Yes, I would just like to say I’m sailing with the rock, and I’ll be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus. June 6, like the movie. Big mother ship and all, I’ll be back, I’ll be back.\"\n\nIn What Is Called Thinking?, Martin Heidegger addresses the paratactic nature of Classical Greek texts. Through analyzing a fragment from Parmenides (typically translated \"One should both say and think that Being is\") Heidegger argues that modern syntactic translations of paratactic Greek texts often leave the meaning obscured. He suggests multiple translations of the fragment that may more closely resemble the paratactic Greek original. These include \"needful : the saying also thinking too : being : to be,\" and \"Useful is the letting lie before us, the taking-to-heart, too: beings in Being.\" Heidegger points to a modern linguistic bias that places paratactic language beneath syntactic language; paratactic language is often viewed as \"child-like\" or \"primitive.\" He argues that a paratactic sentence a child might say, such as \"dog, woof-woof, bad\" is not inherently less meaningful than its syntactic equivalent, like \"dogs bark and can be dangerous.\"\n\nThe term \"parataxis\" has also been appropriated by some cultural theorists to describe certain works of art or \"cultural texts\" in which a series of scenes or elements are presented side by side in no particular order or hierarchy. Examples might range from the collages of the dadaists and Robert Rauschenberg to many contemporary music videos. The traditional polyptych constitutes another example.\n"}
{"id": "5127168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5127168", "title": "Prostitution in the United States", "text": "Prostitution in the United States\n\nProstitution is illegal in the vast majority of the United States as a result of state laws rather than federal laws. It is, however, legal in some rural counties within the state of Nevada. Prostitution nevertheless occurs throughout the country.\n\nThe regulation of prostitution in the country is not among the enumerated powers of the federal government. It is therefore exclusively the domain of the states to permit, prohibit, or otherwise regulate commercial sex under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, except insofar as Congress may regulate it as part of interstate commerce with laws like the Mann Act. In most states, prostitution is considered a misdemeanor in the category of public order crime–crime that disrupts the order of a community. Prostitution was at one time considered a vagrancy crime.\n\nCurrently, Nevada is the only U.S. jurisdiction to allow legal prostitution – in the form of regulated brothels – the terms of which are stipulated in the \"Nevada Revised Statutes\". Only eight counties currently contain active brothels. All forms of prostitution are illegal in Clark County (which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area), Washoe County (which contains Reno), Carson City, Douglas County, and Lincoln County. The other counties theoretically allow brothel prostitution, but some of these counties currently have no active brothels. Street prostitution, \"pandering\", and living off of the proceeds of a prostitute remain illegal under Nevada law, as is the case elsewhere in the country.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Justice, a study conducted in 2008 found that approximately 15-20 percent of men in the country have engaged in commercial sex.\n\nAs with other countries, prostitution in the U.S. can be divided into three broad categories: street prostitution, brothel prostitution, and escort prostitution.\n\nSome of the women in the American Revolution who followed the Continental Army served the soldiers and officers as sexual partners. Prostitutes were a worrisome presence to army leadership, particularly because of the possible spread of venereal diseases. \n\nIn the 19th century, parlor house brothels catered to upper class clientele, while bawdy houses catered to the lower class. At concert saloons, men could eat, listen to music, watch a fight, or pay women for sex. Over 200 brothels existed in lower Manhattan. Prostitution was illegal under the vagrancy laws, but was not well-enforced by police and city officials, who were bribed by brothel owners and madams. Attempts to regulate prostitution were struck down on the grounds that regulation would be counter to the public good. Seventy-five percent of New York men had some type of sexually transmitted disease.\nThe gold rush profits of the 1840s to 1900 attracted gambling, crime, saloons, and prostitution to the mining towns of the wild west. A brothel-keeper, Julia Bulette, who was active in the mining town of Virginia City, Nevada, was murdered in 1867. Thirty years before, in 1836, the New York City courtesan Helen Jewett was murdered, by one of her customers gaining prostitution considerable attention. The Lorette Ordinance of 1857 prohibited prostitution on the first floor of buildings in New Orleans. Nevertheless, prostitution continued to grow rapidly in the U.S., becoming a $6.3 million business in 1858, more than the shipping and brewing industries combined.\n\nSome army officers, however, encouraged the presence of prostitutes during the Civil War to keep troop morale high. In August 20, 1863, the U.S. military commander Brig. General Robert S. Granger legalized prostitution in Nashville, Tennessee, in order to curb venereal disease among Union soldiers. The move was successful and venereal disease rates fell from forty percent to just four percent due to a stringent program of health checks which required all prostitutes to register and be examined by a board certified physician every two weeks for which they were charged five dollars registration fee plus 50 cents each time. \n\nBy the U.S. Civil War, Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue had become a disreputable slum known as Murder Bay, home to an extensive criminal underclass and numerous brothels. So many prostitutes took up residence there to serve the needs of General Joseph Hooker's Army of the Potomac that the area became known as \"Hooker's Division.\" (It is from this period that the slang term \"hooker\" originates.) Two blocks between Pennsylvania and Missouri Avenues became home to such expensive brothels that it was known as \"Marble Alley.\"\n\nIn 1873, Anthony Comstock created the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, an institution dedicated to supervising the morality of the public. Comstock successfully influenced the United States Congress to pass the Comstock Law, which made illegal the delivery or transport of \"obscene, lewd, or lascivious\" material and birth control information. In 1875, Congress passed the Page Act of 1875 that made it illegal to transport women into the nation to be used as prostitutes.\n\nIn 1881, the Bird Cage Theatre opened in Tombstone, Arizona. It included a brothel in the basement and 14 cribs suspended from the ceiling, called cages. Local men such as Doc Holliday, Bat Masterson, Diamond Jim Brady, and George Hearst frequented the establishment.\n\nIn the late 19th century, newspapers reported that 65,000 white slaves existed. Around 1890, the term \"red-light district\" was first recorded in the United States. From 1890 to 1982, the Dumas Brothel in Montana was America's longest-running house of prostitution.\n\nNew Orleans city alderman Sidney Story wrote an ordinance in 1897 to regulate and limit prostitution to one small area of the city, \"The District\", where all prostitutes in New Orleans must live and work. The District, which was nicknamed Storyville, became the best known area for prostitution in the nation. Storyville at its peak had some 1,500 prostitutes and 200 brothels.\n\nIn 1908, the Bureau of Investigation (BOI, from 1935, the FBI)) was founded by the government to investigate \"white slavery\" by interviewing brothel employees to discover if they had been kidnapped. Out of 1,106 prostitutes interviewed in one city, six said they were victims of white slavery. The White-Slave Traffic Act (Mann Act) of 1910 prohibited so-called white slavery. It also banned the interstate transportation of women for \"immoral purposes\". Its primary stated intent was to address prostitution and perceived immorality. The Supreme Court later included consensual debauchery, adultery, and polygamy under \"immoral purposes\". Prior to World War I, there were few laws criminalizing prostitutes or the act of prostitution.\nDuring World War I, the U.S. government developed a public health program called the \"American Plan\" which authorized the military to arrest any woman within five miles of a military cantonment. If found infected, a woman could be sentenced to a hospital or a \"farm colony\" until cured. By the end of the war 15,520 prostitutes had been imprisoned, the majority never being medically hospitalized.\n\nIn 1918, the Chamberlain-Kahn Act which implemented the American Plan, gave the government the power to quarantine any woman suspected of having venereal disease (in modern terms, Sexually transmitted infection or STI). A medical examination was required, and if it revealed to be VD, this discovery could constitute proof of prostitution. The purpose of this law was to prevent the spread of venereal diseases among U.S. soldiers. During World War I, Storyville, a district in New Orleans where prostitution was permitted, was shut down to prevent VD transmission to soldiers in nearby army and navy camps.\n\nOn January 25, 1917, an anti-prostitution drive in San Francisco attracted huge crowds to public meetings. At one meeting attended by 7,000 people, 20,000 were kept out for lack of room. In a conference with Reverend Paul Smith, an outspoken foe of prostitution, 300 prostitutes made a plea for toleration, explaining they had been forced into the practice by poverty. When Smith asked if they would take other work at $8 to $10 a week, the ladies laughed derisively, which lost them public sympathy. The police closed about 200 houses of prostitution shortly thereafter.\n\nThe National Venereal Disease Control Act, which became effective July 1, 1938, authorized the appropriation of federal funds to assist the states in combating venereal diseases. Appropriations under this act were doubled after the United States entered the war. The May Act,3 which became effective with its signature by the President, July 11, 1941, armed the federal government with authority to suppress commercialized vice in the neighborhood of military camps and naval establishments in the United States.\n\nThe May Act, which became law in June 1941, intended to prevent prostitution on restricted zones around military bases. It was invoked chiefly during wartime. See World War II U.S. Military Sex Education.\n\n\"Mortensen vs. United States\", in 1944, ruled that prostitutes could travel across state lines, if the purpose of travel was not for prostitution.\n\nConditions for sex trade workers changed considerably in the 1960s. The combined oral contraceptive pill was first approved in 1960 for contraceptive use in the United States. \"The Pill\" helped prostitutes prevent pregnancy.\n\nIn 1967, New York City eliminated license requirements for massage parlors. Many massage parlors became brothels. In 1970, Nevada began regulation of houses of prostitution. In 1971, the Mustang Ranch became Nevada's first licensed brothel, eventually leading to the legalization of brothel prostitution in 10 of 17 counties within the state. In time, Mustang Ranch became Nevada's largest brothel, with more revenue than all other legal Nevada brothels combined. By World War II, prostitutes had increasingly gone underground as call girls.\nIn 1971, the New York madame Xaviera Hollander wrote \"The Happy Hooker: My Own Story\", a book that was notable for its frankness at the time, and considered a landmark of positive writing about sex. An early forerunner (1920s-1930s) of Xaviera Hollander's, both as a madam and author, was Polly Adler, whose bestselling book, \"A House Is Not a Home\", was eventually adapted as a film also entitled \"A House is Not a Home\". Carol Leigh, a prostitute's rights activist known as the \"Scarlot Harlot,\" coined the term \"Sex worker\" in 1978. That same year, the Broadway musical \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\" opened. It was based on the real-life Texas Chicken Ranch brothel. The play was the basis for the 1982 film starring Dolly Parton and Burt Reynolds.\n\nCOYOTE, formed in 1973, was the first prostitutes' rights group in the country. Other prostitutes' rights groups later formed, such as FLOP, HIRE, and PUMA.\n\nIn 1997, \"Hollywood Madam\" Heidi Fleiss was convicted in connection with her prostitution ring with charges including pandering and tax evasion. Her ring had numerous wealthy clients. Her original three-year sentence prompted widespread outrage at her harsh punishment, while her customers had not been punished. Earlier, in the 1980s, a member of Philadelphia's social elite, Sydney Biddle Barrows was revealed as a madam in New York City. She became known as the Mayflower Madam.\n\nIn 1990, U.S. Representative Barney Frank (D-MA) admitted to paying for sex in 1989. The House of Representatives voted to reprimand him.\n\nTed Haggard, former leader of the National Association of Evangelicals, resigned in 2006 after he was accused of soliciting homosexual sex and methamphetamine.\n\nRandall L. Tobias, former Director of U.S. Foreign Assistance and U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator, resigned in 2007 after being accused of patronizing a Washington escort service.\n\nIn 2007, U.S. Senator from Louisiana David Vitter acknowledged past transgressions after his name was listed as a client of \"D.C. Madam\" Deborah Jeane Palfrey's prostitution service in Washington.\n\nEliot Spitzer resigned as governor of New York in 2008 amid threats of impeachment after news reports alleged he was a client of an international prostitution ring.\n\nIn 2009, Rhode Island signed a bill into law making prostitution a misdemeanor. Prior to this law, between 1980 and 2009, Rhode Island was the only U.S. state where prostitution was decriminalized, as long as it was done indoors. (See Prostitution in Rhode Island).\n\nIn 2014, due to the stagnant economy in Puerto Rico, the government considered legalizing prostitution. In 2018, economist Robin Hanson suggested that the legalization of prostitution may solve the problem of inceldom.\n\nOn April 11, 2018, the United States Congress passed the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, commonly known as FOSTA-SESTA, which imposed severe penalties on online platforms that facilitated illicit sex work. The act shut down Backpage and lead to the arrest of its founders. The effectiveness of the bill has come into question as it has purportedly endangered sex workers and has been ineffective in catching and stopping sex traffickers.\n\nAlthough informal, red light districts can be found in some areas of the country, such as The Block in Baltimore. Since prostitution is illegal, there are no formal brothels, but massage parlors offering prostitution may be found along with street prostitution. Typically, these areas will also have other adult-oriented businesses, often due to zoning, such as strip clubs, sex shops, adult movie theaters, adult video arcades, peep shows, sex shows, and sex clubs.\n\nStreet prostitution is illegal throughout the United States. Street prostitution tends to be clustered in certain areas known for solicitation. For instance, statistics on official arrests from the Chicago Police Department from August 19, 2005 to May 1, 2007, suggest that prostitution activity is highly concentrated: nearly half of all prostitution arrests occur in a tiny one-third of one percent of all blocks in the entire city of Chicago.\n\nA study of violence against women engaged in street prostitution found that 68% reported having been raped and 82% reported having been physically assaulted.\n\nA variation of street prostitution is that which occurs at truck stops along Interstate highways in rural areas. Called \"lot lizards\", these prostitutes solicit at truck stop parking lots and may use CB radios to communicate.\n\nIn todays society there is a hierarchy amongst prostitutes and an even greater distinction between indoor workers and outdoor workers. The indoor prostitutes occupy the top tier to include independent call girls, and workers in brothels and massage parlors. The outdoor street walkers occupy the lowest level and are more likely to experience abuse.\nTwo hundred and forty prostitutes, one hundred and fifteen outdoor and one hundred twenty-five indoor, were interviewed for a study about victimization. Weitzer, R (2005) noted that indoor workers (iw) experienced less harm compared to outdoor workers (ow): \n• Robbed- (ow) 37% - (iw) 10%\n• Beaten- (ow) 27% - (iw) 1%\n• Slapped, punched, kicked- (ow) 47% - 14%\n• Raped- (ow) 22% - (iw) 2%\n• Kidnapped- (ow) 20% - (iw) 2%\nThe outdoor prostitutes or streetwalkers are the most recognized sex worker’s, but they make up a very small number of workers. Cunningham & Kendall (2011) report that only 20% of prostitutes work on the streets. The indoor workers have more freedom to choose their clients and set boundaries that contribute to their safety. The above numbers contribute to the arguments against prostitution, which clearly affect one type of sex worker. \n\nIn spite of its illegality, escort prostitution exists throughout the United States from both independent prostitutes and those employed through escort agencies. Both freelancers and agencies may advertise under the term \"bodywork\" in the back of alternative newspapers, although some of these bodywork professionals are straightforward massage professionals.\n\nThe amount of money made by an escort differs depending on race, appearance, age, experience (e.g., pornography and magazine work), gender, services rendered, and location. Generally, male escorts command less on an hourly basis than women; white women quote higher rates than non-white women; and youth is at a premium. In the gay community, one escort agency in Washington, D.C., charges $150 an hour for male escorts and $250 an hour for transgender escorts. That agency takes $50 an hour from the escort. In larger metropolitan areas such as New York City, extremely attractive white American female escorts can charge $1,000–$2,000 per hour, with the agency taking 40%-50%.\n\nTypically, an agency will charge its escorts either a flat fee for each client connection or a percentage of the prearranged rate. In San Francisco, it is usual for typical heterosexual-market agencies to negotiate for as little as $100 up to a full 50% of a woman's reported earnings (not counting any gratuity received). Most transactions occur in cash, and optional tipping of escorts by clients in most major U.S. cities is customary but not compulsory. Credit card processing offered by larger scale agencies is often available for a service charge.\n\nEscorts and escort agencies have historically advertised through classified ads, yellow pages advertising, or word-of-mouth, but in more recent years, much of the advertising and soliciting of indoor prostitution has shifted to internet sites. Sites may represent individual escorts, agencies, or may run ads for many escorts. There are also a number of sites in which customers can discuss and post reviews of the sexual services offered by prostitutes and other sex workers. Many sites allow potential buyers to search for sex workers by physical characteristics and types of services offered.\n\nInternet advertising of sexual services is offered not only by specialty sites, but in many cases by more mainstream advertising sites. Craigslist for many years featured an \"adult services\" section of this kind. After several years of pressure from law enforcement and anti-prostitution groups, Craigslist closed this section in September 2010, first for its U.S. pages, then some months later internationally. In January 2017, the \"Adult\" section of Backpage was closed down.\n\nWith the exception of some rural counties of Nevada, brothels are illegal in the United States. However, many massage parlors, saunas, spas, and similar otherwise-legal establishments serve as fronts for prostitution, especially in larger cities. Often, parlors are staffed by Asian immigrants and advertise in alternative newspapers and on sites like Craigslist and Backpage. They tend to have much longer working hours than parlors which are not actually brothels. They tend to be located in cities or along major highways.\n\nThe prostitution of children in the United States is a serious concern More than 100,000 children are reportedly forced into prostitution in the United States every year.\n\nNevada is the only U.S. jurisdiction to allow some legal prostitution. Currently eight counties in Nevada have active brothels (these are all rural counties); as of February 2018, there are 21 brothels in Nevada. Prostitution outside the licensed brothels is illegal throughout Nevada. Prostitution is illegal in the major metropolitan areas of Las Vegas, Reno, and Carson City, where most of the population lives; more than 90% of Nevada citizens live in a county where prostitution is illegal.\n\nProstitution in Rhode Island was outlawed in 2009. On November 3, governor Donald Carcieri signed into law a bill which makes the buying and selling of sexual services a crime.\nProstitution was legal in Rhode Island between 1980 and 2009 because there was no specific statute to define the act and outlaw it, although associated activities such as street solicitation, running a brothel and pimping were illegal.\n\nLouisiana is the only state where convicted prostitutes are required to register as sex offenders. The State's crime against nature by solicitation law is used when a person is accused of engaging in oral or anal sex in exchange for money. Only prostitutes prosecuted under this law are required to be registered. This has led to a lawsuit filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights.\n\nThe federal government also prosecutes some prostitution offenses. One man who forced women to be prostitutes received a 40-year sentence in federal court. Another was prosecuted for income tax evasion. Another man pleaded guilty to federal charges of harboring a 15-year-old girl and having her work as a prostitute. Another federal defendant got life imprisonment for sex trafficking of a child by force.\n\nThe ban on prostitution in the US has been criticized from a variety of viewpoints.\n\nOne 1990 study estimated the annual prevalence of full-time equivalent prostitutes in the United States to be 23 per 100,000 population based on a capture–recapture study of prostitutes found in Colorado Springs, CO, police and sexually transmitted diseases clinic records between 1970 and 1988.\n\nA continuation of the Colorado Springs study found a death rate among active prostitutes of 459 per 100,000 person-years, which is 5.9 times that for the (age and race adjusted) general population.\n\nAmong voluntary substance abuse program participants, 41.4% of women and 11.2% of men reported selling prostitution services during the last year (March 2008).\n\nIn Newark, New Jersey, one report claims 57 percent of prostitutes are reportedly HIV-positive, and in Atlanta, 12 percent of prostitutes are possibly HIV-positive.\n\nA 2004 TNS poll reported 15 percent of all men have paid for sex and 30 percent of single men over age 30 have paid for sex.\n\nOver 200 men answered ads placed in Chicago area sex service classifieds for in depth interviews. Of these self-admitted \"johns\", 83% view buying sex as a form of addiction, 57% suspect that the women they paid were abused as children, and 40% said they are usually intoxicated when they purchase sex.\n\nThe prostitution trade in the United States is estimated to generate $14 billion a year. A 2012 report by \"Fondation Scelles\" indicated that there were an estimated 1 million prostitutes in the U.S.\n\nJohn schools are programs whose mission is the rehabilitation of purchasers of prostitution. In the first 12 years of the ongoing program, now denominated the \"First Offender Prostitution Program\", the recidivism rate of offenders was reduced from 8% to less than 5%. Since 1995, similar programs have been implemented in more than 40 communities in the US, including Washington, DC; West Palm Beach, Florida; Buffalo and Brooklyn, New York; and Los Angeles, California. An audit in 2009 of the first john school in San Francisco, California by the budget analysts of the City faulted the program with poorly defined objectives and absence of a method to determine its efficacy. Despite being touted as a national model for which taxpayers pay nothing, the audit stated that the program did not fully cover its expenses in each of the preceding 5 years, which resulted in a deficit of $270,000.\n\n\n"}

His writings, consultations, and research have been instrumental in understanding developmental stages in Black males, public policy and its connection to compensatory justice, relationships between Black males and females, infusion of African studies into school curricula, and the impact of hip hop culture on the contemporary American landscape. He is currently Research Professor and Director of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nEarly life\n\nWinbush is one of five children and the middle of three sons born to Harold Winbush, a Clevlend,Ohio steel worker, and Dorothy Winbush, a housewife. A depressed economy, low wages, and racial discrimination produced financial hardships for the family and in 1948 (the year of Winbush's birth), the family left Pittsburgh and moved to the east side of Cleveland, Ohio to begin anew. At the request of his elementary school art teacher, Winbush was tested and scored high on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test. Life changed for Winbush when he was bussed from his poor, Hough Avenue neighborhood to an accelerated school in a middle-class and predominantly Jewish neighborhood seven miles from his family's home. At twelve years old, Winbush realized differences between his educational experiences and those of his brothers. Much of Winbush's early childhood narrative is detailed in his first book, \"The Warrior Method\".\n\nEducation\n\nAfter graduating from Cleveland's John Adams High School in 1966, Winbush entered Oakwood College (now Oakwood University) in Huntsville, Alabama where he won consecutive Ford Foundation Intensive Summer Studies Program scholarships to Harvard and Yale universities in 1968 and 1969 respectively. In 1970, Winbush graduated with honors and received his BA in psychology from Oakwood and later served the college as professor and chair of Behavioral Sciences from 1973 until 1977. Winbush earned his MA (1973) and PhD (1976) in clinical psychology from the University of Chicago. His thesis, \"A Quantitative Exploration into Proxemic Behavior,\" was a study of the cross-cultural differences of spacing behavior in public. His dissertation, \"A Quantitative Exploration into the Theoretical Formulations of Erik H. Erikson Concerning Black Identity,\" examined Erikson's fifth \"Age of Man\" and empirically refuted Erikson's ideas concerning identity development in young Blacks.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter serving as chair and Assistant Professor of Behavioral Sciences at Oakwood University and as Associate Professor of psychology at Alabama A&M University from 1973 to 1980, Winbush was named Assistant Provost and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Psychology at Vanderbilt University in 1980. From June 1986 until July 1989, he served as the first Director of the Joseph Johnson Black Cultural Center at Vanderbilt and was instrumental in examining enrollment and retention of African-American and other students of color at the university. Between 1975 and 2001, Winbush's research established numerous projects to raise awareness of America's race relations and their impact upon the lives of Black people. He received grants to further his work from the National Science Foundation, the Cleveland Foundation, Job Training Partnership Act of 1982, West African Research Association, Pitney Bowes, Inc., the Ford Motor Company, and the Kellogg Foundation. From 1995 until 2002, Winbush was the Benjamin Hooks Professor of Social Sciences and director of the Race Relations Institute at Fisk University in Nashville, TN. Since 2002, he has been Research Professor and Director of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland and in that same year aided in establishing the Global Afrikan Congress, the largest pan-African organization in the world.\n\nWinbush's consultations, research, and speaking engagements have gained him worldwide visibility. In addition to his diversity workshops, discussions on reparations, and keynote addresses on race relations for Princeton University, Yale University, Harvard University, Washington College of Law at American University, the Boeing Corporation, Columbia University Law School, New York University and others, Winbush has lectured on racism in a global context at Murdoch University in Perth, Western Australia, Amsterdam, Netherlands, and at the University of London School of Education. By 2000, he had helped organize the first international conference of the National Council for Black Studies in Ghana.\n\nWinbush appeared as race relations expert on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in 2005. His books, \"The Warrior Method: A Program for Rearing Healthy Black Boys\" and \"Should America Pay? Slavery and The Raging Debate on Reparations\" were published in 2001 and 2003 respectively. His latest book, \" Belinda's Petition: A Concise History of Reparations For The Transatlantic Slave Trade\" (XLibris, 2009), is considered a \"prequel\" to \"Should America Pay?: Slavery and the Raging Debate on Reparations\", and provides an overview of how reparations for the TransAtlantic Slave Trade has been a consistent theme among African people for the past 500 years.\n"}
{"id": "505826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505826", "title": "Robert Caro", "text": "Robert Caro\n\nRobert Allan Caro (born October 30, 1935) is an American journalist and author known for his biographies of United States political figures Robert Moses and Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nAfter working for many years as a reporter, Caro wrote \"The Power Broker\" (1974), a biography of New York urban planner Robert Moses, which was chosen by the Modern Library as one of the hundred greatest nonfiction books of the twentieth century. He has since written four of a planned five volumes of \"The Years of Lyndon Johnson\" (1982, 1990, 2002, 2012), a biography of the former president.\n\nFor his biographies, he has won two Pulitzer Prizes in Biography, two National Book Awards (including one for Lifetime Achievement), the Francis Parkman Prize (awarded by the Society of American Historians to the book that \"best exemplifies the union of the historian and the artist\"), three National Book Critics Circle Awards, the H.L. Mencken Award, the Carr P. Collins Award from the Texas Institute of Letters, the D.B. Hardeman Prize, and a Gold Medal in Biography from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2010 President Barack Obama awarded Caro the National Humanities Medal.\n\nDue to Caro's reputation for exhaustive research and detail, he is sometimes invoked by reviewers of other writers who are called \"Caro-esque\" for their own extensive research.\n\nCaro was born in New York City, the son of Cele (née Mendelow) and Benjamin Caro. He grew up on Central Park West at 94th Street. His father, a businessman, spoke Yiddish as well as English, but he didn't speak either very often. He was 'very silent,' Caro said, and became more so after Caro's mother died, after a long illness, when he [Caro] was 12. It was his mother's deathbed wish that he should go to the Horace Mann School, an exclusive private school in the Riverdale section of The Bronx. As a student there, Caro translated an edition of his school newspaper into Russian and mailed 10,000 copies to students in the USSR. He graduated in 1953. He went on to Princeton University, where he majored in English. He became managing editor of \"The Daily Princetonian\", second to R.W. Apple, Jr., later a prominent editor at \"The New York Times\".\n\nHis writings, both in class and out, had been lengthy since his years at Horace Mann. A short story he wrote for \"The Princeton Tiger\", the school's humor magazine, took up almost an entire issue. His senior thesis on existentialism in Hemingway was so long, Caro claims, that the university's English department subsequently established a maximum length for senior theses by its students. He graduated \"cum laude\" in 1957.\n\nAccording to a 2012 \"The New York Times Magazine\" profile, \"Caro said he now thinks that Princeton, which he chose because of its parties, was one of his mistakes, and that he should have gone to Harvard. Princeton in the mid-1950s was hardly known for being hospitable towards the Jewish community, and though Caro says he did not personally suffer from anti-Semitism, he saw plenty of students who did.\" He had a sports column in the \"Princetonian\" and also wrote for the \"Princeton Tiger\" humor magazine.\n\nCaro began his professional career as a reporter with the \"New Brunswick Daily Home News\" (now merged into the \"Home News Tribune\") in New Jersey. He took a brief leave to work for the Middlesex County Democratic Party as a publicist. He left politics after an incident where he was accompanying the party chair to polling places on election day. A police officer reported to the party chair that some African-Americans Caro saw being loaded into a police van, under arrest, were poll watchers who \"had been giving them some trouble.\" Caro left politics right there. \"I still think about it,\" he recalled in the 2012 \"Times Magazine\" profile. \"It wasn't the roughness of the police that made such an impression. It was the—meekness isn't the right word—the acceptance of those people of what was happening.\"\n\nAfter briefly enrolling in the English doctoral program at Rutgers University (where he served as a teaching assistant), he went on to six years as an investigative reporter with the Long Island newspaper \"Newsday\". One of the articles he wrote was a long series about why a proposed bridge across Long Island Sound from Rye to Oyster Bay, championed by Robert Moses, would have been inadvisable, requiring piers so large it would disrupt tidal flows in the sound, among other problems. Caro believed that his work had influenced even the state's powerful governor Nelson Rockefeller to reconsider the idea, until he saw the state's Assembly vote overwhelmingly to pass a preliminary measure for the bridge.\n\n\"That was one of the transformational moments of my life,\" Caro said years later. It led him to think about Moses for the first time. \"I got in the car and drove home to Long Island, and I kept thinking to myself: 'Everything you've been doing is baloney. You've been writing under the belief that power in a democracy comes from the ballot box. But here's a guy who has never been elected to anything, who has enough power to turn the entire state around, and you don't have the slightest idea how he got it.'\"\n\nCaro gave a speech to introduce Senator Ted Kennedy at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.\n\nCaro spent the academic year of 1965–1966 as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University. During a class on urban planning and land use, the experience of watching Moses returned to him.\n\nTo do so, Caro began work on a biography of Moses, \"The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York\", also a study of Caro's favorite theme: the acquisition and use of power. He expected it would take nine months to complete, but instead it took him until 1974. The work was based on extensive research and 522 interviews, including seven interviews with Moses himself, several with Michael Madigan (who worked for Moses for 35 years); and numerous interviews with Sidney Shapiro (Moses's general manager for forty years); as well as interviews with men who worked for and knew Moses's mentor, New York Governor Al Smith. During the 1967-1968 academic year, Caro worked on the book as a Carnegie Fellow at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.\n\nHis wife, Ina, functioned as his research assistant. Her master's thesis on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge stemmed from this work. At one point she sold the family home and took a teaching job so Robert would be financially able to finish the book.\n\n\"The Power Broker\" is widely viewed as a seminal work because it combined painstaking historical research with a smoothly flowing narrative writing style. The success of this approach was evident in his chapter on the construction of the Cross-Bronx Expressway, where Caro reported the controversy from all perspectives, including that of neighborhood residents. The result was a work of powerful literary as well as academic interest. Upon its publication, Moses denounced the biography in a 23-page statement.\n\nFollowing \"The Power Broker\", Caro turned his attention to President Lyndon B. Johnson. Caro retraced Johnson's life by temporarily moving to rural Texas and Washington, D.C., in order to better understand Johnson's upbringing and to interview anyone who had known Johnson. The work, entitled \"The Years of Lyndon Johnson\", was originally intended as a trilogy, but is projected to encompass five volumes:\n\n\nCaro's books portray Johnson as a complex and contradictory character: at the same time a scheming opportunist and visionary progressive. Caro argues, for example, that Johnson's victory in the 1948 runoff for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate was only achieved through extensive fraud and ballot box stuffing, though this is set in the practices of the time and in the context of Johnson's previous defeat in his 1941 race for the Senate, the victim of exactly similar chicanery. Caro also highlighted some of Johnson's campaign contributions, such as those from the Texas construction firm Brown and Root; in 1962 the company was acquired by another Texas firm, Halliburton, which became a major contractor in the Vietnam War. In addition, Caro argued that Johnson was awarded the Silver Star in World War II for political as well as military reasons, and that he later lied to journalists and the public about the circumstances for which it was awarded. Caro's portrayal of Johnson also notes his struggles on behalf of progressive causes such as the Voting Rights Act, and his consummate skill in getting this enacted in spite of intense opposition from Southern Democrats.\n\nAmong sources close to the late president, Johnson's widow Lady Bird Johnson \"spoke to [Caro] several times and then abruptly stopped without giving a reason, and Bill Moyers, Johnson's press secretary, has never consented to be interviewed, but most of Johnson's closest friends, including John Connally and George Christian, Johnson's last press secretary, who spoke to Caro practically on his deathbed, have gone on the record\".\n\nCaro's books have been published by Alfred A. Knopf, first under editor in chief Robert Gottlieb and then by Sonny Mehta, \"who took over the Johnson project – enthusiastically – after Gottlieb's departure in 1987.\" Gottlieb, five years Caro's senior, suggested the Johnson project to Caro in 1974 in preference to the planned follow-up to the Moses volume, a biography of Fiorello LaGuardia that was then abandoned. The ex-President had recently died and Caro had already decided, before meeting with Gottlieb on the subject, to undertake the Texan's biography; he \"wanted to write about power\". Gottlieb has continued as editor of Caro's books since leaving Knopf and excerpted Volume 2 of the Johnson biography at \"The New Yorker\" when he was editor in chief there.\n\nFor his biographies of Robert Moses and Lyndon Johnson, Robert A. Caro has twice won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography, three times won the National Book Critics Circle Award for the Best Nonfiction Book of the Year, and has won virtually every other major literary honor, including two National Book Awards (one for Lifetime Achievement), the Gold Medal in Biography from the American Academy of Art and Letters, and the Francis Parkman Prize.\n\nIn October 2007, Caro was named a \"Holtzbrinck Distinguished Visitor\" at the American Academy in Berlin, Germany but then was unable to attend.\n\nIn 2010, he received the National Humanities Medal from President Obama, the highest award in the humanities given in the United States. Delivering remarks at the end of the ceremony, the President said, \"I think about Robert Caro and reading \"The Power Broker\" back when I was 22 years old and just being mesmerized, and I'm sure it helped to shape how I think about politics.\" In 2011, Robert Caro was the recipient of the 2011 BIO Award given each year by members of Biographers International \"to a colleague who had made a major contribution in the advancement of the art and craft of real life depiction.\"\n\n\nCaro has described his wife, Ina Caro, as \"the whole team\" on all five of his books.

Bullard\n\nRobert Doyle Bullard (born December 21, 1946 in Elba, Alabama) is former Dean of the Barbara Jordan - Mickey Leland School Of Public Affairs (October 2011 - August 2016) and currently Distinguished Professor at Texas Southern University. Previously Ware Professor of Sociology and Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, Bullard is known as the 'father of environmental justice'. He has been a leading campaigner against environmental racism, as well as the foremost scholar of the problem, and of the Environmental Justice Movement which sprung up in the United States in the 1980s.\n\nBorn in Elba, Alabama, Robert Bullard is the son of Nehemiah and Myrtle Brundidge Bullard; he was \"the fourth of five children.\" He graduated from Elba's Mulberry Heights High School, as class salutorian, in 1964.\n\nContinuing his education, Bullard received a bachelor's degree in Government at Alabama A&M University, in Huntsville, in 1968. Upon graduating from college, he served two years in the United States Marine Corps, at an \"air control station in North Carolina\".\n\nHis M.A. in Sociology was earned at Atlanta University, in 1972. Bullard obtained his Ph.D. in Sociology at Iowa State University, in 1976, under the supervision of urban sociologist Robert (\"Bob\") O. Richards.\n\nIn 1979 Bullard's wife, attorney Linda McKeever Bullard, represented Margaret Bean and other Houston residents in their struggle against a plan that would locate a municipal landfill next to their homes. The lawsuit, Bean v. Southwestern Waste Management, Inc., was the first of its kind in the United States that charged environmental discrimination in waste facility siting under the civil rights laws. Houston's middle-class, suburban Northwood Manor neighborhood was an unlikely location for a garbage dump except that it was over 82 percent black. Bullard, having received his doctoral degree only a couple of years before, was drawn into the case as an expert witness. In this role Bullard conducted a study which documented the location of municipal waste disposal facilities in Houston. Entitled 'Solid Waste Sites and the Black Houston Community', the study was the first comprehensive account of ecoracism in the United States. Bullard and his researchers found that African American neighbourhoods in Houston were often chosen for toxic waste sites. All five city-owned garbage dumps, six of the eight city-owned garbage incinerators, and three of the four privately owned landfills were sited in black neighbourhoods, although blacks made up only 25 percent of the city's population. This discovery prompted Bullard to begin a long academic and activist campaign against environmental racism. \"Without a doubt\", Bullard has said of his experience, \"it was a form of apartheid where whites were making decisions and black people and brown people and people of color, including Native Americans on reservations, had no seat at the table.\"\n\nOver the 1980s Bullard widened his study of environmental racism to the whole American South, focusing on communities in Houston, in Dallas, Texas, Alsen, Louisiana, Institute, West Virginia, and Emelle, Alabama. Again he found a clear overrepresentaion of environmental hazards in black areas as compared to white areas, causing increased health risks to black citizens. In 1990 Bullard published his first book, \"Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class and Environmental Quality\". In the book, Bullard wrote that the Environmental Justice Movement, a grassroots movement by people of colour then spreading across America to protest environmental racism, signified a new convergence of the civil rights movement and the environmental movement of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1990 Bullard (then at the University of California-Riverside) became one leader of a group of prominent academics, later known as the Michigan Group, including Bunyan Bryant of the University of Michigan and Charles Lee of the United Church of Christ. The group wrote letters to Louis Sullivan, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and to William Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, asking for meetings with the officials to discuss governmental policy on environmental discrimination. Sullivan never responded, but Reilly met the advocacy group several times, resulting in the creation of the EPA's Work Group on Environmental Equity. This group later became the Office of Environmental Equity, and then the Office of Environmental Justice under EPA Administrator Carol Browner in 1993.\n\nBullard also played a key role in the organising of the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991. Starting out with a list of only 30 people of color groups working on environmental issues, Bullard expanded the list to over 300 groups by calling the leaders he knew personally and gathering information on other groups they had come across. It was these groups that attended the Leadership Summit in October 1991, at which a list of seventeen 'Principles of Environmental Justice' was adopted. Bullard's expanded list eventually included groups from outside the United States, including Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico, and has been published as the \"People of Color Environmental Group Directory\" by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation.\nIn 1994 President Bill Clinton signed the Environmental Justice Executive Order 12898 after advice and research by a National Environmental Justice Advisory Council (NEJAC), which included Professor Bullard, who chaired the Health and Research Subcommittee.\n\nBullard continued to act on behalf of struggling African American groups across the U.S. It was his expert testimony that won the case of Citizens Against Nuclear Trash (CANT) v. Louisiana Energy Services (LES) for the environmental justice group, directly causing the federal government's decision to deny the LES's permit for a uranium enrichment plant in Forest Grove and Center Springs, Louisiana. In 2006 when asked what keeps him going in his quest for environmental justice, Bullard answered, \"People who fight... People who do not let the garbage trucks and the landfills and the petrochemical plants roll over them. That has kept me in this movement for the last 25 years. And in the last 10 years, we've been winning: lawsuits are being won, reparations are being paid, apologies are being made. These companies have been put on notice that they can't do this anymore, anywhere.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6974982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6974982", "title": "Sailing stones", "text": "Sailing stones\n\nSailing stones, also known as sliding rocks, walking rocks, rolling stones, and moving rocks, are a geological phenomenon where rocks move and inscribe long tracks along a smooth valley floor without human or animal intervention. The movement of the rocks results when large ice sheets a few millimeters thick floating in an ephemeral winter pond start to break up during sunny days. Frozen during cold winter nights, these thin floating ice panels are driven by wind and shove rocks at speeds up to 5 meters per minute.\n\nTrails of sliding rocks have been observed and studied in various locations, including Little Bonnie Claire Playa in Nevada, and most famously at Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National Park, California, where the number and length of tracks are notable.\n\nThe Racetrack's stones speckle the playa floor, predominantly in the southern portion. Historical accounts identify some stones around from shore, yet most of the stones are found relatively close to their respective originating outcrops. Three lithologic types are identified: (1) syenite, found most abundant on the west side of the playa; (2) dolomite, subrounded blue-gray stones with white bands; and (3) black dolomite, the most common type, found almost always in angular joint blocks or slivers. This dolomite composes nearly all stones found in the southern half of the playa, and originates at a steep promontory, high, paralleling the east shore at the south end of the playa. Intrusive igneous rock originates from adjacent slopes (most of those being tan-colored feldspar-rich syenite). Tracks are often up to long, about wide, and typically much less than deep. Most moving stones range from about in diameter.\n\nStones with rough bottoms leave straight striated tracks, while those with smooth bottoms tend to wander. Stones sometimes turn over, exposing another edge to the ground and leaving a different track in the stone's wake.\n\nTrails differ in both direction and length. Rocks that start next to each other may travel parallel for a time, before one abruptly changes direction to the left, right, or even back to the direction from which it came. Trail length also varies – two similarly sized and shaped rocks may travel uniformly, then one could move ahead or stop in its track.\n\nA balance of very specific conditions is thought to be needed for stones to move:\n\nAt Racetrack Playa, these tracks have been studied since the early 1900s, yet the origins of stone movement were not confirmed and remained the subject of research for which several hypotheses existed. However, as of August 2014, timelapse video footage of rocks moving has been published, showing the rocks moving at high wind speeds within the flow of thin, melting sheets of ice. The scientists have thus identified the cause of the moving stones to be ice shove.\n\nThe first documented account of the sliding rock phenomenon dates to 1915, when a prospector named Joseph Crook from Fallon, Nevada, visited the Racetrack Playa site. In the following years, the Racetrack sparked interest from geologists Jim McAllister and Allen Agnew, who mapped the bedrock of the area in 1948 and published the earliest report about the sliding rocks in a Geologic Society of America Bulletin. Their publication gave a brief description of the playa furrows and scrapers, stating that no exact measurements had been taken and suggesting that furrows were the remnants of scrapers propelled by strong gusts of wind – such as the variable winds that produce dust-devils – over a muddy playa floor. Controversy over the origin of the furrows prompted the search for the occurrence of similar phenomena at other locations. Such a location was found at Little Bonnie Claire Playa in Nye County, Nevada, and the phenomenon was studied there, as well.\n\nNaturalists from the National Park Service later wrote more detailed descriptions and \"Life\" magazine featured a set of photographs from the Racetrack. In 1952, a National Park Service Ranger named Louis G. Kirk recorded detailed observations of furrow length, width, and general course. He sought simply to investigate and record evidence of the moving rock phenomenon, not to hypothesize or create an extensive scientific report. Speculation about how the stones move started at this time. Various and sometimes idiosyncratic possible explanations have been put forward over the years that have ranged from the supernatural to the very complex. Most hypotheses favored by interested geologists posit that strong winds when the mud is wet are at least in part responsible. Some stones weigh as much as a human, which some researchers, such as geologist George M. Stanley, who published a paper on the topic in 1955, feel is too heavy for the area's winds to move. After extensive track mapping and research on rotation of the tracks in relation to ice floe rotation, Stanley maintained that ice sheets around the stones either help to catch the wind or that ice floes initiate rock movement.\n\nBob Sharp and Dwight Carey started a Racetrack stone movement monitoring program in May 1972. Eventually, 30 stones with fresh tracks were labeled and stakes were used to mark their locations. Each stone was given a name and changes in the stones' positions were recorded over a seven-year period. Sharp and Carey also tested the ice floe hypothesis by corralling selected stones. A corral in diameter was made around a wide, track-making stone with seven rebar segments placed apart. If a sheet of ice around the stones either increased wind-catching surface area or helped move the stones by dragging them along in ice floes, then the rebar should at least slow down and deflect the movement. Neither appeared to occur; the stone barely missed a rebar as it moved to the northwest out of the corral in the first winter. Two heavier stones were placed in the corral at the same time; one moved five years later in the same direction as the first, but its companion did not move during the study period. This indicated that if ice played a part in stone movement, then ice collars around stones must be small.\n\nTen of the initial 30 stones moved in the first winter with Mary Ann (stone A) covering the longest distance at . Two of the next six monitored winters also had multiple stones move. No stones were confirmed to have moved in the summer, and in some winters, none or only a few stones moved. In the end, all but two of the monitored stones moved during the seven-year study. At in diameter, Nancy (stone H) was the smallest monitored stone. It also moved the longest cumulative distance, , and the greatest single winter movement, . The largest stone to move was .\n\nKaren (stone J) is a block of dolomite and weighs an estimated . Karen did not move during the monitoring period. The stone may have created its long, straight and old track from momentum gained from its initial fall onto the wet playa. However, Karen disappeared sometime before May 1994, possibly during the unusually wet winter of 1992 to 1993. Removal by artificial means is considered unlikely due to the lack of associated damage to the playa that a truck and winch would have caused. A possible sighting of Karen was made in 1994, from the playa. Karen was rediscovered by San Jose geologist Paula Messina in 1996.\n\nProfessor John Reid led six research students from Hampshire College and the University of Massachusetts Amherst in a follow-up study in 1995. They found highly congruent trails from stones that moved in the late 1980s and during the winter of 1992–93. At least some stones were proved beyond a reasonable doubt to have been moved in ice floes that may be up to wide. Physical evidence included swaths of lineated areas that could only have been created by moving thin sheets of ice. Consequently, both wind alone and wind in conjunction with ice floes are thought to be motive forces.\n\nPhysicists Bacon \"et al.\" studying the phenomenon in 1996, informed by studies in Owens Dry Lake Playa, discovered that winds blowing on playa surfaces can be compressed and intensified because of a playa's smooth, flat surfaces. They also found that boundary layers (the region just above ground where winds are slower due to ground drag) on these surfaces can be as low as . As a result, stones just a few centimeters high feel the full force of ambient winds and their gusts, which can reach in winter storms. Such gusts are thought to be the initiating force, while momentum and sustained winds keep the stones moving, possibly as fast as a moderate run.\n\nWind and ice both are the favored hypothesis for these sliding rocks. Noted in \"Surface Processes and Landforms\", Don J. Easterbrook mentions that because of the lack of parallel paths between some rock paths, this could be caused by degenerating ice floes resulting in alternate routes. Though the ice breaks up into smaller blocks, it is still necessary for the rocks to slide.\n\nFurther understanding of the geologic processes at work in Racetrack Playa goes hand in hand with technological development. In 2009, development of inexpensive time-lapse digital cameras allowed the capturing of transient meteorological phenomena including dust devils and playa flooding. These cameras were aimed at capturing various stages of the previously mentioned phenomena, though discussion of the sliding stones ensued. The developers of photographic technology describe the difficulty of capturing the Racetrack's stealthy rocks, as movements only occur about once every three years, and they believed, lasted about 10 seconds. Their next identified advancement was wind-triggered imagery, vastly reducing the ten million seconds of nontransit time they had to sift through.\n\nIt was postulated that small rafts of ice form around the rocks and the rocks are buoyantly floated off the soft bed, thus reducing the reaction and friction forces at the bed. Since this effect depends on reducing friction, and not on increasing the wind drag, these ice cakes need not have a particularly large surface area if the ice is adequately thick, as the minimal friction allows the rocks to be moved by arbitrarily light winds.\n\nReinforcing the \"ice raft\" theory, a research study pointed out narrowing trails, occurrence of intermittent spring systems, and absence of rocks at the end of the trails. The study identified the Racetrack mountain area that drains water towards the Racetrack Playa, while ice covered the intermittent lake. This suggests that this water buoyantly lifts the icebergs with embedded rocks until friction with the playa bed is reduced sufficiently for wind forces to move them and cause the observed tracks. The study also provides mapping and analysis of the effect of artificial ditch preventing the visitors from driving on the playa and they claim that it may interfere with the sliding rock phenomenon.\n\nNews articles reported the mystery solved when researchers observed rock movements using GPS and time-lapse photography. The research team witnessed and documented rock movement on December 20, 2013, that involved more than 60 rocks, with some rocks moving up to 224 m between December 2013 and January 2014 in multiple movement events. These observations contradicted earlier hypotheses of winds or thick ice floating rocks off the surface. Instead, rocks move when large ice sheets a few millimeters thick floating in an ephemeral winter pond start to break up during sunny days. These thin floating ice panels, frozen during cold winter nights, are driven by light winds and shove rocks at up to 5 m/min (0.3 km/h). Some GPS-measured moves lasted up to 16 minutes, and a number of stones moved more than five times during the existence of the playa pond in the winter of 2013-14.\n\nRalph Lorenz, a planetary scientist, investigated the phenomenon in 2006. To illustrate the \"ice raft\" theory, Lorenz developed an experiment using a kitchen-table model using a container to show how heavy rocks might glide across the surface of the lake bed. A bed of sand is added to the bottom of the Tupperware, a rock is placed on the sand, and water is added until only a small edge of the rock sticks out. After putting the container in the freezer until the water is frozen, then removing the container and letting the ice begin to melt, Lorenz could end up with a small raft of floating ice with a rock embedded in it. All he had to do was gently blow on the floating ice sheet to get the rock to drag across the sand. While these experiments, and the buoyant lifting of rocks, are doubtless relevant on some occasions, the January 2014 trail-forming events did not appear to rely on buoyancy, but the rocks were simply bulldozed.\n\nBecause rock movement relies on a very rare set of circumstances, namely the usually-dry playa being flooded, and cold conditions to allow the water to freeze, drier winters and warmer winter nights would cause such circumstances to occur less often. A statistical study by Ralph Lorenz and Brian Jackson examining published reports of rock movements suggested (with 4:1 odds) an apparent decline between the 1960s-1990s, and the 21st century.\n\nOn 30 May 2013, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that park officials were looking into the theft of several of the rocks from the Death Valley National Park.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9736729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9736729", "title": "Sentence processing", "text": "Sentence processing\n\nSentence processing takes place whenever a reader or listener processes a language utterance, either in isolation or in the context of a conversation or a text.\n\nMany studies of the human language comprehension process have focused on reading of single utterances (sentences) without context. Extensive research has shown, however, that language comprehension is affected also by context preceding a given utterance, as well as many other factors.\n\nSentence comprehension has to deal with ambiguity in spoken and written utterances, for example lexical, structural, and semantic ambiguities. Ambiguity is ubiquitous, but people usually resolve it so effortlessly that they do not even notice it. For example, the sentence \"Time flies like an arrow\" has (at least) the interpretations \"Time moves as quickly as an arrow\", \"A special kind of fly, called time fly, likes arrows\" and \"Measure the speed of flies like you would measure the speed of an arrow\". Usually, readers will be aware of only the first interpretation. Educated readers though, spontaneously think about the arrow of time but inhibit that interpretation because it deviates from the original phrase and the temporal lobe acts as a switch.\nInstances of ambiguity can be classified as local or global ambiguities. A sentence is globally ambiguous if it has two distinct interpretations. Examples are sentences like \"Someone shot the servant of the actress who was on the balcony\" (was it the servant or the actress who was on the balcony?) or \"The cop chased the criminal with a fast car\" (did the cop or the criminal have a fast car?). Comprehenders may have a preferential interpretation for either of these cases, but syntactically and semantically, neither of the possible interpretations can be ruled out.\n\nLocal ambiguities persist only for a short amount of time as an utterance is heard or written and are resolved during the course of the utterance so the complete utterance has only one interpretation. Examples include sentences like \"The critic wrote the book was enlightening\", which is ambiguous when \"The critic wrote the book\" has been encountered, but \"was enlightening\" remains to be processed. Then, the sentence could end, stating that the critic is the author of the book, or it could go on to clarify that the critic wrote something about a book. The ambiguity ends at \"was enlightening\", which determines that the second alternative is correct.\n\nWhen readers process a local ambiguity, they settle on one of the possible interpretations immediately without waiting to hear or read more words that might help decide which interpretation is correct (the behaviour is called \"incremental processing\"). If readers are surprised by the turn the sentence really takes, processing is slowed and is visible for example in reading times. Locally-ambiguous sentences have, therefore, been used as test cases to investigate the influence of a number of different factors on human sentence processing. If a factor helps readers to avoid difficulty, it is clear that the factor plays a factor in sentence processing.\n\nExperimental research has spawned a large number of hypotheses about the architecture and mechanisms of sentence comprehension. Issues like modularity versus interactive processing and serial versus parallel computation of analyses have been theoretical divides in the field.\n\nA modular view of sentence processing assumes that each factor involved in sentence processing is computed in its own module, which has limited means of communication with the other modules. For example, syntactic analysis creation takes place without input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information, which are processed separately. A common assumption of modular accounts is a \"feed-forward\" architecture in which the output of one processing step is passed on to the next step without feedback mechanisms that would allow the output of the first module to be corrected. Syntactic processing is usually taken to be the most basic analysis step, which feeds into semantic processing and the inclusion of other information. A separate mental module parses sentences and lexical access happens first. Then, one syntactic hypothesis is considered at a time. There is no initial influence of meaning, or semantic. Sentence processing is supported by a temporo-frontal network. Within the network, temporal regions subserve aspects of identification and frontal regions the building of syntactic and semantic relations. Temporal analyses of brain activation within this network support syntax-first models because they reveal that building of syntactic structure precedes semantic processes and that these interact only during a later stage.\n\nInteractive accounts assume that all available information is processed at the same time and can immediately influence the computation of the final analysis. In the interactive model of sentence processing, there is no separate module for parsing. Lexical access, syntactic structure assignment, and meaning assignment happen at the same time in parallel. Several syntactic hypotheses can be considered at a time. The interactive model demonstrates an on-line interaction between the structural and lexical and phonetic levels of sentence processing. Each word, as it is heard in the context of normal discourse, is immediately entered into the processing system at all levels of description, and is simultaneously analyzed at all these levels in the light of whatever information is available at each level at that point in the processing of the sentence. Interactive models of language processing assume that information flows both bottom-up and top-down, so that the representations formed at each level may be influenced by higher as well as lower levels. A framework called the interactive activation framework that embeds this key assumption among others, including the assumption that influences from different sources are combined nonlinearly. The nonlinearity means that information that may be decisive under some circumstances may have little or no effect under other conditions. In the interactive activation framework, the knowledge that guides processing is stored in the connections between units on the same and adjacent levels. The processing units that they connect may receive input from a number of different sources, which allows the knowledge that guides processing to be completely local while, at the same time, allowing the results of processing at one level to influence processing at other levels, both above and below. A basic assumption of the framework is that processing interactions are always reciprocal; it is this bi-directional characteristic that makes the system interactive. Bi-directional excitatory interactions between levels allow mutual simultaneous constraint among adjacent levels, and bi-diectional inhibitory interactions within a level allow for competition among mutually incompatible interpretations of a portion of an input. The between-level excitatory interactions are captured in the models in two-way excitatory connections between mutually compatible processing units. Syntactic ambiguities are in fact based at the lexical level. In addition, more recent studies with more sensitive eyetracking machines have shown early context effects. Frequency and contextual information will modulate the activation of alternatives even when they are resolved in favor of the simple interpretation. Structural simplicity is cofounded with frequency, which goes against the garden path theory\n\nSerial accounts assume that humans construct only one of the possible interpretations at first and try another only if the first one turns out to be wrong. Parallel accounts assume the construction of multiple interpretations at the same time. To explain why comprehenders are usually only aware of one possible analysis of what they hear, models can assume that all analyses ranked, and the highest-ranking one is entertained.\n\nThere are a number of influential models of human sentence processing that draw on different combinations of architectural choices.\n\nThe garden path model is a serial modular parsing model. It proposes that a single parse is constructed by a syntactic module. Contextual and semantic factors influence processing at a later stage and can induce re-analysis of the syntactic parse. Re-analysis is costly and leads to an observable slowdown in reading. When the parser encounters an ambiguity, it is guided by two principles: late closure and minimal attachment. The model has been supported with research on the early left anterior negativity, an event-related potential often elicited as a response to phrase structure violations.\n\nLate closure causes new words or phrases to be attached to the current clause. For example, \"John said he would leave yesterday\" would be parsed as \"John said (he would leave yesterday)\", and not as \"John said (he would leave) yesterday\" (i.e., he spoke yesterday).\n\nMinimal attachment is a strategy of parsimony: The parser builds the simplest syntactic structure possible (that is, the one with the fewest phrasal nodes).\n\nConstraint-based theories of language comprehension emphasize how people make use of the vast amount of probabilistic information available in the linguistic signal. Through statistical learning, the frequencies and distribution of events in linguistic environments can be picked upon, which inform language comprehension. As such, language users are said to arrive at a particular interpretation over another during the comprehension of an ambiguous sentence by rapidly integrating these probabilistic constraints.\n\nThe good enough approach to language comprehension assumes that listeners do not always engage in full detailed \nprocessing of linguistic input. Rather, the system has a tendency to develop shallow and superficial representations \nwhen confronted with some difficulty. The theory takes an approach that somewhat combines both the garden path model and the constraint based model. The theory focuses on two main issues. The first is that representations formed from complex or difficult material are often shallow and incomplete. The second is that limited information sources are often consulted in cases where the comprehension system encounters difficulty. The theory can be put to test using various experiments in psycholinguistics that involve garden path misinterpretation, etc.\n\nIn behavioral studies, subjects are often presented with linguistic stimuli and asked to perform an action. For example, they may be asked to make a judgment about a word (lexical decision), reproduce the stimulus, or name a visually presented word aloud. Speed (often reaction time: time taken to respond to the stimulus) and accuracy (proportion of correct responses) are commonly employed measures of performance in behavioral tasks. Researchers infer that the nature of the underlying process(es) required by the task gives rise to differences; slower rates and lower accuracy on these tasks are taken as measures of increased difficulty. An important component of any behavioral task is that it stays relatively true to 'normal' language comprehension—the ability to generalize the results of any task is restricted when the task has little in common with how people actually encounter language.\n\nA common behavioral paradigm involves priming effects, wherein participants are presented first with a prime and then with a target word. The response time for the target word is affected by the relationship between the prime and the target. For example, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding using the lexical decision task. She asked participants to make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words. Sometimes the strings would be actual English words requiring a \"yes\" response, and other times they would be nonwords requiring a \"no\" response. A subset of the licit words were related semantically (e.g., cat-dog) while others were unrelated (e.g., bread-stem). Fischler found that related word pairs were responded to faster when compared to unrelated word pairs, which suggests that semantic relatedness can facilitate word encoding.\n\nEye tracking has been used to study online language processing. This method has been influential in informing knowledge of reading. Additionally, Tanenhaus et al. (1995) established the visual world paradigm, which takes advantage of eye movements to study online spoken language processing. This area of research capitalizes on the linking hypothesis that eye movements are closely linked to the current focus of attention.\n\nThe rise of non-invasive techniques provides myriad opportunities for examining the brain bases of language comprehension. Common examples include positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), event-related potentials (ERPs) in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). These techniques vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions (fMRI has a resolution of a few thousand neurons per pixel, and ERP has millisecond accuracy), and each type of methodology presents a set of advantages and disadvantages for studying a particular problem in language comprehension.\n\nComputational modeling is another means by which to explore language comprehension. Models, such as those instantiated in neural networks, are particularly useful because they requires theorists to be explicit in their hypotheses and because they can be used to generate accurate predictions for theoretical models that are so complex that they render discursive analysis unreliable. A classic example of computational modeling in language research is McClelland and Elman's TRACE model of speech perception. A model of sentence processing can be found in Hale (2011)'s 'rational' Generalized Left Corner parser. This model derives garden path effects as well as local coherence phenomena.\n\n\n"}

Megiddo is known for its historical, geographical, and theological importance, especially under its Greek name Armageddon. During the Bronze Age, Megiddo was an important Canaanite city-state and during the Iron Age, a royal city in the Kingdom of Israel. Megiddo drew much of its importance from its strategic location at the northern end of the Wadi Ara defile, which acts as a pass through the Carmel Ridge, and from its position overlooking the rich Jezreel Valley from the west. Excavations have unearthed 26 layers of ruins, indicating a long period of settlement.\n\nSome Christians believe that Armageddon will be the site of the final battle between Jesus Christ and the kings of the Earth who go to war against Israel, as outlined in the Book of Revelation.\n\nThe site is now protected as Megiddo National Park and is a World Heritage Site.\n\nMegiddo is also known as , Megiddó/Mageddón in the Septuagint; ; Assyrian: Magiddu, Magaddu; Magidda and Makida in the Amarna tablets; Egyptian: Maketi, Makitu, and Makedo. The Book of Revelation mentions an apocalyptic battle at Armageddon, a Greek name of the site, derived from the Hebrew \"Har Megiddo\", meaning \"Mount of Megiddo\". \"Armageddon\" has become a byword for the end of the world.\n\nMegiddo was a site of great importance in the ancient world. It guarded the western branch of a narrow pass on the most important trade route of the ancient Fertile Crescent, linking Egypt with Mesopotamia and Asia Minor and known today as Via Maris. Because of its strategic location, Megiddo was the site of several historical battles. The site was inhabited from approximately 7000 BCE to 586 BCE though the first significant remains date to the Chalcolithic period (4500–3500 BCE).\n\nMegiddo's Early Bronze Age I (3500–3100 BCE) temple has been described by its excavators as \"the most monumental single edifice so far uncovered in the EB I Levant and ranks among the largest structures of its time in the Near East.\" The first wall was constructed in the Early Bronze Age II or III period.\n\nThe town experienced a decline in the Early Bronze Age IV period (2300–2000 BCE), but was somewhat revived around 2000 BCE.\n\nFollowing massive construction, the town reached its largest size in the Middle Bronze Age, at 10–12 hectares.\n\nThough the city was subjugated by Thutmose III (r. 1479–1425 BCE), it still prospered, and a massive and incredibly elaborate palace was constructed in the Late Bronze Age.\n\nThe city was destroyed around 1150 BCE, and the area was resettled by what some scholars have identified as early Israelites, before being replaced with an unwalled Philistine town. When the Israelites captured it, though, it became an important city, before being destroyed, possibly by Aramaean raiders, and rebuilt, this time as an administrative center for Tiglath-Pileser III's occupation of Samaria. However, its importance soon dwindled, and it was finally abandoned around 586 BCE. Since that time it has remained uninhabited, preserving ruins pre-dating 586 BCE without settlements ever disturbing them. Instead, the town of al-Lajjun (not to be confused with the al-Lajjun archaeological site in Jordan) was built up near to the site, but without inhabiting or disturbing its remains.\n\nKibbutz Megiddo is nearby, less than to the south. Today, Megiddo Junction is on the main road connecting the center of Israel with lower Galilee and the north. It lies at the northern entrance to Wadi Ara, an important mountain pass connecting the Jezreel Valley with Israel's coastal plain.\n\nIn 1964, during Pope Paul VI's visit to the Holy Land, Megiddo was the site where he met with Israeli dignitaries, including Israeli President Zalman Shazar and Prime Minister Levi Eshkol.\n\nFamous battles include:\n\nMegiddo has been excavated three times and is currently being excavated yet again. The first excavations were carried out between 1903 and 1905 by Gottlieb Schumacher for the German Society for the Study of Palestine. Techniques used were rudimentary by later standards and Schumacher's field notes and records were destroyed in World War I before being published. After the war, Carl Watzinger published the remaining available data from the dig.\n\nIn 1925, digging was resumed by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, financed by John D. Rockefeller, Jr., continuing until the outbreak of the Second World War. The work was led initially by Clarence S. Fisher, and later by P. L. O. Guy, Robert Lamon, and Gordon Loud.\nto serve as a spoil area. The full results of that excavation were not published until decades later.\nYigael Yadin conducted excavations in 1960, 1966, 1967, and 1971 for the Hebrew University. The formal results of those digs were published by Anabel Zarzecki-Peleg in Hebrew University's monograph 2016 \"Qedem\" 56.\nMegiddo has most recently (since 1994) been the subject of biannual excavation campaigns conducted by the Megiddo Expedition of Tel Aviv University, currently co-directed by Israel Finkelstein and David Ussishkin, with Eric H. Cline of The George Washington University serving as Associate Director (USA), together with a consortium of international universities. One notable feature of the dig is close on-site co-operation between archaeologists and specialist scientists, with detailed chemical analysis being performed at the dig itself using a field infrared spectrometer.\n\nIn 2010, the Jezreel Valley Regional Project, directed by Matthew J. Adams of Bucknell University in cooperation with the Megiddo Expedition, undertook excavations of the eastern extension of the Early Bronze Age town of Megiddo, at the site known as Tel Megiddo (East).\n\nA path leads up through a Solomonic gateway overlooking the excavations of the Oriental Institute. A solid circular stone structure has been interpreted as an altar or a high place from the Canaanite period. Further on is a grain pit from the Israelite period for storing provisions in case of siege; the stables, originally thought to date from the time of Solomon but now dated a century and a half later to the time of Ahab; and a water system consisting of a square shaft deep, the bottom of which opens into a tunnel bored through rock for to a pool of water.\n\nMegiddo's 5,000 year old \"Great Temple\", dated to the Early Bronze Age I (3500–3100 BCE), has been described by its excavators as \"the most monumental single edifice so far uncovered in the EB I Levant and ranks among the largest structures of its time in the Near East.\" The structure includes an immense, 47.5 by 22 meters sanctuary. The temple is more than ten times larger than the typical temple of that era. The first wall was constructed in the Early Bronze Age II or III period. It was determined that the temple was the site of ritual animal sacrifice. Corridors were used as \"favissae\" (deposits of cultic artifacts) to store bones after ritual sacrifice. More than 80% of the animal remains were of young sheep and goats; the rest were cattle.\n\nIn 2010, a collection of jewelry pieces was found in a ceramic jug The jewelry dates to around 1100 BCE The collection includes beads made of carnelian stone, a ring and earrings. The jug was subjected to molecular analysis to determine the contents. The collection was probably owned by a wealthy Canaanite family, likely belonging to the ruling elite.\n\nThe Megiddo ivories are thin carvings in ivory found at Tel Megiddo, the majority excavated by Gordon Loud. The ivories are on display at the Oriental Institute of Chicago and the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. They were found in the stratum VIIA, or Late Bronze Age layer of the site. Carved from hippopotamus incisors from the Nile, they show Egyptian stylistic influence. An ivory pen case was found inscribed with the cartouche of Ramses III.\n\nAt Megiddo two stable complexes were excavated from Stratum IVA, one in the north and one in the south. The southern complex contained five structures built around a lime paved courtyard. The buildings themselves were divided into three sections. Two long stone paved aisles were built adjacent to a main corridor paved with lime. The buildings were about twenty-one meters long by eleven meters wide. Separating the main corridor from outside aisles was a series of stone pillars. Holes were bored into many of these pillars so that horses could be tied to them. Also, the remains of stone mangers were found in the buildings. These mangers were placed between the pillars to feed the horses. It is suggested that each side could hold fifteen horses, giving each building an overall capacity of thirty horses. The buildings on the northern side of the city were similar in their construction. However, there was no central courtyard. The capacity of the northern buildings was about three hundred horses altogether. Both complexes could hold from 450–480 horses combined.\n\nThe buildings were found during excavations between 1927 and 1934. The head excavator originally interpreted the buildings as stables. Since then his conclusions have been challenged by James Pritchard, Dr Adrian Curtis of Manchester University Ze'ev Herzog, and Yohanan Aharoni, who suggest they were storehouses, marketplaces or barracks.\n\nThe Megiddo church is not on the tell of Megiddo, but nearby next to Megiddo Junction inside the precinct of the Megiddo Prison. It was built within the ancient city of Legio and is believed to date to the 3rd century, which would make it one of the oldest churches in the world.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1034781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1034781", "title": "Vulgarity", "text": "Vulgarity\n\nVulgarity is the quality of being common, coarse, or unrefined. This judgement may refer to language, visual art, social classes, or social climbers. John Bayley claims it can never be self-referential because, to be aware of vulgarity is to display a degree of sophistication which thereby elevates the subject above the vulgar.\n\nFrom the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, \"vulgar\" simply described the common language or vernacular of a country. From the mid-seventeenth century onward, it began to take on a pejorative aspect: \"having a common and offensively mean character, coarsely commonplace; lacking in refinement or good taste; uncultured; ill bred\". In the Victorian age, vulgarity broadly described many sorts of activity, such as wearing ostentatious clothing, and other similarly subtle aspects of behavior. In a George Eliot novel, one character could be vulgar for talking about money, a second because he criticizes the first for doing so, and a third for being fooled by the excessive refinement of the second.\n\nIn language, the effort to avoid vulgarity could leave characters at a loss for words. In George Meredith's \"Beauchamp's Career\", an heiress does not wish to make the commonplace statement that she is \"engaged\", nor \"betrothed\", \"affianced\", or \"plighted\". Though such words are not vulgarity in the vulgar sense, they nonetheless could stigmatize the user as a member of a socially inferior class. Even favored euphemisms such as \"toilet\" eventually become stigmatized like the words they replace, and currently favored words serve as a sort of \"cultural capital\".\n\nVulgarity, or vulgar speech or language, can refer to language which is offensive or obscene, synonymous with the 'general' meaning of profanity.\n\nThe word most associated with the verbal form of vulgarity is \"cursing.\" However, there are many subsections of vulgar words. In the book, \"Cursing in America\" by Timothy Jay, Jay makes a classification of the \"dirty words\" because it \"allows people interested in language to define the different types of reference or meaning that dirty words employ. One can see that what is considered taboo or obscene revolves around a few dimensions of human experience that there is a logic behind dirty word usage.\" One of the most commonly used vulgar terms in the English language is \"fuck\".\n\nCurse words, or cursing, have been recognized by religious organizations as being able to cause actual mental and physical harm. More recently such words have separated themselves from their religious meanings, and it is doubtful that those who use curse words imagine the words will bring actual mental or physical harm. Both parties are aware that the cursing is simply an expression, and the ones receiving the curse words or phrase are aware they are being targeted.\n\nReligious curses may include \"Damn you\", \"God damn you\", \"To hell with you\". Cursing also includes non-religious expressions, like \"Fuck you\" or \"Eat shit and die\".\n\nProfanity are words that are considered hateful or contemptuous, especially in regard to religion. \n\nFor a word or phrase to be profane it must not be religious or function outside the duties of religious belief. To be profane means for the word or phrase to be ignorant or hateful towards the rules of religions. Examples of profanity are words or a phrase not meant to belittle Gods, their religions, but situated on the ignorance and indifference to such points.\n"}
