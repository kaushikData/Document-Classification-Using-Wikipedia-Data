It can also be thought of as part of the Creacionismo (Creationism literary movement) along with Pablo Nerudas \"Residencia en la Tierra\", César Vallejo's \"Trilcel\", and Pablo de Rokha's \"Los gemidos\".\n\nThe name \"altazor\" is a combination of the noun \"altura\" (\"altitude\") and the adjective \"azorado\" (\"bewildered\" or \"taken aback\"). \"Azorado\" has more than one meaning in Spanish and can be interpreted in different ways.\n\nThe poem is divided in seven \"cantos\", (\"songs\"), preceded by a preface. These cantos were written over an extensive period of time, from 1919 to 1931, and for that reason the topics seem unrelated. The first canto is the longest with almost seven hundred verses, and its content feels metaphysical. In this first canto, the poet introduces himself as \"Altazor\". The second canto, by contrast, is an ode to women, while in cantos III to VII the author plays with and dismantles the language and its expressive limits.\n\n\nThe book includes a Picasso portrait of Huidobro. In honour of Huidobro's work, the poem has been used to name the Chilean Award of the National Arts, known as the Altazor Award.\n\n"}

They are often broader in scope than the theories of value of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, etc. usually including sociological, political, institutional, and historical perspectives (transdisciplinarity). Some have influenced feminist economics.\n\nThe basic premise is that economic activities can only be fully understood in the context of the society that creates them. The concept of \"value\" is a social construct, and as such is defined by the culture using the concept. Yet we can gain some insights into modern patterns of exchange, value, and wealth by examining previous societies. An anthropological approach to economic processes allows us to critically examine the cultural biases inherent in the principles of modern economics. Anthropological linguistics is a related field that looks at the terms we use to describe economic relations and the ecologies they are set within. Many anthropological economists (or economic anthropologists) are reacting against what they see as the portrayal of modern society as an economic machine that merely produces and consumes.\n\nMarcel Mauss and Bronisław Malinowski for example wrote about objects that circulate in society without being consumed. Georges Bataille wrote about objects that are destroyed, but not consumed. Bruce Owens talks about objects of value that are neither circulating nor consumed (e.g. gold reserves, warehoused paintings, family heirlooms).\n\nDavid Graeber attempts to synthesize the insights of Karl Marx and Marcel Mauss. He sees value as a model for human meaning-making. Starting with Marxist definitions of consumption and production, he introduces Mauss's idea of \"objects that are not consumed\" and posits that the majority of human behavior consists of activities that would not be properly categorized as either consumption or production.\n\nA list of things that are neither consumption nor production in 2003 includes those human activities that are not consumption, in the narrow sense of simply purchasing something, and are not production, in the sense of creating or modifying something intended for sale or exchange, namely:\nEconomists typically use the term consumption in a way that is far broader than merely purchasing something. It is quite common to talk about the consumption of time. Many of the items on this list can still be considered either production or consumption, or to involve production or consumption at some stage to be accomplished. For example, cooking a meal is production of food for someone's consumption, and it involves consuming (cooking) raw materials previously purchased or gathered; and, writing is production of material for someone to consume through reading. Both of these activities are often done for some return in value, whether it is for respect or monetary payment. In a similar way, some of these items are replacements for consumption – for example, rather than purchase a meal, you can cook the meal yourself. In cooking the meal, you have now in effect paid for the meal with your own labor rather than earning wages and paying for a meal with those wages. In this way, economists, and in general anyone, could view this list as containing nothing that is not consumption or production, other than possibly turning around in a circle, though this involves consuming calories that would, at some point, have been consumed. For example, even window shoppers are consuming – the product is marketers’ production (specifically in this case, the window dresser's creation). Possibly, only in death are we neither consuming nor producing, but merely being consumed, though it could be argued that one's body is consuming space, particularly in a cemetery plot (real estate), but even if cremated and scattered. Gary Becker's household production functions and similar topics note that people often purchase goods and then combine them with time to produce something that has meaning or practicality to them (which produce utility).\n\n"}

An anti-society is a small, separate community intentionally created within a larger society as an alternative to or resistance of it. For example, Adam Podgorecki studied one anti-society composed of Polish prisoners; Bhaktiprasad Mallik of Sanskrit College studied another composed of criminals in Calcutta. Anti-languages are developed by these societies as a means to prevent outsiders from understanding their communication, and as a manner of establishing a subculture that meets the needs of their alternative social structure. Anti-languages differ from slang and jargon in that they are used solely among ostracized or rebellious social groups including prisoners, criminals, homosexuals, and teenagers. Anti-languages use the same basic vocabulary and grammar as their native language in an unorthodox fashion. For example, anti-languages borrow words from other languages, create unconventional compounds, or utilize new suffixes for existing words. Anti-languages may also change words using metathesis, back formation (e.g. apple to elppa), or by substituting their consonants. Therefore, anti-languages are distinct and unique, and are not simply dialects of existing languages.\n\nThe concept of anti-languages was first defined and studied by the linguist Michael Alexander Kirkwood Halliday, who used the term to describe the lingua franca of an anti-society. In his essay \"Anti-Language\", Halliday synthesized the research of Thomas Harman, Adam Podgórecki, and Bhaktiprasad Mallik to explore anti-languages and the connection between verbal communication and the maintenance of social structure. For this reason, the study of anti-languages is both a study of sociology and linguistics. Halliday's findings can be compiled as a list of nine criteria that a language must meet to be considered an anti-language:\n\n\nExamples of anti-languages include cockney rhyming slang, CB slang, the \"grypsera\" of Polish prisons, thieves' cant, Polari, and possibly Palawa kani and Bangime.\n\nUlti is a language studied and documented by Bhaktiprasad Mallik in his book \"Languages of the Underworld of West Bengal.\" Ulti is an anti-language derived from Bengali and used by criminals and affiliates. The Ulti word \"kodān,\" meaning 'shop,' is derived from rearranging the letters in the Bengali word \"dokān\", which also means 'shop'. On the other hand, the Bengali word \"thām\", meaning 'pillar', means 'a girl's thigh' in Ulti.\n\nAnti-languages are sometimes created by authors and used by characters in novels. These anti-languages do not have complete lexicons, cannot be observed in use for linguistic description, and therefore cannot be studied in the same way that a language that is actually spoken by an existing anti-society would. However, they are still used in the study of anti-languages. Roger Fowler's \"Anti-Languages in Fiction\" analyzes Anthony Burgess's \"A Clockwork Orange\" and William S. Burroughs' \"Naked Lunch\" to redefine the nature of the anti-language and to describe its ideological purpose.\n\n\"A Clockwork Orange\" is a popular example of a novel in which the main character is a teenage boy who speaks an anti-language called Nadsat. This language is often referred to as an argot, but it has been argued that it is an anti-language because of the social structure that it maintains through the social class of the droogs.\n\n\n"}

Its full title is the \"Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research, Report of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research\".\n\nThe report was issued on 30 September 1978 and published in the Federal Register on 18 April 1979. The report took its name from the Belmont Conference Center where the document was drafted in part. The Belmont Conference Center, once a part of the Smithsonian Institution, is in Elkridge, Maryland, 10 miles south of Baltimore, and until the end of 2010 was operated by Howard Community College.\n\nThe \"Belmont Report\" summarizes ethical principles and guidelines for research involving human subjects. Three core principles are identified: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Three primary areas of application are also stated. They are informed consent, assessment of risks and benefits, and selection of subjects.\nAccording to Vollmer and Howard, the \"Belmont Report\" allows for a positive solution, which at times may be difficult to find, to future subjects who are not capable to make independent decisions.\n\nThe \"Belmont Report\" was first written by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Services of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. Prompted in part by problems arising from the Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932–1972) and based on the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research (1974–1978), the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) revised and expanded its regulations for the protection of human subjects 45 CFR part 46 in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1978, the Commission’s report \"Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research\" was released, and it was published in 1979 in the Federal Register. It was named the \"Belmont Report\", for the Belmont Conference Center, where the National Commission met when first drafting the report.\nThe \"Belmont Report\" is one of the leading works concerning ethics and health care research. It allows for the protection of participants in clinical trials and research studies.\n\nThe \"Belmont Report\" explains the unifying ethical principles that form the basis for the National Commission’s topic-specific reports and the regulations that incorporate its recommendations.\n\nThe three fundamental ethical principles for using any human subjects for research are:\n\nThese principles remain the basis for the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) human subject protection regulations.\n\nToday, the \"Belmont Report\" continues as an essential reference for institutional review boards (IRBs) that review HHS-conducted or -supported human subjects research proposals involving human subjects, in order to ensure that the research meets the ethical foundations of the regulations.\n\nApplications of these principles to conduct research requires careful consideration of i) informed consent, ii) risks benefit assessment, and iii)selection of subjects of research.\n\nOutlined by Jennifer Sims in her article \"A brief review of the \"Belmont Report\"\", she states 7 things nurses, as primary caregivers for individuals participating in a study, must do to ensure the rights of the participant is met. \n\nResearchers must share the findings of their procedures regardless of them being good or bad results. Also in the case someone did not want to participate in research but would like treatment they cannot be turned away and must be treated with the same standard care.\n\nThe summary, from the top of the Report:\nOn July 12, 1974, the National Research Act (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law, there-by creating the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. One of the charges to the Commission was to identify the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and to develop guidelines which should be followed to assure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles. In carrying out the above, the Commission was directed to consider: (i) the boundaries between biomedical and behavioral research and the accepted and routine practice of medicine, (ii) the role of assessment of risk-benefit criteria in the determination of the appropriateness of research involving human subjects, (iii) appropriate guidelines for the selection of human subjects for participation in such research and (iv) the nature and definition of informed consent in various research settings.\n\nThe Belmont Report attempts to summarize the basic ethical principles identified by the Commission in the course of its deliberations. It is the outgrowth of an intensive four-day period of discussions that were held in February 1976 at the Smithsonian Institution's Belmont Conference Center supplemented by the monthly deliberations of the Commission that were held over a period of nearly four years. It is a statement of basic ethical principles and guidelines that should assist in resolving the ethical problems that surround the conduct of research with human subjects. By publishing the Report in the Federal Register, and providing reprints upon request, the Secretary intends that it may be made readily available to scientists, members of Institutional Review Boards, and Federal employees. The two-volume Appendix, containing the lengthy reports of experts and specialists who assisted the Commission in fulfilling this part of its charge, is available as DHEW Publication No. (OS) 78-0013 and No. (OS) 78-0014, for sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.\n\nUnlike most other reports of the Commission, the Belmont Report does not make specific recommendations for administrative action by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Rather, the Commission recommended that the Belmont Report be adopted in its entirety, as a statement of the Department's policy. The Department requests public comment on this recommendation.\nIn 1991, 14 other Federal departments and agencies joined HHS in adopting a uniform set of rules for the protection of human subjects, identical to subpart A of 45 CFR part 46 of the HHS regulations. This uniform set of regulations is the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, informally known as the \"Common Rule\". The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) was also established within HHS.\n\nToday, the \"Belmont Report\" serves as a historical document and provides the moral framework for understanding regulations in the United States on the use of humans in experimental methods.\n\nIn a study by Nancy Shore, community-based participatory researchers were interviewed for their interpretation and critique of the \"Belmont Report\". Interviewees expressed concerns regarding the \"Belmont Report\"s ethical principles and interpretations as being one size fits all and advocated researchers to resist the tendency to rely on those principles systematically. It argues that the ethical analysis should be extended to take into account more appropriate factors, such as cultural, gender, ethnic and geographical considerations. Debate continues over the ethics and regulations of research involving human subjects because of discrepancies over the meaning and priority of the \"Belmont Report\"s basic ethical principles: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Notably, the \"Belmont Report\" does not specify how its three ethical principles should be weighted or prioritized. According to Albert R. Jonsen, a member of the National Commission that composed the report, the Institutional Review Board is charged with weighing these principles and deciding how they should be applied. Matters become controversial when deciding if the principles should be interpreted as more or less weighty depending upon the particular circumstances of the research in question, if the principles should be viewed as an obligation that society must undertake on behalf of its members, or if it should be viewed as giving absolute priority to respect for persons’ autonomy over the general good of society.\n\n\n"}

There are two kinds: consultative case stated and appeal by way of case stated. A consultative case stated is made at the discretion of a judge before he or she determines the case before the court. An appeal by way of case stated is made at the request of a party to the proceedings to the judge after the conclusion of a case.\n\nOn the hearing of a case stated, the higher court is restricted to consideration of the law alone and is required to accept the statement of facts submitted to it by the lower court.\n\nIf the application is granted, the matter is referred to the higher court. This usually takes the form \"were we/was I correct to ...\" and then the specified aspect of law to which the appeal relates. If the application to state a case is refused, the applicant may be able to seek redress by judicial review. The higher court will determine whether or not the law was correctly applied. If the appeal is upheld, the higher court will refer the case back to the referring court with directions to correct its decision. Otherwise, the appeal would be dismissed.\n"}

The law varies from limited film and electronic media coverage in some countries, to a complete ban in others.\n\nIn the US, photography and broadcasting is permitted in some courtrooms but not in others. Some argue that use of media during courtroom proceedings presents a mockery of the judicial system, though the issue has been contested at length. The presence of cameras can create fallacious information that can damage the reputation for the courts and the trust from the public and/or viewers observing the televised proceedings. Many famous trials, such as the O.J. Simpson murder trial, were televised. In the wake of the O.J. trial, however, many judges decided to ban cameras from their courtrooms. Immediately after that trial, California Governor Pete Wilson announced his opposition to televised trials, and he later asked the Judicial Council to consider reinstituting the ban on film and electronic media coverage of criminal trials. It has been argued, however, that the Simpson case was an anomaly that has little relation to the everyday concerns of media coverage of the criminal justice system.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 53 states, \"Except as otherwise provided by a statute or these rules, the court must not permit the taking of photographs in the courtroom during judicial proceedings or the broadcasting of judicial proceedings from the courtroom.\" However, some federal courtrooms experimented with cameras from 1991 to 1994. The courts have thus far been unwilling to overturn the ban on cameras, citing \"concerns with expenditure of judicial time on administration and oversight of broadcasting; the necessity of sequestering juries so that they will not look at the television program of the trial itself; the difficulty in empaneling an impartial jury in the case of a retrial; the necessity of larger jury panels or increased use of marshals; the psychological effects on witnesses, jurors, lawyers, and judges; and related considerations of 'solemnity,' 'dignity,' and the like.\" In 1996, Justice David Souter said, \"The day you see a camera come into our courtroom it’s going to roll over my\ndead body.\" U.S. Senator Arlen Specter has proposed televising U.S. Supreme Court proceedings. The Sunshine in the Courtroom Act, introduced by Charles Grassley, would \"authorize the presiding judge of a U.S. appellate court or U.S. district court to permit the photographing, electronic recording, broadcasting, or televising to the public of court proceedings over which that judge presides.\" The Senate Judiciary Committee has recommended that it be considered by the Senate as a whole.\n\nIn 1965, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, \"The television industry, like other institutions, has a proper area of activities and limitations beyond which it cannot go with its cameras. That area does not extend into an American courtroom. On entering that hallowed sanctuary, where the lives, liberty and property of people are in jeopardy, television representatives have only the rights of the general public, namely, to be present, to observe the proceedings, and thereafter, if they choose, to report them.\" In the 1981 case \"Chandler v. Florida\", the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that televising trials does not, per se, violate due process. Although the U.S. Constitution contains a public trial clause, it has been argued that the requirement of a public trial was created and satisfied when there were no broadcasters or telecasters and few newspapers. In some cases, jury deliberations have been publicly broadcast.\n\nPhotography and broadcasting of a Crown Court case in the United Kingdom has been illegal since 1925 per code 41 of the Criminal Justice Act and the Contempt of Court Act. In 2004, a small number of cases in the Court of Appeal were filmed in a trial basis. Other courts have begun to allow photography and filming in the early 21st century; the Supreme Court has permitted filming since 2009 while the Court of Appeal has allowed it on a regular basis since 2013.\n\nSome disadvantages of televised trials, from the point of view of the media, are that the proceedings are static visually, consume large amounts of TV crew time, and are sometimes difficult for the viewers to understand.\n\nDaniel M. Kolkey argues that televising trials can distort the truth-seeking process of a criminal trial and chill witnesses' willingness to cooperate; that televising trials interferes with the privacy of victims, witnesses and defendants; that the decision whether to televise trials does not lend itself to a case-by-case determination; and that televising trials can transform them into a form of entertainment which can undermine the dignity of, and respect for, our judicial institutions. Bryan Goebel counter-argues that there is no evidence to support claims that cameras have any greater psychological effect than a packed courtroom of strangers or that the cameras undermine truthful testimony. It has been pointed out that inasmuch as no trial can be reproduced in laboratory conditions, scientific experimentation is not possible, and we thus have no empirical data on the effect of television on a criminal trial.\n\nIt has been argued that because the majority of Americans have had no personal experience with the legal system, and because the majority of Americans get their information about the world solely from television, the portrayal of justice on television is extremely important to the continued viability of the legal system and to the individual's understanding of that system. Senator Charles Schumer argued, \"Courts are an important part of our government, and the more our government institutions are shown to the public, the more dignified they become, and the more the public comes to understand them. Allowing cameras into our courtrooms will help demystify them and let the public evaluate how well the system works.\" Justice Otto Moore of the Colorado Supreme Court opined in 1956, \"Do we hear complaints that the employment of these modern devices of thought transmission in the pulpits of our great churches destroys the dignity of the service; that they degrade the pulpit or create misconceptions in the mind of the public? The answers are obvious. That which is carried out with dignity will not become undignified because more people may be permitted to see and hear.\" William O. Douglas argued that televising trials should not be allowed because the press can use it to pressure judges to decide a case a certain way, particularly in jurisdictions where judges are elected.\n\nIn reference to the argument that cameras make witnesses nervous, former jurist Louis Gohmert stated, \"I think nervousness is a good thing in a witness. It makes potential inaccuracies come to the light and easier to observe.\" He responded to the argument that cameras may make witnesses more reluctant to testify by saying, \"There is a thing called a subpoena,\" and noting that he \"found that if people are not willing to come to court and they are reluctant to testify, officers with handcuffs and guns are very helpful.\"\n\n"}

She was the third of five children. She attended La Retraite Convent School on Alderney and then Bristol University, where she studied English. At the age of 22 she married draughtsman Philip Roy Bennett (1907–1986), converting from the Church of England to Roman Catholicism in order to do so. The marriage lasted six years; the couple separated in 1946, a year after the birth of their only child Simon Bennett. Following the divorce, Bennett moved in with her former mother-in-law and raised her son Simon.\n\nIn 1954, Bennett enrolled at the Institute of Archaeology in London (now part of University College London) to study for a postgraduate diploma in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces in the West. She participated in excavations led by Sheppard Frere, and directed two excavations of her own: a Roman villa near Cox Green, Berkshire; and a Romano-British temple near her home in Bruton, Somerset. She then took a second postgraduate diploma in Palestinian Archaeology, which she studied under Kathleen Kenyon.\n\nAfter completing her second postgraduate diploma, Bennett was invited to join Kenyon's final season of excavations at Jericho in 1957–58, and subsequently contributed to the second volume of Kenyon's monograph on the site. She then went on to work with Peter Parr at Petra (1958–1963), and again with Kenyon in Jerusalem (1961–1963).\n\nIt was whilst working with Parr at Petra that Bennett first became interested in the Edomites, which was to become the focus of her later career. She conducted excavations at an Edomite site in Petra in 1958, 1960 and 1963. It was here that Bennett also began her reputation for overcoming considerable logistical obstacles: the site was located atop one of Petra's most inaccessible peaks, \"Umm al-Biyara\", and all supplies had to be carried up to the summit by hand or else airlifted in by helicopter. Bennett's work there significantly revised the previously accepted chronology of the Edamites, placing them in the 7th century BCE rather than the 13th. She subsequently excavated the Edomite sites of Tawilan (1968–70, 1982), near Petra, where Bennett discovered the first cuneiform tablet found in Jordan; Buseirah in southern Jordan (1971–74, 1980), identified with the biblical Bozrah, the capital of the Edomite kingdom; and a number of mining sites around Wadi Dana and Wadi Faynan.\n"}

Boorstin\n\nDaniel Joseph Boorstin (October 1, 1914 – February 28, 2004) was an American historian at the University of Chicago who wrote on many topics in American and world history. He was appointed the twelfth Librarian of the United States Congress in 1975 and served until 1987. He was instrumental in the creation of the Center for the Book at the Library of Congress.\n\nRepudiating his youthful membership in the Communist Party while a Harvard undergraduate (1938–39), Boorstin became a political conservative and a prominent exponent of consensus history. He argued in \"The Genius of American Politics\" (1953) that ideology, propaganda, and political theory are foreign to America. His writings were often linked with such historians as Richard Hofstadter, Louis Hartz and Clinton Rossiter as a proponent of the \"consensus school\", which emphasized the unity of the American people and downplayed class and social conflict. Boorstin especially praised inventors and entrepreneurs as central to the American success story.\n\nBoorstin was born in 1914, in Atlanta, Georgia, into a Jewish family. His father, Samuel, was a lawyer who participated in the defense of Leo Frank, a Jewish factory superintendent who was accused of the rape and murder of a teenage girl. After Frank's 1915 lynching led to a surge of anti-Semitic sentiment in Georgia, the family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where Boorstin was raised. He graduated from Tulsa's Central High School in 1930, at the age of 15. Although Samuel wanted his son to go to the University of Oklahoma, become an attorney and join his own law firm, Daniel wanted to go to Harvard Law School. He graduated with highest honors (\"summa cum laude\") from Harvard in 1937, studied at Balliol College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, receiving BA and BCL degrees. The American National Biography Online states that he joined the Communist Party in 1938, then left it in 1939, when Russia and Germany invaded Poland. In 1940, he earned a SJD degree at Yale University. He was hired as an assistant professor at Swarthmore College in 1942, where he stayed for two years. In 1944, he became a professor at the University of Chicago for 25 years and was the Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions at the University of Cambridge in 1964. He served as director and senior historian of the National Museum of History and Technology of the Smithsonian Institution (now known as the National Museum of American History, Behring Center) from 1973 to 1975. President Gerald Ford nominated Boorstin to be Librarian of Congress, in 1975.\n\nOn April 9, 1941, he married a Wellesley College graduate, Ruth Carolyn Frankel (1917–2013). She quickly became his partner and editor for his first book, \"The Mysterious Science of the Law\", published in the same year. Boorstin, with Ruth as his collaborator, wrote more than 20 books, including two major trilogies, one on the American experience and the other on world intellectual history. \"\", the final book in the first trilogy, received the 1974 Pulitzer Prize in history. Boorstin's second trilogy, \"The Discoverers\", \"The Creators\" and \"The Seekers,\" examines the scientific, artistic and philosophic histories of humanity, respectively.

Boorstin Reader\" (Modern Library, 1995), he wrote, “Essential to my life and work as a writer was my marriage in 1941 to Ruth Frankel who has ever since been my companion and editor for all my books.” Her obituary in \"The Washington Post\" (December 6, 2013) quotes Boorstin as saying, “Without her, I think my works would have been twice as long and half as readable.”\n\nWithin the discipline of social theory, Boorstin's 1961 book \"The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-events in America\" is an early description of aspects of American life that were later termed hyperreality and postmodernity. In \"The Image\", Boorstin describes shifts in American culture – mainly due to advertising – where the reproduction or simulation of an event becomes more important or \"real\" than the event itself. He goes on to coin the term pseudo-event, which describes events or activities that serve little to no purpose other than to be reproduced through advertisements or other forms of publicity. This book also describes what many today call \"fake news\". The idea of pseudo-events anticipates later work by Jean Baudrillard and Guy Debord. The work is an often used text in American sociology courses, and Boorstin's concerns about the social effects of technology remain influential.\n\nBoorstin has been credited with saying, \"“Ideas need no passports from their place of origin, nor visas for the countries they enter…. We, the librarians of the world, are servants of an indivisible world… Books and ideas make a boundless world.”\n\nWhen President Ford nominated Boorstin to be Librarian of Congress in 1975, the nomination was supported by the Authors Guild but opposed by liberals, who objected to his perceived conservatism and his opposition to the social revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was attacked by the American Library Association because Boorstin \"was not a library administrator\". The Senate confirmed the nomination without debate.\n\nBoorstin retired in 1987, saying that he wanted to do full-time writing. He died of pneumonia February 28, 2004, in Washington D. C. He was survived by Ruth, his three sons, Paul, Jonathan and David, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. David Levy, a history professor at the University of Oklahoma, said in one of his lectures after Boorstin's death: “One can only imagine what he might have achieved, if he had only listened to his father’s advice about where to go to college.”\n\nProfessor Levy delivered a lecture about Boorstin in April 2014 at an Oklahoma University event, the President’s Day of Learning. He had several observations about Boorstin's approach to American history that seem to explain why many contemporary historians opposed his appointment to head the Library of Congress. According to Levy:\n\nJohn Y. Cole, in the obituary of Boorstin he wrote for the American Antiquarian, credited Boorstin with bringing new intellectual energy to the Library of Congress (LOC), opening the institution to, \"the public, to scholars, and to new constituencies. In 1976, he held a press conference to announce that he had discovered the contents of President Lincoln's pockets when he was assassinated in 1865. They had been in a wall safe in the Librarian's office. He had these artifacts put on public display, where they have become the most popular attraction for by tourists visiting the 'American Treasures of the Library of Congress' exhibition in the Library's Jefferson Building. He was instrumental in creating the American Folklife Center in 1976, and the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress in 1977. In 1979, the LOC and the Kennedy Center opened a Performing Arts Library in the Kennedy Center. In 1980, he set up the Council of Scholars, a new link between the LOC and the world of scholarship. Another major event during Boorstin's tenure at was the construction and implementation of LOC's James Madison Memorial Building during 1980 - 1982. He obtained private contributions to open the Mary Pickford Theater in the Madison Building in 1983. The theater was intended to increase public awareness of the LOC's large collection of motion pictures.\n\nIn 1984, Boorstin and Architect of the Capitol George White teamed up to persuade Congress to appropriate $81.5 million for rehabilitating two of the LOC's older structures, the Jefferson (1897) and Adams (1939) Buildings. In 1986, Boorstin appeared before Congress to oppose legislation that would have made drastic cuts in the LOC budget. His pleas resulted in substantially restoring the proposed cuts. It also resulted in his being called, \"...an intellectual Paul Revere.\"\n\nOverall, Boorstin proved so persuasive that the Federal appropriation increased from $116 million to more than $250 million during his administration.\n\nHis book, \"The Americans: The Colonial Experience (1958)\" won the Bancroft Prize for best book in history. The Society of American Historians awarded Boorstin the Francis Parkman Prize for \"The Americans: The National Experience (1965)\". Boorstin was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, First Class, by the Japanese government in 1986. He was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for writing \"The Americans: The Democratic Experience\" (1973). He was inducted into the Tulsa Hall of Fame in 1989, and received the Oklahoma Book Award in 1993 for \"The Creators\".\n\nHe held twenty honorary degrees, including an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Tulsa and Doctor of Letters from Oglethorpe University in 1994.\n\n\n\n"}

The dedication has its own place on the \"dedication page\" and is part of the front matter.\n\nIn newer books, the dedication is located on a \"dedication page\" on its own, usually on the recto page after the main title page inside the front matter. It can occupy one or multiple lines depending on its importance. It can also be \"in a longer version as a dedication letter or dedication preface at the book's beginning\". Nowadays, the dedication's function is mainly part of the self-portrayal of the author in front of his or her readers.\n\nEvidence of dedications is provided back into the Classical antiquity. Besides the wish to express their gratitude towards a certain person, the authors often had also other reasons to dedicate their work to a particular person. Well into the 18th century, it was not usual for publishers to remunerate the authors; authors tended to be paid or remunerated as one element of a patron-client relationship, in which the author-client paid tribute, in the dedication, to his or her patron. A typical writer dedicated \"their book to a high standing personality -- to Fürsts or bishops -- or to a city and tried to gain some money through this practice\".\n\nIn many cases the petitioner was lucky and received a gift from the patron. In some cases, the writer groveled before the patron and a formal dedication \"contained often a very elaborate and submissive affection\". In some cases not only the authors tried to get some money, but also the printers tried through dedications to cover a part of their costs.\n\nA book dedication can provide a fascinating glimpse into the life and times of the author. For example, Lord Byron (1788–1824) engaged in a famous feud with Robert Southey, who was then England's Poet Laureate. Byron wrote a mocking 17-verse dedication to his epic poem \"Don Juan\" in which he savagely pilloried Southey as a dull, reactionary \"warbler\" who had abandoned his political principles for favor and financial reward.\n\nThroughout time, book dedications were used to make political statements or to condemn war and inequality. Author Toni Morrison dedicated \"Beloved\", her 1987 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about a fugitive slave who killed her daughter, to \"Sixty Million and more.\"\n\nFurthermore, book dedications reflect the tastes and mores of society. Whereas many Elizabethan dedications were erudite and witty, some modern authors have abandoned literary pretense, sometimes using profanity to shock or amuse their audiences.\n\nThe dedication is not to be confounded with the handwritten dedication of a single copy: the presentation copy.\n\n\n"}

In 1515, the Spanish transported the entire population to Hispaniola to work in the copper mines; most were allowed to return when the mines were tapped out. The Dutch, who took control a century later, left the Arawaks to graze livestock, using the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean. The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands. \n\nThe population is estimated to be 75% mixed European/Amerindian/African, 15% Black and 10% other ethnicities. The Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands, and a quite big portion of Arubans who claim their ethnicity as Dutch possess Arawak blood. Although no full-blooded Aboriginals remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic Arawak heritage. Most of the population is descended from Caquetio Indians and Dutch and to a lesser extent of Africans, Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, and Sephardic Jewish ancestors. Recently, there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting foreign workers to a maximum of three years residency on the island. Demographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela. Many of Aruba's families are descended from Venezuelan immigrants. There is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes. As Aruba has a little proximity to Colombia, Colombian residents and their children are found here. Aruba is a home of Chinese, and Indo Caribbeans and Javanese, who descend largely from workers contracted from India and the island of Java in the former Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia).\n\nThe two official languages are the Dutch language and the predominant, national language Papiamento, which is classified as a creole language.

{"id": "817445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=817445", "title": "Double act", "text": "Double act\n\nA double act, also known as a comedy duo, is a comic pairing in which humor is derived from the uneven relationship between two partners, usually of the same gender, age, ethnic origin and profession but drastically different in terms of personality or behavior. Often one of the members of the duo — the straight man, feed, dead wood, or stooge — is portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other one — the funny man, banana man or comic — is portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent, silly, or unorthodox. If the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other will often be referred to as a comic foil. The term \"feed\" comes from the way a straight man sets up jokes and then \"feeds\" them to his partner.\n\nDespite the names often given to the roles, the \"straight man\" need not be humorless and it is not always the comic who provides the act's humor. Sometimes it is the straight man who gets the laughs through his or her sarcastic reactions to the comic's antics, as was often the case with Stewart Lee's deadpan, reasoned reactions to Richard Herring's more ridiculous antics in their pairing. Where the \"straight man\" serves no specific comic purpose, but acts as a device to make the \"comic\" look good, he is known as a \"stooge\". This is sometimes considered a derogatory term, and began to fall out of use by the 1930s when The Three Stooges began identifying itself as all stooges. Most often, however, the humor in a double act comes from the way the two personalities play off each other, rather than from the individual players. In many successful acts the roles are interchangeable.\n\nThe template for the modern double act began in the British music halls and the American vaudeville scene of the late nineteenth century. Here, the \"straight man\" was a necessity, as he would repeat the lines of the \"comic\". This was done simply because the audience would be noisy, and repeating a joke gave the audience a better chance of hearing it. Soon the dynamic developed so that the \"straight man\" became a more integral part of the act, setting up jokes to which the comic could then deliver the \"punchline.\" At various stages, acts such as George Burns and Gracie Allen (who initially operated with Burns as the comic, but quickly switched roles upon recognizing Gracie's greater appeal), Abbott and Costello, Flanagan and Allen, Gallagher and Shean, and Smith and Dale were all popular draws. The dynamic continued to develop, with Abbott and Costello using a modern and recognizable formula in routines such as Who's On First? in the 1930s and Flanagan and Allen using \"cross talking\".\n\nThough vaudeville would last well into the 1930s, its popularity began to wane owing to the gradual rise of motion pictures, and some acts disappeared, having failed to survive the transition to movies. By the 1920s, double acts were beginning to attract worldwide fame more readily through the silent era. However, because of the obvious restrictions, the comedy was not derived from \"cross talk\" or clever verbal exchanges but through slapstick routines and the actions of the characters.\n\nThe first double act to gain worldwide fame through film was Laurel and Hardy. Before meeting, the pair had never worked together on stage (they did as of 1940), though both had worked in vaudeville—Stan Laurel with Charlie Chaplin as part of Fred Karno's Army and Oliver Hardy as a singer. Laurel could loosely be described as the comic, though the pair were one of the first not to fit the mold in the way that many double acts do, with both taking a fairly equal share of the laughs. The pair first worked together as a double act in the 1927 film \"Duck Soup\". The first Laurel and Hardy film was called \"Putting Pants on Philip\" though their familiar characters had not yet been established. The first film they both appeared in was \"Lucky Dog\" in 1917. Laurel and Hardy adapted well to silent films, both being skilled at slapstick, and their nonverbal interplay with each other and the audience became famous—Laurel's cry and Hardy's downtrodden glances to the camera whenever something went wrong—and were carried over to their later talkies. Indeed, they were one of the few silent acts who made a very successful transition to spoken word pictures in the 1930s, showing themselves to be equally adept at verbal wordplay.\n\nThe year 1940 saw the release of Laurel and Hardy's \"Saps at Sea\", their final film for long-term producer and collaborator Hal Roach. From here, their popularity began to decline. However, in 1940s America the double act remained a cinema draw, developing into the \"buddy movie\" genre, with 1940 seeing Abbott and Costello making the transition from stage to screen and the first of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby's \"Road to...\" series. Further acts would soon follow; for example, the first pairing of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis occurred in 1946. About the same time The Bickersons became popular on radio. Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner started their 2000 Year Old Man recordings and subsequent television appearances in 1961. The genre has continued to exist in cinema while also making a successful transition to radio and later television via The Smothers Brothers and \"Rowan and Martin's Laugh In\".\n\nIn Britain, double acts would remain confined to theatres and radio until the late 1950s, when double acts such as Morecambe and Wise and Mike and Bernie Winters slowly began the transition to television on variety programmes such as \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium\". It was not until the mid to late 1960s that these acts truly came into their own. When Morecambe and Wise teamed up with writer Eddie Braben, they began to redefine what was meant by a double act, with Wise, the straight man, being developed into a comic character in his own right. They provided the link between music hall and modern comedy for double acts. As the two leading double acts of the day, Morecambe and Wise and the Winters brothers enjoyed a playful rivalry—the Winters themselves mocked the slight edge Morecambe and Wise had over them in popularity while Morecambe, when asked what he and Wise would have been if not comedians, replied \"Mike and Bernie Winters\".\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, the traditional formula was shunned by The Two Ronnies, who completely dispensed with the need for a \"straight man\", and Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, two Oxbridge-educated comedians who used the double act to deliver satire and edgy comedy.\n\nLight entertainment in Britain in the 1970s was dominated by Morecambe and Wise, who enjoyed very impressive ratings, especially on their Christmas specials. Although Mike and Bernie Winters's popularity declined, The Two Ronnies' success grew greatly while Peter Cook and Dudley Moore sporadically produced acclaimed work, in particular their controversial recordings as Derek and Clive from 1976 to 1978.\n\nThe mid to late 1970s saw a resurgence in American double acts. \"Blazing Saddles\" (1974) featured a memorable performance between Mel Brooks and Harvey Korman (who would team up again in Brooks's 1981 follow-up \"History of the World, Part I\"). \"Saturday Night Live\", first broadcast in 1975, provided a group of comedians who were prepared to appear with each other in sketches as double acts and has continued to do so. In particular, it was here that Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi honed their characters The Blues Brothers, who would soon be propelled to fame in the 1980 buddy movie of the same name. Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor also embarked on a string of successful buddy films in the 1970s. Cheech & Chong also gained massive popularity during this time.\n\nOccasionally the straight-man/funny-man dynamic would appear in contexts unexpected and between characters not normally thought of as comics. This often appeared in the James T. Kirk (William Shatner)/Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) relationship in several episodes of the original \"Star Trek\" series.\n\nMorecambe and Wise had dominated British light entertainment throughout the 1970s, but their presence had begun to wane in the early 1980s. When Morecambe died moments after finishing a solo show in 1984 (his last words were 'I'm glad that's over'), the best-loved double act in British comedy came to an end, and several new acts emerged. However, the two distinct groups could not have been more different.\n\nIn the wake of \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\", \"The Young Ones\" and the breakthrough onto television of 'alternative comedy' came French and Saunders; Fry and Laurie; Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson; Hale and Pace; and Smith and Jones. These edgier comics were more brash and crude—comedy's answer to punk rock. They developed the satire and vulgarity of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore rather than the more gentle humour of Morecambe and Wise and The Two Ronnies. In fact, Smith and Jones showed blatant disregard for their predecessors, openly mocking the Two Ronnies (this may have been a factor in Ronnie Barker's decision to retire from comedy in the late 1980s.)\n\nThe early 1990s saw comedy become \"the new rock and roll\" in Britain and this was inherent in the work of Newman and Baddiel and Punt and Dennis on \"The Mary Whitehouse Experience\". Newman and Baddiel in particular symbolised this rock and roll attitude by playing the biggest ever British comedy gig at Wembley Arena. However, with this came tension. Newman and Baddiel fell out with Punt and Dennis, not wishing to share screen time with them, and then with each other. David Baddiel went on to form another successful double act with Frank Skinner.\n\nThe 1990s also saw the introduction of one of comedy's strangest yet most successful double acts in Reeves and Mortimer. They at the same time deconstructed light entertainment and paid homage to many of the classic double acts (Vic Reeves would even do an Eric Morecambe impression on \"Vic Reeves Big Night Out\"). They simultaneously used very bizarre, idiosyncratic humour and traditional double act staples (in later years they became increasingly reliant on violent slapstick).\n\nAnother double act who emerged in the mid to late 1990s were Lee & Herring, who combined a classic clash of personalities (downbeat and rational Lee contrasting with energetic, childish Herring) with very ironic, often satirical humour.\n\nAlso appearing in the latter half of the decade were Adam and Joe, whose low-budget, self-produced Channel 4 series \"The Adam and Joe Show\" was a very sharp combination of TV and movie parodies and satirical looks at various elements of youth culture.\n\nIndian cinema also had its share of the double act, with Tamil cinema comedians Goundamani and Senthil teaming up for several films throughout the decade, similarly Kota Srinivasa Rao and Babu Mohan in Telugu Cinema.\n\nIn Sri Lankan cinema, the famous double act is found with Sri Lanka cinema comedians Bandu Samarasinghe and Tennyson Cooray where they pioneered Sri Lankan commercial film industry in 2000s.\n\nMitchell and Webb are another successful double act from the 2000s onwards, having multiple sketch shows on both radio and TV as well as starring in the award winning sitcom Peep Show.\n\nHowever, most of the 2000s' most successful double acts take their inspiration from the odder strain of double-act comedy spearheaded by Reeves and Mortimer. Matt Lucas and David Walliams, who had previously worked with Reeves and Mortimer, also took inspiration from the Two Ronnies. The Mighty Boosh also played with the formula but essentially remained traditional at their roots. Another popular current light entertainment/presenting comedy act is Ant & Dec, who are a very basic yet effective example of a double act.\n\nIn early 2012, comedians Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele appeared in a sketch comedy TV show titled Key & Peele airing on Comedy Central. \n\nMany modern day YouTube Channels like to use this trope to their advantage. Some examples include Smosh, Dan and Phil, the Game Grumps and Rhett and Link of the YouTube channel Good Mythical Morning,\n\nIn its British form, the two actors would usually be composed of a \"straight man\" or \"feed\" and a \"comic\", the purpose of the feed being to set up jokes for the comic. This would rely heavily on comic timing.\n\nMorecambe and Wise are arguably the quintessential British double act. They followed the traditional formula with Eric Morecambe as the comic and Ernie Wise as the feed. However, other British acts such as The Two Ronnies, Hale and Pace, Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, Reeves and Mortimer, French and Saunders, Mitchell and Webb, Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones, Fry and Laurie, Lee and Herring, Armstrong and Miller, Peacock and Gamble, the role of \"comic\" and \"straight man\" are less obvious, largely interchangeable or dispensed with altogether. More obvious British examples of the comic-feed dynamic are Cannon and Ball, Little and Large or the children's entertainers The Chuckle Brothers, where the straight man acted largely as a humourless set up for the comic.\nPeter Cook and Dudley Moore perhaps also deserve a mention as being the first double act to go against the grain, and turn their double act into a complex analysis of the two's relationship. In many of the sketches (especially the Pete and Dud exchanges) Cook played the domineering know-it-all (who knows nothing) and Moore the put-upon dimwit (who also knows nothing).\n\nThis dominance was accentuated by the difference in height between the two, and the speed of Cook's mind, which meant that he could ad-lib, and force Moore to corpse in a Pete and Dud dialogue, leaving him helpless to respond. As the partnership progressed into the often-improvised Derek and Clive dialogues, these light-hearted attempts to make Moore laugh became, as a result of Cook's growing insecurity and alcoholism, aggressive attacks on the defenceless Moore. However, carrying on the tradition of going against the grain of traditional double acts, when the partnership dissolved in the late 1970s, it was Cook whose career stalled due to boredom, alcoholism and lack of ambition, while Moore went on to become one of Hollywood's most unlikely leading men.\n\nThe double act has also become a popular theme in British sitcoms. One of the earliest examples of this was the relationship between Tony Hancock and Sid James in the Galton and Simpson series \"Hancock's Half Hour\". James played a down-to-earth character while Hancock was pompous and had delusions of grandeur, and the comedy was derived from the two playing off each other's characteristics.\n\nA common trend in sitcoms is to place the double act in a situation where they are forced together through uncontrollable circumstance. In another Galton and Simpson production, \"Steptoe and Son\", a son, with great ambition, was forced to live with his elderly, manipulative father as a rag and bone man. The comedy derives from the way the characters interact in their tempestuous relationship. The series also has more heart-rending moments as the son despairs at his inability to escape his needy, selfish, grasping father.\n\n\"Porridge\" saw \"an habitual criminal\", Fletcher (played by Ronnie Barker, already famous for his comedy partnership with Ronnie Corbett) and a young, naive, first-time prisoner, Lennie Godber. The two would bicker but endured a relationship of mutual respect. Barker also formed a partnership with David Jason in Open All Hours, with Jason playing Granville while Barker played Albert Arkwright. Many don't see this as a comedy duo, but the straight-man element coupled with Barker's funny-man antics on the show are still compressed into the script.\n\nRik Mayall and Ade Edmondson combined their success in sitcoms (\"The Young Ones\") and as a double act (The Dangerous Brothers) in 1991 when they created \"Bottom\". Their characters are a pair of sad, pathetic losers forced together by their mutual hopelessness. However, unlike earlier examples of such, the characters in \"Bottom\" absolutely hate each other, exacerbating their despair. This often leads to slapstick violence, such as hitting each other with frying pans. Mayall and Edmonson have said \"Bottom\" aimed to be more than just a series of toilet gags—it was meant to be a cruder cousin to plays like \"Waiting for Godot\" about the pointlessness of life.\n\nOther popular double acts in British sitcoms include complex relationships involving status and superiority themes: in \"Dad's Army\", the social climbing envy of Captain George Mainwaring, to his right-hand man (Sergeant Arthur Wilson) who is of higher status than him; and in Red Dwarf, the working class everyman Dave Lister to the middle class but socially-awkward Arnold Rimmer. However, the most prominent double act is that of an intelligent person and his inferior sidekick, such as Basil and Manuel of \"Fawlty Towers\", Blackadder and Baldrick of \"Blackadder\", or Ted and Father Dougal of the Irish sitcom \"Father Ted\".\n\nIn recent years, double acts as sitcoms appear to have gone full circle, as illustrated by the cult success of \"The Mighty Boosh\". For the relationship between the two main characters this series uses a formula very similar to that between Sid and Tony in \"Hancock's Half Hour\" – that of a pompous character whose best friend can see right through him and brings him back down to earth. A similar dynamic is used in \"Peep Show\" in which the characters of Mitchell and Webb were adapted for the sitcom formula. However, in this case both characters suffer from pomposity; the difference between the pair is the laidback, cool arrogance (yet stupidity) of Jeremy and the intellectual arrogance (yet social-awkwardness) of Mark.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the tradition was more popular in the earlier part of the 20th century with vaudeville-derived acts such as Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Burns and Allen, and Wheeler & Woolsey, and continuing into the television age with Martin and Lewis, Kenan & Kel, Bob and Ray, the Smothers Brothers, Wayne and Shuster, Allen and Rossi, Jack Burns and Avery Schreiber, Rowan and Martin, Mike Nichols and Elaine May, the Wayans Brothers, Troy and Abed from \"Community\", Shawn and Gus in \"Psych\" and Dwight Schrute and Jim Halpert in \"The Office\". The series \"I Love Lucy\" was known for its double acts, and Lucille Ball served as foil to both her husband Desi Arnaz and to Vivian Vance; Vance could also serve as foil to William Frawley when the situation required it.\n\nMore recently, the idea has been largely supplanted by that of the \"buddy movie\" genre, which has introduced several notable comedy partnerships not formally billed as a single \"act\" in the traditional manner. The earliest example of such a team may have been Bob Hope and Bing Crosby; later examples include Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, Mike Myers and Dana Carvey, David Spade and Chris Farley and child stars Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell. Based on the gag-man/straight-man concept, \"Stoner\" duos like Cheech and Chong, Jay & Silent Bob, and Harold and Kumar have also proven quite popular with audiences.\n\nThe double act format can also be used in presenting noncomedic information in an entertaining manner, such as Savage/Hyneman pair of the Discovery Channel's \"MythBusters\". From 2006 to 2010, Apple used the double-act formula successfully in its popular series of \"I'm a Mac/And I'm a PC\" ads with John Hodgman and Justin Long.\n\nIn China, xiangsheng (also known as crosstalk) is a traditional comedic performance usually in the form of a dialogue between two performers.\n\nIn Japan the manzai tradition parallels that of the double although it is more formulaic. Here there is a distinguished straight man (\"tsukkomi\") and funny man (\"boke\") and the humor consists of quick jokes full of slapstick humor and social misunderstandings.\n\nIn Germany Tünnes and Schäl (since 1803/1850s), two Cologne puppet theater characters, fit to the concept of fool and straight man.\n\nDuring the Second World War Tran and Helle appeared in a number of short films to deter Germans from actions detrimental to Germany's war effort or security.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1980, the most popular comedy duo of East Germany, Herricht & Preil, ran a very successful double act, with Hans-Joachim Preil as the straight man and Rolf Herricht as the comic.\n\nDouble acts who do not use the \"Straight Man/Funny Man\" dynamic or whose roles are interchangeable — as well as notable examples:\n"}

Following the launch of EU Centres of Excellence in the US and Canada in 1998, there are now 37 Centres located in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States.\n\nThe Singapore Centre, the first in Southeast Asia, opened in June 2008. It is a partnership between the European Commission, the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and the thinktank, Singapore Institute of International Affairs. Its aim is to promote knowledge of the European Union and its policies. It organises speaker events, discussions and exhibitions; publishes books, papers and teaching materials; and sends staff to visit schools and colleges in Singapore.\n\nThe Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) establishing the Centre was signed by the then EU Commissioner for Information Society and Media, Viviane Reding, with two local partners, National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University on 20 June 2008. The Centre in Singapore is the first located in Southeast Asia. According to a joint press release by the Delegation of the European Union to Singapore, that is the EU's diplomatic representation in Singapore, and the Centre's other stakeholders, the three way partnership is between the European Commission, and “two leading universities, both in the region and the world, with extensive networks both across Europe and throughout Asia\".\n\nThe EU Centre has received another 3-year grant (2013-2015) to continue its mission to promote knowledge of the EU and its policies and raise the visibility of the EU in Singapore. A new partner, the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA), the oldest think tank in Singapore, is now part of the consortium. The Director of the Centre is Dr Yeo Lay Hwee\n\nThe EU Centre has been cited by Finnlink magazine as a Centre intended to “raise awareness of the longstanding partnership between the EU and Singapore, and the EU and ASEAN, and promote knowledge and visibility of the EU in Singapore through different outreach activities, education, research and publications… the Centre’s objective is to raise awareness of the EU to a local and regional audience, foster a finer understanding of the EU and its member states, and analyze EU policies and their positions on global issues”.\n\nThe EU Centre's activities revolve around outreach, education and research. The Centre, like other centres and institutes co-funded by the EU, organises lectures, workshops and seminars year round. The events have attracted speakers who are senior policy decision makers, such as Klaus Regling, former Director General of Ecofin and now the Managing Director of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), who spoke on “The Euro After 10 Years” in a distinguished lecture co-hosted by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and European Chamber of Commerce. The Centre held an academic conference on 6‐8 Dec 2009 Networked versus Institutional Regionalism\", where Professor Tommy Koh delivered the keynote speech.Its outreach event mass, the \"Green Innovations Symposium\" was featured in media. Its \"Corporate Social Responsibility Business Schools Debate\" drew a 700 strong audience and was moderated by Ms Claire Chiang, Chairperson of Banyan Tree Global Foundation, the CSR arm of Banyan Tree Holdings. The EU Centre regularly partners research institutions and think tanks such as Asia-Europe Foundation to host events such as a public talk by Alain Ruche, Deputy Head of Unit, External Relations Directorate-General, European Commission. and collaborates with others in research, such as in “The EU through the Eyes of Asia” project of the National Centre for Research on Europe (NCRE), University of Canterbury.\n\nDuring its first grant period from 2008 - 2012, the Centre organised more than 100 public events ranging from lectures, talks, seminars and panel discussions. It also organised several competitions to reach out to younger Singaporeans and Southeast Asians.\n\nIn support of the official Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process and the 9th ASEM Summit to be held in Vientiane, the EU Centre teamed up with the Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF) and National Library Board (NLB) to put together an Exhibition entitled “Connected Histories, Shared Future” showcasing the work done by ASEF and EU Centre to bring about greater connections and exchanges between Asia and Europe.\n\nThe Exhibition was inaugurated at the National Library Building in Singapore by Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister of Singapore from 1991 – 2004) on 17 May 2012. The Exhibition was on displayed for a month at the Main Central Library of the NLB before travelling to four other locations in Singapore – to the Jurong Regional Library, Woodlands Regional Library, NTU Lee Wee Nam Library and NUS Central Library each for 3–4 weeks. As the centrepiece and final destination for 2012, the Exhibition was brought to Vientiane, Laos in November 2012 and set up at the National Convention Centre, where 51 leaders from Asia and Europe were convening for the 9th ASEM Summit. The Exhibition was also viewed by the ASEM senior officials prior to the Leaders meeting.\n\nThe EU Centre sees publications as an important avenue not only to share research findings, build up knowledge on the EU and generate further discussions and debates on issues, but also as an important outreach tool. The EU Centre publishes working papers targeted at the academic community to encourage exploration and discussion of various subjects pertinent to the EU and Southeast Asia, and also a series of background and policy briefs aimed at the policy makers and the broader public to explain the background to some of the EU’s policies, and to discuss their relevance for Singapore or the region. \nOur latest publication is a book containing a collection of essays by European and Asian scholars, policy makers, journalists and young researchers entitled \"Changing Tides and Changing Ties - Anchoring Asia-Europe Relations in Challenging Times\".\n\nStaff and Associates of the EU Centre visited some 30 pre-university institutions, mostly Junior College and Integrated Programme schools, to bring the European Union and its global relevance to the students, as well as raise the level of interest in European Studies.\n\nThe Centre also published three Resource packages for teachers to explain the role of the EU in global trade, its role in conflict management and also to explain monetary integration and the crisis in the Eurozone.\n\n"}
{"id": "205534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205534", "title": "Editorial cartoon", "text": "Editorial cartoon\n\nAn editorial cartoon, also known as a political cartoon, is a drawing containing a commentary expressing the artist's opinion. An artist who writes and draws such images is known as an editorial cartoonist. They typically combine artistic skill, hyperbole and satire in order to question authority and draw attention to corruption, political violence and other social ills.\n\nDeveloped in England in the latter part of the 18th century, James Gillray was a pioneer of the political cartoon. Founded in 1841, the British periodical \"Punch\" appropriated the term cartoon to refer to its political cartoons, which led to the term's widespread use.\n\nThe pictorial satire has been credited as the precursor to the political cartoons in England: John J. Richetti, in \"The Cambridge history of English literature, 1660–1780\", states that \"English graphic satire really begins with Hogarth's \"Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme\"\". William Hogarth’s pictures combined social criticism with sequential artistic scenes. A frequent target of his satire was the corruption of early 18thcentury British politics. An early satirical work was an \"Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme\" (c.1721), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 known as the South Sea Bubble, in which many English people lost a great deal of money.\n\nHis art often had a strong moralizing element to it, such as in his masterpiece of 1732–33, \"A Rake's Progress\", engraved in 1734. It consisted of eight pictures that depicted the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant, who spends all of his money on luxurious living, services from sex workers, and gambling—the character's life ultimately ends in Bethlem Royal Hospital.\n\nHowever, his work was only tangentially politicized and was primarily regarded on its artistic merits. George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.\n\nThe medium began to develop in England in the latter part of the 18th century—especially around the time of the French Revolution—under the direction of its great exponents, James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and caricature, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon. Calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account, many of Gillray's satires were directed against George III, depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of Revolutionary France and Napoleon. The times in which Gillray lived were peculiarly favourable to the growth of a great school of caricature. Party warfare was carried on with great vigour and not a little bitterness; and personalities were freely indulged in on both sides. Gillray's incomparable wit and humour, knowledge of life, fertility of resource, keen sense of the ludicrous, and beauty of execution, at once gave him the first place among caricaturists.\n\nGeorge Cruikshank became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray (1820s–40s). His early career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications. He gained notoriety with his political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians and was bribed in 1820 \"not to caricature His Majesty\" (George IV) \"in any immoral situation\". His work included a personification of England named John Bull who was developed from about 1790 in conjunction with other British satirical artists such as Gillray and Rowlandson.\n\nThe art of the editorial cartoon was further developed with the publication of the British periodical \"Punch\" in 1841, founded by Henry Mayhew and engraver Ebenezer Landells (an earlier magazine that published cartoons was \"Monthly Sheet of Caricatures\", printed from 1830 and an important influence on \"Punch\"). It was bought by Bradbury and Evans in 1842, who capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies to turn the magazine into a preeminent national institution. The term \"cartoon\" to refer to comic drawings was coined by the magazine in 1843; the Houses of Parliament were to be decorated with murals, and \"carttons\" for the mural were displayed for the public; the term \"cartoon\" then meant a finished preliminary sketch on a large piece of cardboard, or in Italian. \"Punch\" humorously appropriated the term to refer to its political cartoons, and the popularity of the \"Punch\" cartoons led to the term's widespread use.\n\nArtists who published in \"Punch\" during the 1840s and 50s included John Leech, Richard Doyle, John Tenniel and Charles Keene. This group became known as \"The \"Punch\" Brotherhood\", which also included Charles Dickens who joined Bradbury and Evans after leaving Chapman and Hall in 1843. \"Punch\" authors and artists also contributed to another Bradbury and Evans literary magazine called \"Once A Week\" (est.1859), created in response to Dickens' departure from \"Household Words\".\n\nThe most prolific and influential cartoonist of the 1850s and 60s was John Tenniel, chief cartoon artist for \"Punch\", who perfected the art of physical caricature and representation to a point that has changed little up to the present day. For over five decades he was a steadfast social witness to the sweeping national changes that occurred during this period alongside his fellow cartoonist John Leech. The magazine loyally captured the general public mood; in 1857, following the Indian Rebellion and the public outrage that followed, \"Punch\" published vengeful illustrations such as Tenniel's \"Justice\" and \"The British Lion's Vengeance on the Bengal Tiger\".\n\nBy the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many countries featured cartoons designed to express the publisher's opinion on the politics of the day. One of the most successful was Thomas Nast in New York City, who imported realistic German drawing techniques to major political issues in the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Nast was most famous for his 160 editorial cartoons attacking the criminal characteristics of Boss Tweed's political machine in New York City. Albert Boime argues that:\n\nAs a political cartoonist, Thomas Nast wielded more influence than any other artist of the 19th century. He not only enthralled a vast audience with boldness and wit, but swayed it time and again to his personal position on the strength of his visual imagination. Both Lincoln and Grant acknowledged his effectiveness in their behalf, and as a crusading civil reformer he helped destroy the corrupt Tweed Ring that swindled New York City of millions of dollars. Indeed, his impact on American public life was formidable enough to profoundly affect the outcome of every presidential election during the period 1864 to 1884.\n\nNotable editorial cartoons include Benjamin Franklin's \"Join, or Die\" (1754), on the need for unity in the American colonies; \"The Thinkers Club\" (1819), a response to the surveillance and censorship of universities in Germany under the Carlsbad Decrees; and E. H. Shepard's \"The Goose-Step\" (1936), on the rearmament of Germany under Hitler. \"The Goose-Step\" is one of a number of notable cartoons first published in the British \"Punch\" magazine.\n\nInstitutions which archive and document editorial cartoons include the Center for the Study of Political Graphics in the United States, and the British Cartoon Archive in the United Kingdom.\n\nEditorial cartoons and editorial cartoonists are recognised by a number of awards, for example the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning (for US cartoonists, since 1922) and the British Press Awards' \"Cartoonist of the Year\".\n\nPolitical cartoons can usually be found on the editorial page of many newspapers, although a few (such as Garry Trudeau's \"Doonesbury\") are sometimes placed on the regular comic strip page. Most cartoonists use visual metaphors and caricatures to address complicated political situations, and thus sum up a current event with a humorous or emotional picture.\n\nYaakov Kirschen, creator of the Israeli comic strip \"Dry Bones\", says his cartoons are designed to make people laugh, which makes them drop their guard and see things the way he does. In an interview, he defined his objective as a cartoonist as an attempt to \"seduce rather than to offend.\" \n\nModern political cartooning can be built around traditional visual metaphors and symbols such as Uncle Sam, the Democratic donkey and the Republican elephant. One alternative approach is to emphasize the text or the story line, as seen in \"Doonesbury\" which tells a linear story in comic strip format. \n\nCartoons have a great potential to political communication capable of enhancing political comprehension and reconceptualization of events, through speciﬁc frames of understanding (Mateus, 2016). Mateus' analysis \"seems to indicate that the double standard thesis can be actually applied to trans-national contexts. This means that the framing of politics and business may not be limited to one country but may reﬂect a political world-view occurring in contemporary societies. From the double standard standpoint, there are no fundamental differences in the way Canadian political cartoonists and Portuguese political cartoons assess politics and business life\" (Mateus, 2016:216). The paper does not tell that all political cartoons are based on this kind of double standard, but suggests that the double standard thesis in Political Cartoons may be a frequent frame among possible others.\n\nA political cartoon commonly draws on two unrelated events and brings them together incongruously for humorous effect. The humour can reduce people's political anger and so serves a useful purpose. Such a cartoon also reflects real life and politics, where a deal is often done on unrelated proposals beyond public scrutiny.\n\nA pocket cartoon is a form of cartoon which generally consists of a topical political gag/joke and appears as a single-panel single-column drawing. It was introduced by Osbert Lancaster in 1939 at the \"Daily Express\". A 2005 obituary by \"The Guardian\" of its pocket cartoonist David Austin said \"Newspaper readers instinctively look to the pocket cartoon to reassure them that the disasters and afflictions besetting them each morning are not final. By taking a sideways look at the news and bringing out the absurd in it, the pocket cartoonist provides, if not exactly a silver lining, then at least a ray of hope.\"\n\nEditorial cartoons sometimes cause controversies. Examples include the \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy (stemming from the publication of cartoons of Muhammad) and the 2007 Bangladesh cartoon controversy.\n\nLibel lawsuits have been rare. In Britain, the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century came in 1921 when J.H. Thomas, the leader of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the British Communist Party. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of \"Black Friday\"—when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out Miners' Federation. Thomas won his lawsuit, and restored his reputation.\n\n\n\n"}

He is known for his pioneering work in Internet art, Postinternet art, and webcomics, as well as video art, conceptual art, poetry, performance art and body art, including \"artistic drinking projects.\" His work is often controversial and semi-autobiographical, with political, romantic, occult, horror and black comedy themes. Awards for Millikin's artwork include the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nTogether, Millikin and Casey Sorrow created and popularized the international animal rights holiday World Monkey Day.\n\nMillikin began drawing horror comics by age one-and-a-half, and by second grade, he was making teachers profane birthday cards showing his school burning down. As a youth, he was influenced by 1980s X-Men and Far Side comics and the video game Gorf. Millikin began posting comics and art on the internet using CompuServe in the 1980s, and began publishing on the World Wide Web as early as the fall of 1995.\n\nMillikin attended art school at Michigan State University in their Honors College. He paid his way through school by working in MSU's human anatomy lab as an embalmer and dissectionist of human cadavers. While at art school, Millikin was homeless and lived in a Buick LeSabre.\n\nIn 2002, Millikin was an editor (along with Tom Hart) and contributing artist of the online alternative comics anthology Serializer. In 2005, Millikin was one of the artists in the Clickwheel collective that published on the video iPod. Millikin has also been published by Modern Tales and Webcomics Nation, where he was one of the all-time most popular artists. Millikin is one of the few, and first, webcomic creators successful enough to make a living as an artist.\n\nHe is also known as Eric Monster Millikin.\n\nMillikin's art often includes self-portraits as well as portraits of celebrities and political figures. His work often incorporates mixed media and found objects, such as packages of candy, paper currency, and spiders. His large-scale artwork takes full advantage of the internet's formal possibilities, and has incorporated animation and winding \"infinite canvas\" designs, going beyond the limited sizes and shapes of conventional printed pages. Millikin's works range from those made almost completely of text (including calligraphy, typography, anagrams, ambigrams, free verse, and cut-up technique poetry) to those that are optical illusions or completely abstract. Millikin's artwork has been published in books, serialized in newspapers, and displayed in art museums. \n\nMillikin's artwork is often shown in galleries and museums. He is one of the artists in the \"Out of Sequence: Underrepresented Voices in American Comics\" art exhibition which has travelled to the Krannert Art Museum and The Laboratory of Art and Ideas at Belmar, and in the \"Monsters of Webcomics Virtual Gallery\" at San Francisco's Cartoon Art Museum. His artwork was included, along with Marilyn Manson and HR Giger's, in the international horror art collection \"DAMNED.\"\n\nMillikin also distributes his artwork through college newspapers, in alternative newspapers such as the \"Metro Times\", and in magazines like \"Wired\". His work is also published in major daily newspapers like \"The Detroit News\", \"Detroit Free Press\", \"The Courier-Journal\", \"The Des Moines Register\", \"The Tennessean\" and \"USA Today\".\n\nMillikin is known for his political and social activism, with his artwork often tackling controversial issues. He has championed Barack Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as \"Obamacare\". Millikin has also championed green energy, ridiculing the \"Drill, Baby, Drill Brigade\" of \"oil producers, free-market zealots and global warming deniers.\" \n\nMillikin has also used his artwork to raise money for causes like helping Hurricane Katrina victims, fighting diseases like muscular dystrophy, and granting wishes to terminally ill children through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. He has also created posters campaigning to raise money for programs to improve adult literacy, auctioned artwork to support soup kitchen efforts to feed the hungry, and created artwork to help people in the city of Flint who had lead contaminated water during the Flint water crisis.\n\nThe American Library Association's \"Booklist\" describes how Millikin's expressionistic visual style \"crosses Edvard Munch with an incipient victim of high-school suicide\" and \"The Hindu\" describes his paintings as \"haunting images.\" In his book \",\" syndicated newspaper editorial cartoonist Ted Rall describes Millikin's work as \"one of the most interesting webcomics around.\" \"The Webcomics Examiner\" named Millikin's comics one of the best webcomics, the webcomics blog ComixTalk named it one of the 100 Greatest Webcomics of all time, and \"The Washington Post\"'s readers named it one of the top 10 finalists for Best Webcomic of the Past Decade in 2010. Millikin's work has also been nominated for multiple Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards, including their top honor of \"Outstanding Comic\". Millikin has been a panelist and guest at webcomic conventions, including the inaugural New England Webcomics Weekend, the first convention organized by and focusing on webcomic creators. The \"Sunday Times\" described serializer as \"high-art\", and the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" considered them to be the avant-garde.\nMillikin's artwork is given by Scott McCloud as an example of using the web to create \"an explosion of diverse genres and styles\" and is described as \"mind-blowing\" by Comic Book Resources. \"The Comics Journal\" has written that Millikin's comics \"use the newspaper format for far more daring, entertainingly perverse work\" than most comics and is \"perfectly at home at a good alternative weekly or a great college paper.\" \"The Webcomics Examiner\" has called Millikin's work \"one of the sharpest political commentaries available.\"\n\nMillikin's artwork has won many awards from organizations including the Associated Press, Society of Professional Journalists, Investigative Reporters and Editors, National Association of Black Journalists, and the Society for News Design. In 2008 his illustrations were part of the series \"A Mayor in Crisis\", wherein the \"Detroit Free Press\" covered, or uncovered, secret text messages of Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick to reveal the mayor's perjury and obstruction of justice in a police whistle-blower trial. The series resulted in Kilpatrick's being sent to jail and in the newspaper's 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting.\n\nHis front-page artwork in the \"Detroit Free Press\" advocating for U.S. government loans as a solution to the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2009 was described as a \"gutsy move\" that \"stretch[es] the limits of the medium\" and CNN's Kyra Phillips described it as \"full front page and in your face\". Congressman John D. Dingell displayed it on the House floor urging passage of government loans to automakers and reiterated the central theme of the piece, saying \"now is the time for us to 'Invest in America'.\"\n\nMillikin's October 2011 \"Wizard of Oz\"-themed \"Detroit Free Press\" front-page \"Lions, Tigers and Bears: Oh my!\" illustration (about the Detroit Lions, Detroit Tigers and Chicago Bears) was praised by ESPN's Mike Tirico during the Monday Night Football half time show.\n\nHowever, not all criticism of Millikin's artwork has been positive. Since 2000, Millikin has been the target of protest campaigns organized by the Catholic League for what they call his \"blasphemous treatment of Jesus\". \"[\"Fetus-X\"] is offensive to Catholics and Christians,\" Catholic League spokesman Patrick Scully said in August 2002. \"It completely ridicules the Catholic faith and is not funny.\" The \"Hartford Advocate\" has called Millikin a \"borderline sociopath.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30718783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30718783", "title": "Gangster Stories", "text": "Gangster Stories\n\nGangster Stories was a controversial pulp magazine of the early 1930s. It featured hardboiled crime fiction that glorified the gun-toting gangsters of the Prohibition era. It was published by Harold Hersey, as part of his Good Story Magazine Company pulp chain. The inaugural issue was dated November 1929; the final issue was dated November 1932. When Hersey sold his assets to another company, \"Gangster Stories\" was continued under the title \"Greater Gangster Stories\", under which it lasted through the May 1934 issue.\n\n\"Gangster Stories\" (and its companion, \"Racketeer Stories\") quickly came under censorship pressure in New York state, instigated by John S. Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, a state entity empowered to recommend obscenity cases to prosecutorial authorities. Hersey was forced to agree to abide by certain rules, e.g. not letting gangsters triumph over lawmen.\n\nThe fiction in \"Gangster Stories\" (and \"Racketeer Stories\") constitutes a unique genre. Though properly categorized as crime fiction, the emphasis was on action and gunplay. The stories only tangentially resemble the traditional detective story or mystery. A typical \"Gangster Stories\" epic featured rival mobs shooting it out in the streets with Tommy guns.\n\nPerhaps the most popular author in the magazine was Anatole Feldman, with his stories of the Chicago mobster Big Nose Serrano. Playwright Feldman initially based Serrano on the character of Cyrano de Bergerac. The first Big Nose story, \"Serrano of the Stockyards\" (\"Gangster Stories\", May 1930), roughly followed the plot and characters of the famous play. Thereafter, Serrano evolved into an unlikely crusader against the social ills of the Depression.\n\nAnother popular author was former newspaper reporter Margie Harris, a clever writer with an ear for the distinctive vernacular of the mobs. Other authors include Arthur J. Burks, former Sing Sing convict Henry Leverage, C. B. Yorke, Walt S. Dinghall, George Bruce, Richard Credicott, and D .B. McCandless.\n"}
{"id": "43330928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43330928", "title": "Glittering Images", "text": "Glittering Images\n\nGlittering Images: A Journey Through Art from Egypt to Star Wars is a 2012 book by American cultural critic Camille Paglia, in which the author discusses notable works of applied and visual art from ancient to modern times. Paglia wrote that she intended it to be a personalized \"journey\" through art history, focusing on Western works. Paglia writes that she felt inspired to write given that she worries 21st century Americans are overexposed to visual stimulation by the \"all-pervasive mass media\" and must fight to keep their capacity for contemplation.\n\nThe book features twenty-nine sections, with glossy full-color illustrations, each focused on a specific piece. Artists detailed include Titian, Manet, Picasso, and Jackson Pollock among others. After its October 16, 2012 release, the book received positive reviews from publications such as \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\", while it also picked up more critical, negative reviews from publications such as \"The New York Times Book Review\".\n\nWhile touching on the themes of Paglia's previous work, \"Glittering Images\" focuses on modern cultural ignorance. Paglia wrote what she intended as a personalized \"journey\" through art history since she believes people today have become visually overexposed by the mass-media and disconnected from the past. In it, she argues, \"the eye is assaulted, coerced, desensitized.\"\n\nPaglia discusses twenty-nine examples of visual artwork. Paglia begins by describing the ancient Egyptian funerary images of Queen Nefertari, a royal whose name means \"the most beautiful of them all\". Paglia refers to how the civilization \"dreamed of conquering the terrors of death\", and she notes how \"Egyptian painted figures float in an abstract space that is neither here nor there\", describing the visual power of this \"eternal present\" depicted. She then turns to the Cycladic statuettes carved by Bronze Age residents of several Aegean Sea islands, which feature \"coolly geometric\" designs unlike that of the voluptuous figures carved by earlier, Stone Age people (such as the 'Venus of Willendorf') while still displaying vulvae markings and prominent breasts that convey femininity. These pieces of Cycladic art are cited as \"daring explorations of form and structure\" foreshadowing the future.\n\nThe author then describes the 'Charioteer of Delphi', a work from the fifth century BC that she writes embodies well the ancient Greek ideals of \"young male beauty\" and the building of character through personal striving. She states how she finds the chariot racing athlete \"grave and dignified\" with his meditative expression, giving a \"look that would become canonical for gods and heroes in the classic tradition\". She goes on to write about the 'Porch of the Maidens' in the Erechtheion in Athens, Greece, with columns carved into feminine shapes that she labels as \"a remarkable display of female power\" as \"muscular strength\" co-exists with womanly curves, and then the piece 'Laocoön and His Sons', a violent scene carved in marble in which sea serpents attempt to slay a man and his three sons that stridently addresses the problem of theodicy.\n\nThe book goes on next to the famous mosaic of Saint John Chrysostom in the Hagia Sophia, a piece that Paglia writes as having an \"implacable intensity of gaze\" making it a great piece of Byzantine art, and additionally to the late eighth century Ireland's Book of Kells, an \"intricately decorated manuscript of the Gospels that is one of the most beautiful objects surviving from medieval Europe.\" The eight piece included is Donatello's 'Mary Magdalene', a work of the Italian Renaissance created in 1453 that showed the artist's ability to be \"harsh and imposing\". Paglia then discusses Titian's 'Venus with a Mirror'; she writes about the artistic changes it symbolizes as the strong brushwork and liberal use of paint allow for warm flesh tones, Titian creating \"opulent nudes that thrust sexual display and fantasy\" onto the viewer.\n\nPaglia next discusses Bronzino's 'Portrait of Andrea Doria as Neptune', writing that as a work of the Mannerism movement it shows a \"polished theatricality\" arresting to the viewer, and Gian Lorenzo Bernini's 'Chair of Saint Peter' in the Vatican City, a 17th-century work showing how Baroque art often \"overwhelms the senses with flamboyant grandeur\".\n\nShe takes a nuanced view of the lasting influence of pop art, writing that, generally, the artistic movement \"projects an innocent child’s view of the world.\" She also argues that works by artists such as Andy Warhol, whom she praises, conveyed powerful subtleties with their pieces. The book details 'Marilyn Diptych', a 1962 silkscreen that replicates a photo of Marilyn Monroe over and over with image variations, and the work is lauded for strongly showing the \"multiplicity of meanings\" in the actress' life and legacy.\n\nThe book additionally cites Eleanor Antin's conceptual art project '100 Boots'. Paglia praises the work, writing that \"boots, like their creator, are outsiders, eternal migrants questing for knowledge and experience.\"\n\nWriter John Adams of \"The New York Times Book Review\" published a critical review of the book, viewing it as being \"so agenda driven and so riddled with polemic asides that its potential to persuade is forever being compromised.\" Adams noted that the book avoided discussions of Giotto, Michelangelo, El Greco, Rembrandt, Vermeer, and van Gogh, which he criticized. He supported how Paglia \"encourages us to read more closely and to look more imaginatively\" at the world of art history, though concluded that her praise of George Lucas was assessing art \"by its reach rather than its depth\", and thus Paglia \"has journeyed to the wrong continent, and what she has found glittering there is fool's gold.\"\n\nJournalist Gary Rosen of \"The Wall Street Journal\", however, praised the book's \"impressive range\" and accessibility for a general audience. He argued that \"[f]or the most part, Ms. Paglia chooses well, from works both celebrated and obscure\", and he stated that the author \"is especially good at the difficult trick of providing context for the newcomer to art history without being tedious for a more experienced reader.\" In addition, \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" ran a supportive article that labeled the book a \"magisterial, poetically composed, and masterly study\".\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" published a supportive review by Michael S. Roth, an author and the president of Wesleyan University. He wrote, \"Artists, questing outsiders, are still with us, still finding their way, making their way.

Traces of colouring can still be seen on some figures. It is regarded as the finest, and best-preserved, of the \"Romanos group\" of ivories from a workshop in Constantinople, probably closely connected with the Imperial Court. \n\nThe group takes its name from the Romanos and Eudokia ivory plaque in the Cabinet des Médailles of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris showing Christ crowning an Emperor, named as Romanos, and his Empress. This is thought to be either Romanos II crowned in 959, or possibly Romanos IV, crowned in 1068. Related works are in Rome, the Vatican, and Moscow, this last another coronation probably datable to 944.\n\nOf this \"Romanos group\" the \"Harbaville Triptych\" is considered \"by far the finest, for it shows an elegance and delicacy which are absent in the others. All are in the polished, elegant style typical of the Court school.\" Other groups of ivories have also been identified, presumably representing the output of different workshops, perhaps also employed by the Court, but generally of lower quality, or at least refinement. Since much greater numbers of ivories survive than panel paintings from the period, they are very important for the history of Macedonian art.\n\nAll sides of the triptych are fully carved, with more saints on the outsides of the side leaves, and an elaborate decorative scheme on the back of the central leaf.\n\nThe ivory's early history is unrecorded. It derives its name from its first known owner, the antiquarian Louis-François Harbaville (1791-1866), who inherited it from his in-laws, the Beugny de Pommeras family of Arras. It was purchased for the Louvre in 1891 from Harbaville's grandsons and heirs.\n\n"}

During the episode, a technical error occurred during the final jackpot round of the show's \"Wilyonaryo\" segment which raised allegations within the media that the segment was, or could be, rigged by the producers. The incident prompted an investigation by the country's Department of Trade and Industry, and was also the catalyst of an on-air feud between Revillame and Joey de Leon, a personality from the rival GMA Network.\n\nABS-CBN, who claimed that the incident was the result of a \"design flaw\" that had been fixed, was fined ₱290,000 by the Department of Trade and Industry for violating the country's Consumers Act.\n\nDuring the episode, a contestant named Weng participated in the \"Wilyonaryo\" segment of the show. In the earlier rounds, she had won ₱37,000. For the jackpot portion of the game, out of the 12 \"wheels\" used in the game; she was randomly given a white-colored wheel. Weng now had to choose between two big prizes: the ₱100,000 that the host Willie Revillame was offering her, or whatever was inside the white wheel, which, according to the rules, could be a jackpot prize of ₱2,000,000 (US$45,000), a jackpot prize of ₱1,000,000 (US$22,500), a jackpot prize of ₱500,000 (US$11,250), a house and lot, or nothing at all (which would be signified by the numeral zero).\n\nAt first, she decided to go with what was inside the white wheel. However, after being prodded by the hosts to take the money instead, Weng decided to forgo the possible jackpot prize revealed in the white wheel and instead take home the ₱100,000 for this round, plus the ₱37,000 from the earlier round. After this, Willie pulled the dark film from the window embedded in the wheel to reveal what prize the contestant had lost by choosing to take home the ₱137,000. Pulling the dark film revealed the numeral zero. This meant that if she had chosen the white wheel instead, she would have gone home with only ₱37,000.\n\nAfter the decision, Willie went on to reveal where the other prizes—the ₱2,000,000 cash prize, the ₱1,000,000 cash prize, the ₱500,000 cash prize, and the house and lot—were hidden. He said that the symbol for the ₱2,000,000 cash prize—the numeral \"2\"—was in the window of the violet wheel. He was handed the violet wheel, and he reached behind the wheel, supposedly to pull the dark film in order to reveal the numeral \"2.\" However, when he pulled the film, the numeral \"0\" appeared instead. He appeared to fiddle with the back of the wheel and then he pulled out two films: one dark film (supposedly the \"cover\" film) and another film with the numeral \"2\" printed on it. As he held those two films in his hand, the numeral \"0\" was still visible in the window of the violet wheel.\n\nAlthough ABS-CBN officials stated that this occurrence with the then-new game was a \"mechanical glitch\" and an honest mistake, controversy erupted as many critics asked whether the mistake was a sign that the show—or at least this portion of the show—could be or was rigged.\n\nThe scandal grew after Joey de Leon, one of the hosts of \"Eat Bulaga!\"—a rival variety show broadcast by GMA Network, began making comments about the incident - ending an edition of his Manila Bulletin entertainment column about the incident with the statement, \"Teasing is not bad. Cheating is ... on TV.\"\n\nOn the August 29, 2007 episode of \"Wowowee\", Willie Revillame emotionally, but obviously no shed of tears, addressed Joey de Leon and insisted that he had not been cheating. Joey retaliated Willie's statement the following day in a 15-minute-long monologue on \"Eat Bulaga!\" by advising his rival to \"explain before you complain\"; not mentioning Willie or \"Wowowee\" directly at all during the speech, but clearly directing the speech at him. He also accused Willie of resorting to personal attacks in order to dodge questions about the incident. Joey also clarified in the address that he was not directly accusing Willie or the \"Wowowee\" staff of cheating; noting that the only information he got about the incident was through video postings on YouTube and text messages he had received about the incident.\n\nOn August 30, 2007, Senator Mar Roxas, chair of the Senate trade and commerce committee, announced that he would propose an inquiry into this alleged game rigging after getting information from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and concerned parties. Joey had jokingly called upon lawmakers to stop probing the Hello Garci scandal, and to start probing the \"Hello Pappy\" scandal during his speech the previous day. The game was also later discontinued from the show.\n\nThe Movie and Television Review and Classification Board also became increasingly concerned about the scandal due to the escalating on-air feuds between Willie and Joeyasking Willie to make an on-air apology about his remarks towards Joey on the September 4 episode of \"Wowowee\".\n\nIn response to the incident, network Vice President Bong Osorio stated that a fixed \"design flaw\" was the cause of the incident, further remarking that \"[we] have no intention to manipulate results, but rather to add excitement and suspense.\" Osorio also stated that a game shows can experience \"glitches\" during development, and re-enforced that all game shows broadcast by the network were operated in accordance with ABS-CBN's corporate values of honesty and integrity.\n\nOn October 13, 2008, the DTI ordered ABS-CBN to pay an administrative fine of ₱290,000, ruling that the \"Wilyonaryo\" segment violated the Consumers Act of the Philippines, ruling that “A reasonable assessment of the existing game mechanics and procedures reveals that the game show segment allowed for reasonable likelihood of error and provided the host and organizers significant latitude in controlling the outcome of the contest.” ABS-CBN later released a statement that they would file an appeal on the decision.\n\n"}
{"id": "649575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=649575", "title": "Heteroglossia", "text": "Heteroglossia\n\nThe term heteroglossia describes the coexistence of distinct varieties within a single \"language\" (in Greek: \"hetero-\" \"different\" and \"glōssa\" \"tongue, language\"). In this way the term translates the Russian разноречие [\"raznorechie\"], which was introduced by the Russian linguist Mikhail Bakhtin in his 1934 paper \"Слово в романе\" [Slovo v romane], published in English as \"Discourse in the Novel.\"\n\nBakhtin argues that the power of the novel originates in the coexistence of, and conflict between, different types of speech: the speech of characters, the speech of narrators, and even the speech of the author. He defines heteroglossia as \"another's speech in another's language, serving to express authorial intentions but in a refracted way\"(1934). Bakhtin identifies the direct narrative of the author, rather than dialogue between characters, as the primary location of this conflict.\n\nBakhtin viewed the modern novel as a literary form best suited for the exploitation of heteroglossia, in direct contrast to epic poetry (and, in a lesser degree, poetry in general). The linguistic energy of the novel was seen in its expression of the conflict between voices through their description to different elements in the novel's discourse.\n\nAny language, in Bakhtin's view, stratifies into many voices: \"social dialects, characteristic group behaviour, professional jargons, generic languages, languages of generations and age groups, tendentious languages, languages of the authorities, of various circles and of passing fashions\". This diversity of voice is, Bakhtin asserts, the defining characteristic of the novel as a genre.\n\nTraditional stylistics, like epic poetry, do not share the trait of heteroglossia. In Bakhtin's words, \"poetry depersonalizes 'days' in language, while prose, as we shall see, often deliberately intensifies difference between them...\"\n\nExtending his argument, Bakhtin proposes that all languages represent a distinct point of view on the world, characterized by its own meaning and values. In this view, language is \"shot through with intentions and accents\" (1981: 324), and thus there are no neutral words. Even the most unremarkable statement possesses a taste, whether of a profession, a party, a generation, a place or a time. To Bakhtin, words do not exist until they are spoken, and that moment they are printed with the signature of the speaker.\n\nBakhtin identifies the act of speech, or of writing, as a literary-verbal performance, one that requires speakers or authors to take a position, even if only by choosing the dialect in which they will speak. Separate languages are often identified with separate circumstances. Bakhtin gives an example of an illiterate peasant, who speaks Church Slavonic to God, speaks to his family in their own peculiar dialect, sings songs in yet a third, and attempts to emulate officious high-class dialect when he dictates petitions to the local government. The prose writer, Bakhtin argues, must welcome and incorporate these many languages into his work.\n\nThe hybrid utterance, as defined by Bakhtin, is a passage that employs only a single speaker—the author, for example—but one or more kinds of speech. The juxtaposition of the two different speeches brings with it a contradiction and conflict in belief systems.\n\nIn examination of the English comic novel, particularly the works of Charles Dickens, Bakhtin identifies examples of his argument. Dickens parodies both the 'common tongue' and the language of Parliament or high-class banquets, using concealed languages to create humor. In one passage, Dickens shifts from his authorial narrative voice into a formalized, almost epic tone while describing the work of an unremarkable bureaucrat; his intent is to parody the self-importance and vainglory of the bureaucrat's position. The use of concealed speech, without formal markers of a speaker change, is what allows the parody to work. It is, in Bakhtin's parlance, a hybrid utterance. In this instance the conflict is between the factual narrative and the biting hyperbole of the new, epic/formalistic tone.\n\nBakhtin goes on to discuss the interconnectedness of conversation. Even a simple dialogue, in his view, is full of quotations and references, often to a general \"everyone says\" or \"I heard that..\" Opinion and information are transmitted by way of reference to an indefinite, general source. By way of these references, humans selectively assimilate the discourse of others and make it their own.\n\nBakhtin identifies a specific type of discourse, the \"authoritative discourse,\" which demands to be assimilated by the reader or listener; examples might be religious dogma, or scientific theory, or a popular book. This type of discourse is viewed as past, finished, hierarchically superior, and therefore demands \"unconditional allegiance\" rather than accepting interpretation. Because of this, Bakhtin states that authoritative discourse plays an insignificant role in the novel. Because it is not open to interpretation, it cannot enter into hybrid utterance.\n\nBakhtin concludes by arguing that the role of the novel is to draw the authoritative into question, and to allow what was once considered certain to be debated and open to interpretation. In effect, novels not only function through heteroglossia, but must promote it; to do otherwise is an artistic failure.\n\nBakhtin's view of heteroglossia has been often employed in the context of the postmodern critique of the perceived teleological and authoritarian character of modernist art and culture. In particular, the latter's strong disdain for popular forms of art and literature—archetypically expressed in Adorno and Horkheimer's analysis of the culture industry—has been criticised as a proponent of \"monoglossia\"; practitioners of cultural studies have used Bakhtin's conceptual framework to theorise the critical reappropriation of mass-produced entertainment forms by the public.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "866993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=866993", "title": "Legal psychology", "text": "Legal psychology\n\nLegal psychology involves empirical, psychological research of the law, legal institutions, and people who come into contact with the law. Legal psychologists typically take basic social and cognitive principles and apply them to issues in the legal system such as eyewitness memory, jury decision-making, investigations, and interviewing. The term \"legal psychology\" has only recently come into usage, primarily as a way to differentiate the experimental focus of legal psychology from the clinically-oriented forensic psychology.\n\nTogether, legal psychology and forensic psychology form the field more generally recognized as \"psychology and law\". Following earlier efforts by psychologists to address legal issues, psychology and law became a field of study in the 1960s as part of an effort to enhance justice, though that originating concern has lessened over time. The multidisciplinary American Psychological Association's Division 41, the American Psychology-Law Society, is active with the goal of promoting the contributions of psychology to the understanding of law and legal systems through research, as well as providing education to psychologists in legal issues and providing education to legal personnel on psychological issues. Further, its mandate is to inform the psychological and legal communities and the public at large of current research, educational, and service in the area of psychology and law. There are similar societies in Britain and Europe.\n\nGenerally speaking, any research that combines psychological principles with legal applications or contexts could be considered legal psychology (although research involving clinical psychology, e.g., mental illness, competency, insanity defense, offender profiling, etc., is typically categorized as forensic psychology, and not legal psychology). For a time, legal psychology researchers were primarily focused on issues related to eyewitness testimony and jury decision-making; so much so, that the editor of \"Law and Human Behavior\", the premier legal psychology journal, implored researchers to expand the scope of their research and move on to other areas.\n\nThere are several legal psychology journals, including \"Law and Human Behavior\", \"Psychology, Public Policy and Law\", \"Psychology, Crime, and Law\", and \"Journal of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law\" that focus on general topics of criminology, and the criminal justice system. In addition, research by legal psychologists is regularly published in more general journals that cover both basic and applied research areas.\n\nIn March 1893 J. McKeen Cattell posted questions to fifty-six of his students at Columbia University, the questions he asked his students were comparable to those asked in a court of justice. What he found was that it was reasonable to conclude eyewitness accounts of events were unreliable. His students were all sure they were mostly correct, even when they weren’t, and some were hesitant when they were in fact correct. He could not figure out specifically why each student had inaccurate testimonies. Cattell suggested that “an unscrupulous attorney” could discredit a witness who is being truthful by asking “cunningly selected questions”. Although a jury, or the judge, should know how normal errors are in eyewitness testimonies given different conditions. However, even Cattell was shocked by the level of incorrectness displayed by his students. Cattell’s research has been depicted as the foundation of forensic psychology in the United States. His research is still widely considered a prevailing research interest in legal psychology. It has been thought that in America psychologists have been used as expert witnesses in court testimonies since the early 1920’s. Consultation within civil courts was most common, during this time criminal courts rarely consulted with psychologists. Psychologists were not considered medical experts, those who were like, physicians and psychiatrists, in the past were the ones consulted for criminal testimonies. This could be because in criminal cases, the defendant's mental state almost never mattered \"As a general rule, only medical men — that is, persons licensed by law to practice the profession of medicine — can testify as experts on the question of insanity; and the propriety of this general limitation is too patent to permit discussion\".\n\nLegal psychologists typically hold a PhD in some area of psychology (e.g., clinical psychology, social psychology, cognitive psychology, etc.), and apply their knowledge of that field to the law. Although formal legal training (such as a JD or Master of Legal Studies degree) can be beneficial, most legal psychologists hold only the PhD. In fact, some argue that specialized legal training dilutes the psychological empiricism of the researcher. For instance, to understand how eyewitness memory \"works\", a psychologist should be concerned with memory processes as a whole, instead of only the aspects relevant to the law (e.g., lineups, accuracy of testimony).\n\nA growing number of universities offer specialized training in legal psychology as either a standalone PhD program or a joint JD/PhD program. A list of American universities that offer graduate training in legal psychology can be found here on the website of the American Psychology-Law Society.\n\nMany legal psychologists work as professors in university psychology departments, criminal justice departments or law schools. Like other professors, legal psychologists generally conduct and publish empirical research, teach various classes, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students. Many legal psychologists also conduct research in a more general area of psychology (e.g., social, clinical, cognitive) with only a tangential legal focus. Those legal psychologists who work in law schools almost always hold a JD in addition to a PhD\n\nPsychologists specifically trained in legal issues, as well as those with no formal training, are often called by legal parties to testify as expert witnesses. In criminal trials, an expert witness may be called to testify about eyewitness memory, mistaken identity, competence to stand trial, the propensity of a death-qualified jury to also be \"pro-guilt\", etc. Psychologists who focus on clinical issues often testify specifically about a defendant's competence, intelligence, etc. More general testimony about perceptual issues (e.g., adequacy of police sirens) may also come up in trial.\n\nExperts, particularly psychology experts, are often accused of being \"hired guns\" or \"stating the obvious\". Eyewitness memory experts, such as Elizabeth Loftus, are often discounted by judges and lawyers with no empirical training because their research utilizes undergraduate students and \"unrealistic\" scenarios. If both sides have psychological witnesses, jurors may have the daunting task of assessing difficult scientific information.\n\nPsychologists employed at public policy centers may attempt to influence legislative policy or may be called upon by state (or national) lawmakers to address some policy issue through empirical research. A psychologist working in public policy might suggest laws or help to evaluate a new legal practice (e.g., eyewitness lineups).\n\nLegal psychologists may hold advisory roles in court systems. They may advise legal decision makers, particularly judges, on psychological findings pertaining to issues in a case. The psychologist who acts as a court adviser provides similar input to one acting as an expert witness, but acts out of the domain of an adversarial system.\n\nPsychologists can provide an amicus brief to the court. The American Psychological Association has provided briefs concerning mental illness, retardation and other factors. The amicus brief usually contains an opinion backed by scientific citations and statistics. The impact of an amicus brief by a psychological association is questionable. For instance, Justice Powell once called a reliance on statistics \"numerology\" and discounted results of several empirical studies. Judges who have no formal scientific training also may critique experimental methods, and some feel that judges only cite an amicus brief when the brief supports the judge's personal beliefs.\n\nSome legal psychologists work in trial consulting. No special training nor certification is needed to be a trial consultant, though an advanced degree is generally welcomed by those who would hire the trial consultant. The American Society of Trial Consultants does have a code of ethics for members, but there are no legally binding ethical rules for consultants.\n\nSome psychologists who work in academics are hired as trial consultants when their expertise can be useful to a particular case. Other psychologists/consultants work for or with established trial consultant firms. The practice of law firms hiring \"in-house\" trial consultants is becoming more popular, but these consultants usually can also be used by the firms as practicing attorneys.\n\nTrial consultants perform a variety of services for lawyers, such as picking jurors (usually relying on in-house or published statistical studies) or performing \"mock trials\" with focus groups. Trial consultants work on all stages of a case from helping to organize testimony, preparing witnesses to testify, picking juries, and even arranging \"shadow jurors\" to watch the trial unfold and provide input on the trial. There is some debate on whether the work of a trial consultant is protected under attorney-client privilege, especially when the consultant is hired by a party in the case and not by an attorney.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "651326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=651326", "title": "Macaronic language", "text": "Macaronic language\n\nMacaronic language refers to text using a mixture of languages, particularly bilingual puns or situations in which the languages are otherwise used in the same context (rather than simply discrete segments of a text being in different languages). The term can also denote hybrid words, which are effectively \"internally macaronic\". A rough equivalent in spoken language is code-switching, a term in linguistics referring to using more than one language or dialect within the same conversation.\n\nMacaronic Latin in particular is a jumbled jargon made up of vernacular words given Latin endings, or for Latin words mixed with the vernacular in a pastiche (compare dog Latin).\n\nThe word \"macaronic\" comes from the New Latin \"macaronicus\" which is from the Italian \"maccarone\" (\"dumpling\", regarded as coarse peasant fare). The term can have derogatory overtones, and is usually reserved for works where the mixing of languages has a humorous or satirical intent or effect. It is a matter of debate whether the term can be applied to mixed-language literature of a more serious nature and purpose.\n\nTexts that mixed Latin and vernacular language apparently arose throughout Europe at the end of the Middle Ages—a time when Latin was still the working language of scholars, clerics and university students, but was losing ground to vernacular among poets, minstrels and storytellers.\n\nAn early example is from 1130, in the Gospel book of Munsterbilzen Abbey. The following sentence mixes late Old Dutch and Latin:\n<poem>\nTesi samanunga was edele unde scona\net omnium virtutum pleniter plena\n</poem>\nTranslated: \"This community was noble and pure, and completely full of all virtues.\"\n\nThe \"Carmina Burana\" (collected c.1230) contains several poems mixing Latin with Medieval German or French. Another well-known example is the first stanza of the famous carol \"In Dulci Jubilo\", whose original version (written around 1328) had Latin mixed with German, with a hint of Greek. While some of those early works had a clear humorous intent, many use the language mix for lyrical effect.\n\nAnother early example is in the Middle English recitals \"The Towneley Plays\" (c.1460). In \"The Talents\" (play 24), Pontius Pilate delivers a rhyming speech in mixed English and Latin.\n\nA number of English political poems in the 14th century alternated (Middle) English and Latin lines, such as in MS Digby 196:\n<poem>The taxe hath tened [ruined] vs alle,\n\nSeveral Anthems also contain both Latin and English. In the case of 'Nolo mortem pecatoris' by Thomas Morley, the Latin is used as a refrain:\n\n<poem>\nNolo mortem peccatoris; Haec sunt verba Salvatoris.\nFather I am thine only Son, sent down from heav’n mankind to save.\nFather, all things fulfilled and done according to thy will, I have.\nFather, my will now all is this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.\nFather, behold my painful smart, taken for man on ev’ry side;\nEv'n from my birth to death most tart, no kind of pain I have denied,\nbut suffered all, and all for this: Nolo mortem peccatoris.\n</poem>\nTranslated: \"'I do not wish the death of the wicked'; These are the words of the Saviour.\" An allusion to John 3:17 and 2 Peter 3:9.\n\nThe term \"macaronic\" is believed to have originated in Padua in the late 15th century, apparently from \"maccarona\", a kind of pasta or dumpling eaten by peasants at that time. (That is also the presumed origin of \"maccheroni\".) Its association with the genre comes from the \"Macaronea\", a comical poem by Tifi Odasi in mixed Latin and Italian, published in 1488 or 1489. Another example of the genre is \"Tosontea\" by Corrado of Padua, which was published at about the same time as Tifi's \"Macaronea\".\n\nTifi and his contemporaries clearly intended to satirize the broken Latin used by many doctors, scholars and bureaucrats of their time. While this \"macaronic Latin\" (\"macaronica verba\") could be due to ignorance or carelessness, it could also be the result of its speakers trying to make themselves understood by the vulgar folk without resorting to their speech.\n\nAn important and unusual example of mixed-language text is the \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\" of Francesco Colonna (1499), which was basically written using Italian syntax and morphology, but using a made-up vocabulary based on roots from Latin, Greek, and occasionally others. However, while the \"Hypnerotomachia\" is contemporary with Tifi's \"Macaronea\", its mixed language is not used for plain humor, but rather as an aesthetic device to underscore the fantastic but refined nature of the book.\n\nTifi's \"Macaronea\" was a popular success, and the writing of humorous texts in macaronic Latin became a fad in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in Italian, but also in many other European languages. An important Italian example was \"Baldo\" by Teofilo Folengo, who described his own verses as \"a gross, rude, and rustic mixture of flour, cheese, and butter\".\n\nMacaronic verse is especially common in cultures with widespread bilingualism or language contact, such as Ireland before the middle of the nineteenth century. Macaronic traditional songs such as \"Siúil A Rúin\" are quite common in Ireland. In Scotland, macaronic songs have been popular among Highland immigrants to Glasgow, using English and Scottish Gaelic as a device to express the alien nature of the anglophone environment. An example:\n\nWhen I came down to Glasgow first,\na-mach air Tìr nan Gall.\nI was like a man adrift,\nair iomrall 's doll air chall.\n\nFolk and popular music of the Andes frequently alternates between Spanish and the given South American language of its region of origin.\n\nSome Classical Persian poems were written with alternating Persian and Arabic verses or hemistichs, most famously by Saadi and Hafez. Such poems were called \"molamma‘\" (, literally \"speckled\", plural \"molamma‘āt\" ), Residing in Anatolia, in some of his poems Rumi mixed Persian with Arabic as well as the local languages of Turkish and Greek.\n\nMacaronic verse was also common in medieval India, where the influence of the Muslim rulers led to poems being written in alternating indigenous Hindi and the Persian language. This style was used by the famous poet Amir Khusro and played a major role in the rise of the Urdu or Hindustani language.\n\nThe Sublime song \"Caress Me Down\" alternates between English and Spanish lyrics, at some points between verses, at others between lines within a verse, and occasionally between phrases within a line.\n\nOccasionally language is unintentionally macaronic. One particularly famed piece of schoolyard Greek in France is Xenophon's line \"they did not take the city; but in fact they had no hope of taking it\" (, \"ouk élabon pólin; álla gàr elpìs éphē kaká\"). Read in the French manner, this becomes \"Où qu'est la bonne Pauline? A la gare. Elle pisse et fait caca.\" (\"Where is Pauline the maid? At the [railway] station. She's pissing and taking a shit.\") In English literature, the untranslated line makes an appearance in James Joyce's \"Finnegans Wake\".\n\nMacaronic text is still used by modern Italian authors, e.g. by Carlo Emilio Gadda and Beppe Fenoglio. Other examples are provided by the character Salvatore in Umberto Eco's \"The Name of the Rose\", and the peasant hero of his \"Baudolino\". Dario Fo's \"Mistero Buffo\" (\"Comic Mystery Play\") features grammelot sketches using language with macaronic elements.\n\nThe 2001 novel \"The Last Samurai\" by Helen DeWitt includes portions of Japanese, Classical Greek, and Inuktitut, although the reader is not expected to understand the passages that are not in English.\n\nMacaronic games are used by the literary group Oulipo in the form of interlinguistic homophonic transformation: replacing\na known phrase with homophones from another language. The archetypal example is by François Le Lionnais, who transformed John Keats' \"A thing of beauty is a joy forever\" into \"Un singe de beauté est un jouet pour l'hiver\": 'A monkey of beauty is a toy for the winter'. Another example is the book \"Mots d'Heures\".\n\nMacaronisms figure prominently in \"The Trilogy\" by the Polish novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz, and are one of the major compositional principles for James Joyce's novel \"Finnegans Wake\".\n\nTwo well-known examples of non-humorous macaronic verse are Byron's \"Maid of Athens, ere we part\" (1810, in English with a Greek refrain); and Pearsall's translation of the carol \"In Dulci Jubilo\" (1837, in mixed English and Latin verse).\n\nAn example of modern humorous macaronic verse is the anonymous English/Latin poem \"Carmen Possum\" (\"The Opossum's Song\"), which is sometimes used as a teaching and motivational aid in elementary Latin language classes. Other similar examples are \"The Motor Bus\" by A. D. Godley, and the anonymous \"Up I arose in verno tempore\".\n\nRecent examples are the \"mużajki\" or 'mosaics' (2007) of Maltese poet Antoine Cassar mixing English, Spanish, Maltese, Italian, and French; works of Italian writer Guido Monte; and the late poetry of Ivan Blatný combining Czech with English. \n\nBrian P. Cleary's \"What Can I C'est?\" makes use of macaronic verse, as do other poems in his book \"Rainbow Soup: Adventures in Poetry\":\n\nMy auntie Michelle is big in the BON\n(As well as the hip and the thigh).\nAnd when she exhales, OUI haul out our sails\nAnd ride on the wind of VERSAILLES.\n\nA whole body of comic verse exists created by John O'Mill, pseudonym of Johan van der Meulen, a teacher of English at the Rijks HBS (State Grammar School), Breda, the Netherlands. These are in a mixture of English and Dutch, often playing on common mistakes made when translating from the latter to the former.\n\nThe finale of act 1 of Gilbert and Sullivan's Savoy Opera Iolanthe has several instances of humorous macaronic verse. \n\nFirst, the three Lords mix Italian and Latin phrases into their discussion of Iolanthe's age:\nLord Mountararat: This gentleman is seen, / With a maid of seventeen, / A-taking of his \"dolce far niente\"...\nLord Chancellor: Recollect yourself, I pray, / And be careful what you say- / As the ancient Romans said, \"festina lente\"...\nLord Tolloller: I have often had a use / For a thorough-bred excuse / Of a sudden (which is English for \"repente\")...\nLord Mountararat: Now, listen, pray to me, / For this paradox will be / Carried, nobody at all \"contradicente\"...\n\nThen, the chorus of peers sing macaronic verse as they attempt to resist the fairies' powers:\nOur lordly style you shall not quench with base \"canaille\"! (That word is French.) \nDistinction ebbs before a herd of vulgar \"plebs\"! (A Latin word.)\nTwould fill with joy and madness stark the \"oι πoλλoί\"! (A Greek remark.) \nOne Latin word, one Greek remark, and one that's French.\n\n'Macaronisms' are frequently used in films, especially comedies. In Charlie Chaplin's anti-war comedy \"The Great Dictator\", the title character speaks English mixed with a parody of German (e.g. \"Cheese-und-cracken\"). This was also used by Benzino Napaloni, the parody character of Benito Mussolini, using Italian foods (such as salami and ravioli) as insults.\n\nOther movies featuring macaronic language are the Italian historical comedies \"L'armata Brancaleone\" and \"Brancaleone alle crociate\" (d. Mario Monicelli), which mix modern and medieval Italian as well as Latin (sometimes in rhyme, and sometimes with regional connotations, such as the Italo-Normans using words from modern Sicilian).\n\nMacaronic language appearing in popular songs include Dean Martin's \"That's Amore\" (Italian and English), the Beatles’ \"Michelle\" (French and English), The Clash’s \"Spanish Bombs\" and José Feliciano’s \"Feliz Navidad\" (Spanish and English), the Talking Heads \"Psycho Killer\" (French and English), and The Weeknd's Montreal (French and English).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "74805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74805", "title": "Mother Goose", "text": "Mother Goose\n\nThe figure of Mother Goose is the imaginary author of a collection of French fairy tales and later of English nursery rhymes. As a character, she appeared in a song, the first stanza of which often functions now as a nursery rhyme. This, however, was dependent on a Christmas pantomime, a successor to which is still performed in the United Kingdom. \nThe term's appearance in English dates back to the early 18th century, when Charles Perrault’s fairy tale collection, \"Contes de ma Mère l'Oye\", was first translated into English as \"Tales of My Mother Goose\". Later a compilation of English nursery rhymes, titled \"Mother Goose's Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle\", helped perpetuate the name both in Britain and the United States.\n\nMother Goose's name was identified with English collections of stories and nursery rhymes popularised in the 17th century. English readers would already have been familiar with Mother Hubbard, a stock figure when Edmund Spenser published the satire Mother Hubberd's Tale in 1590, as well as with similar fairy tales told by \"Mother Bunch\" (the pseudonym of Madame d'Aulnoy) in the 1690s. An early mention appears in an aside in a versified French chronicle of weekly events, Jean Loret's \"La Muse Historique\", collected in 1650. His remark, \"comme un conte de la Mère Oye\" (\"like a Mother Goose story\") shows that the term was readily understood. Additional 17th-century Mother Goose/Mere l'Oye references appear in French literature in the 1620s and 1630s. In the 20th century, Katherine Elwes-Thomas theorised that the image and name \"Mother Goose\" or \"Mère l'Oye\" might be based upon ancient legends of the wife of King Robert II of France, known as \"Berthe la fileuse\" (\"Bertha the Spinner\") or \"Berthe pied d'oie\" (\"Goose-Footed Bertha\" ), often described as spinning incredible tales that enraptured children. Other scholars have pointed out that Charlemagne's mother, Bertrada of Laon, came to be known as the goose-foot queen (\"regina pede aucae\"). There are even sources that trace Mother Goose's origin back to the biblical Queen of Sheba.\nDespite evidence to the contrary, it has been claimed in America that the original Mother Goose was the Bostonian wife of Isaac Goose, either named Elizabeth Foster Goose (1665–1758) or Mary Goose (d. 1690, age 42). Alternatively, the original Mother Goose lived in Boston in the 1660s, reportedly as the second wife of Isaac Goose (alternatively named Vergoose or Vertigoose), who brought to the marriage six children of her own to add to Isaac's ten. After Isaac died, Elizabeth went to live with her eldest daughter, who had married Thomas Fleet, a publisher who lived on Pudding Lane (now Devonshire Street). According to Early, \"Mother Goose\" used to sing songs and ditties to her grandchildren all day, and other children swarmed to hear them. Finally, her son-in-law gathered her jingles together and printed them, though no evidence of such prints has been found.\n\nIona and Peter Opie, leading authorities on nursery lore, give no credence to either the Elwes-Thomas or the Boston suppositions. It is generally accepted that the term does not refer to any particular person.\n\nCharles Perrault, one of the initiators of the literary fairy tale genre, published a collection of such tales in 1695 called \"Histoires ou contes du temps passés, avec des moralités\" under the name of his son, which became better known under its subtitle of \"Contes de ma mère l'Oye\" or \"Tales of My Mother Goose\". Perrault's publication marks the first authenticated starting-point for Mother Goose stories.\n\nIn 1729, an English translation appeared of Perrault's collection, Robert Samber's \"Histories or Tales of Past Times, Told by Mother Goose\", which introduced \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Little Red Riding Hood\", \"Puss in Boots\", \"Cinderella\", and other Perrault tales to English-speaking audiences. The first public appearance of the Mother Goose stories in the America was in Worcester, Massachusetts, where printer Isaiah Thomas reprinted Samber's volume under the same title in 1786.\n\nMaurice Ravel ‘s \"Ma mère l'oye\" suite is dependent on Perrault’s collection. Starting with five pieces for piano duet in 1908-10, he then orchestrated them for a ballet in which two of the episodes were named after the fairy tale characters Sleeping Beauty and Tom Thumb. The ballet was first performed in Paris in 1912 and later that year in Chicago. \n\nJohn Newbery was once believed to have published a compilation of English nursery rhymes titled \", or, Sonnets for the cradle\" some time in the 1760s, but the first edition was probably published in 1780 or 1781 by Thomas Carnan, one of Newbery's successors (and stepson). This edition was registered with the Stationers' Company, London in 1780. However, no copy has been traced, and the earliest surviving edition is dated 1784. The name \"Mother Goose\" has been associated in the English-speaking world with children's poetry ever since.\n\nIn 1834, John Bellenden Ker Gawler published a book (with a 2nd-volume sequel in 1840) deriving the origin of the \"Mother Goose\" rhymes as arising from political disaffection expressed in a largely invented Flemish language, an effort described by the Opies as \"the most extraordinary example of misdirected labour in the history of English letters\".\n\nIn addition to being the purported author of nursery rhymes, Mother Goose is herself the title character in one recorded by the Opies, only the first verse of which figures in later editions of their book. Titled \"Old Mother Goose and the Golden Egg\", this verse prefaced a 15-stanza poem that rambled through a variety of adventures involving not only the egg but also Mother Goose's son Jack. There exists an illustrated chapbook omitting their opening stanza that dates from the 1820s and another version was recorded by J. O. Halliwell in his \"The Nursery Rhymes of England\" (1842). Other shorter versions were also recorded later. \n\nAll of them, however, were dependent on a very successful pantomime first performed in 1806, and it is only by reference to its script that the unexplained gaps in the poem’s narration are made clear. The pantomime was the work of Thomas John Dibdin and its title, \"Harlequin and Mother Goose, or The Golden Egg\", signals how it combines the \"Commedia dell'arte\" tradition and other folk elements with fable - in this case \"The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs\". The stage version became a vehicle for the clown Joseph Grimaldi, who played the part of Avaro, but there was also a shorter script for shadow pantomime which allowed special effects of a different kind..\n\nSpecial effects were needed since the folk elements in the story made a witch-figure of Mother Goose. In reference to this, and especially the opening stanza, illustrations of Mother Goose began depicting her as an old lady with a strong chin who wears a tall pointed hat and flies astride a goose. Ryoji Tsurumi has commented on the folk aspects of this figure in his monograph on the play. In the first scene, the stage directions show her raising a storm and, for the very first time onstage, flying a gander – and she later raises a ghost in a macabre churchyard scene. These elements contrast with others from the harlequinade tradition in which the old miser Avaro transforms into Pantaloon, while the young lovers Colin and Colinette become Harlequin and Columbine.\n\nA new Mother Goose pantomime was written for the comedian Dan Leno by J. Hickory Wood in 1902. This had a different story line in which the poor but happy Mother Goose is tempted with wealth by the Devil. This was the ancestor of all the pantomimes of that title that followed, adaptations of which continue to appear.\n\nBecause nursery rhymes are usually referred to as Mother Goose songs in the US, however, children’s entertainments in which a medley of nursery characters are introduced to sing their rhymes often introduced her name into American titles. Early 20th century examples of these include \"A dream of Mother Goose and other entertainments\" by J.C. Marchant and S.J. Mayhew (Boston, 1908); \"Miss Muffet Lost and Found : a Mother Goose play\" by Katharine C. Baker (Chicago, 1915); \"The Modern Mother Goose: a play in three acts\" by Helen Hamilton (Chicago, 1916); and the up-to-the-moment \"The Strike Mother Goose Settled\" by Evelyn Hoxie (Franklin Ohio and Denver Colorado, 1922).\n\nThere have been numerous adaptations of Mother Goose with the classic nursery rhymes and adaptations with a distinct motif including:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11388236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11388236", "title": "Seattle", "text": "Seattle\n\nSeattle ( ) is a seaport city on the West Coast of the United States. It is the seat of King County, Washington. With an estimated 730,000 residents , Seattle is the largest city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. According to U.S. Census data released in 2018, the Seattle metropolitan area’s population stands at 3.87 million, and ranks as the 15th largest in the United States. In July 2013, it was the fastest-growing major city in the United States and remained in the Top 5 in May 2015 with an annual growth rate of 2.1%. In July 2016, Seattle was again the fastest-growing major U.S. city, with a 3.1% annual growth rate. Seattle is the northernmost large city in the contiguous United States.\n\nThe city is situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington, about south of the Canada–United States border. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling .\n\nThe Seattle area was inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers. Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers, subsequently known as the Denny Party, arrived from Illinois via Portland, Oregon, on the schooner \"Exact\" at Alki Point on November 13, 1851. The settlement was moved to the eastern shore of Elliott Bay and named \"Seattle\" in 1852, in honor of Chief Si'ahl of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes.\n\nLogging was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century, the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. Growth after World War II was partially due to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed into a technology center from the 1980s onwards with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region; Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a Seattleite by birth. Internet retailer Amazon was founded in Seattle in 1994, and major airline Alaska Airlines was founded in SeaTac, Washington, serving Seattle's international airport, Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000.\n\nSeattle has a noteworthy musical history. From 1918 to 1951, nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Ernestine Anderson, and others. Seattle is also the birthplace of rock musician Jimi Hendrix, as well as the origin of the bands Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Foo Fighters and the alternative rock movement grunge.\n\nArchaeological excavations suggest that Native Americans have inhabited the Seattle area for at least 4,000 years. By the time the first European settlers arrived, the people (subsequently called the Duwamish tribe) occupied at least seventeen villages in the areas around Elliott Bay.\n\nThe first European to visit the Seattle area was George Vancouver, in May 1792 during his 1791–95 expedition to chart the Pacific Northwest.\nIn 1851, a large party led by Luther Collins made a location on land at the mouth of the Duwamish River; they formally claimed it on September 14, 1851. Thirteen days later, members of the Collins Party on the way to their claim passed three scouts of the Denny Party. Members of the Denny Party claimed land on Alki Point on September 28, 1851. The rest of the Denny Party set sail from Portland, Oregon, and landed on Alki point during a rainstorm on November 13, 1851.\n\nAfter a difficult winter, most of the Denny Party relocated across Elliott Bay and claimed land a second time at the site of present-day Pioneer Square, naming this new settlement \"Duwamps\".\n\nCharles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location and reestablished their old land claim and called it \"New York,\" but renamed \"New York Alki\" in April 1853, from a Chinook word meaning, roughly, \"by and by\" or \"someday.\"\n\nFor the next few years, New York Alki and Duwamps competed for dominance, but in time Alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers.\n\nDavid Swinson \"Doc\" Maynard, one of the founders of Duwamps, was the primary advocate to name the settlement after Chief Seattle (\"Seattle\") of the Duwamish and Suquamish tribes.\n\nThe name \"Seattle\" appears on official Washington Territory papers dated May 23, 1853, when the first plats for the village were filed. In 1855, nominal land settlements were established. On January 14, 1865, the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a board of trustees managing the city. The Town of Seattle was disincorporated on January 18, 1867, and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869, when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated December 2, 1869, with a mayor–council government. The corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date \"1869\" and a likeness of Chief Sealth in left profile.\n\nSeattle has a history of boom-and-bust cycles, like many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources. Seattle has risen several times economically, then gone into precipitous decline, but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure.\nThe first such boom, covering the early years of the city, rode on the lumber industry. (During this period the road now known as Yesler Way won the nickname \"Skid Road,\" supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to Henry Yesler's sawmill. The later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as \"Skid Row\".) Like much of the American West, Seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management, as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the anti-Chinese riots of 1885–1886. This violence originated with unemployed whites who were determined to drive the Chinese from Seattle (anti-Chinese riots also occurred in Tacoma). In 1900, Asians were 4.2% of the population. Authorities declared martial law and federal troops arrived to put down the disorder.\n\nSeattle had achieved sufficient economic success that when the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 destroyed the central business district, a far grander city-center rapidly emerged in its place. Finance company Washington Mutual, for example, was founded in the immediate wake of the fire. However, the Panic of 1893 hit Seattle hard.\n\nThe second and most dramatic boom resulted from the Klondike Gold Rush, which ended the depression that had begun with the Panic of 1893. In a short time, Seattle became a major transportation center. On July 14, 1897, the \"S.S. Portland\" docked with its famed \"ton of gold,\" and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in Alaska and the Yukon. Few of those working men found lasting wealth. However, it was Seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run. Along with Seattle, other cities like Everett, Tacoma, Port Townsend, Bremerton, and Olympia, all in the Puget Sound region, became competitors for exchange, rather than mother lodes for extraction, of precious metals. The boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century, and funded many new Seattle companies and products. In 1907, 19-year-old James E. Casey borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the American Messenger Company (later UPS). Other Seattle companies founded during this period include Nordstrom and Eddie Bauer. Seattle brought in the Olmsted Brothers landscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards.\nThe Gold Rush era culminated in the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909, which is largely responsible for the layout of today's University of Washington campus.\n\nA shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town. The subsequent retrenchment led to the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the first general strike in the country. A 1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the Maritime Strike of 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles.\n\nThe Great Depression in Seattle affected many minority groups, one being the Asian Pacific Americans; they were subject to racism, loss of property, and failed claims of unemployment due to citizenship status.\n\nSeattle was one of the major cities that benefited from programs such as the WPA, CCC, UCL, and PWA. The workers, mostly men, built roads, parks, dams, schools, railroads, bridges, docks, and even historical and archival record sites and buildings. However, Seattle faced massive unemployment, loss of lumber and construction industries as Los Angeles prevailed as the bigger West Coast city. Seattle had building contracts that rivaled New York City and Chicago, but lost to LA as well. Seattle’s eastern farm land faded due to Oregon’s and the Midwest’s, forcing people into town.\n\nThe famous \"Hooverville\" arose during the Depression, leading to Seattle’s growing homeless population. Stationed outside Seattle, the Hooverville housed thousands of men but very very few children and no women. With work projects close to the city, Hooverville grew and the WPA settled into the city.\n\nA movement by women arose from Seattle during the Depression. Fueled by Eleanor Roosevelt’s book \"It’s Up to the Women\", women pushed for recognition, not just as housewives, but as the backbone to family. Using newspapers and journals \"Working Woman\" and \"The Woman Today\", women pushed to be seen as equal and receive some recognition.\n\nSeattle’s University of Washington was greatly affected during the Depression era. As schools across Washington lost funding and attendance, the UW actually prospered during the time period. While Seattle public schools were influenced by Washington’s superintendent Worth McClure, they still struggled to pay teachers and maintain attendance. The UW, despite academic challenges that plagued the college due to differing views on teaching and learning, focused on growth in student enrollment rather than improving the existing school.\n\nSeattle was also the home base of impresario Alexander Pantages who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies. His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on and became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival John Considine, Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. B. Marcus Priteca, the Scottish-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the \"Pantages\" name; Seattle's surviving Paramount Theatre, on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.\n\nWar work again brought local prosperity during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\"\n\nSeattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington.\n\nAs prosperity began to return in the 1980s, the city was stunned by the Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International District. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT&T Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie \"Sleepless in Seattle\" brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong, but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001.\n\nSeattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies, but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders conference in 1993, as well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge, a sound that had developed in Seattle's independent music scene. Another bid for worldwide attention—hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999—garnered visibility, but not in the way its sponsors desired, as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself. The city was further shaken by the Mardi Gras Riots in 2001, and then literally shaken the following day by the Nisqually earthquake.\n\nAnother boom began as the city emerged from the Great Recession which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill to South Lake Union. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion of almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year and nearly twice as many as were built in 2016. Beginning in 2010, and for the next five years, Seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year, with the growth strongly skewed toward the center of the city, as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent. The city has found itself \"bursting at the seams\", with over 45,000 households spending more than half their income on housing and at least 2,800 people homeless, and with the country's sixth-worst rush hour traffic.\nWith a land area of 83.9 square miles (217.3 km²), Seattle is the northernmost city with at least 500,000 people in the United States, farther north than Canadian cities such as Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal, at about the same latitude as Salzburg, Austria.\n\nThe topography of Seattle is hilly. The city lies on several hills, including Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Magnolia, Denny Hill, and Queen Anne. The Kitsap and the Olympic peninsulas along with the Olympic mountains lie to the west of Puget Sound, while the Cascade Range and Lake Sammamish lie to the east of Lake Washington. The city has over of parkland.\n\nSeattle is located between the saltwater Puget Sound (an arm of the Pacific Ocean) to the west and Lake Washington to the east. The city's chief harbor, Elliott Bay, is part of Puget Sound, which makes the city an oceanic port. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic Mountains on the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the Eastside suburbs, are Lake Sammamish and the Cascade Range. Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound through the Lake Washington Ship Canal (consisting of two man-made canals, Lake Union, and the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks at Salmon Bay, ending in Shilshole Bay on Puget Sound).\n\nThe sea, rivers, forests, lakes, and fields surrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world's few sedentary hunter-gatherer societies. The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing, skiing, bicycling, camping, and hiking year-round.\n\nThe city itself is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, the city is said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but typically include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Delridge, Mount Baker, Seward Park, Washington Park, Broadmoor, Madrona, Phinney Ridge, Sunset Hill, Blue Ridge, Broadview, Laurelhurst, Hawthorne Hills, Maple Leaf, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are all located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) at the mouth of the city's industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant, Maple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt. Baker Ridge, and Highlands/Carkeek/Bitterlake.\n\nNorth of the city center, Lake Washington Ship Canal connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington. It incorporates four natural bodies of water: Lake Union, Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, and Union Bay.\n\nDue to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone. On February 28, 2001, the magnitude 6.8 Nisqually earthquake did significant architectural damage, especially in the Pioneer Square area (built on reclaimed land, as are the Industrial District and part of the city center), but caused only one fatality.\nOther strong quakes occurred on January 26, 1700 (estimated at 9 magnitude), December 14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4), April 13, 1949 (7.1), and April 29, 1965 (6.5). The 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly and one more by heart failure. Although the Seattle Fault passes just south of the city center, neither it nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the city's founding. The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , water (41.16% of the total area).\n\nSeattle has a warm-temperate climate, classified as mediterranean due to its precipitation standard (Köppen: \"Csb\"), although other upgraded classifications like the one of Trewartha define it with an oceanic climate (\"Do\", equivalent to the \"Cfb\" of Köppen), due to its regime of temperature. It has cool, wet winters and mild, relatively dry summers, covering characteristics of both. The city and environs are part of USDA hardiness zone 8b, with isolated coastal pockets falling under 9a.\n\nTemperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent Puget Sound, greater Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington. Thus extreme heat waves are rare in the Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures (below about ). The Seattle area is the most cloudy region of the United States, due in part to frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent Pacific Ocean. Despite having a reputation for frequent rain, Seattle receives less precipitation than many other U.S. cities like Chicago or New York City. However, unlike many other U.S. cities, Seattle has many more \"rain days\", when a very light drizzle falls from the sky for many days.\nIn an average year, at least of precipitation falls on 150 days, more than nearly all U.S. cities east of the Rocky Mountains. It is cloudy 201 days out of the year and partly cloudy 93 days. Official weather and climatic data is collected at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, located about south of downtown in the city of SeaTac, which is at a higher elevation, and records more cloudy days and fewer partly cloudy days per year.\n\nHot temperature extremes are enhanced by dry, compressed wind from the west slopes of the Cascades, while cold temperatures are generated mainly from the Fraser Valley in British Columbia.\n\nFrom 1981 to 2010, the average annual precipitation measured at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport was 37.49 inches (952 mm). Annual precipitation has ranged from in 1952 to in 1950; for water year (October 1 – September 30) precipitation, the range is in 1976–77 to in 1996–97. Due to local variations in microclimate, Seattle also receives significantly lower precipitation than some other locations west of the Cascades. Around to the west, the Hoh Rain Forest in Olympic National Park on the western flank of the Olympic Mountains receives an annual average precipitation of . Sixty miles (95 km) to the south of Seattle, the state capital Olympia, which is out of the Olympic Mountains' rain shadow, receives an annual average precipitation of . The city of Bremerton, about west of downtown Seattle on the other side of the Puget Sound, receives of precipitation annually.\n\nConversely, the northeastern portion of the Olympic Peninsula, which lies east of the Olympic Mountains is located within the Olympic rain shadow and receives significantly less precipitation than its surrounding areas. Prevailing airflow from the west is forced to cool and compress when colliding with the mountain range, resulting in high levels of precipitation within the mountains and its western slopes. Once the airflow reaches the leeward side of the mountains it then lowers and expands resulting in warmer, and significantly dryer air. Sequim, Washington, nicknamed \"Sunny Sequim,\" is located approximately northwest of downtown Seattle and receives just of annual precipitation, more comparable to that of Los Angeles. Oftentimes an area devoid of cloud cover can be seen extending out over the Puget Sound to the north and east of Sequim. On average Sequim observes 127 sunny days per year in addition to 127 days with partial cloud cover. Other areas influenced by the Olympic rain shadow include Port Angeles, Port Townsend, extending as far north as Victoria, British Columbia.\n\nIn November, Seattle averages more rainfall than any other U.S. city of more than 250,000 people; it also ranks highly in winter precipitation. Conversely, the city receives some of the lowest precipitation amounts of any large city from June to September. Seattle is one of the five rainiest major U.S. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation, and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states, along with some cities in the Northeast, Ohio and Michigan. Thunderstorms are rare, as the city reports thunder on just seven days per year. By comparison, Fort Myers, Florida, reports thunder on 93 days per year, Kansas City on 52, and New York City on 25.\n\nSeattle experiences its heaviest rainfall during the months of November, December and January, receiving roughly half of its annual rainfall (by volume) during this period. In late fall and early winter, atmospheric rivers (also known as \"Pineapple Express\" systems), strong frontal systems, and Pacific low pressure systems are common. Light rain & drizzle are the predominant forms of precipitation during the remainder of the year; for instance, on average, less than of rain falls in July and August combined when rain is less common. On occasion, Seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events. One such event occurred on December 2–4, 2007, when sustained hurricane-force winds and widespread heavy rainfall associated with a strong Pineapple Express event occurred in the greater Puget Sound area and the western parts of Washington and Oregon. Precipitation totals exceeded in some areas with winds topping out at along coastal Oregon. It became the second wettest event in Seattle history when a little over of rain fell on Seattle in a 24-hour period. Lack of adaptation to the heavy rain contributed to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage.\n\nAutumn, winter, and early spring are frequently characterized by rain. Winters are cool and wet with December, the coolest month, averaging , with 28 annual days with lows that reach the freezing mark, and 2.0 days where the temperature stays at or below freezing all day; the temperature rarely lowers to . Summers are sunny, dry and warm, with August, the warmest month, with high temperatures averaging , and reaching on 3.1 days per year. In 2015 the city recorded 13 days over 90 °F. The hottest officially recorded temperature was on July 29, 2009; the coldest recorded temperature was on January 31, 1950; the record cold daily maximum is on January 14, 1950, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is the day the official record high was set. The average window for freezing temperatures is November 16 through March 10, allowing a growing season of 250 days.\nSeattle typically receives some snowfall on an annual basis but heavy snow is rare. Average annual snowfall, as measured at Sea-Tac Airport, is . Single calendar-day snowfall of six inches (15 cm) or greater has occurred on only 15 days since 1948, and only once since February 17, 1990, when of snow officially fell at Sea-Tac airport on January 18, 2012. This moderate snow event was officially the 12th snowiest calendar day at the airport since 1948 and snowiest since November 1985. Much of the city of Seattle proper received somewhat lesser snowfall accumulations. Locations to the south of Seattle received more, with Olympia and Chehalis receiving . Another moderate snow event occurred from December 12–25, 2008, when over one foot (30 cm) of snow fell and stuck on much of the roads over those two weeks, when temperatures remained below , causing widespread difficulties in a city not equipped for clearing snow. The largest documented snowstorm occurred from January 5–9, 1880, with snow drifting to in places at the end of the snow event. From January 31 to February 2, 1916, another heavy snow event occurred with of snow on the ground by the time the event was over. With official records dating to 1948, the largest single-day snowfall is on January 13, 1950. Seasonal snowfall has ranged from zero in 1991–92 to in 1968–69, with trace amounts having occurred as recently as 2009–10. The month of January 1950 was particularly severe, bringing of snow, the most of any month along with the aforementioned record cold.\n\nThe Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an important feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur north and south of town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.\n\nOne of many exceptions to Seattle's reputation as a damp location occurs in El Niño years, when marine weather systems track as far south as California and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound area. Since the region's water comes from mountain snow packs during the dry summer months, El Niño winters can not only produce substandard skiing but can result in water rationing and a shortage of hydroelectric power the following summer.\n\nAccording to the 2012-2016 American Community Survey (ACS), the racial makeup of the city was 65.7% Caucasian, 14.1% Asian, 7.0% of African origin,\n6.6% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 0.4% Native American, 0.9% Pacific Islander, 0.2% other races, and 5.6% two or more races.\n\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, Seattle had a population of 608,660 with a racial and ethnic composition as follows:\n\nSeattle's population historically has been predominantly white. The 2010 census showed that Seattle was one of the whitest big cities in the country, although its proportion of white residents has been gradually declining. In 1960, whites comprised 91.6% of the city's population, while in 2010 they comprised 69.5%. According to the 2006–2008 American Community Survey, approximately 78.9% of residents over the age of five spoke only English at home. Those who spoke Asian languages other than Indo-European languages made up 10.2% of the population, Spanish was spoken by 4.5% of the population, speakers of other Indo-European languages made up 3.9%, and speakers of other languages made up 2.5%.\n\nSeattle's foreign-born population grew 40% between the 1990 and 2000 censuses. The Chinese population in the Seattle area has origins in mainland China, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. The earliest Chinese-Americans that came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were almost entirely from Guangdong Province. The Seattle area is also home to a large Vietnamese population of more than 55,000 residents, as well as over 30,000 Somali immigrants. The Seattle-Tacoma area is also home to one of the largest Cambodian communities in the United States, numbering about 19,000 Cambodian Americans, and one of the largest Samoan communities in the mainland U.S., with over 15,000 people having Samoan ancestry. Additionally, the Seattle area had the highest percentage of self-identified mixed-race people of any large metropolitan area in the United States, according to the 2000 United States Census Bureau. According to a 2012 HistoryLink study, Seattle's 98118 ZIP code (in the Columbia City neighborhood) was one of the most diverse ZIP Code Tabulation Areas in the United States.\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, the largest religious groupings are Christians (52%), followed by those of no religion (37%), Hindus (2%), Buddhists (2%), Jews (1%), Muslims (1%) and a variety of other religions have smaller followings. According to the same study by the Pew Research Center, about 34% of Seattleites are Protestant, and 15% professing Roman Catholic beliefs. Meanwhile, 6% of the residents in Seattle call themselves agnostics, while 10% call themselves atheists.\n\nIn 1999, the median income of a city household was $45,736, and the median income for a family was $62,195. Males had a median income of $40,929 versus $35,134 for females. The per capita income for the city was $30,306. 11.8% of the population and 6.9% of families are below the poverty line. Of people living in poverty, 13.8% are under the age of 18 and 10.2% are 65 or older.\n\nIt is estimated that King County has 8,000 homeless people on any given night, and many of those live in Seattle. In September 2005, King County adopted a \"Ten-Year Plan to End Homelessness\", one of the near-term results of which is a shift of funding from homeless shelter beds to permanent housing.\n\nIn recent years, the city has experienced steady population growth, and has been faced with the issue of accommodating more residents. In 2006, after growing by 4,000 citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by 200,000 people by 2040. However, former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60%, or 350,000 people, by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle's single-family housing zoning laws. The Seattle City Council later voted to relax height limits on buildings in the greater part of Downtown, partly with the aim to increase residential density in the city center. As a sign of increasing inner-city growth, the downtown population crested to over 60,000 in 2009, up 77% since 1990.\n\nSeattle also has large lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations. According to a 2006 study by UCLA, 12.9% of city residents polled identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. This was the second-highest proportion of any major U.S. city, behind San Francisco. Greater Seattle also ranked second among major U.S. metropolitan areas, with 6.5% of the population identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. According to 2012 estimates from the United States Census Bureau, Seattle has the highest percentage of same-sex households in the United States, at 2.6 per cent, surpassing San Francisco.\n\nIn addition, Seattle has a relatively high number of people living alone. According to the 2000 U.S. Census interim measurements of 2004, Seattle has the fifth highest proportion of single-person households nationwide among cities of 100,000 or more residents, at 40.8%.\n\nSeattle's economy is driven by a mix of older industrial companies, and \"new economy\" Internet and technology companies, service, design, and clean technology companies. The city's gross metropolitan product (GMP) was $231 billion in 2010, making it the 11th largest metropolitan economy in the United States. The Port of Seattle, which also operates Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, is a major gateway for trade with Asia and cruises to Alaska. It also is the 8th largest port in the United States when measured by container capacity. Its maritime cargo operations merged with the Port of Tacoma in 2015 to form the Northwest Seaport Alliance. Although it was affected by the Great Recession, Seattle has retained a comparatively strong economy. It even remains as a hotbed for start-up businesses, especially in green building and clean technologies. It was ranked as America's No. 1 \"smarter city\" based on its government policies and green economy. In February 2010, the city government committed Seattle to become North America's first \"climate neutral\" city, with a goal of reaching zero net per capita greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\nLarge companies continue to dominate the business landscape. Five companies on Fortune 500's 2017 list of the United States' largest companies (based on total revenue) are headquartered in Seattle: Internet retailer Amazon.com (#12), coffee chain Starbucks (#131), department store Nordstrom (#188), freight forwarder Expeditors International of Washington (#429) and forest products company Weyerhaeuser (#341). Other Fortune 500 companies commonly associated with Seattle are based in nearby Puget Sound cities. Warehouse club chain Costco (#16), the largest retail company in Washington, is based in Issaquah. Microsoft (#28) is located in Redmond. Furthermore, Bellevue is home to truck manufacturer Paccar (#164). Other major companies headquartered in the area include Nintendo of America in Redmond, T-Mobile US in Bellevue, Expedia Inc. in Bellevue, and Providence Health & Services (the state's largest health care system and fifth largest employer) in Renton. The city has a reputation for heavy coffee consumption; coffee companies founded or based in Seattle include Starbucks, Seattle's Best Coffee, and Tully's. There are also many successful independent artisanal espresso roasters and cafés.\n\nBefore moving its headquarters to Chicago, aerospace manufacturer Boeing (#24) was the largest company based in Seattle. Its largest division, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, is still headquartered in nearby Renton. The company also has large aircraft manufacturing plants in Everett and Renton; it remains the largest private employer in the Seattle metropolitan area. In 2006 former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the biotechnology industry. Major redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood is underway in an effort to attract new and established biotech companies to the city, joining biotech companies Corixa (acquired by GlaxoSmithKline), Immunex (now part of Amgen), Trubion, and ZymoGenetics. Vulcan Inc., the holding company of billionaire Paul Allen, is behind most of the development projects in the region. While some see the new development as an economic boon, others have criticized Nickels and the Seattle City Council for pandering to Allen's interests at taxpayers' expense. Also in 2006, \"Expansion Magazine\" ranked Seattle as one of the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation based on climates favorable to business expansion. In 2005, \"Forbes\" ranked Seattle as the most expensive American city for buying a house based on the local income levels. In 2013, however, the magazine ranked Seattle No. 9 on its list of the Best Places for Business and Careers.\n\nOperating a hub at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, Alaska Airlines maintains its headquarters in the city of SeaTac, next to the airport.\n\nSeattle is a hub for global health with the headquarters of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, PATH, Infectious Disease Research Institute, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. In 2015, the Washington Global Health Alliance counted 168 global health organizations in Washington state. Many are headquartered in Seattle. \n\nTwenty of Seattle's neighborhoods host one or more street fairs or parades.\n\nFrom 1869 until 1982, Seattle was known as the \"Queen City\". Seattle's official nickname is the \"Emerald City\", the result of a contest held in 1981; the reference is to the lush evergreen forests of the area. Seattle is also referred to informally as the \"Gateway to Alaska\" for being the nearest major city in the contiguous U.S. to Alaska, \"Rain City\" for its frequent cloudy and rainy weather, and \"Jet City\" from the local influence of Boeing. The city has two official slogans or mottos: \"The City of Flowers\", meant to encourage the planting of flowers to beautify the city, and \"The City of Goodwill\", adopted prior to the 1990 Goodwill Games. Seattle residents are known as \"Seattleites\".\n\nSeattle has been a regional center for the performing arts for many years. The century-old Seattle Symphony Orchestra has won many awards and performs primarily at Benaroya Hall. The Seattle Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet, which perform at McCaw Hall (opened 2003 on the site of the former Seattle Opera House at Seattle Center), are comparably distinguished, with the Opera being particularly known for its performances of the works of Richard Wagner and the PNB School (founded in 1974) ranking as one of the top three ballet training institutions in the United States. The Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestras (SYSO) is the largest symphonic youth organization in the United States. The city also boasts lauded summer and winter chamber music festivals organized by the Seattle Chamber Music Society.\n\nThe 5th Avenue Theatre, built in 1926, stages Broadway-style musical shows featuring both local talent and international stars. Seattle has \"around 100\" theatrical production companies and over two dozen live theatre venues, many of them associated with fringe theatre; Seattle is probably second only to New York for number of equity theaters (28 Seattle theater companies have some sort of Actors' Equity contract).\nIn addition, the 900-seat Romanesque Revival Town Hall on First Hill hosts numerous cultural events, especially lectures and recitals.\n\nBetween 1918 and 1951, there were nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs along Jackson Street, running from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene developed the early careers of Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Bumps Blackwell, Ernestine Anderson, and others.\n\nEarly popular musical acts from the Seattle/Puget Sound area include the collegiate folk group The Brothers Four, vocal group The Fleetwoods, 1960s garage rockers The Wailers and The Sonics, and instrumental surf group The Ventures, some of whom are still active.\n\nSeattle is considered the home of grunge music, having produced artists such as Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Mudhoney, all of whom reached international audiences in the early 1990s. The city is also home to such varied artists as avant-garde jazz musicians Bill Frisell and Wayne Horvitz, hot jazz musician Glenn Crytzer, hip hop artists Sir Mix-a-Lot, Macklemore, Blue Scholars, and Shabazz Palaces, smooth jazz saxophonist Kenny G, classic rock staples Heart and Queensrÿche, and alternative rock bands such as Foo Fighters, Harvey Danger, The Presidents of the United States of America, The Posies, Modest Mouse, Band of Horses, Death Cab for Cutie, and Fleet Foxes. Rock musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Duff McKagan, and Nikki Sixx spent their formative years in Seattle.\n\nThe Seattle-based Sub Pop record company continues to be one of the world's best-known independent/alternative music labels.\n\nOver the years, a number of songs have been written about Seattle.\n\nSeattle annually sends a team of spoken word slammers to the National Poetry Slam and considers itself home to such performance poets as Buddy Wakefield, two-time Individual World Poetry Slam Champ; Anis Mojgani, two-time National Poetry Slam Champ; and Danny Sherrard, 2007 National Poetry Slam Champ and 2008 Individual World Poetry Slam Champ. Seattle also hosted the 2001 national Poetry Slam Tournament. The Seattle Poetry Festival is a biennial poetry festival that (launched first as the Poetry Circus in 1997) has featured local, regional, national, and international names in poetry.\n\nThe city also has movie houses showing both Hollywood productions and works by independent filmmakers. Among these, the Seattle Cinerama stands out as one of only three movie theaters in the world still capable of showing three-panel Cinerama films.\n\nAmong Seattle's prominent annual fairs and festivals are the 24-day Seattle International Film Festival, Northwest Folklife over the Memorial Day weekend, numerous Seafair events throughout July and August (ranging from a Bon Odori celebration to the Seafair Cup hydroplane races), the Bite of Seattle, one of the largest Gay Pride festivals in the United States, and the art and music festival Bumbershoot, which programs music as well as other art and entertainment over the Labor Day weekend. All are typically attended by 100,000 people annually, as are the Seattle Hempfest and two separate Independence Day celebrations.\n\nOther significant events include numerous Native American pow-wows, a Greek Festival hosted by St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church in Montlake, and numerous ethnic festivals (many associated with Festál at Seattle Center).\n\nThere are other annual events, ranging from the Seattle Antiquarian Book Fair & Book Arts Show; an anime convention, Sakura-Con; Penny Arcade Expo, a gaming convention; a two-day, 9,000-rider Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic; and specialized film festivals, such as the Maelstrom International Fantastic Film Festival, the Seattle Asian American Film Festival (formerly known as the Northwest Asian American Film Festival), Children's Film Festival Seattle, Translation: the Seattle Transgender Film Festival, the Seattle Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, Seattle Latino Film Festival, and the Seattle Polish Film Festival.\n\nThe Henry Art Gallery opened in 1927, the first public art museum in Washington. The Seattle Art Museum (SAM) opened in 1933; SAM opened a museum downtown in 1991 (expanded and reopened 2007); since 1991, the 1933 building has been SAM's Seattle Asian Art Museum (SAAM). SAM also operates the Olympic Sculpture Park (opened 2007) on the waterfront north of the downtown piers. The Frye Art Museum is a free museum on First Hill.\n\nRegional history collections are at the Log House Museum in Alki, Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park, the Museum of History and Industry, and the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. Industry collections are at the Center for Wooden Boats and the adjacent Northwest Seaport, the Seattle Metropolitan Police Museum, and the Museum of Flight. Regional ethnic collections include the Nordic Heritage Museum, the Wing Luke Asian Museum, and the Northwest African American Museum. Seattle has artist-run galleries, including ten-year veteran Soil Art Gallery, and the newer Crawl Space Gallery.\n\nThe Seattle Great Wheel, one of the largest Ferris wheels in the US, opened in June 2012 as a new, permanent attraction on the city's waterfront, at Pier 57, next to Downtown Seattle. The city also has many community centers for recreation, including Rainier Beach, Van Asselt, Rainier, and Jefferson south of the Ship Canal and Green Lake, Laurelhurst, Loyal Heights north of the Canal, and Meadowbrook.\n\nWoodland Park Zoo opened as a private menagerie in 1889 but was sold to the city in 1899. The Seattle Aquarium has been open on the downtown waterfront since 1977 (undergoing a renovation in 2006). The Seattle Underground Tour is an exhibit of places that existed before the Great Fire.\n\nSince the middle 1990s, Seattle has experienced significant growth in the cruise industry, especially as a departure point for Alaska cruises. In 2008, a record total of 886,039 cruise passengers passed through the city, surpassing the number for Vancouver, BC, the other major departure point for Alaska cruises.\n\nSeattle has three major men's professional sports teams: the National Football League (NFL)'s Seattle Seahawks, Major League Baseball (MLB)'s Seattle Mariners, and Major League Soccer (MLS)'s Seattle Sounders FC. Other professional sports teams include the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA)'s Seattle Storm, who won the WNBA championship in 2004 and 2010, and the Seattle Reign of the National Women's Soccer League.\n\nThe Seahawks' CenturyLink Field has hosted NFL playoff games in 2006, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015, and 2017. The Seahawks have advanced to the Super Bowl three times: 2005, 2013 and 2014. They defeated the Denver Broncos 43–8 to win their first Super Bowl championship in Super Bowl XLVIII, but lost 24–28 against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX. The Seahawks also held the NFL playoffs at the Kingdome in 1983, 1984 and 2000. The 2000 playoff game was the last game of football of any type and of any sport at The Kingdome.\n\nSeattle Sounders FC has played in Major League Soccer since 2009, sharing CenturyLink Field with the Seahawks, as a continuation of earlier teams in the lower divisions of American soccer. The Sounders have won the MLS Supporters' Shield in 2014 and the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup on four occasions: 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2014. The Sounders won their first MLS Cup after defeating Toronto FC, 5-4 in penalty kicks, in MLS Cup 2016. With the Sounders' first MLS Cup championship in franchise history, the Mariners are the only men's professional sports team in the city without a championship, let alone a championship series appearance.\n\nSeattle's professional sports history began at the start of the 20th century with the PCHA's Seattle Metropolitans, which in 1917 became the first American hockey team to win the Stanley Cup.\nSeattle was also home to a previous Major League Baseball franchise in 1969: the Seattle Pilots. The Pilots relocated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and became the Milwaukee Brewers for the 1970 season.\n\nFrom 1967 to 2008 Seattle was also home to a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise: the Seattle SuperSonics, who were the 1978–79 NBA champions. The SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 2008–09 season.\n\nThe Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held in Seattle twice, first at the Kingdome in 1979 and again at Safeco Field in 2001. That same year, the Seattle Mariners tied the all-time single regular season wins record with 116 wins. The NBA All-Star Game was also held in Seattle twice: the first in 1974 at the Seattle Center Coliseum and the second in 1987 at the Kingdome.\n\nThe Seattle Thunderbirds hockey team plays in the Canadian major-junior Western Hockey League and are based in the Seattle suburb of Kent.\nSeattle also boasts a strong history in collegiate sports. The University of Washington and Seattle University are NCAA Division I schools. The University of Washington's athletic program, nicknamed the Huskies, competes in the Pac-12 Conference, and Seattle University's athletic program, nicknamed the Redhawks, competes in the Western Athletic Conference.\n\nSeattle applied for a new expansion team with the National Hockey League to start by 2020 or later. Seattle plans to renovate KeyArena to use for the possible NHL team. On March 1, 2018, a ticket drive began to gauge interests in season ticket deposits. Oak View reported that their initial goal of 10,000 deposits was surpassed in 12 minutes, and that they received 25,000 deposits in 75 minutes.\n\nSeattle's mild, temperate, marine climate allows year-round outdoor recreation, including walking, cycling, hiking, skiing, snowboarding, kayaking, rock climbing, motor boating, sailing, team sports, and swimming.\n\nIn town, many people walk around Green Lake, through the forests and along the bluffs and beaches of Discovery Park (the largest park in the city) in Magnolia, along the shores of Myrtle Edwards Park on the Downtown waterfront, along the shoreline of Lake Washington at Seward Park, along Alki Beach in West Seattle, or along the Burke-Gilman Trail.\nGas Works Park features the preserved superstructure of a coal gasification plant closed in 1956. Located across Lake Union from downtown, the park provides panoramic views of the Seattle skyline.\n\nAlso popular are hikes and skiing in the nearby Cascade or Olympic Mountains and kayaking and sailing in the waters of Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the Strait of Georgia. In 2005, \"Men's Fitness\" magazine named Seattle the fittest city in the United States.\n\nIn its 2013 ParkScore ranking, the Trust for Public Land reported that Seattle had the tenth best park system among the 50 most populous US cities. ParkScore ranks city park systems by a formula that analyzes acreage, access, and service and investment.\n\nSeattle is a charter city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.\n\nLike some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people).\n\nJenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; , the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.\n\nSeattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats.\n\nIn 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant. For the first time in United States history, an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor in 1991. The majority of the city council is female.\n\nFederally, Seattle is split between two congressional districts. Most of the city is in Washington's 7th congressional district, represented by Democrat Pramila Jayapal, the first Indian-American woman elected to Congress. She succeeded 28-year incumbent and fellow Democrat Jim McDermott. Part of southwestern Seattle is in the 9th District, represented by Democrat Adam Smith.\n\nSeattle is widely considered one of the most socially liberal cities in the United States, even surpassing Portland. In the 2012 U.S. general election, a majority of Seattleites voted to approve Referendum 74 and legalize gay marriage in Washington state. In the same election, an overwhelming majority of Seattleites also voted to approve the legalization of the recreational use of cannabis in the state. Like much of the Pacific Northwest (which has the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of atheism), church attendance, religious belief, and political influence of religious leaders are much lower than in other parts of America.\n\nSeattle also has a thriving alternative press, with the Web-based daily \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", several other online dailies (including \"Publicola\" and \"Crosscut\"), \"The Stranger\" (an alternative, left-leaning weekly), \"Seattle Weekly\", and a number of issue-focused publications, including the nation's two largest online environmental magazines, \"Worldchanging\" and \"Grist.org\".\n\nIn July 2012, Seattle banned plastic shopping bags. In June 2014 the city passed a local ordinance to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour on a staged basis from 2015 to 2021. When fully implemented the $15 hourly rate will be the highest minimum wage in the nation.\n\nOn October 6, 2014, Seattle officially replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day, honoring Seattle's Native American community and acknowledging the controversies surrounding the legacy of Christopher Columbus.\n\nOn May 9, 2017, Mayor Murray announced he would not seek re-election following a lawsuit alleging sexual abuse of several teenaged boys in the 1980s. Murray resigned as mayor on September 12, 2017, effective at 5p.m. on September 13, 2017, hours after The Seattle Times reported a fifth allegation of child sexual abuse.\n\nIn July 2017, the Seattle City Council unanimously approved an income tax on Seattle residents, making the city the only one in the state with an income tax. The new income tax was ruled unconstitutional in a ruling by King County Superior Court and thus was not allowed to proceed. The city is expected to appeal this ruling.\n\nOf the city's population over the age of 25, 53.8% (vs. a national average of 27.4%) hold a bachelor's degree or higher, and 91.9% (vs. 84.5% nationally) have a high school diploma or equivalent. A 2008 United States Census Bureau survey showed that Seattle had the highest percentage of college and university graduates of any major U.S. city. The city was listed as the most literate of the country's 69 largest cities in 2005 and 2006, the second most literate in 2007 and the most literate in 2008 in studies conducted by Central Connecticut State University.\n\nSeattle Public Schools desegregated without a court order but continue to struggle to achieve racial balance in a somewhat ethnically divided city (the south part of town having more ethnic minorities than the north). In 2007, Seattle's racial tie-breaking system was struck down by the United States Supreme Court, but the ruling left the door open for desegregation formulae based on other indicators (e.g., income or socioeconomic class).\n\nThe public school system is supplemented by a moderate number of private schools: five of the private high schools are Catholic, one is Lutheran, and six are secular.\n\nSeattle is home to the University of Washington, as well as the institution's professional and continuing education unit, the University of Washington Educational Outreach. The 2017 U.S. News & World Report ranked the University of Washington at #11 in the world, tied with Johns Hopkins University. The UW receives more federal research and development funding than any public institution. Over the last 10 years, it has also produced more Peace Corps volunteers than any other U.S. university. Seattle also has a number of smaller private universities including Seattle University and Seattle Pacific University, the former a Jesuit Catholic institution, the latter Free Methodist; universities aimed at the working adult, like City University and Antioch University; colleges within the Seattle Colleges District system, comprising North, Central, and South; seminaries, including Western Seminary and a number of arts colleges, such as Cornish College of the Arts, Pratt Fine Arts Center, and The Art Institute of Seattle. In 2001, \"Time\" magazine selected Seattle Central Community College as community college of the year, stating the school \"pushes diverse students to work together in small teams\".\n\n, Seattle has one major daily newspaper, \"The Seattle Times\". The \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", known as the \"P-I\", published a daily newspaper from 1863 to March 17, 2009, before switching to a strictly on-line publication. There is also the \"Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce\", and the University of Washington publishes \"The Daily\", a student-run publication, when school is in session. The most prominent weeklies are the \"Seattle Weekly\" and \"The Stranger\"; both consider themselves \"alternative\" papers. The weekly LGBT newspaper is the \"Seattle Gay News\". \"Real Change\" is a weekly street newspaper that is sold mainly by homeless persons as an alternative to panhandling. There are also several ethnic newspapers, including \"The Facts\", \"Northwest Asian Weekly\" and the \"International Examiner\", and numerous neighborhood newspapers.\n\nSeattle is also well served by television and radio, with all major U.S. networks represented, along with at least five other English-language stations and two Spanish-language stations. Seattle cable viewers also receive CBUT 2 (CBC) from Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nNon-commercial radio stations include NPR affiliates KUOW-FM 94.9 and KNKX 88.5 (Tacoma), as well as classical music station KING-FM 98.1. Other non-commercial stations include KEXP-FM 90.3 (affiliated with the UW), community radio KBCS-FM 91.3 (affiliated with Bellevue College), and high school radio KNHC-FM 89.5, which broadcasts an electronic dance music radio format and is owned by the public school system and operated by students of Nathan Hale High School. Many Seattle radio stations are also available through Internet radio, with KEXP in particular being a pioneer of Internet radio. Seattle also has numerous commercial radio stations. In a March 2012 report by the consumer research firm Arbitron, the top FM stations were KRWM (adult contemporary format), KIRO-FM (news/talk), and KISW (active rock) while the top AM stations were KOMO (AM) (all news), KJR (AM) (all sports), KIRO (AM) (all sports).\n\nSeattle-based online magazines Worldchanging and Grist.org were two of the \"Top Green Websites\" in 2007 according to TIME.\n\nSeattle also has many online news media websites. The two largest are \"The Seattle Times\" and the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\".\n\nThe University of Washington is consistently ranked among the country's top leading institutions in medical research, earning special merits for programs in neurology and neurosurgery. Seattle has seen local developments of modern paramedic services with the establishment of Medic One in 1970. In 1974, a \"60 Minutes\" story on the success of the then four-year-old Medic One paramedic system called Seattle \"the best place in the world to have a heart attack\".\n\nThree of Seattle's largest medical centers are located on First Hill. Harborview Medical Center, the public county hospital, is the only Level I trauma hospital in a region that includes Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. Virginia Mason Medical Center and Swedish Medical Center's two largest campuses are also located in this part of Seattle, including the Virginia Mason Hospital. This concentration of hospitals resulted in the neighborhood's nickname \"Pill Hill\".\n\nLocated in the Laurelhurst neighborhood, Seattle Children's, formerly Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, is the pediatric referral center for Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has a campus in the Eastlake neighborhood. The University District is home to the University of Washington Medical Center which, along with Harborview, is operated by the University of Washington. Seattle is also served by a Veterans Affairs hospital on Beacon Hill, a third campus of Swedish in Ballard, and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center near Northgate Mall.\n\nThe first streetcars appeared in 1889 and were instrumental in the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle. Tacoma–Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett–Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the Seattle trolleybus system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941. This left an extensive network of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region.\nKing County Metro provides frequent stop bus service within the city and surrounding county, as well as the South Lake Union Streetcar line and the First Hill Streetcar line. Seattle is one of the few cities in North America whose bus fleet includes electric trolleybuses. Sound Transit provides an express bus service within the metropolitan area, two Sounder commuter rail lines between the suburbs and downtown, and its Central Link light rail line between the University of Washington and Angle Lake. Washington State Ferries, which manages the largest network of ferries in the United States and third largest in the world, connects Seattle to Bainbridge and Vashon Islands in Puget Sound and to Bremerton and Southworth on the Kitsap Peninsula.\nAccording to the 2007 American Community Survey, 18.6% of Seattle residents used one of the three public transit systems that serve the city, giving it the highest transit ridership of all major cities without heavy or light rail prior to the completion of Sound Transit's Central Link line. The city has also been described by Bert Sperling as the fourth most walkable U.S. city and by Walk Score as the sixth most walkable of the fifty largest U.S. cities.\n\nSeattle–Tacoma International Airport, locally known as Sea-Tac Airport and located just south in the neighboring city of SeaTac, is operated by the Port of Seattle and provides commercial air service to destinations throughout the world. Closer to downtown, Boeing Field is used for general aviation, cargo flights, and testing/delivery of Boeing airliners.\nThe main mode of transportation, however, relies on Seattle's streets, which are laid out in a cardinal directions grid pattern, except in the central business district where early city leaders Arthur Denny and Carson Boren insisted on orienting their plats relative to the shoreline rather than to true North. Only two roads, Interstate 5 and State Route 99 (both limited-access highways), run uninterrupted through the city from north to south. State Route 99 runs through downtown Seattle on the Alaskan Way Viaduct, which was built in 1953. However, due to damage sustained during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake the viaduct will be replaced by a tunnel. The Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel was originally scheduled to be completed in December 2015 at a cost of US$4.25 billion. Unfortunately, due to issues with the worlds largest tunnel boring machine (TBM), which is nicknamed \"Bertha\" and is in diameter, the projected date of completion has been pushed back to fall 2018 (with tolling set to begin in 2019). Seattle has the 8th worst traffic congestion of all American cities, and is 10th among all North American cities.\n\nThe city has started moving away from the automobile and towards mass transit. From 2004 to 2009, the annual number of unlinked public transportation trips increased by approximately 21%. In 2006, voters in King County passed proposition 2 (Transit Now) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five bus rapid transit lines called RapidRide. After rejecting a roads and transit measure in 2007, Seattle-area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase ST Express bus service, extend the Link light rail system, and expand and improve Sounder commuter rail service. A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea-Tac Airport began service on December 19, 2009, giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations within the city limits. An extension north to the University of Washington opened on March 19, 2016; and further extensions are planned to reach Lynnwood to the north, Des Moines to the south, and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2023. Voters in the Puget Sound region approved an additional tax increase in November 2016 to expand light rail to West Seattle and Ballard as well as Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah.\n\nWater and electric power are municipal services, provided by Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle City Light respectively. Other utility companies serving Seattle include Puget Sound Energy (natural gas, electricity); Seattle Steam Company (steam); Waste Management, Inc and CleanScapes, Inc. (curbside recycling and solid waste removal); CenturyLink, Frontier Communications, Wave Broadband, and Comcast (telecommunications and television).\n\nAbout 90% of Seattle's electricity is produced using hydropower. Less than 2% of electricity is produced using fossil fuels.\n\nSeattle is partnered with:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28296", "title": "Short story", "text": "Short story\n\nA short story is a piece of prose fiction that typically can be read in one sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents, with the intent of evoking a \"single effect\" or mood, however there are many exceptions to this.\n\nA dictionary definition is \"an invented prose narrative shorter than a novel usually dealing with a few characters and aiming at unity of effect and often concentrating on the creation of mood rather than plot.\"\n\nThe short story is a crafted form in its own right. Short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components as in a novel, but typically to a lesser degree. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel or novella (a shorter novel), authors generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.\n\nShort story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form. They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed formation.\n\nShort stories have deep roots and the power of short fiction has been recognised in modern society for hundreds of years. The short form is, conceivably, more natural to us than longer forms. We are drawn to short stories as the well-told story, and as William Boyd, the award-winning British author and short story writer has said:\"[short stories] seem to answer something very deep in our nature as if, for the duration of its telling, something special has been created, some essence of our experience extrapolated, some temporary sense has been made of our common, turbulent journey towards the grave and oblivion\".In terms of length, word count is typically anywhere from 1,000 to 4,000 for short stories, however some have 20,000 words and are still classed as short stories. Stories of fewer than 1,000 words are sometimes referred to as \"short short stories\", or \"flash fiction\".\n\n run into the thousands.\n\nGlobal sales of short story fiction are very strong. In the UK sales jumped 45 per cent in 2017, driven by collections from international names such as Alice Munro, new writers to the genre such as Tom Hanks, and the revival of short story salons, such as those held by short fiction company, Pin Drop Studio.\n\nMore than 690,000 short stories and anthologies were sold in the UK in 2017, generating £5.88 million, the genre’s highest sales since 2010.\n\nIn 2012 Pin Drop Studio launched a short story salon held regularly in London and other major cities. Short story writers who have appeared at the salon to read their short stories to a live audience include Ben Okri, Lionel Shriver, Elizabeth Day, A.L. Kennedy, Will Self, William Boyd, Graham Swift, David Nicholls, Will Self, Sebastian Faulks, Julian Barnes, Evie Wylde and Claire Fuller.\n\nProminent short story awards such as The Sunday Times Short Story Award and the Pin Drop Studio Short Story Award, attract hundreds of entries each year. Published and non-published writers take part, sending their stories from all corners of the world.\n\nAlice Munro, \"master of the contemporary short story\" according to her citation for the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature, said she hopes the award would bring readership for the short story in general.\n\nShort stories are sometimes adapted for radio, TV and film:\n\nDetermining what exactly separates a short story from longer fictional formats is problematic. A classic definition of a short story is that one should be able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made in Edgar Allan Poe's essay \"The Philosophy of Composition\" (1846).\n\nInterpreting this standard nowadays is problematic, because the expected length of \"one sitting\" may now be briefer than it was in Poe's era.\n\nShort stories have no set length. In terms of word count there is no official demarcation between an anecdote, a short story, and a novel. Rather, the form's parameters are given by the rhetorical and practical context in which a given story is produced and considered, so that what constitutes a short story may differ between genres, countries, eras, and commentators. Like the novel, the short story's predominant shape reflects the demands of the available markets for publication, and the evolution of the form seems closely tied to the evolution of the publishing industry and the submission guidelines of its constituent houses.\n\nAs a point of reference for the genre writer, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America define short story length in the Nebula Awards for science fiction submission guidelines as having a word count of fewer than 7,500 words.\n\nLonger stories that cannot be called novels are sometimes considered \"novellas\" or novelettes and, like short stories, may be collected into the more marketable form of \"collections\", often containing previously unpublished stories. Sometimes, authors who do not have the time or money to write a novella or novel decide to write short stories instead, working out a deal with a popular website or magazine to publish them for profit.\n\nEmerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization.\n\nWith the rise of the realistic novel, the short story evolved in a parallel tradition, with some of its first distinctive examples in the tales of E.T.A. Hoffmann. The character of the form developed particularly with authors known for their short fiction, either by choice (they wrote nothing else) or by critical regard, which acknowledged the focus and craft required in the short form. An example is Jorge Luis Borges, who won American fame with \"The Garden of Forking Paths\", published in the August 1948 \"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine\". Another example is O. Henry (author of \"Gift of the Magi\"), for whom the O. Henry Award is named. Other of his most popular, inventive and most often reprinted stories (among over 600) include: \"A Municipal Report\", \"An Unfinished Story\", \"A Blackjack Barginer\", \"A Lickpenny Lover\", \"Mammon and the Archer\", \"Two Thanksgiving Day Gentlemen\", \"The Last Leaf\". American examples include: Jack London, Ambrose Bierce, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, John Cheever, and Raymond Carver. Science fiction short story with a special poetic touch was a genre developed with great popular success by Ray Bradbury.\nThe genre of the short story was often neglected until the second half of the 19th century.\n\nThe evolution of printing technologies and periodical editions were among the factors contributing to the increasing importance of short story publications. Pioneering role in founding the rules of the genre in the Western canon include, among others, Rudyard Kipling (United Kingdom), Anton Chekhov (Russia), Guy de Maupassant (France), Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera (Mexico) and Rubén Darío (Nicaragua).\n\nAn important theoretical example for storytelling analysis is provided by Walter Benjamin in his illuminated essay \"The Storyteller\" where he argues about the decline of storytelling art and the incommunicability of experiences in the modern world. Oscar Wilde's essay \"The Decay of Lying\" and Henry James's \"The Art of Fiction\" are also partly related with this subject.\n\nShort stories date back to oral storytelling traditions which originally produced epics such as Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\". Oral narratives were often told in the form of rhyming or rhythmic verse, often including recurring sections or, in the case of Homer, \"Homeric epithets\". Such stylistic devices often acted as mnemonics for easier recall, rendition and adaptation of the story. Short sections of verse might focus on individual narratives that could be told at one sitting. The overall arc of the tale would emerge only through the telling of multiple such sections.\n\nThe other ancient form of short story, the anecdote, was popular under the Roman Empire. Anecdotes functioned as a sort of parable, a brief realistic narrative that embodies a point. Many surviving Roman anecdotes were collected in the 13th or 14th century as the \"Gesta Romanorum\". Anecdotes remained popular in Europe well into the 18th century, when the fictional anecdotal letters of Sir Roger de Coverley were published.\n\nIn Europe, the oral story-telling tradition began to develop into written stories in the early 14th century, most notably with Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" and Giovanni Boccaccio's \"Decameron\". Both of these books are composed of individual short stories (which range from farce or humorous anecdotes to well-crafted literary fictions) set within a larger narrative story (a frame story), although the frame-tale device was not adopted by all writers. At the end of the 16th century, some of the most popular short stories in Europe were the darkly tragic \"novella\" of Matteo Bandello (especially in their French translation).\n\nThe mid 17th century in France saw the development of a refined short novel, the \"nouvelle\", by such authors as Madame de Lafayette. In the 1690s, traditional fairy tales began to be published (one of the most famous collections was by Charles Perrault). The appearance of Antoine Galland's first modern translation of the \"Thousand and One Nights\" (or \"Arabian Nights\") (from 1704; another translation appeared in 1710–12) would have an enormous influence on the 18th-century European short stories of Voltaire, Diderot and others.\n\nThere are early examples of short stories published separately between 1790 and 1810, but the first true collections of short stories appeared between 1810 and 1830 in several countries around the same period.\n\nThe first short stories in the United Kingdom were gothic tales like Richard Cumberland's \"remarkable narrative\" \"The Poisoner of Montremos\" (1791). Great novelists like Sir Walter Scott and Charles Dickens also wrote some short stories.\n\nOne of the earliest short stories in the United States was Charles Brockden Brown's \"Somnambulism\" from 1805. Washington Irving wrote mysterious tales including \"Rip van Winkle\" (1819) and \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" (1820). Nathaniel Hawthorne published the first part of his \"Twice-Told Tales\" in 1837. Edgar Allan Poe wrote his tales of mystery\nand imagination between 1832 and 1849. Classic stories are \"The Fall of the House of Usher\", \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", \"The Cask of Amontillado\", \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", and the first detective story, \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\". In \"The Philosophy of Composition\" (1846) Poe argued that a literary work should be short enough for a reader to finish in one sitting.\n\nIn Germany, the first collection of short stories was by Heinrich von Kleist in 1810 and 1811. The Brothers Grimm published their first volume of collected fairy tales in 1812. E.T.A. Hoffmann followed with his own original fantasy tales, of which \"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King\" (1816) is the most famous.\n\nIn France, Prosper Mérimée wrote \"Mateo Falcone\" in 1829.\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, the growth of print magazines and journals created a strong demand for short fiction of between 3,000 and 15,000 words.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Thomas Hardy wrote dozens of short stories, including \"The Three Strangers\" (1883), \"A Mere Interlude\" (1885) and \"Barbara of the House of Grebe\" (1890). Rudyard Kipling published short story collections for grown-ups, e.g. \"Plain Tales from the Hills\" (1888), as well as for children, e.g. \"The Jungle Book\" (1894). In 1892 Arthur Conan Doyle brought the detective story to a new height with \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\". H.G. Wells wrote his first science fiction stories in the 1880s. One of his best known is \"The Country of the Blind\" (1904).\n\nIn the United States, Herman Melville published his story collection \"The Piazza Tales\" in 1856. \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\" was the title story of Mark Twain's first book one year later. In 1884, Brander Matthews, the first American professor of dramatic literature, published \"The Philosophy of the Short-Story\". At that same year, Matthews was the first one to name the emerging genre \"short story\". Another theorist of narrative fiction was Henry James. James wrote a lot of short stories himself, including \"The Real Thing\" (1892), \"Maud-Evelyn\" and \"The Beast in the Jungle\" (1903). In the 1890s Kate Chopin published short stories in several magazines.\n\nThe most prolific French author of short stories was Guy de Maupassant. Stories like \"Boule de Suif\" (\"Ball of Fat\", 1880) and \"L'Inutile Beauté\" (\"The Useless Beauty\", 1890) are good examples of French realism.\n\nIn Russia, Ivan Turgenev gained recognition with his story collection \"A Sportsman's Sketches\". Nikolai Leskov created his first short stories in the 1860s. Late in his life Fyodor Dostoyevski wrote \"The Meek One\" (1876) and \"The Dream of a Ridiculous Man\" (1877), two stories with great psychological and philosophical depth. Leo Tolstoy handled ethical questions in his short stories, for example in \"Ivan the Fool\" (1885), \"How Much Land Does a Man Need?\" (1886) and \"Alyosha the Pot\" (1905). The greatest specialist of the Russian short story, however, was Anton Chekhov. Classic examples of his realistic prose are \"The Bet\" (1889), \"Ward No. 6\" (1892), and \"The Lady with the Dog\" (1899). Maxim Gorky's best known short story is \"Twenty-six Men and a Girl\" (1899).\n\nThe prolific Indian author of short stories Munshi Premchand, pioneered the genre in the Hindustani language, writing a substantial body of short stories and novels in a style characterized by realism and an unsentimental and authentic introspection into the complexities of Indian society. Premchand's work, including his over 200 short stories (such as the story \"Lottery\") and his novel Godaan remain substantial works.\n\nA master of the short story, the Urdu language writer Saadat Hasan Manto, is revered for his exceptional depth, irony and sardonic humour. The author of some 250 short stories, radio plays, essays, reminiscences and a novel, Manto is widely admired for his analyses of violence, bigotry, prejudice and the relationships between reason and unreason. Combining realism with surrealism and irony, Manto's works such as the celebrated short story Toba Tek Singh are aesthetic masterpieces which continue to give profound insight into the nature of human loss, violence and devastation.\n\nIn India, Rabindranath Tagore published short stories, on the lives of the poor and oppressed such as peasants, women and villagers under colonial misrule and exploitation.\n\nIn Poland, Bolesław Prus was the most important author of short stories. In 1888 he wrote \"A Legend of Old Egypt\".\n\nMachado de Assis, one of the majors novelist from Brazil was the most important short story writer from his country at the time, under influences (among others) of Xavier de Maistre, Lawrence Sterne, Guy de Maupassant. In the end of the 19th century the writer João do Rio became popular by short stories about the bohemianism. Writing about the former slaves, and very ironical about nationalism, Lima Barreto died almost forgotten, but became very popular in the 20th century.\n\nIn Portuguese literature, the major names of the time are Almeida Garrett and the historian and novelist Alexandre Herculano. Still influential, Eça de Queiroz produced some short stories with a style influenced by Émile Zola, Balzac and Dickens.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, periodicals like \"The Strand Magazine\" and \"Story-Teller\" contributed to the popularity of the short story. Hector Hugh Munro (1870–1916), also known by his pen name of Saki, wrote satirical short stories about Edwardian England. W. Somerset Maugham, who wrote over a hundred short stories, was one of the most popular authors of his time. P.G. Wodehouse published his first collection of comical stories about valet Jeeves in 1917. Many detective stories were written by G.K. Chesterton, Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. Short stories by Virginia Woolf are \"Kew Gardens\" (1919) and \"Solid Objects,\" about a politician with mental problems. Graham Greene wrote his Twenty-One Stories between 1929 and 1954. A specialist of the short story was V.S. Pritchett, whose first collection appeared in 1932. Arthur C. Clarke published his first science fiction story, \"Travel by Wire!\" in 1937. Evelyn Waugh, Muriel Spark and L.P. Hartley were other popular British storytellers whose career started in this period.\n\nIn Ireland, James Joyce published his short story collection \"Dubliners\" in 1914. These stories, written in a more accessible style than his later novels, are based on careful observation of the inhabitants of his birth city.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, a number of high-profile American magazines such as \"The Atlantic Monthly\", \"Harper's Magazine\", \"The New Yorker\", \"Scribner's\", \"The Saturday Evening Post\", \"Esquire\", and \"The Bookman\" published short stories in each issue. The demand for quality short stories was so great and the money paid for such so well that F. Scott Fitzgerald repeatedly turned to short-story (as Matthews preferred to write it) writing to pay his numerous debts. His first collection \"Flappers and Philosophers\" appeared in book form in 1920. William Faulkner wrote over one hundred short stories. \"Go Down, Moses\", a collection of seven stories, appeared in 1941. Ernest Hemingway's concise writing style was perfectly fit for shorter fiction. Stories like \"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place\" (1926), \"Hills Like White Elephants\" (1927) and \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\" (1936) are only a few pages long, but carefully crafted. Dorothy Parker's bittersweet story \"Big Blonde\" debuted in 1929. A popular science fiction story is \"Nightfall\" by Isaac Asimov.\n\nKatherine Mansfield from New Zealand wrote many short stories between 1912 and her death in 1923. \"The Doll's House\" (1922) treats the topic of social inequity.\n\nTwo important authors of short stories in the German language were Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. In 1922 the latter wrote \"A Hunger Artist\", about a man who fasts for several days.\n\nRyūnosuke Akutagawa (1892–1927) is called the Father of the Japanese short story.\n\nIn Brazil, the most famous modern short story writer is Mário de Andrade. At the time, Paulistan writer António de Alcantâra Machado became very popular from his collection of short stories titled, \"Brás, Bexiga e Barra Funda\" (1928), about several Italian neighborhoods, but now he is mostly read in just São Paulo. Also, novelist Graciliano Ramos and poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade have significant short story works.\n\nPortuguese writers like Mário de Sá-Carneiro, Florbela Espanca and Fernando Pessoa wrote well-known short stories, although their major genre was poetry.\n\nThe period following World War II saw a great flowering of literary short fiction in the United States. \"The New Yorker\" continued to publish the works of the form's leading mid-century practitioners, including Shirley Jackson, whose story, \"The Lottery\", published in 1948, elicited the strongest response in the magazine's history to that time. Other frequent contributors during the last 1940s included John Cheever, John Steinbeck, Jean Stafford, and Eudora Welty. J.D. Salinger's \"Nine Stories\" (1953) experimented with point of view and voice, while Flannery O'Connor's story \"A Good Man is Hard to Find\" (1955) reinvigorated the Southern Gothic style. Cultural and social identity played a considerable role in much of the short fiction of the 1960s. Philip Roth and Grace Paley cultivated distinctive Jewish-American voices. Tillie Olsen's \"I Stand Here Ironing\" (1961) adopted a consciously feminist perspective. James Baldwin's collection \"Going to Meet the Man\" (1965) told stories of African-American life. Frank O'Connor's \"The Lonely Voice\", an exploration of the short story, appeared in 1963. Wallace Stegner's short stories are primarily set in the American West. Stephen King published many short stories in men's magazines in the 1960s and after. The 1970s saw the rise of the postmodern short story in the works of Donald Barthelme and John Barth. Traditionalists including John Updike and Joyce Carol Oates maintained significant influence on the form. Minimalism gained widespread influence in the 1980s, most notably in the work of Raymond Carver and Ann Beattie.\n\nCanadian short story writers include Alice Munro, Mavis Gallant, and Lynn Coady.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Daphne du Maurier wrote suspense stories like \"The Birds\" (1952) and \"Don't Look Now\" (1971). Roald Dahl was the master of the twist-in-the-tale. Short story collections like \"Lamb to the Slaughter\" (1953) and \"Kiss Kiss\" (1960) illustrate his dark humour.\n\nIn Italy, Italo Calvino published the short story collection \"Marcovaldo\", about a poor man in a city, in 1963.\n\nIn Brazil, the short story became popular among female writers like Clarice Lispector, Lygia Fagundes Telles, Adélia Prado, who wrote about their society from a feminine viewpoint, although the genre has great male writers like Dalton Trevisan, Autran Dourado Moacyr Scliar and Carlos Heitor Cony too. Also, writing about poverty and the favelas, João Antonio became a well known writer. Other post-modern short fiction authors include writers Hilda Hilst and Caio Fernando Abreu. Detective literature was led by Rubem Fonseca. It is also necessary to mention João Guimarães Rosa, wrote short stories in the book \"Sagarana\" using a complex, experimental language based on tales of oral traditional.\n\nPortuguese writers like Virgílo Ferreira, Fernando Goncalves Namora and Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen are among the most influential short story writers from 20th-century Portuguese language literature. Manuel da Silva Ramos is one of the most well-known names of postmodernism in the country. Nobel Prize-winner José Saramago published few short stories, but became popular from his novels.\n\nThe Angolan writer José Luandino Vieira is one of the most well-known writers from his country and has several short stories. José Eduardo Agualusa is also increasingly read in Portuguese-speaking countries.\n\nMozambican Mia Couto is a widely known writer of post modern prose, and he is read even in non-Portuguese speaking countries. Other Mozambican writers such as Suleiman Cassamo, Paulina Chiziane and Eduardo White are gaining popularity with Portuguese-speakers too.\n\nThe Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges is one of the most famous writers of short stories in the Spanish language. \"The Library of Babel\" (1941) and \"The Aleph\" (1945) handle difficult subjects like infinity. Two of the most representative writers of the Magical realism genre are also widely known Argentinian short story writers: Adolfo Bioy Casares and Julio Cortázar.\n\nThe Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos Onetti is known as one of the most important magical realist writer from Latin America.\n\nIn Colombia, the Nobel prize laureate author Gabriel Garcia Marquez is the main novelist and short story writer, known by his magical realist stories and his defense of the Communist Party in his country.\n\nThe Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, also a Nobel prize winner, has significant short story works.\n\nThe Egyptian Nobel Prize-winner Naguib Mafouz is the most well-known author from his country, but has only a few short stories.\n\nJapanese world-known short story writers include Kenzaburō Ōe (Nobel prize winner of 1994), Yukio Mishima and Haruki Murakami.\n\nMulti-awarded Philippine writer Peter Solis Nery is one of the most famous writers of short stories in Hiligaynon language. His stories \"Lirio\" (1998), \"Candido\" (2007), \"Donato Bugtot\" (2011), and \"Si Padre Olan kag ang Dios\" (2013) are all gold prize winners at the Palanca Awards of Philippine Literature.\n\nAs a concentrated, concise form of narrative and descriptive prose fiction, the short story has been theorized through the traditional elements of dramatic structure: exposition (the introduction of setting, situation and main characters), complication (the event that introduces the conflict), rising action, crisis (the decisive moment for the protagonist and his commitment to a course of action), climax (the point of highest interest in terms of the conflict and the point with the most action) and resolution (the point when the conflict is resolved). Because of their length, short stories may or may not follow this pattern. For example, modern short stories only occasionally have an exposition, more typically beginning in the middle of the action (\"in medias res\"). As with longer stories, plots of short stories also have a climax, crisis, or turning point. However, the endings of many short stories are abrupt and open and may or may not have a moral or practical lesson. As with any art form, the exact characteristics of a short story will vary by creator.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "615724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=615724", "title": "Subjectivity", "text": "Subjectivity\n\nSubjectivity is a central philosophical concept, related to consciousness, agency, personhood, reality, and truth, which has been variously defined by sources. Three common definitions include that subjectivity is the quality or condition of:\nThese various definitions of subjectivity are sometimes joined together in philosophy. The term is most commonly used as an explanation for that which influences, informs, and biases people's judgments about truth or reality; it is the collection of the perceptions, experiences, expectations, personal or cultural understanding, and beliefs specific to a person. \n\nSubjectivity is contrasted to the philosophy of objectivity, which is described as a view of truth or reality that is free of any individual's biases, interpretations, feelings, and imaginings. \n\nThe rise of the notion of subjectivity has its philosophical roots in the thinking of Descartes and Kant, and its articulation throughout the modern era has depended on the understanding of what constitutes an individual. There have been various interpretations of such concepts as the self and the soul, and the identity or self-consciousness which lies at the root of the notion of subjectivity.\n\nSubjectivity is, for instance, frequently the implicit topic of existentialism, Sartre as one of its main proponents emphasizing subjectivity in his phenomenology. Unlike his colleague Merleau-Ponty, Sartre believed that, even within the material force of human society, the ego was an essentially transcendent being- posited, for instance, in his opus \"Being and Nothingness\" through his arguments about the 'being-for-others' and the 'for-itself' (i.e., an objective and subjective human being).\n\nSubjectivity is an inherently social mode that comes about through innumerable interactions within society. As much as subjectivity is a process of individuation, it is equally a process of socialization, the individual never being isolated in a self-contained environment, but endlessly engaging in interaction with the surrounding world.\nCulture is a living totality of the subjectivity of any given society constantly undergoing transformation. Subjectivity is both shaped by it and shapes it in turn, but also by other things like the economy, political institutions, communities, as well as the natural world.\n\nThough the boundaries of societies and their cultures are indefinable and arbitrary, the subjectivity inherent in each one is palatable and can be recognized as distinct from others. Subjectivity is in part a particular experience or organization of reality, which includes how one views and interacts with humanity, objects, consciousness, and nature, so the difference between different cultures brings about an alternate experience of existence that forms life in a different manner. A common effect on an individual of this disjunction between subjectivities is culture shock, where the subjectivity of the other culture is considered alien and possibly incomprehensible or even hostile.\n\nPolitical subjectivity is an emerging concept in social sciences and humanities. Political subjectivity is a reference to the deep embeddedness of subjectivity in the socially intertwined systems of power and meaning. \"Politicality,\" writes Sadeq Rahimi in \"Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity\", \"is not an added aspect of the subject, but indeed the mode of being of the subject, that is, precisely what the subject \"is\".\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37670762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37670762", "title": "The Bog People", "text": "The Bog People\n\nThe Bog People: Iron-Age Man Preserved is an archaeological study of the bog bodies of Northern Europe written by the Danish archaeologist P.V. Glob. First published in 1965 by Gyldendal under the Danish title of \"Mosefolket: Jernalderens Mennesker bevaret i 2000 År\", it was translated into English by the English archaeologist Rupert Bruce-Mitford and published by Faber and Faber in 1969. In 1966 it was translated into German by Thyra Dohrenburg and published by Winkler Werlag Munich under the title \"Die Schläfer im Moor\" (English: \"The Sleepers in the Bog\").\n\n\"The Bog People\" is divided into six chapters. The first is devoted to Tollund Man, and the second to Grauballe Man, two of the best known Iron Age bog bodies to have been discovered in Jutland, Denmark. The third and fourth chapters are devoted to the wider context of bog bodies first in Denmark and then in other parts of Europe. The final two chapters are devoted to a wider exposition of life and death in Iron Age Denmark.\n\nGlob's book received positive reviews from both Barry Cunliffe in \"Nature\" and Ralph M. Rowlett in \"American Anthropologist\". They praised Glob's arguments as well as his writing style and use of illustrations, alongside Bruce-Mitford's translation. In subsequent decades, it has received both praise and criticism from specialists in the field, who have lauded the publicity which it brought to the subject, but rejected many of Glob's conclusions as being based on insufficient evidence.\n\nChapter one, \"The Tollund Man\", is devoted to the bog body of the same name that was discovered in 1950 in Tollund Fell, Bjaeldskov Dal in Jutland, Denmark. Glob discusses the excavation of the corpse, and his own personal involvement with the operation. Outlining the find's removal to the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, he then outlines the manner in which the head was conserved for public display at the Silkeborg Museum. Alongside this he also discusses the archaeological context of Tollund Man, examining the manner in which he was executed, his clothing, and the contents of his last meal. The second chapter, entitled \"The Grauballe Man\", deals with the eponymous bog body found in 1952 at Nebelgård Fen, located east of Tolland. Like with the previous chapter, Glob discusses his own personal investigation into the body, outlining its discovery and conservation, as well as the context of his death and burial.\n\nIn the third chapter, \"Bog People in Denmark\", Glob notes that there have been over 150 bog bodies found in Denmark, and proceeds to provide a number of examples including Haraldskær Woman and the Borremose bodies, in doing so highlighting the similarities that exist between them. Noting that many of these were discovered in the 19th and early 20th centuries, he explains that little can be known for most of them because methods of archaeological investigation and conservation were unavailable at the time. Chapter four, \"Bog People in Other Countries\", explores similar bog bodies which have been discovered in neighbouring Germany and the Netherlands, such as Windeby I, making reference to the cataloging project undertaken by the German archaeologist Alfred Dieck.\n\n\"How They Lived\" is the title of the fifth chapter, and explores the wider context of life in Iron Age Denmark, dealing with such issues as class divisions, houses and garments. The final chapter, \"When Death Came\", looks at the place of death in Iron Age Denmark, outlining ordinary funerary remains, which include both cremation and inhumation. Contrasting these methods of dealing with the dead to the corpses left in the bogs, he argues that the latter must represent evidence for a widespread tradition of human sacrifice devoted to a fertility goddess, citing the writings of Tacitus as evidence.\n\nThe \"Nature\" journal published a review provided by the English archaeologist Barry Cunliffe of the University of Southampton. He expresses only one disappointment with Glob's work, that there is what he sees as a lack of information on the daily life and social structure of Iron Age Denmark. He nevertheless feels compensated by the final chapter, which he describes as representing Glob \"at his best, building-up, in detective-style fashion\", a picture of ritual behavior in the Iron Age. Praising the use of photographs as \"brilliant\", he refers to the \"attractive\" translation of Bruce-Mitford, and considers the overall effect to be \"stimulating and provocative\". Summarizing \"The Bog People\", he labels it a \"splendid book, full of detail and fascination\" for both specialists and a wider readership interested in archaeology.\n\nRalph M. Rowlett of the University of Missouri wrote a review of \"The Bog People\" for the journal \"American Anthropologist\". He began his review by describing his background interest in bog bodies, and highlighting that he had married one of Glob's graduate students. He proceeds to note that there is much in the book that would be of interest to anthropologists, and he hoped that they would not be put off by its use of \"gossip and anecdote\" and its \"intensely personal and culturally ultra-Danish tone\", which he attributes to Glob's attempts to reach a wider, non-academic audience. Praising Glob's use of ethnohistory and epic literature to illuminate the Early Iron Age, he claims that \"The Bog People\" represents \"one of the best modern ethnographic descriptions of the North Germani of that era\" and that it furthermore provides evidence in support of Tacitus' claims. Rowlett goes on to praise Bruce-Mitford's translation, but believes that he has a \"slight tendency to over-translate\" with place names, and also disagrees with his decision to convert centimeters into inches. Ending his review, Rowlett notes that along with Alfred Deick's catalog of bog bodies, \"The Bog People\" represented \"a starter for a by no means exhausted field.\"\n\nIn an academic paper discussing the bog bodies which was published in 1995, C.S. Briggs criticised Glob for jumping to conclusions that were not supported by the evidence, exclaiming \"Can Glob's book today actually pass muster as responsible popular scholarship?\". In particular, they highlighted that he ascribed many bodies to the Iron Age when they had not been securely carbon dated and that he overconfidently proclaimed the Drumkeeragh Lady from Medieval Ireland to be a Danish Viking despite a lack of supporting evidence.\n\nIn his 1996 book on bog bodies, Wijnand Van der Sanden paid homage to Glob's \"The Bog Bodies\", describing it as a \"highly accessible work\" which had done more than any other to bring publicity to the bog cadavers. Exclaiming that he was filled with admiration for the work, he noted that he wished that he himself had written it 30 years before. In their 2007 edited volume on the reinvestigation of Grauballe Man, Pauline Asingh and Niels Lynnerup stated that Glob's book had represented a \"major contribution\" to the study of bog bodies which \"awoke many people's interest in prehistory\".\n\nIn her 2009 study of the cultural and artistic reception of the bog bodies, Karin Sanders noted that she had first become interested in archaeology through reading a copy of \"Mosefolket\" in her primary school's library, near to Copenhagen. Proceeding to describe the book as \"a classic\", she noted that even in the 21st century, it continued to offer the \"source book\" for artistic expressions of bog bodies. Proceeding to explore the influence of Glob's tome, she noted that many artists and writers had used it as a basis for learning more about the bog bodies, to whom their works were dedicated, and that Glob himself had successfully blended an engaging narrative with archaeological information, and that he was \"profoundly influenced by the potentiality of interaction between fact and fiction.\"\n"}

Jawaharlal Nehru during his imprisonment in 1942–46 at Ahmednagar fort in Maharashtra, India by British during the rule of East India Company. \"The Discovery of India\" is an honour paid to the rich cultural heritage of India, its history and its philosophy as seen through the eyes of a patriot fighting for the independence of his country. The book is widely considered one of the finest modern works on Indian history. book written in 1944 but published in 1946 as per ground sources\n\nThe journey in The Discovery of India begins from ancient history, leading up to the last years of the British Raj. He uses his knowledge of the Upanishads, Vedas, and textbooks on ancient history to introduce to the reader the development of India from the Indus Valley Civilization, through the changes in socio-political old scene scenario every foreign invader brought, to the present day conditions.\n\nNehru was jailed for his participation in the Quit India movement along with other Indian leaders, and he used this time to write down his thoughts and knowledge about India's history. The book is widely regarded as a classic in India since its first publication in 1946, and provides a broad view of Indian history, philosophy and culture, as viewed from the eyes of a liberal Indian fighting for the independence of his country.\n\nIn \"The Discovery of India\", Nehru argued that India was a historic nation with a right to sovereignty. This book also analyses in depth the philosophy of Indian life.\n\nNehru attributes some of the content of the book to his fellow prisoners at Ahmednagar jail. He gives special mention to four of them namely, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Govind Ballabh Pant, Narendra Deva and Asaf Ali. All his fellow prisoners (eleven of them) were political prisoners from various parts of the country, having deep knowledge about the various aspects of India which the book discusses. They also participated in proofreading Nehru's work and providing him with creative suggestions.\n\nThe book is presently published by the 'Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund' and the copyright for the book is held by his grand daughter-in-law Sonia Gandhi.\n\n\nThe book became the basis of the 53-episode Indian television series \"Bharat Ek Khoj\" (1988), directed by Shyam Benegal, first broadcast in 1988 on state-run Doordarshan channel.\n\n"}
{"id": "56878878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56878878", "title": "The Extremists (play)", "text": "The Extremists (play)\n\nThe Extremists is a 2009 play by C.J. Hopkins, published by Broadway Play Publishing. A political satire criticizing American views on extremism and foreign terrorism, it revolves around a television talk show host interviewing a counterterrorist expert on the imminent danger of the extremist threat. The play first premiered at the English Theatre Berlin, in Berlin, Germany, in February 2009, followed by a production at Seven Stages Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, in March 2009.\n\nThe play begins by welcoming audiences to \"Issues in Focus,\" a political news and talk program based out of Washington, and introduces them to the show's host, self-described Washington insider Dick Hedgerow. Dick announces the entirety of the night's program will be devoted to an in-depth discussion on the threat of extremism and welcomes his guest; Norman \"Norm\" Krieger, a co-founder of the fictitious polling and counterterrorism organization, the Center of Advanced Strategic Studies. Norm has been invited on the show to discuss his newly-published book, \"Extremism in the 21st Century\", which focuses on the mindset of extremists and their psychological motivations, as well as how they're able to spread their beliefs globally. Norm explains that he believes extremism should be considered the final threat to a democratic world (albeit there are other, manageable threats that are easy to handle), and tells Dick that while the government should be constantly fighting back against this threat, it's important to keep the public placated, and allow them to carry on with their normal lives.\n\nNorm further elaborates that as the threat of extremism is combated, the public's understanding of it will be skewed, and it will ultimately become too difficult to keep up with the narrative, and the majority of the details will be indiscernible. Dick insists that this isn't an issue, suggesting that they refrain from complete transparency with the American people, citing security concerns, and instead try and help them adjust the way they see things, which Norm claims were his motivations for writing his book. As their discussion continues, Dick inquires about a concrete definition of the word \"extremism,\" which Norm initially struggles with; he eventually decides that extremism is primarily defined by violence, or advocating for its use. When Dick asks if this definition transcends political leanings, such as conservative or liberal views, Norm proposes that these labels have lost their meaning beyond the competition aspect, but later contradicts himself when he says it is absolutely necessary for America to maintain the two-party system, as a country with no ideological opposition would be undemocratic.\n\nThe interview then shifts gears as it begins to investigate the extremists' intentions, which Norm believes is not only to incite violence but to make people think, asking complicated and dangerous questions that will only lead to insanity. Instead of engaging in the destructive act of thinking, Norm insists that the viewers need to stick to the facts provided by those in power in the government and the media and unquestionably devote their minds to the programming that \"freedom-loving people\" such as himself are trying to ensure all of society conforms to. When Dick objects to this concept, claiming it is nothing better than the brainwashing that extremists are guilty of, Norm reassures him that this is brainwashing people with the truth, while the other option is to be brainwashed with \"made-up extremist nonsense.\" As the play carries on, Dick and Norm constantly renege on their stances and their beliefs, and at its conclusion, they nearly break the fourth wall, seemingly aware that they are actors in an elaborate performance and are no less extremists than the terrorists they have warned the audience of.\n\n\"The Extremists\" was first produced at the English Theatre Berlin, in February 2009, directed by Walter D. Asmus. It was followed by a production at Seven Stages Theatre, who co-produced the original showing, in Atlanta, Georgia, in March of the same year.\n\nIn 2010, a staged reading of the play was performed at the Schauspielhaus Bochum in Bochum, Germany, as well as the Acker Stadt Palast performing arts center in Berlin, 2012. A German translation of the play translated by Jasna Miletic was used for both productions.\n\nClancy Productions & Assembly produced the play at the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Edinburgh, Scotland, with David Calvitto in the role of Norman Krieger, and Carol Scudder playing Jane Woolwraith, a female counterpart to the script's Dick Hedgerow.\n\nA 2018 production was performed at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, directed by Raymond Munro, with Jake Rosenthal as Norman Krieger, and Brett Iarrobino as Dick Hedgerow.\n\nCritics have praised the play for its complex and intricate text; a review of the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe production describes Hopkins' script as a \"fiendishly complex rollercoaster.\" Critics found the performances of Calvitto and Scudder dazzling, citing an incredible pace, and noting that audiences would leave the show questioning their understanding of western democracy.\n\nKolja Reichert of the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel called the performance at the English Theatre Berlin \"heady theater in the truest sense,\" and focused on the question of reality: \"Hopkins builds a construct of ideas out of rhetoric until everything revolves around one thing - what is the truth for the good guys and what is it for the bad guys?\" A review of the production in Die Tageszeitung claimed the play was an excellent example of the advantages theater holds over film, in that it lays bare the mechanisms of the media.\n"}

Working for the perfect script in the home of the Swiss actress, Melanie Winiger, she and her school friend, Max Loong, also a Swiss actor, and two friends watch a hit and run from their house, and it is none other than Johnny Depp, obviously dead. What to do with such a well known body ... as to take to their change! Unintentionally taken hashish, sex, at least in their minds, philosophy, overboarding phantasies and talks, a mix of love and little violence and the everyday life behind the scenes of the glittering metropolis, Los Angeles: four immigrants and their friends demonstrate the craziness of the movie business, but also the loving and bizarre people of LA. The actors are narcissistic, the director phlegmatic and the crew on the brink of a nervous breakdown. Shooting days will be full of mishaps and in the end the corpse is given a second chance at life, almost.\n\nRest of cast listed alphabetically: \n\nIn the first scene of the film, Melanie is at six in the morning brewing \"Espresso\" in her kitchen; a scene that will be repeated several times. Her alleged boyfriend tries quietly to come in the house, there is a dispute because of his infidelity, and Melanie is stabbed by \"Carlos\" in the kitchen.\n\n\"Melanie\" (Melanie Winiger) lives in Los Angeles and tried with her childhood friend \"Alex\" (Max Loong) who also grew up in Zürich in Switzerland, to write the screenplay for a movie in her living room. Both Swiss live in Los Angeles, as actress and actors unknown in their new home, but full of dreams and ambitions in the movie business. They seem to agree only about the planned movie's opening scene in the kitchen, and the male actor \"Carlos\"; but not about the further story, whether there should be a comedy, tragedy, a horror movie or thriller. Throughout the day, they muse about the script, fooling around, interrupted by two of their neighbours, \"Jambo\" (Ernest Allan Hausmann) and his girlfriend \"Gudrun\" (Jordan Carver), which like to enjoy themselves in Melanie's pool in the garden. Alex is watching fascinated the hustle and bustle of the two, in particular of Gudrun in the pool during a work break, developing the screenplay in thoughts, as Melanie in the living room, where she thinks about it, the protagonists of the film to make their quirky friends in Los Angeles, also originating in Switzerland. Both unaware that the brownies from Jambo not for the hosts were intended, as they included hashish and tremendously stimulate, the shown fantasies of Alex and Melanie in the movie, which had consumed wine before ...\n\nIn a later scene, the quartet discovers from the balcony a man lying at the bottom of the street, and seems to the victim of a car accident. Jambo wants to help, Melanie denies to avoid problems with the police, as they are foreigners in the United States; Gudrun and Jambo come from Germany, Jambo is illegal in the United States, and three of them are also colored people, as Melanie sets them apart after Jambo brought the supposedly dead in Melanie's apartment. Now in panic, they think about how 'to rid of the dead'. Before they can implement that idea, they notice that the dead man is undoubtedly Johnny Depp ...\n\nThe quartet misuse the 'godsend' amateurish, to integrate the supposed star in snippets of their film: love scenes with Gudrun and Melanie, a scene inspired with Melanie in a car inspired by \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" etc. They are interrupted by a self-claimed policeman who inquires on the doorstep to witness a probable hit-and-run and the remains of the victim, Alex' hash dealer, and \"Hasso\" and friend which each unannounced bursts in the apartment. Melanie would like to the dead 'get rid of' and Alex knows a \"cleaner\", which takes the supposed corpse out of the house. In a very short scene, the plastic bag used for that suppose moves, and the non-visible cleaner (but being the police officer) \"You had to be dead\" says and hits with a stick on his victim.\n\nThree months later the first scene of the film is taken finally: Alex (Director), Jambo (sound), Yangzom Brauen and two other friends for camera, script and mask, and Melanie (writer, cover). Gudrun acts as the lead actress and Carlos Leal as \"Marcel\" in the male lead role. Because Carlos is concerned about his motivation and especially the unpleasant role as villain, as he claims, the production is delayed more and more, and growing disputes between him as 'professional' and Gudrun as 'amateur', so he shouts, thus the eighth take ends in a disaster – Alex is excited about the setting, but now the movie team now notices that Gudrun actually is stabbed by Marcel in effect.\n\nIn the final scene of the film, the fictional Swiss television channel CH1 reports in its newscast, that Carlos Leal, actor and former member of \"Sens Unik\", has been arrested in Los Angeles for manslaughter, as well as Melanie Winiger and Alex Loong are suspected to be enrolled in a pre-trial detention. A possible link is mentioned with a look-alike of Johnny Depp, found death three months ago.\n\nAlthough the film flopped in the German-language cinemas, he received mostly positive reviews, and was aired on five US film festivals:\n\nProduced and collaborated on the comedy have Swiss people living in the United States. The independent film was shot during eight days at the home of Yangzom Brauen. A part of the film's budget was collected using crowdfunding. Who Killed Johnny is an independent feature film, shot with an international crew and cast in the house of Yangzom Brauen in the Hollywood hills. Funding was provided by the personal support of the crew and cast, private investors and \"Kickstarter\" as fundraising platform. The entire crew has helped even when hanging up movie posters and waived fees.\n\nThe Swiss actor and writer Yanghom Brauen debouted as director. The script for the screwball comedy was written with the co-writer and actor Gerild Wunsterl. The intended to give an inside view on strugglich artists and writers, their instincts to survive in the movie business and their ambitions to make a 'hit' in Hollywood despite all odds. While casting, Yangzom Brauen and Shari Yantra Marcacci (producer) found an 'eye catcher' being Jordan Carver making her screen debut with Swiss award winning actress Melanie Winiger, Max Loong and Carlos Leal. The premiere in Zürich was a factored flop: \"Swiss movies have it just hard when the home crowd\", and the simultaneously held \"Zürifäscht\" and the high-summer weather, tolf zhr film distributor Jonas Frei of the Swiss distributor Moviebiz to the media. The director Yangzom Brauen did \"otherwise expect the flop\". \"I am proud that we were in the cinemas ... a sequel is already planned ... only dependent on the funding\".»\n\nThe Swiss comedy celebrated their premiere on 13 February 2013 in Los Angeles, where the audience responded very positively; and on 4 July 2013 in the Swiss cinemas: just 600 spectators, of which 300 were premiere guests, visited the cinema release in Zurich. Broadcast on television was carried out for the first time on 5 and 9 December 2013 on the Swiss private channel S1.\n\nIn 2013 \"Who Killed Jonny\" was aired and awarded at international six film festivals, among them the Chicago Comedy Festival, Colortape International Film Festival, Costa Rica International Film Festival, FF2 International Film Festival, Hoboken International Film Festival and the Trinidad International Film Festival, where it get very positive response.\n\n\nThe film was released on DVD in German (FSK 12) and English language.\n\n\n"}

Ferris\n\nWilliam Reynolds Ferris (born February 5, 1942) is an American author and scholar and former chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. With Judy Peiser he co-founded the Center for Southern Folklore in Memphis, Tennessee; he was the founding director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi, and is co-editor of \"The Encyclopedia of Southern Culture\".\n\nWilliam R. Ferris was born 5 February 1942 in Vicksburg, Mississippi. He attended public school in Vicksburg until high school, when he was accepted to Brooks School in North Andover, Mass. Ferris got his B.A. in English Literature at Davidson College in 1964, and an M.A. in English Literature from Northwestern University in 1965. He attended Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, for one year from 1965 to 1966, and returned to the U.S. to continue his graduate studies. In 1967, he received a Master's and, in 1969, a Ph.D. in folklore from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nFerris's scholarship has focused on southern African American folklore and culture, through a variety of media: print, sound, film, and photography. From 1970 to 1972, he was an assistant professor in the Department of English at Jackson State University in Mississippi. From 1972 to 1979, he was an associate professor in the American and Afro-American Studies Programs at Yale University. During his tenure at Yale, Ferris co-founded the Center for Southern Folklore in Mississippi, and was its director from 1972 to 1984. Ferris returned to the South, and, from 1979 to 1997, he was the founding director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture and a professor of anthropology at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. While there, he established several annual conferences, including the Faulkner and Yoknapatawpha Conference.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton nominated Ferris to be the seventh Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in 1997, a post Ferris held through 2001. Ferris was the subject of some controversy in 2000 when the National Council on the Humanities, the NEH's advisory board, selected President Clinton for the Jefferson Lecture, which the NEH describes as \"the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities.\" The Jefferson Lecture honor had never been given to an elected official before; Ferris said that his intent was to establish a new tradition for every President to deliver a Jefferson Lecture during his or her presidency, and that this was consistent with the NEH's broader efforts under his leadership to increase public awareness of the humanities. However, some scholars and political opponents objected that the choice of Clinton represented an inappropriate and unprecedented politicization of the NEH. William J. Bennett, a conservative Republican and former chairman of the NEH under President Reagan, charged that the proposal was an example of how Clinton had \"corrupted all of those around him.\" In the wake of the controversy, President Clinton declined the honor; a White House spokesperson said the President \"didn't want the work of the National Endowment for the Humanities to be called into question.\" Despite this controversy, and even after the 2000 presidential election replaced Clinton with Republican George W. Bush, Ferris retained the strong support of Mississippi's two Republican senators, Trent Lott and Thad Cochran. They stressed Ferris's efforts during his tenure at NEH to reduce the ideological battles that had troubled the NEH under prior administrations, as well as his popularity among the state humanities leaders, and they publicly asked President Bush to retain Ferris. However, Bush ultimately decided to replace Ferris with his own appointee, Bruce Cole.\n\nIn 2002, Ferris was a Visiting Public Policy Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and joined the faculty at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as the Senior Associate Director of the Center for the Study of the American South, professor of history, and adjunct professor in the Curriculum in Folklore. He currently teaches two seminars-- \"Southern Music\" and \"Southern Literature and the Oral Tradition\"—per year.\n\nFerris is an author of ten books, including \"You Live and Learn. Then You Die and Forget It All: Ray Lum's Tales of Horses, Mules and Men,\" and co-editor of the \"Encyclopedia of Southern Culture\". His most recent book, \"The South in Color: A Visual Journal\", was published in September, 2016, by UNC Press. He has written fiction, poetry, and numerous articles on folklore and literature, as well as book, record, and film reviews. Ferris has recorded blues albums, produced 15 documentary films on southern folklore, and, for ten years, hosted the weekly Mississippi Public Radio blues show, Highway 61. Ferris's photography, documenting aspects of African American southern folklore, has been featured nationally, including in an exhibit by the Smithsonian Museum and an article by the New York Times.\n\nFerris has traveled and lectured extensively throughout Europe and the U.S. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Charles Frankel Prize in the Humanities, bestowed by President Clinton, and France's Chevalier and Officer in the Order of Arts and Letters. He has been honored by the Blues Hall of Fame, which recognized his book \"Blues from the Delta\" as one of the \"Classics of Blues Literature.\"\n\nFerris has four siblings. His brother, Grey, was a senator in the Mississippi State Legislature from 1992 to 2001, prior to his death from cancer in June 2008. Ferris is married to Marcie Cohen Ferris and has a daughter named Virginia.\n\nThe William R. Ferris Collection is located in the Southern Folklife Collection of the Wilson Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n"}
