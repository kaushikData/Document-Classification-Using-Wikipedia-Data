During and after World War II she engaged in humanitarian work, including in Crete where she nursed at the front and filmed the conflict. She then used her filming as publicity to seek assistance for those disabled as a result of the conflict.\n\nAmice Mary Calverley was born in London on 9 April 1896. Her family first moved to South Africa, then on to Canada. She studied music and earned some money from her needlework, before going to New York where she worked as a mannequin and dress-designer at Wanamaker's Store. After gaining a scholarship in 1922 to study at the Royal College of Music she returned to England.\n\nIn 1926 she started to teach herself drawing for archaeology, during which process she upset a bottle of ink over an 'immemorial sherd' at the British Museum, and became involved with the Egyptian Exploration Society in 1927.\n\nIn 1928, Amice Calverley was engaged by the Society to work as part of a project to record the decoration in the temple of King Sethos I at Abydos.\n\nAlthough the project was initially conceived as a \"purely photographic publication\", the quality of Calverley's draughtsmanship was instrumental in allowing a more ambitious publication to be realised. This was because the high standards Calverley attained in portraying the sculptures in the temple meant that it would look incongruous to simply put her drawings with schematic representations of the hieroglyphic inscriptions, and the project evolved into a more ambitious scheme - which would also require more time.\n\nDuring the winter of 1928-9, Calverley was working singlehandedly to draw and photograph the reliefs when John D. Rockefeller Jr. visited. He was so impressed by her work and by the temple reliefs that he co-sponsored the project with the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.\n\nThe resulting work was published in four volumes:\n\n\nThe photographic archive produced by Calverley became an irreplaceable resource for studying the temple, and was used by the Egypt Exploration Society in its further work on the temple in 1979-1983.\n\nAfter working in Abydos, she went to Austria in 1933, where she wrote a string quartet in F Minor.\n\nWhen World War II started, she became a driver for the Invalid Children's Aid Association during the evacuation scheme in the UK, before returning to Canada due to family illness. Coming back to England in 1941, she was sent briefly to Cairo by the Ministry of Information to be attached to the propaganda unit of the British Embassy. She returned to the UK and joined the Air Force and in 1944 became Civilian Relief worker, Mediterranean, with U.N.R.R.A.\n\nIn 1947 she returned to Abydos, where there was an outbreak of cholera, and obtained vaccines from Chicago to inoculate local villagers and British and US personnel in Upper Egypt. She then went on to Crete in 1949 where she filmed the conflict, including visiting Epirus with the Commando Brigade of Colonel Papageorgopoulos and filming the battle of Grammos. She also nursed soldiers at the front.\n\nShe later contacted many of the men she had nursed and, shocked by the lack of after-care, worked out a scheme for training the disabled. In 1950 her film of the conflict was shown at the Central Office of Information, although the funds for the wounded that she hoped it would raise never materialized.\n\nCaverley returned to Canada and continued to work on volumes V and VI of the Abydos material before her death on 10 April 1959.\n"}

Anthro was created by cartoonist Howard Post; he first appeared in \"Showcase\" #74, (Mar 1968).\n\nAfter a single \"Showcase\" appearance, Anthro was given his own title, which lasted for 6 issues (1968–69). All six issues were written and drawn by Post, with Wallace Wood providing inking for the final issue.\n\nSince the cancellation of his title, he has made minor appearances, most notably in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #2. Subsequently, Anthro appeared in the 2006 revival of \"Tales of the Unexpected\" and the 2008 miniseries \"Final Crisis\" by Grant Morrison and J. G. Jones. Anthro also starred in the first story in \"DC Universe Holiday Special 2010\".\n\nAnthro is the first Cro-Magnon boy born in the Stone Age. His father, Neanderthal caveman Ne-Ahn is the chief of his tribe, his mother a captive member of another tribe. Winning two competing cavegirls as his wives, Cro-Magnon women Embra and Nima, Anthro begins the human race, as Embra lives to bear his first child.\n\n\"Justice League Europe Annual\" #2 features a version of Anthro. In an alternate time-line, an older Silver Sorceress, lost in time, is rescued from a large creature by Anthro. He exhibits great eagerness, smashing the beast long after it is subdued. A bored cavegirl, seemingly either Embra or Nima, joins the Sorceress in watching Anthro's 'battle'.\n\nAnthro is featured in the graphic novel \"Doctor Thirteen: Architecture & Mortality\". Speaking only French, he is soon melted out of a chunk of ice into what seems to be the modern day. He assists the Doctor, Infectious Lass, Genius Jones, Captain Fear and other somewhat heroic characters in a mission to keep their existence relevant. The story ends with his status seemingly threatened by the reader of the novel itself.\n\nIssue one of \"Final Crisis\" features an extended introduction involving Anthro, where the New God Metron appears before the boy and gives him the knowledge and skill to make fire. This starts a sequence in which Anthro is able to fight off a group of savage raiders (led by Vandal Savage.) with a burning stick. In the closing pages, Anthro seems to have a vision of Kamandi. In this depiction, Anthro is much more caveman like in his attire, wearing only a loincloth and a satchel, and carrying stone and wood weapons, while his body looks more like a modern teenager rather than having a Cro-Magnon appearance. In this issue, he only expresses himself with ! and ? signs, as he is apparently unable to speak, as are the rest of the cavemen characters in the book.\n\nIn the final issue of \"Final Crisis\", Anthro appears as an old man, drawing the symbols he saw on Metron's body onto a cave wall. As he finishes drawing he dies peacefully, watched over by Bruce Wayne, who is lost in time. The after-effects of Anthro's death on his friends and family is explored in the limited series \"\".\n\nAnthro had a supporting role in the \"Booster Gold\" series, starting with issue eight. In this story, as in \"Tales of the Unexpected\", Anthro wears a leather jacket that resembles Mr. Terrific's, but has Anthro's name on the sleeves instead of \"Fair Play.\" This is an alternate time-line Anthro, who is part of a resistance group against the murderous Maxwell Lord. Fellow members include Green Arrow, Hawkman, Wild Dog and Pantha. During the flight to Lord's headquarters, Anthro is taken out by a mind-controlled Superman.\n\nIn \"Final Crisis: Superman Beyond\" #1, Superman moves briefly through Earth-20, where alternate versions of a number of DC Comics older heroes exist as 'The Society of Super-Heroes', a group of 'pulp'-style mystery men led by Doc Fate and including Immortal Man. Writer Grant Morrison described it as a \" '1940s retro thing'. \" In \"The Multiversity - The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors from the Counter-World\" #1 (2014), it is revealed that Immortal Man of Earth-20 is Anthro, who was exposed to the same meteorite that bestowed Vandal Savage's powers on him. He and Doc Fate's Society of Super-Heroes are Earth-20's last defence from an invasion by their paired evil world, Earth-40, where the militia is led by Vandal Savage and Lady Shiva.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "842741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=842741", "title": "Antillia", "text": "Antillia\n\nAntillia (or Antilia) is a phantom island that was reputed, during the 15th-century age of exploration, to lie in the Atlantic Ocean, far to the west of Portugal and Spain. The island also went by the name of Isle of Seven Cities (\"Ilha das Sete Cidades\" in Portuguese, \"Isla de las Siete Ciudades\" in Spanish).\n\nIt originates from an old Iberian legend, set during the Muslim conquest of Hispania c. 714. Seeking to flee from the Muslim conquerors, seven Christian Visigothic bishops embarked with their flocks on ships and set sail westwards into the Atlantic Ocean, eventually landing on an island (\"Antilha\") where they founded seven settlements.\n\nThe island makes its first explicit appearance as a large rectangular island in the 1424 portolan chart of Zuane Pizzigano. Thereafter, it routinely appeared in most nautical charts of the 15th century. After 1492, when the north Atlantic Ocean began to be routinely sailed, and became more accurately mapped, depictions of Antillia gradually disappeared. It nonetheless lent its name to the Spanish Antilles.\n\nThe routine appearance of such a large \"Antillia\" in 15th-century nautical charts has led to speculation that it might represent the American landmass, and has fueled many theories of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact.\n\nStories of islands in the Atlantic Ocean, legendary and otherwise, have been reported since classical antiquity. Utopian tales of the Fortunate Islands (or Isles of the Blest) were sung by poets like Homer and Horace. Plato articulated the dystopian legend of Atlantis. Ancient writers like Plutarch, Strabo, and, more explicitly, Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy, testified to the existence of the Canary Islands. The names of some real islands re-emerged as distinct mythical islands with associated legends, e.g. \"capraria\" (the island of goats) and \"canaria\" (the island of dogs) are often found on maps separately from the Canary Islands (e.g. Pizzigani brothers, 1367).\n\nThe Middle Ages saw the emergence of Christian versions of these tales. Notable among these are the Irish \"immrama\", such as the immram of Uí Corra, or the sea voyages of the 6th-century Irish missionaries Saint Brendan and Saint Malo. These are the source for several legendary Atlantic islands such as Saint Brendan's Island and the Island of Ima. The sagas of Norse seafarers to Greenland and Vinland, notably the Grœnlendinga saga and the saga of Erik the Red, have also been influential. Norse encounters with North American indigenous peoples seem to have filtered into Irish \"immrama\".\n\nThe peoples of the Iberian peninsula, who were closest to the real Atlantic islands of the Canaries, Madeira and Azores, and whose seafarers and fishermen may have seen and even visited them, articulated their own tales. Medieval Andalusian Arabs related stories of Atlantic island encounters in the legend (told by al-Masudi) of the 9th-century navigator Khashkhash of Cordoba and the 12th-century story (told by al-Idrisi) of the eight \"Maghurin\" (Wanderers) of Lisbon.\n\nGiven the tendency of the legends of different seafarers – Greek, Norse, Irish, Arab and Iberian – to cross-fertilize and influence each other, the exact source of some legendary Atlantic islands – such as the mythical islands of Brasil and the Isle of Mam – are impossible to disentangle.\n\nIt is from Christian Iberia that the legend of \"Antillia\" emerged. According to the legend, in c. 714, during the Muslim conquest of Hispania, seven Christian bishops of Visigothic Hispania, led by the Bishop of Porto, embarked with their parishioners on ships and set sail westward into the Atlantic Ocean to escape the Arab conquerors. They stumbled upon an island and decided to settle there, burning their ships to permanently sever their link to their now Muslim-dominated former homeland. The bishops erected seven settlements (the \"Seven Cities\") on the island. In one reading (from Grazioso Benincasa), the seven cities are named Aira, Antuab, Ansalli, Ansesseli, Ansodi, Ansolli and Con.\n\nThe legend, in this form, is told in various places. The principal source is an inscription on Martin Behaim's 1492 Nuremberg globe which reads (in English translation):\n\nThe legend is also found inscribed in the 1507/08 map of Johannes Ruysch, which reads (in English):\nRuysch's inscription is reproduced almost verbatim in the \"Libro\" of Spanish historian Pedro de Medina (1548). Medina gives the island's dimensions as 87 leagues in length and 28 in width, with \"many good ports and rivers\", and says it is situated on the latitude of the Straits of Gibraltar, that sailors have seen it from a distance, but disappears when they approach it.\n\nThe adjustment to the 714 date and the burning of the ships is due to Ferdinand Columbus (1539), who also reports an alleged encounter with the islanders by a Portuguese ship in the time of Henry the Navigator (c. 1430s–1440s). António Galvão (1563) reports that a 1447 Portuguese ship stumbled on the island, and met its (Portuguese-speaking) inhabitants, who reported they had fled there in the \"time of Roderic\" and asked whether the Moors still dominated Hispania. More elaborate versions of this story have been told in more modern times.\n\nYet another variant of the tale is told in Manuel de Faria e Sousa (1628), of Sacaru, a Visigothic governor of Mérida. Besieged by the Muslim armies and finding his situation hopeless, Sacaru negotiated capitulation, and proceeded, with all who wished to follow him, to embark on a fleet for exile in the Canary islands. Faria e Sousa notes they may not have reached their destination, but may have ended up instead on an Atlantic Ocean island \"populated by Portuguese, that has seven cities ... which some imagine to be that one which can be seen from Madeira, but when they wish to reach it, disappears\".\n\nThe island is mentioned in a royal letter of King Afonso V of Portugal (dated 10 November 1475), where he grants the knight Fernão Teles \"the Seven Cities and any other populated islands\" he might find in the western Atlantic Ocean. It is mentioned again in a royal letter (dated 24 July 1486), issued by King John II of Portugal at the request of Fernão Dulmo authorizing him to search for and \"discover the island of Seven Cities\".\n\nAlready by the 1490s, there are rumors that silver can be found in the island's sands. In the 16th century, the legend gave rise to the independent Spanish legends of the Seven Cities of Gold, reputed by mercenary conquistadors to be fabulously wealthy and located somewhere on the mainland of America.\n\nThe term \"Antillia\" is probably derived from the Portuguese \"Ante-Ilha\" (\"Fore-Island\", \"Island of the Other\", or \"Opposite Island\"). It may be a reference to the belief that the island lay directly \"opposite\" from mainland Portugal (as it is usually charted), consistent with the Seven Cities story. Its size and rectangular shape is a near-mirror image of the Kingdom of Portugal itself. Some suggest the \"ante-ilha\" etymology might be older, possibly related in meaning to the \"Aprositus\" (\"the Inaccessible\"), the name reported by Ptolemy for one of the Fortunate Isles.\n\nOthers regard the \"ante-ilha\" etymology as unsatisfactory, on the basis that \"ante\", in geographical usage, suggests it sits opposite another island, not a continent. As a result, alternative etymological theories of \"Antillia\" abound. One theory was that \"Antillia\" is merely a poorly-transcribed reference to Plato's \"Atlantis\". Another is that it is a corruption of \"Getulia\", an ancient Roman name for a geographical location in northwestern Africa. Another theory, famously forwarded by Alexander von Humboldt is that it comes from the Arabic \"al-Tin\" or \"al-Tennyn\", for \"dragon\", a reference to the old Arab legends about sea dragons on the edge of the ocean (frequently depicted in Arab maritime charts), and that the island may have been known as \"Jezirat al Tennyn\", or \"Dragon's Isle\", in Andalusian Arab legend.\n\nOne more recent hypothesis (although not finding wide acceptance), is that \"Antillia\" may mean \"in front of Thule\". Sometimes written \"Tile\", Thule was a semi-mythical reference to Iceland, already spoken of in classical sources. If so, then \"ante Tile\", the \"island before Thule\", might very well be Ireland, which might have had seven \"cities\" at the time. This theory, however, seems highly speculative. Ireland (\"Hibernia\") was well-known and appears distinctly on all 15th-century maps.\n\nIn a fresh work on the subject, the author Demetrio Charalambous notes that in medieval maps, the name of the island is written Antylia, which is inconsistent with the interpretation commonly accepted that the name means \"ante-ilha\" in Portuguese. No medieval map records the name \"Antilha\", by which the author dismisses the name as being Portuguese. Instead, he noted that the first cartographers to mention the island (although they did not represent it) were Francesco and Domenico Pizigano in 1367, who called it Antullia. From this follows that the name means \"Anti-Tullia\", i.e. Anti-Thule, later transformed into Antyllia, and finally Antillia. According to his interpretation, the name denotes the island opposite to Tyle, but this does not mean it is before Iceland, but beyond it, as represented in the maps. The name means the island opposite to Tyle by sailing southwest, and therefore refers to America.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Canary Islands by Europeans in the 14th century revived an interest in Atlantic island myths. With the existence of lands out in the Atlantic Ocean confirmed, 14th-century European geographers began plumbing the old legends and plotting and naming many of these mythical islands on their nautical charts, alongside the new discoveries. Mythical Atlantic islands litter the early 14th-century portolan charts of Pietro Vesconte and Angelino Dulcert.\n\nSome historians believe the legend of \"Antillia\" was first insinuated cartographically in the 1367 portolan of the Venetian brothers Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano. This was insinuated by an inscription (albeit with no island) on the western edge of the map, which was read by some 19th-century historians as referring to \"statues on the shores of \"Atullia\"\" (\"ante ripas Atulliae\") beyond which sailors should not pass. However, later readings have suggested it should be read as the statues of \"Arcules\" (Hercules), and that the inscription's reference is probably to the Pillars of Hercules, the \"non plus ultra\" (outer limits) of ancient navigation, and not Antillia.\nAntillia makes its first unambiguous appearance in the 1424 portolan chart of Venetian cartographer Zuane Pizzigano, as part of a group of four islands, lying far in the Atlantic Ocean some 250 leagues west of Portugal, and 200 leagues west of the Azores archipelago (which also usually depicted in contemporary charts). Pizzigano drew Antillia as a large, red, rectangular island, indented with bays and dotted with seven settlements, with the inscription \"ista ixola dixemo antilia\" (\"this island is called antillia\"). Some sixty leagues north of it is the comparable large blue Satanazes island (\"ista ixolla dixemo satanazes\", called Satanagio/Satanaxio/Salvagio in later maps), capped by a small umbrella-shaped \"Saya\" (called 'Tanmar' or 'Danmar' in later maps). Some twenty leagues west of Antilia is the small blue companion island of \"Ymana\" (the 'Royllo' of later maps). These four islands will be collectively drawn together in many later 15th-century maps, with the same relative size, position and shape Pizzigano gave them in 1424. They are commonly referred to collectively as the \"Antillia group\" or (to use Beccario's label) the \"insulae de novo rep(er)te\" (\"islands newly reported\").\n\nCartographic appearances of Antillia (in chronological order):\n\n\nAs is evident, on some maps (e.g. Pareto, Soligo, Behaim), Antillia appears without Satanazes.\n\nSignificantly, although included in his map of 1436, the Antillia group is omitted in the later Andrea Bianco map of 1448, although some authors believe that two rectangular islands depicted by Bianco much further south (in the environs of Cape Verde), and labelled merely \"dos ermanos\" (\"two brothers\") may be a reference to Antilia and Satanazes.\n\nThe controversial (possibly fake) Vinland map, dated by its supporters around 1440, shows the outlines of Antillia and Satanazes islands (but not the two smaller ones) under the general label \"Magnae insulae Beati Brandani\" (great islands of St Brendan).\n\nAntillia (and all its companions) are conspicuously omitted in the map of Gabriel de Vallseca (1439), the Genoese map (1457), the Fra Mauro map (1459) and the maps of Henricus Martellus Germanus (1484, 1489) and Pedro Reinel (c. 1485). With a few exceptions (e.g. Ruysch), Antillia disappears from almost all known maps composed after Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas in the 1490s (e.g. it is absent on the 1500 map of Juan de la Cosa, the Cantino planisphere of 1502, etc.)\n\nIt appears in virtually all of the known surviving Portolan charts of the Atlantic – notably those of the Genoese B. Beccario or Beccaria (1435), the Venetian Andrea Bianco (1436), and Grazioso Benincasa (1476 and 1482). It is usually accompanied by the smaller and equally legendary islands of Royllo, St Atanagio, and Tanmar, the whole group often classified as \"insulae de novo repertae\", newly discovered islands.\n\nOn these maps, Antillia was typically depicted on a similar scale to that of Portugal, lying around 200 miles west of the Azores. It was drawn as an almost perfect rectangle, its long axis running north-south, but with seven trefoil bays shared between the east and west coasts. Each city lay on a bay. The form of the island occasionally becomes more figurative than the semi-abstract representations of Bartolomeo de Pareto, Benincasa and others: Bianco, for instance, shifts its orientation to northwest-southeast, transmutes generic bays into river mouths (including a large one on the northeastern coast), and elongates a southern tail into a cape with a small cluster of islets offshore.\nAround the time of Spain's discovery of South America, Antillia dwindles substantially in size on Behaim's globe and later charts. Contrary to the earlier descriptions of the two island groups as distinct entities, a 16th-century notion relegates Antillia to the island of São Miguel, the largest of the Azores, where a national park centering on two lakes still bears the name Sete Cidades.\n\nA Portuguese legend tells how the island was settled in the early 8th century in the face of the Moorish conquest of Iberia by the Archbishop of Porto, six other bishops and their parishioners to avoid the ensuing Moorish invasion. Each congregation founded a city, namely, Aira, Anhuib, Ansalli, Ansesseli, Ansodi, Ansolli and Con, and once established, burnt their caravel ships as a symbol of their autonomy. The reporting of this settlement comes courtesy of a young couple who eloped back to Europe on a rare trading ship and reported the seven cities as a model of agricultural, economic and cultural harmony. Centuries later, the island became known as a proto-utopian commonwealth, free from the disorders of less favoured states.\n\nSince these events predated the Kingdom of Portugal and the clergy's heritage marked a claim to significant strategical gains, Spain counterclaimed that the expedition was, in fact, theirs. One of the chief early descriptions of the heritage of Antillia is inscribed on the globe which the geographer Martin Behaim made at Nuremberg in 1492. Behaim relates the Catholic escape from the barbarians, though his date of 734 is probably a mistake for 714. The inscription adds that a Spanish vessel sighted the island in 1414, while a Portuguese crew claimed to have landed on Antillia in the 1430s.\n\nIn a later version of the legend, the bishops fled from Mérida, Spain, when Moors attacked it around the year 1150.\n\nWith this legend underpinning the growing reports of a bountiful civilisation midway between Europe and Cipangu, or Japan, the quest to discover the Seven Cities attracted significant attention. However, by the last decade of the 15th century, the Portuguese state's official sponsorship of such exploratory voyages had ended, and in 1492, under the Spanish flag of Ferdinand and Isabella, Christopher Columbus set out on his historic journey to Asia, citing the island as the perfect halfway house by the authority of Paul Toscanelli. Columbus had supposedly gained charts and descriptions from a Spanish navigator, who had \"sojourned ... and died also\" at Columbus's home in Madeira, after having made landfall on Antillia.\n\nOthers following d'Anghiera suggested contenders in the West Indies for Antillia's heritage (most often either Puerto Rico or Trinidad), and as a result the Caribbean islands became known as the Antilles. As European explorations continued in the Americas, maps reduced the scale of the island Antillia, tending to place it mid-Atlantic, whereas the Seven Cities of Gold were attributed to mainland Central or North America, as the various European powers vied for territory in the New World.\n\n\n"}

The text concludes with 'an epilogue describing the tragic end of the Arab commander Muḥammad b. al-Ḳāsim and of the two daughters of Dāhir, the defeated king of Sind'.\n\nAs one of the only written sources about the Arab conquest of Sindh, and therefore the origins of Islam in India, the \"Chach Nama\" is a key historical text that has been co-opted by different interest groups for several centuries, and it has significant implications for modern imaginings about the place of Islam in South Asia. Accordingly, its implications are much disputed.\n\nAccording to Manan Ahmed Asif, the \"Chach Nama\" has been historically significant. It was a source of colonial understanding of the origins of Islam in the Indian subcontinent through the Sindh region. The text has been one of the sources of historiography and religious antagonism during the South Asian people's struggles to gain independence from the colonial British Empire. The text, states Asif, has been a source of a colonial construction of a long history of religious antagonism between Hindus and Muslims, and one of narratives of Muslim origins in South Asia by various twentieth-century historians and writers. It has been a part of state-sanctioned history textbooks of Pakistan. The story of the seventeen-year-old Muhammad bin Qasim's attack on \"Pak-o-Hind\" was mentioned by the Pakistani professional Faisal Shahzad prior to his 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt.\n\nAs we have it today, the \"Chach Nama\" is the work of ʿAlī b. Ḥāmid b. Abī Bakr Kūfī. He was writing in Persian, but claimed to be translating a book in Arabic, which he had discovered among the possessions of the ḳāḍī of Alōr, Ismāʿīl b. ʿAlī ... b. ʿUthmān al-Thaḳafī (who was appointed the first kādī of Alōr by Muhammad Kāsim after the conquest of the Sindh.) According to Y. Friedmann,\n\na comparison between the Čač-Nāma and Arab historians such as Balādhurī [...] bears out the Arab provenance of those parts of the book that describe the battles leading to the conquest of Sind; Kūfī might well have used Madāʾinī’s \"Kitāb Thaghr al-Hind\" and \"Kitāb ʿUmmāl\" (or \"Aʿmāl\") \"al-Hind\" [...] The Čač-Nāma seems to have preserved Madāʾinī’s tradition concerning India in a much fuller fashion than classical Arab histories. On the other hand, the book also comprises a considerable amount of material which probably reflects a local Indian historical tradition. The part dealing with the rise of the Čač dynasty (14-72), the story of Darōhar, Djaysinha and Djanki (229-234), and some traditions attributed to a Brahman called Rāmsiya (179) and to “some Brahman elders” (\"baʿḍī mashāyikh-i barāhima\") (197; cf. also 206) deserve to be mentioned in this context.\n\nThe \"Chach Nama\" survived in the following key manuscripts: British Library Or. 1787; India Office, Ethé 435.\n\nAccording to Manan Ahmed Asif, \"Chach Nama\" is not a work of translation nor is a book of conquest. ʿAlī states that he wrote it to gain favor in the court of Nasiruddin Qabacha. Asif adds that Qasim's campaign in \"Chach Nama\" is a deliberate shadowing of campaigns Chach undertook in \"four corners of Sindh\". He states that the \"Chach Nama\" is centred on the historical figure of Muhammad bin Qasim found in extant Arabic manuscripts, but the 13th-century text is different, creatively extrapolating the alternative versions. For example, the version of Qasim story found in the \"Kitab Futuh al-Buldan\" of the 9th-century Al-Baladhuri and the version found in memoirs of 11th-century Al-Biruni, are much simpler, \"markedly different\" in structure, circumstances and martial campaign than that elaborated in the \"Chach Nama\". In the Baladhuri version, for example, Qasim does not enter or destroy \"budd\" (temples) or call them \"like the churches of the Christians and the Jews and the fire houses of the Magians\". Further the Baladhuri version of the Qasim story repeatedly credits the monks and priestly mediators of Hind with negotiating peace with him, while \"Chach Nama\" presents a different, martial version. The \"Chach Nama\" drew upon Baladhuri's work, and others, as a template for the political history, but created a different and imaginative version of events. According to Asif, \"there is little reason for us to consider the facticity\" of verses in the Baladhuri's version either, an account written to glorify the martial conquest of courtly Abbasid times and composed over 200 years after Qasim's death. The \"Chach Nama\" is a romantic work influenced by the 13th-century history, not a historical text of the 8th-century, states Asif.\n\nThe Táríkh Maasúmí, and the Tuhfatulkirám are two other Muslim histories of the same period and, on occasion, give differing accounts of some details. Later Muslim chronicles like those by Nizamuddin Ahmad, Nurul Hakk, Firishta, and Masum Shah draw their account of the Arab conquest from the Chach Nama.\n\nScholars such as Peter Hardy, André Wink and Yohanan Friedmann, question the historical authenticity and political theory embedded in the \"Chachnama\" because of its geographical errors, glaring inconsistencies with alternate Persian and Arabic accounts of the Qasim story, and the missing Arabic tradition in it even though the text alleges to be a Persian translation of an Arabic original.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2370329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2370329", "title": "Euthenics", "text": "Euthenics\n\nEuthenics is the study of the improvement of human functioning and well-being by improvement of living conditions. Affecting the \"improvement\" through altering external factors such as education and the controllable environment, including the prevention and removal of contagious disease and parasites, environmentalism, education regarding employment, home economics, sanitation, and housing.\n\nRose Field notes of the definition in a May 23, 1926 \"New York Times\" article, \"the simplest being efficient living\". A right to environment.\n\nThe Flynn effect has been often cited as an example of euthenics. Another example is the steady increase in body size in industrialized countries since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nEuthenics is not normally interpreted to have anything to do with changing the composition of the human gene pool by definition, although everything that affects society has some effect on who reproduces and who does not.\n\nThe term was derived in the late 19th century from the Greek verb \"eutheneo\", εὐθηνέω (\"eu\", well; the, root of τίθημι \"tithemi\", to cause).\n\nAlso from the Greek Euthenia, Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—\"Herodotus\".\n\nThe opposite of Euthenia is Penia, Πενία (\"deficiency\" or \"poverty\") the personification of poverty and need.\n\nEllen H. Swallow Richards (1842–1911; Vassar Class of '70) was one of the first writers to use the term, in \"The Cost of Shelter\" (1905), with the meaning \"the science of better living\". It is unclear if (and probably unlikely that) any of the study programs of euthenics ever completely embraced Richards' multidisciplinary concept, though several nuances remain today, especially that of interdisciplinarity.\n\nAfter Richards' death in 1911, Julia Lathrop (1858–1932; VC '80)—one of Vassar's most distinguished alumnae—continued to promote the development of an interdisciplinary program in euthenics at the college. Lathrop soon teamed with alumna Minnie Cumnock Blodgett (1862–1931; VC '84), who with her husband, John Wood Blodgett, offered financial support to create a program of euthenics at Vassar College. Curriculum planning, suggested by Vassar president Henry Noble MacCracken in 1922, began in earnest by 1923, under the direction of Professor Annie Louise Macleod (Chemistry; First woman PhD, McGill University, 1910).\n\nAccording to Vassar's chronology entry for March 17, 1924, \"the faculty recognized euthenics as a satisfactory field for sequential study (major). A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a multidisciplinary program [radical at the time] focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. Students in euthenics could take courses in horticulture, food chemistry, sociology and statistics, education, child study, economics, economic geography, physiology, hygiene, public health, psychology and domestic architecture and furniture. With the new division came the first major in child study at an American liberal arts college.\"\n\nFor example, a typical major in child study in euthenics includes introductory psychology, laboratory psychology, applied psychology, child study and social psychology in the Department of Psychology; the three courses offered in the Department of Child Study; beginning economics, programs of social reorganization and the family in Economics; and in the Department of Physiology, human physiology, child hygiene, principles of public health.\n\nThe Vassar Summer Institute of Euthenics accepted its first students in June 1926. Created to supplement the controversial euthenics major which began February 21, 1925, it was also located in the new Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics (York & Sawyer, architects; ground broke October 25, 1925). Some Vassar faculty members (perhaps emotionally upset with being displaced on campus to make way, or otherwise politically motivated) contentiously \"believed the entire concept of euthenics was vague and counter-productive to women's progress.\"\n\nHaving overcome a lukewarm reception, Vassar College officially opened its Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics in 1929. Dr. Ruth Wheeler (Physiology and Nutrition – VC '99) took over as director of euthenics studies in 1924. Wheeler remained director until Mary Shattuck Fisher Langmuir (VC '20) succeeded her in 1944, until 1951.\n\nThe college continued for the 1934–35 academic year its successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls. Intended to help students meet their college costs by working in their residences. For example, in Main, students earned $40 a year by doing relatively light work such as cleaning their rooms.\n\nIn 1951, Katharine Blodgett Hadley (VC '20) donated $400,000, through the Rubicon Foundation, to Vassar to help fund operating deficits in the current and succeeding years and to improve faculty salaries.\n\n\"Discontinued for financial reasons, the Vassar Summer Institute for Family and Community Living, founded in 1926 as the Vassar Summer Institute of Euthenics, held its last session, July 2, 1958. This was the first and last session for the institute's new director, Dr. Mervin Freedman.\"\n\nElmira College is noted as the oldest college still in existence which (as a college for women) granted degrees to women which were the equivalent of those given to men (the first to do so was the now-defunct Mary Sharp College). Elmira College became coeducational in all of its programs in 1969.\n\nA special article was written in the December 12, 1937 \"New York Times\", quoting recent graduates of Elmira College, urging for courses in colleges for men on the care of children. Reporting that \"preparation for the greatest of all professions, that of motherhood and child-training, is being given the students at Elmira College in the Nursery School which is Conducted as part of the Department of Euthenics.\"\n\nElmira College was one of the first of the liberal arts colleges to recognize the fact that women should have some special training, integrated with the so-called liberal studies, which would prepare them to carry on, with less effort and fewer mistakes, a successful family life. Courses in nutrition, household economics, clothing selection, principles of foods and meal planning, child psychology, and education in family relations are a part of the curriculum.\n\nThe Elmira College nursery school for fifteen children between the ages of two and five years was opened primarily as a laboratory for college students, but it had become so popular with parents in the community that there was always a long waiting list.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" article notes how the nursery had become one of the essential laboratories of the college, where recent mothers testified to the value of the training they received while in college. \"Today,\" one graduate said, \"when it is often necessary for young women to continue professional work outside the home after marriage, it is important that young fathers, who must share in the actual care and training of the children, should have some knowledge of correct methods.\"\n\nMany factors led to the movement never getting the funding it needed to remain relevant, including: vigorous debate about the exact meaning of euthenics, a strong antifeminism movement paralleling even stronger women's rights movements, confusion with the term eugenics, the economic impact of the Great Depression and two world wars. These factors also prevented the discipline from gaining the attention it needed to put together a lasting, vastly multidisciplinary curriculum. Therefore, it split off into separate disciplines. Child Study is one such curriculum.\n\nMartin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that \"Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists.\" Thus, the end of euthenics as originally defined by Ellen Swallow Richards ensued.\n\nAccording to Ellen Richards, in her book \"Euthenics: the science of controllable environment\" (1910):\n\nDebate over misconceptions about the movement started almost from the beginning. In his comparison \"Eugenics, Euthenics, And Eudemics\", (American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 18, No. 6, May 1913), Lester F. Ward of Brown University opens the second section regarding euthenics lamenting: \nWard later noted about the organic environment that:\nVassar historians note that \"critics faulted the new program as a weakening of science and a slide into vocationalism. The influential educator and historian of education, Abraham Flexner—one of the founders of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study—attacked the program, along with other “ad hoc” innovations like intercollegiate athletics and student governments, in Universities, American, English, German (1930).\"\n\nIn the summer of 1926, Margaret Sanger created a stir when she gave a radio address, called \"Racial Betterment\", in the first Euthenics Institute, where she praised attempts to \"close our gates to the so-called 'undesirables'\" and proposed efforts to \"discourage or cut down on the rapid multiplication of the unfit and undesirable at home\", by government-subsidized voluntary sterilization. (from \"The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger\", vol. 1 (2003), Esther Katz, ed.)\n\nEugenicist, Charles Benedict Davenport, noted in his article \"Euthenics and Eugenics,\" found reprinted in the \"Popular Science Monthly\" of January 1911, page 18, 20:\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed dated October 24, 1926, entitled \"Eugenics and euthenics\", in response to an op-ed entitled \"Bright Children Who Fail\" which appeared the previous October 15, student of child psychology, Joseph A.

Its mission is to work to help the people of Cité Soleil better their lives, largely through the model of a traditional Haitian labor cooperative called a konbit.\n\nThe movement was founded by 6 neighborhoods within Cité Soleil: La Difference (also as Twa Bebe), La Reference (also known as Bwa Nef), Ti Ayiti/Projet Lintho 1, Norway, Bo Gadrie/Soley 9, and Vodrey (in rural Cité Soleil). The initial meeting of these neighborhoods, which was the precursor to the founding of the movement, was facilitated by Future Generations, but the movement has no NGO or government body officially supporting it. The movement grew quickly in the first 6–8 months of its existence, and currently includes dozens of neighborhoods from nearly every area of Cité Soleil.\n\nKonbit Soley Leve is not an official organization, and therefore does not undertake activities like a typical organization. It is horizontal in its structure, and initiatives are decided by consensus at open weekly meetings. The movement acts as an umbrella under which groups from different neighborhoods of Cité Soleil can come together to pursue common goals. \n\nThe movement’s activities are financed by contributions of local residents of the participating neighborhoods.

One of the most visible forms of activities is the \"konbit\", in which residents of many different neighborhoods come together to help one neighborhood solve a problem, such as a flooded canal.\n\nOverall, Soley Leve is considered a philosophy as much as a movement. The philosophy is based on the principles of interdependence (neighborhoods working together), self-realization (that the community is in charge of its destiny), self-reliance (that Cité Soleil does not need to be dependent upon outsiders), and empowerment (that the residents of Cité Soleil have the potential to change their own situations). Anyone who conducts activities in accordance with those principles is considered to be a part of the Soley Leve movement, whether or not they attend the open weekly meetings.\n"}

Furthermore, it has been set up to ensure sustainable development vis-a-vis industry. This association along with was involved with the Fertile Land Protection Movement in putting forward a Citizen's Report that was filed against the Indian Supreme Court in early 2011. The association works in tandem with other associations to ensure that environmental justice issues in this area are given emphasis by the government as well as by other important entities.\n\nMIWA is based out of IMT (Industrial Model Township) Manesar. The members of MIWA ultimately want to ensure that Manesar is environmentally sustainable. Many members have either set up businesses or are associated with the region if Manesar because they live in an around the National Capital Region, New Delhi.\n\nThe origins of the afforestation drive that is currently underway in Manesar was thought of all the way back in 1999, according to this news source. In other words, the desire to start a greening drive, revolving around afforestation and the sustainable usage of water can be traced all the way back to 1999.\n\nManesar Industries Welfare Association (MIWA) fought a legal battle in the Supreme Court of India with the HSIIDC (Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructural Development Corporation) in 2011 to avoid the acquisition of farmers’ land spread over an area of 1100 acres by the Haryana government. The government was acquiring the land for the development of Manesar extension area known as Industrial Model Township (IMT) planned to spread in an area of over 6,000 acres. MIWA is a one-of-its kind industrial association as it battled for the cause of farmers whose agricultural land was acquired to be handed over to the same league of industrialists. According to this article in the Hindustan Times MIWA had supported the farmers’ movement known as Fertile Land Protection Movement in filing the written petition in the Supreme Court which gave relief to them by putting a stay order to the acquisition orders of the government. If MIWA had not decided to conserve this land, approximately 9500 acres of land would have been used for industrial purposes.\n\nAccording to The Hindustan Times, MIWA is involved with an afforestation drive in the Aravalli Hills. It is one of two organisations that have volunteered to ensure afforestation occurs in the Aravalli Hills. The organisations also have provided rainwater harvesting pits. This area of the Aravalli Hills is otherwise an extremely built-up area as it located in the Industrial Model Township (IMT), which includes the KMP highway as well as a Maruti unit.\n\nIn fact under the auspices of MIWA, a cleaning drive was implemented in two sectors of IMT Manesar, which is called Project \"Naya Savera,\" which not only ensures that the roads on these two sectors are clean but also ensures employment for people.\n\nAccording to this article in Times of India, MIWA was also involved in a mapping project. The mapping project involved carrying out a survey of fertile and usable areas in and around the villages of IMT Manesar.\n\nMIWA, has especially collaborated with the Fertile Land Protection Movement, namely when filing the Citizen's Report in early 2011. Thus in order to provide more support, these two grassroots-based organizations collaborated vis-a-vis the Citizen's Report in early 2011.\n\nThe work carried out by MIWA helps to solve an Environmental Justice issue inherent in India. This issue involves the maintenance of jobs to those who need them the most, namely farmers, who otherwise lack education to get jobs outside the farming communities. Furthermore, it is an Environmental Justice issue because local jobs in the form of farming are diminishing in the name of development. As a result, according to the Citizens Report, there is a loss of traditional way of life. Thus local communities are being left unemployed and thus indulge in vices such as alcoholism. Finally, taking away of land from local farmers and residents is resulting in their displacement, according to the Citizens Report filed in early 2011. The Citizens Report was also cited by this Times of India article.\n\nThere had to be intervention in this area of the Aravalli Hills simply because there with the advancement of deforestation due to development and the occurrence of \"concretizing,\" as was mentioned in the Citizens Report, the result is environmental degradation. Thus the goal of afforestation that is on the process of being underway is highly necessary and will be carried near the Maruti Plant located in this area of the Aravalli Hills. The afforestation drive has been partly in motion as was mentioned by this article in the Times of India.Furthermore, environmental degradation in this area takes the form of destruction of the natural water supply as was mentioned in the Citizens Report .\n\nAmina Shervani has been majorly involved with MIWA. She is a woman entrepreneur who has been helped in the drive towards afforestation and the drive towards rainwater harvesting by her husband, Milin Kapoor. The other people involved in MIWA are M.K. Bhargava, Manmohan Gaind, Vikash Gupta and Jagdish Kukreja. According to this article in the Times of India, Amina Shervani is a \"member of the association and an industrialist who is based in Manesar Sector 3.\" She was one of the key people behind the Citizen's Report that was filed in the Supreme Court in early 2011. This report was filed to emphasize the issue of environmental degradation and social degradation that faced the region of Manesar, namely near the Aravalli Hills.\n\n"}

It can be used to recognize metaphors in spoken and written language. Mainly intended for scholars, it can be helpful in empirical research. The procedure aims to determine the relationship of a particular lexical unit in the discourse and recognize its use in a particular context as possibly metaphorical. Since many words can be considered metaphorical in different contexts, MIP requires a clear distinction between words that convey metaphorical meaning and those that do not, despite the fact that language generally differs in the degrees of metaphoricity.\nA group of scholars called Pragglejaz started the Pragglejaz procedure in 2007, and elaborated on a detailed method of identifying metaphors. Note that this method does not deal with an author's possible intention to express metaphorical meanings, and does not identify metaphorical utterances and conventional linguistic metaphors. It also does not indicate ordinary procedures people use to determine metaphors or exclude other possible non-literalness.\n\n"}

{"id": "20207047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20207047", "title": "Oxhide ingot", "text": "Oxhide ingot\n\nOxhide ingots are metal slabs, usually of copper but sometimes of tin, produced and widely distributed during the Mediterranean Late Bronze Age (LBA). Their shape resembles the hide of an ox with a protruding handle in each of the ingot’s four corners. Early thought was that each ingot was equivalent to the value of one ox. However, the similarity in shape is simply a coincidence. The ingots’ producers probably designed these protrusions to make the ingots easily transportable overland on the backs of pack animals. Complete or partial oxhide ingots have been discovered in Sardinia, Crete, Peloponnese, Cyprus, Cannatello in Sicily, Boğazköy in Turkey (ancient Hattusa, the Hittite capital), Qantir in Egypt (ancient Pi-Ramesses), and Sozopol in Bulgaria. Archaeologists have recovered many oxhide ingots from two shipwrecks off the coast of Turkey (one off Uluburun and one in Cape Gelidonya).\n\nThe appearance of oxhide ingots in the archaeological record corresponds with the beginning of the bulk copper trade in the Mediterranean—approximately 1600 BC. The earliest oxhide ingots found come from Crete and date to the Late Minoan IB, approximately 1500 BC to 1450 BC. The latest oxhide ingots date to approximately 1000 BC, and were found on Sardinia. The copper trade was largely maritime: the principal sites where oxhide ingots are found are at sea, on the coast, and on islands.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the oxhide ingots served as a form of currency. Ingots found in excavations at Mycenae are now part of the exhibits of the Numismatic Museum of Athens. Cemal Pulak argues that the weights of the Uluburun ingots are similar enough to have allowed \"a rough but quick reckoning of a given quantity of raw metal prior to weighing\". But George Bass proposes, via the Gelidonya ingots, whose weights are approximately the same if somewhat lower than the Uluburun ingot weights, that the weights were not standard and thus the ingots were not a currency. Another theory is that the oxhide shape, as well as the bun shape that some ingots took, was a visual statement that the ingot at hand is part of a legitimate trade. In Sardinia, oxhide ingot fragments have been found in hoards with bun ingots and scrap metal and, in some cases, in a metallurgical workshop. Citing this evidence, Vasiliki Kassianidou argues that the oxhide ingots \"were meant to be used rather than to be kept as prestige goods\".\n\nIn 1982, a diver discovered a shipwreck off the shore of Uluburun, Turkey. The ship contained 317 copper ingots in the normal oxhide shape, 36 with only two corner protrusions, 121 shaped like buns, and five shaped like pillows. The oxhide ingots (ingots with two or four protrusions) range in weight from 20.1 to 29.5 kg after being cleaned of their corrosion. These ingots were found stacked in four rows following a herringbone pattern. The smooth sides of the ingots faced downwards, and the lowest layer rested on brushwood. There are three whole tin oxhide ingots, and there are many tin ingots cut into quarters or halves, with their corner protrusion(s) still intact. Besides metal ingots, the cargo included ivory, metal jewelry, and Mycenaean, Cypriot, and Canaanite pottery. Tree-ring dating of firewood from the ship gives an approximate date of 1300 BC. More than 160 copper oxhide ingots, 62 bun ingots, and some of the tin oxhide ingots have incised marks typically on their rough sides. Some of these marks—resembling fish, oars, and boats—relate to the sea, and they were probably incised after casting, when the ingot was received or exported.\n\nRecently Yuval Goren proposed that the ten tons of copper ingots, one ton of tin ingots, and the resin stored in the Canaanite jars aboard the ship were one complete package. The recipients of the copper, tin, and resin would have used these materials for bronze casting through the lost-wax technique.\n\nIn the early 1950s, divers found the remains of a shipwreck in Cape Gelidonya, off the coast of Turkey. The remains included a substantial amount of copper oxhide ingot material: 34 in full, five in half, 12 corners, and 75 kg of random fragments. Twenty-four full copper oxhide ingots have stamps on their centers—usually of a circle containing intersecting lines. These stamps were likely made when the metal was soft. In addition, the ship contained numerous complete and incomplete copper bun-shaped ingots, rectangular tin bars, and Cypriot agricultural tools made of scrap bronze. Radiocarbon dating of brushwood from the ship gives an approximate date of 1200 BC.\n\nTypically the copper oxhide ingots are highly pure (approximately 99 weight percent copper) with trace element content of less than one weight percent. The few tin oxhide ingots that have been available to study are also exceptionally pure. Microscopic analysis of the Uluburun copper oxhide ingots reveals that they are highly porous. This feature results from the effervescence of gases as the molten metal cooled. Slag inclusions are also present. Their existence implies that slag was not fully removed from the smelted metal and thus that the ingots were made from remelted copper.\n\nMacroscopic observation of the Uluburun copper ingots indicates that they were cast through multiple pours; there are distinct layers of metal in each ingot. Furthermore, the relatively high weight and high purity of the ingots would be difficult to achieve even today in only one pour.\n\nThe porosity of the copper ingots and the natural brittleness of tin suggest that both metal ingots were easy to break. As Bass et al. proposes, a metalsmith could simply break off a piece of the ingot whenever he liked for a new casting.\n\nControversy has swirled around the provenance of the copper oxhide ingots. Lead isotope analysis (LIA) suggests that the late LBA ingots (that is, after 1250 BC) are composed of Cypriot copper, specifically copper from the Apilki mine and its surrounding area. The Gelidonya ingots’ ratios are consistent with Cypriot ores while the Uluburun ingots fall on the periphery of the Cypriot isotopic field. On the other hand, Late Minoan I ingots found on Crete have Paleozoic lead isotope ratios and are more consistent with ore sources in Afghanistan, Iran, or Central Asia. The controversy settles on the validity of LIA. Paul Budd argues that LBA copper is the product of such extensive mixing and recycling that LIA, which works best for metals from a single ore deposit, is unfeasible.\n\nSome scholars worry that the 1250 BC date is too limiting. They note that Cyprus was smelting copper on a large scale in the early LBA and had the potential to export the metal to Crete and other places at this time. Furthermore, copper ore is more plentiful on Cyprus than on Sardinia and far more plentiful than on Crete. Archaeologists have discovered numerous Cypriot exports to Sardinia including metalworking tools and prestige metal objects.\n\nDue to the heavy corrosion of tin oxhide ingots and the limited data for lead isotopic studies of tin, the provenance of the tin ingots has been uncertain. The fact that scholars have been unable to pinpoint Bronze Age tin ore deposits compounds this problem.\n\nA mold for casting an oxhide ingot was discovered in the LBA north palace at Ras Ibn Hani in Syria. It is made of fine-grained “ramleh,” a “shelly” limestone. Archaeologists found burnt copper droplets around the mold. In spite of the questionable durability of limestone, Paul Craddock et al. concluded that limestone can be used for casting “large simple shapes” such as oxhide ingots. Evolution of carbon dioxide from the limestone would damage the metal surface that touched the mold. Thus, metal objects requiring surface detail could not be produced successfully.\n\nThis is not to say that oxhide ingots were normally cast in limestone molds. Using an experimental clay mold, Bass et al. argue that the ingot's smooth side was in contact with the mold while its rough side was exposed to the atmosphere. The roughness results from the interaction of the atmosphere and the cooling metal.\n\nIn the Late Bronze Age, Cyprus produced numerous bronze stands that depicted a man carrying an oxhide ingot. The stands were designed to hold vases, and they were cast through the lost-wax process. The ingots show the familiar shape of four protruding handles, and the men carry them over their shoulders. These Cypriot stands were exported to Crete and Sardinia, and both islands created similar stands in local bronze workshops.\n\nWhile only one oxhide ingot fragment has been recovered from Egypt (in the context of a LBA smelting workshop), there is a wide array of painted scenes in Egypt that show oxhide ingots. The earliest scene dates to the 15th century BC and the latest scene to the 12th century BC. The ingots display their typical four protrusions, and red paint (which suggests they are copper) is preserved on them. The captions accompanying the scenes explain that the men who bring the ingots come from the north, specifically Retnu (Syria) and Keftiu (unidentified). They are shown being carried on the shoulders of men, sitting with other goods in storage, or as part of scenes in smelting workshops. In a relief from Karnak, the pharaoh Amenhotep II is seen riding a chariot and spearing an oxhide ingot with five arrows. A laudatory caption emphasizing the pharaoh’s strength accompanies the scene.\n\nSeveral of the “Amarna letters” dating to the mid-14th century BC refer to hundreds of copper talents—in addition to goods such as elephant tusks and glass ingots—sent from the kingdom of Alashiya to Egypt. Some scholars identify Cyprus with Alashiya. In particular, the Uluburun cargo is similar to the goods that, according to the letters, Alashiya sent to Egypt.\n\n"}
{"id": "2361047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2361047", "title": "Page layout", "text": "Page layout\n\nPage layout is the part of graphic design that deals in the arrangement of visual elements on a page. It generally involves organizational principles of composition to achieve specific communication objectives.\n\nThe high-level page layout involves deciding on the overall arrangement of text and images, and possibly on the size or shape of the medium. It requires intelligence, sentience, and creativity, and is informed by culture, psychology, and what the document authors and editors wish to communicate and emphasize. Low-level pagination and typesetting are more mechanical processes. Given certain parameters - boundaries of text areas, the typeface, font size, and justification preference can be done in a straightforward way. Until desktop publishing became dominant, these processes were still done by people, but in modern publishing they are almost always automated. The result might be published as-is (as for a residential phone book interior) or might be tweaked by a graphic designer (as for a highly polished, expensive publication) it is very important as it allows you to read a Magazine.\n\nBeginning from early illuminated pages in hand-copied books of the Middle Ages and proceeding down to intricate modern magazine and catalog layouts, proper page design has long been a consideration in printed material. With print media, elements usually consist of type (text), images (pictures), and occasionally place-holder graphics for elements that are not printed with ink such as die/laser cutting, foil stamping or blind embossing.\n\nWith manuscripts, all of the elements are added by hand, so the creator can determine the layout directly as they create the work, perhaps with an advance sketch as a guide.\n\nWith ancient woodblock printing, all elements of the page were carved directly into wood, though later layout decisions might need to be made if the printing was transferred onto a larger work, such as a large piece of fabric, potentially with multiple block impressions.\n\nWith the Renaissance invention of letterpress printing and cold-metal moveable type, typesetting was accomplished by physically assembling characters using a composing stick into a galley—a long tray. Any images would be created by engraving.\n\nThe original document would be a hand-written manuscript; if the typesetting was performed by someone other than the layout artist, markup would be added to the manuscript with instructions as to typeface, font size, and so on. (Even after authors began to use typewriters in the 1860s, originals were still called \"manuscripts\" and the markup process was the same.)\n\nAfter the first round of typesetting, a galley proof might be printed in order for proofreading to be performed, either to correct errors in the original, or to make sure that the typesetter had copied the manuscript properly, and correctly interpreted the markup. The final layout would be constructed in a \"form\" or \"forme\" using pieces of wood or metal (\"furniture\") to space out the text and images as desired, a frame known as a chase, and objects which lock down the frame known as quoins. This process is called imposition, and potentially includes arranging multiple pages to be printed on the same sheet of paper which will later be folded and possibly trimmed. An \"imposition proof\" (essentially a short run of the press) might be created to check the final placement.\n\nThe invention of hot metal typesetting in 1884 sped up the typesetting process by allowing workers to produce slugs—entire lines of text—using a keyboard. The slugs were the result of molten metal being poured into molds temporarily assembled by the typesetting machine. The layout process remained the same as with cold metal type, however: assembly into physical galleys.\n\nOffset lithography allows the bright and dark areas of an image (at first captured on film) to control ink placement on the printing press. This means that if a single copy of the page can be created on paper and photographed, then any number of copies could be printed. Type could be set with a typewriter, or to achieve professional results comparable to letterpress, a specialized typesetting machine. The IBM Selectric Composer, for example, could produce type of different size, different fonts (including proportional fonts), and with text justification. With photoengraving and halftone, physical photographs could be transferred into print directly, rather than relying on hand-made engravings.\n\nThe layout process then became the task of creating the paste up, so named because rubber cement or other adhesive would be used to physically paste images and columns of text onto a rigid sheet of paper. Completed pages become known as camera-ready, \"mechanical\" or \"mechanical art\".\n\nPhototypesetting was invented in 1945; after keyboard input, characters were shot one-by-one onto a photographic negative, which could then be sent to the print shop directly, or shot onto photographic paper for paste-up. These machines became increasingly sophisticated, with computer-driven models able to store text on magnetic tape.\n\nAs the graphics capabilities of computers matured, they began to be used to render characters, columns, pages, and even multi-page signatures directly, rather than simply summoning a photographic template from a pre-supplied set. In addition to being used as display devices for computer operators, cathode ray tubes were used to render text for phototypesetting. The curved nature of the CRT display however, led to distortions of text and art on the screen towards the outer edges of the screens. The advent of \"flat screen\" monitors (LCD, LED, and more recently OLED) in early 2010 eliminated the distortion problems caused by older CRT displays. As of 2016 flat panel displays have almost completely replaced CRT displays.\n\nPrinters attached directly to computers allowed them to print documents directly, in multiple copies or as an original which could be copied on a ditto machine or photocopier. WYSIWYG word processors made it possible for general office users and consumers to make more sophisticated page layouts, use text justification, and use more fonts than were possible with typewriters. Early dot matrix printing was sufficient for office documents, but was of too low a quality for professional typesetting. Inkjet printing and laser printing did produce sufficient quality type, and so computers with these types of printers quickly replaced phototypesetting machines.\n\nWith modern desktop publishing software such as flagship software Adobe Indesign and cloud-based Lucidpress, the layout process can occur entirely on-screen. (Similar layout options that would be available to a professional print shop making a paste-up are supported by desktop publishing software; in contrast, \"word processing\" software usually has a much more limited set of layout and typography choices available, trading off flexibility for ease of use for more common applications.) A finished document can be directly printed as the camera-ready version, with no physical assembly required (given a big enough printer). Greyscale images must be either half toned digitally if being sent to an offset press, or sent separately for the print shop to insert into marked areas. Completed works can also be transmitted digitally to the print shop, who may print it themselves, shoot it directly to film, or use computer to plate technology to skip the physical original entirely. PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF) have become standard file formats for digital transmission.\n\nSince the advent of personal computing, page layout skills have expanded to electronic media as well as print media. E-books, PDF documents, and static web pages mirror paper documents relatively closely, but computers can also add multimedia animation, and interactivity. Page layout for interactive media overlaps with interface design and user experience design; an interactive \"page\" is better known as a graphical user interface (GUI).\n\nModern web pages are typically produced using HTML for content and general structure, cascading style sheets to control presentation details such as typography and spacing, and JavaScript for interactivity. Since these languages are all text-based, this work can be done in a text editor, or a special HTML editor which may have WYSIWYG features or other aids. Additional technologies such as Macromedia Flash may be used for multimedia content. Web developers are responsible for actually creating a finished document using these technologies, but a separate web designer may be responsible for establishing the layout. A given web designer might be a fluent web developer as well, or may merely be familiar with the general capabilities of the technologies and merely visualize the desired result for the development team.\n\nProjected slides used in presentations or entertainment often have similar layout considerations to printed pages.\n\nThe magic lantern and opaque projector were used during lectures in the 1800s, using printed, typed, photographed, or hand-drawn originals. Two sets of photographic film (one negative and one positive) or one reversal film can be used to create positive images that can be projected with light passing through. Intertitles were used extensively in the earliest motion pictures when sound was not available; they are still used occasionally in addition to the ubiquitous vanity cards and credits.\n\nIt became popular to use transparent film for presentations (with opaque text and images) using overhead projectors in the 1940s, and slide projectors in the 1950s. Transparencies for overhead projectors could be printed by some photocopiers. Computer presentation programs became available in the 1980s, making it possible to lay out a presentation digitally. Computer-developed presentations could be printed to a transparency with some laser printers, transferred to slides, or projected directly using LCD overhead projectors. Modern presentations are often displayed digitally using a video projector, computer monitor, or large-screen television.\n\nLaying out a presentation presents slightly different challenges than a print document, especially because a person will typically be speaking and referring to the projected pages. Consideration might be given to:\n\nGrids and templates are page layout design patterns used in advertising campaigns and multiple-page publications, including websites.\n\nA grid is a set of guidelines, able to be seen in the design process and invisible to the end-user/audience, for aligning and repeating elements on a page. A page layout may or may not stay within those guidelines, depending on how much repetition or variety the design style in the series calls for. Grids are meant to be flexible. Using a grid to lay out elements on the page may require just as much or more graphic design skill than that which was required to design the grid.\n\nIn contrast, a template is more rigid. A template involves repeated elements mostly visible to the end-user/audience. Using a template to lay out elements usually involves less graphic design skill than that which was required to design the template. Templates are used for minimal modification of background elements and frequent modification (or swapping) of foreground content.\n\nMost desktop publishing software allows for grids in the form of a page filled with coloured lines or dots placed at a specified equal horizontal and vertical distance apart. Automatic margins and booklet spine (gutter) lines may be specified for global use throughout the document. Multiple additional horizontal and vertical lines may be placed at any point on the page. Invisible to the end-user/audience shapes may be placed on the page as guidelines for page layout and print processing as well. Software templates are achieved by duplicating a template data file, or with master page features in a multiple-page document. Master pages may include both grid elements and template elements such as header and footer elements, automatic page numbering, and automatic table of contents features.\n\nStatic layouts allow for more control over the aesthetics, and thorough optimization of space around and overlapping irregular-shaped content than dynamic layouts. In web design, this is sometimes referred to as a fixed width layout; but the entire layout may be scalable in size while still maintaining the original proportions, static placement, and style of the content. All raster image formats are static layouts in effect; but a static layout may include searchable text by separating the text from the graphics.\n\nIn contrast, electronic pages allow for dynamic layouts with swapping content, personalization of styles, text scaling, image scaling, or reflowable content with variable page sizes often referred to as fluid or liquid layout. Dynamic layouts are more likely to separate presentation from content, which comes with its own advantages. A dynamic layout lays out all text and images into rectangular areas of rows and columns. As these areas' widths and heights are defined to be percentages of the available screen, they are responsive to varying screen dimensions. They'll automatically ensure maximized use of available space while always staying adapted optimally both on screen resizes and hardware-given restrictions. Text may freely be resized to provide users' individual needs on legibility while never disturbing a given layout's proportions. The content's overall arrangement on screen this way may always remain as it was originally designed.\n\nStatic layout design may involve more graphic design and visual art skills, whereas dynamic layout design may involve more interactive design and content management skills to thoroughly anticipate content variation.\n\nMotion graphics don't fit neatly into either category, but may involve layout skills or careful consideration of how the motion may affect the layout. In either case, the element of motion makes it a dynamic layout, but one that warrants motion graphic design more than static graphic design or interactive design.\n\nElectronic pages may utilize both static and dynamic layout features by dividing the pages or by combining the effects. For example, a section of the page such as a web banner may contain static or motion graphics contained within a swapping content area. Dynamic or live text may be wrapped around irregular shaped images by using invisible spacers to push the text away from the edges. Some computer algorithms can detect the edges of an object that contain transparency and flow content around contours.\n\nWith modern media content retrieval and output technology, there is much overlap between visual communications (front-end) and information technology (back-end). Large print publications (thick books, especially instructional in nature) and electronic pages (web pages) require meta data for automatic indexing, automatic reformatting, database publishing, dynamic page display and end-user interactivity. Much of the meta data (meta tags) must be hand coded or specified during the page layout process. This divides the task of page layout between artists and engineers, or tasks the artist/engineer to do both.\n\nMore complex projects may require two separate designs: page layout design as the front-end, and function coding as the back-end. In this case, the front-end may be designed using an alternative page layout technology such as image editing software or on paper with hand rendering methods. Most image editing software includes features for converting a page layout for use in a \"What You See Is What You Get\" (WYSIWYG) editor or features to export graphics for desktop publishing software. WYSIWYG editors and desktop publishing software allow front-end design prior to back-end coding in most cases. Interface design and database publishing may involve more technical knowledge or collaboration with information technology engineering in the front-end. Sometimes, a function on the back-end is to automate the retrieval and arrangement of content on the front-end.\n\nPage layout might be prescribed to a greater or lesser degree by a house style which might be implemented in a specific desktop publishing template. There might also be relatively little layout to do in comparison to the amount of pagination (as in novels and other books with no figures).\n\nTypical page layout decisions include:\n\nSpecific elements to be laid out might include:\n\nIn newspaper production, final selection and cropping of photographs accompanying stories might be left to the layout editor (since the choice of photo could affect the shape of the area needed, and thus the rest of the layout), or there might be a separate photo editor. Likewise, headlines might be written by the layout editor, a copy editor, or the original author.\n\nTo make stories fit the final layout, relatively inconsequential copy tweaks might be made (for example, rephrasing for brevity), or the layout editor might make slight adjustments to typography elements like font size or leading.\n\nA floating block in writing and publishing is any graphic, text, table, or other representation that is unaligned from the main flow of text. Use of floating blocks to present pictures and tables is a typical feature of academic writing and technical writing, including scientific articles and books. Floating blocks are normally labeled with a caption or title that describes its contents and a number that is used to refer to the figure from the main text. A common system divides floating block into two separately numbered series, labeled \"figure\" (for pictures, diagrams, plots, etc.) and \"table\". An alternative name for figure is image or graphic.\n\nFloating blocks are said to be \"floating\" because they are not fixed in position on the page at the place, but rather drift to the side of the page. By placing pictures or other large items on the sides of pages rather than embedding them in the middle of the main flow of text, typesetting is more flexible and interruption to the flow of the narrative is avoided.\n\nFor example, an article on geography might have \"Figure 1: Map of the world\", \"Figure 2: Map of Europe\", \"Table 1: Population of continents\", \"Table 2: Population of European countries\", and so on. Some books will have a table of figures—in addition to the table of contents—that lists centrally all the figures appearing in the work.\n\nOther kinds of floating blocks may be differentiated as well, for example:\n\nA mockup of a layout might be created to get early feedback, usually before all the content is actually ready. Whether for paper or electronic media, the first draft of a layout might be simply a rough paper and pencil sketch. A comprehensive layout for a new magazine might show placeholders for text and images, but demonstrate placement, typographic style, and other idioms intended to set the pattern for actual issues, or a particular unfinished issue. A website wireframe is a low-cost way to show layout without doing all the work of creating the final HTML and CSS, and without writing the copy or creating any images.\n\nLorem ipsum text is often used to avoid the embarrassment any improvised sample copy might cause if accidentally published. Likewise, placeholder images are often labelled \"for position only\".\n\n"}

{"id": "369155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369155", "title": "Roaring Twenties", "text": "Roaring Twenties\n\nThe Roaring Twenties refers to the decade of the 1920s in Western society and Western culture. It was a period of economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States and Western Europe, particularly in major cities such as Berlin, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, New York City, Paris, and Sydney. In France, the decade was known as the \"années folles\" ('crazy years'), emphasizing the era's social, artistic and cultural dynamism. Jazz blossomed, the flapper redefined the modern look for British and American women, and Art Deco peaked. Not everything roared: in the wake of the hyper-emotional patriotism of World War I, Warren G. Harding \"brought back normalcy\" to the politics of the United States. This period saw the large-scale development and use of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, radio, and electrical appliances. Aviation became a business. Nations saw rapid industrial and economic growth, accelerated consumer demand, and significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media focused on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars, as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums. In most major democratic states, women won the right to vote.\n\nThe social and cultural features known as the Roaring Twenties began in leading metropolitan centers, then spread widely in the aftermath of World War I. The United States gained dominance in world finance. Thus, when Germany could no longer afford to pay World War I reparations to the United Kingdom, France and the other Allied powers, the United States came up with the Dawes Plan, named after banker, and later 30th Vice President, Charles G. Dawes. Wall Street invested heavily in Germany, which paid its reparations to countries that, in turn, used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington. By the middle of the decade, prosperity was widespread, with the second half of the decade known, especially in Germany, as the \"Golden Twenties\".\n\nThe spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of novelty associated with modernity and a break with tradition. Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology. New technologies, especially automobiles, moving pictures, and radio, brought \"modernity\" to a large part of the population. Formal decorative frills were shed in favor of practicality in both daily life and architecture. At the same time, jazz and dancing rose in popularity, in opposition to the mood of World War I. As such, the period is also often referred to as the Jazz Age.\n\nThe Wall Street Crash of 1929 ended the era, as the Great Depression brought years of hardship worldwide.\n\nThe Roaring Twenties was a decade of economic growth and widespread prosperity, driven by recovery from wartime devastation and deferred spending, a boom in construction, and the rapid growth of consumer goods such as automobiles and electricity in North America and Western Europe and a few other developed countries such as Australia. The economy of the United States, which had successfully transitioned from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy, boomed and provided loans for a European boom as well. Some sectors stagnated, especially farming and coal mining. The US became the richest country in the world per capita and since the late-19th century had been the largest in total GDP. Its industry was based on mass production, and its society acculturated into consumerism. European economies, by contrast, had a more difficult postwar readjustment and did not begin to flourish until about 1924.\n\nAt first, the end of wartime production caused a brief but deep recession, the post–World War I recession of 1919–20. Quickly, however, the US and Canadian economies rebounded as returning soldiers re-entered the labor force and munitions factories were retooled to produce consumer goods.\n\nMass production made technology affordable to the middle class.\n\nThe automotive industry, the film industry, the radio industry, and the chemical industry took off during the 1920s. Of chief importance was the automotive industry. Before the war, cars were a luxury good. In the 1920s, mass-produced vehicles became commonplace in the US and Canada. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company discontinued the Ford Model T after selling 15 million units of that model. It had been in continuous production from October 1908 to May 1927. The company planned to replace the old model with a newer one, the Ford Model A. The decision was a reaction to competition. Due to the commercial success of the Model T, Ford had dominated the automotive market from the mid-1910s to the early-1920s. In the mid-1920s, Ford's dominance eroded as its competitors had caught up with Ford's mass production system. They began to surpass Ford in some areas, offering models with more powerful engines, new convenience features, and styling.\n\nOnly about 300,000 vehicles were registered in 1918 in all of Canada, but by 1929, there were 1.9 million, and automobile parts were being manufactured in Ontario, near Detroit, Michigan. The automotive industry's influence on other segments of the economy were widespread, jump starting industries such as steel production, highway building, motels, service stations, car dealerships, and new housing outside the urban core.\n\nFord opened factories around the world and proved a strong competitor in most markets for its low-cost, easy-maintenance vehicles. General Motors, to a lesser degree, followed. European competitors avoided the low-price market and concentrated on more expensive vehicles for upscale consumers.\n\nRadio became the first mass broadcasting medium. Radios were expensive, but their mode of entertainment proved revolutionary. Radio advertising became a platform for mass marketing. Its economic importance led to the mass culture that has dominated society since this period. During the \"Golden Age of Radio\", radio programming was as varied as the Television programming of the 21st century. The 1927 establishment of the Federal Radio Commission introduced a new era of regulation.\n\nIn 1925, electrical recording, one of the greatest advances in sound recording, became available with commercially-issued gramophone records.\n\nThe cinema boomed, producing a new form of entertainment that virtually ended the old vaudeville theatrical genre. Watching a film was cheap and accessible; crowds surged into new downtown movie palaces and neighborhood theaters. Since the early 1910s, lower-priced cinema successfully competed with vaudeville. Many vaudeville performers and other theatrical personalities were recruited by the film industry, lured by greater salaries and less arduous working conditions. The introduction of the sound film at the end of the decade of the 1920s eliminated vaudeville's last major advantage. Vaudeville was in sharp financial decline. The prestigious Orpheum Circuit, a chain of vaudeville and movie theaters, was absorbed by a new film studio.\n\nIn 1923, inventor Lee de Forest at Phonofilm released a number of short films with sound. Meanwhile, inventor Theodore Case developed the Movietone sound system and sold the rights to the film studio, Fox Film. In 1926, the Vitaphone sound system was introduced. The feature film \"Don Juan\" (1926) was the first feature-length film to use the Vitaphone sound system with a synchronized musical score and sound effects, though it had no spoken dialogue. The film was released by the film studio Warner Bros. In October 1927, the sound film \"The Jazz Singer\" (1927) turned out to be a smash box office success. It was innovative for its use of sound. Produced with the Vitaphone system, most of the film does not contain live-recorded audio, relying on a score and effects. When the movie's star, Al Jolson, sings, however, the film shifts to sound recorded on the set, including both his musical performances and two scenes with ad-libbed speech—one of Jolson's character, Jakie Rabinowitz (Jack Robin), addressing a cabaret audience; the other an exchange between he and his mother. The \"natural\" sounds of the settings were also audible. The film's profits were proof enough to the film industry that the technology was worth investing in.\n\nIn 1928, the film studios Famous Players-Lasky (later known as Paramount Pictures), First National Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Universal Studios signed an agreement with Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI) for the conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film. Initially, all ERPI-wired theaters were made Vitaphone-compatible; most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well. Also in 1928, Radio Corporation of America (RCA) marketed a new sound system, the RCA Photophone system. RCA offered the rights to its system to the subsidiary RKO Pictures. Warner Bros. continued releasing a few films with live dialogue, though only in a few scenes. It finally released \"Lights of New York\" (1928), the first all-talking full-length feature film. The animated short film \"Dinner Time\" (1928) by the Van Beuren Studios was among the first animated sound films. It was followed a few months later by the animated short film \"Steamboat Willie\" (1928), the first sound film by the Walt Disney Animation Studios. It was the first commercially successful animated short film and introduced the character Mickey Mouse.\"Steamboat Willie\" was the first cartoon to feature a fully post-produced soundtrack, which distinguished it from earlier sound cartoons. It became the most popular cartoon of its day.\n\nFor much of 1928, Warner Bros. was the only studio to release talking features. It profited from its innovative films at the box office. Other studios quickened the pace of their conversion to the new technology and started producing their own sound films and talking films. In February 1929, sixteen months after \"The Jazz Singer\", Columbia Pictures became the eighth and last major studio to release a talking feature. In May 1929, Warner Bros. released \"On with the Show!\" (1929), the first all-color, all-talking feature film. Soon silent film production ceased. The last totally silent feature produced in the US for general distribution was \"The Poor Millionaire\", released by Biltmore Pictures in April 1930. Four other silent features, all low-budget Westerns, were also released in early-1930.\n\nThe 1920s saw milestones in aviation that seized the world's attention. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh rose to fame with the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight. He took off from Roosevelt Field in New York and landed at Paris–Le Bourget Airport. It took Lindbergh 33.5 hours to cross the Atlantic Ocean. His aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis, was a custom-built, single engine, single-seat monoplane. It was designed by aeronautical engineer Donald A. Hall. In Britain Amy Johnson (1903–1941) was the first woman to fly alone from Britain to Australia. Flying solo or with her husband, Jim Mollison, she set numerous long-distance records during the 1930s.\n\nThe 1920s saw several inventors advance work on television, but programs did not reach the public until the eve of the Second World War, and few people saw any television before the late-1940s.\n\nIn July 1928, John Logie Baird demonstrated the world's first color transmission, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with a filter of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a commutator to alternate their illumination. That same year he also demonstrated stereoscopic television.\n\nIn 1927, Baird transmitted a long-distance television signal over of telephone line between London and Glasgow; Baird transmitted the world's first long-distance television pictures to the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central Station. Baird then set up the Baird Television Development Company Ltd, which in 1928 made the first transatlantic television transmission, from London to Hartsdale, New York, and the first television programme for the BBC.\n\nFor decades biologists had been at work on the medicine that became penicillin. In 1928, Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming discovered a substance that killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. In 1929, he named the new substance \"penicillin\". His publications were largely ignored at first, but it became a significant antibiotic in the 1930s. In 1930, Cecil George Paine, a pathologist at Sheffield Royal Infirmary, used penicillin to treat sycosis barbae, eruptions in beard follicles, but was unsuccessful. Moving on to ophthalmia neonatorum, a gonococcal infection in infants, he achieved the first recorded cure with penicillin, on November 25, 1930. He then cured four additional patients (one adult and three infants) of eye infections, but failed to cure a fifth.\n\nThe automobile's dominance led to a new psychology celebrating mobility. Cars and trucks needed road construction, new bridges, and regular highway maintenance, largely funded by local and state government through taxes on gasoline. Farmers were early adopters as they used their pickups to haul people, supplies and animals. New industries were spun off—to make tires and glass and refine fuel, and to service and repair cars and trucks by the millions. New car dealers were franchised by the car makers and became prime movers in the local business community. Tourism gained an enormous boost, with hotels, restaurants and curio shops proliferating.\n\nElectrification, having slowed during the war, progressed greatly as more of the US and Canada was added to the electrical grid. Industries switched from coal power to electricity. At the same time, new power plants were constructed. In America, electricity production almost quadrupled.\n\nTelephone lines also were being strung across the continent. Indoor plumbing and modern sewer systems were installed for the first time in many houses.\n\nUrbanization reached a milestone in the 1920 census, that showed slightly more Americans lived in urban areas towns and cities of 2,500 or more people than in small towns or rural areas. However, the nation was fascinated with its great metropolitan centers that contained about 15 percent of the population. New York and Chicago vied in building skyscrapers, and New York pulled ahead with the Empire State Building. The basic pattern of the modern white-collar job was set during the late-19th century, but it now became the norm for life in large and medium cities. Typewriters, filing cabinets, and telephones brought unmarried women into clerical jobs. In Canada, by the end of the decade one in five workers was a woman. Interest in finding jobs in the now ever-growing manufacturing sector in US cities became widespread among rural Americans.\n\nWith some exceptions, many countries expanded women's voting rights in representative and direct democracies across the world such as the United States, Canada, Great Britain and most major European countries in 1917–1921, as well as India. This influenced many governments and elections by increasing the number of voters. Politicians responded by focusing more on issues of concern to women, especially peace, public health, education, and the status of children. On the whole, women voted much like men, except they were more interested in peace.\n\nThe Lost Generation was composed of young people who came out of World War I disillusioned and cynical about the world. The term usually refers to American literary notables who lived in Paris at the time. Famous members included Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Gertrude Stein. These authors, some of them expatriates, wrote novels and short stories expressing their resentment towards the materialism and individualism rampant during this era.\n\nIn England, the bright young things were young aristocrats and socialites who threw fancy dress parties, went on elaborate treasure hunts, were seen in all the trendy venues, and were well covered by the gossip columns of the London tabloids.\n\nAs the average American in the 1920s became more enamored of wealth and everyday luxuries, some began satirizing the hypocrisy and greed they observed. Of these social critics, Sinclair Lewis was the most popular. His popular 1920 novel \"Main Street\" satirized the dull and ignorant lives of the residents of a Midwestern town. He followed with \"Babbitt\", about a middle-aged businessman who rebels against his dull life and family, only to realize that the younger generation is as hypocritical as his own. Lewis satirized religion with \"Elmer Gantry\", which followed a con man who teams up with an evangelist to sell religion to a small town.\n\nOther social critics included Sherwood Anderson, Edith Wharton, and H.L. Mencken. Anderson published a collection of short stories titled \"Winesburg, Ohio\", which studied the dynamics of a small town. Wharton mocked the fads of the new era through her novels, such as \"Twilight Sleep\" (1927). Mencken criticized narrow American tastes and culture in essays and articles.\n\nArt Deco was the style of design and architecture that marked the era. Originating in Europe, it spread to the rest of western Europe and North America towards the mid-1920s.\n\nIn the US, one of the most remarkable buildings featuring this style was constructed as the tallest building of the time: the Chrysler Building. The forms of art deco were pure and geometric, though the artists often drew inspiration from nature. In the beginning, lines were curved, though rectilinear designs would later become more and more popular.\n\nPainting in North America during the 1920s developed in a different direction from that of Europe. In Europe, the 1920s were the era of expressionism, and later surrealism. As Man Ray stated in 1920 after the publication of a unique issue of \"New York Dada\": \"Dada cannot live in New York\".\n\nAt the beginning of the decade, films were silent and colorless. In 1922, the first all-color feature, \"The Toll of the Sea\", was released. In 1926, Warner Bros. released \"Don Juan\", the first feature with sound effects and music. In 1927, Warner released \"The Jazz Singer\", the first sound feature to include limited talking sequences.\n\nThe public went wild for talkies, and movie studios converted to sound almost overnight. In 1928, Warner released \"Lights of New York\", the first all-talking feature film. In the same year, the first sound cartoon, \"Dinner Time\", was released. Warner ended the decade by unveiling, in 1929, the first all-color, all-talking feature film, \"On with the Show\".\n\nCartoon shorts were popular in movie theaters during this time. In the late 1920s, Walt Disney emerged. Mickey Mouse made his debut in \"Steamboat Willie\" on November 18, 1928, at the Colony Theater in New York City. Mickey would go on to star in more than 120 cartoon shorts, the Mickey Mouse Club, and other specials. This would jump-start Disney and lead to creation of other characters going into the 1930s.\nOswald, a character created by Disney, before Mickey, in 1927, was contracted by Universal for distribution purposes, and starred in a series of shorts between 1927 and 1928. Disney lost the rights to the character, but in 2006, regained the rights to Oswald. He was the first Disney character to be merchandised.\n\nThe period had the emergence of box-office draws such as Mae Murray, Ramón Novarro, Rudolph Valentino, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Warner Baxter, Clara Bow, Louise Brooks, Bebe Daniels, Billie Dove, Dorothy Mackaill, Mary Astor, Nancy Carroll, Janet Gaynor, Charles Farrell, William Haines, Conrad Nagel, John Gilbert, Greta Garbo, Dolores del Río, Norma Talmadge, Colleen Moore, Nita Naldi, John Barrymore, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Anna May Wong, and Al Jolson.\n\nAfrican-American literary and artistic culture developed rapidly during the 1920s under the banner of the \"Harlem Renaissance\". In 1921, the Black Swan Corporation was founded. At its height, it issued 10 recordings per month. All-African American musicals also started in 1921. In 1923, the Harlem Renaissance Basketball Club was founded by Bob Douglas. During the late-1920s, and especially in the 1930s, the basketball team became known as the best in the world.\n\nThe first issue of \"\" was published. The African American playwright, Willis Richardson, debuted his play \"The Chip Woman's Fortune\", at the Frazee Theatre (also known as the Wallacks theatre). Notable African American authors such as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston began to achieve a level of national public recognition during the 1920s.\n\nThe 1920s brought new styles of music into the mainstream of culture in avant-garde cities. Jazz became the most popular form of music for youth. Historian Kathy J. Ogren says that by the 1920s jazz had become the \"dominant influence on America's popular music generally.\" Scott DeVeaux argues that a standard history of jazz has emerged such that: \"After an obligatory nod to African origins and ragtime antecedents, the music is shown to move through a succession of styles or periods: New Orleans jazz up through the 1920s, swing in the 1930s, bebop in the 1940s, cool jazz and hard bop in the 1950s, free jazz and fusion in the 1960s... There is substantial agreement on the defining features of each style, the pantheon of great innovators, and the canon of recorded masterpieces.\"\n\nThe pantheon of performers and singers from the 1920s include Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Sidney Bechet, Jelly Roll Morton, Joe \"King\" Oliver, James P. Johnson, Fletcher Henderson, Frankie Trumbauer, Paul Whiteman, Bix Beiderbecke, Adelaide Hall and Bing Crosby. The development of urban and city blues also began in the 1920s with performers such as Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey. In the latter part of the decade, early forms of country music were pioneered by Jimmie Rodgers, The Carter Family, Uncle Dave Macon, Vernon Dalhart, and Charlie Poole.\n\nDance clubs became enormously popular in the 1920s. Their popularity peaked in the late 1920s and reached into the early 1930s. Dance music came to dominate all forms of popular music by the late 1920s. Classical pieces, operettas, folk music, etc., were all transformed into popular dancing melodies to satiate the public craze for dancing much as the disco phenomenon later did in the late 1970s. For example, many of the songs from the 1929 Technicolor musical operetta \"The Rogue Song\" (starring the Metropolitan Opera star Lawrence Tibbett) were rearranged and released as dancing music and became popular dance club hits in 1929.\n\nDance clubs across the US-sponsored dancing contests, where dancers invented, tried and competed with new moves. Professionals began to hone their skills in tap dance and other dances of the era throughout the stage circuit across the United States. With the advent of talking pictures (sound film), musicals became all the rage and film studios flooded the box office with extravagant and lavish musical films. The representative was the musicals \"Gold Diggers of Broadway\", which became the highest-grossing film of the decade. Harlem played a key role in the development of dance styles. Several entertainment venues attracted people of all races. The Cotton Club featured black performers and catered to a white clientele, while the Savoy Ballroom catered to a mostly black clientele. Some religious moralists preached against \"Satan in the dance hall\" but had little impact.\n\nThe most popular dances throughout the decade were the foxtrot, waltz, and American tango. From the early 1920s, however, a variety of eccentric novelty dances were developed. The first of these were the Breakaway and Charleston. Both were based on African American musical styles and beats, including the widely popular blues. The Charleston's popularity exploded after its feature in two 1922 Broadway shows. A brief Black Bottom craze, originating from the Apollo Theater, swept dance halls from 1926 to 1927, replacing the Charleston in popularity. By 1927, the Lindy Hop, a dance based on Breakaway and Charleston and integrating elements of tap, became the dominant social dance. Developed in the Savoy Ballroom, it was set to stride piano ragtime jazz. The Lindy Hop later evolved into other Swing dances. These dances, nonetheless, never became mainstream, and the overwhelming majority of people in Western Europe and the U.S. continued to dance the foxtrot, waltz, and tango throughout the decade.\n\nThe dance craze had a large influence on popular music. Large numbers of recordings labeled as foxtrot, tango, and waltz were produced and gave rise to a generation of performers who became famous as recording artists or radio artists. Top vocalists included Nick Lucas, Adelaide Hall, Scrappy Lambert, Frank Munn, Lewis James, Chester Gaylord, Gene Austin, James Melton, Franklyn Baur, Johnny Marvin, Annette Hanshaw, Helen Kane, Vaughn De Leath, and Ruth Etting. Leading dance orchestra leaders included Bob Haring, Harry Horlick, Louis Katzman, Leo Reisman, Victor Arden, Phil Ohman, George Olsen, Ted Lewis, Abe Lyman, Ben Selvin, Nat Shilkret, Fred Waring, and Paul Whiteman.\n\nParis set the fashion trends for Europe and North America. The fashion for women was all about getting loose. Women wore dresses all day, everyday. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Daywear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleaded, hank hem, or tired. Jewelry was less conspicuous. Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.\n\nFor men in white collar jobs, business suits were the day to day attire. Striped, plaid, or windowpane suits came in dark gray, blue, and brown in the winter and ivory, white, tan, and pastels in the summer. Shirts were white and neckties were essential.\n\nImmortalized in movies and magazine covers, young women's fashions of the 1920s set both a trend and social statement, a breaking-off from the rigid Victorian way of life. These young, rebellious, middle-class women, labeled 'flappers' by older generations, did away with the corset and donned slinky knee-length dresses, which exposed their legs and arms. The hairstyle of the decade was a chin-length bob, which had several popular variations. Cosmetics, which until the 1920s were not typically accepted in American society because of their association with prostitution, became, for the first time, extremely popular.\n\nIn the 1920s new magazines appealed to young German women with a sensuous image and advertisements for the appropriate clothes and accessories they would want to purchase. The glossy pages of \"Die Dame\" and \"Das Blatt der Hausfrau\" displayed the \"Neue Frauen,\" \"New Girl\" – what Americans called the flapper. She was young and fashionable, financially independent, and was an eager consumer of the latest fashions. The magazines kept her up to date on styles, clothes, designers, arts, sports, and modern technology such as automobiles and telephones.\n\nThe 1920s was a period of social revolution, coming out of World War I, society changed as inhibitions faded and youth demanded new experiences and more freedom from old controls. Chaperones faded in importance as \"anything goes\" became a slogan for youth taking control of their subculture. A new woman was born—a \"flapper\" who danced, drank, smoked and voted. This new woman cut her hair, wore make-up, and partied. She was known for being giddy and taking risks; she was known as a flapper. Women gained the right to vote in most countries. New careers opened for single women in offices and schools, with salaries that helped them to be more independent. With their desire for freedom and independence came change in fashion. One of the most dramatic post-war changes in fashion was the woman's silhouette; the dress length went from floor length to ankle and knee length, becoming more bold and seductive. The new dress code emphasized youth: corsets were left behind and clothing was looser, with more natural lines. The hourglass figure was not popular anymore, whereas a slimmer, boyish body type was considered appealing. The flappers were known for this and for their high spirits, flirtatiousness, and stereotypical recklessness when it came to their search for fun and thrills.\n\nCoco Chanel was one of the most enigmatic fashion figures of the 1920s. She was recognized for her avant-garde designs; her clothing was a mixture of wearable, comfortable, and elegant. She was the one to introduce a different aesthetic into fashion, especially a different sense for what was feminine, and based her design on new ethics; she designed for an active woman, one that could feel at ease in her dress. Chanel's primary goal was to empower freedom. She was the pioneer for women wearing pants and for the little black dress, which were signs of a more independent lifestyle.\n\nMost British historians depict the 1920s as an era of domesticity for women with little feminist progress, apart from full suffrage which came in 1928. On the contrary, argues Alison Light, literary sources reveal that many British women enjoyed:\n\nWith the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, that gave women the right to vote, American feminists attained the political equality they had been waiting for. A generational gap began to form between the \"new\" women of the 1920s and the previous generation. Prior to the 19th Amendment, feminists commonly thought women could not pursue both a career and a family successfully, believing one would inherently inhibit the development of the other. This mentality began to change in the 1920s, as more women began to desire not only successful careers of their own, but also families. The \"new\" woman was less invested in social service than the Progressive generations, and in tune with the consumerist spirit of the era, she was eager to compete and to find personal fulfillment. \nHigher education was rapidly expanding for women. Linda Eisenmann claims, \"New collegiate opportunities for women profoundly redefined womanhood by challenging the Victorian belief that men's and women's social roles were rooted in biology.\"\n\nAdvertising agencies exploited the new status of women, for example in publishing automobile ads in women's magazines, at a time when the vast majority of purchasers and drivers were men. The new ads promoted new freedoms for affluent women while also suggesting the outer limits of the new freedoms. Automobiles were more than practical devices. They were also highly visible symbols of affluence, mobility, and modernity. The ads, says Einav Rabinovitch-Fox, \"offered women a visual vocabulary to imagine their new social and political roles as citizens and to play an active role in shaping their identity as modern women.\"\n\nSignificant changes in the lives of working women occurred in the 1920s. World War I had temporarily allowed women to enter into industries such as chemical, automobile, and iron and steel manufacturing, which were once deemed inappropriate work for women. Black women, who had been historically closed out of factory jobs, began to find a place in industry during World War I by accepting lower wages and replacing the lost immigrant labor and in heavy work. Yet, like other women during World War I, their success was only temporary; most black women were also pushed out of their factory jobs after the war. In 1920, 75% of the black female labor force consisted of agricultural laborers, domestic servants, and laundry workers.\n\nLegislation passed at the beginning of the 20th century mandated a minimum wage and forced many factories to shorten their workdays. This shifted the focus in the 1920s to job performance to meet demand. Factories encouraged workers to produce more quickly and efficiently with speedups and bonus systems, increasing the pressure on factory workers. Despite the strain on women in the factories, the booming economy of the 1920s meant more opportunities even for the lower classes. Many young girls from working class backgrounds did not need to help support their families as prior generations did and were often encouraged to seek work or receive vocational training which would result in social mobility.\n\nThe achievement of suffrage led to feminists refocusing their efforts towards other goals. Groups such as the National Women's Party continued the political fight, proposing the Equal Rights Amendment in 1923 and working to remove laws that used sex to discriminate against women, but many women shifted their focus from politics to challenge traditional definitions of womanhood.\n\nYoung women, especially, began staking claim to their own bodies and took part in a sexual liberation of their generation. Many of the ideas that fueled this change in sexual thought were already floating around New York intellectual circles prior to World War I, with the writings of Sigmund Freud, Havelock Ellis and Ellen Key. There, thinkers claimed that sex was not only central to the human experience, but also that women were sexual beings with human impulses and desires, and restraining these impulses was self-destructive. By the 1920s, these ideas had permeated the mainstream.\n\nIn the 1920s, the co-ed emerged, as women began attending large state colleges and universities. Women entered into the mainstream middle class experience but took on a gendered role within society. Women typically took classes such as home economics, \"Husband and Wife\", \"Motherhood\" and \"The Family as an Economic Unit\". In an increasingly conservative postwar era, a young woman commonly would attend college with the intention of finding a suitable husband. Fueled by ideas of sexual liberation, dating underwent major changes on college campuses. With the advent of the automobile, courtship occurred in a much more private setting. \"Petting\", sexual relations without intercourse, became the social norm for a portion of college students.\n\nDespite women's increased knowledge of pleasure and sex, the decade of unfettered capitalism that was the 1920s gave birth to the 'feminine mystique'. With this formulation, all women wanted to marry, all good women stayed at home with their children, cooking and cleaning, and the best women did the aforementioned and in addition, exercised their purchasing power freely and as frequently as possible to better their families and their homes.\n\nThe Allied victory in the First World War seems to mark the triumph of liberalism, not just in the Allied countries themselves, but also in Germany and in the new states of Eastern Europe, as well as Japan. Authoritarian militarism as typified by Germany had been defeated and discredited. Historian Martin Blinkhorn argues that the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of \"cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free-market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the League of Nations.\" However, as early as 1917, the emerging liberal order was being challenged by the new communist movement taking inspiration from the Russian Revolution. Communist revolts were beaten back everywhere else, but they did succeed in Russia.\n\nHomosexuality became much more visible and somewhat more acceptable. London, New York, Paris, Rome, and Berlin were important centers of the new ethic. Crouthamel argues that in Germany, the First World War promoted homosexual emancipation because it provided an ideal of comradeship which redefined homosexuality and masculinity. The many gay rights groups in Weimar Germany favored a militarised rhetoric with a vision of a spiritually and politically emancipated hypermasculine gay man who fought to legitimize \"friendship\" and secure civil rights. Ramsey explores several variations. On the left, the \"Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee\" (Scientific-Humanitarian Committee; WhK) reasserted the traditional view that homosexuals were an effeminate \"third sex\" whose sexual ambiguity and nonconformity was biologically determined. The radical nationalist \"Gemeinschaft der Eigenen\" (Community of the Self-Owned) proudly proclaimed homosexuality as heir to the manly German and classical Greek traditions of homoerotic male bonding, which enhanced the arts and glorified relationships with young men. The politically centrist \"Bund für Menschenrecht\" (League for Human Rights) engaged in a struggle for human rights, advising gays to live in accordance with the mores of middle-class German respectability.\n\nHumor was used to assist in acceptability. One popular American song, \"Masculine Women, Feminine Men\", was released in 1926 and recorded by numerous artists of the day; it included these lyrics:\n\n\"Masculine women, Feminine men\"<br>\n\"Which is the rooster, which is the hen?\"<br>\n\"It's hard to tell 'em apart today! And, say!\"<br>\n\"Sister is busy learning to shave,\"<br>\n\"Brother just loves his permanent wave,\"<br>\n\"It's hard to tell 'em apart today! Hey, hey!\"<br>\n\"Girls were girls and boys were boys when I was a tot,\"<br>\n\"Now we don't know who is who, or even what's what!\"<br>\n\"Knickers and trousers, baggy and wide,\"<br>\n\"Nobody knows who's walking inside,\"<br>\n\"Those masculine women and feminine men!\"\n\nThe relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the fact that the actor William Haines, regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the #1 male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with his partner, Jimmie Shields. Other popular gay actors/actresses of the decade included Alla Nazimova and Ramón Novarro. In 1927, Mae West wrote a play about homosexuality called \"The Drag\", and alluded to the work of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs. It was a box-office success. West regarded talking about sex as a basic human rights issue, and was also an early advocate of gay rights.\n\nProfound hostility did not abate in more remote areas such as western Canada. With the return of a conservative mood in the 1930s, the public grew intolerant of homosexuality, and gay actors were forced to choose between retiring or agreeing to hide their sexuality even in Hollywood.\n\nVienna psychiatrist Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) played a major role in Psychoanalysis, which impacted avant-garde thinking, especially in the humanities and artistic fields. Historian Roy Porter says:\n\nOther influential proponents of psychoanalysis included Alfred Adler (1870–1937), Karen Horney (1885–1952), and Helene Deutsch (1884–1982). Adler argued that a neurotic individual would overcompensate by manifesting aggression. Porter notes that Adler's views became part of \"an American commitment to social stability based on individual adjustment and adaptation to healthy, social forms.\"\n\nThe United States became more anti-immigration in policy. The Immigration Act of 1924 limited immigration to a fraction proportionate to that ethnic group in the United States in 1890. The goal was to freeze the pattern of European ethnic composition, and to exclude almost all Asians. Hispanics were not restricted.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand and Canada also sharply restricted or ended Asian immigration.\nIn Canada, the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 prevented almost all immigration from Asia. Other laws curbed immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries the Progressive movement gradually caused local communities in many parts of Western Europe and North America to tighten restrictions of vice activities, particularly gambling, alcohol, and narcotics (though splinters of this same movement were also involved in racial segregation in the U.S.). This movement gained its strongest traction in the U.S. and its crowning achievement was the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the associated Volstead Act which made illegal the manufacture, import and sale of beer, wine and hard liquor (though drinking was technically not illegal). The laws were specifically promoted by evangelical Protestant churches and the Anti-Saloon League to reduce drunkenness, petty crime, wife abuse, corrupt saloon-politics, and (in 1918), Germanic influences. The KKK was an active supporter in rural areas, but cities generally left enforcement to a small number of federal officials. The various restrictions on alcohol and gambling were widely unpopular leading to rampant and flagrant violations of the law, and consequently to a rapid rise of organized crime around the nation (as typified by Chicago's Al Capone). In Canada, prohibition ended much earlier than in the U.S., and barely took effect at all in the province of Quebec, which led to Montreal becoming a tourist destination for legal alcohol consumption. The continuation of legal alcohol production in Canada soon led to a new industry in smuggling liquor into the U.S.\n\nSpeakeasies were illegal bars selling beer and liquor after paying off local police and government officials. They became popular in major cities and helped fund large-scale gangsters operations such as those of Lucky Luciano, Al Capone, Meyer Lansky, Bugs Moran, Moe Dalitz, Joseph Ardizzone, and Sam Maceo. They operated with connections to organized crime and liquor smuggling. While the U.S. Federal Government agents raided such establishments and arrested many of the small figures and smugglers, they rarely managed to get the big bosses; the business of running speakeasies was so lucrative that such establishments continued to flourish throughout the nation. In major cities, speakeasies could often be elaborate, offering food, live bands, and floor shows. Police were notoriously bribed by speakeasy operators to either leave them alone or at least give them advance notice of any planned raid.\n\nThe Roaring Twenties was a period of literary creativity, and works of several notable authors appeared during the period. D. H. Lawrence's novel \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" was a scandal at the time because of its explicit descriptions of sex.\nBooks that take the 1920s as their subject include:\n\nCharles Lindbergh gained sudden great international fame as the first pilot to fly solo and non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean, flying from Roosevelt Airfield (Nassau County, Long Island), New York to Paris on May 20 – May 21, 1927. He had a single-engine airplane, the \"Spirit of St. Louis\", which had been designed by Donald Hall and custom built by Ryan Airlines of San Diego, California. His flight took 33.5 hours. The President of France bestowed on him the French Legion of Honor and, on his arrival back in the United States, a fleet of warships and aircraft escorted him to Washington, D.C., where President Calvin Coolidge awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nThe Roaring Twenties was the breakout decade for sports across the modern world. Citizens from all parts of the country flocked to see the top athletes of the day compete in arenas and stadia. Their exploits were loudly and highly praised in the new \"gee whiz\" style of sports journalism that was emerging; champions of this style of writing included the legendary writers Grantland Rice and Damon Runyon in the U.S. Sports literature presented a new form of heroism departing from the traditional models of masculinity.\n\nHigh school and junior high school students were offered to play sports that they hadn't been able to play in the past. Several sports, such as golf, that had previously been unavailable to the middle-class finally became available. Also, a notable motorsports feat was accomplished in Roaring Twenties as driver Henry Seagrave, driving his car the Golden Arrow, reaches at the time in 1929 a record speed of 231.44  mph.\n\nFollowing the 1922 Latin American Games in Rio de Janeiro, IOC officials toured the region, helping countries establish national Olympic committees and prepare for future competition. In some countries, such as Brazil, sporting and political rivalries hindered progress as opposing factions battled for control of the international sport. The 1924 Olympic Games in Paris and the 1928 games in Amsterdam saw greatly increased participation from Latin American athletes.\n\nSports journalism, modernity, and nationalism excited Egypt. Egyptians of all classes were captivated by news of the Egyptian national soccer team's performance in international competitions. Success or failure in the Olympics of 1924 and 1928 was more than a betting opportunity but became an index of Egyptian independence and a desire to be seen as modern by Europe. Egyptians also saw these competitions as a way to distinguish themselves from the traditionalism of the rest of Africa.\n\nThe Greek government of Eleftherios Venizelos initiated a number of programs involving physical education in the public schools and raised the profile of sports competition. Other Balkan nations also became more involved in sports and participated in several precursors of the Balkan Games, competing sometimes with Western European teams. The Balkan Games, first held in Athens in 1929 as an experiment, proved a sporting and a diplomatic success. From the beginning, the games, held in Greece through 1933, sought to improve relations among Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Albania. As a political and diplomatic event, the games worked in conjunction with an annual Balkan Conference, which resolved issues between these often-feuding nations. The results were quite successful; officials from all countries routinely praised the games' athletes and organizers. During a period of persistent and systematic efforts to create rapprochement and unity in the region, this series of athletic meetings played a key role.\n\nThe most popular American athlete of the 1920s was baseball player Babe Ruth. His characteristic home run hitting heralded a new epoch in the history of the sport (the \"Live-ball era\"), and his high style of living fascinated the nation and made him one of the highest-profile figures of the decade. Fans were enthralled in 1927 when Ruth hit 60 home runs, setting a new single-season home run record that was not broken until 1961. Together with another up-and-coming star named Lou Gehrig, Ruth laid the foundation of future New York Yankees dynasties.\n\nA former bar room brawler named Jack Dempsey aka Garrett won the world heavyweight boxing title and became the most celebrated pugilist of his time. Enrique Chaffardet the Venezuelan Featherweight World Champion was the most sought-after boxer in 1920s Brooklyn, New York. College football captivated fans, with notables such as Red Grange, running back of the University of Illinois, and Knute Rockne who coached Notre Dame's football program to great success on the field and nationwide notoriety. Grange also played a role in the development of professional football in the mid-1920s by signing on with the NFL's Chicago Bears. Bill Tilden thoroughly dominated his competition in tennis, cementing his reputation as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. And Bobby Jones popularized golf with his spectacular successes on the links; the game did not see another major star of his stature come along until Arnold Palmer and then Jack Nicklaus in the early 1960s. Ruth, Dempsey, Grange, Tilden, and Jones are collectively referred to as the \"Big Five\" sporting icons of the Roaring Twenties.\n\nDuring the 19th century vices such as gambling, alcohol, and narcotics had been popular throughout the United States in spite of not always being technically legal. Enforcement against these vices had always been spotty. Indeed, most major cities established red-light districts to regulate gambling and prostitution despite the fact that these vices were typically illegal. However, with the rise of the Progressive Movement in the early 20th century, laws gradually became tighter with most gambling, alcohol, and narcotics outlawed by the 1920s. Because of widespread public opposition to these prohibitions, especially alcohol, a great economic opportunity was created for criminal enterprises. Organized crime blossomed during this era, particularly the American Mafia. So lucrative were these vices that some entire cities in the U.S. became illegal gaming centers with vice actually supported by the local governments. Notable examples include Miami, Florida and Galveston, Texas.\n\nMany of these criminal enterprises would long outlast the roaring twenties and ultimately were instrumental in establishing Las Vegas as a gaming center.\n\nWeimar culture was the flourishing of the arts and sciences that flourished in Germany during the Weimar Republic, from 1918 until Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933. 1920s Berlin was at the hectic center of the Weimar culture. Although not part of Germany, German-speaking Austria, and particularly Vienna, is often included as part of Weimar culture. Bauhaus was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts. Its goal of unifying art, craft, and technology became influential worldwide, especially in architecture.\n\nGermany, and Berlin in particular, was fertile ground for intellectuals, artists, and innovators from many fields. The social environment was chaotic, and politics were passionate. German university faculties became universally open to Jewish scholars in 1918. Leading Jewish intellectuals on university faculties included physicist Albert Einstein; sociologists Karl Mannheim, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse; philosophers Ernst Cassirer and Edmund Husserl; sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld; political theorists Arthur Rosenberg and Gustav Meyer; and many others. Nine German citizens were awarded Nobel prizes during the Weimar Republic, five of whom were Jewish scientists, including two in medicine.\n\nSport took on a new importance as the human body became a focus that pointed away from the heated rhetoric of standard politics. The new emphasis reflected the search for freedom by young Germans alienated from rationalized work routines.\n\nThe 1920s saw dramatic innovations in American political campaign techniques, based especially on new advertising methods that had worked so well selling war bonds during the First World War. Governor James M. Cox of Ohio, the Democratic Party candidate, made a whirlwind campaign that took him to rallies, train station speeches, and formal addresses, reaching audiences totaling perhaps 2,000,000 people. It resembled the William Jennings Bryan campaign of 1896. By contrast, the Republican Party candidate Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio relied upon a \"Front Porch Campaign.\" It brought 600,000 voters to Marion, Ohio, where Harding spoke from his home. Republican campaign manager Will Hays spent some $8,100,000; nearly four times the money Cox's campaign spent. Hays used national advertising in a major way (with advice from adman Albert Lasker). The theme was Harding's own slogan \"America First.\" Thus the Republican advertisement in \"Collier's Magazine\" for October 30, 1920, demanded, \"Let's be done with wiggle and wobble.\" The image presented in the ads was nationalistic, using catchphrases like \"absolute control of the United States by the United States,\" \"Independence means independence, now as in 1776,\" \"This country will remain American. Its next President will remain in our own country,\" and \"We decided long ago that we objected to a foreign government of our people.\"\n\n1920 was the first presidential campaign to be heavily covered by the press and to receive widespread newsreel coverage, and it was also the first modern campaign to use the power of Hollywood and Broadway stars who traveled to Marion for photo opportunities with Harding and his wife. Al Jolson, Lillian Russell, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, were among the celebrities to make the pilgrimage. Business icons Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone also lent their cachet to the Front Porch Campaign. On election night, November 2, 1920, commercial radio broadcast coverage of election returns for the first time. Announcers at KDKA-AM in Pittsburgh, PA read telegraph ticker results over the air as they came in. This single station could be heard over most of the Eastern United States by the small percentage of the population that had radio receivers.\n\nCalvin Coolidge was inaugurated as President after the sudden death of President Warren G. Harding in 1923; he was re-elected in 1924 in a landslide against a divided opposition. Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president: his inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio; on 12 February 1924, he became the first American president to deliver a political speech on radio. Herbert Hoover was elected President in 1928.\n\nUnions grew very rapidly during the war but after a series of failed major strikes in steel, meatpacking and other industries, a long decade of decline weakened most unions and membership fell even as employment grew rapidly. Radical unionism virtually collapsed, in large part because of Federal repression during World War I by means of the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918. The major unions supported the third party candidacy of Robert La Follette in 1924.\n\nThe 1920s marked a period of sharp decline for the labor movement. Union membership and activities fell sharply in the face of economic prosperity, a lack of leadership within the movement, and anti-union sentiments from both employers and the government. The unions were much less able to organize strikes. In 1919, more than 4,000,000 workers (or 21% of the labor force) participated in about 3,600 strikes. In contrast, 1929 witnessed about 289,000 workers (or 1.2% of the workforce) stage only 900 strikes. Unemployment rarely dipped below 5% in the 1920s and few workers faced real wage losses.\n\nThe Progressive Era in the United States was a period of social activism and political reform that flourished from the 1890s to the 1920s. The politics of the 1920s was unfriendly toward the labor unions and liberal crusaders against business, so many if not all historians who emphasize those themes write off the decade. Urban cosmopolitan scholars recoiled at the moralism of prohibition and the intolerance of the nativists of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), and denounced the era. Historian Richard Hofstadter, for example, in 1955 wrote that prohibition, \"was a pseudo-reform, a pinched, parochial substitute for reform\" that \"was carried about America by the rural-evangelical virus\". However, as Arthur S. Link emphasized, the progressives did not simply roll over and play dead. Link's argument for continuity through the 1920s stimulated a historiography that found Progressivism to be a potent force. Palmer, pointing to people like George Norris, say, \"It is worth noting that progressivism, whilst temporarily losing the political initiative, remained popular in many western states and made its presence felt in Washington during both the Harding and Coolidge presidencies.\" Gerster and Cords argue that \"Since progressivism was a 'spirit' or an 'enthusiasm' rather than an easily definable force with common goals, it seems more accurate to argue that it produced a climate for reform which lasted well into the 1920s, if not beyond.\" Even the Klan has been seen in a new light, as numerous social historians reported that Klansmen were \"ordinary white Protestants\" primarily interested in purification of the system, which had long been a core progressive goal.\n\nWhat historians have identified as \"business progressivism\", with its emphasis on efficiency and typified by Henry Ford and Herbert Hoover reached an apogee in the 1920s. Wik, for example, argues that Ford's \"views on technology and the mechanization of rural America were generally enlightened, progressive, and often far ahead of his times.\"\n\nTindall stresses the continuing importance of the Progressive movement in the South in the 1920s involving increased democracy, efficient government, corporate regulation, social justice, and governmental public service. William Link finds political progressivism dominant in most of the South in the 1920s. Likewise it was influential in Midwest.\n\nHistorians of women and of youth emphasize the strength of the progressive impulse in the 1920s. Women consolidated their gains after the success of the suffrage movement, and moved into causes such as world peace, good government, maternal care (the Sheppard–Towner Act of 1921), and local support for education and public health. The work was not nearly as dramatic as the suffrage crusade, but women voted and operated quietly and effectively. Paul Fass, speaking of youth, says \"Progressivism as an angle of vision, as an optimistic approach to social problems, was very much alive.\" The international influences which had sparked a great many reform ideas likewise continued into the 1920s, as American ideas of modernity began to influence Europe.\n\nThere is general agreement that the Progressive era was over by 1932, especially since a majority of the remaining progressives opposed the New Deal.\n\nCanadian politics were dominated federally by the Liberal Party of Canada under William Lyon Mackenzie King. The federal government spent most of the decade disengaged from the economy and focused on paying off the large debts amassed during the war and during the era of railway over expansion. After the booming wheat economy of the early part of the century, the prairie provinces were troubled by low wheat prices. This played an important role in the development of Canada's first highly successful third party, the Progressive Party of Canada that won the second most seats in the 1921 national election. As well with the creation of the Balfour Declaration of 1926 Canada achieved with other British former colonies autonomy; creating the British Commonwealth.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Stock Index had continued its upward move for weeks, and coupled with heightened speculative activities, it gave an illusion that the bull market of 1928 to 1929 would last forever. On October 29, 1929, also known as Black Tuesday, stock prices on Wall Street collapsed. The events in the United States added to a worldwide depression, later called the Great Depression, that put millions of people out of work across the world throughout the 1930s.\n\nThe 21st Amendment, which repealed the 18th Amendment, was proposed on February 20, 1933. The choice to legalize alcohol was left up to the states, and many states quickly took this opportunity to allow alcohol. Prohibition was officially ended with the ratification of the Amendment on December 5, 1933.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This project aims at scanning Old Kingdom Egyptian Pyramids (Khufu, Khafre, the Bent and the Red) to detect the presence of unknown internal voids and structures.\n\nThe project, launched on October 2015, combines several non-invasive and non-destructive techniques which may help to a better understanding of their structure and their construction processes and techniques. The team is currently using Infrared thermography, muon tomography, 3D simulation and reconstruction techniques.\n\nScanPyramids is an interdisciplinary project mixing art, science and technology. On November 2, 2017, the ScanPyramids team announced, through a publication in Nature, its third discovery in the Great Pyramid, a \"plane-sized\" previously unknown void named the \"ScanPyramids Big Void\".\n\nOn October 15, 2016 ScanPyramids confirmed their first unknown void discoveries thanks to muon tomography in the Great Pyramid. A previously unknown cavity was confirmed on the North-Eastern Edge, roughly at 110m high with similar void volume characteristics as a known \"cave\" located at 83m on the same edge.\n\nA second void was discovered behind the chevrons area of Khufu's North Face above the descending corridor. This area was investigated after thermal anomalies observation that led the team to position muon emulsion plates in the descending corridor. This void has been more investigated during the year 2017 in order to provide more information about its shape, size, and exact position.\n\nDuring 2017 more muons emulsion plates were positioned in the descending corridor and in Al-Mamun's tunnel. The void behind the chevrons has been reconfirmed through different \"point of views\" and its characteristics have been refined. Named \"ScanPyramids North-Face Corridor\", this void is located between 17 and 23m from the Great Pyramid's ground level, between 0,7m and 2m from the North Face. Its slope is either horizontal or upward slope and it has a corridor like shape.\n\nOn November 2, 2017, the ScanPyramids team published in the scientific peer-reviewed journal Nature its third discovery, named \"ScanPyramids Big Void\". This previously unknown and gigantic void is located just above the known Grand Gallery, in a circumscribed area. Its minimum length is 30m and it has a similar cross-section as the Grand Gallery. The ScanPyramids Big Void has been observed by three teams of physicists from different points of view (2 points of view in the Queen's Chamber and from outside in front of the North Face). Each team has confirmed the discovery of this previously unknown void at certainty level above 5 Sigma.\n\nThe three scientific institution specialized in particle physics have worked independently and each one used a different and complementary muography technique:\n\n\nThe team has been very cautious about its architectural nature. As it was done for the void discovered behind the chevrons area (ScanPyramids North Face Corridor), new muography observations, from new angles, should be conducted in order to refine the Big Void's architectural characteristics (slope, shape).\n\nThis discovery has been featured in many international media as one of the top discoveries of the year 2017 (NBC News, Euronews, Physics World, Science News, Global News, Gizmodo, Business Insider, Altmetric, Egypt Today, NBC, MSN News, Le Monde, CTV, The Franklin Institute, Radio Canada, Sciences et Avenir, RTE, PBS, Yahoo, La Vanguardia, France Info).\n\nOn November 2, 2017, the Egyptologist Zahi Hawass, who published few weeks before, with Mark Lehner his latest book, \"Giza and the Pyramids: A definitive history\", told the New York Times: “They found nothing...This paper offers nothing to Egyptology. Zero.”\n\nOn November 4, Khaled al-Anany, Egyptian Minister of Antiquities said, during a press conference, that the void space found inside the Great Pyramid of Khufu by the ScanPyramids project is a new revelation that brought the world’s attention to Egypt. He added “What was discovered is new and larger than the known cavities, and we’ll continue in our scientific steps”.\n\nOther Egyptologists have welcomed the discovery. Yukinori Kawae told National Geographic “This is definitely the discovery of the century...There have been many hypotheses about the pyramid, but no one even imagined that such a big void is located above the Grand Gallery.”\n\nPeter der Manuelian from Harvard University said that “This is an exciting new discovery, and potentially a major contribution to our knowledge about the Great Pyramid.”\n\nLee Thompson, an expert in particle physics at the University of Sheffield (UK) told Science: \"The scientists have “seen” the void using three different muon detectors in three independent experiments, which makes their finding very robust.\" Christopher Morris, physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory called the findings “pretty amazing.” Jerry Anderson who worked on Khafre's Pyramid and was a member of the team of Luis Walter Alvarez, the first scientist to use muography inside a pyramid in the 1965, said to Los Angeles Time, with a laugh: \"I am very excited and very pleased...I wish we had worked in the Great Pyramid, now that I look back on it”.\n"}

{"id": "33318990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33318990", "title": "Text and conversation theory", "text": "Text and conversation theory\n\nText and conversation is a theory in the field of organizational communication illustrating how communication makes up an organization. In the theory's simplest explanation, an organization is created and defined by communication. Communication \"is\" the organization and the organization exists because communication takes place. The theory is built on the notion, an organization is not seen as a physical unit holding communication. Text and conversation theory puts communication processes at the heart of organizational communication and postulates, an organization doesn't contain communication as a \"causal influence\", but is formed by the communication within. This theory is not intended for direct application, but rather to explain how communication exists. The theory provides a framework for better understanding organizational communication.\n\nSince the foundation of organizations are in communication, an organization cannot exist without communication, and the organization is defined as the result of communications happening within its context. Communications begin with individuals within the organization discussing beliefs, goals, structures, plans and relationships. These communicators achieve this through constant development, delivery, and translation of \"text and conversation\". The theory proposes mechanisms of communications are \"text and \"conversation\".\n\nThe foundation of this theory is the concepts of text and conversation. Text is defined as the content of interaction, or what is said in an interaction. Text is the meaning made available to individuals through a face-to-face or electronic mode of communication. Conversation is defined as what is happening behaviorally between two or more participants in the communication process. Conversation is the exchange or interaction itself.\n\nThe process of the text and conversation exchange is reciprocal: text needs conversation and vice versa for the process of communication to occur. Text, or content, must have context to be effective and a conversation, or discourse, needs to have a beginning, middle and end. Individuals create the beginning, middle and end by using punctuation, bracketing or framing. When conversation is coupled with text, or meaning, communication occurs. Taylor submits this process is a translation process of: translation of text to conversation and the translation of conversation into text.\nJames R. Taylor, introduced text and conversation theory in 1996 with François Cooren, Giroux and Robichaud and then further explored the theory in 1999. Taylor drew on the work of sociologist and educator John Dewey’s pragmatic view society exists not \"by\" but \"in\" communication. Taylor followed the same principle, putting communication as the essence of an organization.\nHe was born in 1928 and is Professor Emeritus at the Department of Communication of the Université de Montréal, which he founded in the early 1970s. Drawing from research in fields of organizational psychology (Karl E. Weick), ethnomethodology (Harold Garfinkel), Deirdre Boden), phenomenology (Alfred Schütz) and collective minding (Edwin Hutchins), Taylor formed the original text and conversation theory. This line of thought has come to be known as \"The Montreal School\" of organizational communication, sometimes referred to as TMS, and has been acknowledged as an original theory by authors such as Haridimos Tsoukas, Linda Putman, and Karl E. Weick.\n\n\"Structuration theory\" identifies how text and conversation theory evolved from this communication construct. Proposed by Anthony Giddens (1984) in ‘’The Constitution on Society,’’ structuration theory, originated in the discipline of sociology. Giddens’ theory has been adapted to the field of communication, particularly organizational communication; specifically, how and why structural changes are possible and the duality of formal and informal communication.\nThis theory is based on concepts of structure and agency. structure is defined as rules and resources of an organization; agency is the free will to choose to do otherwise than prescribed through structure.\nStructuration theory identifies structure and agency as coexisting. Formal rules and resources impact informal communication and discourse. This duality and coexistence ensures a cyclical nature between structure and agency, which has a cause and effect: new structure and agency is created from the causal relationships of previous structure and agency decisions. The concept to understanding structuration is to understand to duality of structure The similarity of Giddens’ theory and conversation and text theory is a mutual-existing and causal relationship of communication. The main difference, between the two, is structuration theory explains how communication impacts the organization, text and conversation, by means of structure and agency. Giddens' construct of structuration explains how mutually causal relationships constitute the essence of an organization. This concept illustrates how communication within an organization depends on the translation of meaning.\n\n\"Conversation theory\", proposed by Gordon Pask in the 1970s, identifies a framework to explain how scientific theory and interactions formulate the \"construction of knowledge\"\nConversation Theory is based on the idea social systems are symbolic and language-oriented. Additionally, these systems are based on responses and interpretations, and the meaning interpreted by individuals via communication\nThis theory is based on interaction between two or more individuals, with unlike perspectives The significance of having unlike perspectives is that it enables a distinctive standpoint: it permits the ability to study how people identify differences and understand meaning. Additionally, these differences create shared and consensual pockets of interactions and communications as discussed in Structure-Organization-Process.\nAnother idea of conversation theory is learning happens by exchanges about issues, which assists in making knowledge explicit. In order for this to happen, Pask organized three levels of conversation, according to:\nAdditionally, to facilitate learning, Pask proposed two types of learning strategies.\nUltimately, Pask found versatile learners neither favor one approach over the other. Rather, they understand how both approaches are integrated into the structure of learning. The similarities of conversation theory and text and conversation theory are they both focus on the foundational aspects of meaning. Specifically, how and why meaning is established and interpreted amongst individuals. However, the difference between the two theories is conversation theory specifically focuses on the dynamics of two people. Text and conversation theory is typically applied to at least two people. Conversation theory emphasizes the construct of knowledge of meaning and the cause and effect relationship that occurs as a result of self-learning from communication, based on meaning.\n\n\"Meaning management\" is the control of \"context\" and \"message\" to accomplish a desired communication effect. According to Fairhurst, leaders are change agents Leaders define the value of the organization and shape communication by implementing unique organizational communication approaches. Within an organization, leaders and managers establish the framework for communication, which helps to manage meaning. \"Leaders\" provide information to followers, such as the organizations’ mission, vision, values, as well as its collective identity Contrary to leaders, \"managers\" are responsible for day to day problem solving. Their core framing tasks are solving problems and stimulating others to find solutions.\n\nIndividuals, regardless of positional authority, can manage meaning. Meaning management is to communicate with a specific goal by controlling the context and message Individuals utilizing meaning management are communicating and shaping the meaning by using the power of framing.\n\n\"Culture\" is a unique set of behaviors, including language, belief and customs learnt from being raised in social groups or by joining a particular group throughout time. Culture defines context and is the social totality that defines behavior, knowledge, beliefs and social learning. It is a set of shared values characterizing a specific organization. Fairhurst identifies culture as defining events, people, objects, and concepts. Communication and culture are intertwined. Shared language of a group links together individuals and joins common cultures. Culture influences mental models. \"Mental models\" are the images in your mind about other people, yourself, substance and events.\n\nAdditionally, culture defines social interactions and how individuals and groups interpret and apply context. Organizations with good communication foundation are able to interpret and differentiate individuals’ cultural discourses, as well as creatively combine and constrain these discourses. Ir defines the ideological basis for people and lays the foundation for how they frame and can be observed and described, but not controlled. It is defined by the group or individual accepting the specific patterns of behavior, knowledge, or beliefs Individuals can shape culture and make changes over time, as long as they are clear about specific attitudes and behaviors that are desired As Weick and Sutcliffe (2007) discussed, culture can be changed through symbols, values, and content — organizations shape culture. An organizational culture emerges from a set of expectations that matter to people, from things like [inclusion, exclusion, praise, positive feelings, social support, isolation, care, indifference, excitement and anger Individuals are shaped by an organization's culture. However, an organization has its own culture. According to Martin (1985), within that organizational culture, three forms of culture can result: integration, differentiation and fragmentation.\nWith Integration, all organizational members consistently share values and assumptions about work. As a result the members of the organization share uniquely organizational experiences and thus, a unique culture\nIf differentiation occurs, cultures are not unitary. Sub-groups consistently share values and assumptions about work. Members tend to operate in different areas, different projects and at different levels of the hierarchy.\nCultures are often ambiguous if fragmentation happens. Individuals are interconnected with some members and disconnected with others. This creates inconsistently shared values and assumptions about the organization As a result friendship/romantic as well as enemy/competitor type relationships are cut across an organization’s sub-groups.\n\nIndividuals who understand the structure and inner working of their organizations can leverage knowledge toward achieving communication goals. Likewise, organizations can also leverage their hierarchical structures to achieve targeted outcomes.\nTwo types of structures exist within an organization.\nGoldsmith and Katzenback (2008) explained organizations must understand the informal organization. For example, of being a part of an informal or formal structure, it is important for managers to learn to recognize signs of trouble in order to shape context as they attempt to coordinate meaning and solve day-to-day problems. Specific implications for organizational learning include enhanced performance, coordinated activity and structure, division of labor and collective goal setting \nWhile a formal organization is visually represented by a typical hierarchical structure, it visually shows how formal responsibilities are spread, as well as job dispersal and the flow of information In contrast, the informal organization embodies how people network to accomplish the job, via social relationships and connections or subject-matter experts that are not represented on the organizational chart By leveraging this informal organization, people within the organization are able to use their social network to access and shape the decision-making processes quicker, as well as establish cross-structural collaboration amongst themselves.\nAdditionally, by understanding and using both structures, leaders and managers are able to learn more about their people. Interpreting all forms of communication, verbal and visual, whether you are a supervisor or a subordinate is invaluable. The hierarchical and network structures can allow an organization to recognize signs of trouble from people, accomplish core framing tasks, and to be able to communicate with mindfulness and meaning. By unlocking the value of an organization's structure, leaders and managers can use this knowledge to boost performance or achieve specific goals. Signs of trouble can be emotional, hidden, physical, or in plain sight.\n\nKnowing individuals’ personalities, conflict tendencies, as well as their unique circumstances help an organization to understand its mental models and cultural discourse. Additionally, by noticing abnormalities and not being blind to details, an organization should be able to recognize signs of trouble within day-to-day operations and management, whether it is fraud, lack of maintenance standards, sexual harassment, or even a poor framework for communication.\nUnderstanding and the ability to recognize signs of trouble empower managers to employ the rules of reality construction: control the context, define the situation, apply ethics, interpret uncertainty, and design the response, which leads to communicating by a structured way of thinking.\n\nUltimately, by understanding how an organization works, you enhance communication collectively. Additionally, by knowing how employees and relationships are shaped and the context that defines how each person interacts with one another, you can shape contagious emotions.\nBasic building blocks of Taylor’s theories is the relationship of text and conversation, and how that relationship requires a \"two-step translational process\"\nFollowing this translational process, text and conversation is transferred to organizational communication. If context, or text, defines the organization then ongoing introductions and meaning are crucial to define what is meant by the term organization.\nTo examine this further, Taylor defined \"six degrees of separation\" to understand organizational communication:\n\nThis theory uses interactions of text and conversation to construct networks of relationships. By doing so, the theory enables a deep understanding of personal communication within an organization. Additionally, it explains how that communication ends up actually defining the organization, rather than the individuals within the organization. Taylor’s theory places more importance on personal communication, rather than individuals. The practical application, as a result, is communication behaviors can constitute how and what we think of an organization. Additionally, by manipulating communication processes, not only could structure be altered, but the entire organization could be changed as well whether change is beneficial or negative, is based on desired meaning, or context and message, people within the organization want to exchange and translate.\n\nTaylor stresses the importance and impact of dialogue, specifically relating to how people interact with one another and interpret context. Taylor explains in Heath et al. (2006) that virtuous reasoning embodies entire discussions. Additionally, he points out dialogue should not prevent issues that arise from debate Since 1993, Taylor’s theory has been the focus of more than six organizational communication books. Additionally, Taylor’s ideas are referred to as \"The Montreal School\" of organizational communication Within the field of communication, TMS has been recognized for its contributions to organizational communication as well as related disciplines. Books focusing on text and conversation theory have sold internationally One to the largest and simplest contributions this theory provided the communication academic field was the ability to describe and characterize and organization. From this, people could better understand and fully construct and organization’s identity.\n\nAccording to Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), organizational learning is the study of how collectives adapt to, or fail to adapt to, their environments. It utilizes tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge.\nUltimately, organizational learning achieves enhanced performance, coordinated activity and structure, and achievement of collective goals by externalization and internalization.\nText and conversation theory places significant challenges and burdens on the organization to articulate knowledge. Whether knowledge is passed directly by individuals, up and down or horizontally on the formal or informal organizational structure, there is no guarantee text has proper context to be effective as conversation. Additionally, conversation codes are influenced by how the organization ensures knowledge carriers pass information and communicate with purpose, message, and meaning.\nHow information is passed can be unclear, and consistently has to adapt to new challenges. Some of these challenges, or factors, include how individuals and an organization adapt to meaning, culture, structure, and knowledge, in order to communicate.\nUltimately, within the organization itself, people are impacted by bias’ on group and individual levels.\n\n\"Problems with Group Learning\"\n\"Problems with Individual Learning\"\n\n\n"}

It is the fifth episode of the fifth season, and it first aired on October 14, 1993.\n\nJerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer go to the hospital to meet friends who have just had a baby. At the hospital, George gets a parking spot right in front of the hospital. A mental patient jumps from the roof and lands on it. George attempts to get the hospital to pay for the car's damages, but the director refuses, insinuating that George is running a scam. Kramer stumbles into the wrong room at the hospital (1937 instead of 1397) and becomes convinced that he has seen a \"pigman\" (half-pig, half-man). He espouses a conspiracy theory concerning the government and genetic mutation leading to pigmen armies.\n\nJerry and Elaine agree to become godparents to the newborn baby. Jerry uses the role as a prompt to perform impersonations of Marlon Brando's character from \"The Godfather\", but his friends are severely unimpressed. They are obligated to arrange the bris, which involves booking a mohel and holding the baby during the circumcision. Kramer, disturbed by the concept of the bris, upsets the mother with grotesque descriptions of circumcision and seizes the baby in an unsuccessful rescue attempt. The mohel (Charles Levin) is extremely irritable and high-strung, and implies that he was charged with malpractice due to a botched circumcision on at least one previous occasion. Made increasingly nervous by this, Jerry flinches as the circumcision gets under way, and the mohel cuts off Jerry's finger. The four go to the hospital, where the baby's parents have to break up a fight between Jerry and the mohel. Jerry's finger is stitched up. Kramer finds the \"pigman\" (whom he later discovers is actually \"a fat little mental patient\") and \"liberates\" him from the hospital. The \"pigman\" steals George's car, which was again conveniently parked.\n\nThe parents strip Jerry and Elaine of their role as godparents, deciding they prefer Kramer due to the concern he expressed for the baby. Pleased, Kramer performs an off-the-cuff impersonation of \"The Godfather\" which far eclipses Jerry's.\n\nJason Alexander, who plays the part of George Costanza, has described the character of the mohel as \"disgusting\" and \"anti-Semitic in a hurtful way\". After having read the first draft of the script, Alexander approached co-creator and executive producer Larry David and asked to be written out of the episode. When David said he would \"soften\" the character before they filmed the episode, Alexander agreed to stay in. However, he still has regrets about how the mohel was portrayed.\n\n"}
{"id": "35242710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35242710", "title": "The Journal of Sir Walter Scott", "text": "The Journal of Sir Walter Scott\n\nThe Journal of Sir Walter Scott is a diary which the novelist and poet Walter Scott kept between 1825 and 1832. It records the financial disaster which overtook him at the beginning of 1826, and the efforts he made over the next seven years to pay off his debts by writing bestselling books. Since its first complete publication in 1890 it has attracted high praise, being considered by many critics one of the finest diaries in the language.\n\nThe manuscript of the \"Journal\", \"a handsome lockd volume\" as Scott called it, is of quarto size and bound in vellum. The handwriting displayed in it, especially after his final series of strokes, is so atrociously difficult that, according to the \"Journal\"'s most recent editor, a perfectly accurate transcription is quite impossible. The title-page bears this inscription:\n\nThe manuscript was kept at Abbotsford after Scott's death, but was bought by the financier J. P. Morgan around 1900, and is now in the Morgan Library in New York.\n\nIn July 1825 Scott acquired a copy of the \"Diary of Samuel Pepys\", which had just been published for the first time, and according to his son-in-law J. G. Lockhart, \"I never observed him more delighted with any book whatsoever\". Later that year he read a manuscript copy of Byron's 1821 journal and was impressed by Byron's plan of writing a desultory, unsystematic record of his actions, thoughts and memories, which combined the maximum of interest for the reader with the minimum of effort for the writer. Inspired by these two models, he opened his own new diary on November 20, 1825 and wrote the first entry. Only two days later he noted doubts as to the financial stability of the publisher Archibald Constable & Co., which concerned him greatly since he had a large stake in the firm. His worst fears were realized the following year when Constable failed, bringing James Ballantyne & Co., in which Scott was a partner, down with him. Scott found himself personally liable for debts totalling more than £125,000. He resolved to pay off the debts by his own labours as a novelist rather than accept bankruptcy, and the \"Journal\" records his unceasing efforts to do this as he writes a series of novels and histories, including \"Woodstock\", \"The Surgeon's Daughter\", \"The Fair Maid of Perth\", \"Anne of Geierstein\", \"Count Robert of Paris\", \"The Siege of Malta\", \"Bizarro\", \"The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte\" and \"Tales of a Grandfather\". Other disasters are recorded in the \"Journal\", such as the death of his wife in 1826, and a series of strokes which increasingly undermined his physical and mental powers. In July 1828 he allowed the habit of keeping his journal to lapse for several months, but returned to the task from January 1829 to July 1829 and from May 1830 to May 1831. In October 1831 he again resumed the \"Journal\", having been offered £1000 or £1500 by his publisher Robert Cadell for some record of his forthcoming voyage to Malta and Italy. He finally abandoned work on it in Naples in April 1832, the last entry ending in the middle of a sentence.\n\nFrom the time of the \"Journal\"’s first publication extraordinary claims have been made for it. In 1891 Algernon Swinburne wrote that \"The too long delayed publication of his \"Journal\" is in every way an almost priceless benefit; but as a final illustration and attestation of a character almost incomparably lovable, admirable, and noble, it is a gift altogether beyond price.\" The biographer Hesketh Pearson called it \"Perhaps the most valuable, certainly the most moving, of all his productions; and, since it displays a man whose goodness of heart balanced his greatness of mind, incomparably the most interesting work of its kind ever written.\" For Virginia Woolf, \"Scott's Journals are the best life of Scott in existence...they contain Scott in his glory and Scott in his gloom...in a few passages Scott throws more light upon his genius and its limitations than all his critics in their innumerable volumes\". The Scott scholar David Hewitt agreed, writing that \"There is no greater or more moving diary in English\"; however he also made the point that its fine artistic shape cannot be credited to Scott, since he quite fortuitously took up the \"Journal\" as the tragedy of his last years was about to begin. The literary historian Oliver Elton believed that the \"Journal\"’s high place in English literature was secure: \"Whatever else of Scott's may lose its colour with time, the \"Journal\" cannot do so, with its accurate, unexaggerated language of pain.\"\n\nLockhart believed that Scott knew his \"Journal\" would eventually be published, but he nevertheless called it \"The most candid Diary that ever man penned\". The theme of the \"Journal\"'s candour has been taken up by many later critics. C. S. Lewis considered that it was \"One of the sincerest books in the world, and (what is not exactly the same thing) full of self-knowledge.\" The novelist John Buchan wrote that \"It is one of the most complete expressions of a human soul that we possess… There is no reticence and no posturing, because he is speaking to his own soul…The greatest figure he ever drew is in the \"Journal\", and it is the man Walter Scott.\" W. E. K. Anderson added the other side of the coin: \"It is candid about Scott himself. It is neither informative nor candid about other people.\" The novelist and critic A. N. Wilson judged it to be a truthful record of an unusual kind:There is nothing in it which can be contradicted by other biographical evidence…Yet there is something extremely \"conscious\" about it. It is far more than a work of art. Scott was not making himself out to be someone that he was not; rather, the Journal is his record of how he made himself conform to the heroic standards of his own fictions…Scott was intent on facing [his difficulties and sorrows] with the bravado of Burley and the stubbornness of Jeanie Deans.\nJohn Sutherland offered a dissenting view of the \"Journal\"'s sincerity. He thought that Scott, foreseeing eventual publication, took the opportunity to influence history's view of his financial crisis: \"In these appallingly humiliating circumstances it evidently became more important than ever that he should preserve a noble image of himself \"in extremis\" for posterity.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1864379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864379", "title": "The Onion Field", "text": "The Onion Field\n\nThe Onion Field is a 1973 nonfiction book by Joseph Wambaugh, a sergeant for the Los Angeles Police Department, chronicling the kidnapping of two plainclothes LAPD officers by a pair of criminals during a traffic stop and the subsequent murder of one of the officers.\n\nOn the night of March 9, 1963, LAPD officers Ian Campbell (age 31) and Karl Hettinger (age 28), both former Marines, were riding in an unmarked \"felony\" car. They pulled over a 1946 Ford coupe containing two suspicious-looking men at the corner of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in Hollywood. The two men, Gregory Ulas Powell (age 30) and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a. \"Jimmy Youngblood\", age 32), had recently committed a string of robberies, and \"each had a pistol tucked into his trousers.\" Powell, the driver, pulled a gun on Campbell, who \"calmly told his partner, 'He has a gun in my back. Give him your gun.'\" The two officers were then forced into Powell's car and, within 30 seconds after the traffic stop began, were driven north from Los Angeles on Route 99, to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Campbell was fatally shot. Hettinger was able to escape, running nearly four miles to reach a farmhouse.\n\nThe killing occurred primarily because Powell assumed that the kidnapping of the officers alone already constituted a capital crime under the state's Little Lindbergh Law. However, Powell's interpretation was incorrect. Under the Little Lindbergh Law kidnapping became a capital crime only if the victim were harmed or if a ransom were demanded. (Today, kidnapping in California, where there is bodily harm short of death, is punishable either by imprisonment for 25 years to life, or by life imprisonment without the possibility of parole).\n\nIn April 1982, following the release from prison of Powell's accomplice, Jimmy Lee Smith, Valerie Campbell, daughter of the slain Officer Ian Campbell, contacted John Mancino, founder of Citizens for Truth, an organization that had recently led a successful petition effort to rescind the parole date of convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, killer of presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nMancino drafted a petition to have Powell's scheduled release rescinded and with Valerie Campbell's help collected 31,500 signatures in three-and-a-half weeks, which were submitted to the California Board of Prison Terms, along with several thousand letters. The parole board then held a hearing and eventually rescinded Powell's release date.\n\nFollowing this, Powell's attorney was successful in convincing Solano County Superior Court Judge, Ellis Randall, to order Powell's release from prison in ten days, ruling that Citizens for Truth's public outcry was the sole reason Powell's release was rescinded, which at the time was legally improper. Valerie Campbell then joined Citizens for Truth's representatives, John Mancino and Dr. Howard Garber, along with the group's attorneys, in filing a legal brief in the First District Court of Appeals in San Francisco, demanding that Powell remain in prison.\n\nThe group prevailed both at the appeals court and the California Supreme Court, thereby leading to Powell's spending the rest of his life in prison, where he died in 2012.\n\nOn August 10, 2012, the intersection of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in Hollywood, the site of the officers' abduction, was named \"Ian Campbell Square\" in honor of the slain officer. Additionally, a section of the Hollywood Freeway (California State Route 101) in Hollywood, from Hollywood Boulevard to Highland Avenue, was designated the \"Ian J. Campbell Memorial Freeway.\"\n\nThough Hettinger was able to escape, he felt scorned by his fellow officers and officials at the Los Angeles Police Department and suffered severe emotional trauma for both the initial incident and the following treatment. Eventually a police training video was made using his experience as an example of what to do when stopping and approaching a vehicle.\n\nHettinger was forced to resign from the LAPD in 1966, after being accused of shoplifting. Years later, Hettinger was elected to serve as a Supervisor for Kern County, California, where he served multiple consecutive terms. He died of liver disease in 1994, at the age of 59.\n\nPowell was arrested on the night of the murder, after being spotted driving a stolen vehicle by California Highway Patrol officers. The following day, Smith was apprehended as well. The lead LAPD investigator on the case was Sergeant Pierce Brooks. Both suspects were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Ultimately, they received life sentences. For each, the lower court sentence followed a second trial and several appeals. Their death sentences were vacated when the California Supreme Court ruled in \"California v. Anderson\" (1972) that California's death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAt a parole board hearing on January 27, 2010, Powell was denied parole. In a January 21, 2010 letter to state corrections officials, Los Angeles Police Union President Paul Weber urged the board to deny parole, calling Powell a \"vicious murderer who has not yet paid his debt to society\".\n\nOn October 18, 2011, the California State Parole Board denied compassionate release for Powell, who had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. The board stated that Powell did not wish to be released from prison and was likely to be uncooperative if paroled.\nPowell died on August 12, 2012, at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville. He was 79 years old.\n\nSmith was initially released in 1982 but returned to prison several additional times on drug-related parole violations. In December 2006, he failed to report to his parole officer, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. In February 2007, a man matching Smith's description was detained by police in Los Angeles' Skid Row area and eventually identified as Smith. He was arrested, charged with violating his parole, and sent to the Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic, California. On April 7, 2007, while in that facility, he died of an apparent heart attack at age 76.\n\nThe book was adapted into an 1979 film of the same name directed by Harold Becker. It starred John Savage as Karl Hettinger, James Woods as Gregory Powell, Franklyn Seales as Jimmy Smith, and Ted Danson (in his film debut) as Ian Campbell.\n\nTNT's \"Southland\" season 5 episode 9 titled \"Chaos\" (original airdate April 10, 2013) portrayed a reimagined version of the events that took place in \"The Onion Field\".\n\nThe \"Adam-12\" episode \"Killing Ground\" was based on this incident. Officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed are kidnapped by two armed robbers on the run. The only difference is Malloy and Reed are able to escape and turn the tables on their captors.\n\n"}

It was one of 16 pulps that Margulies founded that incorporated the adjective \"Thrilling\" in the title.

The first edition of \"Thrilling Adventures\" was published in December 1931.\n\n\"Thrilling Adventures\" published fictional stories, mostly of the adventure and sports genres. It continued as a monthly until 1943, when it was reduced to a bimonthly, and the final issue was the November 1943 edition. A total of 139 issues were published during its existence.\n"}

He went on to Harvard University to pursue an M.A. (1906) and Ph.D. (1909). After receiving his Ph.D., he spent a year studying in Dublin, Ireland, then returned to the United States in 1910 to take up a position as an instructor at Harvard. In 1911 he became the head of the English department at Sweet Briar College. Following that, he spent his next year at the University of North Carolina, and in 1913 became the chair of the Department of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Chicago. His \"alma mater\" Hampden–Sydney College awarded him an honorary doctorate of literature in 1927. He was also member of the Modern Language Association and the American Council of the Irish Texts Society. He retired in 1945.\n\nOne major work of Cross' was \"A List of Books and Articles, Chiefly Bibliographical, Designed to Serve as an Introduction to the Bibliography and Methods of English Literary History\", first published in 1919; it would go through numerous editions, renamed from the 7th onwards as the \"Bibliographical Guide to English Studies\". Following his death it was expanded by Donald F. Bond as the \"Reference Guide to English Studies\". He also published a number of journal articles and a monograph on the Arthurian legends.\n\nCross' final work, the \"Motif-Index of Early Irish Literature\", whose compilation he had begun more than five decades earlier at the inspiration of Fred N. Robinson, was published post-humously as part of Indiana University Bloomington's Folklore Series in 1952. Stith Thompson, who visited him in late 1951, reported that he worked literally until the day he died reading the galley proofs in order to complete the corrections. Kenneth H. Jackson praised the \"Motif-Index\" as \"enormously comprehensive and so extremely useful\". However, William Sayers would half a century later criticise it as being limited by its \"original conceptual categories, where such modern notions as ideology, gender, physical aberrance, the abject and the like are absent\".\n\nCross was born in 1879 in Nansemond County, Virginia to Thomas Hardy Cross and Eleanor Elizabeth Wright. His father was a planter. He had one younger brother, Hardy Cross, who would go on to achieve fame in the field of structural engineering for his development of the moment distribution method. He and his brother both did their preparatory education at Norfolk Academy. Cross was married to Elizabeth Weathers Cross. He had two daughters, Ellen Elizabeth Cross and Evelyn Douglas Cross. The former married music scholar Storm Bull in 1939. At the end of his career, Cross retired to a farm in Aylett, Virginia, where he lived until his death. Late in life, he suffered a heart attack, and his poor health kept him from being able to climb stairs, but he still continued his work on his \"Motif-Index\". After his death, his wife moved to Boulder, Colorado, where she lived with Bull and her daughter until her own death in 1957.\n\n"}

It is one of the few public domain, present-day English translations of the entire Bible, and it is freely distributed to the public using electronic formats. The Bible was created by volunteers using the ASV as the base text as part of the ebible.org project through Rainbow Missions, Inc., a Colorado nonprofit corporation.\n\nThe World English Bible claims to be one of the few English-language Bibles custom translated to be understood by most English-speakers worldwide, eliminating the need for data-processing based or computer operating system-specific internationalizations. Work on the World English Bible began in 1997 and it was first known as the \"American Standard Version 1997\".\n\nThe World English Bible project was started in order to produce a modern English Bible version that is not copyrighted, does not use archaic English (such as the KJV), and is not translated into Basic English (such as the \"Bible In Basic English\"). The World English Bible follows the American Standard Version's decision to transliterate the Tetragrammaton, but uses \"Yahweh\" instead of \"Jehovah\" throughout the Old Testament. The British and Messianic editions as well as the Apocryphal books and New Testament use the traditional forms (e.g., the LORD).\n\nThe translation also includes the following Apocryphal books (in the following order):\n\nThe work is based on the 1901 \"American Standard Version\" English translation, the Greek \"Majority Text\", and the Hebrew \"Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia\" with some minor adjustments made because of alternate readings found in the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Septuagint. These alternate readings are usually ignored or restricted to the footnotes. The translation process included seven passes of editing and proofreading for each book. An initial automated pass updated approximately 1,000 archaic words, phrases and grammatical constructs. The first manual pass added quotation marks (the ASV had none) and other punctuation and compared the translation to the Greek and Hebrew texts in areas where significant textual variants or meanings were unclear.\n\nEvangelical site GotQuestions.org praised the WEB for being \"a modern, free, and public domain English translation of the Bible\" while also criticising the translation's sentence structure as \"not always in the most natural-sounding and free-flowing English\". The site suggests the lack of physical print copies has made the translation difficult for widespread adoption by Christian communities.\n\nThe Provident Planning web site uses the World English Bible because it is free of copyright restrictions and because the author considers it to be a good translation.\n\nThe Bible Megasite review of the World English Bible says it is a good revision of the American Standard Version of 1901 (ASV) into modern English, which also corrects some textual issues with the ASV.\n\nThe World English Bible is widely published in digital formats by a variety of publishers.\n\n\n"}
