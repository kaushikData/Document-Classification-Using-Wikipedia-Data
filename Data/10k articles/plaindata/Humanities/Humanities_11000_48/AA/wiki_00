Rebera is an Old Testament Scholar and a Translation Consultant with the United Bible Societies focusing on translations of the Bible the world over. As a contributor to scholarly research, Rebera's writings have been reviewed in Journal of Biblical Literature and The Bible Translator.\n\nIn 1975, Rebera took part in the second All-India Biblical Meeting held under the aegis of the National Biblical, Catechetical and Liturgical Centre in Bangalore led by Rev. Fr D. S. Amalorpavadass where Rebera presented a report on the Inter-Confessional translations of the Bible Society of India.\n\nRebera is an authority on Ruth and his linguistic analysis has caught the attention of many Translation scholars. Kristin Moen Saxegaard in \"Character Complexity in the Book of Ruth\" writes that \n\nFurther, Robert B. Chisholm of the Dallas Theological Seminary in \"Interpreting the Historical Books: An Exegetical Handbook\" writes that \n\nJoy Sisley of the Staffordshire University in her work, \"Power and Interpretive Authority in Multimedia Translation\" writes, \n\nRebera pursued graduate studies in theology from 1967-1971 at the United Theological College, Bangalore, the only autonomous College under the nation's first University, the Senate of Serampore College (University) where he obtained a Bachelor of Divinity \"(B. D.)\" during the Principalship of Joshua Russell Chandran. Incidentally, when the Old Testament Scholar and an alma mater of the College, Victor Premasagar happened to proceed to St. Andrew's University for research studies, he happened to stop over at the College and taught introductory Biblical Hebrew to the graduate students. As a student of Victor Premasagar, Rebera took interest in learning the ancient Biblical languages and went on to enroll for postgraduate studies in Biblical Studies specializing in Old Testament.\n\nDuring his collegiate studies, Rebera took an active part in literary pursuits and was made Assistant Editor of the \"UTC College Magazine\" during 1969-1970.\n\nSoon after Rebera completed his graduate studies, the Bible Society of India led by the clergy consisting of A. E. Inbanathan and C. Arangaden, then General Secretary and Associate General Secretary (Translations) respectively, chose Rebera to pursue post-graduate studies in Biblical Studies so that he would be an asset to the Bible Society of India. Rebera then continued his studies at the Seminary by enrolling into Master of Theology, specializing in Old Testament under E. C. John from 1971-1973 working out a dissertation entitled \"The meaning of mispat and sedeq/sedaqah in the pre-exilic prophetic literature and their translation in the Sinhalese Bible\". Rebera was part the pioneer group of postgraduate students who specialised in Old Testament comprising A. P. Chacko, G. Babu Rao, N. K. Achumi, S. J. Theodore and Timotheas Hembrom. The University awarded graduate and postgraduate degrees in the ensuing convocations during the Registrarship of C. Devasahayam.\n\nRebera and his erstwhile companions at the United Theological College, Bangalore comprising G. Babu Rao, S. J. Theodore, N. K. Achumi, A. P. Chacko, and Timotheas Hembrom were notable for their contribution to the Bible Society in translation and revision of the scriptures into other languages. While Timotheas Hembrom was involved in Santali language translation, N. K. Achumi was involved in translation/revision of the Bible in Naga language. Similarly, G. Babu Rao joined the Bible Society of India in 1973 as Translator of the Telugu Old Testament and a decade later, in 1984, became Coordinator of the Telugu Old Testament Common Language Translation (Telugu OT-CL) Project of the Bible Society of India which also took along S. J. Theodore on the panel of the Telugu OT-CL Project Team.\n\nE. C. John, the Professor of Rebera and his study companions was instrumental in infusing scholarly enthusiasm among his students. Known for his scholarship and administration, E. C. John was also involved in Malayalam translation of the Bible.\n\nFor research studies, Rebera studied at the Macquarie University and at the Australian National University and was awarded a doctorate by the Macquarie University in 1981 in Biblical Studies based on his dissertation entitled, \"The Book of Ruth: Dialogue and Narrative, the Function and Integration of the Two Modes in an Ancient Hebrew Story\".\n\nThe confidence reposed in Rebera by the clergy consisting of the rural Pastor, A. E. Inbanathan and C. Arangaden remained for posterity as Rebera metamorphosed himself into a Translation scholar.\n\nRebera began his career as a Translator with the Bible Society of India right from 1973 onwards.\n\nIn 1974, Rebera was appointed Translation Consultant by the United Bible Societies for the Asia-Pacific Region Region and was based in India, Thailand and Singapore, a position which he held until 1988 till he moved to the Bible Society Australia.\n\nIn his second stint starting in 1993 at the United Bible Societies, Rebera became Coordinator for the Global Translation Services at the United Bible Societies and was based in New York at the American Bible Society. Rebera was appointed in 1993-1994 and oversaw translations of the Bible into many languages and also the revision of the existing versions. Rebera worked closely with the Asia-Pacific Regional Translations Coordinator, Graham S. Ogden.\n\nIn 1988, Rebera took up the position of Director, Translation and Text Division of the Bible Society Australia. After a 6-year stint with the Bible Society Australia, Rebera again moved to the United Bible Societies in 1993.\n\n\nMany Theologian's have impacted the life and career of Rebera during his studies and initial ministry with the Bible Society of India. The legacy of these Theologians continues for posterity as each of them have contributed much to their respective fields in the theological sphere.\n"}

Becan is located near the center of the Yucatán Peninsula, in the present-day Mexican state of Campeche, about 150 km (93.2 mi) north of Tikal. The Maya sites of Balamku, Calakmul, Chicanna and Xpuhil are nearby. The name \"Becan\" was bestowed on the site by archaeologists who rediscovered the site, meaning \"ravine or canyon formed by water\" in Yukatek Maya, after the site's most prominent and unusual feature, its surrounding ditch.\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that Becan was occupied in the middle Preclassic Maya period, about 550 BCE, and grew to a major population and ceremonial center a few hundred years later in the late Preclassic. The population and scale of construction declined in the early classic (c 250 CE), although it was still a significant site, and trade goods from Teotihuacan have been found. A ditch and ramparts were constructed around the site at this time. There is a ditch that runs the circumference of the city which covers approximately 25 hectares (61.7 acres). Around 500 the population again increased dramatically and many large new buildings were constructed, mostly in the \"Rio Bec\" style of Maya architecture. Construction of major buildings and elite monuments stopped about 830, although ceramic evidence show that the site continued to be occupied for some time thereafter, although the population went into decline and Becan was probably abandoned by about 1200. \n\nThe site was first documented in the archaeological literature in 1934 by archaeologists Karl Ruppert and John Denison on an expedition to the region sponsored by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, who named it \"Becan\" after the conspicuous ditch surrounding the center of the city; the ancient name of the site is not known. From 1969 to 1971 archaeological excavations were made at Becan sponsored by Tulane University and the National Geographic Society.\n\nIn 1984, while conducting research at the site, one of Mexico's \"most important archeologists\", Román Piña Chán, fell from the pyramid at Becán, becoming paralyzed. On 13 July 2001, at a homage paid to Piña by the National Museum of Anthropology, it was announced that Lucía Campaña, had discovered a pre-Hispanic tomb in the ninth building at the site, the previous day.\n\nBenavides Castillo, Antonio.

This is despite the tempting, though superficial, paradox that secrecy is of the essence in sending confidential messages — see Kerckhoffs' principle.\n\nIn contrast, the revolutions in cryptography and secure communications since the 1970s are well covered in the available literature.\n\nAn early example of a book about cryptography was a Roman work, now lost and known only by references. Many early cryptographic works were esoteric, mystical, and/or reputation-promoting; cryptography being mysterious, there was much opportunity for such things. At least one work by Trithemius was banned by the Catholic Church and put on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum as being about black magic or witchcraft. Many writers claimed to have invented unbreakable ciphers. None were, though it sometimes took a long while to establish this.\n\nIn the 19th century, the general standard improved somewhat (e.g., works by Auguste Kerckhoffs, Friedrich Kasiski, and Étienne Bazeries). Colonel Parker Hitt and William Friedman in the early 20th century also wrote books on cryptography. These authors, and others, mostly abandoned any mystical or magical tone.\n\nWith the invention of radio, much of military communications went wireless, allowing the possibility of enemy interception much more readily than tapping into a landline. This increased the need to protect communications. By the end of World War I, cryptography and its literature began to be officially limited. One exception was The American Black Chamber by Herbert Yardley, which gave some insight into American cryptologic success stories, including the Zimmermann telegram and the breaking of Japanese codes during the Washington Naval Conference.\n\nFrom the end of World War II until the early 1980s most aspects of modern cryptography were regarded as the special concern of governments and the military, and were protected by custom and, in some cases, by statute. The most significant work to be published on cryptography in this period is undoubtedly David Kahn's \"The Codebreakers\", which was published at a time (mid-1960s) when virtually no information on the modern practice of cryptography was available. Kahn has said that over ninety percent of its content was previously unpublished. \n\nThe book caused serious concern at the NSA despite its lack of coverage of specific modern cryptographic practice, so much so that after failing to prevent the book being published, NSA staff were informed to not even acknowledge the existence of the book if asked. In the US military, mere possession of a copy by cryptographic personnel was grounds for some considerable suspicion. Perhaps the single greatest importance of the book was the impact it had on the next generation of cryptographers. Whitfield Diffie has made comments in interviews about the effect it had on him.\n\nSignificant books on cryptography include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7535429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7535429", "title": "Chess in the arts", "text": "Chess in the arts\n\nChess became a source of inspiration in the arts in literature soon after the spread of the game to the Arab World and Europe in the Middle Ages. The earliest works of art centered on the game are miniatures in medieval manuscripts, as well as poems, which were often created with the purpose of describing the rules. After chess gained popularity in the 15th and 16th centuries, many works of art related to the game were created. One of the most well-known, Marco Girolamo Vida's \"Scacchia ludus\", written in 1527, made such an impression on the readers that it singlehandedly inspired other authors to create poems about chess.\n\nIn the 20th century, artists created many works related to the game, sometimes taking their inspiration from the life of famous players (Vladimir Nabokov in \"The Defense\") or well-known games (Poul Anderson in \"Immortal Game\", John Brunner in \"The Squares of the City\"). Some authors invented new chess variants in their works, such as stealth chess in Terry Pratchett's \"Discworld\" series or Tri-Dimensional chess in the \"Star Trek\" series.\n\nPalatine Chapel in the Norman Palace in Palermo you can admire the first painting of a chess game that is known to the world. The work dates from around 1143 and the artists who created the Muslims were chosen by the Norman king of Sicily Roger II of Hauteville, who erected the church.\nThe earliest known reference to chess in a European text is a Medieval Latin poem, \"Versus de scachis\". The oldest manuscript containing this poem has been given the estimated date of 997. Other early examples include miniatures accompanying books. Some of them have high artistic value. Perhaps the best known example is the 13th-century \"Libro de los juegos\". The book contains 151 illustrations, and while most of them are centered on the board, showing problems, the players and architectural settings are different in each picture. The pieces illustrating chess problems in Luca Pacioli's manuscript \"De ludo scacchorum\" () (c. 1500), described as \"futuristic\" even by today's standards, may have been designed by Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nAfter chess became gradually more popular in Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, especially in Spain and Italy, many artists began writing poems using chess as a theme. \"Scachs d'amor\" (), written by an unknown artist in the end of the 15th century, describes a game between Mars and Venus, using chess as an allegory of love. The story also serves as a pretence to describe the rules of the game. \"De ludo scacchorum\" (unrelated to the manuscript mentioned above) by , also created at that time, is a collection of gameplay advice, presented in poetic fashion.\n\nOne of the most influential works of chess-related art is Marco Girolamo Vida's \"Scaccia ludus\" (1527), centered on a game played between Apollo and Mercury on Mount Olympus. It is said that, because of its high artistry, the poem made a great impression on anyone who read it, including Desiderius Erasmus. It also directly inspired at least two other works. The first is Jan Kochanowski's poem \"Chess\" (c. 1565), which describes the game as a battle between two armies, while the second is William Jones'\" Caissa, or the game of chess\" (1772). The latter poem popularised the pseudo-ancient Greek dryad Caïssa to be the \"goddess of chess\".\n\nSince the 19th century, artists have been creating novels and – since the 20th century – films related to chess. Sometimes, they are inspired by famous games, like John Brunner's \"The Squares of the City\", structured after the famous match between Wilhelm Steinitz and Mikhail Chigorin; Poul Anderson's short story \"Immortal Game\", inspired by the 1851 game played by Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky (which also appears in the film \"Blade Runner\"); or Waldemar Łysiak's \"Szachista\" (), centered on a game played between Napoleon Bonaparte and The Turk. The game Frank Poole versus HAL 9000 from the film \"\" is also based on an actual match, albeit not widely known.\n\nOther artists drawn their inspirations from the life of players. Vladimir Nabokov wrote \"The Defense\" after learning about Curt von Bardeleben, while the musical \"Chess\" was loosely based on the life of Bobby Fischer. Some authors invented new chess variants in their works, such as stealth chess in Terry Pratchett's \"Discworld\" series or Tri-Dimensional chess in the \"Star Trek\" series.\n\nOne unusual connection between art and chess is the life of Marcel Duchamp, who almost fully suspended his artistic career to focus on chess in 1923.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the popularity of the game became widespread during the 15th and 16th centuries, so too did the number of paintings depicting the subject. Continuing into the 20th century, artists created works related to the game often taking inspiration from the life of famous players or well-known games. An unusual connection between art and chess is the life of Marcel Duchamp, who in 1923 almost fully suspended his artistic career to focus on chess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Full professor at the Universidad de Santiago de Chile, researcher at the Institute for Advanced Studies (Instituto de Estudios Avanzados), and Director of the Master in Social Sciences with major in Civil Society Studies program. One of his major works is Popular Religion and Modernization in Latin America (Orbis) with Spanish and Portuguese versions.\n\nHis academic background includes different universities, such as Universidad Católica de Chile and Université Catholique de Louvain, where he got his training; Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano and Universidad de Santiago de Chile, where he has worked preferentially.\n\nDuring his academic career he has contributed to the sociology of religion and culture, publishing various works in this field of knowledge. In 1993 he published a book on popular religions and modernization in Latin America, under the title “Otra Lógica en América Latina, Religión popular y modernización capitalista” He has authored or coautored 22 books and 81 book chapters and 91 publications in scientific journals; he has also given conferences in no less than 15 Chilean universities and in 30 universities in America, Europe and Asia (258 presentations or conferences).\n\nHe has been Director of the School of Sociology, Dean of Social Science (1989-1995) at the Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano, and then he was Vice-president of Research and Development (2002-2003) and Director of the of the Universidad de Santiago de Chile (2005- 2010).\nHe has been a consultant for UNICEF, UNDP, ECLAC, FLACSO-Ecuador, and various public agencies in Chile, among them ministries of Education, of Development and Justice. In addition he has lectured in Research Methodology in the Academia Diplomática de Chile (2004-2012) and the Master's program in Military History and Strategic Thought of the War Academy of the Chilean Army (2004-2015)\n\nIt has been stated that the work of C. Parker enables a complete knowledge of popular culture with an empathic and participative approach on the “culture of the poor”. His contribution to the sociology of religion, underscoring its cultural character, rich in creativity, has led to the reevaluation of lived religion, i.e., to the noninstitutional character of religion. That is why his criticisms of the ecclesiocentric bias of the sociology of western religion have been the subject of relevant publications.\nAccording to Roberto Cipriani, Cristián Parker in his work “has analyzed with scientífic rigor the crossing of popular and official culture, revealing congruences and incongruences, points of contact and contrast through theoretical and empirical work made along a trip that has lasted 30 years, aimed at discovering what he calls the “other logic” of popular culture (...). On the other hand, an extensive analysis of the relation between religion and politics from a democratic perspective is not missing\". The work of C. Parker is consulted by specialists and those interested in Latin America’s sociocultural and religious evolution.\n\nProfessor Parker has contributed to the sociology of development, especially in his analysis of new ways of understanding the relation between culture and development. In particular, he has conducted research on the social representations of social actors challenged by the radical scientific and technological innovations in the context of unequal globalization and on the environmental crisis, climate change, and energy transition in South American societies.\n\nDuring the time in which Chile was governed under the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, he became an active actor of a Catholic church and of the ecumenical efforts in defense of human rights and the return to democracy. In those days he became committed with the Church's base communities that fought inspired by the Liberation Theology.\nAs the country turned to democracy, and after the Chilean national plebiscite, 1988 and the election of Patricio Aylwin as president of the democratic Concertación, he oriented his life toward academic work.\nDuring this time he has contributed in key and strategic issues of the social sciences for the construction of democracy in Chile: development of indigenous people, overcoming poverty, social and political participation of youngsters, ethics and democracy, and the challenges of climate change and sustainable development.\n\nThe writings of C.

They were so named by Western observers and historians due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons of ancient Anatolia and the Black Sea.\n\nKing Houegbadja (who ruled from 1645 to 1685), the third King of Dahomey, is said to have originally started the group which would become the Amazons as a corps of elephant hunters called the \"gbeto\".\n\nHouegbadja's son King Agaja (ruling from 1708 to 1732) established a female bodyguard armed with muskets. European merchants recorded their presence. According to tradition, Agaja developed the bodyguard into a militia and successfully used them in Dahomey's defeat of the neighbouring kingdom of Savi in 1727. The group of female warriors was referred to as \"Mino\", meaning \"Our Mothers\" in the Fon language, by the male army of Dahomey. Other sources contest that King Agaja's older sister Queen Hangbe was the ruler to establish the units, however some contest if Queen Hangbe actually existed.\n\nFrom the time of King Ghezo (ruling from 1818 to 1858), Dahomey became increasingly militaristic. Ghezo placed great importance on the army, increasing its budget and formalizing its structure from ceremonial to a serious military. While European narratives refer to the women soldiers as \"Amazons\", they called themselves \"ahosi\" (king's wives) or \"Mino\" (our mothers). Europeans exchanged goods such as knives, bayonets, firearms and fabrics for prisoners that the Dahomey captured during wars and raids.\n\nGhezo recruited both men and women soldiers from foreign captives, though women soldiers were also recruited from free Dahomean women, some enrolled as young as 8 years old. Other accounts indicate that the \"Mino\" were recruited from among the \"ahosi\" (\"king's wives\") of which there were often hundreds. Some women in Fon society became soldiers voluntarily, while others were involuntarily enrolled if their husbands or fathers complained to the king about their behavior.\n\nMembership among the \"Mino\" was supposed to hone any aggressive character traits for the purpose of war. During their membership they were not allowed to have children or be part of married life (though they were legally married to the king). Many of them were virgins. The regiment had a semi-sacred status, which was intertwined with the Fon belief in Vodun.\n\nThe \"Mino\" trained with intense physical exercise. They learnt survival skills and indifference to pain and death, storming acacia-thorn defenses in military exercises and executing prisoners. Discipline was emphasised.\n\nServing in the \"Mino\" offered women the opportunity to \"rise to positions of command and influence\" in an environment structured for individual empowerment. The \"Mino\" were also wealthy and held high status.\n\nThe \"Mino\" took a prominent role in the Grand Council, debating the policy of the kingdom. From the 1840s to 1870s (when the opposing party collapsed), they generally supported peace with Abeokuta and stronger commercial relations with England, favouring the trade in palm oil above that in slaves; this set them at odds with their male military colleagues.\n\nApart from the Council, the Annual Customs of Dahomey included a parade and reviewing of the troops, and the troops swearing of an oath to the king. The celebrations on the 27th day of the Annual Customs consisted of a mock battle in which the Amazons attacked a \"fort\" and \"captured\" the slaves within, a custom recorded by the priest Francesco Borghero in his diaries.\n\nThe women soldiers were rigorously trained and given uniforms. By the mid-19th century, they numbered between 1,000 and 6,000 women, about a third of the entire Dahomey army, according to reports written by visitors. These documented reports also indicated that the women soldiers suffered several defeats.\n\nThe women soldiers were said to be structured in parallel with the army as a whole, with a center wing (the king's bodyguards) flanked on both sides, each under separate commanders. Some accounts note that each male soldier had a female warrior counterpart. In an 1849/50 account by an Englishman, it was documented that the women that had three stripes of whitewash around each leg, were honored with marks of distinction.\n\nThe women's army consisted of a number of regiments: huntresses, riflewomen, reapers, archers, and gunners. Each regiment had different uniforms, weapons and commanders.\n\nIn the latter period, the Dahomean female warriors were armed with Winchester rifles, clubs and knives. Units were under female command. A 1851 published translation of a war chant of the women claims the warriors would chant, \"a[s] the blacksmith takes an iron bar and by fire changes its fashion so have we changed our nature. We are no longer women, we are men.\" \n\nThe Dahomey kingdom was often at war with its neighbors, and captives were needed for the slave trade. The Dahomey women soldiers fought in slave raids, as referenced in the Zora Neale Hurston non-fiction work , and in the unsuccessful wars against Abeokuta.\n\nEuropean encroachment into West Africa gained pace during the latter half of the 19th century, and in 1890 King Béhanzin started fighting French forces in the course of the First Franco-Dahomean War. European observers noted that they \"handled admirably\" in hand to hand combat, but that they did not know how to use their flintlocks. The Amazons participated in one major battle: Cotonou, where thousands of Dahoney (including many Amazons) charged the French lines and engaged the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. Despite the compliments given to them by the Europeans, the Amazons were decisively crushed, with several hundred Dahomey troops being gunned down while 129 Dahomey were killed in melee combat within the French lines. The French lost 5 men killed and a few dozen wounded. \n\nAccording to Holmes, many of the French soldiers fighting in Dahomey hesitated before shooting or bayoneting the Amazons. The resulting delay led to many of the French casualties. By the end of the Second Franco-Dahomean War, special units of the Amazons were being assigned specifically to target French officers. After several battles, the French prevailed in the Second Franco-Dahomean War and put an end to the independent Dahomean kingdom. The legionnaires were impressed by the boldness of the Amazons and later wrote about the \"incredible courage and audacity.\" Against a military unit with decidedly superior weaponry and a longer bayonet, however, the Dahomey Amazons could not prevail. During a battle with French soldiers at Adegon on October 6 during the second war, the bulk of the Amazon corps were wiped out in a matter of hours in hand-to-hand combat after the French engaged them with a bayonet charge. For the loss of 86 Regulars and 417 Amazons, the Dahomey only managed to kill 6 French troops in the melee.\n\nThe troops were disbanded when the kingdom became a French protectorate. Oral tradition states that some surviving amazons secretly remained in Abomey afterwards, where they quietly assassinated a number of French officers. Other stories say the women pledged their services in protection of Agoli-Agbo, the brother of Béhanzin, disguising themselves as his wives in order to guard him.\n\nSome of the women married and had children, while others remained single. According to a historian who traced the lives of almost two dozen ex-amazons, all the women displayed difficulties adjusting to life as retired warriors, often struggling to find new roles in their communities that gave them a sense of pride comparable to their former lives. Many displayed a tendency to start fights or arguments that frightened their neighbours and relatives.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1942, several British travelers in Abomey recorded encounters with ex-amazons, now old women who spun cotton or idled around courtyards. The last survivor of the Dahomey Amazons is thought to have been a woman named Nawi. In a 1978 interview with a Beninese historian, Nawi claimed to have fought the French in 1892. Nawi died in November 1979, aged well over 100.\n\nDahomey Amazons were represented in the 1987 film \"Cobra Verde\" by German director Werner Herzog. Ghezo's Amazons play a significant role in the novel \"Flash for Freedom!\" by George MacDonald Fraser.\n\nThe unit is also depicted in (a special edition of, and now DLC of) PC game \"\". In the African Kingdoms expansion to \"Age of Empires II\", Gbeto are the Malian unique unit. In either game, the Dahomey/Gbeto are the only female military units.\n\nA segment of \"QI\" Series 7 Episode 7 discussed Dahomey Amazons and showed a photo.\n\nReferenced in Stieg Larsson's novel \"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\" in the prelude to Part 4 \"Rebooting System\".\n\nThe warriors are also mentioned in Patrick O'Brian's novel \"The Commodore\", book 17 of the Aubrey-Maturin series.\n\nThe main character of Charles R. Saunders fantasy novel \"Dossouye\", an ahosi of Abomey, is closely modelled on the Dahomey ahosi.\n\nP. C. Wren's 1917 book of short stories \"Stepsons of France\" contains a story called \"Here are Ladies\", describing a series of clashes between troops of the Foreign Legion and the Dahomey Amazons.\n\nThe warriors are also the main focus and written about in Layon Gray's stage play \"Black Sparta\".\n\nThe Dora Milaje, army/bodyguards to the \"Black Panther\", are based partially off the Dahomey Amazons.\n\nIn Zora Neale Hurston’s \"\", 86 year old Cudjo Lewis, the last known survivor of the slaver Clotilda, describes his own capture by Dahomey Amazons when he was 19 years old.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The book, which was the first of four released about the case, details the homicide investigation and ensuing trial and re-trial of Ted Binion’s live-in girlfriend Sandy Murphy and her lover Rick Tabish in connection with Binion's death.\n\nThe book is an in-depth look at the life and death of Lonnie Theodore \"Ted\" Binion, the 54-year-old heir to Binion's Horseshoe Casino, who died from a drug overdose on September 17, 1998. The book seeks to resolve whether Binion was murdered by Murphy and Tabish or accidentally overdosed on drugs he had purchased in the days before his death. It includes historical photos of the Binion family from the archives of the Las Vegas News Bureau and University of Nevada, Las Vegas's Lied Library \"Special Collections.\"\n\nThe murder motive, the prosecution contended, was Binion's $50 million estate. In his will, he left Murphy $300,000 cash in addition to his $900,000 house and its contents, which included original paintings and a silver coin collection kept in a safe inside the house.\n\nThe author interviewed the defendants before and after the first trial and re-trial, which was dubbed Las Vegas's \"trial of the century.\"\n\n\"Death in the Desert\", a full-length film that completed shooting in Las Vegas in February 2014, is based on the book of the same title with the script by screenwriter John Steppling. Directed and produced by Josh Evans, it stars Michael Madsen as Ted Binion (played as Ray), Shayla Beesley as Sandy Murphy (played as Kim) and Paz de la Huerta as Kim's friend Margo, with a musical score by record producer Chris Goss and performed by singer Roxy Saint.

The Team was created as a conclusion of the European Council meeting on 19 and 20 March 2015, stressing the need to challenge the ongoing disinformation campaigns by Russia.“\n\nThe East Stratcom Team is intended to develop dedicated communication material on priority issues, where EU strategic communication needs to be improved or the EU is subject to disinformation campaigns. Such products will be put at the disposal of the EU's political leadership, press services, EU delegations and EU Member States and are intended for the widest possible public audience. The Team is designated to develop communication campaigns, targeting key audiences and focused on specific issues of relevance to those audiences, including local issues. The actions of the East Stratcom Team are built on existing work and coherent with wider EU communication efforts, including activities of the EU institutions and EU Member States.\n\nThe team's positive communications products are mainly focused on the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood and produced in the local languages of those countries. They are distributed via social media channels of the EU Delegations in the region, and are also carried on television and via other media and public events. In addition, the Task Force, in cooperation with the European Commission, led the EU's six month Eastern Partnership communications campaign culminating in the November 2017 Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels.\n\nThe team's main product to raise awareness of disinformation is the weekly Disinformation Review (in English and Russian languages). This can provide valuable data for analysts, journalists and officials dealing with this issue. The Disinformation Review also brings the latest news and analyses of pro-Kremlin disinformation. Launched in November 2015, the Disinformation Review has been described as \"the best weekly disinformation bulletin anywhere in the West\". The full record of the Task Force's work on disinformation is available on its website EUvsDisinfo.eu (in English, Russian and German languages). The team also runs the European External Action Service's Russian language website. It is also possible to follow the team on Twitter and Facebook. This communicates primarily about the EU's foreign policy by publishing information about EU activities, as well as EU statements and press releases with relevance to the Eastern Neighbourhood in particular.\n\nEU Member State Governments have strongly supported the Task Force since its inception and provide the majority of its staff.\n\nThe European Parliament has consistently supported the Task Force and called for adequate staffing and resourcing. An EP preparatory action for 2018 – \"StratCom Plus\" - has allocated €1.1m for the team to focus on how to counter disinformation on the EU more systematically.\n\nAn article published October 2016 on Kommunikations Forum analyses the sources East StratCom use for debunking alleged disinformation. It criticizes the top three sites, Ukrainian StopFake, EU and NATO, for not being objective credible sources in this regard.\n\nAn opinion piece written by Danish commentator, Iben Thranholm, published on Russia Insider October 2015, were listed by East StratCom as pro-Kremlin disinformation. Member of the Danish Parliament, Marie Krarup, upon discovery raised the issue in January 2017, demanding Foreign Minister, Anders Samuelsen, to take action and stop ‘black listing’ of opinions, which he declined as the listing in his view was correctly labeled 'disinformation in support for Russia'. In response 28 commentators wrote a joint critique stressing their concern that ‘anybody with a critical view on mass immigration could end up in the black book of EU’.\n\nAn article published October 2016 on Folkets Avis, lists several instances, where East StratCom has labelled critique of non Western immigration to EU as pro-Kremlin disinformation, regardless that neither the media or the content has any relation to Russia.\n\nResearch conducted by investigative journalists at Danish newspaper, Politiken, showed that East StratCom along with Western media falsely blamed separatists, not government forces, in Eastern Ukraine for initiating an offensive in the area of Avdiivka in January 2017. Sources used by East StratCom included InformNapalm which the article shows has ties to Ukrainian death list, Myrotvorets (Peacemaker) that lists people including journalists as 'traitors' for expressing certain opinions or visiting separatist controlled areas in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nUpon discovery of being listed for publishing pro-Kremlin disinformation, three Dutch major media organisations has sued the EU for libel. On 6 March 2018, a majority of 109 votes to 41 of the Dutch Parliament voted to close EUvsDisinfo. On 8 March 2018, East StratCom announced they had deleted the listings of Dutch media in their database \"following a detailed review\". On 9 March 2018, Dutch Minister of the Interior, who had previously opposed closing EUvsDisinfo, said that the government would make a case for closing it in the European Union. On 13 March 2018 the three Dutch media withdrew their case.\n\n"}

The FTC has been studying online privacy issues since 1995, and in its 1998 report, the Commission described the widely accepted Fair Information Practice Principles of \"Notice, Choice, Access, and Security\". The Commission also identified \"Enforcement\", the use of a reliable mechanism to provide sanctions for noncompliance as a critical component of any governmental or self-regulatory program to protect online privacy.\n\nFair Information Practice was initially proposed and named by the \"US Secretary's Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems\" in a 1973 report, \"Records, Computers and the Rights of Citizens\", issued in response to the growing use of automated data systems containing information about individuals. The central contribution of the Advisory Committee was the development of a code of fair information practice for automated personal data systems. \nThe Privacy Protection Study Commission also may have contributed to the development of FIPs principles in its 1977 report, \"Personal Privacy in an Information Society\".\n\nAs privacy laws spread to other countries in Europe, international institutions took up privacy with a focus on the international implications of privacy regulation. In 1980, the Council of Europe adopted a Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data. At the same time, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) proposed similar privacy guidelines in the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data. The OECD Guidelines, Council of Europe Convention, and European Union Data Protection Directive relied on FIPs as core principles. All three organizations revised and extended the original U.S. statement of FIPs, with the OECD Privacy Guidelines being the version most often cited in subsequent years.\n\nThe core principles of privacy addressed by these principles are:\n\n1. Notice/Awareness \nConsumers should be given notice of an entity's information practices before any personal information is collected from them. This requires that companies explicitly notify some or all of the following:\n\n2. Choice/Consent\nChoice and consent in an on-line information-gathering sense means giving consumers options to control how their data is used. Specifically, choice relates to secondary uses of information beyond the immediate needs of the information collector to complete the consumer's transaction. The two typical types of choice models are 'opt-in' or 'opt-out.' The 'opt-in' method requires that consumers affirmatively give permission for their information to be used for other purposes. Without the consumer taking these affirmative steps in an 'opt-in' system, the information gatherer assumes that it cannot use the information for any other purpose. The 'opt-out' method requires consumers to affirmatively decline permission for other uses. Without the consumer taking these affirmative steps in an 'opt-out' system, the information gatherer assumes that it \"can\" use the consumer's information for other purposes. Each of these systems can be designed to allow an individual consumer to tailor the information gatherer's use of the information to fit their preferences by checking boxes to grant or deny permission for specific purposes rather than using a simple \"all or nothing\" method.\n\n2-1. Problems with Choice/Consent \nConsumers do not have a fair say in the consent process. For example, customers provide their health information such as their social insurance number or health card number while making on-line an appointment for a dental check-up. Customers are commonly asked to sign an agreement stating that a ‘third-party may have an access to the information you provide under certain conditions.’ The certain conditions are rarely specified in any part of the agreement. Later on, the third-party may share the information with their subsidiary institutions. Thus, access to customers’ personal information is beyond their control.\n\n3. Access/Participation\nAccess as defined in the Fair Information Practice Principles includes not only a consumer's ability to view the data collected, but also to verify and contest its accuracy. This access must be inexpensive and timely in order to be useful to the consumer.\n\n4. Integrity/Security\nInformation collectors should ensure that the data they collect is accurate and secure. They can improve the integrity of data by cross-referencing it with only reputable databases and by providing access for the consumer to verify it. Information collectors can keep their data secure by protecting against both internal and external security threats. They can limit access within their company to only necessary employees to protect against internal threats, and they can use encryption and other computer-based security systems to stop outside threats.\n\n5. Enforcement/Redress\nIn order to ensure that companies follow the Fair Information Practice Principles, there must be enforcement measures. The FTC identified three types of enforcement measures: self-regulation by the information collectors or an appointed regulatory body; private remedies that give civil causes of action for individuals whose information has been misused to sue violators; and government enforcement that can include civil and criminal penalties levied by the government.\n\nCurrently the FTC version of the Fair Information Principles are only recommendations for maintaining privacy-friendly, consumer-oriented data collection practices, and are not enforceable by law. The enforcement of and adherence to these principles is principally performed through self-regulation. The FTC has, however, undertaken efforts to evaluate industry self-regulation practices, provides guidance for industry in developing information practices, and uses its authority under the FTC Act to enforce promises made by corporations in their privacy policies.\n\nSince self-regulatory initiatives fall short of ideal implementation of the principles (the 2000 FTC Report noted, for example, that self-regulatory initiatives lacked meaningful monitoring and enforcement policies and practices), the Commission recommends that the United States Congress enact legislation that, in conjunction with continuing self-regulatory programs, will ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy online. \"The legislation recommended by the Commission would set forth a basic level of privacy protection for consumer-oriented commercial Web sites\" and \"would establish basic standards of practice for the collection of information online...consumer-oriented commercial Web sites that collect personal identifying information from or about consumers online... would be required to comply with the four widely-accepted fair information practices.\"\n\nThe principles, however, form the basis of many individual laws at the both federal and state levels—called the \"sectoral approach.\" Examples are the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA), and the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act. Additionally, the principles continue to serve as a model for privacy protections in newly developing areas, such as in designing Smart Grid programs.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Union, among others, have adopted more comprehensive approaches to fair information practices. The OECD principles provide added protections via the \"Individual Participation principle\" where specific requirements are made for access and modification of personally collected information by the individual and the \"Accountability principle\" (a data controller should be accountable for complying with measures which give effect to the principles stated above).\n\nThe European Union Data Protection Directive is another model for comprehensive privacy protections.\n\nThe FIPPs are criticized by some scholars for being less comprehensive in scope than privacy regimes in other countries, in particular in the European Union and other OECD countries. Additionally, the FTC's formulation of the principles has been criticized in comparison to those issued by other agencies. The FTC's 2000 version of FIPs is shorter and less complete than the privacy protection principles issued by the Privacy Office of the Department of Homeland Security in 2008, which include eight principles closely aligned with the OECD principles.\n\nSome in the privacy community criticize the FIPPs for being too weak, allowing too many exemptions, failing to require a privacy agency, failing to account for the weaknesses of self-regulation, and not keeping pace with information technology. Many privacy experts have called for omnibus privacy protection legislation in the US in lieu of the current blend of self-regulation and selective codification in certain sectors.\n\nCritics from a business perspective often prefer to limit FIPs to reduced elements of notice, consent, and accountability. They complain that other elements are unworkable, expensive, or inconsistent with openness or free speech principles.\n\n\n"}

Baen Books and Flint decline the distinction, counting this book as the sixth published work.

However, Schultheiss's religious warnings were not heeded due to politics and economics both made Grantville attractive to Badenburg. Schultheiss continued to condemn Grantville's practices until his outcries infuriated his wife, who has a positive view on Grantville. Eventually, with guidance from his wife, Schultheiss changed his stance on Grantville and becomes more tolerated on the Americans' ideals, including freedom of religion.\n\nThe story is a police procedural that follows two policemen Jurgen Neubert, a down-time farmer and former mercenary soldier turned cop, and Marvin Tipton, a long service cop, through a murder case.\n\n\"An Invisible War\" is a short novel that was the first serialized piece of longer fiction that spanned this and the next Gazette in their e-published versions—though the whole (110 pages) was published in the hardcover release of \"Grantville Gazette II\". The tale set mostly in 1633 after Grantville has had time to settle-in and look beyond immediate survival issues. It deals with public health and integration and dissemination of medical knowledge efforts during the end of the Confederated Principalities of Europe and early United States of Europe period, for the various Mike Stearns-led administration's have been repeatedly reminded by and Melissa Mailey how vulnerable populations are and were to diseases in the seventeenth century era—so the up-timers have been both strategically aware and taking steps from the outset within their capabilities and resources to mitigate any preventable health problems beginning in the novel 1632. To add impetus and urgency, as time goes by in the experience of Grantville, some of the historical research conducted in the two libraries reveals that plague outbreaks occurred locally in OTL in diverse regions during 1632, 1634, and 1635 saw a large epidemic-size outbreak. Worse, the historical record might also indicate other outbreaks, which were poorly documented.\n\nThe story is one of Grantville's medical personnel meeting head-on with down-timer University practices, prejudices and a college curricula based in large part on the Classics and Theological studies. The town establishes the Lahey Clinic hospital near the Grantville High School and establishes a local nurse training program in 1631–1632, and by the summer of 1633 has reached out to the faculty of the University of Jena, but the only spareable medical manpower to head up a college of medicine are... women!\n\nA reviewer for Rosboch Book Reviews called the book \"a mixed bag\" with \"some of the stories are cute, some are more serious.\" Another reviewer at Goodreads called the book \"A fun and quick read although the non-fiction articles can get pretty dry.\"\n\nThe Grantville Gazette II was listed on the Locus (magazine) Hardcovers Bestsellers List for a single month in 2006 at number 10.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On the medallion's reverse side the image of a globe being exchanged between two hands is displayed.\n\nAs written by the Heinz Family Foundation, the candidates who are chosen must meet three standards:\n\nFirst, nominees must exhibit the following personal characteristics: A passion for excellence that goes beyond intellectual curiosity; a concern for humanity rooted in a deep sensitivity for the well-being of others; and a broad vision which extends far beyond the particular and embraces something universal.\n\nSecond, work of the candidates for a Heinz Award must meet the following criteria: Be significant and not a \"quick fix\"; Have an enduring and meaningful impact; be creative and innovative; and be sufficiently tangible to serve as a model for replication elsewhere.\n\nThird, candidates should be actively working in the field in which they are nominated so that this award will enhance their potential for future societal contribution.\n\nMembers of an anonymous Council of Nominators are chosen for their expertise in the fields relevant to the award for which they will be nominating. After the nominators have chosen the candidates, the nominations are forwarded to a jury consisting of noted experts in each of the five categories. The jury then chooses the final recipients and sends these to the program’s Board for final approval.\n\nIn certain years, the Heinz Awards Board has also chosen to honor the lifetime achievement of a particular individual. The award is a non-monetary prize, and the honoree is presented with the Awards' medallion at the same ceremony as the other laureates.\n\nIn 2009, in honor of the awards' 15th anniversary, an award for special focus on the environment was created in lieu of the traditional five awards. A larger group of 10 individuals were awarded 100,000 each, honoring those working in innovative ways to address the environment through the lens of the existing five categories.\n\nSimilarly, in 2010 and 2011 the Special Focus was continued, and in both years 10 individuals were again each awarded 100,000 each. In 2012, the Awards returned to the core five categories.\n\n"}

Such humor ranges from mild burlesque to derisive attacks. Catholic clergy and lay organizations such as the Catholic League monitor for particularly offensive and derogatory incidents and voice their objections and protests.\n\nExamples of fairly mild burlesque of the Church in the twentieth century include material by humourists such as the Irish comedian Dave Allen and the comedy show\" Father Ted.\"\n\nTraditional fears about the Roman Catholic Church were burlesqued by Monty Python in their Spanish Inquisition sketch (first aired September 22, 1970) in which hapless victims of the Spanish Inquisition are threatened with the 'comfy chair' and other such innocuous implements of torture.\n\nAnother sketch by Monty Python featured a song \"Every Sperm Is Sacred\" (1983) which is a satire of Catholic teachings on reproduction which forbid masturbation and contraception by artificial means. The sketch is about a Catholic Dad (played by Michael Palin), his wife (Mum, played by Terry Jones) and their 63 children, who are about to be sold for medical experimentation purposes because their parents can no longer afford to care for such a large family. When their children ask why they don't use contraception or sterilization, Dad explains that this is against God's wishes, and breaks into the song \"Every Sperm is Sacred\". The real punchline comes a bit later, as a scoffing Protestant Husband (played by Graham Chapman), after observing the large family's song and dance, briefly describes this \"typical catholic\" situation to his wife (Eric Idle). He goes on to remark how, as a Protestant, he could down to the store and unashamedly buy a condom, and that way, \"because I'm a Protestant\", intercourse is not bound to pregnancy, and therefore, available to them any time they wish. Protestant Wife's quietly excited reaction reveals, however, that they've never availed themselves of this option, turning the joke back round on the scoffing Protestants.\n\nIrishman Dave Allen (1936–2005) was the host of several comedy series broadcast on UK TV from the 1960s to the 1990s. The most controversial was called \"Dave Allen at Large\", which broadcast 1971–79 on UK TV. The programmes consisted of an introductory standup routine by Allen leading to handsomely mounted sketches that continued on the themes touched on in the opening monologue. The comedian's trademark debunking of religious, especially Catholic, ritual throughout each episode made for minor controversy which, coupled with some quite frank material, earned the show a somewhat risqué reputation. His later comedy series continued in the same vein and included sketches showing the Pope (played by Allen) and his Cardinals doing a striptease on the steps of St Peter's; aggressive priests beating up their parishioners and other priests; priests who spoke like Daleks though electronic confessionals; and an extremely excitable Pope who spoke in a Chico Marx type accent as he ordered Allen to \"getta your bum outta Rome!\"\n\nThe \"Father Ted\" series, broadcast on UK television 1993–98, follows the exploits of three Roman Catholic priests who preside over a parish on Craggy Island off the Irish coast. The reasons for their exile, which are hinted at across several episodes, appear to stem from a mixture of incompetence and embarrassing conduct: Father Dougal McGuire due to his stupidity and incompetence (with particular regard to the \"Blackrock Incident\", which is never further elaborated on, although Bishop Brennan mentions \"the strings I had to pull to stop the Vatican getting involved\"); Father Jack because of his alcoholism and implied womanising, which caused severe embarrassment to the Catholic Church (a \"wedding in Athlone\" is mentioned); and Father Ted Crilly for alleged financial impropriety. Ted insists he was innocent, regularly claiming that \"the money was just resting in my account\", and that it was \"a perfectly legitimate monetary transfer\". The senile Father Jack is notorious for the economy of expression and intent revealed in his catchphrase \"Drink! Feck! Arse! Girls!\" Their superior Bishop Brennan also has skeletons in his closet. In one episode it is revealed that he has a mistress and a son. This satirical shaft seems to refer to the real-life scandal surrounding Eamon Casey, former Bishop of Galway, whose domestic circumstances were similar to Bishop Brennan's.\n\nThe Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights condemned the Bloody Mary episode of South Park for its treatment of the Virgin Mary. They demanded an apology to Roman Catholics and that the episode \"be permanently retired and not be made available on DVD.\" In particular, they also demanded that Joseph A. Califano, Jr., a member of Viacom's (the parent of Comedy Central) board of directors and a practicing Catholic, issue his own statement of condemnation. Califano did later release a statement calling the episode an \"appalling and disgusting portrayal of the Virgin Mary\", and pledged to have it reviewed by Viacom's president and CEO, Tom Freston. Bishop William Skylstad, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, sent a letter to Freston saying the network showed \"extreme insensitivity\" when it aired the episode. When Comedy Central re-aired all the episodes from South Park's Fall 2005 season on December 28, 2005, \"Bloody Mary\" was noticeably absent from the broadcast. Comedy Central responded to e-mail inquiries about the fate of the episode with the assurance that \"Bloody Mary\" has not been retired and would not be pulled from the DVD release. However, screen captures from the episode are still missing on Comedy Central's press site and the South Park section of comedycentral.com.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with \"Nightline\", South Park co-creator Matt Stone said when asked if he felt more sympathy (if any) for Catholics (for \"Bloody Mary\") or Scientologists (for the episode Trapped in the Closet, another Season 9 episode regarding religion that had been temporarily pulled from re-runs for insensitivity), he said his sympathy lay with the Catholics.\n\nLuis Buñuel who was a fierce critic of the perceived pretension and hypocrisy of the Roman Catholic Church. Many of his most famous films demonstrate this:\n\nRobbie Coltrane portrays a naive priest who is made Pope in a corrupt mafia-controlled Vatican in the comedy film \"The Pope Must Die\" (1991). The plot alludes to the Roberto Calvi scandal and the Pope John Paul I conspiracy theories. Coltrane had previously donned clerical vestments in \"Nuns on the Run\" (1990). Earlier in his career Coltrane had also created a television comedy character known as 'Mason Boyne' - a spoof Scottish Presbyterian Orangeman - who was rabidly anti-Catholic to the point of painting over the leaves on plants with orange paint.\n\nThe Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, an international group of mostly gay men who frequently mock Catholicism and promote safe sex and AIDS awareness, hold anniversary parties and parades on Easter Sunday. Their use of Catholic symbolism is considered offensive by some.\n\n"}

{"id": "1224643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1224643", "title": "Mammy archetype", "text": "Mammy archetype\n\nA mammy, also spelled mammie, is a U.S. stereotype, especially in the South, for a black woman who worked in a white family and nursed the family's children.\n\nOne of the earliest fictionalized versions of the mammy figure is Aunt Chloe in Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", which was first published in 1852. As the mammy figure progressed into the 20th century, the persona was sacrificed to the demands of the white majority, who widely mythologized the figure. Memoirs that describe the roles of mammies from the 1890s to the 1920s downplayed the mammy's relationship with her family.\n\nThe background of the mammy figure was the history of slavery in the United States. African-American female slaves were tasked with the duties of domestic workers in White American households. Their duties included preparing meals, cleaning homes, and nursing and rearing their owners' children. Out of these circumstances arose the image of the mammy.\n\nWhile originating in the slavery period, the mammy figure rose to prominence during the Reconstruction Era. In the Southern United States, the mammy played a role in historical revisionism efforts to reinterpret and legitimize their legacy of chattel slavery and racial oppression. The mammy image endured there to the 20th century. In 1923, the United Daughters of the Confederacy proposed the erection of a mammy statue on the National Mall. The proposed statue would be dedicated to \"The Black Mammy of the South\".\n\nThe historicity of the mammy figure is questionable. Historical accounts point to the identity of most female domestic servants as teenagers and young adults, not \"grandmotherly types\" such as the mammy. Melissa Harris-Perry has argued that the mammy was a creation of the imagination of the White supremacy, which reimagined the powerless, coerced slave girls as soothing, comfortable, and consenting women. In 1981, Andy Warhol included the mammy in his Myths series, alongside other mythological and folklore characters such as Santa Claus, Mickey Mouse, and Superman.\n\nIn \"Mammy. A Century of Race, Gender, and Southern Memory\" (2008), Kimberly Wallace-Sanders argued that the mammy's stereotypical attributes point to the source of her inspiration: \"a long lasting and troubled marriage of racial and gender essentialism, mythology, and southern nostalgia.\n\nThe romanticized mammy image survives in the popular imagination of the modern United States. Chanequa Walker-Barnes, a licensed psychologist, argues that political correctness has led to the mammy figure being less prevalent in the 21st century culture, but the mammy archetype still influences the portrayal of African-American women in fiction, as good caretakers, nurturing, selfless, strong, and supportive, the supporting characters to white protagonists. She cites as examples Miranda Bailey, Mercedes Jones, and Ivy Wentz.\n\nThe mammy was usually portrayed as an older woman, overweight, and dark skinned. She was an idealized figure of a caregiver: amiable, loyal, maternal, non-threatening, obedient, and submissive. The mammy figure demonstrated deference to white authority. On occasion, the mammy was also depicted as a sassy woman. She was devoted to her owners/employers and her primary goal in life was to care for their needs. Some portrayals had the mammy have a family of her own. But her caregiving duties would always come first, leading to the mammy being portrayed as a neglectful parent or grandparent. And while the mammy was devoted to her white family, she often treated her own family poorly. Moreover, she had no black friends. \n\n\"Sister Citizen: Shame, Stereotypes, and Black Women in America\" (2011) by Melissa Harris-Perry describes the relationship between the mammy and other African Americans: \"Mammy was not a protector or defender of black children or communities. She represented a maternal ideal, but not in caring for her own children. Her love, doting, advice, correction, and supervision were reserved exclusively for white women and children.\" \n\nThe mammy was contrasted with the Jezebel stereotype which depicted younger African-American women as conniving and promiscuous. The mammy was occasionally depicted as a religious woman. More often than not, the mammy was an asexual figure, \"devoid of any personal desires that might tempt her to sin\". This helped the mammy serve as both a confidant and a moral guide to her young charges, capable of keeping them in line.\n\n\"Mammy. A Century of Race, Gender, and Southern Memory\" (2008) by Kimberly Wallace-Sanders includes other characteristics of the mammy. A large dark body, a round smiling face, a deeply sonorous and effortlessly soothing voice, a raucous laugh. Her personal attributes include infinite patience, self-deprecating wit, an implicit understanding and acceptance of her own inferiority, and her devotion to whites. The mammy was also large-breasted, desexualized, and potentially hostile towards men. Many of these characteristics were denied to African-American female slaves but were generally attributed to the mammy.\n\nThe dress often reflected the status of her owner. The mammy was usually neat and clean and wore attire that was suitable for her domestic duties. Sometimes a mammy considered herself to be dressed up, but that was usually just an addition of a bonnet and a silk velvet mantle, which probably belonged to her mistress.\n\nLike most of the slaves at that time, the mammy was often illiterate though intelligent in her own sense. Among many of the slaves, there could have been a mammy who possessed the abilities to read and write, often taught to her by the children of the family for whom she worked. However, as intelligent as she might have been, most of her intelligence was a result of past experiences and conflicts. In particular, a mammy of an aristocratic family could be identified by her air of refinement.\n\nWhen the mammy did not stay in the house of her master or was not busy attending to the needs of the master's children, she would usually live with her husband and children in a cabin that was distinguished from the cabins of the other slaves in either size or structure. Her cabin stood near the master's house but at a distance from the cabins of the other slaves.\n\nAlthough the duties were far less tiring and strenuous than those of the other slaves, her hours were often long, leaving little time for her own leisure. It was not until the mammy had become too old for these duties that she would enjoy any home life of her own, since she was always preoccupied with the home life of her master. There was a flexibility about the mammy's duties that distinguished her from just being an ordinary nurse or a wet nurse, even though there was a possibility that she could perform either of these tasks. In some of the more wealthy households, the mammy had assistants that would help her take care of the household's children. These women were often much younger than the mammy herself.\n\nThe mammy, unlike the other slaves, was usually not up for sale, and the children of the mammy would be kept in the same family for as long as possible, retaining the same relationships that the mammy had with the master.\n\nThe role of the mammy in plantation households grew out of the roles of African-American slaves on the plantation. African-American slaves played vital roles in the plantation household. The majority of these duties generally were related to caring for the children of the family, thus relieving the mistress of the house of all the drudgery work that is associated with child care. When the children had grown up and were able to take care of themselves properly, the mammy's main role was to help the mistress with household tasks. As her years of service with the family increased, the mammy's sphere of influence increased as well. She was next to the mistress in authority and had the ability to give orders to everybody in the house.\n\nThe mammy was often considered to be part of the family as much as its blood members were considered. Although she was considered of a lower status, she was still included in the inner circle. She has often been referred to as a \"unique type of foster motherhood\". Aside from just tending to the needs of the children, the mammy was also responsible for teaching the proper etiquette to them, such as addressing the elders on the plantation as \"aunt\" or \"uncle\", as well as what was best to say on a particular occasion and what was not. The mammy was able to discipline her charges whenever they performed something undesirable and was able to retain their respect towards her, even after the children had grown to adults.\n\nLike the image of Aunt Jemima, the image of the mammy was given a contemporary makeover as well as she appeared in television sitcoms. Some of the more contemporary features that the mammy received were that her head rag was removed and she became smaller, as well as lighter in complexion. In addition, her owner was not always white.\n\nSome contemporary television sitcoms which featured mammies include \"Maude\", where the character Florida, played by Esther Rolle, worked as a domestic for a white family. A spin-off titled \"Good Times\" was made, where Rolle's character became the center of the series; the show focused on her family, which lived generally happy lives in a low-income housing project. Other television series that featured mammies as characters include \"That's My Mama\", \"Gimme a Break!\" and \"What's Happening!!\".\n\nWhen other contemporary mammies emerged, they usually retained their occupation as a domestic and exhibited these physical feature changes; however, their emotional qualities remained intact. These contemporary mammies continued to be quick-witted and remained highly opinionated. A new twist in the outlook of the contemporary mammy occurred in the sitcom \"The Jeffersons\", where Florence, a maid played by Marla Gibbs, worked for an affluent African-American family.\n\nOne of the more recent caricatures that still exist in today's society is Tyler Perry's Madea character. Madea is a massive heavyset black woman who is known for her violent acts throughout the Perry films. She contributes the stereotypes about African-American women being bitter, mean, and violent towards everyday people. Perry also has another character that contributes to the stereotypes among the African-American community which is the \"Crack Mother\" caricature. He received a lot of backlash for regenerating this myth of black mothers. In the sitcom \"The House of Paynes\" there is a crack mother character who cannot provide for her children and she undergoes the stereotypical detoxification.\n\nAdditionally, mammy characters were a staple of minstrel show, giving rise to many sentimental show tunes dedicated to or mentioning mammies, including Al Jolson's \"My Mammy\" from \"The Jazz Singer\" and Judy Garland's performance of \"Swanee\" from \"A Star is Born\" (a song originally made popular by Jolson). Various mammy characters appeared in radio and TV shows. One prominent example was the radio and later short-lived television series \"Beulah\", which featured a black maid named Beulah who helped solve a white family's problems. In the 1940s and early 1950s, Mammy Two Shoes, the housekeeper in the Tom and Jerry shorts, presented an animated example of the mammy, complete with dark skin and a black accent. As a parody of this stereotype, the 1984 Frank Zappa album \"Thing-Fish\" featured characters called \"mammy nuns\".\n\nIn the early 20th century, the mammy character was common in many films. Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar for her performance as \"Mammy\" in \"Gone with the Wind\" in 1939. Common roles in American mass media seeming to be reserved for the mammy stereotype include secretaries, hospital/medical practice assistants and greasy spoon diner waitresses.\n\nThe mammy character is used in many films, novels, television shows and video games, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

While originally part of the Pequot people, it gradually became independent and allied with English colonists in the Pequot War of 1637. This broke the power in the region of the Pequot who were formerly the dominant tribe. In reward, the English gave Western Pequot taken as captives to the Mohegan.\n\nIn 1933 John E. Hamilton, also known as Chief Rolling Cloud, was appointed Grand Sachem for Life of the Mohegan by his mother, Alice Storey. The Mohegan had a matrilineal kinship system, and male leaders were chosen by women elders from families with hereditary claims to the position. Storey was a direct descendant of Uncas, the great 17th-century leader of the Mohegan Nation, and of Tamaquashad, Grand Sachem of the Pequot Nation. In Mohegan tradition, the position of tribal leadership called Grand Sachem had always been hereditary through the maternal line.\n\nGladys Tantaquidgeon, who died at the age of 106 in 2005, served for years as the Tribe's medicine woman and unofficial historian. She became an anthropologist and worked for a decade with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. Returning to Connecticut, she operated her family's tribal Tantaquidgeon Museum for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947. It was one of the first museums to be owned and operated by Native Americans.\n\nJohn Hamilton was a key figure among Native American leaders initiating late twentieth century land claims suits. Tribes in the Northeast had long interaction with European Americans. There was continued encroachment of their lands, even when colonial-era reservations were established. By the early 20th century, many of the tribes in the Northeast were essentially landless.\n\nIn the period of mid- and late-20th century increased Native American activism, the Mohegan and other Northeast tribes filed federal land claims suits seeking to recover land or compensation for what they had lost. The courts ruled in their favor, in cases in which states had conducted illegal arrangements with tribal leaders, without gaining US Senate approval. Congress passed bills to ratify these settlements, which often involved compensation for lands lost, or land set aside for the tribes, and sometimes compensation, in addition to official federal recognition of the groups as tribes. The so-called \"state tribes\" were those along the East Coast who had been recognized by the English Crown through treaties and other documentation long before individual colonial or state governments had been established. But, as the Native people lost their traditional lands and were not assigned reservations, they did not maintain their sovereign legal status associated with federal recognition.\n\nIn the 1960s, during a period of rising activism among Native Americans, Hamilton filed a number of land claims authorized by the \"Council of Descendants of Mohegan Indians.\" The group had some 300 members at the time.\n\nIn 1970 the Montville, Connecticut faction of the Mohegan expressed its dissatisfaction with Hamilton's land-claims litigation. They wanted a change in direction. When the Hamilton supporters left a council meeting, the remainder elected Courtland Fowler as their new leader. Notes of that Council meeting referred to Hamilton as \"Sachem\".\n\nThe group led by John Hamilton worked with the attorney Jerome Griner in federal land claims through the 1970s. The Fowler faction opposed this. In addition, a Kent, Connecticut property owners' organization, with native and non-native members, opposed the Hamilton land claims and the petition for federal recognition. These people were worried that their property values might be affected. \n\nIn response to the petitions by additional tribes seeking federal recognition, in 1978 the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) established a formal administrative process and criteria to be satisfied to prove cultural continuity; they established these in consultation with federally recognized tribes. That year, as authorized by the Council of Descendants, Hamilton submitted the Mohegan Tribe's first petition for federal recognition.\n\nJohn Hamilton died in 1988. In his will, he named Eleanor Fortin as the Grand Sachem of the Mohegan people. She became the leader of the \"Hamilton group,\" which continued to contend with the \"Fowler faction\" over tribal policy. Despite their disagreements, both groups continued to participate in tribal activities and to identify as Mohegan people.\n\nBy 1989, the Fowler faction had revived Hamilton's 1978 petition for federal recognition, which had been dormant for some years. The BIA's preliminary finding was that the Mohegan had not satisfied the criteria of documenting continuity in social community, and demonstrating political authority and influence as a tribe, through the twentieth century.\n\nIn 1990, the Mohegan under Fowler submitted a detailed response to address the BIA's concerns. They included compiled genealogies and other records, some of which had been collected and preserved by Hamilton and his followers. For instance, Eleanor Fortin had allowed the MTIC (Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut) researchers access to records pertaining to the Mohegan Congregational Church in Montville. The researchers had assured Fortin that if federal recognition were achieved, it would cover the entire surviving Mohegan population. They also used records maintained by Gladys Tantaquidgeon, who had kept genealogy and vital statistics of tribal members for her anthropological research.\n\nIn 1990, the MTIC ruled the tribe's membership be restricted to documented descendants from a single family, ca. 1860. This criteria excludes some of the Hamilton followers. By law, a federally recognized tribe has the authority to determine its own rules for membership. The MTIC tried to sue other Mohegan over their use of the tribal identity as well as their crafting, but they were unsuccessful.\n\nIn its 1994 \"Final Determination,\" the BIA cited the vital statistics and genealogies as documents that were decisive in demonstrating \"that the tribe did indeed have social and political continuity during the middle of the 20th century.\" The former Fowler group gained federal recognition as the Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut (MTIC). They do not acknowledge John Hamilton as Grand Sachem in their history, but say that Harold Tantaquidgeon was their chief prior to the era of federal recognition.\n\nThat same year, Congress passed the Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act, which authorized the United States to take land into trust to establish a reservation for the Mohegan and settle their land claim. The final 1994 agreement between MTIC and the State in the settlement of land claims extinguished all pending land claims.\n\nThe Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut is the only federally recognized tribe of the Mohegan people.\n\nDescendants of the followers of John Hamilton continue to function as a Mohegan band independently of the MTIC. They hold periodic gatherings and activities.\n\nAs of 2014, there are between 1,400 and 1,700 recorded tribal members (these figures vary by source). The Mohegan language has been dormant for approximately 100 years; the last native speaker, Fidelia A.H. Fielding, died in 1908. Fielding, a descendant of Chief Uncas, is deemed the preserver of the language. She left four diaries that are being used in the 21st-century process of restoring the language. She also took part in preserving the traditional culture. She practiced a traditional Mohegan way of life and was the last person to live in the traditional log dwelling.\n\nAnother important tribal member was Gladys Tantaquidgeon, who was the tribe's medicine woman from 1916 until her death in 2005. She too assisted greatly in maintaining the Mohegan culture, as she collected thousands of tribal documents and artifacts. These documents were of critical importance to supporting the tribe's documentation for its case for federal recognition, which was approved in 1994.\n\nAs of 2010, the Shinnecock and Unkechaug nations of Long Island, New York, had begun work with the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Southampton Campus, to revive their languages, or dialects of the above. \n\nAs of 2012, the Mohegan Language Project had created lessons, a dictionary, and other online learning materials to revive their language. The project also has a complete grammar in the works, which has been put together by Stephanie Fielding. The primary goal of the project is for the next generation of Mohegan people to be fluent.\n\nMany of the dictionaries circulating are based on Prince and Speck's interpretation of testimony by the Mohegan woman, \"Dji's Butnaca\" (Flying Bird), also known as Fidelia A.H. Fielding.\n\nThe Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center collection includes a 1992 menu \"which attempts to translate such words as hamburger and hot dog into Mohegan-Pequot.\"\n\nThe language was documented as early as the 17th century.\n\n\"In 1690, a Pequot vocabulary list was compiled by Rev. James Noyes in Groton. In 1717, Experience Mayhew, a Congregational Minister translated the Lord's Prayer into Mohegan-Pequot. Ezra Stiles, president of Yale University collected Pequot linguistic data in Groton in 1762.\"\nBahá'í prayers have been translated into the Mohegan-Pequot language.\n\"It is a sacred obligation,\" says the Golden Hill Paugussett Chief, Big Eagle. \"Indian people must keep their languages alive. If the language is not spoken, it must be made to live again.\"\n\n is realized as only before .\n\nVowel Sounds\n\nThe nasal sound can range to being an oral sound.\n\nNouns\n\nNouns in Mohegan have two forms: animate and inanimate. They are further distinguished by number. Animate nouns include people, animals, heavenly bodies (sun, moon, stars, but not clouds), and spirits. There are other items that call fall into the category of animate such as certain cultural items and plants, but it is not known why these items are considered animate. It is something that is simply learned and memorized. One way to help identify if a noun is animate or inanimate is to look at its plural form. Plural animate nouns typically end in \"-k\" while plural inanimate nouns ends in \"-sh\".\n\nAnimate nouns have four forms: singular, plural, obviative and locative. The obviative form is used when there are two or more animate third persons in a sentence. The obviative is used when a noun or pronoun is the object of the verb (the object is the obviate), or if the third person is possessed by another person. The locative is used to show where something is spatially. Note that there is no obviative form for inanimate nouns, and neither the obviative nor the locative have plural forms (plurality is known through context).\n\nVerbs\n\nVerbs in Mohegan come in several forms. Independent verbs exist in four forms: inanimate intransitive, animate intransitive, transitive inanimate and transitive animate. There is also the conjunct form which does not carry the affixes (used to clarify person) that the aforementioned hold.\n\nPerson\n\nMohegan animate intransitive verbs show who the subject is by utilizing affixes. Singular forms have prefixes, but third person (singular and plural) only have suffixes. In the plural forms there are inclusive and exclusive suffixes; the inclusive \"we\" includes the person who is speaking as well as the person he/she is talking to whereas the exclusive \"we\" does not include the person the speaker is talking to. When an animate intransitive verb stem ends in a long vowel (\"á, i, o\" or \"ô\") the 3rd person singular does not take a final \"-w\", and in the 3rd person plural these same verbs take \"-k\" as an ending in lieu of \"- wak\".\n\nNumbers\n\nLocative case\n\nThe locative case is used to show where something is. Mohegan utilizes the suffix \"-uk\" to indicate spatial relationships, which can be compared to the English prepositions \"on,\" \"at,\" and \"in.\" In Mohegan there is no plural form to go with the obviative and the locative: the same form is used for singular and plural with the difference being distinguished by context.\n\nExample of the Locative Case\nAbsentative case\n\nThe absentative case is used to when referencing a person who has died (this includes any property that they left behind). This is accomplished by adding a suffix to either his/her name, title or the property.\n\nThe following example shows the absentative case in use:\n\nNiswi \"nusihsuk\" wikôtamak áposuhutut.\n\nBoth of \"my late uncles\" enjoyed cooking.\n\nPossession\n\nIn Mohegan any noun can be possessed, however, there is a distinction in possessive relationships and that is the alienability distinction. Some nouns are able to stand alone without showing possession (alienable), while others must show a possessor (inalienable).\n\nNouns pertaining to kinship and body parts are always classified as inalienable, but there are some terms that don't fall under either of these umbrellas that must be classified as inalienable such as the noun \"home.\" Various affixes are used to denote inalienability and different affixes are used to differentiate animate/inanimate and singular/plural. Additionally, when a term requires possession but the possessor is unclear or unknown it is marked with prefix that indicates an indefinite possessor.\n\nThe locative (\"-uk\") and obviate (\"-ah\") suffixes are added to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person singular forms. Whether the word is singular or plural should be suggested in the content of the sentence. The obviate affixes only go on animate nouns.\n\nWhen a possessed noun is plural it must be shown. With an animate noun then suffix \"-ak\" is combined with the possessive ending (with the exception of third person singular and third person plural, where the plural is the same as the singular).\n\nClause Combining\n\nIn Mohegan grammar verbs that are in a dependent clause are said to be in the conjunct order. Conjunct verbs have the same numbers of persons for each verb, but they do not have prefixes, only suffixes. In turn, all of the person information is at the end of the word.\n\nExample: Mô yáyuw maci \"ákacuyǒn\".\n\nTranslation: It was so bad \"that I am ashamed\".\n\nWhen in the conjunct form if the first vowel of the word is a short vowel, that is /a/ or /u/, it changes to a long /á/.\n\nTransitive verbs with inanimate objects take only a suffix as well. The suffix vary based on the ending of the stem.\n\nFor stems that end in -m- or -n- the suffixes are as follows:\n\n1st person singular: -ôn\n\n2nd person singular: -an\n\n3rd person singular: -k\n\n1st person plural: -ak\n\n2nd person plural: -áq\n\n3rd person plural: -hutut\n\n3rd person plural participle: -kik\n\nIndefinite subject (passive): -uk\n\nFor stems that end in -o- the suffixes are as follows:\n\n1st person singular: -yôn\n\n2nd person singular: -yan\n\n3rd person singular: -ôk\n\n1st person plural: -yak\n\n2nd person plural: -yáq\n\n3rd person plural: -w'hutut\n\n3rd person plural participle: -ôkik\n\nIndefinite subject (passive): -muk\n\nFor stems that end in -u- the suffixes are as follows:\n\n1st person singular: -wôn\n\n2nd person singular: -wan\n\n3rd person singular: -k\n\n1st person plural: -wak\n\n2nd person plural: -wáq\n\n3rd person plural: -'hutut\n\n3rd person plural participle: -kik\n\nIndefinite subject (passive): -muk\n\n\n\n\n"}

A motif may be repeated in a pattern or design, often many times, or may just occur once in a work.\n\nA motif may be an element in the iconography of a particular subject or type of subject that is seen in other works, or may form the main subject, as the Master of Animals motif in ancient art typically does. The related motif of confronted animals is often seen alone, but may also be repeated, for example in Byzantine silk and other ancient textiles. Where the main subject of an artistic work such as a painting is a specific person, group, or moment in a narrative, that should be referred to as the \"subject\" of the work, not a motif, though the same thing may be a \"motif\" when part of another subject, or part of a work of decorative art such as a painting on a vase.\n\nOrnamental or decorative art can usually be analysed into a number of different elements, which can be called motifs. These may often, as in textile art, be repeated many times in a pattern. Important examples in Western art include acanthus, egg and dart, and various types of scrollwork.\n\nMany designs in Islamic culture are motifs, including those of the sun, moon, animals such as horses and lions, flowers, and landscapes. Motifs can have emotional effects and be used for propaganda. In kilim flatwoven carpets, motifs such as the hands-on-hips elibelinde are woven in to the design to express the hopes and concerns of the weavers: the elibelinde symbolises the female principle and fertility, including the desire for children.\nPennsylvania Dutch hex signs are a familiar type of motif in the eastern portions of the United States. Their circular and symmetric design, and their use of brightly colored patterns from nature, such as stars, compass roses, doves, hearts, tulips, leaves, and feathers have made them quite popular. In some parts of Pennsylvania Dutch country, it is common to see these designs decorating barns and covered bridges.\n\nThe idea of a motif has become used more broadly in discussing literature and other narrative arts for an element in the story that represents a theme.\n\nGeometric, typically repeated: Meander, palmette, rosette, gul in Oriental rugs, acanthus, egg and dart, Bead and reel, Pakudos, Sauwastika, Adinkra symbols.\n\nFigurative: Master of Animals, confronted animals, velificatio, Death and the Maiden, Three hares, Sheela na gig.\n\n\n\n"}

Neil published a book of poems in 1905 called \"Blaṫa Fraoiċ\" ('Heather Blossoms'). Neil's poems and songs became well known throughout Ireland. Some titles include: \"The Hills of Donegal\", \"Noreen Bawn\" (1910), \"The Castle of Doe\", \"Marble Hill\" and \"Mo Chró Beag ag Bun Chnoc a' Tighe\" (\"My wee shack below Crockatee\") \n\nOn the evening of March 11, 1905, returning home from the Dunfanaghy Fair, Neil was stopped by a 'bobby', who fined him one shilling for having 'illegible' (Irish) writing on the signage of his donkey cart. Neil was a farmer by trade and all business carts were required to display its owner's name in English. The sign on Neil's cart defiantly read, \"\"N. MAC GIOLLA ḂRIĠDE FIOḊ-MÓR\"\". The sign was printed by Neil's friend and poet, Andrew Mac Intyre. Neil refused to pay the fine and defended himself at the Dunfanaghy Petty Session. He lost, and was penalized an additional shilling after still refusing to pay.\n\nThe Conradh na Gaeilge (\"Gaelic League\") learned of Neil's story and made efforts to help him. One of its members, attorney Patrick Pearse, seeing the opportunity to champion Irish independence, agreed to defend McBride, pro bono. McBride's appeal was brought before the Court of King's Bench in Dublin. It was Pearse's first and only court appearance as a barrister. The case was lost, but it inspired Pearse in his endeavors as a political activist and spawned a national campaign to change British government policies towards the Irish language. Pearse wrote about the court's decision in his June 27, 1905 column in the Gaelic League newspaper, \"An Claidheamh Soluis\": \"...it was in effect decided that Irish is a foreign language on the same level with Yiddish.\" Continuing in the article, Pearse urges the people of Ireland to promote the Irish Language as a form of Irish nationalism.\n\n\n\n\n"}

These Acts were products of the same impulses which drove the Beveridge Report and the creation of the Welfare State in Britain after the second world war. The NRJ documents the remarkable results of the investments made under the provisions of the Acts in Northern Rhodesia, which added enhanced educational, health and agricultural development services to the settled peace and impartial rule of law that the Colonial Service provided and which was a fundamental reason for the popular support documented by historians among the African populations. It was the loss of that impartiality which was most bitterly regretted after independence, especially in Barotseland, which became the Western Province of Zambia, and which felt itself to be systematically discriminated against by the independent government. The resentment still smoulders.\n\nThe current retreat from ideological 'development', not least because of the evidence of unintended bad consequences of 'development' aid, and the rediscovery of the importance of practical, grass-roots, value for money help, makes the case-evidence of contemporary journals like the NRJ especially valuable sources for organisations like Oxfam or the Dept for International Development.\n\nCopies of the original Journal may be found for sale from time to time on Amazon and Abe Books etc.\n"}

{"id": "19779851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19779851", "title": "Paleoart", "text": "Paleoart\n\nPaleoart (also spelled palaeoart, paleo-art, or paleo art) is any original artistic work that attempts to reconstruct or depict prehistoric life according to the current knowledge and scientific evidence at the time of the artwork's creation. The term \"paleoart\", which is a portmanteau of \"art\" and the ancient Greek word for \"old\", was introduced in the late 1980s by Mark Hallett for art that depicts subjects related to paleontology, but is considered to have originated as a visual tradition in early 1800s England. Works of paleoart may be representations of fossil remains or depictions of the living creatures and their ecosystems. While paleoart is typically defined as being scientifically informed, it is also recognized as important in influencing depictions of prehistoric animals in popular culture media, which in turn influences public perception of, and fuels interest in, these animals.\n\nA chief driver in the inception of paleoart as a distinct form of scientific illustration was the desire of both the public and of paleontologists to visualize the prehistory that fossils represented. Mark Hallett, who coined the term \"paleoart\" in 1987, stressed the importance of the cooperative effort between artists, paleontologists and other specialists in gaining access to information for generating accurate, realistic restorations of extinct animals and their environments.\n\nSince paleontological knowledge and public perception of the field have changed dramatically since the earliest attempts at reconstructing prehistory, paleoart as a discipline has consequently changed over time as well. This has led to difficulties in creating a shared definition of the term. Given that the drive towards scientific accuracy has always been a salient feature of the discipline, some authors point out the importance of separating true paleoart from \"paleoimagery\", which includes a variety of cultural and media depictions of prehistoric life in various manifestations. One attempt to separate these terms has defined paleoartists as artists who \"create original skeletal reconstructions and/or restorations of prehistoric animals, or restore fossil flora or invertebrates using acceptable and recognized procedures.\" Others have pointed out that a definition of paleoart must include a degree of subjectivity, where an artist's style, preferences and opinions come into play along with the goal of accuracy. The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology has offered the definition of paleoart as \"the scientific or naturalistic rendering of paleontological subject matter pertaining to vertebrate fossils\", a definition considered unacceptable by some for its exclusion of non-vertebrate subject matter. Paleoartist Mark Witton defines paleoart in terms of three essential elements: 1) being bound by scientific data, 2) involving biologically-informed restoration to fill in missing data, and 3) relating to extinct organisms. This definition explicitly rules out technical illustrations of fossil specimens from being considered paleoart. This definition, which requires the use of \"reasoned extrapolation and informed speculation\" to fill in these reconstructive gaps, also explicitly rules out artworks that actively go against known published data. These might be more accurately considered paleontologically-inspired art.\n\nIn an attempt to establish a common definition of the term, Ansón & colleagues (2015) conducted an empirical survey of the international paleontological community with a questionnaire on various aspects of paleoart. 78% of the surveyed participants stated agreement with the importance of scientific accuracy in paleoart, although 87% of respondents recognized an increase in accuracy of paleoart over time.\n\nThe production of paleoart requires by definition a substantial amount of research and reference-gathering to ensure scientific credibility at the time of production. The artist James Gurney, known for the Dinotopia series of fiction books, has described this interaction between scientists and artists as the artist being the eyes of the scientist, since his illustrations bring shape to the theories; paleoart determines how the public perceives long extinct animals.\n\nAlthough every artist's process will differ, Witton (2018) recommends a standard set of requirements to produce artwork that fits the definition. A basic understanding of the subject organism's place in time (geochronology) and space (paleobiogeography) is necessary for restorations of scenes or environments in paleoart. Skeletal reference—not just the bones of vertebrate animals, but including any fossilized structures that support soft tissue, such as lignified plant tissue and coral framework—is crucial for understanding the proportions, size and appearance of extinct organisms. Given that many fossil specimens are known from fragmentary material, an understanding of the organisms' ontogeny, functional morphology, and phylogeny may be required to create scientifically-rigorous paleoart by filling in restorative gaps parsimoniously.\n\nThe success of a piece of paleoart depends on its strength of composition as much as any other genre of artistry. Command of object placement, color, lighting, and shape can be indispensable to communicating a realistic depiction of prehistoric life. Paleoart is unique in its compositional challenge in that its content must be imagined and inferred, as opposed to directly referenced, in many cases, including depictions of animal behavior and environmental topography. To this end, artists must keep in mind the mood and purpose of a composition in creating an effect piece of paleoart.\n\nWhile the word \"paleoart\" is relatively recent, the practice of restoring ancient life based on real fossil remains can be considered to have originated around the same time as paleontology. However, art of extinct animals has existed long before Henry De la Beche's 1830 painting \"Duria Antiquior\", which is often credited as the first true paleontological artwork. These older works include sketches, paintings and detailed anatomical restorations, though the relation of these works to observed fossil material is mostly speculative. For example, a Corinthian vase painted sometime between 560 and 540 BCE is thought by some researchers to bear a depiction of an observed fossil skull. This so-called \"Monster of Troy\", the beast fought by the mythological Greek hero Heracles, somewhat resembles the skull of the giraffid \"Samotherium\". Witton considered that because the painting has significant differences from the skull it is supposedly representing (lack of horns, sharp teeth) the evidence is lacking that it represents \"proto-paleoart\". Other scholars have suggested that ancient fossils inspired Grecian depictions of griffins, with the mythical chimera of lion and bird anatomy superficially resembling the beak, horns and quadrupedal body plan and fossil of the dinosaur \"Protoceratops\". Similarly, authors have speculated that the huge, unified nasal opening in the skull of fossil mammoths could have inspired ancient artwork and stories of the one-eyed cyclops. However, these ideas have never been substantiated by evidence that isn't more parsimoniously explained by established cultural interpretations of these mythical figures.\nThe earliest definitive works of \"proto-paleoart\" that unambiguously depict the life appearance of fossil animals come from fifteenth and sixteenth century Europe. One such depiction is Ulrich Vogelsang's statue of a Lindwurm in Klagenfurt, Austria, that dates to 1590. Writings from the time of its creation specifically identify the skull of \"Coelodonta antiquitatis\", the woolly rhinoceros, as the basis for the head in the restoration. This skull had been found in a mine or gravel pit near Klagenfurt in 1335, and remains on display today. Despite its poor resemblance of the skull in question, the Lindwurm statue was thought to be almost certainly inspired by the find.\n\nThe German textbook \"Mundus Subterraneus\", authored by scholar Athanasius Kircher in 1678, features a number of illustrations of giant humans and dragons that may have been informed by fossil finds of the day, many of which came from quarries and caves. Some of these may have been the bones of large Pleistocene mammals common to these European caves. Others may have been based on far older fossils of plesiosaurs, which are thought to have informed a unique depiction of a dragon in this book that departs noticeably from the classically slender, serpentine dragon artwork of the era by having a barrel-like body and 'paddle-like' wings. According to some researchers, this dramatic departure from the typical dragon artwork of this time, which is thought to have been informed by the Lindwurm, likely reflects the arrival of a new source of information, such as a speculated discovery of plesiosaur fossils in quarries of the historic Swabia region of Bavaria.\n\nEighteenth century skeletal reconstructions of another mythical creature, the unicorn, are thought to have been inspired by Ice Age mammoth and rhinoceros bones found in a cave near Quedlinburg, Germany, in 1663. These artworks are of uncertain origin and may have been created by Otto von Guericke, the German naturalist who first described the \"unicorn\" remains in his writings, or Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the author who published the image posthumously in 1749. This rendering represents the oldest known illustration of a fossil skeleton.\n\nThe beginning of the 19th century saw the first paleontological artworks with an unambiguous scientific basis, and this emergence coincided with paleontology being seen as a distinct field of science. The French naturalist and professor Jean Hermann of Strasbourg, France, drafted what Witton describes as the \"oldest known, incontrovertible\" pieces of paleoart in 1800. These sketches, based on the first known fossil material skeleton of a pterosaur, depict Hermann's interpretation of the animal as a flying mammal with fur and large external ears. These ink drawings were relatively quick sketches accompanying his notes on the fossil and were likely never intended for publication, and their existence was only recently uncovered from correspondence between the naturalist artist and the French anatomist Baron Georges Cuvier. \n\nSimilarly, private sketches of mammoth fossils drafted by Yakutsk merchant Roman Boltunov in 1805 were likely never intended for scientific publication, but their function—to communicate the life appearance of an animal whose tusks he had found in Siberia and was hoping to sell—nevertheless establishes it one of the first examples of paleoart by today's definition. Boltunov's sketches of the animal, which depicted it as trunkless and boar-like, raised enough scientific interest in the specimen that the drawings were later sent to St. Petersburg and eventually led to excavation and study of the rest of the specimen.\n\nCuvier, Jean Hermann's correspondent whose attention later brought his pterosaur sketches to light, went on to produce skeletal restorations of extinct mammals of his own. Some of these included restorations with musculature layered atop them, which in the early 1820s could be considered the earliest examples of illustrations of animal tissue built up over fossil skeletons. As huge and detailed fossil restorations were at this point appearing in the same publications as these modest attempts at soft tissue restoration, historians have speculated whether this reflected shame and lack of interest in paleoart as being too speculative to have scientific value at the time. One notable deviation from this approach is seen in a cartoon drawn by geologist William Conybeare in 1822. This cartoon depicts paleontologist William Buckland entering the famous British Kirkdale Cave, known for its Ice Age mammal remains, amidst a scene of fossil hyenas restored in the flesh in the ancient cave interior, the first known artwork depicting an extinct animal restored in a rendition of an ancient environment. A similar step forward depicts a dragon-like animal meant to represent the pterosaur \"Dimorphodon\", flying over a coastline, by George Howman. This 1829 watercolor painting was a fanciful piece that, albeit being not particularly scientific, was another very early attempt at restoring a fossil animal in a suitable habitat.\nIn 1830, the first \"fully realized\" paleoart scene, depicting prehistoric animals in a realistic geological setting, was painted by British paleontologist Henry De la Beche. Dubbed \"Duria Antiquior — A more Ancient Dorset\", this watercolor painting represents a scene from the Early Jurassic of Dorset, a fossil-rich region of the British Isles. This painting, based on fossil discoveries along the coast of Dorset by paleontologist Mary Anning, showcased realistic aspects of fossil animal appearance, behavior, and environment at a level of detail, realism and accuracy that was among the very first of its kind. This watercolor, an early illustration of paleoecology, shows plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs swimming and foraging in a natural setting, and includes depictions of behavior of these marine reptiles that, while unknown, were inferences made by De la Beche based on the behavior of living animals. For example, one ichthyosaur is painted with its mouth open about to swallow the fish head-first, just as a predatory fish would swallow another. Several of these animals are also depicted defecating, a theme that emerges in other works by De la Beche. For example, his 1829 lithograph called \"A Coprolitic Vision\", perhaps inspired by Conybeare's Kirkdale Cave cartoon, again pokes fun at William Buckland by placing him at the mouth of a cave surrounded by defecating prehistoric animals. Several authors have remarked on De la Beche's apparent interest in fossilized feces, speculating that even the shape of the cave in this cartoon is reminiscent of the interior of an enormous digestive tract. In any case, \"Duria Antiquior\" inspired many subsequent derivatives, one of which was produced by Nicholas Christian Hohe in 1831 titled \"Jura Formation\". This piece, published by German paleontologist Georg August Goldfuss, was the first paleoart scene to enter scientific publication, and was likely an introduction to other academics of the time to the potential of paleoart.\n\nThe role of art in disseminating paleontological knowledge took on a new salience with the introduction of the term \"dinosaur\" by Sir Richard Owen in 1842. With only fragmentary fossil remains known at the time, the question of life appearance of dinosaurs captured the interest of scientist and public alike. With Owen's help, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins created the first life-size sculptures depicting dinosaurs as he thought they may have appeared; he is considered by some to be the first significant artist to apply his skills to the field of dinosaur paleontology. Some of these models were initially created for the Great Exhibition of 1851, but 33 were eventually produced when the Crystal Palace was relocated to Sydenham, in South London. Owen famously hosted a dinner for 21 prominent men of science inside the hollow concrete \"Iguanodon\" on New Year's Eve 1853. However, in 1849, a few years before his death in 1852, Gideon Mantell had realized that \"Iguanodon\", of which he was the discoverer, was not a heavy, pachyderm-like animal, as Owen was putting forward, but had slender forelimbs; his death left him unable to participate in the creation of the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, and so Owen's vision of dinosaurs became that seen by the public. He had nearly two dozen life-sized sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel and brick framework; two \"Iguanodon\", one standing and one resting on its belly, were included. The dinosaurs remain in place in the park, but their depictions are now outdated in many respects.\n\nThe Crystal Palace models, despite their inaccuracy by today's standards, were a landmark in the advancement of paleoart as not only a serious academic undertaking, but also one that can capture the interest of the general public. The Crystal Palace dinosaur models were the first works of paleoart to be merchandised as postcards, guide books, and replicas to the general public. In the latter half of the 1800s, this major shift could be seen in other developments taking place in academic books and paintings featuring scientific restorations of prehistoric life. For example, a book by French scientist Louis Figuier titled \"La Terre Avant le Deluge\", published in 1863, was the first to feature a series of works of paleoart documenting life through time. Illustrated by French painter Édouard Riou, this book featured iconic scenes of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals based on Owen's constructions, and would establish a template for academic books featuring artworks of prehistoric life through time for years to come.\n\nAs the western frontier was further opened up in the latter half of the nineteenth century, the rapidly increasing pace of dinosaur discoveries in the bone-rich badlands of the American Midwest and the Canadian wilderness brought with it a renewed interest in artistic reconstructions of paleontological findings. This 'classic' period saw the emergence of Charles R. Knight, Rudolph Zallinger, and Zdeněk Burian as the three most prominent exponents of paleoart. During this time, dinosaurs were popularly reconstructed as tail-dragging, cold-blooded, sluggish \"Great Reptiles\" that became a byword for evolutionary failure in the minds of the public.\nCharles Knight is generally considered one of the key figures in paleoart during this time. His birth three years after Charles Darwin's publication of the influential \"Descent of Man\", along with the \"Bone Wars\" between rival American paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Marsh raging during his childhood, had poised Knight for rich early experiences in developing an interest in reconstructing prehistoric animals. As an avid wildlife artist who disdained drawing from mounts or photographs, instead preferring to draw from life, Knight grew up drawing living animals, but turned toward prehistoric animals against the backdrop of rapidly-expanding paleontological discoveries and the public energy that accompanied the sensationalist coverage of these discoveries around the turn of the 20th century. Knight's foray into paleoart can be traced to a commission ordered by Dr. Jacob Wortman of a painting of a prehistoric pig, \"Elotherium\", to accompany its fossil display at the American Museum of Natural History. Knight, who had always preferred to draw animals from life, applied his knowledge of modern pig anatomy to the painting, which so thrilled Wortman that the museum then commissioned Knight to paint a series of watercolors of various fossils on display.\n\nThroughout the 1920s, '30s and '40s, Knight went on produce drawings, paintings and murals of dinosaurs, early man, and extinct mammals for the American Museum of Natural History, where he was mentored by Henry Fairfield Osborn, and Chicago's Field Museum, as well as for \"National Geographic\" and many other major magazines of the time, culminating in his last major mural for the Everhart Museum of Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1951. Biologist Stephen Jay Gould later remarked on the depth and breadth of influence that Knight's paleoart had on shaping public perception of extinct animals, even without having published original research in the field. Gould, who was a prominent fan and popularizer of Knight's works, used one of Knight's paintings for the cover of his 1991 book \"Bully for Brontosaurus\" and another in his 1996 book \"Dinosaur in a Haystack\". Gould described Knight's contribution to scientific understanding in his 1989 book \"Wonderful Life\": \"Not since the Lord himself showed his stuff to Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones had anyone shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, the most celebrated of artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day\". One of Knight's most famous pieces was his \"Leaping Laelaps\", which he produced for the American Museum of Natural History in 1897. This painting was one of the few works of paleoart produced before 1960 to depict dinosaurs as active, fast-moving creatures, heralding the next era of paleontological artworks informed by the Dinosaur Renaissance.\nKnight's illustrations also had a large and long-lasting influence on the depiction of prehistoric animals in popular culture. The earliest depictions of dinosaurs in movies, such as the 1933 \"King Kong\" film and the 1925 production of \"The Lost World\", based on the Arthur Conan Doyle novel of the same name, relied heavily on Knight's dinosaur paintings to produce suitable dinosaur models that were realistic for the time. The special effects artist Ray Harryhausen would continue basing his movie dinosaurs on Knight illustrations up through the sixties, including for films such as the 1966 \"One Million Years B.C.\" and the 1969 \"Valley of Gwangi\".\n\nRudolph Zallinger and Zdeněk Burian both went on to influence the state of dinosaur art while Knight's career began to wind down. Zallinger, who began working for the Yale Peabody Museum illustrating marine algae around the time that the United States entered World War II, began his most iconic piece of paleoart, a five-year mural project for the Yale Peabody Museum, in 1942. This mural, titled \"The Age of Reptiles\", was completed in 1947 and became representative of the modernist consensus of dinosaur biology at that time. He later completed a second great mural for the Peabody, \"The Age of Mammals\", which grew out of a painting published in \"Life\" magazine in 1953.\n\nZdeněk Burian followed the school of Knight and Zallinger, entering modern, biologically-informed paleoart scene via his extensive series of prehistoric life illustrations. Burian entered the world of prehistoric illustration in the early 1930s with illustrations for fictional books set in various prehistoric times by amateur archaeologist Eduard Štorch. These illustrations brought him to the attention of paleontologist Josef Augusta, with whom Burian worked in cooperation from 1935 until Augusta's death in 1968. This collaboration led ultimately to the launching of Burian's career in paleoart.\n\nSome authors have remarked on a darker, more sinister feel to his paleoart than that of his contemporaries, speculating that this style was informed by Burian's experience producing artwork in his native Czechoslovakia during World War II and, afterwards, under Soviet control. His depictions of suffering, death, and the harsh realities of survival that emerged as themes in his paleoart were unique at the time. Original Burian paintings are on exhibit at the Dvůr Králové Zoo, the National Museum (Prague) and at the Anthropos Museum in Brno. In 2017, the first valid Czech dinosaur was named \"Burianosaurus augustai\" in honor of both Burian and Josef Augusta.\n\nWhile Charles Knight, Rudolph Zallinger and Zdeněk Burian dominated the landscape of \"classic\" scientific paleoart in the first half of the 20th century, they were far from the only paleoartists working at this time. German landscape painter Heinrich Harder was illustrating natural history articles, including a series accompanying articles by science writer Wilhelm Bölsche on earth history for \"Die Gartenlaube\", a weekly magazine, in 1906 and 1908. He also worked with Bölsche to illustrate 60 dinosaur and other prehistoric animal collecting cards for the Reichardt Cocoa Company, titled \"Tiere der Urwelt\" (\"Animals of the Prehistoric World\"). One of Harder's contemporaries, Danish paleontologist Gerhard Heilmann, produced a large number of sketches and ink drawings related to \"Archaeopteryx\" and avian evolution, culminating in his lavishly illustrated and controversial treatise \"The Origin of Birds\", published in 1926.\n\nWhile these artists' style and their artistic mastery of beauty and composition are still lauded today, this classic depiction of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals remained the status quo until the 1960s, when a minor scientific revolution began changing the perceptions of dinosaurs as tail-dragging, sluggish animals to active, alert creatures. This reformation took place following the 1964 discovery of \"Deinonychus\" by paleontologist John Ostrom. Ostrom's description of this nearly-complete birdlike dinosaur, published in 1969, challenged the presupposition of dinosaurs as cold-blooded, slow-moving reptiles, instead finding that many of these animals were likely reminiscent of birds, not just in evolutionary history and classification but in appearance and behavior as well. This idea had been advanced before, most notably by 1800s English biologist Thomas Huxley about the link between dinosaurs, modern birds, and the then-newly discovered \"Archaeopteryx\". With the discovery and description of \"Deinonychus\", however, Ostrom had laid out the strongest evidence yet of the close link between birds and dinosaurs. The artistic reconstructions of \"Deinonychus\" by his student, Robert Bakker, remain iconic of what came to be known as the Dinosaur Renaissance.\n\nBakker's influence during this period on then-fledgling paleoartists, such as Gregory S. Paul, as well as on public consciousness brought about a paradigm shift in how dinosaurs were perceived by artist, scientist and layman alike. The science and public understanding of dinosaur biology became charged by Bakker's innovative and often controversial ideas and portrayals, including the idea that dinosaurs were in fact warm-blooded animals like mammals and birds. Bakker's drawings of \"Deinonychus\" and other dinosaurs depicted the animals leaping, running, and charging, and his novel artistic output was accompanied by his writings on paleobiology, with his influential and well-known book \"The Dinosaur Heresies\", published in 1986, now regarded as a classic. American scientist-artist Gregory Paul, working originally as Bakker's student in the 1970s, became one of the leading illustrators of prehistoric reptiles in the 1980s and has been described by some authors as the paleoartist who may \"define modern paleoart more than any other\" (Witton, p. 32). Paul is notable for his 'rigorous' approach to paleoartistic restorations, including his multi-view skeletal reconstructions, evidence-driven studies of musculature and soft tissue, and his attention to biomechanics to ensure realistic poses and gaits of his artistic subjects. The artistic innovation that Paul brought to the field of paleoart is to prioritize detail over atmosphere, leading to some criticism of his work as being 'flat' or lacking in depth, but also to imbue dinosaur depictions with a greater variety of naturalistic coloration and patterns, whereas most dinosaur coloration in artworks beforehand had been fairly drab and uniform.\n\nOstrom, Bakker and Paul changed the landscape of depictions of prehistoric animals in science and popular culture alike throughout the 1970s, '80s and '90s. Their influence affected the presentation of museum displays throughout the world and eventually found its way into popular culture, with the climax of this period perhaps best marked by the 1990 novel and 1993 film \"Jurassic Park\". Paul in particular helped set the stage for the next wave of paleoaristry, and from the 1970s to the end of the twentieth century, paleoartists working from the 'rigorous' approach included Douglas Henderson, Mark Hallett, Michael Skrepnick, William Stout, Ely Kish, Luis Rey, John Gurche, Bob Walters, and others, including an expanding body of sculpting work led by artists such as Brian Cooley, Stephen Czerkas, and Dave Thomas. Many of these artists developed unique and lucrative stylistic niches without sacrificing their rigorous approach, such as Douglas Henderson's detailed and atmospheric landscapes, and Luis Rey's brightly-colored, 'extreme' depictions. The \"Renaissance\" movement so revolutionized paleoart that even the last works of Burian, a master of the \"classic\" age, were thought to be influenced by the newfangled preference for active, dynamic, exciting depictions of dinosaurs.\n\nThis movement was working in parallel with great strides in the scientific progress of vertebrate paleontology that were occurring during this time. Precision in anatomy and artistic reconstruction was aided by an increasingly detailed and sophisticated understanding of these extinct animals through new discoveries and interpretations that pushed paleoart into more objective territory with respect to accuracy. For example, the feathered dinosaur revolution, facilitated by unprecedented discoveries in the Liaoning province of northern China in the late 1990s and early 2000s, was perhaps foreseen by artist Sarah Landry, who drew the first feathered dinosaur for Bakker's seminal \"Scientific American\" article in 1975. One of the first major shows of dinosaur art was published in 1986 by Sylvia Czerkas, along with the accompanying volume \"Dinosaurs Past and Present\".\n\nAlthough various authors are in agreement about the events that caused the beginning of the Dinosaur Renaissance, the transition to the modern age of paleoart has been more gradual, with differing attitudes about what typifies the demarcation. Gregory Paul's high-fidelity archosaur skeletal reconstructions provided a basis for ushering in the modern age of paleoart, which is perhaps best characterized by adding speculative flair to the rigorous, anatomically-conscious approach popularized by the Dinosaur Renaissance. Novel advances in paleontology, such as new feathered dinosaur discoveries and the various color studies of dinosaur integument that began around 2010, have become representative of paleoart after the turn of the millennium. Witton (2018) characterizes the modern movement with the rise of digital art, as well as the establishment of an internet community that would enabled paleoartists and enthusiasts to network, share digitized and open access scientific resources, and to build a global community that was unprecedented until the first decade of the twenty-first century. The continuum of work leading from the themes and advances that began in the Dinosaur Renaissance to the production of modern paleoart is showcased in several books that were published post-2010, such as Steve White's \"Dinosaur Art: The World's Greatest Paleoart\" (2012) and its \"sequel\", \"Dinosaur Art II: The Cutting Edge of Paleoart\" (2017).\n\nAlthough this transition was gradual, authors such have Witton have described a salient cultural phenomenon that came about largely as a consequence of this increased connectivity and access to paleoart brought by the digital age. The saturation of paleoart with established and overused heuristics, many of which had been established by paleoartists working in the height of the revolution that came before, led to an increased awareness and criticism of the repetitive and unimaginative use of ideas that were, by the first decade of the 21st century, lacking in novelty. This observation led to a movement characterized by the idea that prehistoric animals could be shown in artworks engaging in a greater range of behaviors, habitats, styles, compositions, and interpretations of life appearance than had been imagined in paleoart up to that point, but without violating the principles of anatomical and scientific rigor that had been established by the paleoart revolution that came before. These ideas were formalized in a 2012 book by paleoartists John Conway and Memo Koseman, along with paleontologist Darren Naish, called \"All Yesterdays: Unique and Speculative Views of Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Animals\". This book and its associated minor paradigm shift, commonly referred to as the \"All Yesterdays\" movement, argued that it was better to employ scientifically rigorous \"reasoned speculation\" to produce a greater range of speculative, but plausible, reconstructions of prehistoric animals. Conway et al. argued that the range of appearances and behaviors depicted in paleoart had only managed to capture a very narrow range of what's plausible, based on the limited data available, and that artistic approaches to these depictions had become \"overly steeped in tradition\" (Witton, p. 36). For example, \"All Yesterdays\" examines the small, four-winged dromaeosaur \"Microraptor\" in this context. This dinosaur, described in 2003, has been depicted by countless paleoartists as a \"strange, dragon-like feathered glider with a reptilian face\" (Conway et al., page 64). Conway's illustration of \"Microraptor\" in \"All Yesterdays\" attempts to restore the animal \"from scratch\" without influence from these popular reconstructions, instead depicting it as a naturalistic, birdlike animal perched at its nest.\n\nDespite the importance of the \"All Yesterdays\" movement in hindsight, the book itself argued that the modern conceptualization of paleoart was based on anatomically rigorous restorations that came alongside and subsequent to Paul, including those who experimented with these principles outside of archosaurs. For example, artists that pioneered anatomically rigorous reconstructions of fossil hominids, like Jay Matternes and Alfons and Adrie Kennis, as well fossil mammal paleoartist Mauricio Antón, were lauded by Conway et al. as seminal influences in the new culture of paleoart. Other modern paleoartists of the \"anatomically rigorous\" and \"All Yesterdays\" movement include Jason Brougham, Mark Hallett, Scott Hartman, Bob Nicholls, Emily Willoughby and Mark P. Witton. Other authors write in agreement that the modern paleoart movement incorporates an element of \"challenging tropes and the status quo\" and that paleoart has \"entered its experimental phase\" as of the dawn of the 21st century (Switek, 2017). \n\nA 2013 study found that older paleoart was still influential in popular culture long after new discoveries made them obsolete. This was explained as cultural inertia. In a 2014 paper, Mark Witton, Darren Naish, and John Conway outlined the historical significance of paleoart, and criticized the over-reliance on clichés and the \"culture of copying\" they saw to be problematic in the field at the time. This tendency to copy \"memes\" established and proliferated by others in the field is thought to have been a stimulus for the \"All Yesterdays\" movement of injecting originality back into paleoart.\n\nSince 1999, the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology has awarded the John J. Lanzendorf PaleoArt Prize for achievement in the field. The society says that paleoart \"is one of the most important vehicles for communicating discoveries and data among paleontologists, and is critical to promulgating vertebrate paleontology across disciplines and to lay audiences\". The SVP is also the site of the occasional/annual \"PaleoArt Poster Exhibit\", a juried poster show at the opening reception of the annual SVP meetings.\n\nPaleoart has enjoyed increasing exposure in globally recognized contests and exhibits. The Museu da Lourinhã organizes the annual International Dinosaur Illustration Contest for promoting the art of dinosaur and other fossils. In fall of 2018, the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science of Albuquerque, New Mexico, displayed a juried show of paleoart called \"Picturing the Past\". This show includes 87 works by 46 paleoartists from 15 countries, and features one of the largest and most diverse collections of prehistoric animals, settings, themes and styles. Its opening was timed to coincide with the 2018 conference of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in October, and is scheduled to run until January 2019.\n\nIn addition to contests and art exhibitions, paleoart continues to play a significant role in public understanding of paleontology in a variety of ways. In 2007, The Children's Museum of Indianapolis released a lesson plan on paleoart for children of grades 3 to 5 that uses paleoart as a way to introduce children to paleontology. Paleontological-themed merchandise has been around since at least the mid-1800s, but the popularity of anatomically-accurate and paleoart-based merchandise is relatively novel, such as Rebecca Groom's highly accurate plush toy reconstructions of extinct animals.\n\n2D artists\n\n3D artists\n\n2D artists\n\n3D artists\n\n\n"}

It is currently on display along with other preserved royal items at the Wawel Royal Castle Museum in Kraków.\n\nSeveral royal crowns were made, including several during the 16th Century, a \"Hungarian Crown\", a \"Swedish Crown\" used by the Vasa kings, and others that were subsequently lost or destroyed. The crown regalia used by the Saxon kings, and some remainders of older Polish monarchs which were appropriated by king Augustus II, also the Elector of Saxony; like a cup of Queen Jadwiga so-called \"roztruchan\", and the magnificent scale armour, so-called \"karacena\", of King John III Sobieski are today on display in the Grünes Gewölbe and the Rüstkammer in Dresden, Germany.\n\nIn AD 1000, during his pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint Adalbert in Gniezno, the capital of Poland until about 1040, Emperor Otto III officially recognized Duke Bolesław I the Brave as King of Poland (see Congress of Gniezno), crowning him and presenting him with a replica of the Holy Lance, also known as Saint Maurice's Spear. This relic, together with the \"vexillum\" attached to it, was probably the first insignia of the nascent Kingdom of Poland, a symbol of King Bolesław's rule, and of his allegiance to the Emperor. It remains unknown what images, if any, were painted or embroidered on the \"vexillum\".\n\nStarting from 1320 the regalia of the Polish kings were kept in the treasury of the Wawel Cathedral. In 1370 Louis I of Hungary decided to transfer the Polish regalia to Hungary and they were returned in 1412 to Andrzej of Rożnów embassy by Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg. During the reign of the Jagiellons the regalia were moved from the cathedral to the Wawel Castle and placed in the specially prepared Crown Treasury. In the 17th century they were repeatedly brought to Warsaw for the coronations of the Polish Queens. During the Deluge in 1655, the royal insignia were evacuated from the castle by Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, Grand Marshal of the Crown and hidden in the old castle in Stará Ľubovňa. They were stored there until 1661. In 1703 during the Great Northern War they were hidden again, first in Silesia, then in Moravia. During the double election of 1733, the regalia were stolen by the follower of Stanisław I Leszczyński, Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoliński, Grand Treasurer of the Crown, who concealed them in the Holy Cross Church in Warsaw. In 1734, however, they were recovered from the hideout and deposited in the Jasna Góra Monastery, where they remained till 1736. In 1764, with the consent of the Sejm, the royal insignia were transported to Warsaw for the coronation of King Stanisław II August. Later returned to the Wawel Castle, where they were kept till the Third Partition of Poland in 1795.\n\nOn 15 June 1794 the Prussian Army entered Kraków and captured Wawel Castle, subsequently turning it into a fortress. Shortly thereafter, the city commandant, general Leopold von Reuts began a correspondence with Berlin on the fate of furnishings of the Polish kings' residence. In the greatest secrecy, by order of king Frederick William II of Prussia, he was commanded to transfer the content of the Crown Treasury to the Secret Councillor Anton Ludwig von Hoym, who was to secure its transport via Silesia to Berlin. The locksmith brought by the Prussians broke the locks of the treasury and then opened all the boxes. The valuables were transported in 1794 and found their place in the collection of the Hohenzollerns in Berlin.\n\nIn 1800 the valuables were stored in the Berlin City Palace, where they were admired by Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, as he informed Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz. In 1809 the Polish regalia were valued at 525,259 thalers and shortly after, on 17 March 1809, in accordance with the decision of Frederick William III of Prussia, all of them were melted down. The obtained gold was reused to make coins, while precious stones and pearls were handed to the Directorate of Maritime Trade in Berlin.\n\nAccording to an inventory of the State Treasury at the Wawel performed in 1633 by the Jerzy Ossoliński, Great Crown Chancellor the \"Crown Regalia\" of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (kept in five chests) consisted of:\n\nAlso a private treasury of the Vasas (kept at the Royal Castle in Warsaw) consisted of:\n\nIn 1697 a Freiburg goldsmith Johann Friedrich Klemm executed a replacement for the regalia, known as the Crown of Augustus II the Strong and intended for his coronation as a King of Poland. It was never used however, because two monks broke into the State Treasury in the Wawel Castle and stole the original regalia. The Augustus II Crown is kept in the Dresden Armory.\n\nAll of the original crown regalia were looted by the Prussians (except for the \"Muscovy Crown\") in 1795 after the Third Partition of the Commonwealth and destroyed on the order of Frederick William III of Prussia in March 1809 (except for the Szczerbiec).\n\nIn 1925 Polish Government purchased the silver regalia of King Augustus III and Queen Maria Josepha in Vienna for $35,000 (175,000 zł). It consisted of two crowns, two sceptres and two orbs made in about 1733. The original \"Crown Regalia\" were hidden by Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoliński during the War of the Polish Succession. The jewels were exhibited in Warsaw until 1939 and in 1940 they were stolen by German forces. Later they were found by the Soviet troops in Germany and sent to the USSR where they remained until 1960, when they were returned to Poland. Today they are deposited in the National Museum in Warsaw.\n\n\n\n"}

It has been displayed at Nostell Priory since 1766, and was acquired by the National Trust in 2002. The National Trust claims that it is \"the first known painting of a scene from Shakespeare\".\n\nThe painting is a rich and vibrant example of Hogarth's work, painted c.1730-5 as a special project for one of his devoted band of patrons—The Earl of Macclesfield—as part of Hogarth's attempt to found an distinctively British school of history painting. It is thought that Hogarth was hoping that more commissions for similar scenes would come flowing in after painting this scene, but this did not happen.\n\nIt measures and depicts a scene from Act 1 scene ii of William Shakespeare's play, \"The Tempest\", with Ferdinand courting Miranda. Miranda is depicted sitting on a throne made of shells and coral, distracted and thus spilling from a bowl of milk that she has been feeding to a lamb. To the left is her father Prospero, and further left is Ferdinand. The spirit Ariel floats above, playing a lute or mandolin. To the right is the misshapen monster Caliban, with a bat above his head, grimacing and drooling as he stamps on a dove.\n\nThe painting was bought from the Earl of Macclesfield's widow in 1766 by Sir Rowland Winn, 5th Baronet, and was hung on the walls of Nostell Priory, near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England for over two centuries by the Winn Baronets and then their relatives the Barons St Oswald. Nostell Priory was acquired by the National Trust in 1953, but the former owners retained most of the contents.

The term is used to reclaim the word \"slut\" and empower women and girls to have agency over their own sexuality. It may also be used in reference to gay men, who may face disapproval for sexual behaviors considered promiscuous. Slut-shaming rarely happens to heterosexual men.\n\nExamples of slut-shaming include being criticized or punished for violating dress code policies by dressing in perceived sexually provocative ways, requesting access to birth control, having premarital, casual, or promiscuous sex, engaging in prostitution, or when being victim blamed for being raped or otherwise sexually assaulted.\n\nSlut-shaming involves criticizing women for their transgression of accepted codes of sexual conduct, i.e., admonishing them for behavior, attire or desires that are more sexual than society finds acceptable. Author Jessalynn Keller stated, \"The phrase [slut-shaming] became popularized alongside the SlutWalk marches and functions similarly to the 'War on Women,' producing affective connections while additionally working to reclaim the word 'slut' as a source of power and agency for girls and women.\"\n\nSlut-shaming is used by men and women. Slut-shaming functions among girls and women as a way of sublimating sexual jealousy \"into a socially acceptable form of social critique of girls' or women's sexual expression.\" The term is also used to describe victim blaming for rape and other sexual assault. This is done by stating the crime was caused (either in part or in full) by the woman wearing revealing clothing or acting in a sexually provocative manner, before refusing consent to sex, thereby absolving the perpetrator of guilt. Sexually lenient individuals can be at risk of social isolation.\n\nThe action of slut-shaming can be considered to be a form of social punishment and is an aspect of sexism. The social movement falls into the category of feminism. This raises controversy because gender roles do have a significant role in the social movement. The topic of slut-shaming sheds light on the social issues that are associated with the double standard. This is because slut-shaming is usually toward girls and women, and boys and men usually do not get slut-shamed. Slut-shaming is common in America because it is such a high-context culture. Being in a high-context culture, it is easier to be victim blamed. Slut-shaming is strongly associated with victim-blaming.\n\nResearchers from Cornell University found that sentiments similar to slut-shaming appeared in nonsexual, same-sex friendship context as well. The researchers had college women read a vignette describing an imaginary female peer, \"Joan\", then rate their feelings about her personality. To one group of women, Joan was described as having two lifetime sexual partners; to another group, she had had twenty partners. The study found that women—even women who were more promiscuous themselves—rated the Joan with 20 partners as \"less competent, emotionally stable, warm, and dominant than the Joan who'd only boasted two\".\n\nThere is no documented date of origin for the term \"slut-shaming\"; nor the act of it. Rather, although the act of slut-shaming has existed for centuries, discussion of it has grown out of social and cultural relations and the trespassing of boundaries of what is considered normative and acceptable behavior. Second wave of feminism contributed significantly to the definition and act of slut-shaming. Tracing back to the Industrial Revolution and the second World War, men's gender roles were that of the breadwinner. Men made up a majority of the labor force while women were socialized and taught to embrace the cult of domesticity and homemaking. Author Emily Poole argues that the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s increased the rate of both birth control use, as well as rates of premarital sex.\n\nSlut-shaming is prevalent on social media platforms, including the most commonly used: YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. Slut-shaming has occurred on Facebook in controversial exchanges between users that have resulted in convictions to menace, harass and cause offense.\n\nIt has been reported by The Pew Research Center that the most common targets of harassment on the Internet are often young women. Citing that 50% of young female respondents have been called offensive names and or shamed online. In particular, those who were 18 to 24 years of age, experienced varying amounts of severe harassment at astoundingly high rates. Women who have been stalked online were at 26%, while the targets of online sexual harassment were at 25%.\n\nIn the \"Women Studies International Forum\", researcher Jessica Megarry argues that harassment conveyed in a case study of #mencallmethings hashtag found that it was a form of online sexual assault, on specifically Twitter. In this hashtag, women would collectively tweet examples of harassment they have received from men. This kind of harassment included anything from insults related to appearance, name calling, even rape, death threats, i.e., \"slut shaming.\"\n\nOne example of a character in literature has been described as being a recipient of 'slut-shaming' is the character Lily Bart in Edith Wharton's \"House of Mirth\".\n\nThe SlutWalk protest march had its origins in Toronto in response to an incident when a Toronto Police officer told a group of students that they could avoid sexual assault by not dressing like \"'sluts'\". Amber Rose's second annual walk in Los Angeles in 2016 had \"several hundred\" participants. A similar event occurred in Washington DC in 2014.\n\nThe Slut Walk movement has embraced the slut-shame label and has engaged in an act of resignification. Ringrose et al. call the Slut Walk a \"collective movement\" where the focus goes back to the perpetrator and no longer rests on the victim. This act of resignification comes from the work of feminist scholar Judith Butler. In her 1997 work, she argued that labels do not just name and marginalize individuals to particular categories but language also open up an opportunity for resistance.\n\nKrystal Ball characterized the comments of Rush Limbaugh during the Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy as follows: \"If you are a woman who stands up for your rights, you are a slut and your parents should be ashamed of you and we should all have the right to view your sex tapes online. This type of despicable behavior is part and parcel of a time-worn tradition of Slut-Shaming. When women step out line [sic], they are demeaned and degraded into silence. If you say Herman Cain sexually harassed you, you are a slut. If you say Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas sexually harassed you, you are a slut.\"\n\nSlut-shaming has been used as a form of bullying on social media, with some people using revenge pornography tactics to spread intimate photos without consent. In 2012, a California teenager, Audrie Pott, was sexually assaulted by three boys at a party. She committed suicide eight days after photos of her being assaulted were distributed among her peer group.\n\nJames Miller, editor-in-chief, for the Ludwig von Mises Institute of Canada wrote a controversial article defending slut shaming. The article was later taken down, but still received criticism from some libertarians, such as Gina Luttrell of \"Thoughts on Liberty\", an all-female libertarian blog.\n\nComedians Krystyna Hutchinson and Corinne Fischer of \"Sorry About Last Night\" host a podcast entitled “Guys We F****d, The Anti-slut shaming podcast”. This podcast has over 200,000 listeners on each episode that is on SoundCloud. iTunes originally did not make the podcast available and \"...would not comment on whether the show is subject to an official ban,\" but has since been made available on iTunes. The podcast exists to de-stigmatize discussing sex so that slut-shaming becomes less of an issue, Hutchinson explains in an interview with \"The Huffington Post\": “We want to make people feel more comfortable in their own skin. We just got a message from a girl from New Delhi, India, about how she loves the podcast because it makes her feel like it’s OK to be comfortable with your sexuality and enjoy sex. And that made me so happy.”\n\nActivism against slut-shaming takes place worldwide. Participants have covered their bodies in messages reading \"Don't Tell Me How to Dress\" and \"I am not a slut but I like having consensual sex\" and march under a giant banner with the word slut on it. Activism has occurred in Vancouver, New York City, Rio, Jerusalem, Hong Kong and others.\n\nIn 2008, hundreds of South African women protested the local taxi rank wearing miniskirts and t-shirts that read, \"Pissed-Off Women\" after a taxi driver and multiple hawkers confronted a young girl about wearing a short denim miniskirt and penetrated her with their fingers, calling her \"slut\" repeatedly. Protesters wanted to make their message clear; they wanted men to stop harassing women no matter how short their skirts were and that no matter how short it may be, it is never an invitation.\n\nAfter the gang rape of an unconscious sixteen year old girl in Steubenville, Ohio, August 2012, football players spread videos of the assault to other classmates whom some of which posted the videos to Twitter and Instagram. The pictures and video were later removed by authorities, however that did not stop people from hash-tagging \"Whore status\" or \"I have no sympathy for whores\" in their tweets. Members of the collective Anonymous reported names of the rapists and classmates who spread the footage to local authorities. They took to the streets and internet requesting help from the community to bring justice to the Jane Doe who was raped.\n\nMembers of The Arts Effect All-Girl Theater Company have developed a play, \"\", in which they address the damaging impact of slut-shaming and slut culture. The creators note that their play \"is a call to action – a reminder\" that slut-shaming is happening every day, almost everywhere. \"Slut\" is inspired by real-life experiences of 14- to 17-year-old girls from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. The play was shown at the 2013 New York Fringe Festival.\n\nIn her statement on the production, and of slut-shaming in general, author of \"Slut! Growing Up Female with a Bad Reputation\", Leora Tanenbaum writes:\n\"A teenage girl today is caught in an impossible situation. She has to project a sexy image and embrace, to some extent, a 'slutty' identity. Otherwise, she risks being mocked as an irrelevant prude. But if her peers decide she has crossed an invisible, constantly shifting boundary and has become too 'slutty,' she loses all credibility. Even if she was coerced into sex, her identity and reputation are taken from her. Indeed, the power to tell her own story is wrested from her. The Arts Effect's SLUT written by Katie Cappiello vividly represents this irrational, harmful, terrible circumstance...This play is the most powerful and authentic representation of the sexual double standard I have ever seen.\"\n\nAfter experiencing slut-shaming first-hand, Olivia Melville, Paloma Brierly Newton and approximately a dozen other Australian women founded the organization, Sexual Violence Won’t Be Silenced, on August 25, 2015. The association seeks to raise awareness of cyber-bullying and online sexual violence. The founders also launched a petition to the Australian government, requesting that they better train and educate law enforcement officers on how to prevent and punish violent harassment on social media.\n\nGay and bisexual men are also victimized for slut-shaming because of their sexual activity. There has been research supporting that LGBT students were more likely to be bullied and called sluts than heterosexual students. Researchers discussed how these negative experiences of victimization by peers, friends and strangers can lead to \"physical harm, social shaming, and loss of friendships.\" Unlike heterosexual people, LGBT people are more likely to learn about safe sex practices from friends. The group most highly at risk of HIV infection is young gay and bisexual men. Most of the education that young gay and bisexual men receive about safe sex practices is learned from friends, the Internet, hearsay or trial and error.\n\nCriticism of non-heterosexual men's sexual activity can either be said in a humorous context or not. Judgementalism happens when someone mentions gay men's sexual risk behavior or that they have multiple sex partners. This implies that their behavior is \"slutty\" and dirty.\n\nA lot of slut-shaming occurs when non-heterosexual men are in public environments; they may be street-harassed for their sexual orientation. Street harassment includes cat-calling, victim blaming, and slut shaming. Judgmentalism is not a pejorative word compared to women, and slut-shaming may have a positive connotation with men depending on context and relationship.\n\n"}

Many social factors are thought to be relevant for a wide range of health domains. Social epidemiology can therefore address any health outcome, including chronic disease, infectious disease, mental health, and clinical outcomes or disease prognosis. Exposures of interest to social epidemiologists include individual-level measures (e.g., poverty, education, social isolation), contextual factors (e.g., residential segregation or income inequality), and social policies (e.g., policies creating income security or promoting educational access). Analyses that address the independent or synergistic effects of individual or contextual risk factors are often of interest. Understanding the origins of health disparities and identifying strategies to eliminate health disparities is a major focus of social epidemiology.\n\nMajor research challenges in social epidemiology include tools to strengthen causal inference, methods to test theoretical frameworks such as Fundamental Cause Theory, translation of evidence to systems and policy changes that will improve population health, and mostly obscure causal mechanisms between exposures and outcomes. To address obscurity of causal mechanisms in social epidemiology, it has been proposed to integrate molecular pathological epidemiology into social epidemiology.\n\nFor example, questions of interest to epidemiologists include:\n\nSocial epidemiology draws on methodologies and theoretical frameworks from many disciplines, and research overlaps with several social science fields, most notably economics, medical anthropology, medical sociology, health psychology and medical geography, as well as many domains of epidemiology. However, intersecting social science fields often use health and disease in order to explain specifically social phenomenon (such as the growth of lay health advocacy movements), while social epidemiologists generally use social concepts in order to explain patterns of health in the population.\n\nMore recently, the discipline is moving from identifying health inequalities along the social gradient to identifying the policies, programmes and interventions that effectively tackle the observed socioeconomic inequalities in health. Researchers Frank Pega and Ichiro Kawachi from Harvard University have suggested that this may lead to the new discipline of Political Epidemiology, which is more policy-applied in that it identifies effective and cost-effecfive social interventions for government action to improve health equity.<ref name=\"doi10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.06.007\"></ref>\n"}

Freyr's sword is depicted in Norse mythology as one of the few weapons that is capable of fighting on its own. After Freyr gave up the sword to Skírnir for the hand of the giantess Gerðr, he will die at Ragnarök because he didn't have his sword, fighting Surtr with an antler.\nFreyr asks Skírnir to bring Gerðr to him, Skírnir demands his sword from him, and Freyr readily gives it. The loss of Freyr's sword has consequences. According to the \"Prose Edda\", Freyr had to fight Beli without his sword and slew him with an antler. But the result at Ragnarök, the end of the world, will be much more serious. Freyr is fated to fight the fire-giant Surtr and since he does not have his sword he will be defeated.\n\nIn Ragnarok the sun shines \"from the sword of the gods\". The idea is that the sword which Surtr uses to slay Freyr with is his, \"the sword of the gods\" which Freyr had earlier bargained away for Gerðr. This would add a further layer of tragedy to the myth. Sigurður Nordal argued for this view but the possibility represented by Ursula Dronke's translation that it is a simple coincidence is equally possible.\n\nIn Rick Riordan's Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard, the sword of Freyr possessed by the protagonist is called Sumarbrandr meaning 'summer sword'.\n"}
{"id": "2179980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179980", "title": "The Power Elite", "text": "The Power Elite\n\nThe Power Elite is a 1956 book by sociologist C. Wright Mills, in which Mills calls attention to the interwoven interests of the leaders of the military, corporate, and political elements of society and suggests that the ordinary citizen is a relatively powerless subject of manipulation by those entities.\n\nThe book is something of a counterpart of Mills' 1951 work, \"\", which examines the then-growing role of middle managers in American society. A main inspiration for the book was Franz Leopold Neumann's book \"\" in 1942, a study of how Nazism came into a position of power in a democratic state like Germany. \"Behemoth\" had a major impact on Mills and he claimed that Behemoth had given him the \"tools to grasp and analyse the entire total structure and as a warning of what could happen in a modern capitalist democracy\".\n\nAccording to Mills, the eponymous \"power elite\" are those that occupy the dominant positions, in the dominant institutions (military, economic and political) of a dominant country, and their decisions (or lack of decisions) have enormous consequences, not only for the U.S. population but, \"the underlying populations of the world.\" The institutions which they head, Mills posits, are a triumvirate of groups that have succeeded weaker predecessors: (1) \"two or three hundred giant corporations\" which have replaced the traditional agrarian and craft economy, (2) a strong federal political order that has inherited power from \"a decentralized set of several dozen states\" and \"now enters into each and every cranny of the social structure,\" and (3) the military establishment, formerly an object of \"distrust fed by state militia,\" but now an entity with \"all the grim and clumsy efficiency of a sprawling bureaucratic domain.\"\n\nImportantly, and in distinction from modern American conspiracy theory, Mills explains that the elite themselves may not be aware of their status as an elite, noting that \"often they are uncertain about their roles\" and \"without conscious effort, they absorb the aspiration to be ... The Ones Who Decide.\" Nonetheless, he sees them as a quasi-hereditary caste. The members of the power elite, according to Mills, often enter into positions of societal prominence through educations obtained at eastern establishment universities like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. But, Mills notes, \"Harvard or Yale or Princeton is not enough ... the point is not Harvard, but which Harvard?\" Mills identifies two classes of Ivy League alumni, those initiated into an upper echelon fraternity or final club, such as Porcellian and Fly Club, and those who are not. Those so initiated, Mills continues, receive their invitations based on social links first established in elite private preparatory academies, where they are enrolled as part of antebellum family traditions. In this manner, the mantle of the elite generally passes through families. \n\nThe resulting elites, who control the three dominant institutions (military, economy and political system) can be generally grouped into one of six types, according to Mills: \n\nMills formulated a very short summary of his book: \"Who, after all, runs America? No one runs it altogether, but in so far as any group does, the power elite.\"\n\nCommenting on \"The Power Elite\", Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. derisively said, \"I look forward to the time when Mr. Mills hands back his prophet's robes and settles down to being a sociologist again.\"\n\nAdolf Berle noted the book contained \"an uncomfortable degree of truth\", but Mills presented \"an angry cartoon, not a serious picture\". Dennis Wrong described \"The Power Elite\" as \"an uneven blend of journalism, sociology, and moral indignation\".\n\nA review of the book in the \"Louisiana Law Review\" bemoaned that the \"practical danger of Mr. Mills' pessimistic interpretation of the current situation is that his readers will concentrate on answering his prejudicial assertions rather than ponder the results of his really formidable research\".\n\nNonetheless, consideration of the book has become moderately more favorable over time. In 2006, G. William Domhoff wrote, \"Mills looks even better than he did 50 years ago\". Mills' biographer, John Summers, admitted that \"The Power Elite\" was \"vulnerable to the charge of conspiracy-mongering\" but declared that its historical value \"seems assured\". In a purposeful extension of Mills' Power Elite, his proposed International System, and Comparative Sociology, Muhammed Asadi (2012) suggests that the modern World System is highly militarized and a counterpart of the US permanent war economy where a global division of labor based on military Keynesian stabilization exists concomitant with economic accumulation. He calls these countries, militarized states, whose economic growth stabilizes the World System run by the Command States (counterpart to Wallerstein's Core but includes military and political domination in addition to financial and trade domination) just like military spending in the US stabilizes the US economy. Militarization and wars are therefore encouraged by the Command States and facilitated by them just as suggested by Mills in The Causes of World War Three (1958), the preparation for war leads to wars.\n\nEpisode 5 of the Netflix TV series \"Mindhunter\" contains a scene in which one of the main characters, a sociology PhD student Deborah \"Debbie\" Mitford, writes a paper on C. Wright Mills's \"The Power Elite\".\n\n"}

{"id": "21846129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21846129", "title": "Theology of religions", "text": "Theology of religions\n\nThe theology of religions is the branch of theology (mostly represented by Christian, Hindu, Islamic and Jewish theology) and religious studies that attempts to theologically evaluate the phenomena of religions. Three important schools within Christian part of this field are pluralism, inclusivism, and exclusivism, which describe the relation of other religious traditions to Christianity and attempt to answer questions about the nature of God and salvation.\n\nThe American theologian Langdon Brown Gilkey argued that the political situation of the West following World War II set up a need for Christian thinkers to reconsider the place of other religions specifically because of the changing political world:\n\nThe most common model of the view that one takes of other religions has been viewed in a simple, three point model, first articulated by Alan Race.\n\nPluralism is basically the belief that the world religions are true and equally valid in their communication of the truth about God, the world, and salvation. The chief expounder of this view is John Hick of Claremont Graduate School in California, who first propounded it in his book \"God and the Universe of Faiths (1973)\". It has been notably criticized in the declaration Dominus Iesus by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis is the popular view that all religions lead to the same God and all ways lead to heaven. According to Hick, Christianity is not the one and only way of salvation, but one among several. To a pluralist such as Hick, Christianity is not the absolute, unique, and final way to God. While pluralists assert the validity of all religions, they also deny the finality of all religions. According to Hick, in the evolutionary scheme of things in which at isolated ages and places the early religions are succeeded by higher religions, it is the same message of God that comes distinctly to a particular group but in a different form from the others. Hick challenges the older view that Christ or Christianity must be seen at the center of religions. Rather, he says, God must be seen at the center of religions. This view is also called theo-centrism. The pluralistic contention is that although religions have different outward forms, all have the same source.\n\nTo an evangelical Christian, such pluralism only means the abolition of \"kerygmatic\" mission (i.e., the mission of evangelizing the world with the salvific gospel of Jesus Christ). Pluralism has been criticized for masquerading as Christianity when in fact it is an invasive force that comes from outside of Christianity and imperialistically demands the surrender of Christian distinctiveness. Pluralists respond that Christian pluralism is not an invasive force at all, but actually arises from tensions within the Christian tradition, through a process of auto-deconstruction. Some have pointed out similarities between Hick's theo-centrism and Hindu pluralism as propounded in the Bhagavad Gita:\nBy whatsoever way men worship Me, even so do I accept them; for, in all ways, O Partha, men walk in My path\" (IV.11) \nAnother common evangelical criticism of pluralism is that the religions of the world are fundamentally and irreconcilably different. To value them equally requires a devaluation of propositional truth claims. It is for this reason that pluralism is often treated as a form of self-defeating relativism, though pluralists generally do not accept this label. According to John Hick, \"Religious pluralism is emphatically not a form of relativism.\" Hick considers himself a critical realist.\n\nInclusivism is the belief that God is present in non-Christian religions to save adherents through Christ. The inclusivist view has given rise to the concept of the anonymous Christian by which is understood an adherent of a particular religion whom God saves through Christ, but who personally neither knows the Christ of the Bible nor has converted to Biblical Christianity. This position was popularized by the Roman Catholic theologian, Karl Rahner (b. 1904-d.1984).\n\nOne important issue that Rahner raises is about the salvation of those who have never had the opportunity to listen to the gospel Jesus Christ. To Rahner, then, people can be saved apart from allegiance to the Christian church. It is God in Christ who reaches out to the individual in his own personal religious history to save him. Rahner used the term ‘anonymous’ to denote people who experience the grace of God in Christ regardless of what religion they belong to. Inclusivism is based on two axioms: the first is that salvation is through Christ alone, the second is that God wills the whole world to be saved. Consequently, God saves people through Christ alone; however, he makes this possible through ways that extend to all humanity.\n\nTo Rahner, a non-Christian religion is a lawful religion for until its followers have a Christian witness it is a means by which non-Christians gain a right relationship with God. Also, the religion is included in God’s plan of salvation which God has ordained for the communication of His grace.\n\nInclusivism has a great appeal to people because of its sympathetic approach to religion.\n\nExclusivism is the theological position that holds to the finality of the Christian faith in Christ. The finality of Christ means that there is no salvation in non-Christian religions. Notable among the exclusivists of the twentieth century are Samuel Zwemer, Hendrik Kraemer, and Lesslie Newbigin.\n\nBased on the Aristotelian concept of truth as one and not many, exclusivists regard all other religious claims as false and invalid since the Christian revelation is accepted as true. Exclusivists hold that salvation is through Christ alone. It is through a personal experience of commitment to Christ that one receives assurance of salvation. The non-believers cannot receive such assurance since they are neither aware of the uniqueness of Christ neither do they acknowledge His lordship. The exclusivist begins with the Bible as the source of all knowledge about spirituality and salvation. The Bible is the criterion of all religious truth. The Bible relates the history of redemption, gives a foundation to personal faith, is a guidebook of the Christian community, and speaks about the future of the world that links up all history, life, and service with meaning and purpose. Exclusivism, thus, establishes the uniqueness and identity of Christianity among world religions. Such exclusivism can take either an extremist or a moderate viewpoint. The extremist view regards all non-Christian religions as demonic and enemies of Christian truth. On the other hand, the moderate view sees some non-Christian religions as containing elements whereby a dialogue with them can be initiated. However, all exclusivists in general agree that salvation is exclusively only through Christ and received by a personal commitment to the Lord.\n\nAn exclusivist view is inevitable in any dialogue of truth. In fact, neither the pluralist nor the inclusivist could avoid being exclusivist at some point. Truth by nature is exclusive and any claim to truth is exclusive. The only way to deny exclusiveness of Christ is to deny the veracity of the Bible. The exclusivist view sees the exclusiveness of the Bible in its proclamation of Christ as the only way of salvation, though the Bible also speaks of God involved in the history of the nations. Thus, though being very vociferous in his attacks on Hinduism, Nehemiah Goreh could say that ‘Most erroneous as is the teaching of such books as the \"Bhagvadgita,\" the \"Bhagvata\", etc., yet they teach something of \"ananyabhakti\" (undivided devotedness to God), of \"vairagya\" (giving up the world), of \"namrata\" (humility), of \"ksama\" (forbearance), etc., which enables one to appreciate the precepts of Christianity.’\n\nHendrik Kraemer's exclusivism is based on a skepticism towards claims of similarity between religions: \"Every religion is an individisble, and not to be divided\". Religion \"is not a series of tenets, institutions, practices that can be taken one by one as independent items of religious life\".\n\nA significant expansion of the three point model was proposed by Paul F. Knitter in his 2002 book \"Introducing Theologies of Religions\". He outlined four possible views or models that one could adopt.\n\nThis tracks to the third of the three point models, i.e. Exclusivism, but is split into two subsections: Total Replacement and Partial Replacement. The Total Replacement model is most frequently found in Fundamentalist/Evangelical churches, and largely represents the work of Karl Barth. It suggests that the reason the Christian religion is considered true is that it realizes that all religion is false (including itself), and recognizes that the only true belief can be found in Jesus. It does not necessarily say that there is nothing of value in other religions, but simply that there is no use in studying other religions, as everything of value can be found in Christ. The Partial Replacement model has similar things to say about other religions, but does not go so far as to say that there is nothing of value in other religions. It suggests that other religions might have access to God's revelation, but not to God's salvation. This is an important distinction, as it implies that some truth can be found in other religions, but not whole of the truth, and not enough to receive salvation. This view is largely based on the views expressed by the World Council of Churches in their discussion on religious dialogue and theology.\n\nKnitter's main contribution, informed by his Christian faith and the idea that Christianity is a fulfillment of Judaism, implies that, while the previous religion was not wrong, it was incomplete and awaiting later fulfillment. This view is also held by some forms of Islam with respect to Christianity and Judaism before them, as well as by Mormonism and all other faiths who feel they have a later clarification from God.\n\nHowever, one's religion does not have to be founded after others in order to see one's religion as a fulfillment. For instance, some Christian theologians argue that if their faith *arrives* later than the indigenous religion, even if in history Christianity came first, such indigenous systems were \"God's placeholder,\" often with common truths learned from nature mixed with erroneous revelatory truths, that can be fulfilled and corrected with the revealed truth of the Christian Scriptures.\n\nProponents of this view include Karl Rahner, whose appreciation of the phrase \"all grace is Christ's grace\" led him to the controversial theory of \"anonymous Christians\" - those who are already saved by the light they have, yet have not yet heard the gospel.\n\nThis model admits that an admixture of truth, error, and incompleteness of revelation exists in all religions, and we need one another to understand and find the truth. While this is a type of pluralism, it does not go so far as to admit that everyone is right, or that there is no objective truth - it only admits that we must learn from one another to find it. It may be that one or another faith is wrong on even major doctrines - but it is also right and has some value in contributing to the whole. \n\nThis is Knitter's analog of pure pluralism. All paths may lead to God, and no one can affirm surely that their way is correct. We must all learn from one another, and pull back from making any absolute claims about spiritual matters. As a type of utilitarianism, it takes a subjective approach that admits that various viewpoints may work or not work for the individual, and that is the measure of truth, and any claims beyond that are speculation.\n\n"}
{"id": "2298182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2298182", "title": "Traditional grammar", "text": "Traditional grammar\n\nA traditional grammar is a framework for the description of the structure of a language. The roots of traditional grammar are in the work of classical Greek and Latin philologists. The formal study of grammar based on these models became popular during the Renaissance. \n\nTraditional grammars may be contrasted with more modern theories of grammar in theoretical linguistics, which grew out of traditional descriptions. While traditional grammars seek to describe how particular languages are used, or to teach people to speak or read them, grammar frameworks in contemporary linguistics often seek to explain the nature of language knowledge and ability. Traditional grammar is often preferred by prescriptive grammarians and may be regarded as unscientific by those working in linguistics \n\nTraditional Western grammars generally classify words into parts of speech. They describe the patterns for word inflection, and the rules of syntax by which those words are combined into sentences.\n\nAmong the earliest studies of grammar are descriptions of Sanskrit, called vyākaraṇa. The Indian grammarian Pāṇini wrote the \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\", a descriptive grammar of Sanskrit, sometime between the 4th and the 2nd century BCE. This work, along with some grammars of Sanskrit produced around the same time, is often considered the beginning of linguistics as a descriptive science, and consequently wouldn't be considered \"traditional grammar\" despite its aniquity. Although Pāṇini's work was not known in Europe until many centuries later, it is thought to have greatly influenced other grammars produced in Asia, such as the \"Tolkāppiyam\", a Tamil grammar generally dated between the 2nd and 1st century BCE. \n\nThe formal study of grammar became popular in Europe during the Renaissance. Descriptive grammars were rarely used in Classical Greece or in Latin through the Medieval period. During the Renaissance, Latin and Classical Greek were broadly studied along with the literature and philosophy written in those languages. With the invention of the printing press and the use of Vulgate Latin as a lingua franca throughout Europe, the study of grammar became part of language teaching and learning.\n\nAlthough complete grammars were rare, Ancient Greek philologists and Latin teachers of rhetoric produced some descriptions of the structure of language. The descriptions produced by classical grammarians (teachers of philology and rhetoric) provided a model for traditional grammars in Europe. According to linguist William Harris, \"Just as the Renaissance confirmed Greco-Roman tastes in poetry, rhetoric and architecture, it established ancient Grammar, especially that which the Roman school-grammarians had developed by the 4th [century CE], as an inviolate system of logical expression.\" The earliest descriptions of other European languages were modeled on grammars of Latin. The primacy of Latin in traditional grammar persisted until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe use of grammar descriptions in the teaching of language, including foreign language teaching and the study of language arts, has gone in and out of fashion. As education increasingly took place in vernacular languages at the close of the Renaissance, grammars of these languages were produced for teaching. Between 1801 and 1900 there were more than 850 grammars of English published specifically for use in schools. Mastering grammar rules like those derived from the study of Latin has at times been a specific goal of English-language education. This approach to teaching has, however, long competed with approaches that downplay the importance of grammar instruction. Similarly in foreign or second language teaching, the grammar-translation method based on traditional Latin teaching, in which the grammar of the language being learned is described in the student's native language, has competed with approaches such as the direct method or the communicative approach, in which grammar instruction is minimized.\n\nThe parts of speech are an important element of traditional grammars, since patterns of inflection and rules of syntax each depend on a word's part of speech.\n\nAlthough systems vary somewhat, typically traditional grammars name eight parts of speech: nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. These groupings are based on categories of function and meaning in Latin and other Indo-European languages. Some traditional grammars include other parts of speech, such as articles or determiners, though some grammars treat other groupings of words as subcategories of the major parts of speech.\n\nThe traditional definitions of parts of speech refer to the role that a word plays in a sentence, its meaning, or both.\n\n\nContemporary linguists argue that classification based on a mixture of morphosyntactic function and semantic meaning is insufficient for systematic analysis of grammar. Such definitions are not sufficient on their own to assign a word an unambiguous part of speech. Nonetheless, similar definitions have been used in most traditional grammars.\n\nAccidence, also known as inflection, is the change of a word's form depending on its grammatical function. The change may involve the addition of affixes or else changes in the sounds of the word, known as vowel gradation or ablaut. Some words feature irregular inflection, not taking an affix or following a regular pattern of sound change.\n\nVerbs may be inflected for tense, mood, aspect, and voice. A verb inflected for tense and mood is called finite; non-finite verb forms are infinitives or participles.\n\nVerb tense indicates the time that the sentence describes. A verb has person and number, which must agree with the subject of the sentence. The voice of the verb indicates whether the subject of the sentence is active or passive in regard to the verb. A verb also has mood, indicating whether the sentence describes reality or expresses a command, a hypothesis, a hope, etc.\n\nVerbs as well as nouns, pronouns, and adjectives may be inflected for person, number, and gender. The inflection of verbs is also known as conjugation.\n\nNouns, pronouns, and adjectives may also be inflected for case. The inflection of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives is also known as declension.\n\nNoun case indicates how the noun relates to other elements of the sentence (\"I, me\" in \"I see Jesse\" and \"Jesse sees me\"). Number indicates whether the noun refers to one, two, or many instances of its kind. \n\nA traditional means of learning accidence is through conjugation tables or declension tables, lists of the various forms of a word for a learner to memorize. The following tables present partial conjugation of the Latin verb \"esse\" and it's English equivalent, \"be\".\nThis partial table includes only two tenses (present and preterite) and one mood (indicative) in addition to the infinitive. A more complete conjugation table for Latin would also include the subjunctive and imperative moods and the imperfect indicative, which indicates imperfective aspect. In English the imperative often has the same form as the infinitive, while the English subjunctive often has the same form as the indicative. English does not have imperfective aspect as Latin does; it has progressive and perfect aspects in addition to the simple form.\n\nSyntax is the set of rules governing how words combine into phrases and clauses. It deals with the formation of sentences, including rules governing or describing how sentences are formed. In traditional usage, syntax is sometimes called \"grammar\", but the word grammar is also used more broadly to refer to various aspects of language and its usage.\n\nIn traditional grammar syntax, a sentence is analyzed as having two parts, a subject and a predicate. The subject is the thing being talked about. In English and similar languages, the subject usually occurs at the beginning of the sentence, but this is not always the case. The predicate comprises the rest of the sentence, all of the parts of the sentence that are not the subject.\n\nThe subject of a sentence is generally a noun or pronoun, or a phrase containing a noun or pronoun. If the sentence features active voice, the thing named by the subject carries out the action of the sentence; in the case of passive voice, the subject is affected by the action. In sentences with imperative mood, the subject may not be expressed.\n\nThe predicate of a sentence may have many parts, but the only required element is a finite verb. In addition to the verb, the predicate may contain one or more objects, a subject complement, object complements, adpositional phrases (in English, these are prepositional phrases), or adverbial elements.\n\nSome verbs (called transitive verbs) take direct objects; some also take indirect objects. A direct object names the person or thing directly affected by the action of an active sentence. An indirect object names the entity indirectly affected. In a sentence with both a direct and an indirect object, the indirect object generally appears before the direct object.\n\nIn the following sentence, the direct object, \"the book\", is directly affected by the action; it is what is given. The indirect object, \"Nikolai\", is indirectly affected; he receives the book as a result of it being given.\nIn place of an indirect object, a prepositional phrase beginning with \"to\" or \"for\" may occur after the direct object.\n\nA subject complement (variously called a predicative expression, predicative, predicate noun or adjective, or complement) appears in a predicate with a linking verb (also called a copula). A subject complement is a noun, adjective, or phrase that refers to the subject of the linking verb, illustrated in the following examples.\nWhile subject complements describe or modify the subject of a linking verb, object complements describe or modify nouns in the predicate, typically direct or indirect objects, or objects of adpositions. In the following example, the phrase \"sun's origin\" is a complement of the direct object \"Japan\".\n\nA subject and a predicate together make up a clause.\n\nAlthough some traditional grammars consider adpositional phrases and adverbials part of the predicate, many grammars call these elements adjuncts, meaning they are not a required element of the syntactic structure. Adjuncts may occur anywhere in a sentence.\n\nAdpositional phrases can add to or modify the meaning of nouns, verbs, or adjectives. An adpositional phrase is a phrase that features either a preposition, a postposition, or a circumposition. All three types of words have similar function; the difference is where the adposition appears relative to the other words in the phrase. Prepositions occur before their complements while postpositions appear after. Circumpositions consist of two parts, one before the complement and one after.\n\nAn adverbial consists of either a single adverb, an adverbial phrase, or an adverbial clause that modifies either the verb or the sentence as a whole. Some traditional grammars consider adpositional phrases a type of adverb, but many grammars treat these as separate. Adverbials may modify time, place, or manner. Negation is also frequently indicated with adverbials, including adverbs such as English \"not\".\n\n"}
