{"id": "327630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=327630", "title": "Asian values", "text": "Asian values\n\nAsian values was a political ideology of the 1990s, which defined elements of society, culture and history common to the nations of Southeast and East Asia. It aimed to use commonalities – for example, the principle of collectivism – to unify people for their economic and social good and to create a pan-Asian identity. This contrasted with perceived European ideals of the universal rights of man. The concept was advocated by Mahathir Mohamad (Prime Minister of Malaysia, 1981–2003, 2018–present) and by Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister of Singapore, 1959–1990), as well as other Asian leaders. The popularity of the concept waned after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, when it became evident that Asia lacked any coherent regional institutional mechanism to deal with the crisis.\n\nVarious definitions of \"Asian values\" have been put forth. Generally, the phrase alludes to influences by Confucianism – in particular, filial piety or loyalty towards the family, corporation, and nation; the forgoing of personal freedom for the sake of society's stability and prosperity; the pursuit of academic and technological excellence; and, a strong work ethic together with thrift.\n\nProponents of so-called \"Asian values\", who tend to support Asian-style authoritarian governments, claim these values are more appropriate for the region than Western democracy with its emphasis on individual freedoms.\n\n\"Asian values\" were codified and promoted in the Bangkok Declaration of 1993, which re-emphasized the principles of sovereignty, self-determination, and non-interference in civil and political rights. They included:\n\nHistorically, there has been no shared \"Asian\" identity, and the concept of unified geographical regional identity at the time of its popularity in the 20th century was not strictly limited to Asia. Asian values gained popularity in the People's Republic of China, Malaysia (under Mahathir Mohamad), Singapore (under Lee Kuan Yew), Indonesia and in Japan (perhaps as early as the pre World War II era). In the West, the study of Asian values was seen as a way to understand Asia and foster a closer relationship with the region.\n\nProponents in Malaysia and Singapore claim the concept helped reconcile Islam, Confucianism and Hinduism and was unifying because it was different to the philosophy of the West. Lee maintained that, more than economics or politics, a nation's culture would determine its fate. \nIn Japan, a concept of \"Ideals of the East\" was embraced in some nationalist circles because it challenged the West and also because it offered the possibility of Japanese leadership in a \"new Asia\". \nSome attribute the economic success of East and Southeast Asian nations in the 1960s to 1980s to \"Asian values\"; a \"third-way\", Asian political model that was an alternative to totalitarianism and liberal democracy.\n\n\"Asian values\" was also evident in the planning of the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997.\n\nThe popularity of the concept did not persist. Some speculate it might have contributed to the religious, social, cultural and economic changes occurring in Asia in that time; for example, the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of the Suharto regime in Indonesia may have been successfully counteracted by liberal democracy.\n\nIn 2006, Jusuf Kalla, the vice-president of Indonesia, linked Asian values with the proposed East Asian Free Trade Agreement and the East Asian Community arising from the East Asia Summit. He partly defended Asian values by placing emphasis on co-operation over competition.\n\n\"Asian values\" continues to be discussed in academe with reference to the question of the universality human rights (as opposed to a position of cultural relativism).\n\nStudies of rice farming have indicated how large-scale agriculture affected the collectivist mindset of East Asians. Compared to wheat farming, rice farming is a labor-intensive practice that requires cooperation among many people.\n\nA number of criticisms of Asian values have been made. Amartya Sen argues these so-called Asian values cannot operate because of the overriding cultural diversity found in Asia. Lung Ying-tai, a Taiwanese social and political critic, supported by Kim Dae Jung (former President of South Korea) and Lee Teng-hui (former President of Taiwan), argues that \"Asian values\" is doublespeak for suppressing universal values such as freedom of speech and human rights. A common criticism of the concept of Asian values is the perceived success of many Asian democratic societies such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea.\n\n\n"}

Other publishers, notably Saalfield, adopted this format after Whitman achieved success with its early titles, priced initially at 10¢ each (later 15¢).\n\nA Big Little Book was typically 3⅝″ wide and 4½″ high, with 212 to 432 pages making an approximate thickness of 1½″. The interior book design usually displayed full-page black-and-white illustrations on the right side, facing the pages of text on the left. Stories were often related to radio programs (\"The Shadow\"), comic strips (\"The Gumps\"), children's books (\"Uncle Wiggily\"), novels (\"John Carter of Mars\") and movies (\"Bambi\"). Later books of the series had interior color illustrations.\n\nAfter the first Big Little Book, \"The Adventures of Dick Tracy\", was published (December 1932), numerous titles were sold through Woolworth's and other retail store systems during the 1930s. With a name change to Better Little Books during 1938, the series continued into the 1960s. Variations such as Dime Action Books were produced by other publishers, as noted by the Collecting Channel's Andy Hooper:\n\nRecently, Robert Thibadeau's project at Carnegie Mellon has made at least two Big Little Books available online. Thibadeau attempts to \"capture the entire production\" of an old book with facsimile images showing pages with wear and tear. \"We're basically trying to eternalize that book as it is,\" says Thibadeau. The Antique Books Digital Library offers two free Big Little Book titles, \"Tim McCoy on the Tomahawk Trail\" and \"Bronc Peeler The Lone Cowboy\". Fred Harman's \"Bronc Peeler\" was a Western comic strip character who was a precursor to another comic strip drawn by Harman, the more successful \"Red Ryder\".\n\nSam Mendes' film \"Road to Perdition\" (2002) showed a boy reading \"The Lone Ranger\" Big Little Book, but this was an anachronism since the movie is set during 1931, a year prior to the first Big Little Books and two years before \"The Lone Ranger\" premiered January 31, 1933 on radio.\n\nMore than 1,300 Big Little Books and the many publishers are mentioned in Arnold T.

The laws were gradually tightened over time, with academics noting that the harsh 1941 and 1961 restrictions occurred during periods where the authorities feared unrest in the lower classes.\n\nWhile cannabis use had been customary in Jamaica for over a century, in the 1960s cannabis farmers began to take advantage of the growing demand in Europe and North America, leading to increased police enforcement, but also corruption of the security and political systems by the profits from international trafficking.\n\nIn February 2015, Jamaica's legislature voted to amend the nation's cannabis laws:\n\nIn April 2015, Jamaica planted its first legal cannabis plant, at the University of the West Indies Mona campus.\n\nIn March 2018, Balram Vaswani, a long time advocate for the legalization of marijuana, opened the first legal medical marijuana dispensary, Kaya Herbhouse, in Drax Hall, St. Ann.\n\n\n"}

Immigrant second generation is defined broadly as United States-born children with at least one foreign-born parent, or children born abroad but brought at an early age to the United States. The original survey was conducted with large samples of second-generation immigrant children attending the 8th and 9th grades in public and private schools in the metropolitan areas of Miami/Ft. Lauderdale in Florida and San Diego, California. Conducted in 1992, the first survey had the purpose of ascertaining baseline information on immigrant families, children's demographic characteristics, language use, self-identities, and academic attainment. The total sample size was 5,262. Respondents came from 77 different nationalities, although the sample reflects the most sizable immigrant nationalities in each area. Three years later, corresponding to the time in which respondents were about to graduate from high school, the first follow-up survey was conducted. Its purpose was to examine the evolution of key adaptation outcomes including language knowledge and preference, ethnic identity, self-esteem, and academic attainment over the adolescent years. The survey also sought to establish the proportion of second-generation youths who dropped out of school before graduation. This follow-up survey retrieved 4,288 respondents or 81.5 percent of the original sample. Together with this follow-up survey, a parental survey was conducted. The purpose of this interview was to establish directly characteristics of immigrant parents and families and their outlooks for the future including aspirations and plans for the children. In total, 2,442 parents or 46 percent of the original student sample were interviewed. During 2001-2003, or a decade after the original survey, a final follow-up was conducted. The sample now averaged 24 years of age and, hence, patterns of adaptation in early adulthood could be readily assessed. The original and follow-up surveys were conducted mostly in schools attended by respondents, greatly facilitating access to them. Most respondents had already left school by the time of the second follow-up so they had to be contacted individually in their place of work or residence. Respondents were located not only in the San Diego and Miami areas, but also in more than 30 different states, with some surveys returned from military bases overseas. Mailed questionnaires were the principal source of completed data in this third survey. In total, CILS-III retrieved complete or partial information on 3,613 respondents representing 68.9 percent of the original sample and 84.3 percent of the first follow-up. Relevant adaptation outcomes measured in this survey include educational attainment, employment and occupational status, income, civil status and ethnicity of spouses/partners, political attitudes and participation, ethnic and racial identities, delinquency and incarceration, attitudes and levels of identification with American society, and plans for the future. \n\n"}

McDonnell later announced, \"The proclamation issued by this Office designating April as Confederate History Month contained a major omission. The failure to include any reference to slavery was a mistake, and for that I apologize to any fellow Virginian who has been offended or disappointed.

{"id": "45162114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45162114", "title": "East Slavic honorifics", "text": "East Slavic honorifics\n\nThe system of East Slavic honorifics is used by the speakers of East Slavic languages to linguistically encode relative social status, degree of respect and the nature of interpersonal relationship. Typical linguistic tools employed for this purpose include using different parts of a person's full name, name suffixes, and honorific plural.\n\nThe most important, grammaticalized distinction is between plain (T) and honorific (V) form, the latter being expressed through honorific second person plural, reflected both in personal pronouns and verb declension. Historically, it used to be accompanied by \"slovoyers\" (enclitic -s added to one or several words of a phrase) and analytic verb form “\"изволить\" + infinitive”, both of which gradually fell out of use.\n\nThe choice between T and V forms is influenced by a number of factors, such as relative age and position, relationship between the speaker and the addressee, as well the general formality of the situation.\nGenerally, T-form is reserved to informal communication between friends and family members. Depending on the corporate culture, it may also be used between colleagues of the same age. Sometimes T-form is used unilaterally to address one’s inferiors, e.g. by a boss addressing employees or by a teacher addressing students, or by and elder addressing junior.\n\nV-form is used in all formal circumstances, to address elders and superiors, or just to express respect and politeness. It is characterized by using second plural form of second person pronoun (often capitalized in writing to distinguish from actual plural) and second person plural verb forms in all moods. Hortative mood has special polite form ending with –те (-te): пойдёмте (poydemte) instead of пойдём (poydem).\n\nModern East Slavic names are tripartite, consisting of family name, given name, and patronymic. Each of these components can be used alone or in different combinations; additionally, most given names have suppletively derived short form, which can be further suffixed to produce a number of diminutives conveying different emotional meaning and applicable in different contexts.\n\nMuch like other languages, in East Slavic one can address a person by words other than name or nickname, which can be divided into polite (e.g. \"господин (gospodin)\", “sir”), vernacular (e.g. \"братан (bratan)\", “bro”) and codified (such as military ranks and styles of office). Some of them may serve as titles, prefixing a person’s name.\n\nStyles in Russian Empire\nSince the time of Peter the Great, forms of address in the Russian Empire had been well-codified, determined by a person’s title of honor, as well as military or civil rank (see Table of Ranks) and ecclesiastical order. One’s position within the clergy was considered most important, followed by title, and then by civil/military rank, e.g. a commoner in rank of Privy Councilor would be styled His Excellency, a prince of the same rank would retain the style of His Highness, while the same prince serving as an archbishop would be referred as His High Eminence. All of these styles are now obsolete and are only used in historical context.\n\nModern Styles of Office\n\nUnlike English and many other languages, addressing a person by their office is highly uncommon outside of protocol context (e. g. even during an official meeting it is very unlikely for anybody to personally address a chairman as “Mr. Chairman”). On the other hand, military or paramilitary rank is commonly used, either as a title before one’s name, or by itself, usually preceded by the title \"товарищ (comrade)\", e.g. \"лейтенант Петров (lieutenant Petrov)\", or \"товарищ лейтенант\" (lieutenant, sir; literally “comrade lieutenant”).\n\nCommon titles and appellations\n\nDuring the Soviet era, the word товарищ (comrade) served as a universal form of address. Later it fell out of use due to its sexlessness and political connotations, while pre-soviet styles seemed either archaic or too pompous (with the possible exception of Ukrainian language, where the old honorific \"пан (pan)\" seems to be successfully readopted). Eventually, such words as девушка \"(lady)\", \"молодой человек (young man)\", and even \"мужчина (man)\" and \"женщина (woman)\" have been adopted as default forms of addressing strangers, which may seem awkward or even rude to a foreigner.\n\nBelow is the list of common East Slavic titles given in Russian Cyrillic spelling and English transcription. Note that some of them can be only used alone, while others can become prefixes before names or other appellations.\n\nBy using different parts of a person’s name in different forms, combined with T- or V-addressing, with or without titles and honorifics, one can produce at least 20 forms of address, all of which are fairly common, but used in different circumstances, as explained below:\n\nFull name + Patronymic + Surname\n\nHighly formal, used in documents or official setting. Surname-first order is considered bureaucratic, and name-first order more organic\n\nFull name + Patronymic\n\nGeneral polite form of addressing, comparable to English Mr./Ms. + Surname\n\nTitle + Surname\n\nFeature of bureaucratic speech used in certain official contexts\n\nNB: the above three forms sound unnatural with T-form of address, but may be used ironically or sarcastically\n\nAppellation only\n\nT-form: Used to informally address strangers in certain situations\n\nV-form: Used to address strangers politely\n\nTitle + Given name\n\nCommon feature of baby-talk with \"тётя (tyotya)\" and \"дядя (dyadya)\" titles and either full or short form of given name, T and V forms both acceptable; also used towards and between clergy with such titles as \"отец (otets, \"father\"),\" \"брат (brat, \"brother\")\". Marginal examples of other usage exist, e.g. a renowned revolutionary Theodor Sergeyev used a nickname “Comrade Artyom” (Artyom being a male given name).\n\nMilitary rank\n\nRegulations of most military and paramilitary organizations require their members to address each other in V-from; subordinates shall address commanders as \"товарищ (tovarisch, \"comrade)\" + military rank, while higher-ups address subordinates by military rank and surname.\n\nMilitary men sometimes use same forms of address, albeit in singular, in friendly conversation\n\nSurname only\n\nMay be used as a rather impolite way to address one’s subordinates, pupils, students, etc. Especially rude when used with T-form\n\nFull given name only\n\nMay be used in V-form between colleagues of the same age. This form became used more often recently to mimic the corporate culture of Western companies, but is not very natural, as one would normally use either \"имя-отчество (imya-otchestvo)\" — name & patronimic — or short name\n\nShort name only\n\nT-form: Default way of informally addressing acquaintances, colleagues, friends etc. Generally considered impolite when used towards people older than oneself (except close family members, though in the Ukraine it is common to address one's parents with V-form)\n\nV-form: Polite way to address one’s juniors and subordinates, or distantly known acquaintances, in moderately formal context\n\nAffectionate diminutive\n\nT-form: Demonstrates care and affection, though may be considered baby-talk. Commonly used towards children, between lovers and intimate friends, though generally not between male friends\n\nV-form: May be used same way as short name + plural, especially to address one’s juniors or people of the opposite sex. In Russian classics, it is commonly depicted to be used by aristocrats, who remained polite even with intimate friends.\n\nVernacular diminutive\n\nOnly used with T-form, expressing familiar, highly informal attitude. May be used by elders within a family or close friends, rude otherwise\n\nSlang diminutive\nExpresses informal, brotherly attitude. May be used between male friends\n\nPatronimic only\n\nSame as slang diminutive, but used mostly within older generations and not limited to males. In this particular case, some patronymics assume vernacular form with the suffixes –ych/vna- rather than –ovich/ovna-, e.g. \"Ivanovich\" becomes \"Ivanych\". Sometimes an even more informal patronymic may be derived by using person’s father’s short name as a base, e.g. \"Kolyanych\" instead of \"Nikolaich\" \"(Kolya\" being short form of \"Nikolay)\"\n\n"}

It has been hypothesized that the threat to the internet, infrastructure and services posed by squirrels may exceed that posed by terrorists. Although many commentators have highlighted the lighter side of the concern, squirrels have proven consistently able to cripple power grids in the U.S. and other countries. While some commentators emphasize the humorous aspect, they still imply that the danger posed to the electrical grid from squirrels is ongoing and concerning. Instances of power grid shutdowns caused by squirrels have been tabulated.\n\nElectrical disruptions caused by squirrels are common and widespread. Between Memorial Day and August 31, 2013, 50 power outages caused by squirrels (POCBS) were recorded in 24 U.S. states. Cities affected by POCBS included Mason City, Iowa and Portland, Oregon. Most media coverage of such events has compared the number of electrical grid shutdowns due to squirrels and those due to terrorists. Commentators often embellish and parody descriptions of the squirrels responsible for interrupting electrical service with allusions to military action or concerns, for example: \"Squirrels mobilize, plot acts of cyber terrorism against humankind—And they're not acting alone.\" or \"Squirrelus interruptus: 5 things shut down by squirrels—How can a squirrel bring a nuclear weapons site to its knees?\" Electrical grids are not the only types of infrastructure at risk from squirrels, but nuclear weapons sites have also been described as targets of squirrel attention. Ground squirrels have interfered with underground nuclear missile sites at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The squirrels are able to tunnel under fences, bypassing motion detectors. Like their arboreal relatives, they can damage electrical cables by biting them. In addition, those that do take above-ground routes onto the base trigger thousands of false alarms each year.\n\nSquirrels damage electrical distribution facilities by tunneling, by chewing through electrical insulation, or by simultaneously coming into contact with two conductors at different electrical potentials. Typically the animal is killed by the passage of current through its body. Prevention is complicated by the ability of squirrels to bypass plastic animal guards, gnaw through insulation and squeeze through small openings into substations. Some utilities are beginning to prevent animals from compromising the power supply by developing automated switching capabilities and other features designed to forestall service disruptions caused by squirrel damage.\n\nSquirrel-caused grid disruption in the U.S. is monitored by the American Public Power Association (APPA). The APPA has developed a data tracker called \"The Squirrel Index\" (TSqI) to analyze the pattern and timing of \"squirrel attacks\" on electrical power systems. The TSqI is a metric that quantifies the rate per 1,000 customers over a period of time, and indicates two peak periods of highest \"squirrel activity\" or \"squirrel peaking months\" (SqPMS) in the year, in May–June and October–November, when disruption is greatest.\nIntentional damage by human terrorists is often the first concern in assessing threats to the U.S. power supply; some cybersecurity experts believe a country's infrastructure, such as its power grid, is a likely terrorist target. But according to the security researcher Cris Thomas, also known by the pseudonym SpaceRogue, \"We've had power outages caused by squirrels in all 50 states ... [including] Hawaii, where they don't even have squirrels, but they do have chickens.\"\n\nA squirrel took out power to Nasdaq's automated trading computer in 1987. The stock exchange went without power for 90 minutes. Twenty million trades were affected. Nasdaq was shut down for about 30 minutes again in 2014 by a squirrel-induced power outage. Other commentators have noted that actual cyber attacks by human terrorists are much rarer than disruption caused by squirrels.\n\nJohn C. Inglis, the former deputy director of the U.S. National Security Agency, said in 2015 that he judged the electrical grid was as likely to be paralyzed by a natural disaster as by a cyberattack and added: \"[F]rankly, the No. 1 threat experienced to date by the U.S. electrical grid is squirrels.\" Along with squirrels, baby-monitoring devices have also have been exposed as potential threats to cyber security.\n\nSimilar concerns exist in Germany, where in 2005, a \"cyber squirrel\" crippled the entire electrical grid south of the River Elster for an hour. This squirrel was described as \"a furry suicide bomber\" (\"pelzige[r] Selbstmordattentäter\").\n\nIn the U.S., squirrels have been the cause of many power outages in Pennsylvania. Cris Thomas has said that in the United States there have been six deaths associated with squirrel attacks on infrastructure, such as downed power lines (and two with other animals).\n\nOne commentator criticized the UK press for what he saw as an emphasis on \"the ethnic struggle between Britain’s populations of red and grey squirrels, and the latter’s demonization (as immigrants and terrorists) and threatened eradication\". In at least one circumstance, a physical attack by a squirrel has been characterized as a \"terrorist squirrel.\"\n\n\n"}

Over the centuries the priory has sustained some damage, and following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, was, like many of its kind, converted into a private house, Ewenny Priory House, which is still inhabited by its current owners, the Turbervill family. The priory is not open to the public apart from the church, where restoration work has been carried out by Cadw. The nave serves as the parish church (Church in Wales).\n\nThe priory was founded in 1141 by Maurice de Londres when he granted the nearby Norman church of St. Michael to the abbey of St. Peter at Gloucester (now Gloucester cathedral), together with the churches of St Brides Major, St. Michael at Colwinston and the manor at Lampha. The church had been built in the 12th century by his father, William de Londres, one of the Norman knights of Glamorgan. The village of Ewenny grew around the Priory and church.\n\nThe priory was dissolved in 1536, and leased in the same year to Sir Edward Carne. In 1545 he purchased the priory, along with its possessions. The estate descended in the Carne family to Edward Carne (died 1650) who was succeeded by his two daughters and co-heirs, Blanche and Martha. Blanche (d 1685) inherited Ewenny, and married her cousin Colonel Sir John Carne (died 1682), of Corntown, near Bridgend. Their son Richard Carne (c.1669-1713) of Ewenny was succeeded by his two sisters and co-heirs, Frances (d 1714) the wife of Edward Turbervill of Sutton, and Jane (d 1741). Edward and Frances Turbervill were succeeded by their son Richard Turbervill, who became the sole owner of the Ewenny estate on the death of his aunt Jane in 1741.\n\nFrom Richard the estate descended to Richard Turbervill Picton, who changed his name to Richard Turbervill Turbervill and died in 1819. He was succeeded by his son Richard Turvervill Turbervill (d 1848), who was succeeded in turn by his brother Colonel Gervase Powell Turberville, who died childless c.1862. The estate then passed to his great-nephew Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Picton-Warlow (died 1892), who changed his name to Thomas Picton-Turbervill in 1867 and from him passed down in the Picton-Turbervill family for several generations.\n\nThe church is a Grade I listed building, the house is Grade II*.\n\n\n"}

In addition to the Italian-speaking area in Europe, Italian-speaking minorities are present in many countries.\n\nItalian is an official language of Italy and San Marino and is spoken fluently by the majority of the countries' populations. Italian is also used in administration and official documents in Vatican City.\n\nItalian is also recognized as an official language in Istria County, Croatia, and Slovenian Istria, where there are significant and historic Italian populations.\n\nIn central-east Europe Italian is first in Montenegro, second in Austria, Croatia, Slovenia, and Ukraine after English, and third in Hungary, Romania and Russia after English and German. But throughout the world, Italian is the fifth most taught foreign language, after English, French, German, and Spanish.\n\nIn the European Union statistics, Italian is spoken as a native language by 13% of the EU population, or 65 million people, mainly in Italy. In the EU, it is spoken as a second language by 3% of the EU population, or 14 million people. Among EU states, the percentage of people able to speak Italian well enough to have a conversation is 66% in Malta, 15% in Slovenia, 14% in Croatia, 8% in Austria, 5% in France and Luxembourg, and 4% in the former West Germany, Greece, Cyprus, and Romania.\n\nIn Albania, it is one of the most spoken languages. This is due to the strong historical ties between Italy and Albania but also the Albanian communities in Italy, and the 19,000 Italians living in Albania. It is reported as high as 70% of the Albanian adult population has some form of knowledge of Italian. Furthermore, the Albanian government has pushed to make Italian a compulsory second language in schools. Today, Italian is the third most spoken language in the country after Albanian and Greek.\n\nThe Italian language is well-known and studied in Albania, another non-EU member, due to its historical ties and geographical proximity to Italy and to the diffusion of Italian television in the country.\n\nItalian is also spoken by a minority in Monaco and France, especially in the southeastern part of the country. It was the official language of Corsica until 1859. Ligurian is recognized as a regional language in the department of the Alpes-Maritimes, furthermore, there is an autochthonous Italian population dating from the Kingdom of Sardinia, which controlled the area until the 1860, regardless the more recent Italian immigrants of the twentieth century.\n\nItalian is widely spoken in Malta, where nearly two-thirds of the population can speak it fluently. Italian served as Malta's official language until 1934, when it was abolished by the British colonial administration amid strong local opposition.\n\nIt is used as the official language of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a Roman Catholic chivalric order which, while not a nation per se, is still recognized as a sovereign subject of international law.\n\nItalian is official, together with French, German and Romansch in Switzerland, with most of the 0.7 million speakers concentrated in the south of the country, in the cantons of Ticino and southern Graubünden (predominately in Italian Grigioni). Italian is the third most spoken language in Switzerland (after German and French), and its use has modestly declined since the 1970s.\n\nDue to heavy Italian influence during the Italian colonial period, Italian is still understood by some in former colonies. Outside former colonies, Italian is also understood and spoken in Tunisia and Egypt by a small part of the population.\n\nIn Eritrea, Italian is at times used in commerce and the capital city Asmara still has one Italian-language school. \n\nAlthough it was the primary language in Libya since colonial rule, Italian greatly declined under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, who expelled the Italian Libyan population and made Arabic the sole official language of the country. Nevertheless, Italian continues to be used in economic sectors in Libya. \n\nItalian was also introduced to Somalia through colonialism and was the sole official language of administration and education during the colonial period but fell out of use after government, educational and economic infrastructure were destroyed in the Somali Civil War. Italian is still understood by some elderly and other people. The official languages of the Somali Republic are Somali (Maay and Maxaatiri) and Arabic. The working languages during the Transitional Federal Government were Italian and English.\n\nIn Canada, Italian is the second most spoken non-official language when varieties of Chinese are not grouped together, with over 660,000 speakers (or about 2.1% of the population) according to the 2006 Census.\n\nIn Costa Rica, Central America, Italian is one of the most important immigration community languages, after English. It is spoken in the southern area of the country in cities like San Vito and other communities of Coto Brus, near the south borderline with Panama.\n\nItalian immigrants to South America have also brought a presence of the language to that continent. Italian is the second most spoken language in Argentina after the official language of Spanish, with over 1 million (mainly of the older generation) speaking it at home, and Italian has also influenced the dialect of Spanish spoken in Argentina and Uruguay, mostly in phonology, known as Rioplatense Spanish. Its impact can also be see Its impact can also be seen in the Portuguese prosody of the Brazilian state of São Paulo, which itself has 15 million Italian descendants. Italian bilingual speakers can be found in the Southeast of Brazil as well as in the South. In Venezuela, Italian is the second most spoken language after Spanish, with around 200,000 speakers. Smaller Italian-speaking minorities on the continent are also found in Paraguay and Ecuador.\n\nAlthough over 17 million Americans are of Italian descent, only a little over one million people in the United States speak Italian at home. Nevertheless, an Italian language media market does exist in the country. On the other hand, although technology allows for the Italian language to spread globally, there has been a decrease in the number of Italian speakers in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Italian speakers in 1980 was 1,614,344. In 1990, the number of Italian speakers in the United States dropped to 1,308,648. In 2000, the number of speakers decreased to 1,008,370, and finally, in 2010, the number of Italian speakers plummeted to 725,223. The percent change from 1980–2010 was a negative 55.2.\n\nIn the United States, Italian is the fourth most taught foreign language after Spanish, French, and German, in that order (or the fifth if American Sign Language is considered). \n\nIn Australia, Italian is the second most spoken foreign language after Chinese, with 1.4% of the population speaking it as their home language. The Italo-Australian dialect came into note in the 1970s by Italian linguist Tullio De Mauro.\n"}

{"id": "10838363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10838363", "title": "Israeli views on the peace process", "text": "Israeli views on the peace process\n\nThis article examines Israeli views of the peace process that is ongoing concerning the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. There are a multitude of opinions and views of the peace process elicited at various points during Israel's history and by a variety of people. A popular understanding of the origins of the conflict from the Israeli point of view is that it began following the 1967 Six-Day War with Israel's occupation of the territories and consequently the peace process negotiations should stem from this. However, there are other understandings of the conflict and therefore the solution for peace, including some Israeli academics' and peace activists' understanding that a much longer history is involved, differing from the popular narrative often recited. Suggestions for how to achieve peace in the region include a two state solution where an Israeli sovereign state and a Palestinian sovereign state exist side by side, or the suggestion of a one state secular solution where power is shared by Israelis and Palestinians. Hardliners believe that Israel should maintain sovereignty over the land it currently occupies and give no concessions to Palestinians, others believe keeping up the military campaign, occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and separation from Palestinians is the only current way forward. There is also a note of despair and uncertainness as to how to proceed among some, particularly following the failure of peace summits in the 1990s and early 21st century and the second Intifada, as Kaufman \"et al.\" have stated; \"there is a growing consensus that the current political leadership are not able to build a stable peace and resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people\". As Cowen says \"almost everyone wants peace [but] on his or her terms\" and this is the crux of the problem.\n\nThe article looks at the views demonstrated in Israel following particular attempts to create peace between Israel and Palestinian groups; such as the Oslo Accords, the Camp David 2000 summit and the Road Map for Peace. Also scrutinized are the views of key Israeli political figures and public opinions at particular points. This article intentionally only focuses on Israeli points of view and not Palestinian views (see: Palestinian views of the peace process), it is not a history of the peace process (see: Israeli–Palestinian peace process) or the conflict (see: history of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict) and it specifically looks at the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and peace process and not Israel's relations more generally with the Arab world (see: Arab–Israeli conflict; history of the Arab–Israeli conflict).\n\nAlmost every Israeli prime minister has called for peace talks with moderate Arab leaders over the years.\n\nThe understanding given to the history of events between Israelis and Palestinians has a bearing on the solutions sought for peace and how far each side is prepared to compromise to create a peace deal.\n\nWhat Slater terms the \"traditional narrative\" and Pappe calls the \"common version\" essentially refer to where Israelis place themselves in relation to Palestinians and the wider Arab world and in a particular version of past events. This \"traditional\" or \"common\" narrative, as the terms suggest, is both popular and well established in the mindset of many Israelis, both civilians and politicians alike and others outside of the state, particularly in the West. The narrative broadly holds that in the 1940s the Arabs were unwilling to negotiate and it was they who instructed their people to flee in 1948 creating the refugee problem that persists today. That there are a group of Palestinians who are terrorists who wish to destroy Israel and that the Palestinians are too demanding in their peace negotiations which reflects extremism within Palestinian society, and although the destruction of Israel was initially an aim of groups such as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and remains one for some such as Hamas, just as the idea of creating an Israeli state covering the occupied territories remains an aim for some Israelis, this has largely been rejected as an aim now and the PLO officially recognised Israel in 1988. Part of this traditional narrative is the belief that the causes of the conflict lie in the 1967 Six-Day War and consequently peace discussions should form around the discussion of territorial negotiation. Such a narrative leads to certain assumptions about what is acceptable in peace creation and influences how Israelis who hold this perception view the peace process. Slater goes as far as to say that, in his opinion, the conflict continues partly as a result of this \"mythology\" of Israel's situation in the Middle East and the Palestinian \"other\".\n\nThere is an alternative to this traditional narrative: a growing scholarship from Israeli academics and peace activists looking at the history of relations between Israel and Palestine has developed what has become known as a \"new history\". Ilan Pappe's work referenced here can be considered part of this trend. It has reassessed Israel's role in conflict creation and continuation, demonstrating an awareness of both Israeli and Palestinian roles in the process. As a result of its understanding that the conflict reaches back beyond the Six-Day War, the narrative recognises different causes for the conflict to be beyond Palestinian anti-Semitism and towards Zionism's insistence on creating a Jewish state in Palestine for example, and consequently views the peace process differently; less fearfully of Palestinian intentions and more sympathetically to Palestinian wishes.\n\nThe response by Israeli politicians and the general public to high-profile peace attempts give an indication of how these events, and therefore the peace process, have been viewed. Although separated here these peace process events are part of an ongoing process of negotiations, changing events and opinions.\n\n\"See Oslo Accords for details of the agreement.\"\n\nThe agreement made in Oslo in August 1993 between Israel and the PLO was seen as a great step forward by many, although views of the Accords were not homogeneous. Some hailed Rabin's concession to consider the option of Palestinian self-rule as a welcome move towards peace and away from his hardliner background, others, both within rightwing Israeli politics and sections of society saw it as too great a concession on Israel's behalf. This view is demonstrated by the assassination of Rabin in 1995 by a rightwing radical Yigal Amir who opposed his signing the Oslo Accords and served to highlight the differences in opinion held within Israeli society as to the direction the peace process and consequently Israel should take. Suspicion of the reason for Palestinian agreement was held by a few who maintained the view that Palestinians wanted to destroy the state of Israel and that they would not attempt to keep the peace. The continued and increased attacks by some sectors of Palestinian society did nothing to aid the view that the Palestinians would not keep their side of the deal.\n\nIsraeli commentators lay blame for the failure of the Oslo Accords at Yasser Arafat's door believing his leadership to be corrupt and dictatorial rather than looking at events of Israel's making. The Oslo Accords, like previous talks had avoided key issues and the view of peace put forward by Israeli negotiators remained based on the notion of limited sovereignty over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank without resolving the right to return of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 conflict avoided the longer term view of the causes of the conflict. The issue of Israeli settlements was not concluded, and the extensive building that took place following the Oslo Accords was cited as evidence that the views of Rabin and Israelis in power who did not act in the \"spirit of Oslo\". The issue of settlements throws up the particular and fairly extreme view of the religious-right in Israel at the time that believed negotiating over territory and the possibility of Palestinian self-rule in the religiously symbolic territories undermined what it meant to be Israeli. Settlers also viewed the peace process at this point as a threat due to the possibility that their homes and livelihoods would be at risk. The initial building of settlements and the continuation of such schemes, despite the Oslo Accords rhetoric demonstrates that those at the top of Israeli politics did not seriously envisage creating a viable Palestinian state as part of the peace process. For citizens outside the nationalist right the period around the Oslo Accords represented a time when negotiation over territory became acceptable on the understanding that the alternative was the probability that Israel would have to lose either its liberal democracy or Zionist identity.\n\n\"See Camp David 2000 Summit for detail of the summit.\"\n\nThe Camp David summit in the summer of 2000 involving United States President Bill Clinton, Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, was an attempt to agree a deal to finalise issues that would create a peace settlement. Its outcome however was a deadlock and a rejection by Arafat of Barak's offer which offered most of Arafat's demands, withholding only the demand for sole Arab control over the temple mount, the demand for complete repatriation of millions of Arabs into Israel proper, and about 30% of the contested territory. According to Ben-Ami the left in Israel believed Barak and his team had not offered enough to the Palestinian’s to make it a viable option, and the right believed too many concessions were offered and that the failure of the peace process was what they had expected. A conflict of views on the peace process was clearly evident within Israel due mainly to traditional views on the character of Israel as a Jewish state, and a newfound desperation among some for peace at any cost.\n\nIsraeli left wing analysts have since put forward a version of events that imply Barak and his team did not go far enough to allow Arafat to comply and that far from blaming Arafat for rejecting a reasonable offer they hold empathy with the Palestinian predicament. Slater's view is that: \"despite the widespread misrepresentation that Ehud Barak offered Palestinians 'generous' peace proposals at Camp David, Israel is still resisting the creation of a genuinely viable and independent Palestinian state.\" Highlighting the consistency throughout the peace process for him of a desire to maintain control over any threat to a Jewish state the Palestinians might have by controlling them. Barak did not acknowledge the role of Israel in the Palestinian refugee situation, highlighting his view of the peace process remains based in the traditional narrative understandings discussed at the top of this article. The collapse of the peace talks and the subsequent Second Intifada uprising left many Israelis to view the peace process as failing and having led to lives of greater insecurity and an increasing sense that the Palestinians ask for too much and offer violence in return and thus the two state solution with Israel's withdrawal to something like the 1967 borders that had seemed to be becoming a possibility became far more unlikely save for some academics and peace activists.\n\n\"See Road Map for Peace for detail of the negotiations.\"\n\nThe Road Map for Peace was introduced by George W. Bush’s administration in co-operation with Russia, the European Union and the United Nations to try and instigate a phased path to peace. However the Road Map receive little genuine attention from either side of the conflict, other than, as Ben-Ami says, to keep the Americans onside, the real gain Israel received was the assurance of a removal of the military threats from other states in the region. Sharon’s rightwing government were not keen to see a true revival of the peace process after a couple of years of the violence of the Second Intifada and paid it little more than lipservice.\n\nThe views of the peace process held by these figures, articulated by their political action or inaction, all of whom have held the office of Israeli Prime Minister, complement and contrast with each other, often while working in conjunction with each other at the top of Israeli politics.\n\nYitzhak Shamir, Israeli Prime Minister from 1983 to 1984 and again from 1986 to 1992 following a two-year spell as part of a coalition government between his Likud Party and the Labor Party, is considered one of the most hard-line Prime Ministers Israel has had. Accordingly, in a period of time where relations between Israel and other Arab states were beginning to shift and global changes were being witnessed towards the end of the Cold War, Shamir opposed shifts or compromise on the situation in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. His view of the peace process at a time when the PLO were moving towards recognition of Israel and a two state solution was that territory should not be part of the negotiation and consequently with the moving times and relations obvious at the peace talks in Madrid he felt both under siege and indifference according to Ben-Ami.\n\nYitzhak Rabin, a hardliner who had two terms as Prime Minister, was instrumental in the continuation of settlements and did not wish for the peace process to go in the direction of Israeli and Palestinian states existing next door to each other. However it was he who suggested an exchange of an end to the first intifada in return for Palestinian autonomy at the end of the 1980s. When Prime Minister for the second time, it was also his role in negotiations at Oslo that led to the so-called breakthrough in the peace process, acknowledging the PLO and the move towards Israeli withdrawal from the territories. His plans after the Oslo accords of continued settlement and road building in the occupied territories demonstrated his true views on the peace process; not a desire to return to 1967 borders but a separation in some form of Palestinians from Israelis. However it is suggested by Slater that towards the end of his life he was moving toward the idea of some kind of Palestinian state. Rabin also saw peace as essential for Israel to build up its economy and not only that but peace to increase regional development and standards of living not just in Israel.\n\nShimon Peres has held many posts within Israeli politics, including the role of Prime Minister. He is credited as being a key instigator in the occurrence of the Oslo Accords and held many similar views towards the peace process as Rabin. The Camp David negotiations in 2000 brought Peres' criticism for the making of too many concessions for the Palestinians. For he held that a viable Palestinian state should not be formed and consequently stepped up the move to make inroads into Palestinian territories.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu became Prime Minister as leader of the Likud Party in 1996 and had an immediate effect, and an adverse one according to Yakan, on the peace process. He attempted to slow down the Oslo process in order to create better security and due to his severe reservations of it. Netanyahu is a recognised opponent of territorial negotiation and land for peace deals and he wanted results rather than declarations. The regard he and other Likud members held Rabin and Peres in following their negotiations with the PLO during the Oslo process demonstrates his view of the peace process as undesirable and as abandoning the notion of what Israel should be. He, like his successors in office, Barak and Sharon, believed that if the creation of some form of Palestinian state was completely unavoidable it should only be in the Gaza Strip, part of the West Bank, and Israel should remain the military and sovereign ruler over the settlements, all of Jerusalem and important points such as the aquifers.\n\nEhud Barak took office as Prime Minister in 1999 as leader of the Labor Party. His time in office and the decisions he made have been described as \"schizoid\" by Slater for the apparent changes in direction he took. He went further than any other Israeli Prime Minister in the deals he offered the Palestinians at Camp David, but he has himself described his loyalties to the rightwing—he had opposed the Oslo agreements—only making such peace offers out of pragmatism for the knowledge that controlling Palestinians was only going to lead to continued violence. After the failed negotiations and the concessions he offered, he continued to make reference to his desire for a Greater Israel. His view of the peace process therefore seem fairly contradictory and included placing importance on dealing with Israel’s relations with its neighbours such as Syria over dealing directly with Israel's relations with the Palestinians in a hope that the Palestinians would become isolated if peace was secured between Israel and Syria. It was only once this channel was exhausted that Barak would deal with Arafat and the Palestinians. An important view point of Barak's regarding the peace process is that there were no preconceived solutions to the process and negotiations; for him there was not an expectation that Israel would definitely withdraw to the 1967 borders for example, everything was under discussion in an open ended process.\n\nAriel Sharon succeeded Barak as Prime Minister in 2001 and brought with him a rightwing government in the face of the violent period of the second intifada. His reluctance to implement the goals of the 'Road Map for Peace' demonstrated his unwillingness to negotiate and make gestures towards developments in the peace process. Indeed, Ben-Ami says that Sharon has always harboured a hidden agenda: \"the sterilization of the Palestinian national movement…and the confinement of a Palestinian homeland within scattered enclaves surrounded by Israeli settlements, strategic military areas and a network of bypass roads for the exclusive use of the Israeli occupier.\" As Sharon views a Palestinian national movement as a threat to Israel and its 'Jewishness'’ and consequently would rather allow an independent state, although militarily weak. The dismantling of settlements in Gaza, instigated by Sharon, represents not only an unprecedented step by Israel but also that Sharon had decided unilateral action rather than a two state negotiation was the way forward to move towards peace.\n\nIsrael is characterised by a multitude of opinions and views of the peace process that vary across time as well as across society. There are right-wing opinions (both secular and religious) which believe Israel should not concede to Palestinian demands and instead should maintain the original Zionist vision of Israel. There are those that hold left-wing viewpoints that believe Palestinians should have a sovereign state and Israel needs to go further in compromising to create peace; and there is a spread of people in between with varied views. For example, Israeli elites wanted peace in the 1990s so as to build Israel's economy and integrate into the global economy that was opening up in the post–Cold War period. The slowing down and deterioration of peace relations with Palestinians under Netanyahu's leadership frustrated many Israelis who view peace as a path to stability. Public opinions change, as Slater says, the notion of a withdrawal from the territories and Palestinians gaining their own state was unthinkable in most circles prior to the 1990s, however a decade later it was an accepted central theme of the peace process for many. The violence of the second intifada however has altered this opinion to a popular belief that this may no longer be a viable solution as military responses rather than negotiation has taken precedence.\n\n"}

In the pre-Columbian period, the modern-day state of Veracruz was inhabited primarily by four indigenous cultures. The Huastecos and Otomis occupied the north, while the Totonacs resided in the north-center. The Olmecs, one of the oldest cultures in the Americas, became dominant in the southern part of Veracruz. Remains of these past civilizations can be found in archeological sites such as Pánuco, Castillo de Teayo, El Zapotal, Las Higueras, Quiahuiztlán, El Tajín, Cempoala, Tres Zapotes and San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán .\n\nChronology studies of archaeological sites in northern Veracruz show that the area has been occupied at least since 5600 B.C. and show how nomadic hunters and gatherers eventually became sedentary farmers, building more complex societies, even before the rise of the city of El Tajín.\n\nThe pace of this societal progression became more rapid with the rise of the neighboring Olmec civilization around 1150 B.C., although the Olmecs were never here in great numbers.\n\nThe first major civilization in territory of the current state is that of the Olmecs, whose origin is unknown. Theories vary, including a fringe speculation which lacks scientific credibility in which Africans arrive in Campeche then northward to Veracruz over 3,500 years ago. The Olmecs settled in the Coatzacoalcos River region and it became the center of Olmec culture. The main ceremonial center here was San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán. Other major centers in the state include Tres Zapotes in the city of Veracruz and La Venta in Tabasco. The culture reached its height about 2600 years ago, with its best-known artistic expression being the colossal stone heads. These ceremonial sites were the most complex of that early time period. For this reason, many anthropologists consider the Olmec civilization to be the mother culture of the many Mesoamerican cultures that followed it. By 300 BCE, this culture was eclipsed by other emerging cultures in Mesoamerica.\nThe \"Olmec heartland\" is an area in the Gulf lowlands that is generally considered the birthplace of the Olmec culture. This area is characterized by swampy lowlands punctuated by low hills, ridges, and volcanoes. The Tuxtlas Mountains rise sharply in the north, along the Gulf of Mexico's Bay of Campeche. Here the Olmecs constructed permanent city-temple complexes at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, La Venta, Tres Zapotes, and Laguna de los Cerros. In this region, the Mesoamerican civilization would emerge and reign from c.1400–400 BCE.\n\nWhat we today call Olmec first appears within the city of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, where distinctive Olmec features appear around 1400 BCE. Although Olmec civilization traces have been found all around Mesoamerica and it is considered that the Olmecs were a main influence on all regional civilizations.\n\nThe rise of civilization here was assisted by the local ecology of well-watered alluvial soil, as well as by the transportation network that the Coatzacoalcos River basin provided. This environment may be compared to that of other ancient centers of civilization: the Nile, Indus, and Yellow River valleys, and Mesopotamia. This highly productive environment encouraged a densely concentrated population which in turn triggered the rise of an elite class. It was this elite class that provided the social basis for the production of the symbolic and sophisticated luxury artifacts that define Olmec culture. Many of these luxury artifacts, such as jade, obsidian and magnetite, came from distant locations and suggest that early Olmec elites had access to an extensive trading network in Mesoamerica. The source of the most valued jade, for example, is found in the Motagua River valley in eastern Guatemala, and Olmec obsidian has been traced to sources in the Guatemala highlands, such as El Chayal and San Martín Jilotepeque, or in Puebla, distances ranging from 200 to 400 km away (120 – 250 miles away) respectively.\n\nSite studies have been conducted since about 2004 to establish a more accurate chronological setting of the site, as well as its function and purpose of the structures.\n\nFor many years, the existence of thousands of sites is known, distributed across the Veracruz coastal plains, from the Antigua River down to the Coatzacoalcos and Grijalva Rivers, and even down to Campeche; although this type of construction is part of a little known tradition.\n\nTherefore, these findings are unique, there is no information about earthen structures construction techniques in Central Veracruz.\n\nExtensive stratigraphic excavations results provide that, although the platforms existed from the late preclassical period, during the early classical the main plaza had been constructed, bordered by the pyramid and the monumental north and east platforms, that had palaces probably with administrative, ritual and residential functions.\n\nOngoing exploration shows a complex building sequence, with evidence of refined architecture, and human burials with ceramic vessels and figurines offerings.\n\nExcavations are only being conducted on the Pyramid, North Platform and East Platform.\n\nThe pyramid construction probably commenced in the early classical period (100 BCE–300CE), based on ceramic evidence comparisson with findings on the second stage of the North Platform. The three structures have a chronology spanning the first CE millennium.\n\nThe structure was 26 m high, and at least had two building stages, from ceramic remains dated between 100BCE–300CE, early classical and 800–1000 CE, late classical.\n\nThe pyramid, in 1999 was still a 22 m high structure, with 32 degree angle slopes, indicating the use of some technology to control structural pressures of the earthen fill.\n\nThe excavations show that the solution to this problem was alternating fill blocks (approximately 1 m high and more than 6 m on the side) made from clays and sandy loams, readily available in the site surrounding areas. The clay blocks due to their cohesiveness, would form buttresses containing the blocks of sandy loam. Inversely, the sandy loam blocks had better compaction, therefore providing a more stable surface.\n\nThe building had access stariways from the plaza level, the staircase had containment walls with sloping sides.\n\nIt is located to the south of the main plaza.\n\nNo details or information is available.\n\nThis platform contains five buildings, from the second constructive stage; these were part of one of the palaces and probably were used for administrative purposes, with restricted access, with some residential and ceremonial areas.\n\nLocated on the east side of the plaza, were the other palace was possibly erected, at about the same time as the other. Many ceramic figures of “nosed” characters have been found, these were not found on the northern palace.\n\nTwo structures surround the east plaza; these are believed to have been elite residences (palaces), suggesting an organized type of government, at least by 100BCE–100CE, providing new information on the late preclassical (epi-Olmec) and classical period society.\n\nA series of paleosoil samples containing organic matter was found below the structures, possibly part of offerings.\n\nThe excavations revealed the existence burials containing offerings in all platforms, the burials contained human remains, ceramic vessels and figurines.\n\nThe earliest burial was found at the center of the pyramid, apparently deposited on top of paleosoil immediately before the construction. The ceremonial burials seems to have involved the burning of organic material, large patches of carbonized organic matter were located immediately on top of the paleosoil, below the sand fill of the structure.\n\nOther deposits were found in a roughly symmetrical pattern along the central east-west axis. There are two deposits of human bones and a skull covered by a bowl, a complete vessel buried upside down, and lenticular patches of carboniferous earth.\n\n\n\n"}

A small number predates the 9th century; one of the last runestones was raised in memory of the archbishop Absalon (d. 1201).\nA small number of runestones may date to the late medieval to early modern period, such as the Fámjin stone (Faroer Islands), dated to the Reformation period.

The front panels make up a large enthroned Madonna and Child with saints and angels, and a predella of the \"Childhood of Christ\" with prophets. The reverse has the rest of a combined cycle of the \"Life of the Virgin\" and the \"Life of Christ\" in a total of forty-three small scenes; several panels are now dispersed or lost. The base of the panel has an inscription that reads (in translation): \"Holy Mother of God, be thou the cause of peace for Siena and life to Duccio because he painted thee thus.\" Though it took a generation for its effect truly to be felt, Duccio's \"Maestà\" set Italian painting on a course leading away from the hieratic representations of Byzantine art towards more direct presentations of reality.\n\nThe painting was installed in the cathedral of Siena on 9 June 1311. One person who witnessed this event wrote:\n\nAnd on that day when it was brought into the cathedral, all workshops remained closed, and the bishop commanded a great host of devoted priests and monks to file past in solemn procession. This was accompanied by all the high officers of the Commune and by all the people; all honorable citizens of Siena surrounded said panel with candles held in their hands, and women and children followed humbly behind. They accompanied the panel amidst the glorious pealing of bells after a solemn procession on the Piazza del Campo into the very cathedral; and all this out of reverence for the costly panel… The poor received many alms, and we prayed to the Holy Mother of God, our patron saint, that she might in her infinite mercy preserve this our city of Siena from every misfortune, traitor or enemy.\n\nBesides the Virgin Mary and the Baby Jesus, saints depicted in the painting include John the Evangelist (to the left of the throne); Saint Paul; Catherine of Alexandria; John the Baptist (to the right of the throne); Saint Peter; and Saint Agnes. In the foreground are Siena’s various patron saints: Saint Ansanus; Saint Sabinus; Saint Crescentius; and Saint Victor.\n\nCreating this altarpiece assembled from many wood panels bonded together before painting was an arduous undertaking. The work was not only large, the central panel was 7 by 13 feet, but it had to be painted on both sides since it could be seen from all directions when installed on the main altar at the centre of the sanctuary.\n\nThe altarpiece remained in place until 1711, when it was dismantled in order to distribute the pieces between two altars. The five-metre high construction was dismantled and sawn up, and the paintings damaged in the process. Partial restoration took place in 1956. The dismantling also led to pieces going astray, either being sold, or simply unaccounted for. Extant remains of the altarpiece not at Siena are divided among several other museums.\n\nChrist's followers, Joseph and John, remove him from the cross while Nicodemus removes nails from his feet. The Virgin Mary looks into his closed eyes while Mary Magdalene holds his arm, and you can see the painful expression in everyone’s eyes as they tend to the dead Christ. The background has the same gold texture as in the \"Crucifixion\" and the cross that held Christ has blood running onto the ground, increasing the sense of realism in the scene. This panel aroused the emotions of its audiences and the story helped to symbolize the birth of Christianity.\n\nImmediately following the \"Deposition,\" is the depiction of Christ as he is prepared for burial, surrounded by his mourning followers. His mother leans in close to him and kisses him one last time and Mary Magdalene throws her arms towards the sky in anguish. The background retains the gold setting of the \"Deposition\" and \"Crucifixion,\" and the mountains in the background are similar to the mountains portrayed in previous and subsequent panels. These mountains lead the viewer’s eye to Mary who is accompanying him, and then to Christ’s face. This scene also elicits an intense emotional response from its viewers and you can see the close connection that the burial party has to Christ, and especially to the Virgin Mary.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Maesta-altarpiece-by-Duccio\n\n"}

Rather than a single ethnic group, Malaysian Americans descend from a variety of ethnic groups that inhabit the Southeast Asian country of Malaysia, all of which speak different languages and profess different cultures, including Malay, Malaysian Chinese, and Malaysian Indian, as \"Malaysian\" is primarily a national identification. According to answers provided to an open-ended question included in the 2010 United States Census, 26,179 people said that their ancestry or ethnic origin was Malaysian.\n\nHowever, the actual number of Malaysians and their descendants is most likely considerably higher, since Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians are likely to identify simply as \"Chinese American\" and \"Indian American\" on the census; thus Malaysian Americans are predominantly made up of the ethnic Malays. Malaysian Americans are growing both in population and in socioeconomic status.\n\nMalaysians have been coming to New York City, the West Coast of the U.S., and Chicago since the 1970s for job and educational opportunities, partly because of political and economic tensions in Malaysia. Although some students later found jobs in U.S. companies, many students from Chicago returned to Malaysia after their education ended. Community leaders in 2001 estimated that the Malaysian population of metropolitan Chicago had decreased to 600-700 individuals.\n\nThere are three Malaysian government offices in the U.S. whose goal is to assist and supervise Malaysian students. One of them is the Malaysian Student Department (MSD) in Evanston, Illinois, which covers the midwestern part of the U.S. MSD sponsors several events each year for students in the region, including the celebration of Malaysian independence, the Midwest Games (a three-day sporting competition), and Ambassador Award Night, whose function is recognizing the academic achievements of Malaysian students.\n\nMalaysian Americans have created several community associations in the U.S. The Malaysian American Society was founded in 1967 to promote cultural exchanges between Malaysia and the U.S. Other community organizations include the Malaysian Association of Georgia and the Malaysian Association of Southern California.\n\nMalaysian Americans also have created several educational associations. The Malaysian Students Association at the University of Michigan fosters friendships among Malaysian students. The objective of the Malaysia Student Association of St. Louis, Missouri is to maintain close relationships among students after their college graduation. The Malaysian Students Association at The Ohio State University is an organization that represents the Malaysian student community while promoting Malaysia's unique cultural identity at Ohio State. Other educational associations include the University of California-Berkeley Alumni Club of Malaysia and the Harvard Club of Malaysia plus associations at the Illinois Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago.\n\nThe Malaysia Association of America, based in the area of the Chinatown, Flushing in New York City, was credited by the Consul General of Malaysia in New York for getting the New York State Assembly to declare August 31, 2008, to be \"Malaysian American Day\".\n\nThe Malaysian Islamic Study Group (MISG) was founded in Peoria, Illinois in 1976 with the main objective to assist the Malaysian students in walking the path of success whilst they are in America/Canada, fulfilling their responsibilities as students, as members of their communities and as servants of God. After more than 30 years of its establishment, MISG has a sizeable number of members in almost each university in America which has Malaysian students.\n\nIn relation to all the other Islamic organizations in America, MISG is viewed as a foreigners-based Muslim student group that emerged from the Islamic Society of North America. Despite claims that MISG's founding was influenced by the ideology of Abul Ala Maududi, no evidence indicates such opinions. MISG is by and large an independent organization without binding allegiances to any other organizations.\n"}
{"id": "1069099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1069099", "title": "Malcontent", "text": "Malcontent\n\nThe malcontent is a character type that often appeared in early modern drama. The character is discontent with the social structure and other characters in the play—and is often an outsider who observes and comments on the action, and may even acknowledge they are in a play. Shakespeare's Richard III, Iago in \"Othello\", and Jaques in \"As You Like It\" are typical malcontents.\n\nThe role is usually both political and dramatic, with the malcontent voicing dissatisfaction with the usually Machiavellian political atmosphere and often using asides to build up a kind of self-consciousness and awareness of the text itself that other characters in the play lack.\n\nImportant malcontents include Bosola in Webster's \"The Duchess of Malfi\", Vindice in Middleton's \"The Revenger's Tragedy\", Malevole in Marston's \"The Malcontent\", and Hamlet in Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\".\n\nThe morality and sympathy of the malcontent is highly variable, as in the examples above. Sometimes, as in \"Hamlet\" and \"The Malcontent\", they are the sympathetic centre of the play, whereas Iago is a very unsympathetic character. The most important thing about the malcontent is that the character is malcontent—unhappy, unsettled, displeased with the world of the play, eager to change it somehow, or to dispute with it.\n\nThe malcontent is an objective or quasi-objective voice that comments on the play's concerns as though somehow above or beyond them. The concept has much to do with the Renaissance idea of humorism and a surfeit of \"black bile\" which caused melancholy.\n\nThere is an ontological argument regarding Iago: if a malcontent is dissatisfied due to a displacement from their place in the social order, then Iago does not fit. His scheming and disaffection is not clearly motivated by resentment stemming from an injustice done to him.\n\n\n"}

He was a Member of the European Parliament 1999–2004, member of the Convention on the Future of Europe, and officer of the Scottish National Party.\n\nMacCormick was born in Glasgow on 27 May 1941, the son of one of the SNP's founders, John MacCormick. He was educated at the High School of Glasgow. He graduated MA in Philosophy and English Literature at the University of Glasgow, before benefiting from a Snell Exhibition and taking the BA in Jurisprudence at Balliol College, Oxford. At Oxford, MacCormick came under the influence of Professor H. L. A. Hart, and developed an interest in legal philosophy. In 1982 he was awarded the research degree of LLD by the University of Edinburgh.\n\nMacCormick was a lecturer in Jurisprudence at the School of Law, University of Dundee [which was attached to University of St Andrews at that time] from 1965-67. Following this, he was a Fellow and Tutor in Jurisprudence, Balliol College, Oxford 1968-1972, and thereafter held the Regius Chair of Public Law and the Law of Nature and Nations at the University of Edinburgh. He was also Leverhulme Research Professor at Edinburgh from 1997–1999, and from 2004-2008.

He stood for Argyll and Bute in 1997 and came second.\n\nIn September 1998 he was selected by delegates at the SNP's conference as a candidate for the 1999 European Parliament elections. He was elected a Member of the European Parliament, taking a leave of absence from the University of Edinburgh. Professor MacCormick was a member of the Convention on the Future of Europe from 2002–3, drafting the proposed Constitutional Treaty for the European Union. He was voted Scottish Euro MP of the Year in 2001, 2002 and 2003 at the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards, and retired from elected office in 2004 to complete his Leverhulme Research Professorship at Edinburgh.\n\nHe was elected vice president of the SNP in 1999 and remained in the position until 2004. In 2007 MacCormick was appointed as a special advisor on Europe to the newly elected SNP-led Scottish Government.\n\nMacCormick wrote numerous journal articles and books, concentrating both on Law in a European context and the philosophy of law. Works such as \"Legal Right and Social Democracy: Essays in Legal and Political Philosophy\" (1984), \"Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory\" (1978), \"Rhetoric and The Rule of Law\" (2005) and \"Institutions of Law\" (2007) all convey his particular brand of legal philosophy. \"Legal Reasoning and Legal Theory\" answers many of the Dworkinian critiques of the Hartian conception of law, and it is seen by some as showing a middle ground between the two.

{"id": "2477230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2477230", "title": "Nordic Stone Age", "text": "Nordic Stone Age\n\nThe Nordic Stone Age refers to the Stone Age of Scandinavia. During the Weichselian glaciation, almost all of Scandinavia was buried beneath a thick permanent ice cover and the Stone Age came rather late to this region. As the climate slowly warmed up at the end of the ice age, nomadic hunters from central Europe sporadically visited the region, but it was not until around 12,000 BCE before permanent, but nomadic, habitation took root. \n\nAs the ice receded, reindeer grazed the emerging tundra plains of Denmark and southernmost Sweden. This was the era of the Hamburg culture, tribes who hunted over territories 100,000 km² vast and lived as nomads in teepees, following the reindeer seasonal migrations across the barren tundra. On this land there was little plant cover, except for occasional arctic white birch and rowan. Slowly a taiga forest appeared. \n\nAround 11,400 BCE, the Bromme culture emerged in Southern Scandinavia. This was a more rapidly warming era providing opportunity for other substantial hunting game animals than the ubiquitous reindeer. As former hunter-gather cultures, the Bromme culture was still largely dependent on reindeer and lived a nomadic life, but their camps diversified significantly and they were the first people to settle Southern Scandinavia (and the Southern Baltic area) on a permanent, yet still nomadic, basis.\n\nLocal climate changes around 10,500 BCE, initiated both cultural changes and the first settling of the northern parts of Scandinavia. Initially, a thousand year long climate cooldown replaced the taiga with the former tundra and the local culture reverted to former times focus on the reindeer hunt. This culture is now referred to as the Ahrensburg culture. Around 9,500 BCE, the local climate warmed yet again, as the pre-Boreal era emerged, and this triggered the Ahrensburg to settle the emerging tundra of northern Scandinavia. For the next two thousand years, the climatic phase known as the Boreal reigned in the Scandinavian region.\n\nIn the 7th millennium BCE, the climate in Scandinavia was warming as it transitioned from the former Boreal age to the Atlantic period. Reindeer and their hunters had already migrated and inhabited the lands of northern Scandinavia, and forests had established. A culture called the Maglemosian culture lived in the areas of Denmark and southern Sweden. To the north, in Norway and along the coast of western Sweden, the Fosna-Hensbacka culture was living mostly in changing seasonal camps along the shores and close to the now thriving forests. Utilizing fire, boats and stone tools, these Stone Age tribal cultures managed to survive in northern Europe. The northern hunter-gatherers followed the herds and the salmon runs, moving south during the winters, moving north again during the summers. These early peoples followed cultural traditions similar to those practiced throughout other regions in the far north – areas including modern Finland, Russia, and across the Bering Strait into the northernmost strip of North America (comprising portions of today's Alaska and Canada).\n\nDuring the 6th millennium BCE, the climate of Scandinavia was generally warmer and more humid than today and the southern regions were clad in lush temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. Large animals like aurochs, wisent, moose and red deer roamed freely in the forests and were game for tribes of what we now call the Kongemose culture. Like their predecessors, the Kongemose tribes also hunted marine animals such as seals and fished in the rich shallow waters. North of the Kongemose people, lived other hunter-gatherers in most of southern Norway and Sweden, now dubbed the Nøstvet and Lihult cultures, descendants of the Fosna and Hensbacka cultures. By the end of the 6th millennium BCE, as the sea levels rose gradually, these northerly tribal cultures continued their way of life, while the Kongemose culture was replaced by the Ertebølle culture, adapting to the climatic changes affecting their low lying southern regions more severely.\n\nDuring the 5th millennium BCE, the Ertebølle people learned pottery from neighbouring tribes in the south, who had begun to cultivate the land and keep animals. Soon, they too started to cultivate the land and, ca 4000 BCE, they became part of the megalithic Funnelbeaker culture. During the 4th millennium BCE, these Funnelbeaker tribes expanded into Sweden up to Uppland. The Nøstvet and Lihult tribes learned new technology from the advancing farmers, but not agriculture, and became the Pitted Ware cultures, towards the end of the 4th millennium BCE. These Pitted Ware tribes halted the advance of the farmers and pushed them south into south-western Sweden, but some say that the farmers were not killed or chased away, but that they voluntarily joined the Pitted Ware culture and became part of them. At least one settlement appears to be mixed, the Alvastra pile-dwelling.\n\nIt is not known what language these early Scandinavians spoke, but towards the end of the 3rd millennium BCE, they were overrun by new tribes who many scholars think spoke Proto-Indo-European (or more exactly, the \"Pre-Germanic Indo-European\" dialect), the Battle-Axe culture. This new people advanced up to Uppland and the Oslofjord, and they probably provided the language that was the ancestor of the modern Scandinavian languages. These new tribes were individualistic and clearly patriarchal with the battle axe as a status symbol. They were cattle herders and with them most of southern Scandinavia entered the Neolithic. Ultimately, the Bronze Age would usher in a time of cultural advance in Scandinavia.\n\n"}

This principle has largely guided how archival materials are arranged and described in late-19th- and 20th-century archives. The theory posits that ordering groups of records by creatorship provides authenticity and context by evidencing the relationships between records and better manifesting the environment of their creation.\n\nA closely related concept is that of archival integrity, which holds that records emanating from the same source should be kept together.\n\n\"Respect des fonds\" originated from the circular titled \"Instructions pour la mise en ordre et le classement des archives departementales\" (commonly known as \"Circular No. 14\") issued by the French Ministry of the Interior on April 24, 1841 and authored by Natalis de Wailly, head of the Administrative Section of the \"Archives nationales\". The circular instructed archivists \"to assemble the different documents by fonds, that is to say, to form a collection of all the documents which originate from a body, an organization, a family, or an individual, and to arrange the different fonds according to a certain order.\" This method of arrangement was a break from previous ways of arranging archival materials which were largely based on library classifications or idiosyncratic facets such as date, place, subject, kings, and pre- or post-revolutionary origin.\n\nThe principle of \"respect des fonds\" gained widespread acceptance across Europe, informing the development of the related German concept, \"\". The principle was also promoted in the widely influential \"Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives\" (also known as The Dutch Manual) in 1898, further codified by its ratification at the First International Congress of Archivists and Librarians meeting in Brussels in 1910, and featured prominently in the work of eminent British archivist Sir Hilary Jenkinson, who described it as \"[t]he most important of all principles of Archive Management\".\n\n\"Respect des fonds\" is often seen as being composed of the twin principles of provenance and original order. The principle of provenance dictates that archival records are grouped by the organization or individual that created them, whereas the principle of original order dictates that the records within those groupings be maintained in the order fashioned by their creator. Provenance and original order are foundational concepts in archival processing. These dual principles are also described as the \"external\" and \"internal\" order, respectively, of records (\"external\" meaning how records are grouped within an archive; \"internal\" meaning how individual records are arranged within those groups). The explanation by the National Archives of the United States of their Records Group concept demonstrates the influence and legacy of the principle of \"respect des fonds.\"\n\nWhile \"respect des fonds\" is generally considered a core concept of the archival enterprise, some critics have noted both the historical contingency of its creation and also the impracticality of its execution. For instance, critics have shown that \"respect des fonds\" may have arisen from the need to find a simplistic method for novice archivists to manage a growing volume of archival materials. As well, political influences and contestations of historical methods of arranging and describing materials may have influenced the theory's creation. Other critics have argued that grouping records by \"fonds\" does not adequately capture the dynamic, changing nature of contemporary bureaucratic institutions and that maintaining original order prioritizes inscrutable or meaningless arrangement systems of records creators over the usability and accessibility of records by researchers and other users of an archive.\n\nBetween the 1930s and 1950s, the principles of \"respect des fonds\" and archival integrity were repeatedly debated in the context of the work of the Records Preservation Section of the British Records Association (a rescue service for archival material), in regard to the ethical implications of splitting related groups of documents between different archive repositories.\n"}
{"id": "505770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=505770", "title": "Slave states and free states", "text": "Slave states and free states\n\nIn the history of the United States, a slave state was a U.S. state in which the practice of slavery was legal, and a free state was one in which slavery was prohibited or being legally phased out. Historically, in the 17th century, slavery was established in a number of English overseas possessions. In the 18th century, it existed in all the British colonies of North America. In the Thirteen Colonies, the distinction between slave and free states began during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Slavery became a divisive issue and was the primary cause of the American Civil War. The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865, abolished slavery throughout the United States, and the distinction between free and slave states ended.\n\nHistorically, slavery in Eastern North America in the 17th and 18th century began in the English colonies. Slavery in the colonial US was established in each of the Thirteen Colonies. During British colonization, the number of people in slavery expanded, primarily drawn from the Atlantic slave trade. Organized political and social movements to end slavery began in the mid-18th century. The sentiments of the American Revolution (1775-1783) and the equality evoked by the Declaration of Independence stood in contrast to the status of most black Americans. Despite this, thousands of black Americans fought against the British in hopes of a new order. Thousands also joined the British army, encouraged by British offers of freedom in exchange for military service. (\"See Black Patriot and Black Loyalist\").\n\nIn the 1770s, blacks throughout New England began sending petitions to northern legislatures demanding freedom. Five of the Northern self-declared states adopted policies to at least gradually abolish slavery: Pennsylvania (1780), New Hampshire and Massachusetts (1783), Connecticut and Rhode Island (1784). Vermont had abolished slavery in 1777, while it was still independent, and when it joined the United States as the 14th state in 1791, it was the first state to join untainted by slavery. These state jurisdictions thus enacted the first abolition laws in the Americas. By 1804 (including, New York (1799), New Jersey (1804)), all of the northern states had abolished slavery or set measures in place to gradually abolish it.\n\nIn the south, Kentucky was created a slave state from Virginia (1792), and Tennessee was created a slave state from North Carolina (1796). By 1804, before the creation of new states from the federal western territories, the number of slave and free states was eight each. In popular usage, the geographic divide between the slave and free states was called the Mason-Dixon line (between Maryland and Pennsylvania or Delaware).\n\nThe 1787, United States Constitutional Convention debated slavery, and for a time slavery was a major impediment to passage of the new constitution. As a compromise, the institution was acknowledged though never mentioned directly in the constitution, as in the case of the Fugitive Slave Clause. In 1808, the United States outlawed the international slave import trade, but the domestic trade in half the states continued.\n\nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787, passed just before the U.S. Constitution was ratified, had prohibited slavery in the federal Northwest Territory. The southern boundary of the territory was the Ohio River, which was regarded as a westward extension of the Mason-Dixon line. The territory was generally settled by New Englanders and American Revolutionary War veterans granted land there. The 6 states created from the territory were all free states: Ohio (1803), Indiana (1816), Illinois (1818), Michigan (1837), Wisconsin (1848), and Minnesota (1858).\n\nDuring the War of 1812, the British accepted as free all slaves who came into their hands, with no conditions as to military service such as had been made in Dunmore's Proclamation in the Revolutionary War. By the end of the War of 1812, the momentum for antislavery reform, state by state, appeared to run out of steam, with half of the states having already abolished slavery (Northeast), prohibited from the start (Midwest) or committed to eliminating slavery, and half committed to continuing the institution indefinitely (South).\n\nThe potential for political conflict over slavery at a federal level made politicians concerned about the balance of power in the United States Senate, where each State was represented by two Senators. With an equal number of slave states and free states, the Senate was equally divided on issues important to the South. As the population of the free states began to outstrip the population of the slave states, leading to control of the House of Representatives by free states, the Senate became the preoccupation of slave-state politicians interested in maintaining a Congressional veto over federal policy in regard to slavery and other issues important to the South. As a result of this preoccupation, slave states and free states were often admitted into the Union in opposite pairs to maintain the existing Senate balance between slave and free states.\n\nControversy over whether Missouri should be admitted as a slave state resulted in the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which specified that Louisiana Purchase territory north of latitude 36° 30', which described most of Missouri's southern boundary, would be organized as free states and territory south of that line would be reserved for organization as slave states. As part of the compromise, the admission of Maine (1820) as a free state was secured to balance Missouri's admission as a slave state (1820).\n\nThe admission of Texas (1845) and the acquisition of the vast new Mexican Cession territories (1848), after the Mexican–American War, created further North-South conflict. Although the settled portion of Texas was an area rich in cotton plantations and dependent on slave labor, the territory acquired in the Mountain West did not seem hospitable to cotton or slavery.\n\nAs part of the Compromise of 1850, California was admitted as a free state (1850), without a slave state pair. To avoid creating a free state majority in the Senate, California agreed to send one pro-slavery and one anti-slavery senator to Congress.\n\nThe difficulty of identifying territory that could be organized into additional slave states stalled the process of opening the western territories to settlement, while slave state politicians sought a solution, with efforts being made to acquire Cuba (see: Ostend Manifesto, 1852) and to annex Nicaragua (see: Walker affair, 1856–57), both to be slave states.\n\nIn 1854, the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was superseded by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which allowed white male settlers in the new territories to determine through popular sovereignty whether they would allow slavery within each territory. The result was that pro- and anti-slavery elements flooded into Kansas with the goal of voting slavery up or down, leading to bloody fighting. An effort was initiated to organize Kansas for admission as a slave state, paired with Minnesota, but the admission of Kansas as a slave state was blocked because of questions over the legitimacy of its slave state constitution. Anti-slavery settlers in \"Bleeding Kansas\" in the 1850s were called \"Free-Staters\" and \"Free-Soilers\", because they fought (successfully) to include Kansas in the Union as a free state in 1861.\n\nWhen the admission of Minnesota proceeded unimpeded in 1858, the balance in the Senate was lost; a loss that was compounded by the subsequent admission of Oregon as a free state in 1859.\n\nBefore 1812, the concern about balancing slave-states and free states was not profound. This is how the states lined up in 1812. The year column is the year the state ratified the US Constitution or was admitted to the Union:\n\nAfter 1812, and until 1850, maintaining the balance of free and slave state votes in the Senate was considered of paramount importance if the Union were to be preserved, and states were typically admitted in pairs:\n\nThe balance was maintained until 1850:\nThe Civil War (1861-1865) disrupted and eventually ended slavery:\n\nDuring the Civil War, a Unionist government in Wheeling, Virginia, presented a statehood bill to Congress in order to create a new state from 48 counties in western Virginia. The new state would eventually incorporate 50 counties. The issue of slavery in the new state delayed approval of the bill. In the Senate Charles Sumner objected to the admission of a new slave state, while Benjamin Wade defended statehood as long as a gradual emancipation clause would be included in the new state constitution. Two senators represented the Unionist Virginia government, John S. Carlile and Waitman T. Willey. Senator Carlile objected that Congress had no right to impose emancipation on West Virginia, while Willey proposed a compromise amendment to the state constitution for gradual abolition. Sumner attempted to add his own amendment to the bill, which was defeated, and the statehood bill passed both houses of Congress with the addition of what became known as the Willey Amendment. President Lincoln signed the bill on December 31, 1862. Voters in western Virginia approved the Willey Amendment on March 26, 1863.\n\nPresident Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, which exempted from emancipation the border states (four slave states loyal to the Union) as well as some territories occupied by Union forces within Confederate states. Two additional counties were added to West Virginia in late 1863, Berkeley and Jefferson. The slaves in Berkeley were also under exemption but not those in Jefferson County. As of the census of 1860, the 49 exempted counties held some 6000 slaves over 21 years of age who would not have been emancipated, about 40% of the total slave population. The terms of the Willey Amendment only freed children, at birth or as they came of age, and prohibited the importation of slaves.\n\nWest Virginia became the 35th state on June 20, 1863, and the last slave state admitted to the Union. Eighteen months later, the West Virginia legislature completely abolished slavery, and also ratified the 13th Amendment on February 3, 1865.\n\nAt the start of the Civil War, there were 34 states in the United States, 15 of which were slave states. Eleven of these slave states issued various emergency declarations of secession from the United States to form the Confederacy and were represented in the Confederate Congress. The slave states that stayed in the Union, Maryland, Missouri, Delaware, and Kentucky (called, border states) were seated in the U.S. Congress. By the time the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863, Tennessee was already in Union control. Accordingly, the Proclamation applied only to the 10 remaining Confederate states. Abolition of slavery became a condition of the return of local rule and restoration in those states that had declared their secession.\n\nThe border states of Maryland (November 1864) and Missouri (January 1865),\none of the Confederate states, Tennessee (January 1865), and the new state of West Virginia (February 1865), abolished slavery just prior to the end of the Civil War (May 1865). In the District of Columbia, slavery was abolished in 1862. However, slavery persisted in Delaware, Kentucky, and 10 of the 11 of the former Confederate states, until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery throughout the United States on December 6, 1865, ending the distinction between slave and free states.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "202388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202388", "title": "Spear-thrower", "text": "Spear-thrower\n\nA spear-thrower or atlatl ( or ; ; ) is a tool that uses leverage to achieve greater velocity in dart-throwing, and includes a bearing surface which allows the user to store energy during the throw.\n\nIt may consist of a shaft with a cup or a spur at the end that supports and propels the butt of the dart. The spear-thrower is held in one hand, gripped near the end farthest from the cup. The dart is thrown by the action of the upper arm and wrist. The throwing arm together with the atlatl acts as a lever. The spear-thrower is a low-mass, fast-moving extension of the throwing arm, increasing the length of the lever. This extra length allows the thrower to impart force to the dart over a longer distance, thus imparting more energy and ultimately higher speeds.\n\nCommon modern ball throwers (molded plastic shafts used for throwing tennis balls for dogs to fetch) use the same principle.\n\nA spear-thrower is a long-range weapon and can readily impart to a projectile speeds of over .\n\nSpear-throwers appear very early in human history in several parts of the world, and have survived in use in traditional societies until the present day, as well as being revived in recent years for sporting purposes. In the United States the Nahuatl word \"atlatl\" is often used for revived uses of spear-throwers, and in Australia the Aboriginal word \"woomera\".\n\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans used a leather thong or loop, known as an \"ankule\" or \"amentum\", as a spear-throwing device.\n\nSpear-thrower designs may include improvements such as thong loops to fit the fingers, the use of flexible shafts, stone balance weights, and thinner, highly flexible darts for added power and range. Darts resemble large arrows or thin spears and are typically from in length and 9 to 16 mm (3/8\" to 5/8\") in diameter.\n\nAnother important improvement to the spear-thrower's design was the introduction of a small weight (between 60 and 80 grams) strapped to its midsection. Some atlatlists maintain that stone weights add mass to the shaft of the device, causing resistance to acceleration when swung and resulting in a more forceful and accurate launch of the dart. Others claim that spear-thrower weights add only stability to a cast, resulting in greater accuracy.\n\nBased on previous work done by William S. Webb, William R. Perkins claims that spear-thrower weights, commonly called \"bannerstones\", and characterized by a centered hole in a symmetrically shaped carved or ground stone, shaped wide and flat with a drilled hole and thus a little like a large wingnut, are a rather ingenious improvement to the design that created a silencing effect when swung. The use of the device would reduce the telltale \"zip\" of a swung atlatl to a more subtle \"woof\" sound that did not travel as far and was less likely to alert prey. Robert Berg's theory is that the bannerstone was carried by hunters as a spindle weight to produce string from natural fibers gathered while hunting, for the purpose of tying on fletching and hafting stone or bone points.\n\nThe woomera design is distinctly different from most other spear-throwers, in that it has a curved, hollow shape, which allows for it to be used for other purposes.\n\nSeveral Stone Age spear-throwers (usually now incomplete) are decorated with carvings of animals: the British Museum has a mammoth, and there is a hyena in France. Many pieces of decorated bone may have belonged to Bâtons de commandement.\n\nThe Aztec atlatl was often decorated with snake designs and feathers, potentially evocative of its association with Ehecatl, the Aztec wind deity.\n\nWooden darts were known at least since the Middle Paleolithic (Schöningen, Torralba, Clacton-on-Sea and Kalambo Falls). While the spear-thrower is capable of casting a dart well over one hundred meters, it is most accurately used at distances of twenty meters or less. The spearthrower is believed to have been in use by \"Homo sapiens\" since the Upper Paleolithic (around 30,000 years ago). Most stratified European finds come from the Magdalenian (late upper Palaeolithic). In this period, elaborate pieces, often in the form of animals, are common. The earliest secure data concerning atlatls have come from several caves in France dating to the Upper Paleolithic, about 21,000 to 17,000 years ago. The earliest known example is a 17,500-year-old Solutrean atlatl made of reindeer antler, found at Combe Saunière (Dordogne), France. It is possible that the atlatl was invented earlier than this, as Mungo Man from 42 000 BP displays arthritis in his right elbow, a pathology referred today as the \"Atlatl elbow,\" resulting from many years of forceful torsion from using an atlatl. At present there is no evidence for the use of atlatls in Africa. Peoples such as the Maasai and Khoi San throw spears without any aids, but its use in hunting is limited in comparison to the spear thrower since the animal must be very close and already immobile. \n\nIn Europe, the spear-thrower was supplemented by the bow and arrow in the Epi-Paleolithic. Along with improved ease of use, the bow offered the advantage that the bulk of elastic energy is stored in the throwing device, rather than the projectile; arrow shafts can therefore be much smaller, and have looser tolerances for spring constant and weight distribution than atlatl darts. This allowed for more forgiving flint knapping: dart heads designed for a particular spear thrower tend to differ in mass by only a few percent. By the Iron Age, the amentum, a strap attached to the shaft, was the standard European mechanism for throwing lighter javelins. The amentum gives not only range, but also spin to the projectile.\nThe spear-thrower was used by early Americans as well. It seems to have been introduced to America during the immigration across the Bering Land Bridge, and despite the later introduction of the bow and arrow, atlatl use was widespread at the time of first European contact. Complete wooden spear-throwers have been found on dry sites in the western United States and in waterlogged environments in Florida and Washington. Several Amazonian tribes also used the atlatl for fishing and hunting. Some even preferred this weapon over the bow and arrow, and used it not only in combat but also in sports competitions. Such was the case with the Tarairiu, a Tapuya tribe of migratory foragers and raiders inhabiting the forested mountains and highland savannahs of Rio Grande do Norte in mid-17th-century Brazil. Anthropologist Harald Prins offers the following description:\n\nThe atlatl, as used by these Tarairiu warriors, was unique in shape. About long and wide, this spear thrower was a tapering piece of wood carved of brown hard-wood. Well-polished, it was shaped with a semi-circular outer half and had a deep groove hollowed out to receive the end of the javelin, which could be engaged by a horizontal wooden peg or spur lashed with a cotton thread to the proximal and narrower end of the throwing board, where a few scarlet parrot feathers were tied for decoration. [Their] darts or javelins ... were probably made of a two-meter long wooden cane with a stone or long and serrated hard-wood point, sometimes tipped with poison. Equipped with their uniquely grooved atlatl, they could hurl their long darts from a great distance with accuracy, speed, and such deadly force that these easily pierced through the protective armor of the Portuguese or any other enemy.\n\nAmong the Tlingit of Southeast Alaska, approximately one dozen very old elaborately carved specimens they call \"shee áan\" (sitting on a branch) remain in museum collections and private collections, one having sold at auction for more than $100,000.\n\nIn September 1997, a atlatl dart fragment, carbon dated to 4360 ± 50 14C yr BP (TO 6870), was found in an ice patch on mountain Thandlät, the first of the southern Yukon Ice Patches to be studied.\n\nThe people of New Guinea and Australian Aborigines also use spear-throwers. In the mid Holocene, Australians developed spear-throwers, known as \"woomeras\".\n\nAs well as its practical use as a hunting weapon, it may also have had social effects. John Whittaker, an anthropologist at Grinnell College, Iowa, suggests the device was a social equalizer in that it requires skill rather than muscle power alone. Thus women and children would have been able to participate in hunting, although in recent Australian societies, spear-throwers are restricted by custom to male use.\n\nWhittaker said the stone-tipped projectiles from the Aztec atlatl were not powerful enough to penetrate Spanish steel plate armor, but they were strong enough to penetrate the mail, leather and cotton armor that most Spanish soldiers wore. Whittaker said the Aztecs started their battles with atlatl darts followed with melee combat using the macuahuitl.\nAnother type of Stone Age artefact that is sometimes excavated is the . These are shorter, normally less than one foot long, and made of antler, with a hole drilled through them. When first found in the nineteenth century, they were interpreted by French archaeologists to be symbols of authority, like a modern Field Marshal's baton, and so named (\"batons of command\"). Though debate over their function continues, tests with replicas have found them, when used with a cord, very effective aids to spear or dart throwing. Another theory is that they were \"arrow-straighteners\".\n\nIn modern times, some people have resurrected the dart thrower for sports, often using the term atlatl, throwing either for distance and/or for accuracy. The World Atlatl Association was formed in 1987 to promote the atlatl. Throws of almost have been recorded. Colleges reported to field teams in this event include Grinnell College in Iowa, Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire, Alfred University in New York, and the University of Vermont.\n\nAtlatls are sometimes used in modern times for hunting. In the U.S., the Pennsylvania Game Commission has given preliminary approval for legalization of the atlatl for hunting certain animals. The animals that would be allowed to atlatl hunters have yet to be determined, but particular consideration has been given to deer. Currently, Alabama allows the atlatl for deer hunting, while a handful of other states list the device as legal for rough fish (those not sought for sport or food), some game birds and non-game mammals. Starting in 2007, Missouri allowed use of the atlatl for hunting wildlife (excluding deer and turkey), and starting in 2010, also allowed deer hunting during the firearms portion of the deer season (except the muzzleloader portion). Starting in 2012, Missouri allowed the use of atlatls during the fall archery deer and turkey hunting seasons and, starting in 2014, allowed the use of atlatls during the spring turkey hunting season as well. Missouri also allows use of the atlatl for fishing, with some restrictions (similar to the restrictions for spearfishing and bowfishing). The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission allows the use of atlatls for the taking of deer .\n\nThe woomera is still used today by some Australian Aborigines for hunting in remote parts of Australia. Yup'ik Eskimo hunters still use the atlatl, known locally as \"nuqaq\" (nook-ak), in villages near the mouth of the Yukon River for seal hunting.\n\nThere are numerous atlatl competitions held every year, with spears and spear-throwers built using both ancient and modern materials. Events are often held at parks, such as Letchworth State Park in New York, Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in Illinois, or Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada. Atlatl associations around the world host a number of local atlatl competitions. Chimney Point State Historic Site in Addison, Vermont hosts the annual Northeast Open Atlatl Championship. In 2009, the Fourteenth Annual Open Atlatl Championship was held on Saturday and Sunday, September 19 and 20. On the Friday before the Championship, a workshop was held to teach modern and traditional techniques of atlatl and dart construction, flint knapping, hafting stone points, and cordage making. Competitions may be held in conjunction with other events, such as the Ohio Pawpaw Festival, or at the Bois D'Arc Primitive Skills Gathering and Knap-in, held every September in southern Missouri.\n\nAtlatl events commonly include the International Standard Accuracy Competition (ISAC), in which contestants throw ten times at a bull's-eye target. Other contests involving different distances or terrain may also be included, usually testing the atlatlist's accuracy rather than distance throwing.\n\nIn the sixth episode of the fourth season of the television competition \"Top Shot\", the elimination round consisted of two contestants using the atlatl at ranges of 30, 45 and 60 feet.\n\n\n"}

Playwright Arthur Miller uses the term in his play \"The Last Yankee\" to refer to a New England carpenter who was a descendant of one of the Founding Fathers. Rhode Island cartoonist Don Bousquet often parodies the Swamp Yankee in his cartoons. Kerry W. Buckley describes President Calvin Coolidge as a swamp Yankee in a 2003 article in \"New England Quarterly\", defining it as the \"scion of an old family that was no longer elite or monied\". \"The term swamp Yankee is becoming less known and may be unknown in a few generations…. Probably the best reason for its disappearance is the vanishing of the swamp Yankee himself as society moves toward urban and suburban life.\"\n\nThe town of Richmond, Rhode Island sponsors a festival every September named \"Swamp Yankee Days\". It features traditional fare such as clam chowder, clamcakes, and johnnycakes. Various local bands play during the event, and activities include an antique tractor parade, a baked bean eating contest, cow chip bingo, a flea market, and assorted activities for children.\n\nThe origin of the term \"Swamp Yankee\" is unclear. The term \"Yankee\" originated in the mid-17th century, but the variation \"Swamp Yankee\" is not attested until the 20th century, according to . Several theories speculate that \"Swamp Yankees\" were the undesirable, troublemaking New Englanders who moved to the \"swamps\" of southeastern New England upon arriving in the New World in the 17th century. It is possible that the term also meant that a person was unwanted in an unestablished town for having a relationship with an Indian. Others speculate that the original \"Swamp Yankees\" were colonial-era indentured servants who were paid for their service with swamp land from the farmers to whom they were indentured. Still others claim that \"Swamp Yankees\" had relatives who fought in the Great Swamp Fight of King Philip's War.\n\nAnother theory claims that the term originated during the American Revolution when residents of Thompson, Connecticut fled to the surrounding swamps to escape a feared British invasion in 1776. When the refugees arose from the swamps several weeks later, they were ridiculed and called \"Swamp Yankees\".\n\nA 1912 \"Metropolitan Magazine\" article describes the son of a New England mill owner as a \"Swamp Yankee\". In 1921, Modern Connecticut Homes and Homecrafts describes a \"swamp yankee\" living in an old unpainted home in New England but caring about his beds of flowers. A bowling team in a 1922 Norwich, Connecticut newspaper was named the \"Swamp Yankees\". In 1935, the \"New York Times\" labeled \"Swamp Yankees\" as those driven out of a New England mill town by immigrants.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42635664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42635664", "title": "Symbolism in the French Revolution", "text": "Symbolism in the French Revolution\n\nSymbolism in the French Revolution was a device to distinguish and celebrate (or vilify) the main features of the French Revolution and ensure public identification and support. In order to effectively illustrate the differences between the new Republic and the old regime, the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbolism. To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instill in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.\n\nFasces, like many other symbols of the French Revolution, are Roman in origin. Fasces are a bundle of birch rods containing an axe. In Roman times, the fasces symbolized the power of magistrates, representing union and accord with the Roman Republic. The French Republic continued this Roman symbol to represent state power, justice, and unity.\nDuring the Revolution, the fasces image was often used in conjunction with many other symbols. Though seen throughout the French Revolution, perhaps the most well known French reincarnation of the fasces is the Fasces surmounted by a Phrygian cap. This image has no display of an axe or a strong central state; rather, it symbolizes the power of the liberated people by placing the Liberty Cap on top of the classical symbol of power.\n\nCockades were widely worn by revolutionaries beginning in 1789. They now pinned the blue-and-red cockade of Paris onto the white cockade of the \"Ancien Régime\" - thus producing the original \"Tricolore\" cockade. Later, distinctive colours and styles of cockade would indicate the wearer's faction—although the meanings of the various styles were not entirely consistent, and varied somewhat by region and period.\nThe tricolore flag is derived from the cockades used in the 1790s. These were circular rosette-like emblems attached to the hat. Camille Desmoulins asked his followers to wear green cockades on 12 July 1789. The Paris militia, formed on 13 July, adopted a blue and red cockade. Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, and they are used on the city's coat of arms. Cockades with various colour schemes were used during the storming of the Bastille on 14 July. The blue and red cockade was presented to King Louis XVI at the Hôtel de Ville on 17 July. Lafayette argued for the addition of a white stripe to \"nationalise\" the design. On 27 July, a tricolore cockade was adopted as part of the uniform of the National Guard, the national police force that succeeded the militia.\n\nThe Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, a militant group on the far left, demanded a law in 1793 that would compel all women to wear the tricolore cockade to demonstrate their loyalty to the Republic. The law was passed but was violently opposed by other groups of women. The Jacobins in charge of the government decided that women had no place in public affairs, and disbanded all women's organizations in October 1793.\n\nIn revolutionary France, the cap or \"\" was first seen publicly in May 1790, at a festival in Troyes adorning a statue representing the nation, and at Lyon, on a lance carried by the goddess Libertas. To this day the national emblem of France, Marianne, is shown wearing a Phrygian cap. The caps were often knitted by women known as Tricoteuse who sat beside the guillotine during public executions in Paris in the French Revolution, supposedly continuing to knit in between executions.\nThe Liberty cap, also known as the Phrygian cap, or pileus, is a brimless, felt cap that is conical in shape with the tip pulled forward. The cap was originally worn by ancient Romans and Greeks. The cap implies ennobling effects, as seen in its association with Homer's Ulysses and the mythical twins, Castor and Pollux. The emblem's popularity during the French Revolution is due in part to its importance in ancient Rome: its use alludes to the Roman ritual of manumission of slaves, in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty. The Roman tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus incited the slaves to insurrection by displaying a pileus as if it were a standard.\n\nThe pileus cap is often red in color. This type of cap was worn by revolutionaries at the fall of the Bastille. According to the Revolutions de Paris, it became \"the symbol of the liberation from all servitudes, the sign for unification of all the enemies of despotism.\" The pileus competed with the Phrygian cap, a similar cap that covered the ears and the nape of the neck, for popularity. The Phrygian cap eventually supplanted the pileus and usurped its symbolism, becoming synonymous with republican liberty.\n\nAs the radicals and Jacobins became more powerful, there was a revulsion against high-fashion because of its extravagance and its association with royalty and aristocracy. It was replaced with a sort of \"anti-fashion\" for men and women that emphasized simplicity and modesty. The men wore plain, dark clothing and short unpowdered hair. During the Terror of 1794, the workaday outfits of the sans-culottes symbolized Jacobin egalitarianism. High fashion and extravagance returned under the Directory, 1795–99, with its \"directoire\" styles; the men did not return to extravagant customs.\n\nThe Liberty Tree, officially adopted in 1792, is a symbol of the everlasting Republic, national freedom, and political revolution. It has historic roots in revolutionary France as well as America, as a symbol that was shared by the two nascent republics. The tree was chosen as a symbol of the French Revolution because it symbolizes fertility in French folklore, which provided a simple transition from revering it for one reason to another. The American colonies also used the idea of a Liberty Tree to celebrate their own acts of insurrection against the British, starting with the Stamp Act riot in 1765.\n\nThe riot culminated in the hanging in effigy of two Stamp Act politicians on a large elm tree. The elm tree began to be celebrated as a symbol of Liberty in the American colonies. It was adopted as a symbol that needed to be living and growing, along with the Republic. To that end, the tree is portrayed as a sapling, usually of an oak tree in French interpretation. The Liberty Tree serves as a constant celebration of the spirit of political freedom.\n\nThe symbol of Hercules was first adopted by the Old Regime to represent the monarchy. Hercules was an ancient Greek hero who symbolized strength and power. The symbol was used to represent the sovereign authority of the King over France during the reign of the Bourbon monarchs. However, the monarchy was not the only ruling power in French history to use the symbol of Hercules to declare its power.\n\nDuring the Revolution, the symbol of Hercules was revived to represent nascent revolutionary ideals. The first use of Hercules as a revolutionary symbol was during a festival celebrating the National Assembly's victory over federalism on 10 August 1793. \"Federalism\" was a movement to weaken the central government. This Festival of Unity consisted of four stations around Paris which featured symbols representing major events of the Revolution which embodied revolutionary ideals of liberty, unity, and power.\n\nThe statue of Hercules, placed at the station commemorating the fall of Louis XVI, symbolized the power of the French people over their former oppressors. The statue's foot was placed on the throat of the Hydra, which represented the tyranny of federalism which the new Republic had vanquished. In one hand, the statue grasped a club, a symbol of power, while in the other grasping the fasces which symbolized the unity of the French people. The image of Hercules assisted the new Republic in establishing its new Republican moral system. Hercules thus evolved from a symbol of the sovereignty of the monarch into a symbol of the new sovereign authority in France: the French people.\n\nThis transition was made easily for two reasons. First, because Hercules was a famous mythological figure, and had previously been used by the monarchy, he was easily recognized by educated French observers. It was not necessary for the revolutionary government to educate the French people on the background of the symbol. Additionally, Hercules recalled the classical age of the Greeks and the Romans, a period which the revolutionaries identified with republican and democratic ideals. These connotations made Hercules an easy choice to represent the powerful new sovereign people of France.\n\nDuring the more radical phase of the Revolution from 1793 to 1794, the usage and depiction of Hercules changed. These changes to the symbol were due to revolutionary leaders believing the symbol was inciting violence among the common citizens. The triumphant battles of Hercules and the overcoming of enemies of the Republic became less prominent. In discussions over what symbol to use for the Seal of the Republic, the image of Hercules was considered but eventually ruled out in favor of Marianne.\n\nHercules was on the coin of the Republic. However, this Hercules was not the same image as that of the pre-Terror phases of the Revolution. The new image of Hercules was more domesticated. He appeared more paternal, older, and wiser, rather than the warrior-like images in the early stages of the French Revolution. Unlike his 24-foot statue in the Festival of the Supreme Being, he was now the same size as Liberty and Equality.\n\nAlso the language on the coin with Hercules was very different from the rhetoric of pre-revolutionary depictions. On the coins the words, \"uniting Liberty and Equality\" were used. This is opposed to the forceful language of early Revolutionary rhetoric and rhetoric of the Bourbon monarchy. By 1798, the Council of Ancients had discussed the \"inevitable\" change from the problematic image of Hercules, and Hercules was eventually phased out in favor of an even more docile image.\n\n\"La Marseillaise\" () became the national anthem of France. The song was written and composed in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle, and was originally titled \"Chant de guerre pour l'Armée du Rhin\". The French National Convention adopted it as the First Republic's anthem in 1795. It acquired its nickname after being sung in Paris by volunteers from Marseille marching on the capital.\n\nThe song is the first example of the \"European march\" anthemic style. The anthem's evocative melody and lyrics have led to its widespread use as a song of revolution and its incorporation into many pieces of classical and popular music. Cerulo says, \"the design of \"La Marseillaise\" is credited to General Strasburg of France, who is said\nto have directed de Lisle, the composer of the anthem, to 'produce one of those hymns which conveys to the soul of the people the enthusiasm which it (the music) suggests.'\"\n\nHanson notes, \"The guillotine stands as the principal symbol of the Terror in the French Revolution.\" Invented by a physician during the Revolution as a quicker, more efficient and more distinctive form of execution, the guillotine became a part of popular culture and historic memory. It was celebrated on the left as the people's avenger and cursed as the symbol of the Reign of Terror by the right. Its operation became a popular entertainment that attracted great crowds of spectators. Vendors sold programs listing the names of those scheduled to die. Many people came day after day and vied for the best locations from which to observe the proceedings; knitting women (tricoteuses) formed a cadre of hardcore regulars, inciting the crowd. Parents often brought their children. By the end of the Terror, the crowds had thinned drastically. Repetition had staled even this most grisly of entertainments, and audiences grew bored.\n\nWhat it is that horrifies people changes over time. Doyle comments:\n\n"}

For a series of 54 specials and shows, Martin and his friends would \"roast\" a celebrity. The roasts were patterned after the roasts held at the New York Friars' Club.\n\nIn 1973, \"The Dean Martin Show\" was declining in popularity. In its final season, to pick up the ratings and to require less of Martin's involvement, it was retooled into a series of celebrity roasts by adding a feature called \"Man of the Week Celebrity Roast\" . The roasts seemed to be popular among television audiences and are often marketed in post-issues as part of the official \"Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts\" and not \"The Dean Martin Show\". After \"The Dean Martin Show\" was cancelled in 1974, NBC drew up a contract with Martin to do several specials and do more roast specials. Starting with Bob Hope in 1974, the roast was taped in California and turned out to be a hit, leading to many other roasts to follow.\n\nIn the fall of 1974, the roasts moved permanently to the MGM Grand Hotel's Ziegfeld Room in Las Vegas and mainly aired Thursdays on NBC. The televised roasts were popular in the ratings; however Martin and NBC declined to extend the 10-year contract. Some segments were taped prior to or after the roast, due to considerations with the performer or technical aspects. No roasts were broadcast between 1980 and 1983 (partly due to the MGM Grand fire of 1980), with the specials returning for a few final installments in 1984. The show's official title as a television special would change based on the celebrity, in James Stewart's case for instance, it would be the \"Dean Martin Celebrity Roast: Jimmy Stewart\".\n\nThe roastmaster (Martin), the roastee, and the roasters would be seated on a dais. The roastees were also referred to as \"Man of the Hour\", \"Woman of the Hour\", or \"Man of the Week\" in earlier episodes.\n\nIn two instances, a pair of celebrities were roasted at the same time: Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, and Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. Only one person was honored posthumously, George Washington, who was honored for the upcoming United States bicentennial (veteran historical impersonator Jan Leighton portrayed Washington for the episode while Audrey Meadows portrayed his wife, Martha). Michael Landon, Redd Foxx, Joe Namath, and Jack Klugman were the only celebrities roasted twice; Landon's second time in 1984, being the final roast. Don Rickles hosted the roast of Dean Martin and assumed the role of Roastmaster. Comedian Nipsey Russell and impressionist Rich Little appeared the most often on the roast with each appearing 24 times. While most of the participants were comedians known for their work in such events, occasionally unexpected participants would be featured, such as British pop singer Petula Clark who was recruited to help roast TV actor William Conrad in 1973.\n\n\"The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts\" were released on DVD through Guthy-Renker with some of \"The Dean Martin Show\" roasts selected as part of the package. The show is one of the most sold video sets of all-time. NBC Universal brought suit against producer Greg Garrison and Guthy-Renker for selling \"The Dean Martin Show\" DVDs; the suit did not affect the \"Celebrity Roasts\". All 54 of the \"Celebrity Roasts\" are now being sold via television infomercial by Time–Life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The first anime series was licensed by Geneon Entertainment in English, but the license expired in 2011. Sentai Filmworks has since re-licensed and re-released the first series and released the other three series in North America. A manga version drawn by Nana Mochizuki was serialized in Media Factory's manga magazine \"Monthly Comic Alive\" between August 2006 and October 2009. The manga was released by Seven Seas Entertainment in North America. Three additional spin-off manga were also created, as were three visual novels.\n\nLouise is a noble girl who is terrible at magic, as her attempts usually result in an explosion. She is nicknamed \"Louise the Zero\" by her classmates, due to the inability to use any of the four magic elements. Early in the school year at the Tristain Academy of Magic, the second year students perform a special ritual where they summon their familiar, which serves as their eternal protector and partner, and is usually some sort of magical creature. But Louise summons Saito Hiraga, an ordinary teenage boy from Japan, leaving her totally humiliated.\n\nDue to the sacredness of the ritual, Louise reluctantly accepts Saito as her familiar, but proceeds to treat Saito as any other familiar, only worse, making him wash her clothes, sleep on a bed of hay, and whipping him with a riding crop when he upsets her. \"The Familiar of Zero\" follows the adventures of Louise and Saito as they help their classmates and friends, while occasionally blundering into situations where they risk their lives to save one another. Saito tries to find a way to get back to Japan, but he also has a mysterious power that allows him to wield swords and other weapons to perform heroic feats. They also eventually learn the truth behind Louise's magic inabilities. As Saito's and Louise's friendship grows and they start to work together, they ultimately fall in love with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Familiar of Zero\" began as a series of light novels written by Noboru Yamaguchi and illustrated by Eiji Usatsuka under the original title \"Zero no Tsukaima\". Media Factory published 20 volumes in Japan between June 25, 2004 and February 25, 2011. Further publication was threatened by Yamaguchi's advanced cancer, which he succumbed to on April 4, 2013, leaving the series unfinished. Yamaguchi had planned the series to end with 22 volumes. However, it was later decided by the publisher to continue the series in the author's absence, due in part to calls from fans to continue the series, as well as Yamaguchi's family wanting to see it completed. Yamaguchi had dictated the remaining plot of the series, including its ending, and entrusted it to the editors. Media Factory released volume 21 on February 25, 2016 and the final volume 22 on February 24, 2017. Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the series in 2007 under the title \"Zero's Familiar\", but later cancelled the release of the novels.\n\nA side-story, \"Zero no Tsukaima Gaiden: Tabatha no Bōken\", initially available as a mobile phone online serial, was released in three volumes between October 25, 2006 and March 25, 2009. It centers on the adventures of the character Tabitha, Louise's classmate. Another side story, \"Kaze no Kishihime\", was released in two volumes on October 23, 2009 and March 25, 2010. It is a prequel about Louise's mother youth. A companion volume, \"Zero no Tsukaima Memorial Book\", was released on June 24, 2017. It collected various short stories and illustrations previously unpublished in book format, as well as character designs and other information, such as outlines for volumes 21 and 22 left behind by Yamaguchi. It also revealed that the last two volumes of the series were written by Yū Shimizu, author of \"Bladedance of Elementalers\", using Yamaguchi's notes.\n\n\"The Familiar of Zero\" has been adapted into an anime series running for four seasons by the animation studio J.C.Staff. The first season aired in Japan between July 3 and September 25, 2006, and contained thirteen episodes. In April 2007 at Anime Boston, Geneon announced that they had picked up the English dubbing rights of the first season of the anime series under the title \"The Familiar of Zero\". In July 2008, Geneon Entertainment and Funimation Entertainment announced an agreement to distribute select titles in North America. While Geneon Entertainment still retained the license, Funimation Entertainment assumed exclusive rights to the manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of select titles. \"The Familiar of Zero\" was one of several titles involved in the deal. Funimation released a complete box set of the series on November 4, 2008. Funimation reported their rights to the series expired in August 2011.

It is thought to be a portrait of Wolfgang Lazius, a humanist and historian who served Holy Roman Emperors of the House of Habsburg.\n\nArcimboldo became official portraitist to Emperor Ferdinand I in 1562 and later to Maximilian II and Rudolf II. \"The Librarian\" is one of a series of paintings by Arcimboldo of members of Maximilian's entourage. Skokloster Castle dates the painting to 1562, though the painting is more often dated circa 1566.\n\nArcimboldo created a number of portraits of people by painting an assemblage of objects such as fruits and vegetables, flowers, or in this case, books; the objects typically had some connection to the person's life or depiction. Benno Geiger called it a \"triumph of abstract art in the 16th century\". In 1957, art historian Sven Alfons was the first to conclude that this was specifically a portrait of Lazius. The work has been interpreted as both a celebration and a satirical mocking of librarians and scholarship. K. C. Elhard suggests that it may be specifically a parody of \"materialistic book collectors more interested in acquiring books than in reading them.\"\n\nElhard notes that \"The Librarian\" has become \"a fixture in the visual history of the library profession\". However, the original title, if any, is unknown, and its current title first appears (in Swedish as \"Bibliotekarien\") in an early 20th-century inventory.\n\n\"The Librarian\" is one of two works by Arcimbolodo in the collection of Skokloster Castle. The painting was brought to Sweden following the looting of Prague Castle by the Swedish army during the 1648 Battle of Prague and was owned by General Hans Christoff von Königsmarck.\n\nThere are three other extant versions of the painting whose attributions are uncertain. A scientific study published in 2011 concluded that \"The Librarian\" was a later copy of Arcimbolodo's original painting, whose whereabouts are unknown.\n\n"}
{"id": "26279550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26279550", "title": "Theological veto", "text": "Theological veto\n\nThe theological veto is the concept in philosophy of religion that philosophy and logic are impious and that God, not reason, is sovereign. This concept is held as true by some theists, especially religious fundamentalists.\n\nThe idea is derived from a belief that mankind is depraved, and its intellect is a flawed product of this fallenness. In this view conversion, not reason, is the way to the truth; preaching, not argument, is the way to persuade; and grace, not evidence is the way belief is confirmed. In this view, natural reason is so profoundly hostile to the divine that holding it above faith is tantamount to worshiping a sinful creature as an idol. Even the use of reason on behalf of faith is rejected under the theological veto, as it shows faithlessness. It presupposes by practice that faith can be benefited by reason.\n\nAn early use of the phrase is reported from a 1925 critique of opponents of evolution: \"They meet the accumulating evidences of the descent of man with a theological veto. They set the limit to science by the quotation of a verse from the creation legend \"Genesis.\"\"\n\nThere are several reasons put forth by those who reject the theological veto. One way to reject the theological veto is to assert that one cannot isolate reason from faith. Intelligible use of language is claimed to commit one to consistency, so to reject reason is to refuse to make sense. This argument asserts that even the theological veto itself must be consistent with itself and inconsistent with reason. Another way the theological veto is rejected is to assert that rejection of critical control over one's beliefs, as for instance by the requirement of evidence, lowers the barrier against bigotry, fanaticism, and persecution. While its high aspiration is to warn against human pride, some say its supporters are guilty of what they themselves claim is the highest form of pride: They claim that they know the mind of God.\n\n"}

{"id": "32351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32351", "title": "Verlan", "text": "Verlan\n\nVerlan () is an argot in the French language, featuring inversion of syllables in a word, and is common in slang and youth language. It rests on a long French tradition of transposing syllables of individual words to create slang words. The name \"verlan\" is an example: it is derived from inverting the sounds of the syllables in \"l'envers\" (, \"the inverse\", frequently used in the sense of \"back-to-front\").\n\nWords in \"verlan\" are formed by switching the order in which syllables from the original word are pronounced. For example, \"français\" becomes \"céfran\" .\n\n\"Verlan\" generally retains the pronunciation of the original syllables. In particular, French words that end in a \"⟨e⟩ muet\" (such as \"femme\") and words that end in a pronounced consonant and which usually have an \"⟨e⟩ muet\" added at the end (such as \"flic\") retain the sound of the \"⟨e⟩ muet\" in \"verlan\". In addition, \"verlan\" often drops the final vowel sound after the word is inverted, so \"femme\" and \"flic\" become \"meuf\" and \"keuf,\" respectively.\n\nDifferent rules apply for one-syllable words, and words with multiple syllables may be verlanised in more than one way. For example, \"cigarette\" may yield \"garetsi\" or \"retsiga\".\n\nSome \"verlan\" words, such as \"meuf\", have become so commonplace that they have been included in the \"Petit Larousse\" and a doubly \"verlanised\" version was deemed necessary, so the singly verlanised \"meuf\" became \"feumeu\"; similarly, the \"verlan\" word \"beur\", derived from \"arabe\", has become accepted into popular culture such that it has been re-verlanised to yield \"rebeu\".\n\nSome verlan words, which are now well incorporated in common French language, have taken on their own significance, or at least certain connotations that have changed their meaning. For example, the word \"meuf\", which can still be used to refer to any woman, also refers to the speaker's girlfriend, when used in the possessive form (\"ma meuf\" → my girl); while the original word \"femme\" would refer to the speaker's wife when used in the same way (\"ma femme\" → my wife). Such words retain a cultural significance from the time at which they appeared in common language. Widely spread in the second half of the 20th century, \"beur\" generally refers to first-generation immigrants from northern Africa in France. The re-verlanised word \"rebeu\" is much more recent, and is used to refer rather to second-generation Arab immigrants in France, and their social attitude.\n\nIn theory, any word can be translated into \"verlan\", but only a few expressions are used in everyday speech. Verbs translated into \"verlan\" cannot be conjugated easily. There is no such thing as a \"verlan\" grammar, so generally verbs are used in the infinitive, past participle or progressive form. For example:\n\nThe study of written \"verlan\" is difficult as it is primarily passed down orally, without standardized spelling. While some still argue that the letters should be held over from the original word, in the case of \"verlan\", most experts agree that words should be spelled as to best approximate pronunciation. \"Verlan\" is preferred to \"versl'en\".\nThe French author Auguste Le Breton uses numerous examples of \"verlan\", for instance in \"Du rififi chez les hommes\".\n\n\"Verlan\" is less a language than a way to set apart certain words. Many verlan words refer either to sex or drugs, related to the original purpose of keeping communication secret from institutions of social control. \"Verlan\" is generally limited to one or two key words per sentence. \"Verlan\" words and expressions are mixed within a more general \"argotique\" language.\n\n\"Verlan\" is used by people to mark their membership in, or exclusion from, a particular group (generally young people in the cities and \"banlieues\", although some French upper-class youth have also started using it as their slang); it is a tool for marking and delineating group identity. Speakers rarely create a \"verlan\" word on the fly; rather, their ability to use and understand words from an accepted set of known \"verlan\" terms allows them to be identified as part of a \"verlan\"-speaking group. Lefkowitz claims that the best speakers of the language are often the worst students, those most needing to hide from authority.\n\nSome \"verlan\" words have gained mainstream currency. Examples of \"verlan\" in cultural mainstream include the 1984 comedy \"Les Ripoux\" (\"My New Partner\") (\"ripou\" is verlan for \"pourri\", or rotten, and refers to a corrupt policeman); and the 1977 hit \"Laisse béton\" by singer Renaud (\"béton\" is \"verlan\" for \"tomber\" and the phrase means \"drop it\").\n\n\"Verlan\" is popular as a form of expression in French hip-hop. Artists claim that it fits well with the musical medium because \"form ranks way over substance\".\n\nThe stage name of Belgian pop artist and songwriter Stromae (real name Paul Van Haver) is \"verlan\" for \"maestro\".\n\n\"Voltaire\", the nom-de-plume of François-Marie Arouet, is possibly a \"verlan\" word for Airvault.\n\n"}

The town proper has approximately 3100 inhabitants. The municipality population in 2011 was 11,772, in an area of .\n\nThe name \"Óbidos\" is a Latinised (oppidum, citadel) derivation of the older Celtic \"Eburobricio\". The municipality had its growth from a Roman settlement near the foothills of an elevated escarpment. The region of Óbidos, extending from the Atlantic to the interior of Estremadura Province along the rivers and lakes has been inhabited since the late Paleolithic. A settlement was constructed by early Celt tribes, that was later a centre of trade for the Phoenicians. Archeological evidence from the base of the medieval tower (south of Facho) at Óbidos Castle indicates Roman construction linked to an outpost of the Roman civitas of \"Eburobrittium\", a large urban area that has been under excavation. Archeological surveys determined the remains of a forum, baths and other Roman structures near the settlement.\n\nAfter the fall of Rome, the region came under the influence of the Visigoths, although specific records are missing. The Roman town of \"Eburobrittium\" was abandoned in the 5th century for the more secure hilltop where today the principal settlement is located. Sometime after 713 the Moors established a fortification on this mountain, while a Christian community of Mozarabs lived in the \"Moncharro\" neighbourhood.\n\nThe area was taken from the Moors by the first King of Portugal, Afonso Henriques, in 1148. Tradition states that one knight, Gonçalo Mendes da Maia, was responsible for the successful storming of the Moorish castle. The retaking of Óbidos was a final stage in the conquest of the Estremadura Province region, after the settlements of Santarém, Lisbon and Torres Vedras. Following the control of the region, the settlement received its first \"foral\" (charter) in 1195, during the reign of King Sancho I. In 1210, King Afonso II gave the title of this village to Queen Urraca. Since then, Óbidos has often been patronized by the Queens of Portugal, giving rise to its informal title as \"Vila das Rainhas\" (); several royal consorts enriched the village with donations from the Middle Ages until the 16th century.\n\nThe castle and walls of Óbidos were remodelled during the reign of King Dinis I. The limestone and marble structure was strengthened and elaborated, while the keep was created in the 14th century, by King Fernando. By the time of the first remodelling project, the settlement had also grown beyond the gates of the castle.\n\nThe Church of Santa Maria in Óbidos was the setting for the wedding of King Afonso V to his cousin, Princess Isabella of Coimbra, on 15 August 1441, when they were both still children aged 9 and 10, respectively. Administrative reforms conducted by King Manuel I at Óbidos in 1513, included the institution of a formal charter and major requalification of the urban area.\n\nThe 1755 earthquake caused damage to the village walls, a few churches, and many buildings, and resulted in the loss of architecture of Arab or Medieval inspiration. Similarly, the Peninsular Wars were fought in the vicinity of Óbidos, including the Battle of Roliça. More recently, the village was a centre of government and meeting place for those involved in the 1974 Carnation Revolution, linking it to the armed forces movement revolt.\n\nLocated on the Atlantic Ocean coast, the municipality is bounded in the northeast and east by Caldas da Rainha, in the south by Bombarral, in the southeast by Lourinhã and in the west by Peniche. Administratively, it is divided into 7 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\n\nThe area of the town of Óbidos is located on a hilltop, encircled by a fortified wall. Óbidos remains a well-preserved example of medieval architecture; its streets, squares, walls and its castle are a popular tourist destination. The castle now houses a pousada. The municipality is also home to the famous Praia D'el Rey golf complex, one of the top golf resorts in Europe, and Royal Óbidos - Spa & Golf Resort.\n\nEach July Óbidos castle hosts a traditional 'Medieval Market'. For two weeks the castle and the surrounding town recreate the spirit of medieval Europe.\n\nFlowing banners and heraldic flags set the mood together with hundreds of entertainers and stall holders dressed as merchants, jugglers, jesters, wandering minstrels, soldiers and more. Visitors can shop at the traditional handcrafts fair or watch medieval shows, horse displays and a costumed parade that winds its way through the streets. There are also displays of jousting knights and armed combat.\n\nSpit roasted hog, hearty soups, rabbit, lamb, cod, quail, sausages and other grilled meats are just some of the many medieval style meals on offer from dozens of \"taverns\" and stalls spread throughout the market. Drinking from pewter tankards and eating from wooden trencher all adds to the experience.\n\n\n"}
