{"id": "140270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140270", "title": "African-American English", "text": "African-American English\n\nAfrican-American English (AAE), also known as Black English in North American linguistics, is the set of English dialects primarily spoken by most black people in North America; most commonly, it refers to a dialect continuum ranging from African-American Vernacular English to a more standard English. African-American English shows variation such as in vernacular versus standard forms, rural versus urban characteristics, features specific to singular cities or regions only, and other sociolinguistic criteria. There has also been a significant body of African-American literature and oral tradition for centuries.\n\nAfrican-American English began as early as the seventeenth century, when the Atlantic slave trade brought African slaves into the majority-white culture of British-colonial North America in an area that became the Southern United States in the late eighteenth century. During the development of plantation culture in this region, nonstandard dialects of English were widely spoken by British settlers, as well as likely some creolized varieties, probably resulting in both first- and second-language English varieties developed by African Americans. The nineteenth century's evolving cotton-plantation industry, and eventually the twentieth century's Great Migration, certainly contributed greatly to the spread of the first of these varieties as stable dialects of English. The most widespread modern dialect is known as African-American Vernacular English.\n\nAfrican-American Vernacular (AAVE) is the native variety of the vast majority of working- and middle-class African Americans, particularly in urban areas, with its own unique accent, grammar, and vocabulary features. Typical features of the grammar include a \"zero\" copula (e.g., \"she my sister\" instead of \"she's my sister\"), simplification of the possessive form (e.g., \"my momma friend\" instead of \"my mom's friend\"), and complexification of verb aspects and tenses beyond those of other English dialects (e.g., constructions like \"I'm a-run\", \"I be running\", \"I been runnin\", \"I done ran\", etc.). Common features of the phonology include non-rhoticity (dropping the \"r\" sound at the end of syllables), the metathetic use of \"aks\" instead of \"ask\", simplification of diphthongs (e.g., \"eye\" typically sounds like \"ah\"), a raising chain shift of the front vowels, and a wider range of intonation or \"melody\" patterns than most General American accents. AAVE is used by middle-class African Americans in casual, intimate, and informal settings as one end of a sociocultural language continuum, and AAVE shows some slight variations by region or city.\n\nAfrican-American Standard English is the prestigious end of the middle-class African-American language continuum, used for more formal, careful, or public settings than AAVE. This variety exhibits standard English vocabulary and grammar but often retains certain elements of the unique AAVE accent, with intonational or rhythmic features maintained more than phonological ones. Most middle-class African Americans are typically bi-dialectal between this standard variety and AAVE, learning the former variety through schooling, so that adults will frequently even codeswitch between the two varieties within a single conversation. Of the phonological features maintained in this standard dialect, they tend to be less marked features that, for instance, even appear in some white standard dialects of English. One such characteristic is the omission of the final consonant in word-final consonant clusters, so words such as \"past\" or \"hand\" may lose their final consonant sound.\n\nThe small numbers of black Appalachian Americans have been reported as increasingly accommodating to the Appalachian/Southern dialect commonly associated with white Appalachians. These similarities include an accent that is rhotic, the categorical use of the grammatical construction \"he works\" or \"she goes\" (rather than the AAVE \"he work\" and \"she go\"), and Appalachian vocabulary (such as \"airish\" for \"windy\"). However, even African-American English in Appalachia is diverse, with African-American women linguistically divided along sociocultural lines: culturally conservative and \"proper\" church-goers tending to use more Appalachian regional features, but \"porch sitters\" affiliated with nationwide black youth culture and music tending to use more AAVE features.\n\nAfrican-American English in the North Carolina Outer Banks is rapidly accommodating to urban AAVE through the recent generations, despite having aligned with local Outer Banks English for centuries.\n\nOlder or earlier African-American English refers to a set of many heterogeneous varieties studied and reconstructed by linguists as theoretically spoken by the first African Americans and African slaves in the United States. Of primary interest is the direct theoretical predecessor to AAVE. Mainly four types of sources have been used for the historical reconstruction of older AAVE: written interviews, ex-slave audio recordings, the modern diaspora dialects of isolated black communities, and letters written by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century African Americans. The use of the zero copula (the absence of \"is\" or \"are\", as in \"she gonna leave\"), nonstandard plural forms (\"the three man\", \"mans\", or even \"mens\") and multiple negatives (as in \"no one didn't leave me nothing\") were occasional or common variants in these earlier dialects, and the latter item even the preferred variant in certain grammatical contexts. Other nonstandard grammatical constructions associated with AAVE are documented in older dialects too; however, many of them are not, evidently being recent innovations of twentieth-century urban AAVE.\n\nSea Island Creole English, or \"Gullah\", is the distinct language of some African Americans along the South Carolina and Georgia coast. Gullah is an English creole: a natural language grammatically independent from English that uses mostly English vocabulary. Most Gullah speakers today probably form a continuum with the English language. A sub-dialect of Gullah is also spoken in Oklahoma and Texas, known as Afro-Seminole Creole.\n\nThere is a long tradition of representing the speech of blacks in American literature. A number of researchers have looked into the ways that American authors have depicted the speech of black characters, investigating how black identity is established and how it connects to other characters. argues that early mass media portrayals of black speech are the strongest historical evidence of a separate variety of English for blacks. Early popular works are also used to determine the similarities that historical varieties of black speech have in common with modern AAVE.\n\nThe earliest depictions of black speech came from works written in the eighteenth century, primarily by white authors. A notable exception is \"Clotel\", the first novel written by an African American (William Wells Brown). Depictions have largely been restricted to dialogue and the first novel written entirely in AAVE was June Jordan's \"His Own Where\" (1971), though Alice Walker's epistolary novel \"The Color Purple\" is a much more widely known work written entirely in AAVE. Lorraine Hansberry's 1959 play \"A Raisin in the Sun\" also has near exclusive use of AAVE. The poetry of Langston Hughes uses AAVE extensively.\n\nSome other notable works that have incorporated representations of black speech (with varying degrees of perceived authenticity) include:\n\nAs there is no established spelling system for AAVE, depicting it in literature is instead often done through spelling changes to indicate its phonological features, or to contribute to the impression that AAVE is being used (eye dialect). More recently, authors have begun focusing on grammatical cues, and even the use of certain rhetorical strategies.\n\nPortrayals of black characters in movies and television are also done with varying degrees of authenticity. In \"Imitation of Life\" (1934), the speech and behavioral patterns of Delilah (an African American character) are reminiscent of minstrel performances that set out to exaggerate stereotypes, rather than depict black speech authentically. More authentic performances, such as those in the following movies and TV shows, occur when certain speech events, vocabulary, and syntactic features are used to indicate AAVE usage, often with particular emphasis on young, urban African Americans:\n\nNonstandard African-American varieties of English have been stereotypically associated with a lower level of education and low social status. Since the 1960s, however, linguists have demonstrated that each of these varieties, and namely African-American Vernacular English, is a \"legitimate, rule-governed, and fully developed dialect\". The techniques used to improve the proficiency of African-American students learning standard written English have sometimes been similar to that of teaching a second language. Contrastive analysis is used for teaching topics in African-American Vernacular English. Both the phonological and syntactic features of a student's speech can be analyzed and recorded in order to identify points for contrast with Standard American English. Another way AAE can be taught is based on a strategy, communicative flexibility, that focuses on language used at home and analyzes speech during dramatic play. Using this method, children are taught to recognize when SAE is being used and in which occasions, rather than conforming to the speech around them in order to sound correct.\n\nAlthough the stigmatization of AAE has continued, AAE remains because it has functioned as a social identity marker for many African-Americans. The goal with teaching SAE is not to end its use, but to help students differentiate between settings where its use is and is not appropriate.\n\n\n\n"}

Her contribution to this \"landmark scholarship directed attention to the lives of Black women and, combined with the numerous articles she wrote thereafter, helped remedy the emphasis within Feminist Studies on white women and within Black studies on Black men\". \n\nThe interest in black feminism was on the rise in the 1970s, through the writings of Mary Helen Washington, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, and others.\n\nIn 1981, the anthology \"This Bridge Called My Back\", edited by Cherríe Moraga and Gloria E. Anzaldúa, was published and \"But Some of Us Are Brave\" was published the following year. In both anthologies, the emphasis was placed on the intersection between race and gender. The contributors argued that previous waves of feminism had focused on issues related to white women. They wanted to negotiate a large space for women of color. According to Teresa de Lauretis, \"This Bridge Called My Back\" and \"But Some Women Are Brave\" revealed \"the feelings, the analyses, and the political positions of feminists of color, and their critiques of white or mainstream feminism\" and created a \"shift in feminist consciousness.\"\n\nIn the 2000 reprint of their anthology, editors Hull, Bell-Scott, and Smith described how in 1992 black feminists mobilized \"a remarkable national response\" - \"African American Women in Defense of Ourselves\" - to the controversy surrounding the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of the United States against the backdrop of allegations by law professor Anita Hill, about sexual harassment that became part of Thomas' confirmation hearings.\n\nLegal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw cited \"But Some of Us Are Brave\", at the beginning of her seminal 1989 paper, \"Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics\" in which she introduced the concept of Intersectionality. Crenshaw is known for introducing and developing intersectional theory to feminism. Crenshaw noted that it was one of the \"very few Black women's studies books\". She used the title \"All the Women Are White; All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us are Brave\", as her \"point of departure\" to \"develop a Black feminist criticism\". \n\nBarbara Y. Welke published her article entitled \"When All the Women Were White, and All the Blacks Were Men: Gender, Class, Race, and the Road to Plessy, 1855–1914\", in reference to Hull et al, in 1995 in the \"Law and History Review.\" Welke wrote how Crenshaw, referring to Hull \"But Some of Us Are Brave\", said that the title \"sets forth a problematic consequence of the tendency to treat race and gender as mutually exclusive categories of experience and analysis.\"Crenshaw said that the title \"sets forth a problematic consequence of the tendency to treat race and gender as mutually exclusive categories of experience and analysis.\" \n\n\n"}

It is also associated with Hindu goddess Amba. \"Bhav\" means universe and \"Aai\" means mother, so it may be considered an art form dedicated to the Mother of the Universe, Amba. Bhavai is also known as \"Vesha\" or \"Swang\", which literally means 'get-up'.\n\nBhavai is believed to have originated in the 14th century. Asaita Thakar is traditionally credited for its origin.\n\nIn 14th century, Ganga, a daughter of Unjha headman Hema Patel, was kidnapped by Muslim subedar. Their family priest, Asaita Thakar who was a brahmin, went to subedar claiming Ganga as his daughter. To prove, subedar asked him to dine with Ganga as during those time, brahmins did not dine with lower castes. He dined with her to save her but upon return, he was outcaste by Brahmins. He started performing plays to earn his living which developed into specific dramatic form. Out of gratitude, Hema Patel also gave him a plot of land and financial support which mark the start of patronage of \"Bhavaiya\", the performers of Bhavai, by villages.\n\nIt is believed that Asaita Thakar wrote about 360 plays or \"Vesha\" (lit. dress) but only 60 have survived including some with his own names. In one of his plays, Asaita had dated his composition as AD 1360.\n\nBhavai performance appear clearly to have evolved from earlier forms of folk entertainment. It may have originated from medieval Sanskrit \"uparupaka (\"forms) which were performed in open. The word Bhavai in the sense of show or spectacle occurs in the 13th century Apabhramsa Jain religious verse. It says: \"In a tree-less tract even a bunch of eranda (caster oil plant) makes a good show (Bhavai).\" Abul Fazal’s Ain-e-Akbari also mentions Bhavai while mentioning some communities.\n\nThe Bhavai performers belong to a caste that came to be known as \"Taragala\".\n\nBhavai is partly entertainment and partly a ritual offering made to Goddess Amba. It is performed in open spaces in front of the temple. In the courtyard of the Ambaji temple near Mount Abu the Navratri festival is celebrated with Bhavai performances. Amba is the presiding deity of Bhavai.\n\nSubtle social criticism laced with pungent humour is the speciality of Bhavai. The pompous and incongrous behaviour of high caste people is scoffed at in Bhavai. Probably the anger over injustice suffered by the originator of Bhavai, Asaita Thakar, permeated the art of Bhavai. Some of the Bhavai plays present a scathing review of the caste-ridden social structure. People belonging to different levels of social strata ranging from king to knave are portrayed in Bhavai.\n\nBhavai Veshas portray people from all classes of society. The barbers and knife-sharpeners, robbers, bangle sellers and social and economic thieves, banjaras, odas, darjis, fakirs and sadhus. There is a Vesha depicting the story of an unsuccessful love affair of a Bania woman and a Muslim Thanedar. At the end of the play Jasma Odan, a Muslim fakir appears to whom people request to revive Jasma.\n\nHumor plays a vital part in any Bhavai performance and comes into play even while dealing with mythological personages. This predominance makes Bhavai unique among the traditional arts of India.\n\nThe chief of the Bhavai troupe is called the Nayak. He first marks the performing arena, then offers kumkum to the oil-torch or earthen lamp which is a symbol of goddess Amba and sings prayer songs in her praise. Then enters an actor covering his face with a plate, he is Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles. Goddess Kali is the next to enter and after she departs comes the Brahmana. The Vesha actually starts only after these preliminary appearances.\n\nThe Nayak and the jester always remain on stage and direct the course of action with their commentary and intervention. The story unfolds through songs, dialogues and speeches in prose as well as verse. There is lot of dancing and singing in Bhavai. Female characters are acted by men.\n\nThe language of Bhavai is a blend of Hindi, Urdu, and Marwari. Veshas were published for the first time in the nineteenth century and performances were linked to their predecessors through practice and the oral tradition.\n\nThe Bhungal is a four feet long copper pipe that provides a strong note and is unique to Bhavai. The bhungals are played during dance sequences and otherwise to indicate important characters. Other musical instruments that Bhavai performances include the pakhawaj (drums), jhanjha (cymbals), the sarangi (a stringed instrument), and the harmonium. The style of music is always Hindustani music interspersed with local tunes.\n\nBhavai is also prevalent in Rajasthan as a folk dance called Bhavai dance.\n\nMuljibhai Nayak, Pransukh Nayak, and Chimanlal Naik are some well known Bhavai performers of 20th century. With advent of cinema and television, the entertainment in village changed radically and the popularity of Bhavai declined and is decaying. The modern Gujarati theatre people tried to revive it with new plays but no coordinated effort is carried out.\n\n\"Jasma Odan\" based on Gujarati folk tale, written and directed by Shanta Gandhi; Rasiklal Parikh's \"Mena Gurjari\" (Mena of Gujarat, 1953) produced by Deena Gandhi and C. C. Mehta's \"Hololika\" (1956) were some of the most popular Bhavai musicals of modern times.\n\n\n"}

Cavender, who compiled the work under the anagrammatic pen name of H.C. Decanver.\n\nA reference work of religious criticism, the \"Catalogue\" is Decanver's debut publication, and his only written work. It is notable as one of the most prominent writings critical of Methodist doctrine ever written, and remains the only compilation of books written from a primarily anti-Methodist perspective.\n\nAn otherwise virtually unknown individual, the only evidence which suggests that the author Decanver ever existed was the publication of his \"Catalogue\" in 1846. He was self-evidently opposed to the doctrines of Methodism, a branch of Protestant Christianity which emerged from the teachings of John Wesley in 18th century England, and in 1846 compiled the catalogue under the full title of Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: from its Origin in 1729, to the Present Time: of Those by Methodist Authors on Lay-Representation, Methodist Episcopacy, Etc., Etc., and of the Political Pamphlets Relating to Wesley's \"Calm Address to Our American Colonies\". The pseudonym \"H.C. Decanver\" is an anagram of the author's actual name, Curtis H. Cavender.\n\nThe book was first published in both hardback and paperback by the presently-defunct John Penington publishing company, once located on 10 South Fifth Street in eastern Philadelphia. The original printings were attributed to an individual \"C.

{"id": "2393698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2393698", "title": "Collaborative fiction", "text": "Collaborative fiction\n\nCollaborative fiction is a form of writing by a group of three or more authors who share creative control of a story.\n\nCollaborative fiction can occur for commercial gain, as part of education, or recreationally – many collaboratively written works have been the subject of a large degree of academic research.\n\nA collaborative author may focus on a specific protagonist or character in the narrative thread, and then pass the story to another writer for further additions or a change in focus to a different protagonist. Alternatively, authors might write the text for their own particular subplot within an overall narrative, in which case one author may have the responsibility of integrating the story as a whole. In Italy, various groups of authors have developed more advanced methods of interaction and production\n\nThe methods used by commercial collaborative writers vary tremendously. When beginning writing the short story 'the toy mill' Karl Schroeder and David Nickle began by writing alternating sentences, whereas when English authors Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman wrote \"Good Omens\" they largely wrote separate plotlines and then collaborated much more heavily when revising the manuscript.\n\nThe collaboration may be very limited indeed, when John Green and David Levithan wrote \"Will Grayson, Will Grayson\" the only plot point they decided on was that two characters would meet at some point in the novel and that their meeting would have a tremendous effect on their lives. After this decision, they separately wrote the first three chapters for their half and then shared them with each other. After sharing, they then \"knew immediately it was going to work\", as stated by Levithan.\n\nFrom an academic perspective, there is anxiety about collaborative authorial endeavors. Academics are concerned with being able to discover who wrote what, and which ideas belong to whom. Specifically, in the humanities collaborative authorship has been frowned upon in favor of the individual author. In these instances, antiquated ideas of individual genius influence how scholars look at issues of attribution and tenure. Collaboration scholars Ede and Lunsford note, \"everyday practices in the humanities continue to ignore, or even to punish, collaboration while authorizing work attributed to (autonomous) individuals\". In particular, literary-critical essays often move to \"settle\" questions of authorship before moving on to their central interpretive purposes. \nWoodmansee uses studies of writing practices since the Renaissance to conclude that the modern definition of authorship, is a 'relatively recent formation' and that previously 'more corporate and collaborative' forms of writing prevailed, suggesting a long history of Collaborative Fiction. She further argues that the concept that 'genuine authorship consists in individual acts of origination' is an entirely modern myth.\n\nFor Renaissance playwrights, collaboration appears to have been the norm, Bently notes that nearly two-thirds of plays mentioned in Henslowe's papers reflect the participation of more than one writer. There is also an issue of continuous revision, it was common practice in Renaissance English theatre for professional writers attached to a company to compose new characters, scenes, prologues and epilogues for plays in which they did not originally have a hand. Scott McMillin has exported revision as a deconstruction of authorial individuality in the Sir Thomas More manuscript.\n\nIn an artistic sense, as Lorraine York notes, \"Critics and readers feel a persistent need to 'de-collaborate' these works, to parse the collective text into the separate contributions of two or more authors\". This is part of a tradition in criticism to view collaboration as a subset or aberrant kind of individual authorship – such that later readers could separate out by examining the collaborative text. Particular examples of this approach to criticism include Cyrus Hoy who studies authorship in the Beaumont/Fletcher plays.\n\nThere have been several university-based projects that investigated collaborative fiction, both from a writing perspective and as a testbed for scientific techniques, such as visualization of narrative structure.\n\n\"Caverns\" is a 1989 novel written collaboratively as an experiment by Ken Kesey and a creative writing class that he taught at the University of Oregon. The cover of the book says it was written by O.U. Levon—the name of this supposed author, spelled backwards, is \"novel U.O.\" (University of Oregon).\n\nBecause of Kesey's attachment to the project, the book was widely reviewed in newspapers and magazines. Critics were generally intrigued by the book but ultimately critical of its shortcomings: noting in particular the lack of a coherent voice and a too-large cast of characters. Writing in \"The Los Angeles Times\", Bob Sipchen noted, \"\"Caverns\" is an amusing lark, full of weird characters and goofy plot twists. It was a sufficiently intriguing project to make The Mainstream Media swarm around Kesey again. But no one is calling \"Caverns\" literature.\"\n\nThe first well-known wikinovel was \"A Million Penguins\", an experimental work launched in 2007 by Penguin Books in collaboration with Kate Pullinger on behalf of the Institute of Creative Technologies at De Montfort University, apparently inspired by the success of Wikipedia. Its website was heavily advertised and it quickly became a target for vandalism. On March 7, 2007, the Penguin Books UK blog announced that the project had come to an end.\n\nThe story could be contributed to by any site visitor, although a team of students at the University moderated contributions, in an attempt to keep the project on-track. Due to the site receiving more than 100 edits every hour, Penguin imposed \"reading windows\" that froze the novel so that editors could read over what had been changed to get their bearings on where the story was going.\n\nReactions to the project were mixed, with some commentators expressing interest in seeing how the project took shape, including the potential educational benefits while some described its progress as \"predictably horrible\".\n\nIn April 2008, the Institute of Creative Technologies of De Montfort University published \"A Million Penguins Research Report\", which concluded:\n\nThe Australian rural genre novel \"The Painted Sky\" (2015, Penguin Random House) / \"Der Bunte Himmel\" (2015, Ullstein Buchverlage) was written by five Australian women under the pen name, Alice Campion. Four of the group went on to collaboratively write \"The Shifting Light\" (2017, Penguin Random House). Their unique writing process has resulted in critics applauding their ‘single’ author voice\n\nItaly has a strong tradition in collaborative fiction: the most remarkable texts being \"\", a 1929 collective novel by the futurist team \"Gruppo dei Dieci\", Don Milani's Scuola di Barbiana experiment, \"Lettera a una professoressa\" (1967), the various historical best-sellers produced by the Wu Ming collective between 1999 and 2011, and \"In territorio nemico\", the 115-author novel realized within the SIC – project founded by Gregorio Magini and , which established a codified methodology for the collective production of literary texts.\n\nAustralia has a number of famous writing teams. In 1944 James McAuley and Harold Stewart collaborating as Ern Malley wrote seventeen poems in one day as a hoax against Max Harris and his magazine \"Angry Penguins\". From the late 1920s to the late 1940s Flora Eldershaw and Marjorie Barnard wrote under the name of M. Barnard Eldershaw. During that time they published an impressive body of work that included 5 novels. Evidently Barnard did more of the actual writing whilst Eldershaw concentrated on development and structure of the works. Louise E Rorabacher who wrote about the collaboration stated: \"that in their early collaborative novels it is impossible to distinguish their separate contributions.\" The partnership worked because according to Nettie Palmer, a leading literary critic of the time: \"Any difference in the characters of the two women doesn't make for a difference in their point of view or values.\" Dymphna Cusack wrote twelve novels, two of which were collaborations. She wrote \"Come in Spinner\", a novel set in Sydney during the end of World War II, with Florence James. The completed book was submitted and won the 1948 \"Daily Telegraph\" novel competition. Cusack also collaborated with another writer – Miles Franklin on the 1939 novel \"Pioneers on Parade\". The 2015 Australian outback novel The Painted Sky was written by a group of five, and its 2017 sequel The Shifting Light by four authors who collaboratively write under the pseudonym Alice Campion. Both novels were published by Penguin Random House in Australia. As 'Group Fiction', three of the collective have also written a guide to collaborative fiction writing called How to Write Fiction as a Group.\n\nCollaborative writing has been used to increase community engagement in writing: one of the three 2008 TED Prizes was given to Dave Eggers, partially for his work with the 826 project, which uses many collaborative techniques to engage school children, and community groups in writing. The 826 Valencia chapter consists of a writing lab, a street-front pirate supply store that partially funds the programs, and two satellite classrooms in nearby middle schools. Over 1,400 volunteers—including published authors, magazine founders, SAT-course instructors, and documentary filmmakers—have donated time to work with thousands of students since the chapter was founded. His TED Prize wish was for community members to personally engage with local public schools.\n\nOther educationally motivated work has been developed by the University of London and used both to improve the writing skills of the participants and as a testing ground for scientific techniques, such as visualization of narrative structure. The project attempted to show students the workflow of a novel from inception to production and to improve teamwork and feedback skills. Workshops lasted up to a week and aimed to produce a full-length novel from a plot idea provided by an established author, with younger students producing smaller sized novels. Because the workshops were very short the use of collaborative writing was required so that a novel could be produced in the timeframe. Techniques from software engineering were used to arrange the workload amongst the students.\n\nCollaborative fiction can be fully open with no rules or enforced structure as it moves from author to author; however, many collaborative fiction works adopt some set of rule on what constitutes an acceptable contribution.\n\nWriting games for collaborative writing have a tradition in literary groups such as the Dadaists and the Oulipo. The advent of the internet has seen many such collaborative writing games go online, resulting both in hypertext fiction and in more conventional literary production. For example, the Baen's bar forum, known as 1632 Tech, has been a prime force behind the many works in the popular alternate history 1632 series under the aegis of Eric Flint — especially The Grantville Gazettes. Author and scholar Scott Rettber's paper \"Collective Narrative\" discusses connections between avant garde literary groups and online collaborative fiction.\n\nOther forms of collaborative fiction have evolved from the practices of tabletop and role-playing video game gamers and related 'fandom' activities. Role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons are often seen as a process to generate narratives though each characters interactions\nSuch table top role-playing has always been an exercise in collaborative fiction, but can possess more structured rules: players acting out in an antisocial way can be penalised by the game mechanics (though they are just as likely to be penalised socially).\n\nEventually, these tabletop behaviors merged with hypertext fiction to create text-based interactive role-playing environments, like roleplaying MUSHes. In 2001, OtherSpace became the first such game to publish a novel taken from these interactions.\n\nRing of Fire (series), a series of alternate history books by Eric Flint and other authors set in a universe created by Eric Flint with the intention of integrating multiple authors into the fabric of the universe structure.\n\nSites such as Orion's Arm, Galaxiki, and encourage the development of fictional universes rather than novels (though 'Epic Legends' is parody of fantasy universes).\n\nWith the development of the internet collaborative writing is gaining new relevance with various online collaborative writing platforms emerging. Most popular are collaborative real-time editors such as Etherpad and Google Docs which are however mostly used for coordinating projects and brainstorming. Nevertheless, they have also been used to collectively write works of fiction, such as \"The Legacy of Totalitarianism in a Tundra\" – an over 300 page book written by anonymous users of the Literature (\"/lit/\") board of 4chan from over 71 countries using GoogleDocs.\n\nTraditional fiction writers and writing circles have experimented in creating group stories, such as Robert Asprin's Thieves World and MythAdventures – such approaches date back at least as far as \"The Floating Admiral\" in 1931. There are many highly regarded collaborations, but also some collaborative work produced as spoofs or hoaxes such as \"Naked Came the Stranger\", which was allegedly written to illustrate the point that popular American literary culture had become mindlessly vulgar.\nThe Australian genre fiction collaborators known as Alice Campion are thought to be the first in the world to publish commercial fiction as a team of five, now four. Their popular novels, \"The Painted Sky\" (2015) and \"The Shifting Light\" (2017) were published by Penguin Random House.\n\nThe disadvantages of the collaborative writing process can include problems with series or sequels to successful books, if one partner has other commitments or is bored with the project, then losses, delays and pressure on the relationship may occur. The Association of Authors' Representatives recommends that \"a collaboration agreement must deal with termination of the collaboration: How the collaborators can part ways, who keeps the money, who keeps the rights to the material\".\n\nMoreover, there can be legal complications if, for example, two authors are under contract to write other books individually for different publishers – if there is any overlap on the types of books then the contractual responsibilities need to be thoroughly examined to avoid copyright problems.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "295993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295993", "title": "Critical legal studies", "text": "Critical legal studies\n\nCritical legal studies (CLS) is a school of critical theory that first emerged as a movement in the United States during the 1970s. Critical Legal Studies adherents claim that laws are used to maintain the status quo of society's power structures; it is also held that the law is a codified form of society's biases against marginalized groups. Despite wide variation in the opinions of critical legal scholars around the world there is general consensus regarding the key goals of Critical Legal Studies:\n\n\nConsidered \"the first movement in legal theory and legal scholarship in the United States to have espoused a committed Left political stance and perspective\", critical legal studies was committed to shaping society based on a vision of human personality devoid of the hidden interests and class domination that CLS scholars argued are at the root of liberal legal institutions in the West. According to CLS scholars Duncan Kennedy and Karl Klare, critical legal studies was \"concerned with the relationship of legal scholarship and practice to the struggle to create a more humane, egalitarian, and democratic society.\" During its period of peak influence, the critical legal studies movement caused considerable controversy within the legal academy. Members such as Roberto Mangabeira Unger have sought to rebuild these institutions as an expression of human coexistence and not just a provisional truce in a brutal struggle and were seen as the most powerful voices and the only way forward for the movement. Unger and other members of the movement continue to try to develop it in new directions, e.g., to make legal analysis the basis of developing institutional alternatives.\n\nThe abbreviations \"CLS\" and \"Crit\" are sometimes used to refer to the movement and its adherents.\n\nAlthough the intellectual origins of the critical legal studies (CLS) can be generally traced to American legal realism, as a distinct scholarly movement CLS fully emerged only in the late 1970s. Many first-wave American CLS scholars entered legal education, having been profoundly influenced by the experiences of the civil rights movement, women's rights movement, and the anti-war movement of the 1960s and 1970s. What started off as a critical stance towards American domestic politics eventually translated into a critical stance towards the dominant legal ideology of modern Western society. Drawing on both domestic theory and the work of European social theorists, the \"crits\" sought to demystify what they saw as the numerous myths at the heart of mainstream legal thought and practice.\n\nThe British critical legal studies movement started roughly at a similar time as its American counterpart. However, it centered around a number of conferences held annually, particularly the Critical Legal Conference and the National Critical Lawyers Group. There remain a number of fault lines in the community; between theory and practice, between those who look to Marxism and those who worked on Deconstruction, between those who look to explicitly political engagements and those who work in aesthetics and ethics.\n\nCritical legal studies had its intellectual origins in the American legal realist movement in the 1930s. Prior to the 1930s, American jurisprudence had been dominated by a formalist account of how courts decide cases, an account which held that judges decide cases on the basis of distinctly legal rules and reasons that justify a unique result. The legal realists argued that statutory and case law is indeterminate, and that appellate courts decide cases not based upon law, but upon what they deem fair in light of the facts of a case. Considered \"the most important jurisprudential movement of the 20th century\", American legal realism sent a shock through American legal scholarship by undermining the formalist tenets that were long considered a bedrock of jurisprudence.\n\nThe influence of legal realism unsettled American jurisprudence for decades. Alan Hunt writes that the period \"between the realism of the 1930s and the emergence of critical legal studies in the late 1970s has been a series of unsuccessful attempts to recover from the shock of realism some basis for a legal theory which articulates an image of the objectivity of the legal process, even though the explanation offered by post-realism had to be more complex than that provided by a doctrine of rule-following.\"\n\nThe critical legal studies movement emerged in the mid-1970s as a network of leftist law professors in the United States who developed the realist indeterminacy thesis in the service of leftist ideals. According to Roberto Unger, the movement \"continued as an organizing force only until the late 1980s. Its life as a movement lasted for barely more than a decade.\"\n\nDuncan Kennedy, a Harvard law professor who along with Unger was one of the key figures in the movement, has said that, in the early days of critical legal studies, \"just about everyone in the network was a white male with some interest in 60s style radical politics or radical sentiment of one kind or another. Some came from Marxist backgrounds--some came from democratic reform.\" Kennedy has emphasized the twofold nature of critical legal studies, as both a network of leftist scholar/activists and a scholarly literature:\n\n[C]ritical legal studies has two aspects. It’s a scholarly literature and it has also been a network of people who were thinking of themselves as activists in law school politics. Initially, the scholarly literature was produced by the same people who were doing law school activism. Critical legal studies is not a theory. It’s basically this literature produced by this network of people. I think you can identify some themes of the literature, themes that have changed over time.\n\nScholars affiliated with critical legal studies often identified with the movement in several ways: by including in their articles an opening footnote mentioning the Conference on Critical Legal Studies and providing the organization’s contact information, by attending conferences of the CCLS, and by citing the work of fellow critical legal studies scholars. A 1984 bibliography of CLS works, compiled by Duncan Kennedy and Karl Klare and published in the Yale Law Journal, included dozens of authors and hundreds of works.\n\nA 2011 collection of four volumes edited by Costas Douzinas and Colin Perrin, with the assistance of J-M Barreto, compiles the work of the British Critical Legal Studies, including their philosophical mentors. It showcases scholarship elaborated since its origins in the late 1980s in areas such as legal philosophy, literature, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, feminism, gender, sexuality, post-colonialism, race, ethics, politics and human rights.\n\nProminent participants in the CLS movement include Drucilla Cornell, Mark Kelman, Alan Hunt, Catharine MacKinnon, Duncan Kennedy, David Kennedy, Martti Koskenniemi, Gary Peller, Peter Fitzpatrick, Morton Horwitz, Jack Balkin, Costas Douzinas, Karl Klare, Peter Gabel, Roberto Unger, Renata Salecl, Mark Tushnet, Louis Michael Seidman, John Strawson and Martha Fineman.\n\nToday, a new perspective is born in Brazil, in the context of Latin America, so called the Theory of Realistic Humanism as a Critical Theory in the Theory of Law.\n\nRoberto Unger, a key member of critical legal studies whose influence had continued to be far-reaching in the decades following the movement’s decline, has written that the founders of critical legal studies \"never meant it to become an ongoing school of thought or genre of writing. They wanted to intervene in a particular circumstance ...\"\n\nThat circumstance was the dominant practice of legal analysis which Unger calls the \"method of reasoned elaboration\". A close descendant of nineteenth-century doctrinal formalism, which sought through legal analysis to identify the \"inbuilt legal content of a ... free society\", the method of reasoned elaboration treated law materials as containing an \"ideal element\", an inherent legal substance underlying the contradictions and ambiguities in the law's text. Under the practice of reasoned elaboration, this inherent legal substance forms a prescriptive system that judges gradually uncover by reasoning through the policies and principles of law without questioning the \"basic institutional arrangements of the market economy, of democratic politics, and of civil society outside the market and the state\".\n\nReasoned elaboration was a pernicious influence for several reasons, Unger and others argued: it de-emphasized the contingent nature of law as a product of deals and compromise, instead treating it as containing a coherent prescriptive system that needed simply to be uncovered by legal interpretation; it obscured how judges usurp authority by denying their own role in making law; and finally, reasoned elaboration inhibited the use of law as a mechanism of social change.\n\nIn addition to the context of legal interpretation, critical legal studies also emerged in response to its political context, namely a setting in which the social-democratic settlement that was finalized after World War II had become canonical, and active dispute over the organization of society severely declined, effectively enshrining a reigning consensus about social organization that Unger describes as including a \"combination of neoliberal orthodoxy, state capitalism, and compensatory redistribution by tax and transfer.\" Critical legal scholars challenged that consensus and sought to use legal theory as a means to explore alternative forms of social and political organization.\n\nIn accordance with the Critical rationalism the German jurist Reinhold Zippelius uses Popper's method of \"trial and error\" in his 'Legal Philosophy'.\n\nAlthough the CLS (like most schools and movements) has not produced a single, monolithic body of thought, several common themes can be generally traced in its adherents' works. These include:\n\nIncreasingly, however, the traditional themes are being superseded by broader and more radical critical insights. Interventions in intellectual property law, human rights, jurisprudence, criminal law, property law, international law, etc., have proved crucial to the development of those discourses. Equally, CLS has introduced new frameworks to the legal field, such as postmodernism, queer theory, literary approaches to law, psychoanalysis, law and aesthetics, and post-colonialism.\n\nCLS continues as a diverse collection of schools of thought and social movements. The CLS community is an extremely broad group with clusters of critical theorists at law schools and socio-legal studies departments such as Harvard Law School, Georgetown University Law Center, Northeastern University, University at Buffalo, Chicago-Kent College of Law, Birkbeck, University of London, University of Melbourne, University of Kent, Carleton University, Keele University, the University of Glasgow, the University of East London among others.\n\nIn the American legal academy its influence and prominence seems to have waned in recent years. However, offshoots of CLS, including critical race theory continue to grow in popularity. Associated schools of thought, such as contemporary feminist theory and ecofeminism and critical race theory now play a major role in contemporary legal scholarship. An impressive stream of CLS-style writings has also emerged in the last two decades in the areas of international and comparative law.\n\nIn addition, CLS has had a practical effect on legal education, as it was the inspiration and focus of Georgetown University Law Center's alternative first year curriculum, (Termed \"Curriculum B\", known as \"Section 3\" within the school). In the UK both Kent and Birkbeck have sought to draw critical legal insights into the legal curriculum, including a critical legal theory based LLM at Birkbeck's School of Law. Various research centers and institutions offer CLS-based taught and research courses in a variety of legal fields including human rights, jurisprudence, constitutional theory and criminal justice.\n\nIn New Zealand, the University of Otago Legal Issues Centre was established at the University's law faculty in 2007.\n\n\"Law and Critique\" is one of the few UK journals that specifically identifies itself with critical legal theory. In America, \"The Crit\" is the only journal that continues to explicitly position itself as a platform for critical legal studies. However, other journals such as \"Law, Culture and the Humanities\", \"Unbound: The Harvard Journal of the Legal Left\", the \"Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review\", \"The National Lawyers Guild Review\", \"Social and Legal Studies\", and \"The Australian Feminist Law Journal\" all published avowedly critical legal research.\n\nFurther information on the title subject, presented in inverse order of date of publication, and alphabetical by author, within year:\n\n"}

His most influential work has been in the fields of cognitive anthropology and linguistic pragmatics: developing, with British psychologist Deirdre Wilson, relevance theory in the latter; and an approach to cultural evolution known as the 'epidemiology of representations' in the former. Sperber currently holds the positions of \"Directeur de Recherche émérite\" at the \"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique\" and Director of the International Cognition and Culture Institute.\n\nSperber is the son of Austrian-French novelist Manès Sperber. He was born in France and raised an atheist but his parents, both non-religious Ashkenazi Jews, imparted to the young Sperber a \"respect for my Rabbinic ancestors and for religious thinkers of any persuasion more generally\". He became interested in anthropology as a means of explaining how rational people come to hold mistaken religious beliefs about the supernatural.\n\nSperber was trained in anthropology at the Sorbonne and the University of Oxford. In 1965 he joined the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) as a researcher, initially in the \"Laboratoire d'Études Africaines\" (). Later he moved to the \"Laboratoire d'ethnologie et de sociologie comparative\" (Ethnology and Comparative Sociology), the \"Centre de Recherche en Epistémelogie Appliquée\" and finally, from 2001, the \"Institut Jean Nicod\". Sperber's early work was on the anthropology of religion, and he conducted ethnographic fieldwork among the Dorze people of Ethiopia.\n\nSperber was an early proponent of structural anthropology, having been introduced to it by Rodney Needham at Oxford, and helped popularise it in British social anthropology. At the CNRS he studied under Claude Lévi-Strauss, credited as the founder of structuralism, who encouraged Sperber's \"untypical theoretical musings\". In the 1970s, however, Sperber came to be identified with post-structuralism in French anthropology, and criticised the theories of Lévi-Strauss and other structuralists for using interpretive ethnographic data as if it were an objective record, and for its lack of explanatory power. Nevertheless, Sperber has persistently defended the legacy of Lévi-Strauss' work as opening the door for naturalistic social science, and as an important precursor to cognitive anthropology.\n\nAfter moving away from structuralism, Sperber sought an alternative naturalistic approach to the study of culture. His 1975 book \"Rethinking Symbolism\", outlined a theory of symbolism using concepts from the burgeoning field of cognitive psychology. It was formulated as a reply to semiological theories which were becoming widespread in anthropology through the works of Victor Turner and Clifford Geertz (which formed the basis of what come to be known as symbolic anthropology). Sperber's later work has continued to argue for the importance of cognitive processes understood through psychology in understanding cultural phenomena and, in particular, cultural transmission. His 'epidemiology of representations' is an approach to cultural evolution inspired by the field of epidemiology. It proposes that the distribution of cultural representations (ideas about the world held by multiple individuals) within a population should be explained with reference to biases in transmission (illuminated by cognitive and evolutionary psychology) and the \"ecology\" of the individual minds they inhabit. Sperber's approach is broadly Darwinist—it explains the macro-distribution of a trait in a population in terms of the cumulative effect micro-processes acting over time—but departs from memetics because he does not see representations as replicators except for in a few special circumstances (such as chain letters). The cognitive and epidemiological approach to cultural evolution has been influential, but as a means of explaining culture more generally it is pursued by only a small minority of scholars. His latest work, published with cognitive scientist Hugo Mercier, has developed their argumentative theory of reason.\nHis most influential work is arguably in linguistics and philosophy: with the British linguist and philosopher Deirdre Wilson he has developed an innovative approach to linguistic interpretation known as relevance theory which has become mainstream in the area of pragmatics, linguistics, artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology. He argues that cognitive processes are geared toward the maximisation of relevance, that is, a search for an optimal balance between cognitive efforts and cognitive effects.\n\nAs well as his emeritus position at the CNRS, Sperber is currently the Director of the International Cognition and Culture Institute, a cross-disciplinary research institution based at the London School of Economics and \"Institut Jean Nicod\". He is a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy and in 2009 was awarded the inaugural Claude Lévi-Strauss Prize for excellence of French research in the humanities and social sciences. In 2011 he gave a Turku Agora Lecture.\n\n\n\n"}

However, most states will not apply this doctrine to protect a person who was \"aware\" that the incorporation effort was defective at the time that they purported to act on behalf of the corporation.\n\nCorporation by estoppel, on the other hand, applies against someone who operates a business \"as if it were\" a limited liability entity or corporation, irrespective of whether there was a good faith effort by the business to incorporate. The person doing business with such an entity, as if it were a limited liability entity or corporation, may later be estopped from arguing that it is not in fact a limited liability entity, in an attempt to reach the assets of the incorporators. For the same reason, defendants who had acted as a corporation will be estopped from denying liability as a corporation when sued by a plaintiff who had relied on the defendant's corporate form when dealing with the defendant.\n\nBoth doctrines are applicable in the contract context but the estoppel concept typically does not apply where tort liability is sought because knowledge of corporate existence is irrelevant to the commission of tort. The harm caused by a tortious act normally does not depend on knowledge, or lack thereof, of a corporation's existence.\n"}

There it remained until 1998, when, with the opening of the Museo di Santa Giulia, the diptych reached its current location in the \"Collectibles and Applied Art\" department, in the vitrines dedicated to Querini's collection.\n\nThe image on the surviving panel is divided into two parts.\n\nOn the upper register there is an important individual, most likely the senator Lampadius, who holds a sceptre topped by an image of the Emperor in one hand and the white cloth (or \"mappa\") for giving the signal to begin the games in his other hand. Either side of him, depicted at a smaller scale are two other functionaries, perhaps his sons. The three individuals are inside a box decorated with panels with geometric patterns. Behind them a cornice supports a curvilinear architrave, above which the fragmentary inscription is found.\n\nIn the lower register of the panel is a stylisted version of the race course in the circus, which four quadrigae, each drawn by four horses which run around the \"spina\" (the median strip) which has an obelisk in the centre, covered with stylised simplifications of Egyptian hieroglyphs. This might recall the Circus Maximus and its obelisks. At the two ends of the \"spina\" are things which seem to represent groups of statuary. \n\nThe depiction of the race track is very interesting both for its subject matter and for its technical execution, which stylises the course and all its features within the restricted space of the panel in a very efficient way, using side, front, and back views of the space alternately.\n\n"}

The journal also publishes regular ‘symposium’ sections and review articles devoted to briefer analysis of particular events, political issues and important theoretical and conceptual developments. All research articles in \"East European Politics\" have undergone rigorous peer review, based on initial editor screening and anonymized refereeing by at least two anonymous referees.\n\nThe \"Journal of Communist Studies\" was founded in 1984 by a group of scholars (Michael Waller, Richard Gillespie, Ron Hill, David Goodman, David Bell, and Michael Williams) with a shared intellectual interest in communist political systems, successors to an editorial team that had produced \"Documents in communist affairs\" (published in the early 1980s by Butterworths) and other publications dealing with the communist movement. While the journal set out to reflect the growing complexity of the communist world and movements, in the 1980s, its focus was on the ‘core’ countries and parties that had historically been part of the world of the Communist International. The primary emphasis was on politics, but history, sociology, non-technical economics, biography, and comparative studies also featured.\n\nIn 1992, \"and Transition Politics\" was added to the title to reflect changing realities. Following the change of title, the scope both widened, to embrace regime change and democratisation, and in practice also narrowed, to concentrate somewhat more on political analysis.

{"id": "11954274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11954274", "title": "Enron scandal", "text": "Enron scandal\n\nThe Enron scandal, publicized in October 2001, eventually led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation, an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, and the \"de facto\" dissolution of Arthur Andersen, which was one of the five largest audit and accountancy partnerships in the world. In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history at that time, Enron was cited as the biggest audit failure.\n\nEnron was formed in 1985 by Kenneth Lay after merging Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Several years later, when Jeffrey Skilling was hired, he developed a staff of executives that – by the use of accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting – were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's Board of Directors and Audit Committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Arthur Andersen to ignore the issues.\n\nEnron shareholders filed a $40 billion lawsuit after the company's stock price, which achieved a high of US$90.75 per share in mid-2000, plummeted to less than $1 by the end of November 2001. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation, and rival Houston competitor Dynegy offered to purchase the company at a very low price. The deal failed, and on December 2, 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Enron's $63.4 billion in assets made it the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history until WorldCom's bankruptcy the next year.\n\nMany executives at Enron were indicted for a variety of charges and some were later sentenced to prison. Andersen was found guilty of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation, which voided its license to audit public companies and effectively closed the firm. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices.\n\nAs a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.\n\nIn 1985, Kenneth Lay merged the natural gas pipeline companies of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth to form Enron. In the early 1990s, he helped to initiate the selling of electricity at market prices, and soon after, Congress approved legislation deregulating the sale of natural gas. The resulting markets made it possible for traders such as Enron to sell energy at higher prices, thereby significantly increasing its revenue. After producers and local governments decried the resultant price volatility and asked for increased regulation, strong lobbying on the part of Enron and others prevented such regulation.\n\nAs Enron became the largest seller of natural gas in North America by 1992, its trading of gas contracts earned $122 million (before interest and taxes), the second largest contributor to the company's net income. The November 1999 creation of the EnronOnline trading website allowed the company to better manage its contracts trading business.\n\nIn an attempt to achieve further growth, Enron pursued a diversification strategy. The company owned and operated a variety of assets including gas pipelines, electricity plants, pulp and paper plants, water plants, and broadband services across the globe. The corporation also gained additional revenue by trading contracts for the same array of products and services with which it was involved.\nThis included setting up power generation plants in developing countries and emerging markets including The Philippines (Subic Bay), Indonesia and India (Dabhol).\n\nEnron's stock increased from the start of the 1990s until year-end 1998 by 311%, only modestly higher than the average rate of growth in the Standard & Poor 500 index. However, the stock increased by 56% in 1999 and a further 87% in 2000, compared to a 20% increase and a 10% decrease for the index during the same years. By December 31, 2000, Enron's stock was priced at $83.13 and its market capitalization exceeded $60 billion, 70 times earnings and six times book value, an indication of the stock market's high expectations about its future prospects. In addition, Enron was rated the most innovative large company in America in \"Fortune\"'s Most Admired Companies survey.\n\nEnron's complex financial statements were confusing to shareholders and analysts. In addition, its complex business model and unethical practices required that the company use accounting limitations to misrepresent earnings and modify the balance sheet to indicate favorable performance.\n\nThe combination of these issues later resulted in the bankruptcy of the company, and the majority of them were perpetuated by the indirect knowledge or direct actions of Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, Andrew Fastow, and other executives such as Rebecca Mark. Lay served as the chairman of the company in its last few years, and approved of the actions of Skilling and Fastow, although he did not always inquire about the details. Skilling constantly focused on meeting Wall Street expectations, advocated the use of mark-to-market accounting (accounting based on market value, which was then inflated) and pressured Enron executives to find new ways to hide its debt. Fastow and other executives \"created off-balance-sheet vehicles, complex financing structures, and deals so bewildering that few people could understand them.\"\n\nEnron and other energy suppliers earned profits by providing services such as wholesale trading and risk management in addition to building and maintaining electric power plants, natural gas pipelines, storage, and processing facilities. When accepting the risk of buying and selling products, merchants are allowed to report the selling price as revenues and the products' costs as cost of goods sold. In contrast, an \"agent\" provides a service to the customer, but does not take the same risks as merchants for buying and selling. Service providers, when classified as agents, are able to report trading and brokerage fees as revenue, although not for the full value of the transaction.\n\nAlthough trading companies such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch used the conventional \"agent model\" for reporting revenue (where only the trading or brokerage fee would be reported as revenue), Enron instead selected to report the entire value of each of its trades as revenue. This \"merchant model\" was considered much more aggressive in the accounting interpretation than the agent model. Enron's method of reporting inflated trading revenue was later adopted by other companies in the energy trading industry in an attempt to stay competitive with the company's large increase in revenue. Other energy companies such as Duke Energy, Reliant Energy, and Dynegy joined Enron in the wealthiest 50 of the \"Fortune\" 500 mainly due to their adoption of the same trading revenue accounting as Enron.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2000, Enron's revenues increased by more than 750%, rising from $13.3 billion in 1996 to $100.8 billion in 2000. This extensive expansion of 65% per year was unprecedented in any industry, including the energy industry which typically considered growth of 2–3% per year to be respectable. For just the first nine months of 2001, Enron reported $138.7 billion in revenues, which placed the company at the sixth position on the \"Fortune\" Global 500.\n\nIn Enron's natural gas business, the accounting had been fairly straightforward: in each time period, the company listed actual costs of supplying the gas and actual revenues received from selling it. However, when Skilling joined the company, he demanded that the trading business adopt mark-to-market accounting, citing that it would represent \"true economic value.\" Enron became the first non-financial company to use the method to account for its complex long-term contracts. Mark-to-market accounting requires that once a long-term contract was signed, income is estimated as the present value of net future cash flow. Often, the viability of these contracts and their related costs were difficult to estimate. Due to the large discrepancies of attempting to match profits and cash, investors were typically given false or misleading reports. While using the method, income from projects could be recorded, although they might not have ever received the money, and in turn increasing financial earnings on the books. However, in future years, the profits could not be included, so new and additional income had to be included from more projects to develop additional growth to appease investors. As one Enron competitor stated, \"If you accelerate your income, then you have to keep doing more and more deals to show the same or rising income.\" Despite potential pitfalls, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the accounting method for Enron in its trading of natural gas futures contracts on January 30, 1992. However, Enron later expanded its use to other areas in the company to help it meet Wall Street projections.\n\nFor one contract, in July 2000, Enron and Blockbuster Video signed a 20-year agreement to introduce on-demand entertainment to various U.S. cities by year-end. After several pilot projects, Enron recognized estimated profits of more than $110 million from the deal, even though analysts questioned the technical viability and market demand of the service. When the network failed to work, Blockbuster withdrew from the contract. Enron continued to recognize future profits, even though the deal resulted in a loss.\n\nEnron used special purpose entities—limited partnerships or companies created to fulfill a temporary or specific purpose to fund or manage risks associated with specific assets. The company elected to disclose minimal details on its use of \"special purpose entities\". These shell companies were created by a sponsor, but funded by independent equity investors and debt financing. For financial reporting purposes, a series of rules dictate whether a special purpose entity is a separate entity from the sponsor. In total, by 2001, Enron had used hundreds of special purpose entities to hide its debt. Enron used a number of special purpose entities, such as partnerships in its Thomas and Condor tax shelters, financial asset securitization investment trusts (FASITs) in the Apache deal, real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) in the Steele deal, and REMICs and real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the Cochise deal.\n\nThe special purpose entities were used for more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious to the fact that the special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special purpose entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.\n\nIn 1993, Enron established a joint venture in energy investments with CalPERS, the California state pension fund, called the Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI). In 1997, Skilling, serving as Chief Operating Officer (COO), asked CalPERS to join Enron in a separate investment. CalPERS was interested in the idea, but only if it could be terminated as a partner in JEDI. However, Enron did not want to show any debt from assuming CalPERS' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Fastow developed the special purpose entity Chewco Investments limited partnership (L.P.) which raised debt guaranteed by Enron and was used to acquire CalPERS's joint venture stake for $383 million. Because of Fastow's organization of Chewco, JEDI's losses were kept off of Enron's balance sheet.\n\nIn autumn 2001, CalPERS and Enron's arrangement was discovered, which required the discontinuation of Enron's prior accounting method for Chewco and JEDI. This disqualification revealed that Enron's reported earnings from 1997 to mid-2001 would need to be reduced by $405 million and that the company's indebtedness would increase by $628 million.\n\nWhitewing was the name of a special purpose entity used as a financing method by Enron. In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and other investments. Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought assets from Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock as collateral. Although the transactions were approved by the Enron board, the asset transfers were not true sales and should have been treated instead as loans.\n\nIn 1999, Fastow formulated two limited partnerships: LJM Cayman. L.P. (LJM1) and LJM2 Co-Investment L.P. (LJM2), for the purpose of buying Enron's poorly performing stocks and stakes to improve its financial statements. LJM 1 and 2 were created solely to serve as the outside equity investor needed for the special purpose entities that were being used by Enron. Fastow had to go before the board of directors to receive an exemption from Enron's code of ethics (as he had the title of CFO) in order to manage the companies. The two partnerships were funded with around $390 million provided by Wachovia, J.P. Morgan Chase, Credit Suisse First Boston, Citigroup, and other investors. Merrill Lynch, which marketed the equity, also contributed $22 million to fund the entities.\n\nEnron transferred to \"Raptor I-IV\", four LJM-related special purpose entities named after the velociraptors in \"Jurassic Park\", more than \"$1.2 billion in assets, including millions of shares of Enron common stock and long term rights to purchase millions more shares, plus $150 million of Enron notes payable\" as disclosed in the company's financial statement footnotes. The special purpose entities had been used to pay for all of this using the entities' debt instruments. The footnotes also declared that the instruments' face amount totaled $1.5 billion, and the entities notional amount of $2.1 billion had been used to enter into derivative contracts with Enron.\n\nEnron capitalized the Raptors, and, in a manner similar to the accounting employed when a company issues stock at a public offering, then booked the notes payable issued as assets on its balance sheet while increasing the shareholders' equity for the same amount. This treatment later became an issue for Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen as removing it from the balance sheet resulted in a $1.2 billion decrease in net shareholders' equity.\n\nEventually the derivative contracts worth $2.1 billion lost significant value. Swaps were established at the time the stock price achieved its maximum. During the ensuing year, the value of the portfolio under the swaps fell by $1.1 billion as the stock prices decreased (the loss of value meant that the special purpose entities technically now owed Enron $1.1 billion by the contracts). Enron, which used a \"mark-to-market\" accounting method, claimed a $500 million gain on the swap contracts in its 2000 annual report. The gain was responsible for offsetting its stock portfolio losses and was attributed to nearly a third of Enron's earnings for 2000 (before it was properly restated in 2001).\n\nOn paper, Enron had a model board of directors comprising predominantly outsiders with significant ownership stakes and a talented audit committee. In its 2000 review of best corporate boards, \"Chief Executive\" included Enron among its five best boards. Even with its complex corporate governance and network of intermediaries, Enron was still able to \"attract large sums of capital to fund a questionable business model, conceal its true performance through a series of accounting and financing maneuvers, and hype its stock to unsustainable levels.\"\n\nAlthough Enron's compensation and performance management system was designed to retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses. Employees constantly tried to start deals, often disregarding the quality of cash flow or profits, in order to get a better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to keep up with the company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.\n\nThe company was constantly emphasizing its stock price. Management was compensated extensively using stock options, similar to other U.S. companies. This policy of stock option awards caused management to create expectations of rapid growth in efforts to give the appearance of reported earnings to meet Wall Street's expectations. The stock ticker was located in lobbies, elevators, and on company computers. At budget meetings, Skilling would develop target earnings by asking \"What earnings do you need to keep our stock price up?\" and that number would be used, even if it was not feasible. On December 31, 2000, Enron had 96 million shares outstanding as stock option plans (approximately 13% of common shares outstanding). Enron's proxy statement stated that, within three years, these awards were expected to be exercised. Using Enron's January 2001 stock price of $83.13 and the directors' beneficial ownership reported in the 2001 proxy, the value of director stock ownership was $659 million for Lay, and $174 million for Skilling.\n\nSkilling believed that if employees were constantly worried about cost, it would hinder original thinking. As a result, extravagant spending was rampant throughout the company, especially among the executives. Employees had large expense accounts and many executives were paid sometimes twice as much as competitors. In 1998, the top 200 highest-paid employees received $193 million from salaries, bonuses, and stock. Two years later, the figure jumped to $1.4 billion.\n\nBefore its scandal, Enron was lauded for its sophisticated financial risk management tools. Risk management was crucial to Enron not only because of its regulatory environment, but also because of its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable fluctuation of future energy prices. Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.\n\nEnron's aggressive accounting practices were not hidden from the board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board did not have enough experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.\n\nEnron's auditor firm, Arthur Andersen, was accused of applying reckless standards in its audits because of a conflict of interest over the significant consulting fees generated by Enron. During 2000, Arthur Andersen earned $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in consulting fees (this amount accounted for roughly 27% of the audit fees of public clients for Arthur Andersen's Houston office). The auditor's methods were questioned as either being completed solely to receive its annual fees or for its lack of expertise in properly reviewing Enron's revenue recognition, special entities, derivatives, and other accounting practices.\n\nEnron hired numerous Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) as well as accountants who had worked on developing accounting rules with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The accountants searched for new ways to save the company money, including capitalizing on loopholes found in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the accounting industry's standards. One Enron accountant revealed \"We tried to aggressively use the literature [GAAP] to our advantage. All the rules create all these opportunities. We got to where we did because we exploited that weakness.\"\n\nAndersen's auditors were pressured by Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges from the special purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where the value of the entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.\n\nRevelations concerning Andersen's overall performance led to the break-up of the firm, and to the following assessment by the Powers Committee (appointed by Enron's board to look into the firm's accounting in October 2001): \"The evidence available to us suggests that Andersen did not fulfill its professional responsibilities in connection with its audits of Enron's financial statements, or its obligation to bring to the attention of Enron's Board (or the Audit and Compliance Committee) concerns about Enron's internal contracts over the related-party transactions\".\n\nCorporate Audit committees usually meet just a few times during the year, and their members typically have only modest experience with accounting and finance. Enron's audit committee had more expertise than many. It included:\n\nEnron's audit committee was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover large amounts of material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met for an hour and a half. Enron's audit committee did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.\n\nCommentators attributed the mismanagement behind Enron's fall to a variety of ethical and political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron's collapse resulted from the company's reliance on political lobbying, rent-seeking, and the gaming of regulations.\n\nEnron made a habit of booking costs of cancelled projects as assets, with the rationale that no official letter had stated that the project was cancelled. This method was known as \"the snowball\", and although it was initially dictated that such practices be used only for projects worth less than $90 million, it was later increased to $200 million.\n\nIn 1998, when analysts were given a tour of the Enron Energy Services office, they were impressed with how the employees were working so vigorously. In reality, Skilling had moved other employees to the office from other departments (instructing them to pretend to work hard) to create the appearance that the division was larger than it was. This ruse was used several times to fool analysts about the progress of different areas of Enron to help improve the stock price.\n\nIn February 2001, Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey told budget managers: \"From an accounting standpoint, this will be our easiest year ever. We've got 2001 in the bag.\" On March 5, Bethany McLean's \"Fortune\" article \"Is Enron Overpriced?\" questioned how Enron could maintain its high stock value, which was trading at 55 times its earnings. She argued that analysts and investors did not know exactly how Enron was earning its income. McLean was first drawn to the company's situation after an analyst suggested she view the company's 10-K report, where she found \"strange transactions\", \"erratic cash flow\", and \"huge debt.\" She telephoned Skilling to discuss her findings prior to publishing the article, but he called her \"unethical\" for not properly researching the company. Fastow cited two \"Fortune\" reporters that Enron could not reveal earnings details as the company had more than 1,200 trading books for assorted commodities and did \"...  not want anyone to know what's on those books. We don't want to tell anyone where we're making money.\"\n\nIn a conference call on April 17, 2001, then-Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Skilling verbally attacked Wall Street analyst Richard Grubman, who questioned Enron's unusual accounting practice during a recorded conference call. When Grubman complained that Enron was the only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements, Skilling stammered \"Well uh ... Thank you very much, we appreciate it ...  Asshole.\" This became an inside joke among many Enron employees, mocking Grubman for his perceived meddling rather than Skilling's offensiveness, with slogans such as \"Ask Why, Asshole\", a variation on Enron's official slogan \"Ask why\". However, Skilling's comment was met with dismay and astonishment by press and public, as he had previously disdained criticism of Enron coolly or humorously.\n\nBy the late 1990s Enron's stock was trading for $80–90 per share, and few seemed to concern themselves with the opacity of the company's financial disclosures. In mid-July 2001, Enron reported revenues of $50.1 billion, almost triple year-to-date, and beating analysts' estimates by 3 cents a share. Despite this, Enron's profit margin had stayed at a modest average of about 2.1%, and its share price had decreased by more than 30% since the same quarter of 2000.\n\nAs time passed, a number of serious concerns confronted the company. Enron had recently faced several serious operational challenges, namely logistical difficulties in operating a new broadband communications trading unit, and the losses from constructing the Dabhol Power project, a large gas powered power plant in India that had been mired in controvery since the beginning in relation to its high pricing and bribery at the highest level. These were subsequently confirmed in the 2002 Senate investigation. There was also increasing criticism of the company for the role that its subsidiary Enron Energy Services had in the California electricity crisis of 2000–2001.\n\nOn August 14, Skilling announced he was resigning his position as CEO after only six months. Skilling had long served as president and COO before being promoted to CEO. Skilling cited personal reasons for leaving the company. Observers noted that in the months before his exit, Skilling had sold at minimum 450,000 shares of Enron at a value of around $33 million (though he still owned over a million shares at the date of his departure). Nevertheless, Lay, who was serving as chairman at Enron, assured surprised market watchers that there would be \"no change in the performance or outlook of the company going forward\" from Skilling's departure. Lay announced he himself would re-assume the position of chief executive officer.\n\nThe next day, however, Skilling admitted that a very significant reason for his departure was Enron's faltering price in the stock market. The economist Paul Krugman asserted in his \"The New York Times\" column that Enron was an illustration of the consequences that occur from the deregulation and commodification of things such as energy. A few days later, in a letter to the editor, Kenneth Lay defended Enron and the philosophy of the company:\n\nOn August 15, Sherron Watkins, vice president for corporate development, sent an anonymous letter to Lay warning him about the company's accounting practices. One statement in the letter said: \"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals.\" Watkins contacted a friend who worked for Arthur Andersen and he drafted a memorandum to give to the audit partners about the points she raised. On August 22, Watkins met individually with Lay and gave him a six-page letter further explaining Enron's accounting issues. Lay questioned her as to whether she had told anyone outside of the company and then vowed to have the company's law firm, Vinson & Elkins, review the issues, although she argued that using the law firm would present a conflict of interest. Lay consulted with other executives, and although they wanted to dismiss Watkins (as Texas law did not protect company whistleblowers), they decided against it to prevent a lawsuit. On October 15, Vinson & Elkins announced that Enron had done nothing wrong in its accounting practices as Andersen had approved each issue.\n\nBy the end of August 2001, his company's stock value still falling, Lay named Greg Whalley, president and COO of Enron Wholesale Services and Mark Frevert, to positions in the chairman's office. Some observers suggested that Enron's investors were in significant need of reassurance, not only because the company's business was difficult to understand (even \"indecipherable\") but also because it was difficult to properly describe the company in financial statements. One analyst stated \"it's really hard for analysts to determine where [Enron] are making money in a given quarter and where they are losing money.\" Lay accepted that Enron's business was very complex, but asserted that analysts would \"never get all the information they want\" to satisfy their curiosity. He also explained that the complexity of the business was due largely to tax strategies and position-hedging. Lay's efforts seemed to meet with limited success; by September 9, one prominent hedge fund manager noted that \"[Enron] stock is trading under a cloud.\" The sudden departure of Skilling combined with the opacity of Enron's accounting books made proper assessment difficult for Wall Street. In addition, the company admitted to repeatedly using \"related-party transactions,\" which some feared could be too-easily used to transfer losses that might otherwise appear on Enron's own balance sheet. A particularly troubling aspect of this technique was that several of the \"related-party\" entities had been or were being controlled by CFO Fastow.\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, media attention shifted away from the company and its troubles; a little less than a month later Enron announced its intention to begin the process of selling its lower-margin assets in favor of its core businesses of gas and electricity trading. This policy included selling Portland General Electric to another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural Gas, for about $1.9 billion in cash and stock, and possibly selling its 65% stake in the Dabhol project in India.\n\nOn October 16, 2001, Enron announced that restatements to its financial statements for years 1997 to 2000 were necessary to correct accounting violations. The restatements for the period reduced earnings by $613 million (or 23% of reported profits during the period), increased liabilities at the end of 2000 by $628 million (6% of reported liabilities and 5.5% of reported equity), and reduced equity at the end of 2000 by $1.2 billion (10% of reported equity). Additionally, in January Jeff Skilling had asserted that the broadband unit alone was worth $35 billion, a claim also mistrusted. An analyst at Standard & Poor's said, \"I don't think anyone knows what the broadband operation is worth.\"\n\nEnron's management team claimed the losses were mostly due to investment losses, along with charges such as about $180 million in money spent restructuring the company's troubled broadband trading unit. In a statement, Lay revealed, \"After a thorough review of our businesses, we have decided to take these charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses.\" Some analysts were unnerved. David Fleischer at Goldman Sachs, an analyst termed previously 'one of the company's strongest supporters' asserted that the Enron management \"... lost credibility and have to reprove themselves. They need to convince investors these earnings are real, that the company is for real and that growth will be realized.\"\n\nFastow disclosed to Enron's board of directors on October 22 that he earned $30 million from compensation arrangements when managing the LJM limited partnerships. That day, the share price of Enron decreased to $20.65, down $5.40 in one day, after the announcement by the SEC that it was investigating several suspicious deals struck by Enron, characterizing them as \"some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen\". Attempting to explain the billion-dollar charge and calm investors, Enron's disclosures spoke of \"share settled costless collar arrangements,\" \"derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts,\" and strategies that served \"to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets.\" Such puzzling phraseology left many analysts feeling ignorant about just how Enron managed its business. Regarding the SEC investigation, chairman and CEO Lay said, \"We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest.\"\n\nTwo days later, on October 25, despite his reassurances days earlier, Lay dismissed Fastow from his position, citing \"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO.\" However, with Skilling and Fastow now both departed, some analysts feared that revealing the company's practices would be made all the more difficult. Enron's stock was now trading at $16.41, having lost half its value in a little more than a week.\n\nOn October 27 the company began buying back all its commercial paper, valued at around $3.3 billion, in an effort to calm investor fears about Enron's supply of cash. Enron financed the re-purchase by depleting its lines of credit at several banks. While the company's debt rating was still considered investment-grade, its bonds were trading at levels slightly less, making future sales problematic.\n\nAs the month came to a close, serious concerns were being raised by some observers regarding Enron's possible manipulation of accepted accounting rules; however, analysis was claimed to be impossible based on the incomplete information provided by Enron. Industry analysts feared that Enron was the new Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose bankruptcy in 1998 threatened systemic failure of the international financial markets. Enron's tremendous presence worried some about the consequences of the company's possible bankruptcy. Enron executives accepted questions in written form only.\n\nThe main short-term danger to Enron's survival at the end of October 2001 seemed to be its credit rating. It was reported at the time that Moody's and Fitch, two of the three biggest credit-rating agencies, had slated Enron for review for possible downgrade. Such a downgrade would force Enron to issue millions of shares of stock to cover loans it had guaranteed, which would decrease the value of existing stock further. Additionally, all manner of companies began reviewing their existing contracts with Enron, especially in the long term, in the event that Enron's rating were lowered below investment grade, a possible hindrance for future transactions.\n\nAnalysts and observers continued their complaints regarding the difficulty or impossibility of properly assessing a company whose financial statements were so cryptic. Some feared that no one at Enron apart from Skilling and Fastow could completely explain years of mysterious transactions. \"You're getting way over my head,\" said Lay during late August 2001 in response to detailed questions about Enron's business, a reaction that worried analysts.\n\nOn October 29, responding to growing concerns that Enron might have insufficient cash on hand, news spread that Enron was seeking a further $1–2 billion in financing from banks. The next day, as feared, Moody's lowered Enron's credit rating from Baa1 to Baa2, two levels above junk status. Standard & Poor's affirmed Enron's rating of BBB+, the equivalent of Moody's Baa1. Moody's also warned that it would downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, the consequence of which would likely prevent the company from finding the further financing it sought to keep solvent.\n\nNovember began with the disclosure that the SEC was now pursuing a formal investigation, prompted by questions related to Enron's dealings with \"related parties\". Enron's board also announced that it would commission a special committee to investigate the transactions, directed by William C. Powers, the dean of the University of Texas law school. The next day, an editorial in \"The New York Times\" demanded an \"aggressive\" investigation into the matter. Enron was able to secure an additional $1 billion in financing from cross-town rival Dynegy on November 2, but the news was not universally admired in that the debt was secured by assets from the company's valuable Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern Pipeline.\n\nSources claimed that Enron was planning to explain its business practices more fully within the coming days, as a confidence-building gesture. Enron's stock was now trading at around $7, as investors worried that the company would not be able to find a buyer.\n\nAfter it received a wide spectrum of rejections, Enron management apparently found a buyer when the board of Dynegy, another energy trader based in Houston, voted late at night on November 7 to acquire Enron at a very low price of about $8 billion in stock. Chevron Texaco, which at the time owned about a quarter of Dynegy, agreed to provide Enron with $2.5 billion in cash, specifically $1 billion at first and the rest when the deal was completed. Dynegy would also be required to assume nearly $13 billion of debt, plus any other debt hitherto occluded by the Enron management's secretive business practices, possibly as much as $10 billion in \"hidden\" debt. Dynegy and Enron confirmed their deal on November 8, 2001.\n\nCommentators remarked on the different corporate cultures between Dynegy and Enron, and on the \"straight-talking\" personality of the CEO of Dynegy, Charles Watson. Some wondered if Enron's troubles had not simply been the result of innocent accounting errors. By November, Enron was asserting that the billion-plus \"one-time charges\" disclosed in October should in reality have been $200 million, with the rest of the amount simply corrections of dormant accounting mistakes. Many feared other \"mistakes\" and restatements might yet be revealed.\n\nAnother major correction of Enron's earnings was announced on November 9, with a reduction of $591 million of the stated revenue of years 1997–2000. The charges were said to come largely from two special purpose partnerships (JEDI and Chewco). The corrections resulted in the virtual elimination of profit for fiscal year 1997, with significant reductions for the other years. Despite this disclosure, Dynegy declared it still intended to purchase Enron. Both companies were said to be anxious to receive an official assessment of the proposed sale from Moody's and S&P presumably to understand the effect the completion of any buyout transaction would have on Dynegy and Enron's credit rating. In addition, concerns were raised regarding antitrust regulatory restrictions resulting in possible divestiture, along with what to some observers were the radically different corporate cultures of Enron and Dynegy.\n\nBoth companies promoted the deal aggressively, and some observers were hopeful; Watson was praised for attempting to create the largest company on the energy market. At the time, Watson said: \"We feel [Enron] is a very solid company with plenty of capacity to withstand whatever happens the next few months.\" One analyst called the deal \"a whopper ... a very good deal financially, certainly should be a good deal strategically, and provides some immediate balance-sheet backstop for Enron.\"\n\nCredit issues were becoming more critical, however. Around the time the buyout was made public, Moody's and S&P both reduced Enron's rating to just one notch above junk status. Were the company's rating to fall below investment-grade, its ability to trade would be severely limited if there was a reduction or elimination of its credit lines with competitors. In a conference call, S&P affirmed that, were Enron not to be bought, S&P would reduce its rating to low BB or high B, ratings noted as being within junk status. Additionally, many traders had limited their involvement with Enron, or stopped doing business altogether, fearing more bad news. Watson again attempted to re-assure, attesting at a presentation to investors that there was \"nothing wrong with Enron's business\". He also acknowledged that remunerative steps (in the form of more stock options) would have to be taken to redress the animosity of many Enron employees towards management after it was revealed that Lay and other officials had sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock during the months prior to the crisis. The situation was not helped by the disclosure that Lay, his \"reputation in tatters\", stood to receive a payment of $60 million as a change-of-control fee subsequent to the Dynegy acquisition, while many Enron employees had seen their retirement accounts, which were based largely on Enron stock, ravaged as the price decreased 90% in a year. An official at a company owned by Enron stated \"We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as $800,000 or $900,000. It pretty much wiped out every employee's savings plan.\"\n\nWatson assured investors that the true nature of Enron's business had been made apparent to him: \"We have comfort there is not another shoe to drop. If there is no shoe, this is a phenomenally good transaction.\" Watson further asserted that Enron's energy trading part alone was worth the price Dynegy was paying for the whole company.\n\nBy mid-November, Enron announced it was planning to sell about $8 billion worth of underperforming assets, along with a general plan to reduce its scale for the sake of financial stability. On November 19 Enron disclosed to the public further evidence of its critical state of affairs. Most pressingly that the company had debt repayment obligations in the range of $9 billion by the end of 2002. Such debts were \"vastly in excess\" of its available cash. Also, the success of measures to preserve its solvency were not guaranteed, specifically as regarded asset sales and debt refinancing. In a statement, Enron revealed \"An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern.\"\n\nTwo days later, on November 21, Wall Street expressed serious doubts that Dynegy would proceed with its deal at all, or would seek to radically renegotiate. Furthermore, Enron revealed in a 10-Q filing that almost all the money it had recently borrowed for purposes including buying its commercial paper, or about $5 billion, had been exhausted in just 50 days. Analysts were unnerved at the revelation, especially since Dynegy was reported to have also been unaware of Enron's rate of cash use. In order to end the proposed buyout, Dynegy would need to legally demonstrate a \"material change\" in the circumstances of the transaction; as late as November 22, sources close to Dynegy were skeptical that the latest revelations constituted sufficient grounds.\n\nThe SEC announced it had filed civil fraud complaints against Andersen. A few days later, sources claimed Enron and Dynegy were renegotiating the terms of their arrangement. Dynegy now demanded Enron agree to be bought for $4 billion rather than the previous $8 billion. Observers were reporting difficulties in ascertaining which of Enron's operations, if any, were profitable. Reports described an en masse shift of business to Enron's competitors for the sake of risk exposure reduction.\n\nOn November 28, 2001, Enron's two worst-possible outcomes came true: Dynegy Inc. unilaterally disengaged from the proposed acquisition of the company, and Enron's credit rating was reduced to junk status. Watson later said \"At the end, you couldn't give it [Enron] to me.\" The company had very little cash with which to operate, let alone satisfy enormous debts. Its stock price fell to $0.61 at the end of the day's trading. One editorial observer wrote that \"Enron is now shorthand for the perfect financial storm.\"\n\nSystemic consequences were felt, as Enron's creditors and other energy trading companies suffered the loss of several percentage points. Some analysts felt Enron's failure indicated the risks of the post-September 11 economy, and encouraged traders to lock in profits where they could. The question now became how to determine the total exposure of the markets and other traders to Enron's failure. Early calculations estimated $18.7 billion. One adviser stated, \"We don't really know who is out there exposed to Enron's credit. I'm telling my clients to prepare for the worst.\"\n\nEnron was estimated to have about $23 billion in liabilities from both debt outstanding and guaranteed loans. Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase in particular appeared to have significant amounts to lose with Enron's bankruptcy. Additionally, many of Enron's major assets were pledged to lenders in order to secure loans, causing doubt about what, if anything, unsecured creditors and eventually stockholders might receive in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nEnron's European operations filed for bankruptcy on November 30, 2001, and it sought Chapter 11 protection two days later on December 2. It became the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, surpassing the 1970 bankruptcy of the Penn Central (WorldCom's bankruptcy the next year surpassed Enron's bankruptcy so the title was short held), and resulted in 4,000 lost jobs. The day that Enron filed for bankruptcy, the employees were told to pack their belongings and were given 30 minutes to vacate the building. Nearly 62% of 15,000 employees' savings plans relied on Enron stock that was purchased at $83 in early 2001 and was now practically worthless.\nOn January 17, 2002, Enron dismissed Arthur Andersen as its auditor, citing its accounting advice and the destruction of documents. Andersen countered that it had already ended its relationship with the company when Enron became bankrupt.\n\nFastow and his wife, Lea, both pleaded guilty to charges against them. Fastow was initially charged with 98 counts of fraud, money laundering, insider trading, and conspiracy, among other crimes. Fastow pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiracy and was sentenced to ten years with no parole in a plea bargain to testify against Lay, Skilling, and Causey. Lea was indicted on six felony counts, but prosecutors later dismissed them in favor of a single misdemeanor tax charge. Lea was sentenced to one year for helping her husband hide income from the government.\n\nLay and Skilling went on trial for their part in the Enron scandal in January 2006. The 53-count, 65-page indictment covers a broad range of financial crimes, including bank fraud, making false statements to banks and auditors, securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and insider trading. United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of insider trading. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison. In 2013 the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.\n\nLay pleaded not guilty to the eleven criminal charges, and claimed that he was misled by those around him. He attributed the main cause for the company's demise to Fastow. Lay was convicted of all six counts of securities and wire fraud for which he had been tried, and he was subject to a maximum total sentence of 45 years in prison. However, before sentencing was scheduled, Lay died on July 5, 2006. At the time of his death, the SEC had been seeking more than $90 million from Lay in addition to civil fines. The case of Lay's wife, Linda, is a difficult one. She sold roughly 500,000 shares of Enron ten minutes to thirty minutes before the information that Enron was collapsing went public on November 28, 2001. Linda was never charged with any of the events related to Enron.\n\nAlthough Michael Kopper worked at Enron for more than seven years, Lay did not know of Kopper even after the company's bankruptcy. Kopper was able to keep his name anonymous in the entire affair. Kopper was the first Enron executive to plead guilty. Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey was indicted with six felony charges for disguising Enron's financial condition during his tenure. After pleading not guilty, he later switched to guilty and was sentenced to seven years in prison.\n\nAll told, sixteen people pleaded guilty for crimes committed at the company, and five others, including four former Merrill Lynch employees, were found guilty. Eight former Enron executives testified—the main witness being Fastow—against Lay and Skilling, his former bosses. Another was Kenneth Rice, the former chief of Enron Corp.'s high-speed Internet unit, who cooperated and whose testimony helped convict Skilling and Lay. In June 2007, he received a 27-month sentence.\n\nMichael W. Krautz, a former Enron accountant, was among the accused who was acquitted of charges related to the scandal. Represented by Barry Pollack, Krautz was acquitted of federal criminal fraud charges after a month-long jury trial.\n\nArthur Andersen was charged with and found guilty of obstruction of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although only a small number of Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.\n\nGiles Darby, David Bermingham, and Gary Mulgrew worked for Greenwich NatWest. The three British men had worked with Fastow on a special purpose entity he had started called Swap Sub. When Fastow was being investigated by the SEC, the three men met with the British Financial Services Authority (FSA) in November 2001 to discuss their interactions with Fastow. In June 2002, the U.S. issued warrants for their arrest on seven counts of wire fraud, and they were then extradited. On July 12, a potential Enron witness scheduled to be extradited to the U.S., Neil Coulbeck, was found dead in a park in north-east London. Coulbeck's death was eventually ruled to have been a suicide. The U.S. case alleged that Coulbeck and others conspired with Fastow. In a plea bargain in November 2007, the trio plead guilty to one count of wire fraud while the other six counts were dismissed. Darby, Bermingham, and Mulgrew were each sentenced to 37 months in prison. In August 2010, Bermingham and Mulgrew retracted their confessions.\n\nEnron's shareholders lost $74 billion in the four years before the company's bankruptcy ($40 to $45 billion was attributed to fraud). As Enron had nearly $67 billion that it owed creditors, employees and shareholders received limited, if any, assistance aside from severance from Enron. To pay its creditors, Enron held auctions to sell assets including art, photographs, logo signs, and its pipelines.\n\nIn May 2004, more than 20,000 of Enron's former employees won a suit of $85 million for compensation of $2 billion that was lost from their pensions. From the settlement, the employees each received about $3,100. The next year, investors received another settlement from several banks of $4.2 billion. In September 2008, a $7.2-billion settlement from a $40-billion lawsuit, was reached on behalf of the shareholders. The settlement was distributed among the main plaintiff, University of California (UC), and 1.5 million individuals and groups. UC's law firm Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman and Robbins, received $688 million in fees, the highest in a U.S. securities fraud case. At the distribution, UC announced in a press release \"We are extremely pleased to be returning these funds to the members of the class. Getting here has required a long, challenging effort, but the results for Enron investors are unprecedented.\"\n\nBetween December 2001 and April 2002, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House Committee on Financial Services held multiple hearings about the Enron scandal and related accounting and investor protection issues. These hearings and the corporate scandals that followed Enron led to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on July 30, 2002. The Act is nearly \"a mirror image of Enron: the company's perceived corporate governance failings are matched virtually point for point in the principal provisions of the Act.\"\n\nThe main provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act included the establishment of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to develop standards for the preparation of audit reports; the restriction of public accounting companies from providing any non-auditing services when auditing; provisions for the independence of audit committee members, executives being required to sign off on financial reports, and relinquishment of certain executives' bonuses in case of financial restatements; and expanded financial disclosure of companies' relationships with unconsolidated entities.\n\nOn February 13, 2002, due to the instances of corporate malfeasances and accounting violations, the SEC recommended changes of the stock exchanges' regulations. In June 2002, the New York Stock Exchange announced a new governance proposal, which was approved by the SEC in November 2003. The main provisions of the final NYSE proposal include:\n\nKenneth Lay was a longtime supporter of U.S. president George W. Bush and a donor to his various political campaigns, including his successful bid for the presidency in 2000. As such, critics of Bush and his administration attempted to link them to the scandal. A January 2002 article in \"The Economist\" claimed that Lay had been a close personal friend of Bush's family and had backed him financially since his unsuccessful campaign for Congress in 1978. Allegedly, Lay was even rumored at one point to be in the running to serve as Secretary of Energy for Bush.\n\nIn an article that same month, \"Time\" magazine accused the Bush administration of making desperate attempts to distance themselves from the scandal. According to author Frank Pellegrini, various Bush appointments held connections to Enron, including deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove as a stockholder, Secretary of the Army Thomas White Jr. as a former executive, and SEC chairman Harvey Pitt, a former employee of Arthur Andersen. Former Montana governor Marc Racicot, whom Bush considered for appointment for Secretary of the Interior, briefly served as a lobbyist for the company after leaving office. After opening a criminal investigation into the scandal, Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself and his chief of staff from the case when Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman accused Ashcroft of receiving $25,000 from Enron for his failed reelection campaign to the Senate in 2000. As Pellegrini wrote, \"The Democrats will have the company-he-keeps, guilt-by-association thing on their side, and with all the ... general whiff of rich man's cover-up about the whole affair, they'll have a class warfare card to play this spring.\" \n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11587", "title": "Feminist theology", "text": "Feminist theology\n\nFeminist theology is a movement found in several religions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, and New Thought, to reconsider the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of those religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts and matriarchal religion.\n\nAccording to Grenz and Olson in their review of Feminist Theology, \"it was developed in three distinct steps. They begin with a critique of the past” such that they review the ways women have been oppressed; “they seek alternative biblical and extrabiblical traditions that support” the ideals Feminists are trying to advance; and finally “feminists set forth their own unique method of theology, which includes the revisioning of Christian categories.” Grenz and Olson also mention, however, while all feminists agree there is a flaw in the system, there is disagreement over how far outside of the Bible and the Christian tradition women are willing to go to seek support for their ideals.\n\nIt has frequently been said that feminist theology draws on women's experience as a basic source of content as well as a criterion of truth.\nThere has been a tendency to treat this principle of \"experience\" as unique to feminist theology (or, perhaps to liberation theologies) and to see it as distant from \"objective\" source of truth of classical theologies. This seems to be a misunderstanding of the experimental base of all theological reflection. What have been called the objective sources of theology; Scripture and tradition, are themselves codified collective human experience.\n\nThe primacy of a monotheistic or near-monotheistic \"Great Goddess\" is advocated by some modern matriarchists as a female version of, preceding, or analogue to, the Abrahamic God associated with the historical rise of monotheism in the Mediterranean Axis Age.\n\nMother Nature (sometimes known as \"Mother Earth\") is a common representation of nature that focuses on the life-giving and nurturing features of nature by embodying it in the form of the mother. Images of women representing mother earth, and mother nature, are timeless. In prehistoric times, goddesses were worshipped for their association with fertility, fecundity, and agricultural bounty. Priestesses held dominion over aspects of Incan, Assyrian, Babylonian, Slavonic, Roman, Greek, Indian, and Iroquoian religions in the millennia prior to the inception of Patriarchal religion.\n\nOthers who practice feminist spirituality may instead adhere to a feminist re-interpretation of Western monotheistic traditions. In those cases, the notion of God as having a male gender is rejected, and God is not referred to using male pronouns. Feminist spirituality may also object to images of God that they perceive as authoritarian, parental, or disciplinarian, instead emphasizing \"maternal\" attributes such as nurturing, acceptance, and creativity.\n\nCarol P. Christ is the author of the widely reprinted essay \"Why Women Need the Goddess\", which argues in favor of the concept of there having been an ancient religion of a supreme goddess. This essay was presented as the keynote address to an audience of over 500 at the \"Great Goddess Re-emerging\" conference at the University of Santa Cruz in the spring of 1978, and was first published in \"Heresies: The Great Goddess Issue\" (1978), pgs. 8-13. Carol P. Christ also co-edited the classic feminist religion anthologies \"Weaving the Visions: New Patterns in Feminist Spirituality\" (1989) and \"Womanspirit Rising\" (1979/1989); the latter included her essay \"Why Women Need the Goddess\".\n\nNew Thought as a movement had no single origin, but was rather propelled along by a number of spiritual thinkers and philosophers and emerged through a variety of religious denominations and churches, particularly the Unity Church, Religious Science, and Church of Divine Science. It was a feminist movement in that most of its teachers and students were women; notable among the founders of the movement were Emma Curtis Hopkins, known as the \"teacher of teachers\" Myrtle Fillmore, Malinda Cramer, and Nona L. Brooks; with its churches and community centers mostly led by women, from the 1880s to today.\n\nJewish feminism is a movement that seeks to make the religious, legal, and social status of Jewish women equal to that of Jewish men. Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major branches of Judaism.\n\nVarious versions of feminist theology exist within the Jewish community.\n\nSome of these theologies promote the idea that it is important to have a feminine characterisation of God within the siddur (Jewish prayerbook) and service.\n\nIn 1976, Rita Gross published the article \"Female God Language in a Jewish Context\" (Davka Magazine 17), which Jewish scholar and feminist Judith Plaskow considers \"probably the first article to deal theoretically with the issue of female God-language in a Jewish context\".  Gross was Jewish herself at this time.\n\nReconstructionist Rabbi Rebecca Alpert (\"Reform Judaism\", Winter 1991) comments:\n\nIn 1990 Rabbi Margaret Wenig wrote the sermon, \"God Is a Woman and She Is Growing Older\", which as of 2011 has been published ten times (three times in German) and preached by rabbis from Australia to California.\n\nRabbi Paula Reimers (\"Feminism, Judaism, and God the Mother\", \"Conservative Judaism\" 46 (1993)) comments:\nAhuva Zache affirms that using both masculine and feminine language for God can be a positive thing, but reminds her Reform Jewish readership that God is beyond gender (\"Is God male, female, both or neither? How should we phrase our prayers in response to God’s gender?\", in the Union for Reform Judaism's iTorah, ):\n\nThese views are highly controversial even within liberal Jewish movements. Orthodox Jews and many Conservative Jews\nhold that it is wrong to use English female pronouns for God, viewing such usage as an intrusion of modern feminist ideology into Jewish tradition. Liberal prayerbooks tend increasingly to also avoid male-specific words and pronouns, seeking that all references to God in translations be made in gender-neutral language. For example, the UK Liberal movement's \"Siddur Lev Chadash\" (1995) does so, as does the UK Reform Movement's \"Forms of Prayer\" (2008). In Mishkan T'filah, the American Reform Jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to God as “He” have been removed, and whenever Jewish patriarchs are named (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), so also are the matriarchs (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah.) In 2015 the Reform Jewish High Holy Days prayer book Mishkan HaNefesh was released; it is intended as a companion to Mishkan T'filah. It includes a version of the High Holy Days prayer Avinu Malkeinu that refers to God as both \"Loving Father\" and \"Compassionate Mother.\" Other notable changes are replacing a line from the Reform movement’s earlier prayerbook, \"Gates of Repentance,\" that mentioned the joy of a bride and groom specifically, with the line \"rejoicing with couples under the chuppah [wedding canopy]\", and adding a third, non-gendered option to the way worshippers are called to the Torah, offering “mibeit,” Hebrew for “from the house of,” in addition to the traditional “son of” or “daughter of.”\n\nIn 2003 \"The Female Face of God in Auschwitz: A Jewish Feminist Theology of the Holocaust\", the first full-length feminist theology of the Holocaust, written by Melissa Raphael, was published. Judith Plaskow’s \"Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective\" (1991), and Rachel Adler’s \"Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics\" (1999) are the only two full-length Jewish feminist works to focus entirely on theology in general (rather than specific aspects such as Holocaust theology.) Thus, \"Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective\" (1991) is the first book of Jewish feminist theology ever written.\n\nChristian feminism is an aspect of feminist theology which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Christian perspective. Christian feminists argue that contributions by women in that direction are necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. Christian feminists believe that God does not discriminate on the basis of biologically determined characteristics such as sex and race. Their major issues include the ordination of women, male dominance in Christian marriage, recognition of equal spiritual and moral abilities, reproductive rights, and the search for a feminine or gender-transcendent divine. Christian feminists often draw on the teachings of other religions and ideologies in addition to biblical evidence.\n\nTwo authors whose works are vital to an understanding of feminist theology are Mary Daly and Rosemary Radford Ruether.\n\nMary Daly grew up an Irish Catholic and all of her education was received through Catholic schools. She has three doctorate degrees. One from St. Mary’s College in sacred theology, and two from University of Fribourg, Switzerland in theology and philosophy. From 1966 till the end of her career she taught at Boston College. While in her early works Daly expressed a desire to reform Christianity from the inside, she would later come to the same point as several other feminists, that Christianity is not able to enact the necessary changes as it is. (Prologue Daly). “On November 14, 1971, when she was invited to be the first woman to preach at Harvard Memorial Chapel. She used the opportunity to denounce Christianity as irredeemable for women and to call for women (and men) to make an exodus from the Church. Almost all the women who attended this service walked out with her, as well as a few men.” Her works include: \"The Church and the Second Sex\" (1968), \"Beyond God the Father\" (1973), \"Gyn/ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism\" (1978), \"Pure Lust: Elemental Feminist Philosophy\" (1984), \"Webster’s First Intergalactic Wickedary of the English Language\" (1987), and \"Outercourse: The Be-Dazzling Voyage\" (1992). According to Ford’s The Modern Theologians, “Mary Daly has done more than anyone to clarify the problems women have concerning the central core symbolism of Christianity, and its effects on their self-understanding and their relationship to God.”\n\nRosemary Radford Ruether grew up Roman Catholic and attended Catholic schools through her sophomore year of high school. She was a classics major at Scripps College, worked for the Delta Ministry in 1965 and taught at Howard University School of Religion from 1966 to 1976. She has also “been responsible for the production of some twenty-two books…and at least five hundred articles.” “Rosemary Ruether has written on the question of Christian credibility, with particular attention to ecclesiology and its engagement with church-world conflicts; Jewish-Christian relations…; politics and religion in America; and Feminism\".\n\nIn the 1970s Phyllis Trible pioneered a Christian feminist approach to biblical scholarship, using the approach of rhetorical criticism developed by her dissertation advisor, James Muilenburg.\n\nChristian feminist theology has sometimes been critiqued as being focused on white women. This has resulted in the development of movements such as womanist theology, Asian feminist theology, and mujerista theology.\n\nThe term Christian egalitarianism is sometimes preferred by those advocating gender equality and equity among Christians who do not wish to associate themselves with the feminist movement.\nWomen apologists have become more visible in Christian academia. Their defense of the faith is differentiated by a more personal, cultural and listening approach \"driven by love\".\n\nSee also: Unity Church, Christian Science, Christian theological praxis and Postmodern Christianity.\n\nIslamic feminism is a form of feminism concerned with the role of women in Islam. It aims for the full equality of all Muslims, regardless of gender, in public and private life. Islamic feminists advocate women's rights, gender equality, and social justice grounded in an Islamic framework. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilised secular and European or non-Muslim feminist discourses and recognise the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement. Advocates of the movement seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran (holy book), \"hadith\" (sayings of Muhammad) and \"sharia\" (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society. Muslim majority countries have produced more than seven female heads of state, including Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, Mame Madior Boye of Senegal, Tansu Çiller of Turkey, and Megawati Sukarnoputri of Indonesia. Bangladesh was the first country in the world to have consecutive, elected, female heads of state: Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina.\n\nIn Sikhism women are equal to men, see the verse from the Sikh scripture the Guru Granth Sahib\n\n\"From woman, man is born;\nwithin woman, man is conceived; to woman he is engaged and married.\nWoman becomes his friend; through woman, the future generations come.\nWhen his woman dies, he seeks another woman; to woman he is bound.\nSo why call her bad? From her, kings are born.\nFrom woman, woman is born; without woman, there would be no one at all.\"\n\n— Guru Nanak\n\nWithin Ancient Hinduism, women have been held in equal honour as men. Manusmriti for example states: \"The society that provides respect and dignity to women flourishes with nobility and prosperity. And a society that does not put women on such a high pedestal has to face miseries and failures regardless of how so much noble deeds they perform otherwise.\" Manusmrithi Chapter 3 Verse 56.\n\nWithin the Vedas the Hindu holy texts, women were given the highest possible respect and equality. The Vedic period was glorified by this tradition. Many rishis were women. Indeed, several of them authored many of the slokas in the Vedas. For instance, in the Rigveda there is a list of women rishis. Some of them are: Ghosha, Godha, Gargi, Vishwawra, Apala, Upanishad, Brahmjaya, Aditi, Indrani, Sarma, Romsha, Maitreyi, Kathyayini, Urvashi, Lopamudra, Yami, Shashwati, Sri, Laksha and many others. In the Vedic period women were free to enter into brahmacharya just like men, and attain salvation.\n\nDuring Hindu marriage ceremonies the following slokas are uttered by the grooms but, these days, their import little understood or ever attempted to understand.\n\n\"O bride! I accept your hand to enhance our joint good fortune. I pray to you to accept me as your husband and live with me until our old age. ...\" \"Rigveda Samhita\" Part -4, sukta 85, sloka 9702\n\n\"O bride! May you be like the empress of your mother-in-law, father-in-law, sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law (sisters and brothers of the groom). May your writ run in your house.\" \"Rigveda Samhita\" Part -4, sukta 85, sloka 9712\n\nThis beautifully lyrical sloka from the Atharvaveda clearly states that the woman leads and the man follows: \"The Sun God follows the first illuminated and enlightened goddess Usha (dawn) in the same manner as men emulate and follow women.\" \"Athravaveda Samhita\", Part 2, Kanda 27, sukta 107, sloka 5705.\n\nWomen were considered to be the embodiment of great virtue and wisdom. Thus we have: \"O bride! May the knowledge of the Vedas be in front of you and behind you, in your centre and in your ends. May you conduct your life after attaining the knowledge of the Vedas. May you be benevolent, the harbinger of good fortune and health and live in great dignity and indeed illuminate your husband's home.\" \"Atharva Veda\" 14-1-64. Women were allowed full freedom of worship. \"The wife should do agnihotra (yagna), sandhya (puja) and all other daily religious rituals. If, for some reason, her husband is not present, the woman alone has full rights to do yagna\". \"Rigveda Samhita\", part 1, sukta 79, sloka 872.\n\nMoving on towards the Monotheistic era of Hinduism when such ideals such as Shaivism and Vaishnavism, a specific deity for feministic worship was bought about under the Shaktism branch. From a Hinduism point of view women are equal in all measures to men in comparison.\n\nSome currents of Neopaganism, in particular Wicca, have a ditheistic concept of a single goddess and a single god, who in hieros gamos represent a united whole. Polytheistic reconstructionists focus on reconstructing polytheistic religions, including the various goddesses and figures associated with indigenous cultures.\n\nThe term \"thealogy\" is sometimes used in the context of the Neopagan Goddess movement, a pun on theology and \"thea\" θεά \"goddess\" intended to suggest a feminist approach to theism.\n\nThe Goddess movement is a loose grouping of social and religious phenomena that grew out of second-wave feminism, predominantly in North America, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand in the 1970s, and the metaphysical community as well. Spurred by the perception that women were not treated equitably in many religions, some women turned to a Female Deity as more in tune with their spiritual needs. Education in the Arts became a vehicle for the study of humanitarian philosophers like David Hume at that time. A unifying theme of this diverse movement is the femaleness of Deity (as opposed and contrasted to a patriarchal God).\n\nGoddess beliefs take many forms: some people in the Goddess movement recognize multiple goddesses; some also include gods; others honour what they refer to as \"the Goddess,\" which is not necessarily seen as monotheistic, but is often understood to be an inclusive, encompassing term incorporating many goddesses in many different cultures. The term \"the Goddess\" may also be understood to include a multiplicity of ways to view deity personified as female, or as a metaphor, or as a process. (Christ 1997, 2003) The term \"The Goddess\" may also refer to the concept of The One Divine Power, or the traditionally worshipped \"Great Goddess\" of ancient times.\n\nIn the latter part of the 20th century, feminism was influential in the rise of Neopaganism in the United States, and particularly the Dianic tradition. Some feminists find the worship of a goddess, rather than a god, to be consonant with their views. Others are polytheists, and worship a number of goddesses. The collective set of beliefs associated with this is sometimes known as thealogy and sometimes referred to as the Goddess movement. See also Dianic Wicca.\n\nBuddhist feminism seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective and within Buddhism.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19741098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19741098", "title": "Harlem Children's Zone", "text": "Harlem Children's Zone\n\nThe Harlem Children's Zone (HCZ) is a non-profit organization for poverty-stricken children and families living in Harlem, providing free support in the form of parenting workshops, a pre-school program, three charter schools, and child-oriented health programs for thousands of children and families. The HCZ is \"aimed at doing nothing less than breaking the cycle of generational poverty for the thousands of children and\nfamilies it serves.\" In part because not enough time has passed, there is not evidence available that the HCZ achieves its central goal.\n\nThe Harlem Children's Zone Project has expanded the HCZ's comprehensive system of programs to nearly 100 blocks of Central Harlem and aims to keep children on track through college and into the job market.\n\nThe HCZ and its promotion as a model of education to aspire to, especially in the recent documentary \"Waiting for \"Superman\",\" have been criticized as an example of the privatization of education in the U.S. University of San Francisco Adjunct Professor in Education, Rick Ayers writes that \"Waiting for \"Superman\"\" \"never mentions the tens of millions of dollars of private money that has poured into the Harlem Children's Zone, the model and superman we are relentlessly instructed to aspire to.\" One year after this film was made, the Grassroots Education Movement made a film titled \"The Inconvenient Truth Behind Waiting for Superman\", which accused the original film of exaggerating the success of the HCZ.\n\nThe Obama administration announced a Promise Neighborhoods program, which hopes to replicate the success of the HCZ in poverty-stricken areas of other U.S. cities. In the summer of 2010, the U.S. Department of Education's Promise Neighborhoods program accepted applications from over 300 communities for $10 million in federal grants for developing HCZ implementation plans.\n\nThe HCZ designs, funds, and operates a holistic system of education, social-services and community-building programs in Harlem to counter the negative influences of crime, drugs and poverty and help children complete college and go on to the job market. Providing this \"full network of services... to an entire neighborhood from birth to college\" is a key element of the Obama administration's Promise Neighborhoods program modeled after the HCZ.\n\nThe two fundamental principles of The Zone Project are to help kids as early in their lives as possible and to create a critical mass of adults around them who understand what it takes to help children succeed.\n\nComponents of the HCZ programs include the following:\n\nThrough its \"pipeline program design\", the Harlem's Children Zone ensures that a child is never neglected; having a range of programs that are geared and targeted to both the parents,and children for every stage in life. In addition to early childhood programs, such as Baby College, mentioned above, The Harlem's Children Zone has programs for school aged children through its Promise Academy K-12 Charter Schools. The comprehensive and wholesome programs that are available to not only the students, but the parents of students, in the Promise Academy include counseling and benefits assistance. Not all students are able to be granted admission to the Promise Academy K-12 Charter Schools, students are accepted based on a lottery system. Children within the Harlem's Children Zone who are not chosen through the lottery system can participate in programs such as Peacemakers, which provides academic support to thousands of students in the various public schools in the zone. Physical, mental, and emotional well-being of children are ensured through other programs such as the Case Management program for middle-school aged children; this program assigns an HCZ staff member to monitor a child's progress. Passed the K-12 system, students receive help from the Harlem Children's Zone College Success Office, which helps students become not only high school graduates, but college graduates.\n\nA number of large U.S. cities have initiated their own programs styled after the HCZ, in advance of any federally funded efforts stemming from the Obama administration's HCZ-inspired anti-poverty initiatives. Philadelphia, \nMiami,\nChicago,\nCleveland,\nand cities in Maryland, are planning or considering HCZ replication.\n\nAuthor Paul Tough has discussed the HCZ replication proposal.\n\nThe HCZ, in partnership with PolicyLink, organized a two-day conference on November 9–10, 2009 in New York City with the aim of providing guidance to community leaders from around the U.S. in their efforts to launch similar, large-scale projects like the HCZ in their areas.\n\nIn 2008 President Obama, inspired by the Harlem Children's Zone immense progress toward breaking the generational cycle of poverty, proposed the creation of Promise Neighborhoods. Obama's commitment to alleviating poverty is put into place with this initiative which uses HCZ's \"cradle to college\" approach. \"The initiative seeks to help selected local communities dramatically improve outcomes and opportunities for children and families in defined neighborhoods. The initiative will be diverse in its application, reflecting local needs and context.\" The initiative's goal follows the HCZ's paradigm to improve every aspect of life in impoverished communities, its purpose states: \"all children growing up in Promise Neighborhoods have access to effective schools and strong systems of family and community support that will prepare them to attain an excellent education and successfully transition from college to career.\" This purpose statement directly reflects the mission of HCZ. HCZ, in collaboration with the national action institute PolicyLink, assists in providing ongoing guidance for the Obama administration in this initiative.\n\nIn 2010, the Obama administration allocated $75 million in the federal budget for the program. More than 330 communities across the nation applied for Promise Neighborhood planning grants. Twenty-one communities were awarded one-year grants between $400,000 and $500,000. Planning grantees are given a year to produce a strategic paradigm which will address the issues specific to their community in pursuit of an implementation grant. The grantees submitted their plans that summer, with the implementation phase for Promise Neighborhoods expected to begin in September 2011.\n\nThe \"60 Minutes\" television program profiled the HCZ, including an interview with founder Geoffrey Canada, on 14 May 2006 and a follow up program on December 6, 2009. Canada has also appeared twice in televised interviews with Charlie Rose on 2 January 2008 and 22 June 2004,\nand with Stephen Colbert on 8 December 2008, on 20 July 2009, and on 4 January 2011.\n\n\"The New York Times\" ran an article on October 12, 2010, \"Lauded Harlem Schools Have Their Own Problems,\" in which they exposed the \"low student performance in most of the neighborhood's public schools\" and the dismissal, by the board of trustees, of an entire class of 8th graders when their performance was deemed \"too weak to found a high school on.\" They also report that \"because it lost more ground than comparable schools, it got a C from the city on its annual A-to-F report card, and an F in the student progress category,\" while giving credit for the increased math scores of many students in the school.\n\nThe U.S. radio show \"This American Life\" produced an episode about the HCZ which aired on 26 September 2008, 11 October 2008, and 14 August 2009.\n\nBarack Obama announced his plan in a 2008 presidential campaign speech in Washington, D.C. to replicate the HCZ in 20 cities across the United States. Federal government would provide half of the funding with the rest coming from philanthropy and businesses at a cost of a few billion per year.\nSenator Obama also noted the HCZ in a 2007 campaign speech.\n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" featured the HCZ in an article about the financial troubles experienced by this and other charitable organizations in the wake of the recession.\nThe HCZ initiated a 100-day public service campaign started on January 23, 2009 to help counteract the effects of the economic downturn.\n\nAn article in the January/February 2009 issue of \"Mother Jones\" showcases Geoffrey Canada, the HCZ, and its recognition by the Obama 2008 presidential campaign and administration. The author of this article, Paul Tough, published a book in August 2008 about the HCZ titled, \"Whatever It Takes: Geoffrey Canada's Quest to Change Harlem and America.\"\n\nNational Public Radio produced a 30-minute story on the HCZ on 28 July 2009 titled \"Harlem Children's Zone Breaks Poverty Pattern.\"\n\nThe \"Washington Post\" published a story about the HCZ on 2 August 2009, noting that the Obama administration has set aside $10 million in the 2010 budget for planning its Promise Neighborhoods program, which seeks to replicate the HCZ.\n\n18 March 2010, the HCZ was covered in the BBC's flagship \"Today\" programme with a view to possible recreation in Great Britain.\n\nIn part because not enough time has passed, there is not evidence available to know whether the HCZ achieves its central goal of ending intergenerational poverty.\n\nHCZ has had many impacts, on its students, community, and federal programs. President Obama created a grant program to copy HCZ's block-by-block approach to ending poverty. Obama requested $210 million for the program.\n\nThirty-eight percent of Promise Academy I's students in third through sixth grade passed the 2010 English test, placing it in the lower half of charter schools citywide and below the city's overall passing rate of 42 percent. It outperformed Harlem as a whole, where just 29 percent of children passed.\n\nPromise Academy II, an elementary school that occupies part of a public school building, did better, with 62 percent passing in English, among the top 10 percent of charters. But because it lost more ground than comparable schools, it got a C from the city on its annual A-to-F report card and an F in the student progress category. Both schools continued to outperform the city in math, with 60 percent passing in one school and 81 percent in the other.\n\nOne Harvard study found that Promise Academy students who entered the sixth grade in 2005 had raised their test scores so much by the eighth grade that they had \"reversed the black-white achievement gap in mathematics\" and reduced it in English. In 2009, nearly all the students passed the math test.\n\nHCZ's after-school college advice office has helped place 650 students in college. Its asthma initiative has drastically reduced emergency room visits and missed school days among its 1,000 participants. Preschool students have made bounds in kindergarten readiness. Parent satisfaction in the charter schools, as measured by city surveys, is high.\n\nA Brookings report finds that the HCZ increased middle school math test scores more than other academic indicators, yet it finds inconclusive data to support the holistic approach taken by the HCZ. For elementary school years, however, some research has concluded that the HCZ has positive impacts on both math and English language arts.\n\nA March 2010 report in \"City Limits\" discusses the \"stunning rate of teacher turnover the Promise Academies have posted. In 2006-07, a third of Promise Academy I's teachers left or were dismissed. The year before 48 percent were fired or quit. Only one of the original teachers is still with the Promise Academy middle school.\" It goes on to quote the treasurer of the board of the HCZ, Mitch Kurz as saying, \"We developed a lot of grand plans, educational philosophies, and we overlooked sort of the fundamental aspect of running a successful school, and that is managing the culture of the school.\"\n\n\nHCZ.org\n"}
{"id": "2128281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2128281", "title": "International environmental agreement", "text": "International environmental agreement\n\nAn international environmental agreement or sometimes environmental protocol, is a type of treaty binding in international law, allowing them to reach an environmental goal. In other words, it is \"an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources.\" An agreement between two nations is known as a bilateral environmental agreement.\n\nIf the agreement is made among three or more nations, it is called a multilateral environmental agreement (MEA). Such agreements, primarily produced by the United Nations, cover subjects such as atmospheric policies, freshwater policies, hazardous waste and substance policies, the marine environment, nature conservation policies, noise pollution and nuclear safety. \n\nThe use of multilateral environment agreements began in 1857, when a German agreement regulated the flow of water from Lake Constance to Austria and Switzerland. International environmental protocols came to feature in environmental governance after trans-boundary environmental problems became widely perceived in the 1960s.\n\nBetween 1857 and 2012, a total of 747 multilateral environmental agreements have been concluded. Following the Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated. MEAs were popularized by the United Nations, the majority of MEAs have been implemented since the 1972 at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (also known as the Stockholm Conference). The Stockholm Declaration was adopted by all 113 countries in attendance at the conference, and was the first universal document of importance on an environmental issue.\n\nA complex networking system is needed for a functional MEA system. Levels of government within a nation may impede each other about climate change (for example) due to opposing views or parties, making implementation more difficult and impacting external relationships.\n\nPolicies surrounding an MEA are determined by the participating countries. The United Nations and the World Trade Organization are key intergovernmental organizations for forging and implementating the agreements.\n\nProtocols can take flexible approaches to improve effectiveness. One example is the use of sanctions: under the Montreal Protocol, signatories were forbidden to purchase chlorofluorocarbons from nonsignatories, in order to prevent any windfall benefits. Funding has also been used to overcome North-South conflict: members of the Montreal Protocol created a fund of $240 million to redistribute the costs of transition. Differential obligations as seen in the Kyoto Protocol can also encourage wider participation.\n\nWhile protocols appear to be the ultimate top-down mode of governance, having \"scant provisions for public participation,\" it is widely thought that the influence of transnational networks has been growing Public opinion is relevant, as concern must exist to prompt action and dedication of government resources. Non-governmental organizations also fulfill certain roles, from gathering information and devising policies to mobilising support. Science plays an important part, although Susskind asserts that sometimes this role is diminished by uncertainty, disagreement, and the rise of \"adversary science.\" The business community can also be involved with positive outcomes.\n\nHow we view the effectiveness of protocols depends on what we expect from them. With little administrative force or actual power, protocols succeed in increasing government concern, enhancing the contractual environment, and heightening capacity through transfer of assets. Yet as long as sovereignty is intact, environmental protocols will not affect changes in the face of state or public apathy, guarantee national action, or materialize overnight. The progress of international environmental law might be, as Wiener suggests, like the tortoise, slow but steady.\n\nThe world's existing political systems pose barriers to the creation of environmental protocols. First, maintenance of sovereignty means that no country can be forced to participate, only urged to do so. Consequently, as French states, \"International law has the force of moral suasion, but few real teeth.\" Second, North-South conflict can block cooperation: the countries in the global South generally see the countries of the North as needing to take responsibility for environmental degradation and make significant changes in their way of living, neither of which the North deems reasonable. \n\nFinally, countries may lack motivation to change their environmental policies due to conflict with other interests, especially economic prosperity. If environmental protocols will cause economic difficulties or harm to a country, it may shirk the protocols while other countries adhere to them, creating a classic free-rider problem. Additionally, environmental protocols may be criticized for scientific uncertainty, or at least a lack of synthesis of scientific information, which may be used for \"blocking interests and doing mischief.\"\n\nDue to these barriers, environmental protocols become an obvious target for several criticisms, such as being slow to produce the desired effects (due to the convention-protocol-ratification-implementation process), tending to the lowest common denominator, and lacking monitoring and enforcement. They can also be criticized for taking an incremental approach where sustainable development principles suggest that environmental concern should be mainstreamed.\n\nThe United Nations is involved in MEAs worldwide on a number of issues, including biological diversity, chemicals and waste, and climate and the atmosphere. One example would be the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, which was brought together to address the hazardous effects of Chlorofluorocarbons on the atmosphere. The United Nations Information Portal (InforMEA) brings together MEAs by harvesting COP decisions and resolutions, news, events, MEA membership, national focal points, national reports and implementation plans from MEA secretariats and organizes this information around a set of agreed terms, for the benefit of Parties and the environment community at large\n\nThe World Trade Organization has been involved in MEA negotiations due to the agreements' trade implications. The organization has trade and environmental policies which promote the protection and preservation of the environment. Its objective is to reduce trade barriers and coordinate trade-related measures with environmental policies. Since MEAs protect and preserve the environment, they may help ease restrictions on trade. The WTO’s principles are based on non-discrimination, free trade through reduction of trade barriers and fair competition, and MEAs have been rejected for not being in accordance with the organization's principles. The WTO is working with and implementing over 350 MEAs worldwide. Most of the agreements involve five core countries which are committed to environmental improvement and free trade. WTO members are legally bound to respect negotiated reductions of barriers to trade. However, conflict has arisen due to trade restriction.\n\nAustralia is noted for its wide variety of animal species and diverse environment, which includes beaches, deserts and mountains, and climate change is a major concern. The country is under the largest ozone hole in the world, with environmental impact. Australia's proximity to Antarctica raises concerns about sea-level rise and changes in ocean currents which influence climate.\n\nCanada's multilateral environmental agreements encompass air, biodiversity and ecosystems, chemicals and waste, climate change, environmental cooperation, marine and the oceans, and meteorology. Canada has taken an initiative due to the country's variety of natural resources, climates and populated areas, all of which can contribute to environmental stress.\n\nThe United States has committed to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and global negotiations on mercury. The number of MEAs in which the U.S. is involved is substantially lower than Canada's, despite its greater population and larger carbon footprint and economy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31649843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31649843", "title": "International use of the U.S. dollar", "text": "International use of the U.S. dollar\n\nBesides being the main currency of the United States, the American dollar is used as the standard unit of currency in international markets for commodities such as gold and petroleum (the latter, sometimes called petrocurrency, is the source of the term petrodollar). Some non-U.S. companies dealing in globalized markets, such as Airbus, list their prices in dollars.\n\nThe U.S. dollar is the world's foremost reserve currency. In addition to holdings by central banks and other institutions, there are many private holdings, which are believed to be mostly in one-hundred-dollar banknotes (indeed, most American banknotes actually are held outside the United States). All holdings of U.S.-dollar bank deposits held by non-residents of the United States are known as \"eurodollars\" (not to be confused with the euro), regardless of the location of the bank holding the deposit (which may be inside or outside the U.S.).\n\nEconomist Paul Samuelson and others (including, at his death, Milton Friedman) have maintained that the overseas demand for dollars allows the United States to maintain persistent trade deficits without causing the value of the currency to depreciate or the flow of trade to readjust. But Samuelson stated in 2005 that at some uncertain future period these pressures would precipitate a run against the U.S. dollar with serious global financial consequences.\n\nThe U.S. dollar is an important international reserve currency along with the euro. The euro inherited this status from the German mark, and since its introduction, has increased its standing considerably, mostly at the expense of the dollar. Despite the dollar's recent losses to the euro, it is still by far the major international reserve currency, with an accumulation more than double that of the euro.\n\nIn August 2007, two scholars affiliated with the government of the People's Republic of China threatened to sell its substantial reserves in American dollars in response to American legislative discussion of trade sanctions designed to revalue the Chinese yuan. The Chinese government denied that selling dollar-denominated assets would be an official policy in the foreseeable future.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in September 2007 that the euro could replace the U.S. dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. It is \"absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency.\"\n\nThe U.S. Dollar Index (Ticker: USDX) is the creation of the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT), renamed in September 2007 to ICE Futures US. It was established in 1973 for tracking the value of the USD against a basket of currencies, which, at that time, represented the largest trading partners of the United States. It began with 17 currencies from 17 nations, but the launch of the euro subsumed 12 of these into one, so the USDX tracks only six currencies today.\n\nThe Index is described by the ICE as \"a geometrically-averaged calculation of six currencies weighted against the U.S. dollar.\"  The baseline of 100.00 on the USDX was set at its launch in March 1973. This event marks the watershed between the wider margins arrangement of the Smithsonian regime and the period of generalized floating that led up to the Second Amendment of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund. Since 1973, the USDX has climbed as high as the 160s and drifted as low as the 70s.\n\nThe USDX has not been updated to reflect new trading realities in the global economy, where the bulk of trade has shifted strongly towards new partners like China and Mexico and oil-exporting countries while the United States has de-industrialized.\n\nOther nations besides the United States use the U.S. dollar as their official currency, a process known as official dollarization. For instance, Panama has been using the dollar alongside the Panamanian balboa as the legal tender since 1904 at a conversion rate of 1:1. Ecuador (2000), El Salvador (2001), and East Timor (2000) all adopted the currency independently. The former members of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which included Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands, chose not to issue their own currency after becoming independent, having all used the U.S. dollar since 1944. Two British dependencies also use the U.S. dollar: the British Virgin Islands (1959) and Turks and Caicos Islands (1973). The islands Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, now collectively known as the Caribbean Netherlands, adopted the dollar on January 1, 2011, as a result of the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.\n\nThe U.S. dollar is an official currency in Zimbabwe, along with the Euro, the Pound Sterling, the Pula, the Rand, and several other currencies.\n\nSome countries that have adopted the U.S. dollar issue their own coins: See Ecuadorian centavo coins, Panamanian Balboa and East Timor centavo coins.\n\nA series of Zimbabwean Bond Coins was put into circulation on 18 December 2014 in 1, 5, 10, and 25 cent denominations. A 50 cent Bond Coin was released in March 2015. These coins are pegged at the same rate as American coins.\n\nSome other countries link their currency to U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate. The local currencies of Bermuda and the Bahamas can be freely exchanged at a 1:1 ratio for USD. Argentina used a fixed 1:1 exchange rate between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar from 1991 until 2002. The currencies of Barbados and Belize are similarly convertible at an approximate 2:1 ratio. The Netherlands Antillean guilder (and its successor the Caribbean guilder) and the Aruban florin are pegged to the dollar at a fixed rate of 1:1.79. The East Caribbean dollar is pegged to the dollar at a fixed rate of 2.7:1, and is used by all of the countries and territories of the OECS other than the British Virgin Islands. In Lebanon, one dollar is equal to 1500 Lebanese pound, and is used interchangeably with local currency as de facto legal tender. The exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the United States dollar has also been linked since 1983 at HK$7.8/USD, and pataca of Macau, pegged to Hong Kong dollar at MOP1.03/HKD, indirectly linked to the U.S. dollar at roughly MOP8/USD. Several oil-producing Arab countries on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, peg their currencies to the dollar, since the dollar is the currency used in the international oil trade.\n\nThe People's Republic of China's renminbi was informally and controversially pegged to the dollar in the mid-1990s at ¥ 8.28/USD. Likewise, Malaysia pegged its ringgit at RM3.8/USD in September 1998, after the financial crisis. On July 21, 2005, both countries removed their pegs and adopted managed floats against a basket of currencies. Kuwait did likewise on May 20, 2007, and Syria did likewise in July 2007. However, after three years of slow appreciation, the Chinese yuan has been \"de facto\" re-pegged to the dollar since July 2008 at a value of ¥6.83/USD; although no official announcement had been made, the yuan has remained around that value within a narrow band since then, similar to the Hong Kong dollar.\n\nSeveral countries use a crawling peg model, wherein currency is devalued at a fixed rate relative to the dollar. For example, the Nicaraguan córdoba is devalued by 5% per annum.\n\nBelarus, on the other hand, pegged its currency, the Belarusian ruble, to a basket of foreign currencies (U.S. dollar, euro and Russian ruble) in 2009. In 2011 this led to a currency crisis when the government became unable to honor its promise to convert Belarusian rubles to foreign currencies at a fixed exchange rate. BYR exchange rates dropped by two thirds, all import prices rose and living standards fell.\n\nIn some countries, such as Costa Rica and Honduras, the U.S. dollar is commonly accepted, although not officially regarded as legal tender. In Mexico's northern border area and major tourist zones, it is accepted as if it were a second legal currency. Many Canadian merchants close to the border, as well as large stores in big cities and major tourist hotspots in Peru also accept U.S. dollars, though usually at a value that favours the merchant. In Cambodia, U.S. notes circulate freely and are preferred over the Cambodian riel for large purchases, with the riel used for change to break 1 USD. After the U.S. liberation of Afghanistan, U.S. dollars are accepted as if it were legal tender.\n\nNot long after the introduction of the euro (€; ISO 4217 code EUR) as a cash currency in 2002, and the Iraq War costs from 2003, the dollar began to depreciate steadily in value, as it did against other major currencies. From 2003 to 2005, this depreciation continued, reflecting a widening current account deficit. Although the current account deficit began to stabilize in 2006 and 2007, depreciation persisted. The fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008 prompted the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in September 2007, and again in March 2008, sending the euro to a record high of $1.6038, reached in July 2008.\n\nIn addition to the trade deficit, the U.S. dollar's decline was linked to a variety of other factors, including a major spike in oil prices. Economists such as Alan Greenspan suggested that another reason for the decline of the dollar was its decreasing role as a major reserve currency. Chinese officials signaled plans to diversify the nation's $1.9 trillion reserve in response to a falling U.S. currency which also set the dollar under pressure.\n\nHowever, a sharp turnaround began in late 2008 with the onset of the global financial crisis. As investors sought out safe-haven investments in U.S. treasuries and Japanese government bonds from the financial turmoil, the Japanese yen and United States dollar sharply rose against other currencies, including the euro. At the same time, however, many countries such as China, India and Russia announced their intentions to diversify their foreign reserve portfolios away from the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe European sovereign debt crisis that unfolded in 2010 sent the euro falling to a four-year low of $1.1877 on June 7, as investors considered the risk that certain Eurozone members may default on their government debt. The euro's decline in 2008-2010 had erased half of its 2000-2008 rally.\n\nThe issuance of U.S dollar-denominated bond issued by Chinese institutions doubled to $214 billion in 2017 as tighter domestic regulations and market conditions saw Chinese companies look offshore to conduct their fund-raising initiatives. This has far outpaced many of the other major foreign currency bonds issued in Asia in the last few years.\n\nThe anticipated continuation of a prudent monetary policy in China to curb financial risks and asset bubbles, along with the expectation of a stronger yuan will likely see Chinese companies to continue to issue U.S. dollar bonds.\n\nMajor issuers of U.S. dollar denominated bonds have included Tencent Holdings Limited, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited and Sinopec Group. In 2017, China’s Ministry of Finance revealed plans to sell US$2 billion worth of U.S. dollar sovereign bonds in Hong Kong, its first dollar bond offering since October 2004. The technology and communications sector in China is a taking significant share of the offshore U.S. dollar bond market. Tencent priced $5 billion of notes in January 2018 as a string of Asian technology firms continued to issue debt as market values swelled. \n\nU.S dollar-denominated bond issued by Chinese institutions has also been referred to as 'Kungfu bonds', a term coined by Bloomberg L.P., after a consultation with more than 400 market participants across Asia. \n\n"}

The third largest group in Europe is the Yenish, an indigenous Germanic group.\n\nThe origins of the indigenous itinerant groups are unclear. They have been assumed to have taken up the travelling lifestyle out of necessity at some point during the Early Modern period but to not be ethnically distinct from their source population. However, recent DNA testing has shown that the Irish Travellers are genetically distinct from their settled counterparts, and more groups are being studied.\n\nMany groups speak their own language or dialect (distinct from the settled population); it's often a blend of the local settled language and Romani language, even in non-Romani groups.\n\nAs opposed to nomads who travel with and subsist on herds of livestock, itinerant groups traditionally travel for trade or other work for the sedentary populations amongst which they live.\n\nIndigenous Travellers in the Netherlands (\"caravan dwellers\" or \"Woonwagenbewoner\") are first mentioned in the 1879 census, although boat dwellers who practised the same professions (chair bottomers, traders, peddlers, artisans, etc.) were common before then.\n\nA group who call themselves Reisende; i.e. indigenous Norwegian Travellers. Confusingly, this term is also used by the Tater people, the biggest population of Romani people in Norway and Sweden.\nUnlike the Tater people, the indigenous Norwegian Travellers are non-Roma by culture and origins, and they do not speak any form of Romani language.\n\nThe Pavee are ethnically Irish, but have a separate language and culture than the settled Irish. They live predominantly in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Travellers refer to themselves as Minceir or Pavees in their own language or in Irish as an Lucht Siúil, meaning literally \"the walking people\". The term Pikey is a pejorative slang term used mainly in the United Kingdom to refer to Irish Travellers. The language of the Irish Travellers, Shelta, is mainly based on an Irish Gaelic lexicon and an English grammar. There are two dialects of this language: Gammon (or Gamin) and Cant. It has been dated back to the eighteenth century but may be older. The vast majority of Irish Travellers are Roman Catholics who maintain their traditions and culture in a close knit community of families.\n\nIn 2011 an analysis of DNA from 40 Travellers showed that Irish Travellers are a distinct Irish ethnic minority who separated from the settled Irish community at least 1000 years ago; the claim was made that they are as distinct from the settled community as Icelanders are from Norwegians.\n\nLike other itinerant groups they have often been racially discriminated against in the past and still are today. They were only recognised as an official ethnic group in the Republic of Ireland on March 1, 2017.\n\nThe \"Quinqui\" or \"mercheros\" of Spain are a minority group, formerly nomadic, who share a similar way of life with the Spanish Roma. There are a few theories about their origin: they may be peasants who lost their land in the 16th century, descendants of Muslims who took to nomadism to avoid persecution, or marginalised people who have mixed with Roma. Most likely they are a mixture of all of the above. In spite of sharing persecution and mores with the Roma, the Quinqui have often set themselves apart from them.\n\nThe best known of these communities are the Romani people (also \"Romany\", \"Romanies\" \"Tzigani\", \"Rromani\", and variants).\nThe Romani are of Indo-Aryan origin and first entered Europe via the Middle East during the 14th century. They spread further through Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, separating into various subgroups in the process.\n\nThere are multiple Gypsy and Traveller groups in Scotland: the indigenous Scottish Highland Travellers also known as \"Ceardannan\" (Scottish Gaelic which means \"the craftsmen\" or 'Black Tinkers') or more poetically as the \"Summer Walkers\", Scottish Border Gypsies (who are a Romani group), and Lowland Scottish Gypsy/Travellers, whose origins are unclear. The English term 'Travelling People' has been adopted into contemporary Gaelic as \"luchd siubhail\" (people of travel) but this is a wider term covering other groups of itinerant communities within Scotland.\n\nThe Scottish Highland Travellers have their own now nearly extinct language based on Scottish Gaelic called Beurla Reagaird (or English Backwards). Highland Travellers are closely tied to their native Highlands the native Gaelic speaking population; they may follow a nomadic or a settled lifestyle. They have played an essential role in the preservation of traditional Gaelic culture. Travellers' outstanding contribution to Highland life has been as custodians of an ancient and vital Gaelic singing, storytelling and folklore tradition of great importance. It is estimated that only 2,000 Scottish Highland Travellers continue to lead their traditional lifestyle on the roads.\n\nIn German-speaking Europe, France and Wallonia,\nthere are the \"Jenische\" or \"Yeniche\" (in German and French spelling, respectively).\nAn early description of this group was published by Johann Ulrich Schöll in 1793.\n\nTravelling Showpeople/Show Travellers (known in France as Forains Industriel), Circus and Bargees are Occupational Travellers. These groups formed around particular crafts and professions that required frequent mobility and usually follow a set pattern of nomadism year after year. Membership of these groups have, over the years, been drawn from other communities (including, in the case of travelling funfairs and circuses, Romani people).\n\nAs a result, Occupational Travellers are not defined as an ethnic group, even though they display certain common features; they tend to be insular favouring intermarriage resulting in long lineages and a strong sense of cultural homogeneity (The Showman's Guild of Great Britain and Ireland requires that applicants for membership have a parent from the Show Traveller community).\n\nFurther examples include the use of Parlyaree/Polari among Fairground Travellers in the UK and the development of unique jargons, customs and traditions Linguistically, many Occupational Travellers in the fairground and circus worlds have cultural affinities with Romani groups, such as significant traces of the Romani language and matriarchial forms of social organisation.\n\n"}

{"id": "2660016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2660016", "title": "Japanese honorifics", "text": "Japanese honorifics\n\nThe Japanese language makes use of honorific suffixes when referring to others in a conversation. These suffixes are attached to the end of names, and are often gender-neutral. Honorific suffixes also indicate the level of the speaker and referred individual's relationship and are often used alongside other components of Japanese honorific speech, called .\n\nAlthough honorifics are not part of the basic grammar of the Japanese language, they are a fundamental part of the sociolinguistics of Japanese, and proper use is essential to proficient and appropriate speech. Referring to oneself using an honorific, or dropping an honorific when it is required, is a serious faux pas, in either case coming across as clumsy or arrogant.\n\nThey can be applied to either the first or last name depending on which is given. In situations where both the first and last names are spoken, the suffix is attached to whichever comes last in the word order.\n\nAn honorific is generally used when referring to the person one is talking to (one's \"interlocutor\"), or when referring to an unrelated third party in speech. It is dropped, however, by some superiors, when referring to one's in-group, or in formal writing, and is never used to refer to oneself, except for dramatic effect, or some exceptional cases.\n\nDropping the honorific suffix when referring to one's interlocutor, which is known as to , implies a high degree of intimacy and is generally reserved for one's spouse, younger family members, social inferiors (as in a teacher addressing students in traditional arts), and very close friends. Within sports teams or among classmates, where the interlocutors approximately have the same age or seniority, it can be acceptable to use family names without honorifics. Some people of the younger generation, roughly born since 1970, prefer to be referred to without an honorific. However, dropping honorifics is a sign of informality even with casual acquaintances.\n\nWhen referring to a third person, honorifics are used except when referring to one's family members while talking to a non-family member, or when referring to a member of one's company while talking to a customer or someone from another company—this is the uchi–soto (in-group/out group) distinction. Honorifics are not used to refer to oneself, except when trying to be arrogant (\"ore-sama\"), to be cute (\"-chan\"), or sometimes when talking to young children to teach them how to address the speaker.\n\nUse of honorifics is correlated with other forms of honorific speech in Japanese, such as use of the polite form (\"-masu, desu\") versus the plain form—using the plain form with a polite honorific (\"-san, -sama\") can be jarring, for instance.\n\nWhile these honorifics are solely used on proper nouns, these suffixes can turn common nouns into proper nouns when attached to the end of them. This can be seen on words such as which turns the common noun into a proper noun which would refer solely to that particular cat, while adding the honorific \"-chan\" can also mean cute\n\nWhen translating honorific suffixes into English, separate pronouns or adjectives must be used in order to convey \ncharacteristics to the person they are referencing as well. While some honorifics such as \"-san\" are very frequently used due to their gender neutrality and very simple definition of polite unfamiliarity, other honorifics such as \"-chan\" or \"-kun\" are more specific as to the context in which they must be used as well as the implications they give off when attached to a person's name. These implications can only be translated into English using either adjectives or adjective word phrases.\n\n (sometimes pronounced in Kansai dialect) is the most commonplace honorific and is a title of respect typically used between equals of any age. Although the closest analog in English are the honorifics \"Mr.\", \"Miss\", \"Ms.\", or \"Mrs.\", \"-san\" is almost universally added to a person's name; \"-san\" can be used in formal and informal contexts and for both genders. Because it is the most common honorific, it is also the most often used to convert common nouns into proper ones, as seen below.\n\n\"San\" may be used in combination with workplace nouns, so a bookseller might be addressed or referred to as and a butcher as .\n\n\"San\" is sometimes used with company names. For example, the offices or shop of a company called Kojima Denki might be referred to as \"Kojima Denki\"-san\"\" by another nearby company. This may be seen on small maps often used in phone books and business cards in Japan, where the names of surrounding companies are written using \"-san\".\n\n\"San\" can be attached to the names of animals or even inanimate objects. For example, a pet rabbit might be called , and fish used for cooking can be referred to as , but both would be considered childish (akin to \"Mr. Fish\" or \"Mr. Fishy\" in English) and would be avoided in formal speech. Married people often refer to their spouse with \"-san\".\n\nDue to \"-san\" being gender neutral and commonly used, it can be used to refer to people who are not close or whom one does not know. However, it may not be appropriate when using it on someone who is close or when it is clear that other honorifics should be used.\n\nOnline, Japanese gamers often append a numeral 3 to another player's name to denote \"-san\" (e.g., \"Taro3\" conveys \"Taro-san\"), since the number three is also pronounced \"san\".\n\n is a more respectful version for people of a higher rank than oneself or divine, toward one's guests or customers (such as a sports venue announcer addressing members of the audience), and sometimes toward people one greatly admires. It is seemingly said to be the origin word for \"-san\" but there is no major evidence otherwise. Deities such as native Shinto \"kami\" and the Christian God are referred to as , meaning \"Revered spirit\"-sama\"\". When used to refer to oneself, \"-sama\" expresses extreme arrogance (or self-effacing irony), as in praising one's self to be of a higher rank, as with .\n\n\"Sama\" customarily follows the addressee's name on postal packages and letters and in business email.\n\n\"Sama\" also appears in such set phrases as , , or .\n\nWith the exception of the Emperor of Japan, \"-sama\" can be used to informally address the Empress and other members of the Imperial Family. The Emperor is, however, always addressed as . (See \"Royal and official titles\" below).\n\nChan\n\nAlthough \"-kun\" is generally used for boys, it is not a hard rule. For example, \"-kun\" can be used to name a close personal friend or family member of any gender. In business settings, young female employees are addressed as \"-kun\" by older males of senior status. It can be used by male teachers addressing their female students.\n\n\"Kun\" can mean different things depending on the gender. \"Kun\" for females is a more respectful honorific than \"-chan\", which implies childlike cuteness. \"Kun\" is not only used to address females formally; it can also be used for a very close friend or family member. Calling a female \"-kun\" is not insulting, and can also mean that the person is respected, although that is not the normal implication. Rarely, sisters with the same name, such as \"Miku\", may be differentiated by calling one \"Miku\"-chan\"\" and the other \"Miku\"-san\" or \"-sama\", and on some occasions \"-kun\"\". \"Chan\" and \"-kun\" occasionally mean similar things. General use of \"-kun\" for females implies respectful endearment, and that the person being referred to is sweet and kind.\n\nIn the National Diet (Legislature), the Speaker of the House uses \"-kun\" when addressing Diet members and ministers. An exception was when Takako Doi was the Speaker of the lower house, where she used the title \"-san\".\n\n is a diminutive suffix; it expresses that the speaker finds a person endearing. It is seemingly said to have come from a \"cute\" pronouncing of \"-san\" (in Japanese, replacing \"s\" sounds with \"ch\" sounds is seen as cute), although there is no evidence otherwise as this suffix has been used since the early days of ancient Japan. In general, \"-chan\" is used for babies, young children, close friends, grandparents and sometimes female adolescents. It may also be used towards cute animals, lovers, close friends, or a youthful woman. Using \"-chan\" with a superior's name is considered to be condescending and rude.\n\nAlthough traditionally, honorifics are not applied to oneself, some people adopt the childlike affectation of referring to themselves in the third person using \"-chan\" (childlike because it suggests that one has not learned to distinguish between names used for oneself and names used by others). For example, a young woman named \"Kanako\" might call herself \"Kanako-chan\" rather than using a first person pronoun. \"Chan\" is only used between people who have known each other for a long time or who are of the same gender. Otherwise, using this for someone, especially adults, only known for a short period of time, can be seen as offensive.\n\n is an even more cute or affectionate variant of \"-chan\". It evokes a small child's mispronunciation of that form of address, or baby talk – similar to how, for example, a speaker of English might use \"widdle\" instead of \"little\" when speaking to a baby. Moe anthropomorphisms are often labeled as \"-tan\", e.g., the commercial mascot Habanero-tan, the manga figure Afghanis-tan or the OS-tans representing operating systems.\n\n is another diminutive that expresses endearment. Like \"-chan\", it is used for babies or young children, but is exclusively used for boys instead of girls.\n\n is used to address or refer to one's elder colleagues in a school, dojo, or sports club. So at school, the students in higher grades than oneself are \"senpai\". Teachers are not \"senpai\", but rather they are \"sensei\". Neither are students of the same or lower grade: they are referred to as \"kōhai\". In a business environment, those with more experience are \"senpai\".\n\n is used to refer to or address teachers, doctors, politicians, lawyers, and other authority figures. It is used to show respect to someone who has achieved a certain level of mastery in an art form or some other skill, such as accomplished novelists, musicians, artists and martial artists. In Japanese martial arts, \"sensei\" typically refers to someone who is the head of a dojo. As with \"senpai\", \"sensei\" can be used not only as a suffix, but also as a stand-alone title. The term is not generally used when addressing a person with very high academic expertise; the one used instead is .\n\n\"Sensei\" can be used fawningly, and it can also be employed sarcastically to ridicule such fawning. The Japanese media invoke it (rendered in katakana, akin to scare quotes or italics in English) to highlight the megalomania of those who allow themselves to be sycophantically addressed with the term.\n\n is used in formal writing, and sometimes in very formal speech, for referring to a person who is unfamiliar to the speaker, typically a person known through publications whom the speaker has never actually met. For example, the \"-shi\" title is common in the speech of newsreaders. It is preferred in legal documents, academic journals, and certain other formal written styles. Once a person's name has been used with \"-shi\", the person can be referred to with \"-shi\" alone, without the name, as long as there is only one person being referred to.\n\nIt is common to use a job title after someone's name, instead of using a general honorific. For example, an named Ichiro might be referred to as \"\"Ichiro-senshu\" rather than \"Ichiro-san\", and a named Suzuki might be referred to as \"Suzuki-tōryō\" rather than \"Suzuki-san\"\".\n\nIn a business setting, it is common to refer to people using their rank, especially for positions of authority, such as or . Within one's own company or when speaking of another company, title + \"san\" is used, so a president is \"Shachō-san\". When speaking of one's own company to a customer or another company, the title is used by itself or attached to a name, so a department chief named Suzuki is referred to as \"Buchō\" or Suzuki-\"buchō\".\n\nHowever, when referring to oneself, the title is used indirectly, as using it directly is perceived as arrogant. Thus, a department chief named Suzuki will introduce themselves as 部長の鈴木 \"Buchō\"-\"no\"-Suzuki, rather than ×鈴木部長 *Suzuki-\"buchō.\"\n\nConvicted and suspected criminals were once referred to without any title, but now an effort is made to distinguish between , , and , so as not to presume guilt before anything has been proven. These titles can be used by themselves or attached to names.\n\nHowever, although \"suspect\" and \"defendant\" began as neutral descriptions, they have become derogatory over time. When actor and musician Gorō Inagaki was arrested for a traffic accident in 2001, some media referred him with the newly made title , originating from the English word \"member\", to avoid use of . But in addition to being criticized as an unnatural term, this title also became derogatory almost instantly—an example of euphemism treadmill.\n\nThere are several different words for \"our company\" and \"your company\". \"Our company\" can be expressed with the humble or the neutral , and \"your company\" can be expressed with the honorific or . Additionally, the neutral can refer to either the speaker's or the listener's company. All of these titles are used by themselves, not attached to names.\n\nWhen mentioning a company's name, it is considered important to include its status depending on whether it is or . These are often abbreviated as 株 and 有 respectively.\n\n, pronounced when attached to a name, roughly means \"lord\" or \"master\". It does not equate noble status; rather it is a term akin to \"milord\" or French \"monseigneur\", and lies below \"-sama\" in level of respect. This title is not commonly used in daily conversation, but it is still used in some types of written business correspondence, as well as on certificates and awards, and in written correspondence in tea ceremonies. It is also used to indicate that the person referred to has the same (high) rank as the referrer, yet commands respect from the speaker.\n\n is another suffix coming from Japanese history. It was used to denominate Lords and Ladies in the Court, especially during the Heian period. The most famous example is the Prince Hikaru Genji, protagonist of \"The Tale of Genji\" who was called . Nowadays, this suffix can be used as a metaphor for someone who behaves like a prince or princess from ancient times, but its use is very rare. Its main usage remains in historical dramas.\n\nThis suffix also appears when addressing lovers in letters from a man to a woman, as in .\n\n literally means \"above\", and denotes a high level of respect. While its use is no longer common, it is still seen in constructions like , and , reverent terms for \"father\", \"mother\" and \"older sister\" respectively. Receipts that do not require specification of the payer's name are often filled in with \"ue-sama\".\n\n\nMartial artists often address their teachers as \"sensei\". Junior and senior students are organized via a \"senpai/kōhai\" system.\nAlso in some systems of karate, \"O-Sensei\" is the title of the (deceased) head of the style. This is how the founder of Aikido, Morihei Ueshiba is often referred to by practitioners of that art. The \"O-\" prefix itself, translating roughly as \"great[er]\" or \"major,\" is also an honorific.\n\nVarious titles are also employed to refer to senior instructors. Which titles are used depends on the particular licensing organization.\n\n are martial arts titles developed by the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, the Kokusai Budoin and the International Martial Arts Federation Europe. Many organizations in Japan award such titles upon a sincere study and dedication of Japanese martial arts. The below mentioned titles are awarded after observing a person's martial arts skills, his/her ability of teaching and understanding of martial arts and the most importantly as a role model and the perfection of one's character.\n\n\nLevels of black belts sometimes used as martial arts titles\n\n\n\nIn informal speech, some Japanese people may use contrived suffixes in place of normal honorifics. This is essentially a form of wordplay, with suffixes being chosen for their sound, or for friendly or scornful connotations. Although the range of such suffixes that might be coined is limitless, some have gained such widespread usage that the boundary between established honorifics and wordplay has become a little blurred. Examples of such suffixes include variations on \"-chan\" (see below), \"-bee\" (scornful), and \"-rin\" (friendly).\nNote that unlike a proper honorific, use of such suffixes is governed largely by how they sound in conjunction with a particular name, and on the effect the speaker is trying to achieve.\n\nSome honorifics have baby talk versions—mispronunciations stereotypically associated with small children and cuteness, and more frequently used in popular entertainment than in everyday speech. The baby talk version of \"-sama\" is .\n\nThere are even baby talk versions of baby talk versions. \"Chan\" can be changed to , and less often, to .\n\nWords for family members have two different forms in Japanese. When referring to one's own family members while speaking to a non-family-member, neutral, descriptive nouns are used, such as for \"mother\" and for \"older brother\". When addressing one's own family members or addressing or referring to someone else's family members, honorific forms are used. Using the suffix \"-san\", as is most common, \"mother\" becomes and \"older brother\" becomes . The honorifics \"-chan\" and \"-sama\" may also be used instead of \"-san\", to express a higher level of closeness or reverence, respectively.\n\nThe general rule is that a younger family member (e.g., a young brother) addresses an older family member (e.g., a big brother) using an honorific form, while the older family member calls the younger one only by name.\n\nThe honorific forms are:\n\nThe initial in these nouns is itself an honorific prefix. In more casual situations the speaker may omit this prefix but will keep the suffix.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The museum originated in 1911 as the Municipal Museum of History and Art (\"Museo Civico di Storia e d'Arte\"). At its centenary in 2011, the museum opened a new permanent exhibition \"Between the Serenissima, Napoleon and the Habsburgs\" and enriched its collection.\n\nThe first initiatives to establish a museum in Koper-Capodistria took place as early as the late 18th century, but the main push for its foundation was provided by the first exhibition of the Istrian Region in Koper (Prima Esposizione Provinciale Istriana) in 1910. One year later the then Municipality of Koper-Capodistria established the Municipal Museum of History and Art (Museo Civico di Storia e d'Arte), and after the First World War the spacious early 17th century Belgramoni Tacco Palace building was set aside for use as a museum.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the permanent collection was seriously impaired when many precious works of art were evacuated to Friuli (Villa Manin in Passariano). When 'Zone B' was incorporated into Slovenia in 1954, the museum was renamed the District Museum, and in 1967 its name was changed to Koper Regional Museum (Museo Regionale di Capodistria). From 1981–1985, the museum's central building was completely renovated and this made it possible to expand the museum's activities and to rearrange its collections.\n\nThe museum has a wide scope of coverage, mainly concerning Primorska region: archaeology, history, art and cultural history, ethnology and cultural heritage of coastal and karst areas. Important attention is being paid to participation in cultural, scientific and educational establishments and associations, with particular emphasis on cooperation with Slovenian institutions abroad and Italian and Croatian institutions in Istria and Dalmatia.\n\nToday, the parent museum building presents an archaeological collection and collections covering the history of culture, art and history of Istria from its very beginning to the end of the 19th century. The conservation restoration workshop preserves the museum material and organizes the technical days and workshops at the temporary exhibitions in the context of educational activities.\n\nThe museum manages three satellites; in 1983 the Ethnological Collection of Koper Regional Museum was established as an independent branch, and in 1990 the museum also assumed responsibility for the Tartini Memorial Room, housed in the Piran birthplace of composer and violinist Giuseppe Tartini. The third satellite collection was opened in Prem Castle in 2008, presenting castles and building sites in the Reka river basin.\n\nThe recent permanent exhibition \"Between the Serenissima, Napoleon and the Habsburgs\" covers the period from 16h to 19th century and presents some of the most prominent residents such as the bishops Paolo Naldini and Pier Paolo Vergerio jr. (1498–1565), Santorio Santorio (1561–1636), a doctor and researcher who invented the thermometer, and the writer and historian Giovanni Rinaldo (1720–1795). The display includes the weapon collection, presented for the first time. \n\nBoth the lapidary collection and the open air collection in the palace garden present the oldest material culture of the coastal and karst areas. The culture and art history collection consists of sculptures, paintings and arts and crafts products, arranged in chronological order and by theme, from early medieval sculptures with guilloche ornamentation (9th–11th centuries) to a fresco copy of \"The Dance of Death\" from Hrastovlje and inscriptions in the Glagolitic alphabet. \n\nPinakoteka presents paintings, sculptures and products of the arts and crafts, complemented by 17th- and 18th-century furnishings from the Venetian cultural area, while historical material from the 18th and 19th centuries presents some eminent figures from the fields of medicine, pharmacy, the Enlightenment and political life in the Koper area. \n\nIn the pavilion along the Museum's lapidary, a collection of the recent history of the Southern Primorska region is presented, the fight for survival in Brkini, Slovenska Bistrica and Istra, portrayed also on \"Rapallo\" painting by Tone Kralj, while at Gramsci Square an ethnological collection is on permanent display.\n\nThe museum presents several own and travelling exhibitions through the year. In 1995–1998 an exhibition of recent history was assembled in the pavilion adjacent to the museum's lapidary collection, presenting the national and political struggle of the Istrian Slovenes and people from Primorje (the coast land) at the turn of the 20th century. This exhibition covers the periods from the national awakening of the Istrian Slovenes before the First World War up to the incorporation of Zone B of the Free Territory of Trieste and the diplomatic struggle for the incorporation of the area into the Slovene homeland (London Memorandum 1954).\n\nIn February 2010 a joint exhibition of Koper Museum and several other Slovenian museums, together with a Town Museum Trieste \"With a Fibula into Fable\" is being planned. The exhibition presents brooches which were found in Western Slovenian area, adjacent to the Friuli region. It follows the development of fibulae in that area from prehistoric to Roman times and the early Middle Ages.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18465762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18465762", "title": "Legal case management", "text": "Legal case management\n\nThe terms legal case management (LCM) or matter management refer to a subset of law practice management and cover a range of approaches and technologies used by law firms and courts to leverage knowledge and methodologies for managing the life cycle of a case or matter more effectively. Generally, the terms refer to the sophisticated information management and workflow practices that are tailored to meet the legal field's specific needs and requirements.\n\nAs attorneys and law firms compete for clients they are routinely challenged to deliver services at lower costs with greater efficiency, thus firms develop practice-specific processes and utilize contemporary technologies to assist in meeting such challenges. Law practice management processes and technologies include case and matter management, time and billing, litigation support, research, communication and collaboration, data mining and modeling, and data security, storage, and archive accessibility.\n\nLegal case or matter management software has two primary functions: it helps to better use, manage, consolidate, share, and protect information, and it tracks and shapes the business process. Because the most useful forms of such software can integrate data from multiple systems, departments, users, and business entities, its use can increase a firm's business advantage.\n\nCase or matter management systems having the capacity to push and pull data over the Internet, whether within the software itself or within an integrated software framework or environment became an industry standard with the advent of the Lexis and Westlaw legal research platforms.\n\nCase management software is marketed to specific segments of the legal marketplace, with some products designed for small firms and others for large multinational firms, and a few claim to be scalable to all. Cost-containment and competition concerns facing small-to-mid-size firms that cannot afford a full-time IT staff often drive custom solutions incorporating muliple integrated products.\n\nIn-house legal teams (in the public and private sectors) have their own needs: generally these require less emphasis on billing and accounts (since clients tend to be internal), and even more on traceability, real-time integration and configurability. The need to improve productivity of the team and reduce costs to taxpayers, or the business, is often a key driver. Some in-house teams have reduced their external legal bills by using case management software to increase their capacity and bring case work in-house.\n\nAs electronic court systems continue to increase their online presence, many now require case filings to be accomplished electronically. Many legal software vendors' products include the ability to take advantage of such electronic filing by pulling data from the case management product and pushing it into court filing systems.\n\nIn litigation, the discovery process often results in enormous amounts of information that must be managed, and with the revision of the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 2006 to include electronic means of discovery came a new subset of case management systems that incorporated those changes, often dubbed 'electronic evidence' or 'e-discovery' management systems. Since the new rules took effect, e-Discovery firms as outside service vendors have flourished.\n\nThe term case management is also used to refer to systems in which court or tribunal officials assume closer administrative control over the litigation process than is traditionally associated with common law litigation. The Assisted Dispute Resolution program was introduced into the Federal Court in 1990 after a number of cases failed to reach resolutions having several directional hearings. In those cases the parties were not able to isolate the issues requiring determination. With the new program, judges can refer the parties to a court registrar for mediation. This is stated in the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 Section 53A(1):\n\nCase management in the State of New South Wales includes governing civil court proceedings by court management rules, which are the \"Civil Procedure Act 2005\" (NSW) and \"Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005\" (NSW). The overriding purpose of case management in the \"Civil Procedure Act 2005\" is 'to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution' to the matter at dispute in the civil court proceedings (s56(1), \"Civil Procedure Act 2005\" (NSW) ).\n\nIn Australia, mediation as an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) method is designed to avoid resorting to formal court-based adjudication and is now also being applied to criminal matters. Traditional theories of criminal justice view the matter as one between the offender and the state.\n\nIt is not necessary to have the parties consent to the mediation process and a judge can direct the mediation. In this sense, case management is designed to identify and define issues in dispute and to reduce delays, costs and unnecessary pre-trial activities. \n\n[W]hat was born of resistance and opposition to the formal justice system has been extensively integrated and co-opted into the system.\n\n"}

After the 1917 Russian Revolution, Gimbutas's parents founded the first Lithuanian hospital in the capital.\n\nDuring this period, her father also served as the publisher of the newspaper \"Vilniaus Žodis\" and the cultural magazine \"Vilniaus Šviesa\" and was an outspoken proponent of Lithuanian independence during the Polish–Lithuanian War.\n\nGimbutas's parents were connoisseurs of traditional Lithuanian folk arts and frequently invited contemporary musicians, writers, and authors to their home, including Vydūnas, Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas, and Jonas Basanavičius. With regard to her strong cultural upbringing, Gimbutas said:I had the opportunity to get acquainted with writers and artists such as Vydūnas, Tumas-Vaižgantas, even Basanavičius, who was taken care of by my parents. When I was four or five years old, I would sit in Basanavičius's easy chair and I would feel fine. And later, throughout my entire life, Basanavičius's collected folklore remained extraordinarily important for me.\n\nIn 1931, Gimbutas settled with her parents in Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania, where she continued her studies. After her parents separated that year, she lived with her mother and brother, Vytautas, in Kaunas. Five years later, her father died suddenly. At her father's deathbed, Gimbutas pledged that she would study to become a scholar: \"All of a sudden I had to think what I shall be, what I shall do with my life. I had been so reckless in sports—swimming for miles, skating, bicycle riding. I changed completely and began to read.\"\n\nIn 1941, she married architect Jurgis Gimbutas. During the Second World War, Gimbutas lived under both Soviet and German occupations from 1940–41 and 1941–43, respectively.\n\nTheir first daughter, Danutė, was born in June 1942; early in 1944 the young Gimbutas family fled the country in the face of an advancing Soviet army, first to Vienna and then to Innsbruck and Bavaria. In her reflection of this turbulent period, Gimbutas remarked, \"Life just twisted me like a little plant, but my work was continuous in one direction.\"\n\nWhile holding a postdoctoral fellowship at Tübingen the following year, Gimbutas gave birth to her second daughter, Živilė. She did postgraduate work at the University of Heidelberg and the University of Munich from 1947 to 1949. The Gimbutas family left Germany and relocated to the United States in 1949.\n\nHer third daughter, Rasa Julija, was born in August 1954 in Boston.\n\nShe died in Los Angeles in 1994, at age 73. Soon afterwards, she was interred in Kaunas's Petrašiūnai Cemetery.\n\nFrom 1936, she participated in ethnographic expeditions to record traditional folklore and studied Lithuanian beliefs and rituals of death. She graduated with honors from Aušra Gymnasium in Kaunas in 1938 and enrolled in the Vytautas Magnus University the same year, where she studied linguistics in the Department of Philology. She then attended the University of Vilnius to pursue graduate studies in archaeology (under Jonas Puzinas), linguistics, ethnology, folklore and literature.\n\nIn 1942 she completed her master's thesis, \"Modes of Burial in Lithuania in the Iron Age\", with honors. She received her Master of Arts degree from the University of Vilnius, Lithuania, in 1942.\n\nIn 1946, Gimbutas received a doctorate in archaeology, with minors in ethnology and history of religion, from Tübingen University with her dissertation \"Prehistoric Burial Rites in Lithuania\" (in German), which was published later that year.\n\nAfter arriving in the United States, Gimbutas immediately went to work at Harvard University translating Eastern European archaeological texts. She then became a lecturer in the Department of Anthropology. In 1955 she was made a Fellow of Harvard's Peabody Museum.\n\nGimbutas was Professor Emeritus at UCLA, where she became Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies in 1964 and Curator of Old World Archaeology in 1965.\n\nThe Marija Gimbutas papers are held at OPUS Archives and Gimbutas's personal library is held in The Joseph Campbell and Marija Gimbutas Library.\n\nIn 1956 Gimbutas introduced her \"Kurgan hypothesis\", which combined archaeological study of the distinctive \"Kurgan\" burial mounds with linguistics to unravel some problems in the study of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) speaking peoples, whom she dubbed the \"Kurgans\"; namely, to account for their origin and to trace their migrations into Europe. This hypothesis, and the act of bridging the disciplines, has had a significant impact on Indo-European studies.\n\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s, Gimbutas earned a reputation as a world-class specialist on Bronze Age Europe, as well as on Lithuanian folk art and the prehistory of the Balts and Slavs, partly summed up in her definitive opus, \"Bronze Age Cultures of Central and Eastern Europe\" (1965). In her work she reinterpreted European prehistory in light of her backgrounds in linguistics, ethnology, and the history of religions, and challenged many traditional assumptions about the beginnings of European civilization.\n\nAs a Professor of European Archaeology and Indo-European Studies at UCLA from 1963 to 1989, Gimbutas directed major excavations of Neolithic sites in southeastern Europe between 1967 and 1980, including Anzabegovo, near Štip, Republic of Macedonia, and Sitagroi and Achilleion in Thessaly (Greece). Digging through layers of earth representing a period of time before contemporary estimates for Neolithic habitation in Europe – where other archaeologists would not have expected further finds – she unearthed a great number of artifacts of daily life and of religious cults, which she researched and documented throughout her career. During her successful career, Gimbutas stated, \"After a millennium when the Hun Empire collapsed, a distinct Slavic culture re-emerged and spread rapidly,\" and \"Neither Bulgars nor Avars colonized the Balkan Peninsula, after storming Thrace, Illyria and Greece they went back to their territory north of the Danube. It was the Slavs who did the colonizing.\"\n\nThree genetic studies in 2015 gave support to the Kurgan theory of Gimbutas regarding the Indo-European Urheimat. According to those studies, haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia) would have expanded from the Russian steppes, along with the Indo European languages; they also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo European Languages.\n\nGimbutas gained fame and notoriety in the English-speaking world with her last three English-language books: \"The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe\" (1974); \"The Language of the Goddess\" (1989), which inspired an exhibition in Wiesbaden, 1993–94; and the last of the three, \"The Civilization of the Goddess\" (1991), which, based on her documented archaeological findings, presented an overview of her conclusions about Neolithic cultures across Europe: housing patterns, social structure, art, religion, and the nature of literacy.\n\n\"The Civilization of the Goddess\" articulated what Gimbutas saw as the differences between the Old European system, which she considered goddess- and woman-centered (gynocentric), and the Bronze Age Indo-European patriarchal (\"androcratic\") culture which supplanted it. According to her interpretations, gynocentric (or \"matristic\") societies were peaceful, honored women, and espoused economic equality.\n\nThe androcratic, or male-dominated, Kurgan peoples, on the other hand, invaded Europe and imposed upon its natives the hierarchical rule of male warriors.\n\nGimbutas's work, along with that of her colleague, mythologist Joseph Campbell, is housed in the OPUS Archives and Research Center on the campus of the Pacifica Graduate Institute in Carpinteria, California. The library includes Gimbutas's extensive collection on the topics of archaeology, mythology, folklore, art and linguistics. The Gimbutas Archives house over 12,000 images personally taken by Gimbutas of sacred figures, as well as research files on Neolithic cultures of Old Europe.\n\nIn 1946, Marija Gimbutas received her PhD in Archeology & Applied Sciences from the University of Tübingen, Germany. Her doctoral dissertation was titled, \"Die Bestattung in Litauen in der vorgeschichtlichen Zeit\" (\"Burials in Lithuania in Prehistoric Times\") and was published by J.C.B. Mohr, Germany. She often said that she had the dissertation under one arm and her child under the other arm when she and her husband fled the city of Kaunas, Lithuania in the face of an advancing Soviet army in 1944.\n\nIn 1993, Marija Gimbutas received an honorary doctorate at Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania.\n\nGimbutas's theories have been extended and embraced by a number of neopaganism authors. Gimbutas did identify the diverse and complex Paleolithic and Neolithic female representations she recognized as depicting a single universal Great Goddess, but also as manifesting a range of female deities: snake goddess, bee goddess, bird goddess, mountain goddess, Mistress of the Animals, etc., which were not necessarily ubiquitous throughout Europe.\n\nIn a tape entitled \"The Age of the Great Goddess,\" Gimbutas discusses the various manifestations of the Goddess which occur, and stresses the ultimate unity behind them: all of the Earth as feminine.\n\nIn 2003, filmmaker Donna Read and neopagan author and activist Starhawk released a collaborative documentary film about the life and work of Gimbutas, \"Signs Out of Time\". The film produced under the label Belili Productions examines \"her theories, her critics, and her influence on scholars, feminists and social thinkers.\"\n\nJoseph Campbell and Ashley Montagu each compared the importance of Marija Gimbutas's output to the historical importance of the Rosetta Stone in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. Campbell provided a foreword to a new edition of Gimbutas's \"The Language of the Goddess\" (1989) before he died, and often said how profoundly he regretted that her research on the Neolithic cultures of Europe had not been available when he was writing \"The Masks of God\". The ecofeminist Charlene Spretnak argued in 2011 that a \"backlash\" against Gimbutas's work had been orchestrated, starting in the last years of her life and following her death.\n\nMainstream archaeology dismissed Gimbutas's later works. Anthropologist Bernard Wailes (1934–2012) of the University of Pennsylvania commented to \"The New York Times\" that most of Gimbutas's peers believe her to be \"immensely knowledgeable but not very good in critical analysis. ... She amasses all the data and then leaps from it to conclusions without any intervening argument.\" He said that most archaeologists consider her to be an eccentric.\n\nDavid W. Anthony has praised Gimbutas's insights regarding the Indo-European Urheimat, but also disputed Gimbutas's assertion that there was a widespread peaceful society before the Kurgan incursion, noting that Europe had hillforts and weapons, and presumably warfare, long before the Kurgan. A standard textbook of European prehistory corroborates this point, stating that warfare existed in neolithic Europe and that adult males were given preferential treatment in burial rites.\n\nPeter Ucko and Andrew Fleming were two early critics of the \"Goddess\" theory, with which later Gimbutas came to be associated. Ucko, in his 1968 monograph \"Anthropomorphic figurines of predynastic Egypt\" warned against unwarranted inferences about the meanings of statues. He notes, for example, that early Egyptian figurines of women holding their breasts had been taken as \"obviously\" significant of maternity or fertility, but the Pyramid Texts revealed that in Egypt this was the female gesture of grief.\n\nFleming, in his 1969 paper \"The Myth of the Mother Goddess\", questioned the practice of identifying neolithic figures as female when they weren't clearly distinguished as male and took issue with other aspects of the \"Goddess\" interpretation of Neolithic stone carvings and burial practices.\n\nThe 2009 book \"Knossos and the Prophets of Modernism\" by Cathy Gere examines the political influence on archaeology more generally. Through the example of Knossos on the island of Crete, which had been represented as the paradigm of a pacifist, matriarchal and sexually free society, Gere claims that archaeology can easily slip into reflecting what people want to see, rather than teaching people about an unfamiliar past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Social issues include homelessness; cyberbullying; physical, verbal and sexual abuse; suicide; drug addiction; street violence; immigration surveillance; engagement in high-risk sexual activity; self-harm, and depression. The rights of LGBTQ youth of colour are reportedly not addressed in discussions of sexuality and race in the larger context of LGBTQ rights.\n\nSpecific issues primarily stem from the framework of intersectionality. LGBTQ youth of colour may experience sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, heterosexism, white supremacy or poverty, sometimes simultaneously. Concerns for marginalized individuals in an already-marginalized community include intercultural competence, the school-to-prison pipeline, and school expulsions.\n\nActivities aimed at providing safe spaces and support for LGBTQ youth of colour activities are generally held in libraries, schools, non-profit agencies and designated community spaces. These activities, which provide practical sex education, mental-health support, empowerment and positive role models, usually require state funding as HIV/AIDS prevention.\n\nTheater, drag shows and street theater have been used as resources for queer communities in response to LGBTQ rights, such as during the AIDS crisis in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s. LGBTQ youth of colour have been using performances to tell their stories, in addition to social media, video production, blogging, and podcasting.\n\nThere has been an increase in media initiatives to include youth who identify as members of the LGBTQ community. Many platforms have channels which can be considered safe or welcoming for LGBTQ youth of colour.\n\nThe hashtag #morecolormorepride celebrates the addition of brown and black stripes, changing the rainbow flag designed by Gilbert Baler. The stripes were added to make the LGBTQ community more inclusive and advocate against racial discrimination.\nThe hashtag #VisibleMe was created to highlight stories from LGBT youth worldwide. The hashtag was used by a diverse community on a number of platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Many young teens shared their stories and created an Instagram channel. Movements such as the #40toNoneDay raised awareness regarding youth-of-color homelessness, particularly in the LGBT community. Sara Ramirez, who plays a bisexual doctor on \"Grey’s Anatomy\", advocates the movement to bring attention to the 40 percent of homeless youth who identify as part of the LGBT community; LGBT youth are less than seven percent of the general youth population.\n\nRepresentations of, and expressions by, LGBTQ youth of colour can be found in blog posts. Author and transgender activist Janet Mock began blogging in 2010, and writes about gender, race and representation. Mock was named as one of \"Time\" magazine’s 30 most influential people on the Internet. Her blog has a number of posts relevant to teens, ranging from bullying to the phenomenon known as Black Girl Magic.\n\nBlack Girl Dangerous, a social-justice blog written from a QTPoC perspective, was begun by Mia McKenzie in 2011. The blog has featured over 300 queer and transgender writers who have contributed their voices to topics like the queer male gaming experience. With over seven million readers, Black Girl Dangerous ended its online publication on July 31, 2017.\n\nThe social-networking site Tumblr has a number of blogs geared towards LGBT youth of colour, including Fuck Yeah Queer People of Color and LGBT + PoC. The blogs provide a space for LGBT youth of colour to contact other LGBT PoC youth.\n\nWith the rise in popularity of podcasts, the LGBTQ-of-colour community has connected with one another and discussed the triumphs and issues they face. In Louisville, Kentucky, Kaila Story and Jaison Gardner (two black members of the LGBTQ community) discuss a variety of topics weekly on their \"Strange Fruit\" podcast. Some, such as “politics, pop culture, and black gay life\", appeal to many youth. Nia King produces the podcast \"We Want the Airwaves\", which focuses on queer and transgender people of colour (particularly artists). In an interview, King focused on fighting oppression of this marginalized group and raising awareness of queer and transgender artists of colour.\nThe Trans Youth Equality Foundation funds a podcast, \"TransWaves\", which emphasizes education, advocacy and support for transgender youth and their families. Focusing on popularizing the trans-child movement, the podcast has interviews and anonymous advice for listeners.\n\nAdvocates for Youth, an online activism and resource portal for all youth, emphasizes initiatives for LGBTQ youth. One of its segments is Youth Resource, a website \"created by and for gay, lesbian, transgender, and questioning young people\" which encourages online peer educators to create an inclusive space. One of the most successful features of Youth Resource has been MyStoryOutLoud, a digital storytelling campaign for LGBTQ youth of colour to use technology to allow their voices to be heard and raise awareness of the need for safe spaces in communities. Using platforms such as Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram, LGBTQ+ People of Color can highlight their experiences in video or written narratives or other forms of art (including poetry and pictures). Another resource, Amplify (sponsored by Advocates for Youth) is an \"online youth activism hub.\" Advocates for Youth also has a cultural advocacy and mobilization initiative to empower youth through leadership training and encourage them to educate the community about safe spaces.\n\nStudies of racism, hetero- and homonormativity and positive role models for queer youth in media indicate that the lack of LGBTQ people of colour in media can affect LGBTQ youth of colour in coming out and their psychological development. \n\nAccording to the northwestern journal of law and social policy homelessness has risen over the years in the U.S., and homelessness has been addressed providing services and programs to help homelessness youth, however, these improvements regarding homelessness have not considered the differences among this population, the LGBTQ youth of color. According to Alone Without a Home, which reviewed state by state laws affecting unaccompanied youth, one of the biggest reasons for LGBTQ youth of color homelessness is that when the person decides to open up and say how they feel, their families turn against them and do not accept them; because of this, 20% of the youth have ended up leaving their houses. \n\nHomeless LGBTQ youth of colour rely on media (such as cellphones) for jobs, Internet access, resisting police harassment and documenting police misconduct.\n\nActress Laverne Cox, a black trans woman, has supported trans-youth rights on- and offscreen. With a spot on \"Time\" 100 Most Influential People List and an icon of LGBT History Month, she has used her fame and success to influence policy and increase acceptance. In speaking engagements and a documentary, Cox has created a dialogue for youth of colour and provided support and resources to her young transgender followers. In the midst of building her success, Laverne Cox was the first transgender woman to ever be on the cover of TIME Magazine.  Then, most recently on July 10, 2014 she made history once more in the entertainment world when she became the first transgender actress to receive an Emmy nomination. \n\nRuPaul became known for his drag-queen performances, his 1993 single \"Supermodel\" and the reality-TV \"RuPaul's Drag Race\". On the show other drag queens lip-sync to remain in the competition, and it examines the issues of masculinity, male femininity, living with HIV, recovering from addiction, the transgender community and the fight for marriage equality.\n\nHip hop singer and songwriter Frank Ocean released his debut studio album, \"Channel Orange\", in 2012. Days before the album's release, Ocean used Tumblr to post an open letter reminiscing about his feelings for another young man. \n\n\"Channel Orange\" received critical praise and six Grammy Award nominations. Def Jam Records co-founder Russell Simmons and other music-industry figures voiced support for Ocean. As one of the first openly-gay hip hop artists, he is credited with breaking barriers in hip hop and R&B (which have had a history of homophobia).\n\nInspired by New York's underground drag ballroom culture, Kiki is a subculture of the ballroom scene (which is spearheaded by LGBT youth of colour). Less formal than the ballroom scene, it provides a space for LGBT youth of colour to express themselves through performance and allows them to meet other LGBT youth. Kiki culture differs from ballroom culture in its focus on political and social activism, bringing attention to LGBT issues such as homelessness and HIV. It was brought to mainstream media through the documentary, \"Kiki\", written by Sara Jordenö and Twiggy Pucci. The band Scissor Sisters have also helped bring Kiki culture into the mainstream with their song, “Let’s Have a Kiki” which was released in September 2012 and was covered on the Fox television show \"Glee\".\n\nLaverne Cox’s Emmy-winning documentary, \"The T Word\", focuses on the transgender community. The documentary examines the lives of seven teens and young adults who identify as transgender, sharing their experiences and daily struggles and focusing on campus bullying, attempts to change gender pronouns, family issues, relationships and sex. A second documentary examines the problem of youth homelessness in the LGBT community. About 500,000 youth experience homelessness, and 200,000 identify as part of the LGBT community; over 70 percent of homeless LGBT youth are people of colour. The documentary follows Beniah, Noel, Giovanno, Benjamin, Danielle and Zaykeem over and 18-month period; Noel and Danielle are women.\n\nNetflix’s \"Orange Is the New Black\" includes a number of characters who identify as LGBT or question their sexuality in the penitentiary. Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley) is a black lesbian who was open about her sexuality before her incarceration. During the series, she develops a relationship with Brook Soso (Kimiko Glenn). Although Brook dated men before entering prison, she pursues a relationship with her fellow inmate. Sophia Burset (Laverne Cox) is a trans woman who is harassed and struggles to obtain her necessary hormones.\n\nABC Family’s \"Pretty Little Liars\" has a main character—Emily Fields (the multiracial Shay Mitchell)—who is in a relationship with a black lesbian, Maya St. Germain (Bianca Lawson). Emily later becomes engaged to Alison DiLaurentis in the series.\n\nThe Netflix series \"13 Reasons Why\" includes the gay Hispanic Tony Padilla (Christian Navarro), a main character and distributor of the tapes. Tony comes out to Clay (the main character) near the end of the season, mentioning a lack of acceptance by his Catholic family, and dates Brad (another character).\n\nUnique Unique Adams (Alex Newell) is a young black trans woman on Fox’s musical comedy-drama television series, \"Glee\", which aired from 2009 to 2015. \"Glee\" touched on the school’s bathroom policy, shedding light on a transgender issue, and Unique offers pivotal support of Coach Beiste after his sex reassignment surgery.\n\n"}

It attempts to preserve a public and private image of such a party to the contract. In essence one party to the contract is purchasing the other party's good name or reputation. These clauses are most seen in contracts between actors and actresses and their studios, athletes and their organization or proprietors of a product that the athlete(s) may endorse or as a part of a marital settlement. Commonly proscribed activity include the use or abuse of alcohol, the use of illegal drugs or narcotics or illegal or illicit sexual activity.\n\nThe impetus for a morals clause in contracts for 'talent,' i.e., artistic performers appears to have been a reaction to the Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle case in 1921. Subsequent to media outcry, Universal Studios decided to add a morals clause to contracts. The text of the 1921 Universal Studios clause read as follows: \"The actor (actress) agrees to conduct himself (herself) with due regard to public conventions and morals and agrees that he (she) will not do or commit anything tending to degrade him (her) in society or bring him (her) into public hatred, contempt, scorn or ridicule, or tending to shock, insult or offend the community or outrage public morals or decency, or tending to the prejudice of the Universal Film Manufacturing Company or the motion picture industry. In the event that the actor (actress) violates any term or provision of this paragraph, then the Universal Film Manufacturing Company has the right to cancel and annul this contract by giving five (5) days' notice to the actor (actress) of its intention to do so.\"\n\nThe first morals clause for a professional athlete may be a November 11, 1922 contract addendum for Babe Ruth. The clause stated: \n\nApparently, Colonel Jake Ruppert (owner of the Yankees) had also hoped to curtail the Babe's notorious womanizing. Ruth is quoted as replying, \"I'll promise to go easier on drinking and to get to bed earlier, but not for you, fifty thousand dollars, or two-hundred and fifty thousand dollars will I give up women. They're too much fun.\"\n\n morals clauses still exist widely for athletes, and in fact, may be invoked more quickly than in the past, as in the case of Ryan Lochte.\n\n"}
{"id": "6124876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6124876", "title": "Nagarjunakonda", "text": "Nagarjunakonda\n\nNagarjunakonda (IAST: Nāgārjunikoṇḍa, meaning Nagarjuna Hill) is a historical town, now an island located near Nagarjuna Sagar in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is 160 km west of another important historic site Amaravati Stupa.\n\nThe ruins of several Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu shrines are located at Nagarjunakonda. It is one of India's richest Buddhist sites, and now lies almost entirely under the Nagarjunasagar Dam. It is named after Nagarjuna, a southern Indian master of Mahayana Buddhism who lived in the 2nd century, who is believed to have been responsible for the Buddhist activity in the area. The site was once the location of many Buddhist universities and monasteries, attracting students from as far as China, Gandhara, Bengal and Sri Lanka.\n\nBecause of the construction of the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam, the archaeological relics at Nagarjunakonda were submerged, and had to be excavated and transferred to higher land on the hill, which has become an island.\n\nThe modern name of the site originates from its presumptive association with the Buddhist scholar Nagarjuna (\"konda\" is the Telugu word for \"hill\"). However, the archaeological finds at the site do not prove that it was associated with Nagarjuna. The 3rd-4th century inscriptions discovered here make it clear that it was known as \"Vijayapuri\" in the ancient period: the name \"Nagarjunakonda\" dates from the medieval period. The Ikshavaku inscriptions invariably associate their capital Vijayapuri with the Sriparvata hill, mentioning it as \"Siriparvate Vijayapure\".\n\nCoins issued by the later Satavahana kings (including Gautamiputra Satakarni, Pulumavi, and Yajna Satakarni) have been discovered at Nagarjunakonda. An inscription of Gautamiputra Vijaya Satakarni, dated to his 6th regnal year, has also been discovered at the site, and proves that Buddhism had spread in the region by this time.\n\nThe site rose to prominence after the decline of the Satavahanas, in the first quarter of the 3rd century, when the Ikshvaku king Vashishthiputra Chamamula established his capital Vijayapuri here. The coins and inscriptions discovered at Nagarjunakonda name four kings of the Ikshavaku dynasty: Vashishthi-putra Chamtamula, Mathari-putra Vira-purusha-datta, Vashishthi-putra Ehuvala Chamtamula, and Vashishthi-putra Rudra-purusha-datta. An inscription dated to the 30th regnal year of the Abhira king Vashishthi-putra Vasusena has also been discovered at the ruined Ashtab-huja-svamin temple. This has led to speculation that the Abhiras, who ruled the region around Nashik, invaded and occupied the Ikshavaku kingdom. However, this cannot be said with certainty.\n\nThe Ikshavaku kings constructed several Brahmanical temples dedicated to the deities such as Sarva-deva, Pushpabhadra, Karttikeya, and Shiva. Their queens, as well as Buddhist upasikas such as Bodhishri and Chandrashri, constructed several Buddhist monuments at the site. It is believed that Sadvaha authorised the first monastic construction at Nagarjunakonda. During the early centuries, the site housed more than 30 Buddhist viharas; excavations have yielded art works and inscriptions of great significance for the scholarly study of the history of this early period.\n\nThe last extant Ikshavaku inscription is dated to the 11th year (c. 309 CE) of Rudra-purusha: the subsequent fate of the dynasty is not known, but it is possible that the Pallavas conquered their territory by the 4th century. The site declined after the fall of the Ikshavaku power. Some brick shrines were constructed in the Krishna River valley between 7th and 12th centuries, when the region was controlled by the Chalukyas of Vengi. Later, the site formed the part of the Kakatiya kingdom and the Delhi Sultanate. During the 15th and the 16th centuries, Nagarjunakonda once again became an important site. The contemporary texts and inscriptions allude to a hill fortress at Nagarjunakonda, which was probably built by the Reddi rulers as a frontier fortress protecting their main fort of Kondaveedu. It later appears to have come under the control of the Gajapatis: a 1491 CE inscription dated to the reign of the Gajapati king Purushottama indicates that the Nagarjunakonda fortress was controlled by his subordinate Sriratharaja Shingarayya Mahapatra. In 1515, the Vijayanagara king Krishnadevaraya stormed the fortress during his invasion of the Gajapati kingdom.\n\nThe region was later ruled by the Qutb Shahi dynasty and the Mughals. It was subsequently granted as an agrahara to the pontiff of the Pushpagiri Math.\n\nIn 1926, a local schoolteacher, Suraparaju Venkataramaih, saw an ancient pillar at the site, and reported his discovery to the Madras Presidency government. Subsequently, Shri Sarasvati, the Telugu language Assistant to the Archaeological Superintendent for Epigraphy of Madras, visited the site, and it was recognized as a potential archaeological site.\n\nThe first discoveries were made in 1926 by French archaeologist Gabriel Jouveau-Dubreuil (1885-1945). Systematic digging was organized by English archaeologists under A. H. Longhurst during 1927-1931. The team excavated the ruins of several Buddhist stupas and chaityas, as well as other monuments and sculptures.\n\nIn 1938, T N Ramachandran led another excavation at the site, resulting in the discovery of some more monuments. In 1954, when the construction of the proposed Nagarjuna Sagar Dam threatened the site with submergence, a large-scale excavation led by R Subrahmanyam was started to salvage the archaeological material. The excavation, conducted during 1954-1960, resulted in the discovery of a number of relics, dating from the Early Stone Age to the 16th century. Later, around 14 large replicas of the excavated ruins and a museum were established on the Nagarjunakonda hill. Some of the sculptures excavated at Nagarjunakonda are now at other museums in Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Paris and New York.\n\nAn archaeological catastrophe struck in 1960, when an irrigation dam was constructed across the nearby Krishna River, submerging the original site under the waters of a reservoir In advance of the flooding, several monuments were dug up and relocated to the top of Nagarjuna's Hill, where a museum was built in 1966 Other monuments were relocated to the mainland, east of the flooded area. Dedicated archaeologists managed to recover almost all of the relics.\n\nArchaeological inscriptions at the site show that the Andhra Ikshvaku kings Virapurusadatta, Ehuvula and family members patronized Buddhism. The inscriptions also show state-sponsorship of construction of temples and monasteries, through the funding of the Ikshvaku queens. Camtisiri in particular, is recorded as having funded the building of the main stupa for ten consecutive years. The support also spread beyond the noble classes, many non-royal names being inscribed in the relics. At its peak, there were more than thirty monasteries and it was the largest Buddhist centre in South India. Inscriptions showed that there were monasteries belonging to the Bahuśrutīya and Aparamahavinaseliya sub-schools of the Mahāsāṃghika, the Mahisasaka, and the Mahaviharavasin, from Sri Lanka. The architecture of the area reflects that of these traditions. There were other monasteries for Buddhist scholars originating from the Tamil kingdoms, Orissa, Kalinga, Gandhara, Bengal, Ceylon (the Culadhammagiri) and China. There is also a footprint at the site of the Mahaviharavasin monastery, which is believed to be a reproduction of that of Gautama Buddha.\n\nThe great stupa at Nagarjunakonda belongs to the class of uncased stupas, its brickwork being plastered over and the stupa decorated by a large garland-ornament. The original stupa was renovated by the Ikshvaku princess Chamtisiri in the 3rd century, when ayaka-pillars of stone were erected. The outer railing, if any, was of wood, its uprights erected over a brick plinth. The stupa, 32.3 m in diameter, rose to a height of 18 m with a 4 m wide circumambulatory. The medhi stood 1.5 m and the ayaka-platforms were rectangular offsets measuring 6.7 by 1.5 m.\n\nMost of the Hindu ruins at Nagarjunakonda can be identified as Shaivite, wherever an identification is possible. One of the temples has an inscription naming the god as \"Mahadeva Pushpabhadraswami\" (Shiva). Stone images of Kartikeya (Skanda) were found at two other shrines. An inscription found at another excavated shrine refers to yet another Shiva shrine. At least one temple, attested by a 278 CE inscription, can be identified as Vaishnavite, based on the image of an eight-armed god. A large sculpture of Devi has also been discovered at the site.\n\nVarious remains suggesting Greco-Roman influence can be found at Nagajurnakonda. Roman coins were found, in particular Roman Aurei, one of Tiberius (16-37 CE), and the other of Faustina the Elder (141 CE), as well as a coin of Antoninus Pius. These finds seem to attest to trade relations with the Roman world. A relief representing Dionysus was also found in the Nagarjunakonda Palace site. He has a light beard, is semi-nude and carries a drinking horn, and here is a barrel of wine next to him.\n\n\nScythian influence can also be noticed, especially through the reliefs of Scythian soldiers wearing cap and coat. According to an inscription in Nagarjunakonda, a garisson of Scythians guards employed by the Iksvakus Kings may also have been stationned there.\n\nThe Nagarjunakonda inscriptions are a series of epigraphical inscriptions found in the area of Nagarjunakonda. The inscriptions are associated with the blossoming of Buddhist structures and the rule of the Ikshvaku, in the period covering approximately 210-325 CE.\n\nThe Nagarjunakonda inscriptions tends to stress the cosmopolitan nature of Buddhist activities there, explained that a variety of Buddhist monks came from various lands. An inscription in a monastery (Site No.38) describes its residents as acaryas and theriyas of the Vibhajyavada school, \"who had gladdened the heart of the people of Kasmira, Gamdhara, Yavana, Vanavasa and Tambapamnidipa\". The inscriptions suggest the involvement of these various people with Buddhism. \n\nThe inscriptions are either in Prakrit, in Sanskrit, or a mix of both, and are all in the Brahmi script. The Nagarjunakonda inscriptions are the earliest substantial South Indian Sanskrit inscriptions, probably from the late 3rd-century to early 4th-century CE. These inscriptions are related to Buddhism and to the Shaivism tradition of Hinduism, and parts of them reflect both standard Sanskrit and hybridized Sanskrit. \n\nThe spread of the usage of Sanskrit inscriptions to the south can probably be attributed to the influence of the Western Satraps who promoted the usage of Sanskrit in epigraphy, and who were in close relation with southern Indian rulers: according to Salomon \"a Nagarjunakonda memorial pillar inscription of the time of King Rudrapurusadatta attests to a marital alliance between the Western Ksatrapas and the Iksvaku rulers of Nagarjunakonda\". According to one of the inscriptions, Iksvaku king Virapurushadatta (250-275 CE) had multiple wives, including Rudradhara-bhattarika, the daughter of the ruler of Ujjain (\"Uj(e)nika mahara(ja) balika\"), possibly the Indo-Scythian Western Kshatrapa king Rudrasena II.\n\nThe Nagarjunasagar Dam is the tallest masonry dam in the world The excavated remains of the Buddhist civilisation were reconstructed and preserved at a museum on the island situated in the midst of the man-made Nagarjunasagar Lake The site has a 14th-century fort, medieval temples and a museum constructed like a Buddhist vihara The museum houses a collection of relics of Buddhist culture and art These include a small tooth and an ear-ring believed to be that of Gautama Buddha. The main stupa of Nagarjunakonda named Mahachaitya is believed to contain the sacred relics of the Buddha. A partly ruined monolithic statue of the Buddha is the main attraction at the museum. It also houses historic finds in the form of tools from Paleolithic and Neolithic times, as well as friezes, coins and jewellery.\n\nLocated in Guntur district it is not accessible on the State Highway. The nearest train station is at Macherla, 29 km away It is connected by a ferry to the mainland.\n\nThe area is also known for panoramic views of the valley from a viewing area near the dam, and is also the site of natural waterfalls, Ethipothala Falls which cascade down 22 m into a blue lagoon that is also a breeding centre for crocodiles. The nearby Srisailam wildlife sanctuary and the Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve are refuge for diverse reptiles, birds and animals. Srisailam, which sits on the shore of Krishna in the Nallamala Hills is a site of immense historical and religious significance, including a Shiva temple that is one of the 12 sacred Jyotirlingas.\n\n\n"}

The term was coined by art critique Merete Sanderhoff in her work \"Sorte Billeder\" [Black Pictures] as an attempt to categorise talents outside the avantgarde canon, that did not fit into any known art category. They are referred to as the black sheep of the contemporary art scene.\n\nThe passionist artists are concerned with the continuation of pre-avantgarde painting traditions without turning into a repetition of these works. They are not simply postmodernists because they actually take the content and the techniques of these traditional paintings seriously. The content focuses on narratives of riddles, yearning, and solemnity. That does not mean they lack humour, but their paintings are meant to be taken seriously. There is a tendency to create very dark paintings hence the title \"black pictures\". Furthermore, they often comment on the doctrines of the modern and postmodern art and art theories, moving beyond these rigid constraints.\n\nIn France, Passionism differs from the Scandinavian's in that these Passionist artists claim their art is \"born independently of the will of the artist, with no pre-planning or founding concept\" (www.passionism.com). This strain of Passionism was created by Cat Moss and metcuc in May 2000, and launched to the public at the Forum de Nice in 2002 (see press and radio archive footage, Nice Matin Press and Radio FR3). It further claims to be \"the first French artistic movement of the 21st Century, and the first artistic movement in the history of art to be spearheaded by women and followed by artists of all types around the globe. Passionist artists include writers, painters, photographers, poets, musicians, film directors, and fashion designers\" (www.passionism.com)\n\n"}

He was born in Chicago, Illinois and lived in the US until he was seven, when his parents separated and his Anglo-Irish mother brought him to live near London; he was educated at Dulwich College from 1900. After working briefly for the British Civil Service, he became a part-time teacher at Dulwich, supplementing his income as a journalist and writer—mostly for \"The Westminster Gazette\" and \"The Academy\". His output—consisting largely of poems and essays—was not to his taste, and his biographer Paul Bishop considers the work as \"lifeless\", while \"Contemporary Authors\" describes it as \"lofty in subject and mawkish in tone\". Chandler returned to the US in 1912 where he trained to become an accountant in Los Angeles. In 1917 he enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, saw combat in the trenches in France where he was wounded, and was undergoing flight training in the fledgling Royal Air Force when the war ended.\n\nChandler returned to the US in 1919 to rekindle his literary career, but instead took a job with an oil company until he was fired in 1932 following a bout of depression, womanizing and heavy drinking. He began writing crime stories for the pulp magazines \"Black Mask\", \"Detective Fiction Weekly\", \"The Fortnightly Intruder\" and \"Dime Detective\". The stories were subsequently brought together in collected editions. In 1939, at the behest of the publisher Alfred A. Knopf, Sr., Chandler wrote his first novel, \"The Big Sleep\", for which he used parts of his short stories \"Killer in the Rain\" (1935) and \"The Curtain\" (1936). He went on to write seven novels, many of which featured the character Philip Marlowe.\n\nIn 1944 Chandler was asked by Paramount Pictures to write the script for the film \"Double Indemnity\" with Billy Wilder; the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. It was the first of seven scripts Chandler wrote, although two of them were unused. In 1959 Chandler died of pneumonia, brought on by alcoholism. In the aftermath of his death, many of his unpublished writings—including letters, literary criticism and prose and poetry—were released. His biographer Tom Williams considers that Chandler's name has become \"a touchstone for crime writing, representing not just excellent fiction, but also a type of writing that is at once powerful and beautiful.\"\n\n\"The Rose Leaf Romance\" and \"Organ Music\" are two early short stories that were included in a collection, but their first printing is unknown.\n\nChandler left an unfinished novel when he died. This was completed by Robert B. Parker and published in 1989 as \"Poodle Springs\".\n\nMany of Chandler's works were used as the basis for films. The following are where he is credited as the writer of the performed script.\n\n"}

After the collapse of Fascism and the end of the war a violent independence movement that led to the institution of the region and the concession of the Statute, based on the model of federal states was born in Sicily.

A student chooses whether to take the test depending upon college entrance requirements for the schools in which the student is planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as Achievement Tests; and from 1995 until January 2005, they were known as SAT IIs. Of all SAT subject tests, United States History is taken the second most, with 119,903 administrations in 2009.\n\nThe test has 90 multiple choice questions that are to be answered in one hour. All questions have five answer choices. Students' scores are based entirely on their performance in answering the multiple choice questions.\n\nThe questions cover a broad range of topics. Approximately 31–35% of questions focus on political history, 13–17% focus on economic history, 20–24% focus on social history, 13–17% focus on intellectual and cultural history, and 13–17% focus on foreign policy.\n\nThe questions also vary with respect to time period; approximately 20% focus on period of the Pre-Columbian era to 1789, 40% focus on the period between 1790 and 1898, and 40% focus on the period between 1899 and the present day.\n\nFor each of the multiple choice questions, students receive 1 point for every correct answer, lose of a point for each incorrect answer, and receive 0 points for questions left blank. This creates a \"raw score\", which is then converted into a \"scaled score\". The conversion between these numbers varies depending on the difficulty of a particular test administration. The \"scaled score\" is the only score reported to either students or colleges and ranges from 200 to 800, with 800 being the best possible score. The mean and standard deviation of the test scores in 2009 were 599 and 115, respectively.\n\nThe College Board suggests as preparation for the test a year-long course in United States History at the college preparatory level. The test requires understanding of historical data and concepts, cause and effect relationships, geography, and the ability to effectively synthesize and interpret data from charts, maps, and other visual media. However, most questions from this test are derived from/similar to the AP US History Multiple Choice questions from 2014 and earlier (the 2015 exam has been revised). By taking an AP class, IB History of the Americas, or a class with similar rigor, the chances at doing well on this test are much improved.\n\n"}

[and were] . . . literally seats of power, prestige, and ritual.” Duhos made of wood and stone have both been found, though those made of wood tend not to last as well as the stone chairs and are, therefore, much rarer. This seat is one of two Taíno seats called \"Duho\" in the British Museum that were originally found on the island of Hispaniola. The other is also modelled anthropomorphically on a man, but in that case the resemblance to a man on his stomach is more proportional. There is another wooden duho in the collections of the British Museum that was found on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas.\n\nSome of the first people that Christopher Columbus met in the American continent were the Taino people. Their 7,000-year-old civilisation did not benefit from pre-colonial contact as many were later enslaved or died of disease. It was noted by early explorers that some of their time the Taino people were using hallucinogenic drugs. The drug and the pipes that were used are called cohoba. It is likely that one of these chiefs used this seat to smoke these drugs. The British Museum's seat has a bowl above the figures head, which may have been used to hold cohoba during rituals involving the Zemi gods.\n\nThis chair from the British Museum was chosen to be one of the History of the World in 100 Objects which was a series of radio programmes that started in 2010 and that were created in a partnership between the BBC and the British Museum.\n\n\n"}

It is set in Paris, where a still-quite-young woman is on the phone with her lover of the last five years. He is to marry another woman the next day, which causes her to despair. The monologue triggers the woman's crippling depression. \n\nIn 1948, Roberto Rossellini directed the film version of the play, an anthology film \"L'Amore\" which had two segments, \"Il Miracolo\" and \"Una Voce Umana\", the latter based on Cocteau's play. In 1958 Francis Poulenc composed an opera to Cocteau's text. Cocteau loved it: \"\"Mon cher Francis, tu as fixé, une fois pour toutes, la façon de dire mon texte\" (My dear Francis: you have worked out, once and for all, how to speak what I have written)\". On May 4, 1967, the final installment of the television series \"ABC Stage 67\" was a production of the play, starring Ingrid Bergman, who produced a commercial recording of it. There was also a 1998 BBC Radio production by Robin Rimbaud.\n\n"}

Described as the forefathers of Brechtian Punk Cabaret, the Tiger Lillies are well known for their unique sound and style which merges \"the macabre magic of pre-war Berlin with the savage edge of punk\".\n\nThe band's name is rumoured to have been inspired by a murdered Soho prostitute called Lillie who used to dress up in animal print. Jacques, however, has stated that he named the band after a painting he had on his wall. The band formed in 1989 when Martyn Jacques placed an ad on Loot looking for a drummer and a bass player for a new band. Adrian Huge and Phil Butcher (the band's first bassist who was succeeded by Adrian Stout in 1995) were the only musicians that got in touch with him and therefore became the original Tiger Lillies' drummer and bassist respectively.\n\nIn Spring 2012 Adrian Huge decided to take a leave of absence and was replaced by drummer Mike Pickering who toured with the Tiger Lillies from 2012. In early 2015 Pickering was in turn replaced by band's current drummer, Jonas Golland.\n\n\"The Independent\" has described The Tiger Lillies as \"a provocative and avant-garde three-piece band that combines cabaret, vaudeville, music-hall and street theatre\", while Tim Arthur of Time Out has given a more imaginative description: \"Imagine Kurt Weill conjuring up images of prewar Berlin while a falsetto vocalist screams, squeaks and squawks his way through every number like some rambling madman, and you've got the picture\". Notorious for singing controversial songs involving bestiality, prostitution, blasphemy and all other vice imaginable, The Tiger Lillies are undoubtedly not for the easily offended. Their musical style is mainly influenced by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill's masterpiece The Threepenny Opera and pre-war Berlin cabaret but other influences such as gypsy and circus music, French chanson and British music hall tunes are also evident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tiger Lillies have appeared in numerous shows, the following are listed according to their premiere date:\n\n\n"}

It was published in recognition of the 50th anniversary of Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 State of the Union address, in which he declared \"an unconditional war on poverty in America\".\n\nThe reports advances the argument that federal antipoverty programs suffer from defects that “penalize families for getting ahead” and that “the complex web of federal programs and sudden drop-off in benefits create extraordinarily high effective marginal tax rates,” both of which “reduce the incentive to work”. \n\nAt the core of the report are recommendations to enact cuts to welfare, child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs. In an appendix titled \"Measures of Poverty\", when the poverty rate is measured by including non-cash assistance from food stamps, housing aid and other federal programs, the report states that these measurements \"[have] implications for both conservatives and liberals. For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones.\" \n\nSeveral economists and social scientists, Amy Finkelstein, Jane Waldfogel, Chris Wimer, Jeffrey Brown and Barbara Wolfe, whose work had been referenced in the report said that Paul Ryan, the committee's chairman, either misunderstood or misrepresented their research. One of the issues raised was that the report cites data from 1969 onward, and according to Waldfogel this ignores a full 36 percent of the decline in poverty using the Supplemental Poverty Measurement since 1967. Brown stated after the article's publication that Ryan quoted his research accurately, and that the \"Fiscal Times\" misrepresented his comments. The \"Financial Times \" later updated the article based on Brown's comment. All of the statistical errors were later corrected, and Waldfogel's criticism was fixed.\n\n\n"}

As of late 2014, the church had over 10,000 members, making it the fifth largest religion in Slovenia.\n\nThe religion's origins are tied to the 2012–13 Slovenian protests where thousands of people protested against members of the Slovenian political elite, including the mayor of Maribor Franc Kangler, the Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša, the opposition leader and mayor of Ljubljana Zoran Jankovič, and corruption in politics in general. The church originally formed as The Church of the Blissful Ringing and later added \"Zombie\" and \"Trans-Universal\" to the name, the former because of the ruling Slovenian Democratic Party labelling the protesters as zombies during the people's uprising. The official name was chosen using a Facebook poll and the church uses this social network for various activities. In 2014, the church was registered in the national registry of religious communities, which, as of 2016, contains 48 churches and other religious communities. The church also started gaining members in the neighbouring Croatia. With more than 10,000 members, the church is the fifth largest religion in Slovenia, after the Roman Catholic Church, Islam, Serbian Orthodox Church, and the Lutheran Church.\n\nAccording to the members of the church, the theology and the rituals are not strictly defined. The members should believe in the \"Bell\" and that the Universe begun with a \"Big Bong\", which took place before the Big Bang. Among other things, the church requires members to have sex once per week and forbids planting of genetically modified crops and sexual assaults. Initially, the holy drinks of the church were beer, piña colada, and water, but this was later extended to include all drinks that members enjoy. The church states that it allows its members to adhere to some other religion as well but requires all members to be at least 15 years old. The church plans to officiate weddings, including same-sex marriages.\n\nEvery Wednesday, the members of the church gather around the \"Temple of Corruption\" (the National Assembly Building of Slovenia) for holy mass. During the mass, they use pots, pans, and bells to produce clanking sounds. In addition, the members are active in various charity activities, such as helping people without health insurance, homeless, single mothers, and in 2016 also Syrian refugees.\n\nThe Trans-Universal Zombie Church of the Blissful Ringing received a mixed reception upon formation. It has been labelled as a parody religion by a sociologist dr. Marjan Smrke, who compared it to the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster and Jediism. He considered the role of the church positive since it acts a reflection of the problems facing the Roman Catholic Church in Slovenia. The registration of the church drew criticism from a Catholic association Zavod za družino in kulturo življenja KUL, as being an insult to the Catholic community in Slovenia. The Archbishop of Ljubljana, Stanislav Zore, stated that the registration of religious communities falls within the responsibility of the government which has to outline clear criteria to see what constitutes a religious community. Critics mentioned that a motivation for the formation of the church included avoiding the upcoming real estate tax, from which certain religious objects are exempt. On the other hand, Ales Crnic, a cultural studies professor at Ljubljana University, stated that \"[The church] is a criticism of the modern state that has been failing to fulfil its social commitments.\"\n\n"}

Its source (\"Bosnian\": Vrelo Bune) is a strong karstic spring, emerging from a huge karstic cavern beneath a high vertical cliff.\nThis region is specific for the diversity of its above-ground and underground hydrography. The source of the Buna river is the finest example of an underground karst river. It's one of the largest and most beautiful springs in Europe, producing approx. 30 m/s with extremely cold and clean water.\n\nBlagaj is one of the most valuable urban-cum-rural structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Blagaj reached its peak of development in the 15th and 16th centuries, building in stone also reached its greatest extent. The first stone-built houses were the privilege of the wealthier class, but later, and lower-class families are also built sizeable stone houses and summer residences in large numbers. \nThe natural and architectural ensemble of Blagaj forms a spatially and topographically self-contained ensemble. \nThe region is also known for the diversity of its flora and a number of endemic species. At lower altitudes there are many evergreen plant and deciduous thicket species, while at higher altitudes in the hills there is sparse forest. Fertile cultivable land is suitable for the agriculture typical of the Mediterranean climate.\n\nThe architectural ensemble of the Blagaj Tekke (a Sufi lodge) stands by the source of the Buna river, not far from the centre of Blagaj. The musafirhana (guest house) and türbe (mausoleum) are tucked into the natural surroundings, constituting a single entity with the cliffs, source of the Buna river and mills. The musafirhana of the Blagaj tekke and the türbe have been preserved to this day. The musafirhana was built before 1664, and rebuilt in 1851 - its original appearance is not known. The building was subsequently repaired on several occasions. The ensemble of the Blagaj Tekke was presumably built very soon after Ottoman rule was established in Herzegovina, around 1520 at the latest.\n\nThere were four bridges over the 9 km of the Buna river, two in Blagaj, one in Kosor and one in Buna village. Blagaj's bridges, the Karađoz-beg bridge and Leho bridge, differ in certain features from the typological form of 16th century Ottoman architecture.\n\nMill buildings on the Buna river are simple stone-built structures with gabled roofs clad with stone slabs, and with one or more mills.\n\nResidential complexes were entirely isolated in relationship with the outside world, so that the courtyard became the most important area of the house. These complexes consisted of several different buildings serving different purposes, standing on a plot that was entirely open to the natural surroundings and forming a single unit with the architecture of the buildings.\n\nAccording to the nomination for the list of national monuments in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the title \"Townscape ensemble of the town of Blagaj\", drawn up by the Institute for the Protection of the Cultural, Historical and Natural Heritage of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the source of the Buna river with its cliffs constitutes a geomorphological natural monument, and the source of the Buna river a hydrological natural monument. Blagaj's architectural heritage and old urban quarters (\"mahalas\") indicates that buildings of major monumental and townscape value occupy a relatively confined area along the Buna river. Urban structures, spatial physiognomy and organization can be traced from the mediaeval outskirts of the fort, which were transformed in the Ottoman period into a \"kasaba\" (village-town). Both Oriental and Mediterranean features are to be seen in Blagaj's urban layout, while the settlement itself was the outcome of the influence of the natural phenomenons and configuration of the terrain, as well as socio-economic relations. A perfect harmony between each buildings and its environs was achieved.\n\n"}
