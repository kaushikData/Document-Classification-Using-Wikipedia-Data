Adding to someone else’s work has been a very common occurrence in graffiti for decades. In the urban environment, it is typically considered aggressive or antagonistic in nature, but also form of competition. However, it is still considered a taboo in the more established high arts, even though it has been practiced for over fifty years by stalwarts such as Rauschenberg in his \"Erased de Kooning Drawing\". In more recent examples, Banksy has done several added art pieces over Damien Hirst's \"spot\" painting, and Mat Benote used an untitled work by Robert Morris at the MoMA in NYC as a canvas. A very interesting example was done by the Chapman Brothers, who painted over sketches originally created by Adolf Hitler.\n\n\n"}

It is currently under consideration for designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nAhsikent occupies an area of more than 25 hectares. The city was founded between the 3rd - 2nd centuries B.C., and functioned up to 1219 A.D. It has been completely destroyed by Mongolian forces. The city structure consisted of the citadel, Shakhristan - the city itself and the \"rabad\" (suburb) of the city. All three parts of the city have been enclosed by the fortification. The palace of governors and zindan (prison) were situated in the arc. There was a city market, cathedral mosque, and a khouz, erected from baked brick in Shahristan. The craftsmen's area was located in the \"rabad\". Metallurgical production in Ahsiket was known far beyond Central Asia. It was the only place in Central Asia where very high-quality steel - known as Damascus or Damask steel - has been produced. At Ahsikent there was discovered a bath constructed in the 2nd century A.D. After the Mongolian invasion, new Ahsikent arose 5–6 km to the west of the ancient city.

{"id": "768817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=768817", "title": "Amusement", "text": "Amusement\n\nAmusement, from the old French \"à muser\" – to put into a stupid stare, is the state of experiencing humorous and entertaining events or situations while the person or animal actively maintains the experience, and is associated with enjoyment, happiness, laughter and pleasure. It is an emotion with positive valence and high physiological arousal.\n\nAmusement is considered an \"epistemological\" emotion because humor occurs when one experiences a cognitive shift from one knowledge structure about a target to another, such as hearing the punchline of a joke. The pleasant surprise that happens from learning this new information leads to a state of amusement which people often express through smiling, laughter or chuckling.\n\nCurrent studies have not yet reached consensus on the exact purpose of amusement, though theories have been advanced in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and sociology. In addition, the precise mechanism that causes a given element (image, sound, behavior, etc.) to be perceived as more or less 'amusing' than another, similar element to a particular individual is not clearly understood.\n\nTwo different theoretical perspectives about emotion provide contrasting origins of amusement:\n\nThe evolutionary perspective proposes that amusement is a distinct emotion that evolved to enhance a species’ survival. Collective laughter helps define an ingroup, helping people recognize those similar to them and feel included. It also helps identify outgroup members and enhance the barrier between the two. Laughter can provide network support as encouragement, or it can inform ingroup members that they are losing majority favor and to adjust their behavior to reassimilate.\n\nThe theory of constructed emotion suggests that when humans have a positive experience that increases their arousal, such as a faster heartbeat and increased sweat production, they cognitively seek out a label for that feeling. They will land on amusement if that experience resembles other amusement experiences they have had.\n\nThe origin of the study of emotional expression is often attributed to Charles Darwin. In 1872, Darwin published his book \"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\", in which he extensively describes his observations of how people and animals display emotions on their faces and through sound. Darwin comments on amusement as an emotion of great joy during which a person is likely to laugh. He also notes that across all peoples humans can laugh until they are panting and tears roll down their cheeks. In the 1960s, Paul Ekman, an American psychologist, revived the study of emotional expression, proposing, like Darwin, that emotions were universally recognizable. His early work focused on six basic emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise. By the 1990s, Ekman had expanded this list to include several additional emotions, one of which was amusement. \n\nDisplays of amusement have been distinguished from related emotions like embarrassment and shame. More recent studies have confirmed that laughter is a distinct signal of amusement and is recognizable across cultures.\n\nAn amused facial expression typically has these characteristics:\n\nThe expression of amusement is usually accompanied by genuine laughter. The experience of laughter changes the breathing pattern and often causes all the muscles to relax.\n\nAs a positive, high arousal emotion, amusement falls in the same category as excitement and exhilaration. These emotions are highly valued in American culture where positive feelings that high in energy are seen as ideal. In contrast, East Asian cultures value positive, low arousal emotions such as contentment, calm and peacefulness.\n\nEmotion regulation is the term for how people attempt to influence - increasing, decreasing, maintaining or changing - how, when, and where they experience emotion. Through changing how they think about a target of amusement, like a humorous video clip, people are able to increase and decrease how much amusement they feel, express in smiles and laughs, and experience in their bodies (e.g. increased heart rate and respiration). Choosing to increase or prolong experiences of positive emotion is one way in which people can learn to cope when faced with challenges and develop resilience.\n\nAs a positive emotion, amusement contributes to the development of resilience in both children and adults. Positive emotions help people build social resources that foster their ability to cope during hard times. Increases in resilience lead to higher life satisfaction and general happiness. \n\nRapidly growing in popularity, laughter therapy, or humor therapy, focuses on promoting laughter as a therapeutic tool. Usually implemented in a group, laughter therapy uses a variety of gag jokes like red noses and magic tricks to encourage laughter - fake or real. Laughter causes the bodies' muscles to relax which increases blood flow and oxygen intake. Proposed benefits include: Stress management, relaxation, improved mental functions, improved digestion and pain relief. Some suggest that laughter activates similar brain wave frequencies as a meditative state. However, scientific studies of these benefits are limited and have methodological issues.\n\n\n"}

She was a principal of the \"Dramatens elevskola\" and belong to the elite of Swedish 19th-century actors. She was known as Betty Deland until 1857 and then as Betty Almlöf. \n\nBetty Deland was the daughter of the actors Pierre Deland and Charlotta Deland. She was born into two famous Swedish theatrical families: her father was the director of the famous travelling Deland theater company, and her mother was the daughter of Isaac de Broen, director of the \"Djurgårdsteatern\". She was the niece of Louis Deland. \n\nBetty Deland made her debut in the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1836, the age of five, as a child actor in a boy's breeches role, Otto in \"Johanna of Montfaucon\". The following years, she made a success in children's roles. \n\nBetty Deland was engaged in her father's travelling Deland theater company from 1847 until 1861. She often performed a dance at the end of the performances of the Deland theater \"with a cachucha, performed in a Spanish costume in a very delightful way and with some of her father's French grace\".\n\nShe made her formal debut as an actress of her father's company in Uppsala in 1847. The travelling Deland theater was one of the most famed in both Sweden and Finland during its existence between 1833 and 1861: it performed in the theaters of smaller cities and towns in Sweden and Finland, which seldom had a permanent staff at this point in history, and inaugurated several of the new theaters which was erected during this time, when many small cities built their first permanent theater buildings to house the travelling theater companies. In Stockholm, they often performed in the \"Djurgårdsteatern\", and in Finland, the Deland company regularly performed in the \"Åbo Svenska Teater\", and they formed the first staff of the first national theater, the Swedish Theatre in Helsinki, which was inaugurated in the 1860-61 season. Betty Deland was a significant member of the Deland theater and well known in Sweden and Finland, and during her years there, she performed 300 roles in comedy and vaudeville. \n\nIn 1857, she married the actor Knut Almlöf, and was henceforth known as Betty Almlöf. Her spouse was also from a theater family, son of Nils Almlöf and Brita Catharina Cederberg and stepson of Charlotta Almlöf. \n\nIn 1861, Betty Almlöf was at the \"Mindre teatern\" in Stockholm with her spouse. When the theater was incorporated to the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1863, they were offered to stay. In 1866, she was contracted as a premier actress. She enjoyed great respect and came to have a successful career at the royal theater. She was active on the stage until the year of her death, in 1882. \n\nBeing previously known for comedy and vaudeville, her career shifted in the 1860s: \"At Mindre teatern and even more after her engagement at the royal stage, she evolved to the character roles, where she with equal ability performed the most shifting types. The same truth, the same balance, the same striking strength of line and the same direction toward realism, which signified the art of her husband, was also found in her, fostered as she was in the strict school of her genius father.\"\n\nShe was praised for her expressive mimic, her nuances of voice and her character acting, though her most popular roles mentioned in theater history remained those girls' roles and comic parts of the first half of her career. \n\nBetty Almlöf was an instructor and principal of the \"Dramatens elevskola\" jointly with her husband between 1874 and 1877.\n\nAmong her parts were Madame de Maintenon in \"Ludvig den fjortonde och markisinnan Maintenon\" (Louis XIV and Madame de Maintenon), Mrs Serpentier in \"Den gifta mannen i staden och på landet\" (The married man in the city and in the country), Emilia in \"Othello\", the queen dowager Hedwig Eleonora in \"Carl den elfte\" (Charles XI) by Teodor Hagberg, Belise in \"Lärdt folk i stubb\" (The precieuses) by Molière, Mrs Dupuis in \"Ett hem\" (A home) by Feuillet, Fadette in \"Syrsan\" (Le petite Fadette) by George Sand, Dorine in \"Tartuffe\", the Duchess of Marlborough in \"Ett glas vatten\" (A glass of water), Frosine in \"Den girige\" (The greedy one) by Molière, Madam Rundholmen in \"De ungas förbund\" (The union of the young) by Ibsen and the Duchess in \"Sällskap där man har tråkigt\" (Company where one is bored) by Pailleron.\n\n"}

The community aspect of BookCrossing.com has grown and expanded in ways that were not expected at the outset, in the form of blog or forum discussions, mailing lists and annual conventions throughout the world.\n\nLeaving reading materials in public places when no longer needed has long been a silent means of communication and sociability amongst bibliophiles. Ron Hornbaker conceived the idea for what is now known as BookCrossing in March 2001 and enlisted business partners and co-founders Bruce and Heather Pedersen to launch BookCrossing.com on April 21, 2001.\n\nAfter two years the website had over 113,000 members and by 2004 it was prominent enough to be referenced in an episode of the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\". The same year it appeared as a new word in the \"Concise Oxford Dictionary,\" although as of 2017 only Collins of the major online dictionaries retained it as a word. Membership surpassed 1,000,000 by March 2012 and the registered book count exceeded 8,500,000. By 2017, there were over 1.7 million members and over 11.7 million books travelling through 132 countries.\n\nIn July 2007 Singapore became the first country to give the practice official status, designating 2,000 locations in the country as 'hotspots', similar to Official BookCrossing Zones, in an initiative launched with the National Library of Singapore. The world's first official International BookCrossing Day took place on 21 April 2014.\n\nIn May 2005 BookCrossing.com won two People's Voice awards in the Webby Awards for best community website and best social/networking website. BookCrossing was also featured in a BBC Radio project broadcast as 84 Book Crossing Road, which involved releasing 84 copies of Helene Hanff's book \"84 Charing Cross Road\" around the world. The programme was nominated for a Sony Radio Academy Award in 2006.\n\nAnyone who wishes to officially participate in \"releasing\" books, whether leaving it in a public place or passing it on to a friend, may register on the BookCrossing.com website, although there is the option to remain anonymous when \"catching\" or recording the find of a book. BookCrossing.com users can 'go hunting', where a member will go to the website to view a list of books that have recently been \"released\", then go to the location it was left to \"catch\" it. Books may also be left at \"Official BookCrossing Zones\" (OBCZs), which are located in certain coffee shops, cafes, restaurants and other public places. The purpose of these locations is to get current members in the area to leave books to share with the public. This also advertises BookCrossing and creates more members.\n\nThere is a BookCrossing anniversary convention every April, where BookCrossers go to enjoy organized literary-related events and release books together. The location of the convention changes each year: Here is a list of past and forthcoming conventions:\nMany unofficial conventions or \"unconventions\" take place at other locations and times throughout the year, making it easier for BookCrossers who cannot travel internationally for the convention to gather and share their love of books.\n\nIn 2003, BookCrossing was criticized by the astrologer and novelist Jessica Adams, who claimed that books were being \"devalued\" by the website as BookCrossing could lead to lower sales of books and, therefore, the reduction in royalties being paid to authors. Most BookCrossers dispute this argument, however. They claim that the website introduces readers to authors and genres that they have not read before, that the website encourages more people to take up or reclaim reading as a hobby, and that some members, having read a book that they have enjoyed, will buy extra copies to distribute through BookCrossing.\n\nIn March 2005, Caroline Martin, managing director of the publisher Harper Press, said in a speech that \"book publishing as a whole has its very own potential Napster crisis in the growing practice of bookcrossing\". BookCrossers rebutted the link to Napster, saying that while music filesharing involves duplicating audio files countless times, BookCrossing doesn't involve duplicating books (and also does not involve violating copyright, as books can be sold or given away freely without permission of the publisher being needed). The founder of BookCrossing, Ron Hornbaker, originally wondered if people would make this comparison when BookCrossing was first launched.\n\n\n\n"}

The \"Stanzas\" formed the basis for \"The Secret Doctrine\" (1888), one of the foundational works of the theosophical movement, by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.\n\nMadame Blavatsky claimed to have seen a manuscript of the \"Book of Dzyan\" while studying esoteric lore in Tibet. She claimed this and other ancient manuscripts were safeguarded from profane eyes by the initiates of an Occult Brotherhood. The work had originally, according to Blavatsky, been written in the sacred language of Senzar. She wrote \n\nMax Müller and others have been skeptical. Max Müller is reported to have said that in this matter she was either a remarkable forger or that she has made the most valuable gift to archeological research in the Orient.\n\nIn other references Blavatsky claimed the \"Book of Dzyan\" belonged to a group of Tibetan esoteric writings known as the \"Books of Kiu-Te\". Blavatsky wrote before a standard transcription of Tibetan into the Latin alphabet had been agreed upon; it took David Reigle some time to establish that she was referring to what modern scholars write as \"rGyud-sde\", parts of a voluminous Buddhist corpus commonly referred to as the Tantras. Other researchers have suggested a source in Chinese Taoism or Jewish kabbala.\n\nSupposed verses from the same \"Stanzas of Dzyan\" were later published by Alice Bailey in \"A Treatise on Cosmic Fire\" in 1925. Bailey claimed these verses had been dictated to her telepathically by the Tibetan Master Djwal Kul.\n\nUfologist Desmond Leslie drew heavily on the \"Stanzas of Dzyan\" in his writing, and theorized that they had originally been produced on the lost continent of Atlantis.\n\nSwiss author Erich von Däniken claimed to have explored some of the book's content and its alleged history, reporting unsourced rumours that the first version of the book predates Earth, and that chosen people who simply touch the book will receive visions of what it describes.\n\nReferences to the \"Stanzas\" exist in the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft, for example in his short story \"The Haunter of the Dark\", and have been expanded upon by other writers who have worked within the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\nWhen \"The Secret Doctrine\" appeared, William Emmette Coleman was “outraged by Madame Blavatksy’s pretensions of Oriental learning, [and] undertook a complete exegesis of her works.\" He claimed that her main sources were H.H. Wilson’s translations of the Vishnu Purana; Alexander Winchell’s \"World Life: or, Contemporary Geology\"; Ignatius Donnely’s \"\" (1882); and other contemporary scientific and occult works, plagiarized without credit and, in his own opinion, used in a blundering manner that showed superficial acquaintance with the subjects under discussion. He further claimed that she took at least part of her \"Stanzas of Dzyan\" from the Hymn of Creation in the old Sanskrit Rig-Veda. Coleman promised a book that would expose all of H.P.B.’s sources including that of the word \"Dzyan\". \n\nIn her biography \"HPB: The Extraordinary Life and Influence of Helena Blavatsky\", Sylvia Cranston tackles the claim of plagiarism that was leveled by William Emmette Coleman. Her view, like Coleman's, is that HPB's plagiarism consisted of quoting primary sources, without acknowledging the secondary sources from which they came.\n\nCranston states that a research assistant of hers took on the task of finding Coleman's alleged 70 passages that HPB plagiarized from \"World-Life\", and could only find 6. Coleman himself, far from being an authority on occult material, was a clerk in the Quartermaster Department of the US Army. He was likely not an impartial judge, having written to Coues on July 8, 1890, \"I emphatically denounced and ridiculed the theory of occultism, of elementary spirits, etc., before the Theosophical Society was organized [in 1875], and from that time to this I have strenuously opposed Theosophy all the time.\" Coleman promised to publish a book that would \"prove\" his charges against Blavatsky regarding the \"Book of Dzyan\"; this book and its proof never appeared. The reason Coleman's book never appeared is that “Coleman lost his library and his notes in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and died three years later, his book unwritten”.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29880756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29880756", "title": "Gender system", "text": "Gender system\n\nGender systems are the social structures that establish the number of genders and their associated gender roles in every society. A \"gender role\" is \"everything that a person says and does to indicate to others or to the self the degree that one is either male, female, or androgynous. This includes but is not limited to sexual and erotic arousal and response.\" Gender identity is one's own personal experience with gender role and the persistence of one's individuality as male, female, or androgynous, especially in self-awareness and behavior.\nGender binary is one example of a gender system. A \"gender binary\" is the classification of sex and gender into two distinct and disconnected forms of masculine and feminine.\n\nIn cultures where the gender binary is prominent and important, transgender people are a major exception to the societal norms related to gender. Intersex people, those who cannot be biologically determined as either male or female, are another obvious deviation. Other cultures have their own practices independent of the Western gender binary.\n\nWhen European settlers first arrived in North America, they discovered different Native American tribes had different concepts of sex and gender. In the Native North American society \"berdaches\" were given that name to identify them as gender variants. The Europeans \"attempted to explain the berdache from various functional perspectives...in terms of the contributions these sex/gender roles made to social structure or culture.\" The term \"berdache\" was deemed inappropriate and insulting as time passed and awareness increased, so a new term was coined in 1990, \"Two-Spirit.\" There were many roles for male and female Two-Spirits, productive specialization, supernatural sanction and gender variation. Some widespread features of the variety of gender roles are: transvestism, cross-gender occupation, same sex (but different gender) sexuality, recruitment to different roles, special languages, ritual roles, and associations with spiritual power. Cross-dressing was the most visible marker but has proven a variable and less reliable indicator of status as a Two-Spirit. However the main interest is that these people are an accepted portion of their society. In some cases they were even given special respect and various honors. \nThe roles varied greatly between tribes. For example, a male variant might have to wear male clothing during warfare, but women’s clothing any other time. These gender roles were often decided at a young age. If a boy was interested in women’s activities, or vice versa, a gender variant role would likely be undertaken in adulthood. \"In some societies, same-sex sexual desire or practice did figure into the definition of one’s gender variant role, in others, it did not.\"\nIn the case of the Navajo, there were four genders: man, woman, masculine female-bodied nádleeh, and feminine male-bodied nádleeh. Intercourse between two people of different genders, regardless of biological sex, was not stigmatized. However, any sexual relationship between two of the same one gender was considered homosexual, and was strongly disapproved of. In the majority of Native American societies however, biological sex played no part in any gender variant role.\n\nIn Mohave society, pregnant women believed they had dreams forecasting the anatomic sex of their children. These dreams also sometimes included hints of their child’s future gender variant status. \nA boy who \"acted strangely\" before he participated in the boy’s puberty ceremonies in the Mohave tribe would be considered for the transvestite ceremony. Expressing interest in dolls, the domestic work of women, women’s gambling games, and inquiring about the female skirt were all ways a boy may be considered for the transvestite ceremony. Before the ceremony, relatives would try to dissuade him, but if the boy persists, they would assist in the preparations for the ceremony.\nThe ceremony itself was meant to surprise the boy. It was a test of willingness. Other nearby settlements would receive word to come and watch. A circle of onlookers would sing special songs. If the boy danced like a woman, it confirmed his status as an \"alyha\". He was then taken to a river to bathe, and was given a skirt to wear. The ceremony would permanently change his gender status within the tribe. He then took up a female name. The alyha would imitate many aspects of female life, including menstruation, puberty observations, pregnancy, and birth. The alyha were considered great healers, especially in curing sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis.\n\nA documentary film entitled \"Blossoms of Fire\", produced in 2000, depicts the people of Juchitán de Zaragoza, Oaxaca, Mexico. It follows the daily lives of the women as they run their businesses, wear colorfully bold traditional clothing and hold their heads firmly high as they carry the weight on top. The film clearly depicts the empowered women and the tolerance of homosexuality and transgender individuals. The community exemplifies an alternative gender system unlike the gender binary that has been established throughout the world. On many occasions this community has been criticized and labeled as a matriarchy; however, the individuals who are interviewed throughout the film tend to say otherwise. They strongly believe that their community is able to function because gender roles are not placed on individuals but rather that everyone is equal—for example there is no identifiable \"bread winner\". Children are taken care of by whoever can help; food is cooked by anyone who is able to and drinking beer and smoking is not only okay for the \"men\" of the community. Gay, lesbian, and transgender people tend to feel more accepted in this alternative gender system. Juchitán's society operates under a more egalitarian gender system in which men and women have different, but not exclusive roles, and in which these roles are not necessarily expected. Due to liberal gender performance, third genders also have more prominence in Juchitán than other parts of the world.\n\nThe machi are the shamans of the Mapuche people of Chile, and are viewed to a large extent by both Mapuche and the Chilean state as keepers of Mapuche political, cultural, and spiritual tradition and power. In many ways the machi represent an alternative gender system in that homosexual acts are more accepted, gender switching occurs, and the practice of polygamy took place. However, though it appears there is more gender freedom, gender switching occurs based on different shamanic practices performed, and the gender associated with the practice is either derived from physical sex based on reproduction etc. or from the hegemonic gender system of the nation of Chile. For example, political participation has become a masculine practice, while spiritual practices are considered feminine. While one does not have to be a physical \"male\" or \"female\" necessarily to perform these practices, they must channel that gender to perform them.\n\nThe machi were inevitably influenced by the dominant western gender system of Chile through state sponsored evangelization, (most Mapuche today are Catholic) and by the Indigenous Law. The Indigenous Law further politicized the machi and further subjected them in national discourse to the gender norms of the Chilean state, changing the way that machi perform gender. \"Machi juggle various gendered systems of knowledge and identities according to their intentions, who is present, and in what context\"\n\nIn Hindu India, there also exists different concepts of what is socially accepted when gender is in question. When compared to the native North Americans, the gender system is essentially binary, but the ideas themselves are quite different from Western thoughts. These ideas often come from religious contexts. Some Hindu origin myths feature androgynous or hermaphroditic ancestors. Ancient poets often showed this idea by presenting images with mixed physical attributes between the two sexes. These themes still exist in the culture, and are even still institutionalized. The most prominent group are the hijras.\n\n\"The recognition of more than two sex/genders is recorded in India as early as the eighth century BCE\". In modern India, the term hijra is most commonly meant as \"eunuch\" or intersexed, and is a term of sexual impotence. In the culture’s definition, a hijra is one born as a male, but adopts the clothing, behavior, and occupations of women. Their status in society is neither male nor female, neither man nor woman. When hijras are asked whether or not they are male or female, most often they respond with comments like \"We hijras are like women\", demonstrating their place in culture. Hijras walk, gesture, speak, and use facial expressions more common to women in India. They even take feminine names as part of their gender transformation. Becoming a Hijra however is not outside of Indian society. Being a hijra means making a commitment that gives social support and some economic security, as well as a cultural meaning, linking them to the larger world.\n\n\"A male who is not born biologically intersexed who wishes to become a hijra must transform his sex/gender through an emasculation operation\". This operation is a rebirth for the hijras, and contains elements of childbirth to symbolize this. The process includes castration, bloodletting, and special rituals. Among the hijra society there is a hierarchy of gurus, or teachers, and chelas, or disciples. In order for one to be accepted into the hijra society they must be sponsored by a guru, who in turn teaches them and helps them form a family.\n\nAs of November 11, 2013, the country of Bangladesh has decided to begin a third gender birth certificate.\n\nThe sādhin are similar to Hijras culturally. Their development is quite different however, and their existence is much less prominent. It is a girl’s choice to become a sādhin. They wear men’s clothing and keep their hair short. They commonly keep their female name and are still treated as a female in society, although the status of sādhin, like hijra, transcends the gender labels of India. A sādhin candidate must be a virgin, and swear to celibacy.\n\n\"Femminielli\" or \"femmenielli\" (singular \"femminiello\", cf. Standard Italian \"femmina\", \"a female\", \"-ello\", masculine diminutive suffix) is a term used to refer to a population of males with markedly feminine gender expression in traditional Neapolitan culture. It may be hard to define this term within modern Western notions of \"gay men\" versus \"trans women\" since both these categories overlap to a degree in the case of \"femminielli\" It has been noted that this term is not derogatory and does not carry stigma, with \"femminielli\" instead traditionally believed to bring luck. \n\nIt is often considered reductive to insert the Neapolitan \"femminiello\" within the macro-category of transgender usually adopted in Anglo-Saxon and North American contexts. The \"femminiello\", instead, could be considered as a peculiar gender expression, despite a widespread sexual binarism. The cultural roots of this phenomenon confer to the \"femminiello\" a cultural and even socially legitimized status. For the historical and symbolic coordinates of Naples, the identity construct of the \"femminiello\" is not superimposable to more common European and euro-centric transgender clusters. \n\nThe \"femminiello\" in Campania may enjoy a relatively privileged position thanks to their participation in some traditional events, such as \"Candelora al Santuario di Montevergine\" (Candlemas at the Sanctuary of Montevergine) in Avellino or the \"Tammurriata\", a traditional dance performed at the feast of Madonna dell'Arco in Sant'Anastasia. Generally, \"femminielli\" are considered good luck. For this reason, it is popular in the neighborhoods for a \"femminiello\" to hold a newborn baby, or participate in games such as bingo. \"Feminielli\" participate in games of Tombola or \"Tombolata dei femminielli\", a popular game performed every year on the 2nd of February, as the conclusive part of the Candlemas at the Sanctuary of Montevergine. Achille della Ragione suggests that recent surveys have shown that Neapolitans have a generally negative view of what he calls \"the politically correct model of homosexuality of a hypocritical do-gooder society\" (implying the mainstream Western gay culture), yet he contrasts \"femminielli\" as enjoying a favorable attitude from part of Neapolitan society.\n\nIn Polynesia there are many different terms for gender roles, for example in Tahiti the role is called māhū. In Samoa the male gender variant is called fa’afafine which means \"like a woman.\" Tuva and Tonga have terms also. In Tonga the term is fakaleiti and in Tuva the term is pinapinnaine. All of these terms are used when a male engages in women's work, clothes, speech tones, and nonverbal gestures. However, in Polynesia when a man crosses genders and \"acts like a woman\" he is not viewed as becoming a woman, but is suspended between male and female, being neither at the same time, but having the elements of both. They tend to be effeminate and interested in women’s household tasks, but do not dress exclusively as women. They often seek oral sex with men, who may ridicule them in public, but seek them out for pleasure in private.\n\nKathoey is the term used by both males and females that allows them to be alongside the normative masculine and feminine identities. Up until the 1970s hermaphrodites and cross-dressing men and women could all come under the term kathoey, however the term has been dropped for the cross-dressing masculine females who are now referred to as \"tom\". As a result of the shifts, kathoey today is most commonly understood as a male transgender category. Kathoey is derived from the Buddhist myth that describes three original human sex/genders, male, female, and a biological hermaphrodite or kathoey. Kathoey is not defined as merely being a variant between male or female but as an independently existing third sex.\n\nThe notable gender variant role in the Philippines is the bakla. Bakla are males with a feminine spirit, or core identity, who cross-dress and are assumed to take the receiving role in sex. In the Philippines, a \"real man\" is simply one who is not bakla. Since there are negative connotations of local terms for gender diversity, many bakla prefer to self-identify as gay, rather than a new gender. The baklas’ partners are not considered homosexual by Filipino society. Over time, baklas have tried to gain status as a third sex or gender as an attempt to normalize their nonconformity and be equal to males and females in society.<\n\nOyewumi observes that among the Yoruba people there was no concept of gender and no gender system at all before colonialism. She argues that colonial powers used a gender system as a tool for domination and fundamentally changing social relations among the indigenous.\n\nIn cultures where the difference between male and female in the gender binary is masculine and feminine, it is important to look at how same-sex sexuality changes between cultures. In some cultures, like the travestí, homosexual behavior moves one from one part of a gender binary to another.\n\nHomosexuality, and its effects on the individual’s place in society is sometimes drastically different in various other cultures. In certain Sambia people of New Guinea for example, it is believed that a boy is unable to reach puberty or maturity without first ingesting the semen, considered \"life-force\", of an older male. In addition, these Sambian people believe that a man is unable to replenish his semen on his own, so the ritual continues until a certain time, usually marriage, when he is told of a tree that exudes a milky semen-like sap he may ingest instead.\n\nIn Basotho society in contemporary Lesotho, girls and women may exchange long kisses, engage in cunnilingus, and even fall in love and form a marriage-like union. In this society however, sex requires penetration, and marriage requires a man as a husband. Therefore, in this context, there is no concept of lesbianism.\n\nIn \"The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough\", Anne Fausto-Sterling explores the possibilities of the intersex and how these individuals fit into the traditional labeling of \"male\" and \"female\". Her \"Alternative Model of Gender,\" is a proposition that allows for the inclusion of intersexual individuals into the traditional gender labeling system. Anne Fausto-Sterling proposes that a body does not necessarily have to fit into the orthodox gender binary set by a society, but rather can be categorized under the possibility of male, female, merm, ferm, and herm, which are labels given to individuals born with a variation in sex characteristics. Fausto-Sterling’s \"Of Gender and Genitals\" discuses the fate of the individuals born with \"ambiguous\" genitalia and the need to surgically correct the deviations these individuals propel into a male-female society. \nShe explores the need for allowing the body to be labeled as is, rather than configuring it into the expectations of society, as the traditional binary gender labeling calls for. The Alternative Model allows for this type of gender labeling.\n\nGendered violence is an important worldwide issue that can take place in different forms with varying consequences. It can be similar to a hate crime in which physical violence is specifically targeting the victim's gender. Transgender people and women experience the most gender violence but anyone can be a victim. Women are particularly at risk of gender violence in intimate relationships. Women are 10 times more likely to be a victim of intimate partner violence. This act of violence occurs in the public as well as the private domain and can sometimes be overlooked. Countless deaths have resulted from these severe crimes as seen in the film \"Two Spirits\". Organizations nationwide such as California Coalition Against Sexual Assault help to support and aid the Latino communities in particular to put an end to domestic violence. It is also a matter related to the dominant gender system, which often underlies the motives for gendered violence. The dominant gender system also creates structural violence.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15642", "title": "January", "text": "January\n\nJanuary is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars and the first of seven months to have a length of 31 days. The first day of the month is known as New Year's Day. It is, on average, the coldest month of the year within most of the Northern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of winter) and the warmest month of the year within most of the Southern Hemisphere (where it is the second month of summer). In the Southern hemisphere, January is the seasonal equivalent of July in the Northern hemisphere and vice versa.\n\nAncient Roman observances during this month include Cervula, and Juvenalia; celebrated January 1, as well as one of three Agonalia, celebrated January 9, and Carmentalia, celebrated January 11. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.\n\nJanuary (in Latin, \"Ianuarius\") is named after the Latin word for door (\"ianua\"), since January is the door to the year and an opening to new beginnings. The month is conventionally thought of as being named after Janus, the god of beginnings and transitions in Roman mythology, but according to ancient Roman farmers' almanacs Juno was the tutelary deity of the month.\n\nTraditionally, the original Roman calendar consisted of 10 months totaling 304 days, winter being considered a month-less period. Around 713 BC, the semi-mythical successor of Romulus, King Numa Pompilius, is supposed to have added the months of January and February, so that the calendar covered a standard lunar year (354 days). Although March was originally the first month in the old Roman calendar, January became the first month of the calendar year either under Numa or under the Decemvirs about 450 BC (Roman writers differ). In contrast, each specific calendar year was identified by the names of the two consuls, who entered office on May 1 or March 15 until 153 BC, from when they entered office on January 1.\n\nVarious Christian feast dates were used for the New Year in Europe during the Middle Ages, including March 25 (Feast of the Annunciation) and December 25. However, medieval calendars were still displayed in the Roman fashion with twelve columns from January to December. Beginning in the 16th century, European countries began officially making January 1 the start of the New Year once again—sometimes called \"Circumcision Style\" because this was the date of the Feast of the Circumcision, being the seventh day after December 25.\n\nHistorical names for January include its original Roman designation, Ianuarius, the Saxon term \"Wulf-monath\" (meaning \"wolf month\") and Charlemagne's designation Wintarmanoth (\"winter / cold month\"). In Slovene, it is traditionally called \"prosinec\". The name, associated with millet bread and the act of asking for something, was first written in 1466 in the Škofja Loka manuscript.\n\nAccording to Theodor Mommsen, 1 January became the first day of the year in 600 AUC of the Roman calendar (153 BC), due to disasters in the Lusitanian War. A Lusitanian chief called Punicus invaded the Roman territory, defeated two Roman governors, and killed their troops. The Romans resolved to send a consul to Hispania, and in order to accelerate the dispatch of aid, \"they even made the new consuls enter into office two months and a half before the legal time\" (March 15).\n\n\n\n\"This list does not necessarily imply either official status or general observance.\"<br>\n\n\n\"This list does not necessarily imply either official status or general observance.\"\n\n\"All Baha'i, Islamic, and Jewish observances begin at sundown prior to the date listed, and end at sundown on the date in question.\"\n\n\"This list does not necessarily imply either official status or general observance.\"\n\nFirst Monday: January 1\nFirst Sunday of the year, unless the Sunday falls on January 1, 6, or 7, then January 2: January 2\nJanuary 2 unless that day is a Sunday, in which case January 3: January 2) \nFirst Friday: January 5 \nSunday following January 6: January 7 \nMonday after January 6: January 8 \nSecond Monday: January 8\nFriday before third Monday: January 12\nSecond Saturday: January 13 \nThird full week of January: January 15–19\nThird Monday: January 15\nWednesday of the third full week of January: January 17\nFriday between January 19–25: January 19\nThird Friday: January 19\nThird Sunday: January 21\n11th Sunday before Pascha (Eastern Christianity): January 21\nSunday closest to January 22: January 21\nLast week of January: January 22–26\nFourth Monday: January 22\n63 days before Pascha (Eastern Christianity): January 27\nLast Saturday: January 27\n9th Sunday before Easter in Western Christianity: January 28\n10th Sunday before Pascha in Eastern Christianity: January 28 \nLast Sunday: January 28\nJanuary 30 or the nearest Sunday: January 28\nMonday Closest to January 29: January 29\nLast Monday in January: January 29\nSecond Monday before Clean Monday in Eastern Christianity: January 29–31\n\n"}

Together with Oskar Strnad, he created the Vienna School of Architecture, and its concept of Modern houses, housing and interiors.\n\nJosef Frank was of Jewish ancestry. His parents, merchant Ignaz (Isak) Frank (October 17, 1851 – January 27, 1921 Vienna) and the Vienna-born Jenny (September 3, 1861–10 February 1941 Vienna), were originally from Heves in Hungary. He designed his parents' grave in the old Jewish section of Vienna's Central Cemetery (Group 19, Row 58, Grave No.52). He studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology. He then taught at the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts from 1919 to 1925. He was a founding member of the Vienna Werkbund, initiator and leader of the 1932 project Werkbundsiedlung in Vienna. In 1933, he emigrated to Sweden, where he gained citizenship in 1939. He was the most prestigious designer in the Stockholm design company Svenskt Tenn (Swedish Pewter). He remained in Sweden after 1945 despite attempts to return him to Vienna. The Vienna Circle manifesto lists three of his publications in a bibliography of closely related authors. He was also the brother of the physicist, mathematician, and philosopher Philipp Frank.\n\nJosef Frank dealt early on with public housing and housing estates. Contrary to most other architects of the interwar period in Vienna, he took the idea of settlement and not the creation of so-called super blocks in the municipal housing. He also rejected facade decor and clearly preferred functional forms.

In 2011, she became the first woman to throw batting practice to an MLB team, the Cleveland Indians during spring training. In 2015, hired by the Oakland Athletics for a two-week coaching stint in their instructional league in Arizona, she became the first female coach employed by an MLB team.\n\nSiegal coached Team Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic in March 2017.\n\nSiegal was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and is Jewish. Her grandfather and grandmother endowed the Cleveland College of Judaic Studies, now affiliated with Case Western Reserve University called the Laura and Alvin Siegal Lifelong Learning Program. Her grandfather also led the fundraising for Israel Bonds in Cleveland for a number of years.\n\nSiegal grew up in Cleveland Heights, a suburb of Cleveland. She was introduced to baseball at a very young age, as her grandfather Alvin Siegel frequently took her to Cleveland Indian baseball games. Her father, Michael, always signed her up for baseball, rather than for softball. At 13, her baseball coach told her she didn't belong in baseball because she was a woman and baseball was a man's sport. She believed that this was wrong, and continued playing baseball despite people who discouraged her from playing baseball because it was a \"man's sport\". At age 16 she made it her goal to coach baseball at a collegiate level, despite being discouraged by others from playing and coaching baseball at this age as well. She attended the Brewster Academy (where she played baseball for two years) and Hawken High School (her freshman and senior years). In high school, she played third base and pitched.\n\nSiegal attended Beloit College and holds a B.A. from St. Olaf College with a concentration in \"Leadership: Religion, Military, and Baseball\", an M.A. in Sport Studies from Kent State University, and a Ph.D. in Sport and Exercise Psychology from Springfield College (MA). Her academic focus is in performance enhancement, sport management, coaching, gender equity, and youth sports. Siegel knew the difficulties of trying to be a baseball coach, so she went on to pursue her Ph.D to equal the level of opportunities.\n\nSince 2011, Siegal is the Director of Sports Partnerships at the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University. As the Director she works towards expanding academic programs and relationships with Major League Baseball and other sports organizations.\n\nIn 2002, Siegal formed the Sparks, the first all-girl team to compete in a national \"boys\" baseball tournament. A documentary film, \"Girls of Summer\" (not to be confused with the 1988 film of the same title), was made about the team.\n\nAlong with coaching youth baseball, Siegal was assistant coach for the Springfield College baseball team, the only woman coach in the collegiate baseball ranks in the years of 2008-10.\n\nIn addition Siegal has been a coach and Technical Commissioner for the International Baseball Federation, where she has coached for the World Children’s Team USA. The team won the gold medal at the Women’s Baseball World Cup.\n\nSiegal in 2009 became the first female coach of a professional men's baseball team, when she worked for the Brockton Rox, in the independent Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball, as the first-base coach.\n\nIn 2011, at the age of 36, she was the first woman to throw batting practice to an MLB team, the Cleveland Indians during spring training. Catcher Paul Phillips, to whom she pitched, said: \"I thought she did great. She would fit right in. Had you not seen her pony tails, you would not have thought anything of it.\" Siegal said: \"This is my biggest day in baseball so far. This is the greatest game on earth.\" She has also thrown batting practice to the Oakland Athletics, Tampa Bay Rays, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, and New York Mets.\n\nSiegal was hired by the Oakland Athletics in October 2015 for a two-week coaching stint as a guest instructor in their instructional league in Arizona, becoming the first female coach employed by a Major League Baseball team. David Frost, the A’s assistant general manager, stated that they were thrilled that \"Justine will be joining us for instructional league... she brings with her a wealth of knowledge and expertise from years of playing, coaching, and teaching the game and all of our young players will benefit greatly from her time in camp.\"\n\nIn September 2016 she was the mental skills coach for Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic qualifier. In November 2016 it was announced that she would return as the same role in the main tournament in March 2017.\n\nGrowing up being told that baseball is a sport for man, while softball is the sport for women, influenced her to start her own nonprofit organization called Baseball For All when she was 23 years old. Siegal is the founder and executive director of Baseball for All, an organization that works toward gender equity in youth baseball by strongly encouraging and providing opportunities for girls to participate in baseball.\n\nBaseball For All encourages and provides equal opportunities for girls with the same passion for baseball to connect and foster that passion playing baseball. Through Baseball For All she is trying to get rid of the status quo of females being discouraged from playing baseball. Baseball For All encourages young girls to pursue their love for baseball, and educates the public on the importance of equal opportunities for men and women. The programs works on giving girls the sources needed to participate in the sport whether it means becoming a player, coach, umpire, or filling other baseball roles in hopes that other communities will extend their baseball programs to girls.\n\n"}

The show featured the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy entertainers, athletes and business moguls.\n\nIt was hosted by Robin Leach for the majority of its run. When Leach was joined by Shari Belafonte in 1994, the show was renamed Lifestyles with Robin Leach and Shari Belafonte. Leach ended each episode with a wish for his viewers that became his signature catchphrase, \"champagne wishes and caviar dreams.\"\n\nThe theme song, titled \"Come With Me Now\" and performed by Bill Conti, is from a 1979 film called \"Five Days from Home.\"\n\n\"Lifestyles\" was one of the first shows to feature the lives of the wealthy. Later shows such as VH1's \"The Fabulous Life Of...\" continued this trend. The show was largely intended to be an insight into the opulent residences and the glamorous lifestyles of those it profiled. However, many of the geographic areas it covered were ideal destinations for vacations, and in his on-camera appearances, Leach indirectly made references to resorts and tourist attractions. David Greenspan (aka David Perry), who was the voice-over narrator for most of the segments during the bulk of the show's run and could be heard whenever Leach did not appear on camera, made more direct references to such resorts and such tourist attractions during his tenure as the show's voice-over narrator.\n\n\"Lifestyles\" was created by Alfred M. \"Al\" Masini, who had also created \"Solid Gold,\" \"Entertainment Tonight,\" and \"Star Search;\" all of these were part of his Operation Prime Time project, which he later renamed Television Program Enterprises and later merged with Rysher Entertainment to form Rysher TPE, though \"Solid Gold\" or \"Entertainment Tonight\" were never syndicated by TPE or Rysher but all 4 are now owned by CBS Television Distribution.\n\n\"Lifestyles\" had two companion spinoff series, \"Runaway with the Rich and Famous\", also hosted by Leach.

The museum was originally instituted as a natural history museum with a focus on the natural history and environment of Nevada and the broader Southwestern United States. In December 2011, the Barrick joined the UNLV College of Fine Arts and became the anchor of the Galleries at UNLV. The six galleries and one museum that make up the Galleries are each entities in their own right linked via a common administration. The Marjorie Barrick Museum (the Barrick), is a well-known venue for engaging exhibitions and events and promotes engagement with the visual arts among a broad community including UNLV students, faculty, and staff; the greater Las Vegas community; and the national and international art community.\n\nThe founding of a natural history museum at the university—then an institution only a decade old, known as Nevada Southern University—began with a collection of specimens from the Desert Research Institute (DRI), the Nevada System of Higher Education's graduate research institute. In September 1967, the DRI opened a small museum facility in premises across from the university's grounds, as part of an expansion of DRI's activities into southern Nevada. The museum was created under the direction of archaeologist Richard H. Brooks, assistant research professor at the university and a researcher (later director) of the DRI-affiliated Nevada Archaeological Survey. Its exhibits consisted of DRI's local collection of living desert animal specimens and Native American artifacts.\n\nIn 1969 the university took over the management of the museum from DRI. Brooks remained as director of the university-affiliated museum, and during his tenure, the museum's funding was established and further permanent exhibits acquired. The most significant acquisition occurred in 1979, when a private collection of pre-Columbian art was donated by a former UNLV alumna, Mannetta Braunstein, and her husband Michael. These pieces would form the basis of a broadening collection of Mesoamerican and Aridoamerican cultural artifacts, acquired through other donations and further additions from the Braunsteins' purchases in Latin American markets.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the museum began the process of relocating to premises situated on the UNLV campus, to occupy a building that had contained the university's original gymnasium. Renovations to accommodate the museum were completed in 1981. Further alterations and expansions to the building were subsequently undertaken, and a research laboratory wing was added in 1994.\n\nBeginning in 1979 the museum's anthropological collections were greatly expanded, with the subsequent additions of donated collections of ethnographic and archaeological artifacts representing Native American and pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures.\n\nBrooks left the position in 1981. His successor as museum director was ornithologist and former UNLV president (1973–78) Donald Baepler, who was returning to the university campus after a three-year term as chancellor of the Nevada university system. Baepler was instrumental in establishing UNLV's Harry Reid Environmental Research Center, and the museum was reorganized to become one of the center's operating divisions. Baepler retired as museum director in 2004, retained a title as emeritus executive director of the museum.\n\nIn 1989 the museum was renamed in honor of Marjorie Barrick, a longstanding benefactor of the university. In 1980 Barrick, a prominent philanthropist married to a Las Vegas real estate developer, had gifted UNLV with an endowment of some $1.2million from her late husband's estate, to fund an ongoing series of public lectures at the university. Speakers at the Barrick Lecture Series have included international figures and heads of state, such as Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Mikhail Gorbachev and F. W. de Klerk.\n\nIn 2011, the Barrick closed its doors to undergo a change of hands with departments as well as begin remodeling of the museum. The Marjorie Barrick ceased to be affiliated with the Harry Reid Center and Department of Archaeology and is now a part of the College of Fine Arts at UNLV. The entire museum underwent drastic renovations, from its Collections Room to the Exhibition Hall, which changed how the public is able to interact with the space from piece to piece.\n\nAfter the Las Vegas Art Museum (or LVAM) closed its doors in 2009, their collection was left without a home. In 2012 the LVAM collection moved to the newly renovated Barrick Museum, as part of a partnership between LVAM and UNLV.\n\nThe Collections at the Marjorie Barrick Museum include:\n–The Barrick Museum is committed to collecting art of the present. This commitment is supported entirely through the generosity of artists and collectors who donate in-kind gifts of art. The bulk of the works in the collection include artists with ties to the greater Las Vegas valley forming a heritage collection of works created in and inspired by the Southern Nevada region.\n–The cultural collection began to form in 1969 and includes cultural objects from the American Southwest and Mesoamerica. The Pre-Columbian collection was initiated in 1979 with a gift from Dr. Michael C. and Mannetta Braunstein. Today, the museum's holdings include the Dr. Michael C. and Mannetta Braunstein Collection, a comprehensive collection of Pre-Columbian objects from nearly every culture of Pre-Columbian Latin America, as well as Mexican dance masks and retablos; Guatemalan, Bolivian, and Navajo textiles; Paiute and Hopi basketry; and Navajo jewelry. A variety of methodologies have been used at different times to collect, classify, analyze, and describe collection material, and the collections provide rich primary source information for multi-, cross-, and interdisciplinary studies. The Museum is compliant with guidelines mandates by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA).\n–Works in the collection include national and international artists such as Llyn Foulkes and William T. Wiley, as well as a significant representation of UNLV graduates.\n–The Barrick Museum houses the Dorothy and Herbert Vogel 50x50 Collection. In 2010, UNLV was the recipient of 50 contemporary works from the celebrated collectors. Beginning in 1962, New York postal clerk, Herbert Vogel, and his librarian wife, Dorothy, began collecting contemporary works of art. The couple dedicated all of Herb's salary to buying art, and in a few decades had amassed a collection encompassing some 4,000 works. Today, these works form one of the most remarkable collections of contemporary art in America. Motivated by the desire to share their collection with the public, the couple developed a program to gift 50 works to one institution in each of the 50 states. This program became known as Vogel 50x50. The collection includes the work by such notables as Stephen Antonakos, Neil Jenney, Lynda Benglis, Lucio Pozzi, Edda Renouf, Bettina Werner and Richard Tuttle.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3086235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3086235", "title": "Metate", "text": "Metate\n\nA metate or metlatl (or mealing stone) is a type or variety of quern, a ground stone tool used for processing grain and seeds. In traditional Mesoamerican culture, metates were typically used by women who would grind lime-treated maize and other organic materials during food preparation (e.g., making tortillas). Similar artifacts are found all over the world, including China.\n\nWhile varying in specific morphology, metates adhere to a common shape. They typically consist of large stones with a smooth depression or bowl worn into the upper surface. The bowl is formed by the continual and long-term grinding of materials using a smooth hand-held stone (known as a \"mano\"). This action consists of a horizontal grinding motion that differs from the vertical crushing motion used in a mortar and pestle. The depth of the bowl varies, though they are typically not deeper than those of a mortar; deeper metate bowls indicate either a longer period of use or greater degree of activity (i.e., economic specialization). The specific angles of the metate body allow for a proficient method of turning grains into flour.\n\nAnother type of metate called a grinding slab may also be found among boulder or exposed bedrock outcroppings. The upper face of the stone is used for grinding materials, such as acorns, that results in the smoothing of the stone's face and the creation of pocked dimples (see image).\n\nCarved, volcanic-stone ceremonial metates represent one of the most unusual and complex traditions of pre-Columbian artifacts from Costa Rica. They come in many different forms, and morphological variation corresponds to different regions and time periods. They can be rectangular, circular, flat, or curved. They may or may not have rims and between three and four legs. Some exhibits show signs of use-wear while others show no signs of wear and appear to have been made specifically for use as burial goods. Some examples characterized as metate might have actually been a type of throne for sitting on – not a metate at all.\n\nSome examples are known as effigy-headed metate, which feature an animal’s head at one end, with the metate itself making up the body of the creature. Animals typically depicted are jaguar, crocodile or birds. The most complex type of ceremonial metate is the class referred to as “flying-panel” metate. This style comes from the Atlantic watershed region, including the City of Guayabo and represents a high level of craftsmanship and complexity. Carved from a single piece of stone, these metates typically contain multiple figures, both underneath the plate and on the legs. Trophy heads, birds, jaguar, monkey and saurian figures are the most common themes. The “flying panel” metate is believed to be the precursor to free standing sculptural figures more common later in the Atlantic watershed region.\n\nThe earliest traditions of stone sculpture in Costa Rica, including ceremonial metate, began in late Period IV (A.D. 1–500). Metate from the Nicoya/Guanacaste region have longitudinally curved and rimless plates. Those from the Atlantic Watershed have a plate that is horizontally flat and rimmed. Both are associated with mortuary goods, suggesting differential social status existed within these communities. The three main types of Costa Rican stone sculpture at this time—tripod-metate, mace heads and jade “axe-god” pendants—peaked and declined in use during Period V (A.D. 500–1000).\n\nStone sculpture was never popular again in the Nicoya/Guanacaste region, but in the Atlantic Watershed (such as from Guayabo) by Period VI (A.D. 1000–1500), freestanding figural sculpture and new forms of ceremonial metate came into use. These new metate types might be rectangular with four legs like the jaguar effigy-head examples or might be round in shape with a pedestal base. These latter types often have carved human heads (or just suggestive notches) around the rim implying a relationship with ritual trophy-head taking. This particular form of metate seems to have been influenced by the stone sculptures of the Panamanian site of Barriles.\n\nAt the site of Las Huacas, fifteen metates were excavated from sixteen graves. None of these metates had manos (grinding stones), suggesting that the carved metate as a mortuary object had a deeper symbolic meaning than just the processing of foodstuffs. The metate’s basic mechanical purpose is a platform on which (primarily) maize is ground into flour. This transformation of grain to flour has symbolic implications relating to life, death and rebirth. It is still not clear if maize was a main source of sustenance, and it is entirely possible that maize was reserved for making chicha (beer), for use in ritual feasting activities. Given their role as a burial good, it seems that metate held a strong meaning for human life, death and the hope for a rebirth or transformation of some kind.\n\nThe three most popular iconographic elements of ceremonial metate seem to be saurian, bird, and jaguar creatures. Monkeys are also common. A unique feature of ceremonial metate is the lack of human figures. Disembodied heads are the sole exception. While human figures become the main subject of the free standing sculptures, which depict nude females or male warriors with trophy heads and bound male captives, these do not seem to have been depicted on metate. Flying-panel metates often have anthropomorphic figures, but these always have animal (often crocodile) heads.\n\nIn both the Nicoya and Atlantic-Watershed regions, metates are often made with saurian (specifically crocodile, alligator, or caiman) imagery. It is thought that the saurian represents the surface of the earth, which relates to agricultural fertility. One of the oldest and most prominent themes in Chibcha art is that of the Crocodile god. Depicted as an anthropomorphic being with a crocodile head, he has been carved into fly-panel metates, sometimes shown standing on a double-headed saurian and other times on a jaguar. As a symbol, the double-headed Saurian has the longest use and distribution of any iconographic element in the Isthmo-Columbian area.\n\nCosta Rica flying-panel metates date to the 1st and 7th centuries. However, certain features of the Crocodile god depicted on flying-panel metates show him with unnatural U-shaped elbows and long, narrow fingers, as seen on crocodile gods made in gold that date to the 10th–16th centuries. These stylistic forms make sense for use in the small gold ornaments made with the lost-wax technique, but seem strange for use in carved stone. Perhaps these metates date much later than previously thought, and were inspired by the depictions in gold.\n\nBirds with long, curving beaks that seem to represent vultures, toucans or maybe hummingbirds are another popular theme. First found in Costa Rica on Pavas and El Bosque-phase pottery, these are a common element in flying-panel metates, sometimes depicted with or pecking at human heads.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "159890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159890", "title": "Palatine Hill", "text": "Palatine Hill\n\nThe Palatine Hill (; ; ) is the centremost of the Seven Hills of Rome and is one of the most ancient parts of the city. It stands 40 metres above the Roman Forum, looking down upon it on one side, and upon the Circus Maximus on the other. From the time of Augustus Imperial palaces were built here.\n\nThe hill is the etymological origin of the word \"palace\" and its cognates in other languages (, , Spanish: \"palacio,\" Portuguese: \"palácio,\" , , etc.).\n\nThe term \"palace\", from Old French \"palais\" or \"paleis\", stems ultimately from the proper name of Palatine Hill. \n\nThe Palatine Hill is also the etymological origin (via the Latin adjective \"\") of \"palatine\", a 16th century English adjective that originally signified something pertaining to the Caesar's palace, or someone who is invested with the king's authority. Later its use shifted to a reference to the German Palatinate. The office of the German count palatine (\"Pfalzgraf\") had its origins in the \"comes palatinus\", an earlier office in Merovingian and Carolingian times.\n\nAnother modern English word \"\", came into usage to refer to any distinguished knight (especially one of the Twelve Peers of Charlemagne) under Charlemagne in late renditions of Matter of France.\n\nAccording to Livy (59 BC – AD 17) the Palatine hill got its name from the Arcadian settlement of Pallantium. More likely, it is derived from the noun \"palātum\" \"palate\"; Ennius uses it once for the \"heaven\", and it may be connected with the Etruscan word for sky, \"falad\".\n\nAccording to Roman mythology, the Palatine Hill was the location of the cave, known as the Lupercal, where Romulus and Remus were found by the she-wolf Lupa that kept them alive.\n\nAnother legend occurring on the Palatine is Hercules' defeat of Cacus after the monster had stolen some cattle. Hercules struck Cacus with his characteristic club so hard that it formed a cleft on the southeast corner of the hill, where later a staircase bearing the name of Cacus was constructed.\n\nRome has its origins on the Palatine. Excavations show that people have lived in the area since the 10th century BC. Excavations performed on the hill in 1907 and again in 1948 unearthed a collection of huts believed to have been used for funerary purposes between the 9th and 7th century BC approximating the time period when the city of Rome was founded. \n\nAccording to Livy, after the immigration of the Sabines and the Albans to Rome, the original Romans lived on the Palatine. The Palatine Hill was also the site of the ancient festival of the Lupercalia.\n\nMany affluent Romans of the Republican period (c.509 BC – 44 BC) had their residences there.\n\nFrom the start of the Empire (27 BC) Augustus built his palace there and the hill gradually became the exclusive domain of emperors; the ruins of the palaces of at least Augustus (27 BC – 14 AD), Tiberius (14 – 37 AD) and Domitian (81 – 96 AD) can still be seen.\n\nAugustus also built a temple to Apollo here.\n\nThe great fire of 64 AD destroyed Nero's palace, but he replaced it by 69 AD with the even larger Domus Aurea over which was built Domitian's Palace \n\nThe Palatine Hill is an archaeological site open to the public (requires payment).\n\nThe Palace of Domitian which dominates the site and looks out over the Circus Maximus was rebuilt largely during the reign of Domitian over earlier buildings of Nero.\n\nLater emperors particularly the Severans made significant additions to the buildings.\n\nThe House of Livia, the wife of Augustus, is conventionally attributed to her based only on the generic name on a clay pipe and circumstantial factors such as proximity to the House of Augustus.\n\nThe building is located near the Temple of Magna Mater at the western end of the hill, on a lower terrace from the temple. It is notable for its beautiful frescoes.\n\nThe House of Tiberius is located next to the Temple of Cybele, on the platform built by Nero and in the current Farnese Gardens.\n\nDuring Augustus' reign, an area of the Palatine Hill was roped off for a sort of archaeological expedition, which found fragments of Bronze Age pots and tools. He declared this site the \"original town of Rome.\" Modern archaeology has identified evidence of Bronze Age settlement in the area which predates Rome's founding. There is a museum on the Palatine in which artifacts dating from before the official foundation of the City are displayed. The museum also contains Roman statuary.\n\nAn altar to an unknown deity, once thought to be Aius Locutius, was discovered here in 1820.\n\nIn July 2006, archaeologists announced the discovery of the Palatine House, which they believe to be the birthplace of Rome's first Emperor, Augustus. Head archaeologist Clementina Panella uncovered a section of corridor and other fragments under Rome's Palatine Hill, which she described on July 20 as \"a very ancient aristocratic house.\" The two story house appears to have been built around an atrium, with frescoed walls and mosaic flooring, and is situated on the slope of the Palatine that overlooks the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine. The Republican-era houses on the Palatine were overbuilt by later palaces after the Great Fire of Rome (64), but apparently this one was not; the tempting early inference is that it was preserved for a specific and important reason. On the ground floor, three shops opened onto the Via Sacra.\n\nThe location of the \"domus\" is important because of its potential proximity to the \"Curiae Veteres\", the earliest shrine of the \"curies\" of Rome.\nIn January 2007, Italian archeologist Irene Iacopi announced that she had probably found the legendary Lupercal cave beneath the remains of Augustus' residence, the \"Domus Livia\" (House of Livia) on the Palatine. Archaeologists came across the 16-metre-deep cavity while working to restore the decaying palace. The first photos of the cave show a richly decorated vault encrusted with mosaics and seashells. The Lupercal was probably converted to a sanctuary by Romans in later centuries.\n\nIn November 2007 archaeologists unveiled photographs of the cave. Partially collapsed and decorated with seashells and colored marble, the vaulted sanctuary is buried 16 metres inside the Palatine hill. A white eagle was found atop the sanctuary's vault. Most of the sanctuary is collapsed or filled with earth, but laser scans allowed experts to estimate that the circular structure has a height of 8 metres and a diameter of 7.3 metres.\nAdriano La Regina (former Rome’s archaeological superintendent 1976–2004, professor of Etruscology at Rome’s La Sapienza University), Prof. Fausto Zevi (professor of Roman Archaeology at Rome's La Sapienza University) and Prof. Henner von Hesberg (head of the German Archaeological Institute, Rome) denied the identification of the grotto with Lupercal on topographic and stylistic grounds. They concluded that the grotto is actually a \"nymphaeum\" or underground \"triclinium\" from Neronian times.\n\n\n"}

Today B-72 is commonly being used as an adhesive by conservator-restorers, specifically in the conservation and restoration of ceramic objects and glass objects, and can also be used for labelling museum objects.\n\nB-72 is a durable and non-yellowing acrylic resin, which can be described chemically as an ethyl-methacrylate copolymer. It is soluble in acetone, ethanol, toluene, and xylenes, among other solvents and solvent mixtures.\n\nOne of the major advantages of B-72 as a consolidant is that it is stronger and harder than polyvinyl acetate without being extremely brittle. This adhesive is more flexible than many of the other typically used adhesives and tolerates more stress and strain on a join than most others. The major drawbacks to using B-72 are related to its handling properties: as in the case of other acrylic resins it is difficult to apply as an adhesive and to manipulate with precision.\n\nThe most suitable solvent for B-72 is acetone. However, solvent mixtures with various proportions of acetone, ethanol, and toluene are frequently used to alter the working time of the resin and to produce slightly different properties (hardness and flexibility, e.g.) in the set resin. Unlike cellulose nitrate, B-72 does not need additives like plasticizers to stabilize its durability. Fumed colloidal silica can be added to help with the workability of the resin. Research shows that the silica better distributes the stress and strain that occurs during evaporation of a solvent and during the setting of the adhesive film.\n\nBecause of its transparency and versatility, conservators, led by Stephen Koob of the Corning Museum of Glass, have recently begun to use cast sheets of B-72 as a fill material in glass objects.\n"}
{"id": "171408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171408", "title": "Reduplication", "text": "Reduplication\n\nReduplication in linguistics is a morphological process in which the root or stem of a word (or part of it) or even the whole word is repeated exactly or with a slight change.\n\nReduplication is used in inflections to convey a grammatical function, such as plurality, intensification, etc., and in lexical derivation to create new words. It is often used when a speaker adopts a tone more \"expressive\" or figurative than ordinary speech and is also often, but not exclusively, iconic in meaning. Reduplication is found in a wide range of languages and language groups, though its level of linguistic productivity varies.\n\n\"Reduplication\" is the standard term for this phenomenon in the linguistics literature. Other terms that are occasionally used include \"cloning\", \"doubling\", \"duplication\", \"repetition\", and \"tautonym\" when it is used in biological taxonomies, such as \"Bison bison\".\n\nThe origin of this usage of \"tautonym\" is uncertain, but it has been suggested that it is of relatively recent derivation.\n\nReduplication is often described phonologically in one of two different ways: either (1) as reduplicated \"segments\" (sequences of consonants/vowels) or (2) as reduplicated \"prosodic units\" (syllables or moras). In addition to phonological description, reduplication often needs to be described morphologically as a reduplication of linguistic constituents (i.e. words, stems, roots). As a result, reduplication is interesting theoretically as it involves the interface between phonology and morphology.\n\nThe \"base\" is the word (or part of the word) that is to be copied. The reduplicated element is called the reduplicant, often abbreviated as \"\" or sometimes just \"R\".\n\nIn reduplication, the reduplicant is most often repeated only once. However, in some languages, reduplication can occur more than once, resulting in a tripled form, and not a \"duple\" as in most reduplication. Triplication is the term for this phenomenon of copying two times. Pingelapese has both reduplication and triplication:\n\nTriplication occurs in other languages, e.g. Ewe, Shipibo, Twi, Mokilese, Min Nan (Hokkien), Stau.\n\nSometimes gemination (i.e. the doubling of consonants or vowels) is considered to be a form of reduplication. The term \"dupleme\" has been used (after \"morpheme\") to refer to different types of reduplication that have the same meaning.\n\n\"Full reduplication\" involves a reduplication of the entire word. For example, Kham derives reciprocal forms from reflexive forms by total reduplication:\n\nAnother example is from Musqueam Halkomelem \"dispositional\" aspect formation:\n\n\"Partial reduplication\" involves a reduplication of only part of the word. For example, Marshallese forms words meaning 'to wear X' by reduplicating the last \"consonant-vowel-consonant\" (\"CVC\") sequence of a base, i.e. \"base\"+\"CVC\":\n\nMany languages often use both full and partial reduplication, as in the Motu example below:\n\nReduplication may be \"initial\" (i.e. prefixal), \"final\" (i.e. suffixal), or \"internal\" (i.e. infixal), e.g.\n\nInitial reduplication in Agta \"(CV- prefix)\":\nFinal reduplication in Dakota \"(-CCV suffix)\":\nInternal reduplication in Samoan \"(-CV- infix)\":\nInternal reduplication is much less common than the initial and final types.\n\nA reduplicant can copy from either the left edge of a word (\"left-to-right\" copying) or from the right edge (\"right-to-left\" copying). There is a tendency for prefixing reduplicants to copy left-to-right and for suffixing reduplicants to copy right-to-left:\n\nInitial L → R copying in Oykangand Kunjen (a Pama–Nyungan language of Australia):\nFinal R → L copying in Sirionó:\nCopying from the other direction is possible although less common:\n\nInitial R → L copying in Tillamook:\nFinal L → R copying in Chukchi:\nInternal reduplication can also involve copying the beginning or end of the base. In Quileute, the first consonant of the base is copied and inserted after the first vowel of the base.\n\nInternal L → R copying in Quileute:\nIn Temiar, the last consonant of the root is copied and inserted before the medial consonant of the root.\n\nInternal R → L copying in Temiar (an Austroasiatic language of Malaysia):\nA rare type of reduplication is found in Semai (an Austroasiatic language of Malaysia). \"Expressive minor reduplication\" is formed with an initial reduplicant that copies the first and last segment of the base:\n\nAll of the examples above consist of only reduplication. However, reduplication often occurs with other phonological and morphological process, such as deletion, affixation of non-reduplicating material, etc.\n\nFor instance, in Tz'utujil a new '-ish' adjective form is derived from other words by suffixing the reduplicated first consonant of the base followed by the segment . This can be written succinctly as \"\". Below are some examples:\n\n\nSomali has a similar suffix that is used in forming the plural of some nouns: \"-aC\" (where \"C\" is the last consonant of the base):\n\n\nThis combination of reduplication and affixation is commonly referred to as \"fixed-segment reduplication\".\n\nIn Tohono O'odham initial reduplication also involves gemination of the first consonant in the distributive plural and in repetitive verbs:\n\n\nSometimes gemination can be analyzed as a type of reduplication.\n\n\nIn the Malayo-Polynesian family, reduplication is used to form plurals (among many other functions):\n\nIn pre-1972 Indonesian and Malay orthography, \"2\" was shorthand for the reduplication that forms plurals: \"orang\" \"person\", \"orang-orang\" or \"orang2\" \"people\". This orthography has resurfaced widely in text messaging and other forms of electronic communication.\n\nThe Nama language uses reduplication to increase the force of a verb: \"go\", \"look;\", \"go-go\" \"examine with attention\".\n\nChinese also uses reduplication: \"rén\" for \"person\", \"rénrén\" for \"everybody\". Japanese does it too: \"toki\" \"time\", \"tokidoki\" \"sometimes, from time to time\". Both languages can use a special written iteration mark to indicate reduplication, although in Chinese the iteration mark is no longer used in standard writing and is often found only in calligraphy.\n\nIndo-European languages formerly used reduplication to form a number of verb forms, especially in the preterite or perfect. In the older Indo-European languages, many such verbs survive:\n\n\nThose forms do not survive in Modern English but existed in its parent Germanic languages. Many verbs in the Indo-European languages exhibit reduplication in the present stem, rather than the perfect stem, often with a different vowel from that used for the perfect: Latin \"gigno, genui\" (\"I beget, I begat\") and Greek τίθημι, ἔθηκα, τέθηκα (I place, I placed, I have placed). Other Indo-European verbs used reduplication as a derivational process: compare Latin \"sto\" (\"I stand\") and \"sisto\" (\"I remain\"). All of those Indo-European inherited reduplicating forms are subject to reduction by other phonological laws.\n\nReduplication can be used to refer to the most prototypical instance of a word's meaning. In such a case, it is called contrastive focus reduplication. Finnish colloquial speech uses the process; nouns can be reduplicated to indicate genuinity, completeness, originality and being uncomplicated, as opposed to being fake, incomplete, complicated or fussy. It can be thought as compound word formation. For example, \"Söin jäätelöä ja karkkia, sekä tietysti ruokaruokaa.\" \"I ate ice cream and candy, and of course food-food\". Here, \"food-food\" is contrasted to \"junk-food\". One may say, \"En ollut eilen koulussa, koska olin kipeä. Siis kipeäkipeä\" (\"I wasn't at school yesterday because I was sick. Sick-sick, that is\"); that means that one was actually suffering from an illness instead of making up excuses, as usual.\n\n\nWords can be reduplicated with their case morphemes, as in \"lomalla lomalla\", where the adessive morpheme (-\"-lla\") appears twice. While reduplication is intelligible to most Finns, its usage is confined mostly to subgroups of young women and children (and possibly fathers of young children when they talk to their children). However, most young women and children do not use reduplication. Reduplication has a somewhat childish connotation and may be perceived as annoying.\n\nIn Swiss German, the verbs \"gah\" or \"goh\" \"go\", \"cho\" \"come\", \"la\" or \"lo\" \"let\" and \"aafa\" or \"aafo\" \"begin\" reduplicate when they are combined with other verbs.\n\nIn some Salishan languages, reduplication can mark both diminution and plurality, with one process being applied to each end of the word, as in the following example from Shuswap. Note that the transcriprion is not comparable to the IPA, but the reduplication of both initial and final portions of the root is clear: \"ṣōk!Emē'’n\" 'knife' reduplicated as \"ṣuk!ṣuk!Emen'’me’n\" 'plural small knives' (Haeberlin 1918:159). Reduplication has been found to be a major part of Salish languages.\n\nDuring the period 25–50 weeks after birth, all typically developing infants go through a stage of reduplicated or canonical babbling (Stark 198, Oller, 1980). Canonical babbling is characterized by repetition of identical or nearly identical consonant-vowel combinations, such as 'nanana' or 'didididi'. It appears as a progression of language development as infants experiment with their vocal apparatus and home in on the sounds used in their native language. Canonical/reduplicated babbling also appears at a time when general rhythmic behavior, such as rhythmic hand movements and rhythmic kicking, appear. Canonical babbling is distinguished from earlier syllabic and vocal play, which has less structure.\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European language used partial reduplication of a consonant and \"e\" in many stative aspect verb forms. The perfect or preterite (past) tense of some Ancient Greek, Gothic, and Latin verbs preserves this reduplication:\n\nProto-Indo-European also used reduplication for imperfective aspect. Ancient Greek preserves this reduplication in the present tense of some verbs. Usually, but not always, this is reduplication of a consonant and \"i\", and contrasts with e-reduplication in the perfect:\n\n\nReduplication in nouns was rare, the best example being Proto-Indo-European \"\" 'wheel' (cf. Lithuanian \"kãklas\" 'neck', Sanskrit \"cakrá\" 'wheel'), which doubled *\"kʷel-o-\" (cf. Old Prussian \"kelan\" 'wheel', Welsh \"pel\" 'ball'), itself likely a deverbative of *\"kʷelh₁-\" 'to turn'.\n\nEnglish has several types of reduplication, ranging from informal expressive vocabulary (the first four forms below) to grammatically meaningful forms (the last two below).\n\n\nOnly the last of the above types is productive, meaning that examples of the first three are fixed forms and new forms are not easily accepted.\n\n\nThe double copula is in some cases a type of reduplication, which may be regarded as non-standard or incorrect.\n\nMore can be learned about English reduplication in , , and .\n\nIn addition to having some reduplicated presents and perfects, Latin uses reduplication for some indefinite relative pronouns, such as \"quisque\" \"whoever\" and \"ubiubi\" \"wherever\".\n\n\"Latin jingles\". There are also several complete two-word sentences such as: \n\"Cǒmam cōmam.\" \"I shall tidy my hair.\"\n\nWhile not common in Dutch, reduplication does exist. Most, but not all (e.g., \"pipi\", \"blauwblauw\" (laten), \"taaitaai\" (gingerbread)) reduplications in Dutch are loanwords (e.g., \"koeskoes\", \"bonbon\", (ik hoorde het) \"via via\") or imitative (e.g., \"tamtam\", \"tomtom\"). Another example is a former safe sex campaign slogan in Flanders: \"Eerst bla-bla, dan boem-boem\" (\"First talk, then have sex\"; lit. \"First blah-blah, then boom-boom\"). In Dutch the verb \"gaan\" (\"to go\") can be used as an auxiliary verb, which can lead to a triplication: \"we gaan (eens) gaan gaan\" (we are going to get going). The use of \"gaan\" as an auxiliary verb with itself is considered incorrect, but is commonly used in Flanders. Numerous examples of reduplication in Dutch (and other languages) are discussed by Daniëls (2000).\n\nAfrikaans makes use of reduplication to emphasize the meaning of the word repeated and to denote a plural or event happening in more than one place. For example, \"krap\" means \"to scratch one's self,\" while \"krap-krap-krap\" means \"to scratch one's self vigorously\", whereas \"dit het plek-plek gereën\", means \"it rained here and there\". Reduplication in Afrikaans has been described extensively in the literature – see for example , and . Further examples of this include: \"koes\" (to dodge) being reduplicated in the sentence \"Piet hardloop koes-koes weg\" (Piet is running away while constantly dodging / cringing); \"sukkel\" (to struggle) becoming \"sukkel-sukkel\" (making slow progress; struggling on); and \"kierang\" (to cheat) becoming \"kierang-kierang\" to indicate being cheated on repeatedly.\n\nIn Italian reduplication was used both to create new words or word associations (\"tran-tran\", \"via via\", \"leccalecca\") and to intensify the meaning (\"piano piano\" \"very slowly\").\n\nCommon in Lingua Franca, particularly but not exclusively for onomatopoeic action descriptions:\n\"Spagnoli venir...boum boum...andar; Inglis venir...boum boum bezef...andar; Francés venir...tru tru tru...chapar.\" (\"The Spaniards came, cannonaded, and left. The English came, cannonaded heavily, and left. The French came, trumpeted on bugles, and captured it.\")\n\nCommon uses for reduplication in French are the creation of hypocoristics for names, whereby \"Louise\" becomes \"Loulou\", and Zinedine Zidane becomes \"Zizou\"; and in many nursery words, like \"dada\" 'horsie' (vs. \"cheval\" 'horse'), \"tati\" 'auntie' (vs. \"tante\" 'aunt'), or \"tonton\" 'unkie' (vs. \"oncle\" 'uncle').\n\nIn Romanian and Catalan, reduplication is not uncommon and it has been used for both the creation of new words (including many from onomatopoeia) and expressions, for example,\n\nIn colloquial Mexican Spanish it is common to use reduplicated adverbs such as \"luego luego\" (after after) meaning \"immediately\", or \"casi casi\" (almost almost) which intensifies the meaning of 'almost'.\n\nThe reduplication in the Russian language serves for various kinds of intensifying of the meaning and exists in several forms: a hyphenated or repeated word (either exact or inflected reduplication), and forms similar to shm-reduplication.\n\nReduplication is a common feature of Irish and includes the examples \"rírá\", \"ruaille buaille\" both meaning 'commotion' and \"fite fuaite\" meaning 'intertwined'.\n\nReduplication is a very common practice in Persian, to the extent that there are jokes about it. Mainly due to the mixed nature of the Persian language, most of the reduplication comes in the form of a phrase consisting of a Persian word -va- ( = and) and an Arabic word, like \"Taghdir-Maghdir\" (). Reduplication is particularly common in the city of Shiraz in southwestern Iran. One can further categorize the reduplicative words into \"True\" and \"Quasi\" ones. In true reduplicative words, both words are actually real words and have meaning in the language in which it is used. In quasi-reduplicative words, at least one of the words does not have a meaning. Some examples of true reduplicative words in Persian are: \"Xert-o-Pert\" ( = Odds and ends); \"Čert-o-Pert\" ( = Nonsense); \"Čarand-[o-]Parand\" ( = Nonsense); \"Āb-o-Tāb\" ( = much detail). Among the quasi-reduplicative words are \"Zan-[o-]man\" ( = wife); \"Da'vā-Ma'vā\" ( = Argument); \"Talā-malā\" ( = jewelry); and \"Raxt-o-Paxt\" ( = Items of clothing). Reduplication in Persian is sometimes a mockery of words with non-Persian origins.\n\nTypically all Indo-Aryan languages, like Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati and Bengali use partial or echoic reduplication in some form or the other. It is usually used to sound casual, or in a suggestive manner. It is often used to mean \"etcetera\". For example, in Hindi, chai-shai (\"chai\" means tea, while this phrase means tea or any other supplementary drink or tea along with snacks). Quite common in casual conversations are a few more examples like shopping-wopping, khana-wana.\nReduplication is also used in Dravidian languages like Telugu for the same purpose.\nSouth Asian languages are also rich in other forms of reduplication: morphological (expressives), lexical (distributives), and phrasal (aspectual).\n\nReduplication also occurs in the 3th gaṇa (verb class) of the Sanskrit language: \"bibheti\" \"he fears\", \"bibharti\" \"he bears\", \"juhoti\" \"he offers\", \"dadāti\", \"he gives\". Even though the general idea is to reduplicate the verb root as a prefix, several sandhi rules change the final outcome.\n\nA number of Nepalese nouns are formed by reduplication. As in other languages, the meaning is not that of a true plural, but collectives that refer to a set of the same or related objects, often in a particular situation.\n\nFor example, \"rangi changi\" describes an object that is extremely or vividly colorful, like a crazy mix of colors and/or patterns, perhaps dizzying to the eye. The phrase \"hina mina\" means \"scattered,\" like a large collection of objects spilled (or scampering, as in small animals) in all different directions. The basic Nepalese word for food, \"khana\" becomes \"khana sana\" to refer to the broad generality of anything served at a meal. Likewise, \"chiya\" or tea (conventionally made with milk and sugar) becomes \"chiya siya\": tea and snacks (such as biscuits or cookies). (Please note, these examples of Nepalese words are spelled with a simplified Latin transliteration only, not as exact spellings.)\n\nIn Turkish there are two kinds of reduplication:\n\n\nAs described earlier, contrastive lexical reduplication is used in colloquial Finnish speech. Another type of reduplication occurs in Standard Finnish; reduplication as an intensifier. Common examples of this include \"suurensuuri\" (big-GEN big-NOM) literally \"big of big(ness)\", \"pienenpieni\" (small-GEN small-NOM) literally \"small of small(ness)\", \"hienonhieno\" (fine-GEN fine-NOM). The last example, literally \"fine of fine(ness),\" roughly means \"very fine\". Other adjectives may sometimes be duplicated as well, where a superlative is too strong an expression, somewhat similarly to Slavic languages. This construction can be ambiguous because of its use of a genitive noun followed by a nominative noun, which is not unique to reduplication. For instance the reduplicated form \"suurensuuri jalka\" (big foot of bigness) sounds the same as \"suuren suuri jalka\" (big foot of someone big).\n\nReduplication is usually rhyming. It can add emphasis: 'pici' (tiny) -> ici-pici (very tiny) and it can modify meaning: 'néha-néha' ('seldom-seldom': seldom but repeatedly), 'erre-arra' ('this way-that way', meaning movement without a definite direction), 'ezt-azt' ('this-that', meaning 'all sort of things'), Reduplication often evokes a sense of playfulness and it's quite common when talking to small children.\n\nReduplication is a common phenomenon in Bantu languages and is usually used to form a frequentive verb or for emphasis.\nPopular names that have reduplication include\n\nSemitic languages frequently reduplicate consonants, though often not the vowels that appear next to the consonants in some verb form. This can take the shape of reduplicating the antepenultimate consonant (usually the second of three), the last of two consonants, or the last two consonants.\n\nIn the Hebrew, reduplication is used in nouns and adjectives. For stress, as in (le-aht le-aht) where the adverb 'slowly' – is duplicated to mean very slowly. In a new slang expression, (Gever Gever), the noun 'man' – is duplicated to mean a manly man, a man among man.\n\nMeaning each and every, one by one, as in (yom yom) where the noun 'day' is duplicated to every day, day in day out, day by day.\n\nSome nouns and adjectives can also be made into diminutives by reduplication of the last two consonants (biconsonantal reduplication), e.g.\n\nReduplication in Hebrew is also productive for the creation of verbs, by reduplicating the root or part of it e.g.:\n\ndal () 'poor, spare' > dilel () 'to dilute' but also dildel () 'to impoverish, to weaken';\nnad () 'to move, to nod' > nadad () 'to wander' but also nidned () 'to swing, to nag'.\n\nIn Amharic, verb roots can be reduplicated three different ways. These can result in verbs, nouns, or adjectives (which are often derived from verbs).\n\nFrom the root \"sbr\" 'break', antepenultimate reduplication produces \"täsäbabbärä\" 'it was shattered' and biconsonantal reduplication produces \"täsbäräbbärä\" 'it was shattered repeatedly' and \"səbərbari\" 'a shard, a shattered piece'.\n\nFrom the root \"kHb\" 'pile stones into a wall', since the second radical is not fully specified, what some call \"hollow\", the antepenultimate reduplication process reduplicates the \"k\" inserting the vowel \"a\" along with the consonant as a place holder for the hollow consonant, which is by some criteria antepenultimate, and produces \"akakabä\" 'pile stones repeatedly'.\n\nIn Burmese, reduplication is used in verbs and adjectives to form adverbs. Many Burmese words, especially adjectives such as ('beautiful' ), which consist of two syllables (when reduplicated, each syllable is reduplicated separately), when reduplicated ( → 'beautifully' ) become adverbs. This is also true of many Burmese verbs, which become adverbs when reduplicated.\n\nSome nouns are also reduplicated to indicate plurality. For instance, , means \"country,\" but when reduplicated to , it means \"many countries\" (as in , \"international\"). Another example is , which means \"kinds,\" but the reduplicated form means \"multiple kinds.\"\n\nA few measure words can also be reduplicated to indicate \"one or the other\":\n\nAdjective reduplication is common in Standard Chinese, typically denoting emphasis, less acute degree of the quality described, or an attempt at more indirect speech: \" xiǎoxiǎo de\" 小小的 (small, tiny), \"chòuchòu de\" 臭臭的 (smelly). Reduplication can also reflect a \"cute\", juvenile or informal register; in this respect, it can be compared to the English diminutive ending \"-y\" or \"-ie\" (tiny, smelly, 狗狗 \"doggie\", etc.)\n\nIn the case of adjectives composed of two characters (morphemes), generally each of the two characters is reduplicated separately: \"piàoliang\" 漂亮 (beautiful) reduplicates as \"piàopiàoliangliang\" 漂漂亮亮.\n\nVerb reduplication is also common in Standard Chinese, conveying the meaning of informal and temporary character of the action. It is often used in imperative expressions, in which it lessens the degree of imperativity: \"zuòzuò\" 坐坐 (sit (for a while)), \" děngděng\" 等等 (wait (for a while)). Compound verbs are reduplicated as a whole word: \"xiūxixiūxi\" 休息休息 (rest (for a while)). This can be analyzed as an instance of omission of \"一\" (originally, e.g., \"坐一坐\" or \"等一等\" ) or \"一下\" (originally, e.g., \"坐一下\").\n\nNoun reduplication, though nearly absent in Standard Chinese, is found in the southwestern dialect of Mandarin. For instance, in Sichuan Mandarin, \"bāobāo\" 包包 (handbag) is used whereas Beijing use \"bāor\" 包儿. One notable exception is the colloquial use of \"bāobāo\" 包包 by non-Sichuanese speakers to denote a perceived fancy, attractive, or \"cute\" purse (somewhat equivalent to the English \"baggie\"). However, there are few nouns that can be reduplicated in Standard Chinese, and reduplication denotes generalisation and uniformity: \"rén\" 人 (human being) and \"rénrén\" 人人 (everybody (in general, in common)), \"jiājiāhùhù\" 家家户户 (every household (uniformly)) – in the latter \"jiā\" and \"hù\" additionally duplicate the meaning of \"household\", which is a common way of creating compound words in Chinese.\n\nA small number of native Japanese nouns have collective forms produced by reduplication (possibly with rendaku), such as 人々 \"hitobito\" \"people\" (\"h\" → \"b\" is rendaku) – these are written with the iteration mark \"々\" to indicate duplication. This formation is not productive and is limited to a small set of nouns. Similarly to Standard Chinese, the meaning is not that of a true plural, but collectives that refer to a large, given set of the same object; for example, the formal English equivalent of 人々 would be \"people\" (collective), rather than \"persons\" (plural individuals).\n\nJapanese also contains a large number of mimetic words formed by reduplication of a syllable. These words include not only onomatopoeia, but also words intended to invoke non-auditory senses or psychological states, such as きらきら \"kirakira\" (sparkling or shining). By one count, approximately 43% of Japanese mimetic words are formed by full reduplication, and many others are formed by partial reduplication, as in がささ〜 \"ga-sa-sa-\" (rustling) – compare English \"\"a\"-ha-ha-ha\".\n\nWords called từ láy are found abundantly in Vietnamese. They are formed by repeating a part of a word to form new words, altering the meaning of the original word. Its effect is to sometimes either increase or decrease the intensity of the adjective, or to generalize a word's meaning. It is often used as a literary device (like alliteration) in poetry and other compositions but is also prevalent in everyday speech. In some cases, the word's tone may be reduplicated in addition to an initial or final sound (see tone sandhi).\n\nExamples of reduplication increasing intensity:\n\nExamples of reduplication decreasing intensity:\n\nExamples of generalization:\n\nExamples of blunt sounds or physical conditions:\n\nExamples of emphasis without a change in meaning:\n\nIn colloquial speech, almost any arbitrary word can be reduplicated to express a dismissive attitude:\n\nAs seen above, disyllabic words undergo a complex transformation: <first syllable> <left edge of second syllable plus a vowel> <first syllable> <second syllable>.\n\nKhmer uses reduplication for several purposes, including emphasis and pluralization. The Khmer script includes a reduplication sign, , indicating that the word or phrase preceding it is to be pronounced twice. Reduplication in Khmer, like many Mon–Khmer languages, can express complex thoughts. Khmer also uses a form of reduplication known as \"synonym compounding\", in which two phonologically distinct words with similar or identical meanings are combined, either to form the same term or to form a new term altogether.\n\nThe wide use of reduplication is certainly one of the most prominent grammatical features of Malay (as well as of other South-East Asian and Austronesian languages).\n\nIn Malay language, reduplication is a very productive process. It is used for expression of various grammatical functions (such as verbal aspect) and it is part in a number of complex morphological models. Simple reduplication of nouns and pronouns can express at least three meanings:\n\n\nReduplication of an adjective can express different things:\n\nReduplication of a verb can express various things:\nNotice that in the first case, the nasalisation of the initial consonant (whereby /p/ becomes /m/) is repeated, while in the second case, it only applies in the repeated word.\n\nIn Tagalog, an Austronesian language spoken in the Philippines, upon which the national language \"Filipino\" is based, reduplication is employed productively in multiple parts of speech.\nReduplication of the root, prefix or infix is employed to convey different grammatical aspects in verbs. In \"Mag- verbs\" reduplication of the root after the prefix \"mag-\" or \"nag-\" changes the verb from the infinitive form, or perfective aspect, respectively, to the contemplated or imperfective aspect. Thus:\n\nFor Ergative verbs (frequently referred to as \"object focus\" verbs) reduplication of part the infix and the stem occur:\n\nAdjectives and adverbs employ morphological reduplication for many different reasons such as plurality agreement when the adjective modifies a plural noun, intensification of the adjective or adverb, and sometimes because the prefix forces the adjective to have a reduplicated stem\".\n\nAgreement (optional, plurality, and agreement with a plural noun, is entirely optional in Tagalog (e.g. a plural noun does not have to have a plural article marking it\":\n\nThe entire adjective is repeated for intensification of adjectives or adverbs:\n\nThe complete superlative prefix pagka- demands reduplication of the first syllable of the adjective's stem:\n\nReduplication of nouns happens in Tagalog, but is far less productive, and more sporadic. Examples of such nouns formed by reduplication are \"halo-halo\" \"ice cream\" (lit. \"mix mix\") and \"tago-tago\" \"refugee or even illegal immigrant (lit. \"latent-latent\").\n\nIn Tetum, reduplication is used to turn adjectives into superlatives.\n\nPingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. Pingelapese utilizes both duplication and triplication of a verb or part of a verb to express that something is happening for certain duration of time. No reduplication means that something happens. A reduplicated verb means that something IS happening, and a triplication means that something is STILL happening. For example, \"saeng\" means 'to cry' in Pingelapese. When reduplicated and triplicated, the duration of this verb is changed:\n\nFew languages employ triplication in their language. In Micronesia, Pingelapese is one of only two languages that uses triplication, the other being Mokilese. Reduplication and triplication are not to be confused with tense however. In order to make a phrase past, present, or future tense, a temporal phrase must be used.\n\nThe Māori language (New Zealand) uses reduplication in a number of ways.\n\nReduplication can convey a simple plural meaning, for instance \"wahine\" \"woman\", \"waahine\" \"women\", \"tangata\" \"person\", \"taangata\" \"people\". Biggs calls this \"infixed reduplication\". It occurs in a small subset of \"people\" words in most Polynesian languages.\n\nReduplication can convey emphasis or repetition, for example \"mate\" \"die\", \"matemate\" \"die in numbers\"; and de-emphasis, for example \"wera\" \"hot\" and \"werawera\" \"warm\".\n\nReduplication can also extend the meaning of a word; for instance \"paki\" \"pat\" becomes \"papaki\" \"slap or clap once\" and \"pakipaki\" \"applaud\"; \"kimo\" \"blink\" becomes \"kikimo\" \"close eyes firmly\"\n\nRapa is the French Polynesian language of the island of Rapa Iti. In terms of reduplication, the indigenous language known as Old Rapa uses reduplication consistent to other Polynesian languages. Reduplication of Old Rapa occurs in four ways: full, rightward, leftward, and medial. Full and rightward are generally more frequently used as opposed to the leftward and medial. Leftward and medial only occur as CV reduplication and partial leftward and medial usually denote emphasis.\n\nExample of Reduplication Forms:\nFor the Rapa Language the implementation of reduplication has specific implications. The most evident of these are known as iterative, intensification, specification, diminutive, metaphorical, nominalizing, and adjectival.\n\nIterative:\n\n\nIntensification:\n\n\nSpecification:\n\n\nDiminutive:\n\n\nMetaphorical (typically comparing an animal action with a human action):\n\n\nNominalizing:\n\n\nAdjectival:\n\n\nReduplication is not a productive noun derivation process in Wuvulu-Aua as it is in other Austronesian languages. Some nouns exhibit reduplication, though they are considered to be fossilized.\n\nVerb roots can undergo whole or partial reduplication to mark aspect. Actions that are continuous are indicated by a reduplicated initial syllable. A whole reduplication can also be used to indicate imperfective aspect.\n\nThe onomatopoeia in Wuvulu language also uses reduplication to describe the sound. These onomatopoeic words can be used as alienable nouns. \n\nThe Mortlockese language is a Micronesian language spoken primarily on the Mortlock Islands. In the Mortlockese language, reduplication is used to show a habitual or imperfective aspect. For example, /jææjæ/ means \"to use something\" while the word /jæjjææjæ/ means \"to use something habitually or repeatedly\". Reduplication is also used in the Mortlockese Language to show extremity or extreme measures. One example of this can be seen in /ŋiimw alɛɛtɛj/ which means \"hate him, her, or it\". To mean \"really hate him, her, or it,\" the phrase changes to /ŋii~mw al~mw alɛɛtɛj/.\n\nReduplication is common in many Australian place names due to their Aboriginal origins. Some examples include Turramurra, Parramatta, Woolloomooloo. In the language of the Wiradjuri people of southeastern Australia, plurals are formed by doubling a word, hence 'Wagga' meaning crow becomes Wagga Wagga meaning 'place of many crows'. This occurs in other place names deriving from the Wiradjuri language including Gumly Gumly, Grong Grong and Book Book.\n\n\nCitations\n\n"}
{"id": "29124969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29124969", "title": "Simalungun people", "text": "Simalungun people\n\nThe Simalungun people are an ethnic group in North Sumatra, considered one of the Batak peoples. Simalungun people live mostly in Simalungun Regency and the surrounding areas, including the city of Pematang Siantar, an autonomous city, but previously part of Simalungun Regency. The regent of Simalungun is JR Saragih.\n\nThe Simalungun live in the 'Eastern Batak' lands, bordering the lands of the Batak Toba to the south and west, and the Batak Karo to the north. The Simalungun are considered to have more in common with their Karo than Toba neighbours, both groups having migrated from Toba and Pakpak in order to participate in trade.\n\nThe Simalungun language is still spoken by many Simalungun people, in addition to Indonesian.\n\nLong before Dutch colonialism was established in North-East Sumatra, people now known collectively as Batak Timur (Eastern Batak) claimed the area as their original homeland, for example Sin Raya (Raya's peoples), Sin Silou (Silou's peoples), Sin Bandar (Bandar's peoples), and so forth. Dutch colonialism was first established in the Malay area of Deli (Medan) under \"De Vide et impera\" (the concept of Dutch political colonialism). The Batak Timur people were ruled by raja (kings), considered to be living gods. One by one their kingdoms capitulated to Dutch aggression and expansionism. The Dutch then gave a collective name to their new colonial area of the Eastern Batak kingdoms, that name being Simeloengoen. With the current Indonesian orthography the name Simalungun is still used today, even among Eastern Batak people themselves.\n\nThe Simalungun people were ruled by \"raja\" (kings), considered to be living gods. G.L. Tichelman (1893–1962), a Dutch researcher, described Simalungun villages as consisting of houses built parallel to rivers from wooden poles and palm leaves. Houses could accommodate a single family (\"rumah parsatanggaan\"), or as many as twelve (\"rumah parrumahopattanggaan\") with a designated area for each family within. The head of the village lived in the 'Rumah Bolon', the village's largest, most ornate house. The Head of Village was installed by, and loyal to The King. The main village or capital of each Kingdom were called 'Pematang.'\nVillagers drove out spirits from the village by holding 'Robu Tabu', days on which the village would be decorated and outsiders excluded from the village.\n\nVillages would bathe in a communal 'tapian', with water piped through bamboo tubes for bathing. The Simalungun also used bamboo tubes for carrying water back to the village. Religious ceremonies would often be held near the Tapian. 'Parsihili' were statues used to take an illness away from a person, while 'Pasiarhon' were statues used for communing with the dead. Although villagers would support victims of house fires, it was considered unlucky to offer them shelter for fear of further fires, and instead a new house would be constructed communally as soon as possible.\n\nIt was considered inappropriate to bargain with family members, so an intermediary would be used when purchasing items from family. Courtship was arranged in the marketplace using a betel nut. Girls wishing to avoid attention would give the nut to an old man, who would look after her during market day, or would wear a hiou, to suggest unavailability.\n\nThe pounding of rice was an important activity, and the communal 'Losung', or riceblock, was used for this activity, with a hole allocated for each family to use. A new losung would be cut from a tree trunk, and on an auspicious day decorated with flowers and transported into the village accompanied by music. A boy and girl dressed in ceremonial clothes would invest the new riceblock by throwing rice over it, and the villagers would sing songs.\n\nThe birth of a child was an auspicious occasion, and the \"dukun\" (midwife/witch doctor) was appointed to drive off spirits, and to cut the umbilical cord with a bamboo knife. The newborn baby would be swaddled and daubed with rice chewed by the \"dukun\" prior to the mother commencing breastfeeding. The placenta would be buried under the house and for seven nights a fire would be maintained to drive off spirits.\n\nOn the seventh day the child would be brought to the tapian. If the date of birth was an auspicious one, this would be done using by the mother a new hiou, a ragi idup or ragi panei, but if the date was a bad one, the baby would be carefully brought by all the women of the village, who would set out to deceive the evil spirits in order to protect the baby. When the child was named, it would be given black, white and red bracelets for protective purposes.\n\nA well-preserved traditional Simalungun village can be seen at Pematang Purba.\n\nThe concept of a cohesive Simalungun people is derived in part from Dutch colonialism. In 1870 the Dutch established the Residency of East Sumatra, centred on Medan in the Kingdom of Deli. In 1904 the Netherlands East Indies government signed surrender agreements with the seven kingdoms of the 'Simeloengoenlanden', in order to form the administrative of unit Simeloengoen en Karolanden. These seven Simalungun kingdoms were the kingdoms of Siantar, Tanoh Jawa, Panei, Dolok Silou, Raya, Purba and Silimahuta. It has been suggested that Tanoh Jawa had more in common with early pagan Asahan (later to become the Asahan Sultanate) than it did with the other Simalungun kingdoms.\n\nThe colonial seat was established in 1908 at Pematang Siantar. The Dutch colonial system encouraged migration, especially of Javanese and Tobanese labourers working on Dutch plantations, with both peoples bringing new influences to the area, which tended to cause the original people of Simalungun to be intimidated and marginalized. After World War II, in 1946, a social revolution occurred in East Sumatra which is viewed as a tragedy by the Simalungun people. Non-native settlers in East Sumatra demanded changes to the monarchy systems of Deli, Karo and Simalungun, and agitated for unity with the Javanese government which had been proclaimed as the Republic Of Indonesia in August, 1945. Many were kidnapped and killed, especially from the royal families of each Kingdom. The monarchy system in East Sumatra was deposed and, while the families are still intact and acknowledged by the Simalungun people as such among themselves, the titles are now entirely ceremonial within the Simalungun cultures.\n\nAugust Theis, a German missionary arrived in Sumatra in 1902. He was subject to Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen, who instructed him to head to the Simalungun region. They arrived on 2 September 1903, a day now commemorated by the Simalungun church. Theis opened several schools, and returned to the Netherlands in 1921.\n\nThe first translation of The Bible into an indigenous Indonesian language was by Wismar Djaulung Saragih Sumbayak, who had been baptised by Theis in 1910. Wismar also authored the first Simalungun dictionary, and successfully campaigned for teaching in schools to be conducted in Simalungun rather than Toba. He also pushed for the use of traditional Simalungun clothes and music in the church. His efforts eventually led to the formation of the distinct Simalungun Protestant Christian Church.\n\nSimalungun people belong to one of four surnames (clans). Each surname has sub-surnames, although individuals may choose to identify primarily by their surnames, rather than sub-surnames, in order to emphasize common kinship.\n\nThe four original surnames are:-\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1826771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1826771", "title": "Slam Dunk Contest", "text": "Slam Dunk Contest\n\nThe NBA Slam Dunk Contest (officially known as the Verizon Slam Dunk for sponsorship reasons) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) competition held during the NBA All-Star Weekend. The contest was inaugurated by the American Basketball Association (ABA) at its All-Star Game in 1976 in Denver, the same year the slam dunk was legalized in the NCAA. As a result of the ABA–NBA merger later that year there would not be another slam dunk contest at the professional level until 1984. The contest has adopted several formats over the years, including, until 2014, the use of fan voting, via text-messaging, to determine the winner of the final round.\n\nThe very first slam dunk contest was won by Larry Nance Sr. of the Suns at the 1984 NBA All-Star Game. The current champion of the NBA Dunk Contest is Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz.\n\nOn January 27, 1976 at McNichols Sports Arena during halftime of the 1976 ABA All Star Game the first-ever Slam Dunk Contest was held, which was won by Julius Erving of the New York Nets over David Thompson of the Denver Nuggets, Artis Gilmore of the Kentucky Colonels, and George Gervin and Larry Kenon of the San Antonio Spurs. There was a format each competitor had to follow in which they must attempt 5 dunks in a row under two minutes. One from a standing position, one from a distance of ten feet away from the basket (which is basically the bottom of the semi circle that surrounds the free throw line in the Key. The next 3 were freestyle positions, one coming in from the left side of the basket, one coming in from the right side of the basket and finally from either corner down the baseline to the basket. They were judged on artistic ability, imagination, body flow as well as fan response.\n\nArtis Gilmore went first followed by George Gervin, Larry Kenon, David Thompson and finally Julius Erving. George Gervin and David Thompson both missed a dunk during their routines which counted as a zero (scores were not announced to the audience). David Thompson did a 360 degree dunk to finish his routine. All competitors had to perform a dunk from 10 feet, but Julius Erving started marking his steps from the free throw line (15 feet away). He then completed a dunk from the free throw line.\n\nThis was a season long event similar to 1977–1978 NBA Horse event. There were 22 competitors throughout the event (nearly one for each team at the time), including future Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, David Thompson, Alex English, Moses Malone, George Gervin, and Elvin Hayes and took place in multiple venues throughout the season. Darnell Hillman was named the winner that season, beating out the Golden State Warriors' Larry McNeill in the championship round on June 5, 1977 in Portland.\n\nThe NBA reintroduced the Slam Dunk Contest in 1984 at its birthplace in Denver. Phoenix's Larry Nance defeated the original Dunk contest winner Julius Erving in the final round. Dominique Wilkins won the contest the following year, but in 1986 his Atlanta Hawks teammate Spud Webb made history when he defeated Wilkins in the final, preventing him from retaining his title. Standing a mere 5 feet 7 inches tall, Webb became the shortest player ever to win the contest, a distinction that he still holds. Chicago's Michael Jordan won back-to-back dunk contest victories in 1987 and in 1988. His victory over Wilkins in 1988 in Chicago finished with a perfect 50 dunk from the free-throw line for his third dunk to win the contest. However, the announcers did note that Wilkins was given abnormally low score for his breathtaking third dunk, a 45, allowing Jordan to win it by 2 with his perfect 50. To this day, the allegations of \"home cooking\" still float around surrounding the event (it was held on Jordan's home court; one of the judges was former Chicago Bears star Gale Sayers; and another judge, former NBA star Tom Hawkins, is a Chicago native) and is considered arguably the most controversial of the slam dunk competitions. The following year in Houston, New York's Kenny \"Sky\" Walker, a last-minute replacement whose father died just days beforehand, upset Portland's Clyde Drexler, the hometown favorite and Houston native who was seen as the favorite, being that Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins were not competing. 1986 champ Spud Webb finished 3rd, while Shelton Jones finished 4th. Though Jordan & Wilkins still played in the All-Star Game, Jordan chose not to compete due to a minor injury, and Wilkins did not compete in the competition due to a hand injury.\n\nIn 1990, Dominique Wilkins of the Atlanta Hawks edged out Kenny Smith of the Sacramento Kings to win his second Slam Dunk Contest (first won in 1985 over Michael Jordan). Kenny Smith scored high points for originality with his signature dunk – he started by turning his back to the basket, bouncing the ball backward between his legs and off the backboard, then turning and grabbing it in the air and reverse dunking it. After 1990, interest in the Slam Dunk Contest began to wane and lasted throughout the 1990s. Initially, it was because many players lost interest in competing; some cited concerns of injuries, while others felt that the full repertoire of humanly possible dunks had already been exhausted. With most of the superstars – Jordan, Wilkins, Drexler, etc. – choosing not to participate, lesser-known players began to compete, leading to either watered-down competitions or surprises. Fans complained that players were beginning to win contests with boring or unoriginal dunks (witness the relatively forgettable early-'90s wins by the likes of Cedric Ceballos and Brent Barry). Harold Miner was a standout in 1993, winning the contest with a reverse power dunk, reaching between his legs and down to his feet in mid-air before sending the ball down. In 1994 and 1997 respectively, Isaiah Rider and Kobe Bryant won the contest. Rider would win with a spectacular, between-the-legs dunk, reminiscent of the Orlando Woolridge effort in the 1984 contest, but wasn't able to repeat in 1995, missing the same dunk on several tries, opening the way for Miner to grab his second slam dunk title in three years. In 1998, the Slam Dunk Contest was replaced with the WNBA-NBA 2Ball Contest. In 1999, there was no All-Star Game due to the NBA lockout.\n\nAfter a one-All Star Weekend layoff (the NBA did not have an All Star Weekend during the labor-shortened 1999 season), the NBA decided to bring the Slam Dunk Contest back for the 2000 All-Star Weekend in Oakland, California. It would prove to be one of the most electrifying dunk contests in the league's history, featuring a great showdown between eventual winner Vince Carter of the Toronto Raptors, his cousin and then-teammate Tracy McGrady, and the Houston Rockets' Steve Francis. Carter won after performing a number of very impressive dunks, including two reverse 360 windmills, a honey dip, and a between-the-legs dunk off a bounced alley-oop from McGrady. The next four contests did not feature superstars like Carter and Bryant, and despite innovative efforts by the likes of Desmond Mason and Jason Richardson, the lack of A-list superstars willing to participate hurt the appeal of the contest.\n\nIn 2005, the Slam Dunk Contest returned to its birthplace in Denver. With the spectacular dunks of prior contests, there was buzz that the dunk competition could regain the popularity it had in the 1980s. The Phoenix Suns' Amar'e Stoudemire alley-ooping 360 off a soccer-style header from teammate Steve Nash; J. R. Smith putting it around his back and dunking, and the new champion, Josh Smith alley-ooping over Kenyon Martin all wowed the crowd with their maneuvers. With the change in the rules requiring an additional teammate starting in the second round, they proved there were indeed many ways to dunk a basketball that had not been done before. Amar'e Stoudemire received rave reviews, as did Smith when he did a tribute dunk to Dominique Wilkins while donning Wilkins' jersey.\n\nAgain in 2006, the Dunk Contest in Houston revitalized the interests of audiences as 5'9\" Nate Robinson of the New York Knicks took the title with a great dunk-off. One of his most exciting dunks was a high-flying dunk over former Slam Dunk Contest winner, 5'7\" Spud Webb. The 2006 Slam Dunk Contest was also the first Dunk Contest in history to have a \"Dunk Off\", the equivalent to a Dunk Contest overtime, between Knicks point guard Nate Robinson and shooting guard Andre Iguodala of the Philadelphia 76ers. Many fans argue that Iguodala should have won the contest, as it took Robinson fourteen attempts before finally completing his dunk. Iguodala pulled off a dunk where he started out of bounds from the right side of the baseline while teammate Allen Iverson bounced the ball off the back of the right side of the backboard. Iguodala caught the ball in mid-air behind the backboard, spun around to the other side while ducking his head (to avoid colliding with the backboard) and dunked it with his right hand.\n\nOn February 17, 2007, the contest was held in Las Vegas. Judges for the event were all past winners: Michael Jordan, Dominique Wilkins, Kobe Bryant, Julius Erving, and Vince Carter. The title was taken by the Boston Celtics' Gerald Green, who, among other dunks, jumped over reigning champ Nate Robinson while covering his face – a homage to 1991 winner, Dee Brown, whose jersey Green had worn. He also scored a perfect fifty with his last slam, a windmill over a table. Other noteworthy dunks include a dunk by Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard, who, while making his dunk, stuck a sticker with his smiling face on the backboard a reported 12'6\" from the ground, two and a half feet beyond the regulation NBA rim.\n\nOn February 16, 2008, the contest was held in New Orleans. Judges for the event included Darryl Dawkins, Dominique Wilkins, Karl Malone, Julius Erving, and Magic Johnson. The title was taken by Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard. Howard's most noteworthy dunk came during the first round, his second dunk overall, when he took off his jersey to reveal a Superman shirt and cape. With teammate Jameer Nelson's assistance he would make a leaping dunk from just in front of the free-throw line after a running start, throwing the ball through the rim from a few feet away. Other noteworthy dunks included the first round slam by Jamario Moon while the previous year's winner, Gerald Green, relied heavily on theatrics by blowing out a cupcake with a birthday candle on the rim before dunking (a jam he termed \"The Birthday Cake\"). For the first time ever, fan voting determined the outcome of the final round of the contest; Howard beat Green for the trophy by claiming 78% of the fans' votes.\n\nNate Robinson won the 2009 contest on February 14 in Phoenix, Arizona. The 5'9\" guard dressed all in green as \"Krypto-Nate\" (a portmanteau of 'Nate' and Kryptonite) and jumped over 6'11\" Dwight Howard characterized as Superman. He defeated Howard in the finals by a fan vote of 52–48 percent. J. R. Smith and Rudy Fernández also competed.\n\nNate Robinson won the 2010 contest on February 13 in Dallas, becoming the first 3-time Slam Dunk champion. Robinson took on Shannon Brown of the Los Angeles Lakers, Gerald Wallace of the Charlotte Bobcats, and DeMar DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors. DeRozan earned his spot in the competition by defeating Los Angeles Clippers guard Eric Gordon in the inaugural Sprite Slam Dunk-In held the night before the actual dunk contest. Robinson and DeRozan advanced to the final round, where Robinson's double-pump reverse dunk helped seal a 51% to 49% victory.\n\nBlake Griffin won the 2011 slam dunk contest by jumping and dunking over the hood of a Kia sedan on February 19 in Los Angeles. JaVale McGee of the Washington Wizards, DeMar DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors, and Serge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City Thunder all competed against Griffin. Griffin and McGee advanced to the final round, where Griffin stole the show, winning the contest with 68% of the vote.\n\nJeremy Evans won the 2012 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest by performing a dunk over Kevin Hart on February 25 in Orlando, Florida with 29% of the votes. Joining Evans were Chase Budinger of the Houston Rockets, Paul George of the Indiana Pacers, and Derrick Williams of the Minnesota Timberwolves. While George awed the crowd with a dunk with the lights turned off, Evans had perhaps the dunk of the contest by jumping teammate Gordon Hayward, catching two balls from Hayward, and dunking it.\n\nTerrence Ross won the 2013 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest after a tomahawk dunk in tribute to former Toronto Raptors player Vince Carter, as well as a between-the-legs dunk performed while jumping over a ball boy. Ross took on Jeremy Evans of the Utah Jazz, Eric Bledsoe of the Los Angeles Clippers, Kenneth Faried of the Denver Nuggets, Gerald Green of the Indiana Pacers, and James White of the New York Knicks. Evans advanced to the final round to defend his title of slam dunk champion, but was thwarted by Ross. Ross carried the momentum of his near-perfect first round, in which he scored a 99 out of a possible 100, with a stellar final round. Ross won the competition decisively, earning 58% of the vote.\n\nTeam East, composed of dunkers Paul George, defending champion Terrence Ross, and John Wall won the 2014 Sprite Slam Dunk Contest in commanding fashion. Under the new team format, they dominated the Freestyle Round, capping it off with a pass off the backboard from Ross to Wall, then off the shot clock from Wall to George for the finish. In the Battle Round, Ross defeated Damian Lillard with a through the legs dunk from rapper Drake, George took down Harrison Barnes with a 360-degree, through the legs finish, and Wall defeated Ben McLemore by jumping over the Wizards' mascot G-Man and throwing down a reverse on the first try. Though Team East are the official winners, Wall was voted by fans as the Dunker of the Night.\n\nTo the delight of NBA fans, the 2015 contest was changed back to its original format, as the Freestyle Round as well as the teams were taken out. The 4 dunkers competing were all up-and-coming players: The Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Timberwolves' Zach LaVine, the Magic's Victor Oladipo, and the Nets' Mason Plumlee. LaVine took home the hardware with dunks that included a between-the-legs reverse, a behind-the-back slam in which he caught it in midair, a between-the-legs lefthanded dunk, and finished with a between-the-legs dunk as he caught it off the pole behind the backboard. Similar to Howard with Superman, LaVine did his first dunk with a cultural homage, wearing Michael Jordan's jersey from \"Space Jam\".\n\nMany people, including 2010 winner Nate Robinson, thought that the 2011 contest was rigged to allow up-and-coming star Blake Griffin to win and that runner-up JaVale McGee deserved to win. It was even disputed if Griffin even legitimately qualified for the finals since his final dunk got a perfect score but was basically a copy of DeMar DeRozan's first dunk with a lower degree of difficulty. Ben Maller of Fox Sports Radio reported that a media advisory sent out by the NBA over an hour before the 2011 Slam Dunk Contest began already referring to Blake Griffin as the winner. \n\nThere have been 25 players crowned the best dunkers in the NBA. Nate Robinson is the only player to win the event three times. Five are two-time winners: Dominique Wilkins, Michael Jordan, Harold Miner, Jason Richardson and Zach LaVine.\n\n\nSlam Dunk Contest champions by franchise\n\nBold denotes winner(s) of that year.\n\n1984\n1985\n\n1986\n\n1987\n1988\n\"Ron Harper (Cleveland) was to participate but withdrew due to injury.\"\n1989\n\n1990\n1991\"Beginning with this year, final round competitors were allowed three dunks, with the two highest scores comprising the total.\"\n1992\n\n1993\"The two highest score dunks of three in each round constituted the competitor's score.Shawn Kemp (Seattle) was scheduled to compete but was injured.\"\n1994\"In the first round, each competitor was allowed 90 seconds to do as many dunks as he chooses with one overall score.

One is that players who often compete in these contests are seen as dunkers only (with the obvious exceptions of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and Julius Erving), which is why notable high flying athletes like Shawn Marion and LeBron James have sometimes refused to participate. High-profile players such as Dwyane Wade and Charles Barkley have also declined to participate citing it as an unnecessary risk to injury. In the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Tracy McGrady injured his wrist while performing a dunk. Also in the 1995 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Tony Dumas hurt his knee while performing his \"Texas Twister\" dunk. Although a longtime critic, LeBron James said he would perform in the 2010 Slam Dunk Contest. This decision was made after watching the 2009 dunk contest when Dwight Howard and Nate Robinson went at it. However, he withdrew his statement once the All-Star Weekend came around.\n\nThe 2006 NBA Slam Dunk Competition between Nate Robinson and Andre Iguodala drew much criticism because players were not penalized for missing a dunk attempt. Consequently, Robinson attempted a single dunk 14 times before completing it. Prior to the 2007 competition, the NBA changed a few rules to prevent excessive dunk attempts. Each participant has two minutes to complete their dunk. At the end of the two minutes allotted, they then have their number of dunk attempts limited to two.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "329877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=329877", "title": "Taijitu", "text": "Taijitu\n\nA taijitu () is a symbol or diagram ( \"tú\") in Chinese philosophy representing Taiji ( \"tàijí\" \"great pole\" or \"supreme ultimate\") representing both its monist (\"wuji\") and its dualist (yin and yang) aspects. Such a diagram was first introduced by Song Dynasty philosopher Zhou Dunyi (周敦頤 1017–1073) in his \"Taijitu shuo\" 太極圖說.\n\nThe modern Taoist canon, compiled during the Ming era, has at least half a dozen variants of such \"taijitu\". The two most similar are the \"Taiji Primal Heaven\" (太極先天圖 \"tàijí xiāntiān tú\") and the \"wuji\" (無極圖 \"wújí tú\") diagrams, both of which have been extensively studied during the Qing period for their possible connection with Zhou Dunyi's \"taijitu\".\n\nMing period author Lai Zhide (1525–1604) simplified the \"taijitu\" to a design of two interlocking spirals. In the Ming era, the combination of the two interlocking spirals of the \"taijitu\" with two black-and-white dots superimposed on them became identified with the \"He tu\" or \"Yellow River diagram\" (河圖). This version was reported in Western literature of the late 19th century as the \"Great Monad\", and has been widely popularised in Western popular culture as the \"yin-yang symbol\" since the 1960s. The contemporary Chinese term for the modern symbol is \"two-part Taiji diagram\".\n\nUnicode features the \"yin-yang symbol\" in the Miscellaneous Symbols block, at code point U+262F (YIN YANG ☯). The related \"double body symbol\" is included at U+0FCA (TIBETAN SYMBOL NOR BU NYIS -KHYIL ࿊), in the Tibetan block.\nThe Soyombo symbol, that includes a taijitu, is available in Unicode as U+11A9E, 𑪞, U+11A9F, 𑪟, and U+11AA0, 𑪠.\n\nOrnamental patterns with visual similarity to the \"yin-yang symbol\" are found in archaeological artefacts of European prehistory; such designs are sometimes descriptively dubbed \"yin yang symbols\" in archaeological literature by modern scholars.\n\nThe \"taijitu\" consists of five parts. Strictly speaking, the \"yin and yang symbol\", itself popularly called \"taijitu\", represents the second of these five parts of the diagram.\n\n\nThe term \"taijitu\" in modern Chinese is commonly used to mean the simple \"divided circle\" form (), but it may refer to any of several schematic diagrams that contain at least one circle with an inner pattern of symmetry representing yin and yang.\n\nWhile the concept of yin and yang dates to Chinese antiquity,\nthe interest in \"diagrams\" (圖 \"tú\") is an intellectual fashion of Neo-Confucianism during the Song period (11th century), and it declined again\nin the Ming period, by the 16th century.\n\nThe original description of a \"taijitu\" is due to Song era philosopher Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073), author of the \"Taijitu shuo\" \"Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate\", which became the cornerstone of Neo-Confucianist cosmology. His brief text synthesized aspects of Chinese Buddhism and Taoism with metaphysical discussions in the \"Yijing\".\n\nZhou's key terms Wuji and Taiji appear in the opening line , which Adler notes could also be translated \"The Supreme Polarity that is Non-Polar\".\nNon-polar (\"wuji\") and yet Supreme Polarity (\"taiji\")! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates \"yang\"; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates \"yin\"; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing \"yin\" and \"yang\", the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of \"yang\" and \"yin\" generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] \"qi\" harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply \"yin\" and \"yang\"; \"yin\" and \"yang\" are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature.\nInstead of usual \"Taiji\" translations \"Supreme Ultimate\" or \"Supreme Pole\", Adler uses \"Supreme Polarity\" (see Robinet 1990) because Zhu Xi describes it as the alternating principle of \"yin\" and \"yang\", and ...\ninsists that \"taiji\" is not a thing (hence \"Supreme Pole\" will not do). Thus, for both Zhou and Zhu, \"taiji\" is the \"yin-yang\" principle of bipolarity, which is the most fundamental ordering principle, the cosmic \"first principle.\" \"Wuji\" as \"non-polar\" follows from this. \n\nSince the 12th century, there has been a vigorous discussion in Chinese philosophy regarding the ultimate origin of Zhou Dunyi's diagram.\nZhu Xi (12th century) insists that Zhou Dunyi had composed the diagram himself, against the prevailing view that he had received it from Daoist sources.\nZhu Xi could not accept a Daoist origin of the design, because it would have undermined the claim of uniqueness attached to the Neo-Confucian concept of \"dao\".\n\nWhile Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073) popularized the circular diagram, the introduction of \"swirling\" patterns first appears in the Ming period.\n\nZhao Huiqian (趙撝謙, 1351–1395) was the first to introduce the \"swirling\" variant of the \"taijitu\" in his \"Liushu benyi\" (六書本義, 1370s).\nThe diagram is combined with the eight trigrams (\"bagua\") and called the \"River Chart spontaneously generated by Heaven and Earth\".\nBy the end of the Ming period, this diagram had become a widespread representation of Chinese cosmology.\nThe dots were introduced in the later Ming period (replacing the droplet-shapes used earlier, in the 16th century) and are encountered more frequently in the Qing period. The dots represent the seed of yin within yang and the seed of yang within yin; the idea that neither can exist without the other. \n\nLai Zhide's design is similar to the \"gakyil\" (\"dga' 'khyil\" or \"wheel of joy\") symbols of Tibetan Buddhism;\nbut while the Tibetan designs have three or four swirls (representing the Three Jewels or the Four Noble Truths, i.e. as a triskele and a tetraskelion design), Lai Zhide's taijitu has two swirls, terminating in a central circle.\n\nThe Ming-era design of the taijitu of two interlocking spirals has been reported as \"yin-yang symbol\" in the first half of the 20th century.\nThe flag of South Korea, originally introduced as the flag of Joseon era Korea in 1882, shows this symbol in red and blue. This was a modernisation of the older (early 19th century) form of the Bat Quai Do used as the Joseon royal standard.\n\nSince the 1960s, \"yin-yang symbol\" is most widely applied to the \"He tu\" symbol which combines the two interlocking spirals with two dots.\nIn the standard form of the contemporary \"yin-yang symbol\", one draws on the diameter of a circle two non-overlapping circles each of which has a diameter equal to the radius of the outer circle. One keeps the line that forms an \"S\", and one erases or obscures the other line. The design is also described \"pair of fishes nestling head to tail against each other\".\n\nThe Soyombo symbol of Mongolia may be prior to 1686.\nIt combines several abstract shapes, including a \"Taiji\" symbol illustrating the mutual complement of man and woman. In socialist times, it was alternatively interpreted as two fish symbolizing vigilance, because fish never close their eyes.\n\nThe modern symbol has also been widely used in martial arts, particularly t'ai chi ch'uan (Taijiquan), and Jeet Kune Do, since the 1970s.\nIn this context, it is generally used to represent the interplay between hard and soft techniques.\n\nThe dots in the modern \"yin-yang symbol\" have been given the additional interpretation of \"intense interaction\" between the complementary principles.\n\nSimilarities can be seen in Tripilja culture in Ukraine, displayed in the Ukraine pavilion at the Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China. Also, the interlocking design is found in artifacts of the European Iron Age.\n\nWhile this design appears to become a standard ornamental motif in Iron-Age Celtic culture by the 3rd century BC, found on a wide variety of artifacts, it is not clear what symbolic value was attached to it. Unlike the Chinese symbol, the Celtic yin-yang lack the element of mutual penetration, and the two halves are not always portrayed in different colors. Comparable designs are also found in Etruscan art.\n\n\n\n"}

It is mainly based on the stories of the mutant turtles Donatello, Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Raphael, and their rat sensei Splinter. It is set in a separate reality from other TMNT stories.\n\nThe initial storylines were close adaptations of the TMNT 1987 TV series, but by the fifth issue the creators handed the series over to Ryan Brown and Stephen Murphy. In their hands the comic immediately diverged from the cartoon series into unique new story arcs, often incorporating social, environmentalist, and animal-rights themes. It also introduced several new characters of various races and backgrounds, including humans, mutants, aliens, and other anthropomorphic creatures. Additionally, the series added new layers to established players such as April O'Neil, who began training with a katana, and the Shredder, who gradually revealed a sense of honor. The stories were often seen as 'deeper' and more 'serious' than the cartoon. As the new tales and characters were explored, original antagonists Krang, Bebop and Rocksteady were eventually phased out early, making later appearances during stories involving alien worlds. Shredder would remain a recurring adversary.\n\nThe series ran for 72 issues; in addition, there were numerous annuals, specials and miniseries. In celebration of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' 25th Anniversary, Archie Comics released a 104-page, full-color trade paperback collection of the first three issues in 2009, which was the adaptation of the original animated show's miniseries \"Heroes in a Half Shell\". Mirage Studios also printed a trade for the 25th anniversary, titled \"Future Tense\" reprinting \"Mighty Mutanimals\" #7 and \"TMNT Adventures\" #42–44 and #62–66 in July 2009. \"Future Tense\" was released to coincide with a planned release of the storyline from Mirage entitled \"Forever War\", but this eventually was canceled.\n\nHeroes in a Half Shell: Mini-series #1–3\n\nIssues #1–4\n\nIssues #5–11\n\nIssues #12–13\n\nIssues #14–18\n\nIssues #19–20\n\nIssues #21–25\n\nIssues #26–27\n\nMightnight Sun: Issues #28–30\n\nIssues #31–36\n\nIssue #37\n\nIssues #38-39\n\nIssues #40–41\n\nThe Future Shark Trilogy: Issues #42–44 \n\nMutations: Issue #45\n\nIssue #46\n\nIssue #47\n\nBlack Hole Trilogy: Issues #48–50\n\nThe Sons of Silence abduct Donatello and communicate with him telepathically. Sarnath is found in the same limbo that they are in, technically located within the black hole. The Turnstone is present, which was thought to have been put out of existence (Reference back to Issue #13). Donatello begins to communicate with the Turnstone. The Armada, which includes the Nova Posse, Cudley, and some more old friends, prepare to battle against Emperor Mazool, who wants to rule the rest of Dimension X. The Armada moves in and attacks as the black hole begins to double in size with no sign of stopping. \n\nTerracide: Issues #55–57\n\nEarly Years: Issue #58\n\nBlind Sight: Issues #59–60\n\nIssue #61\n\nCyber Samurai Mutant Ninja Turtles: Issues #62–66\n\nMoon Eyes Saga: Issues #67–70\n\nThe Early Years: Issues #71–72\n\nArchie Comics also released several spin-offs of the main \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures\" title. \"Mighty Mutanimals\" featured a team made up of the Turtles' mutated animal allies. Other spin-offs included miniseries such as \"April O'Neil\", which gave the Turtles' ally the lead role, and comics starring characters like Merdude and Leatherhead. One one-shot depicted the Turtles meeting Archie Andrews.\n\nThree audioplay adaptations were produced by Radio Arts Productions, Inc. and released on audio cassette by Random House. Published from 1988–1991, they feature an uncredited voice cast. These books include the three-part \"Heroes in a Half-Shell!\" story which was merged into one five-chapter book title \"Heroes in a Half-Shell!: The Complete Adventure!\". The second book is \"Return of the Shredder\", and the final book, \"Intergalactic Wrestling and Other Adventures\", includes the stories \"Of Turtles and Stones and Mary Bones\", \"Intergalactic Wrestling\" and \"Wild Things\".\n\n\n\n"}

The exhibit is accompanied by the annual Power of Children Awards recognizing local children in grades 6–11 who have made a significant contribution to the local community. The exhibit has received critical acclaim among Museology professionals and received a 2009 American Association for State and Local History \"award of merit\".\n\nEstablished in 2007, and targeting children aged 10–14, it \"provides a safe place for families and students to explore issues of intolerance, fear, and prejudice and related historical artifacts as experienced in the lives of three children Anne Frank, Ruby Bridges, and Ryan White.\" Respectively, these case studies allow children to learn about the holocaust, AIDS, and racial segregation illustrated by the experiences of the three children. The use of artifacts and immersive exhibit design (including, among other things a complete recreation of Ryan's bedroom), allow children to imagine themselves in the situation that each of the famous children faced. \"[t]he stories of ordinary children in history can inspire young people today to fight prejudice and discrimination and make a positive difference in the world\".\n\nThe exhibit uses the museum theater technique of first-person interpretation to make an interactive experience. Closing off a section of the exhibition space and inviting the audience to immerse themselves in the setting (in the case of the Ruby Bridges portion - by sitting in a replica classroom), an adult actor makes a 10–15 minute performance using props and some interaction. The quality of execution and educational effectiveness of this part of the exhibition has drawn particular praise from museum theorists as it \"...integrate[s] live theater experiences into exhibition spaces, more naturally connecting visitors to important objects and stories\".\n\nIn 2010 Elton John performed a benefit concert in Indianapolis to support the exhibit. The Elton John AIDS Foundation was founded in honor of Ryan White.\n\nPredating the development of the permanent exhibition, the \"Power of Children Awards\" are given annually to between four and six recipients, presented at a gala dinner attended by local dignitaries, the runners-up and winners' families and the museum's executive. The awards aims to \"recognize Indiana youths who have made a significant impact on the lives of others, demonstrated selflessness, and exhibited a commitment to service and the betterment of society\". Each award includes: a $2000 grant to continue the project; a four-year scholarship to either the University of Indianapolis or IUPUI; a short showcase video on local television station WISH-TV; and a display panel within the \"Power of Children\" exhibition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2409029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2409029", "title": "The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things", "text": "The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things is a painting attributed to Hieronymus Bosch or to a follower of his, completed around 1500 or later. Since 1898 its authenticity has been questioned several times. In 2015 the Bosch Research Conservation Project claimed it to be by a follower, but scholars at the Prado, where the painting hangs, dismissed this argument. The painting is oil on wooden panels and is presented in a series of circular images.\n\nFour small circles, detailing the four last things — Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell — surround a larger circle in which the seven deadly sins are depicted: wrath at the bottom, then (proceeding clockwise) envy, greed, gluttony, sloth, extravagance (later replaced with lust), and pride, using scenes from life rather than allegorical representations of the sins.\n\nAt the centre of the large circle, which is said to represent the eye of God, is a \"pupil\" in which Christ can be seen emerging from his tomb. Below this image is the Latin inscription \"Cave cave d[omi]n[u]s videt\" (\"Beware, Beware, The Lord Sees\").\n\nAbove and below the central image are inscription in Latin of Deuteronomy 32:28–29, containing the lines \"For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them\", above, and \"O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!\" below.\n\nIn 1560, Felipe de Guevara wrote about a pupil of Bosch, an unnamed \"discipulo\" (pupil), who was as good as his master and even signed his works with his master's name. Immediately after this, and without starting a new paragraph, Guevara refers to the painting of the \"Seven Deadly Sins\" as characteristic of his style. This led some scholars, as early as Dollmayr (1898) and most vocally Stechow (1966), to ascribe the work to this pupil. \n\nMost experts have argued since, however, that given the highly ambiguous nature of the passage, Guevara had probably returned to a description of the works of Bosch himself. Furthermore, the accuracy and authority of Guevara is suspect: when in 1570 Guevara's heirs sold a copy of \"The Haywain Triptych\" to Phillip II of Spain, it was made clear that Guevara had regarded that work as the original painted by Bosch himself, whilst nowadays it is known that his was a copy (displayed in El Escorial), of the original hanging in Prado. Phillip II of Spain himself purchased the work (prior to 1560, probably from a monastery art sale) in the belief that \"The Seven Deadly Sins\" was a Bosch original, and he always regarded it as such. It was his favourite Bosch painting and it hung in his own bedroom in El Escorial. When he donated the painting to El Escorial in 1574, it was cataloged as being a Bosch original; Silva Maroto argued that it is hard to believe that Guevara would question the authorship of Phillip's favourite Bosch \n\nThe alleged poor quality of the drawing had led to the incorrect belief it dates from Bosch's early period. The attribution to the \"discipulo\" was revived in the catalogue of the 2001 Bosch exhibition in Rotterdam, by Vermet and Vandenbroeck, who also suggested that several of the costumes suggest a much later date, around 1500, so that the awkward drawing and execution cannot be attributed to youthful imperfection. They also noted that the painting is not on oak, adding to their doubts about the attribution to Bosch. \n\nNowadays, most art historians agree that the costumes point at a date in between 1505 and 1510; it is argued that the key characteristics of the underlying drawing, the way the pictorial surface was developed, and the variety of strokes are entirely consistent with Bosch's later paintings. Furthermore, the theme, symbolism and the composition itself is profoundly original, which would make it extremely unlikely that an unknown pupil could have painted it.\n\nIn 2005, Ed Hoffman argued for the work being a copy, perhaps ordered by Philip II of Spain after the original had been damaged. In his view, the amateurish style, the plump figures, the lack of white highlights and the fact that the wooden panel is not oak but poplar (which can't be dated with dendrochronology). An argument for the authenticity, or at least originality, of the work could be found in the pentimenti of the underpainting, which indicate it could not have been a simple faithful reproduction. In addition, there is no question signature in the painting is that of Bosch himself, and not a forgery.\n\nIn October 2015, the Bosch Research and Conservation Project, which had been responsible, since 2007, for technical research on most of Bosch's paintings, rejected the attribution to Bosch and deemed it to be made by a follower, most likely the \"discipulo\". In response, the Prado Museum stated that they still consider the piece to be authentic.\n\nEach panel in the outer circle depicts a different sin. Clockwise from top (Latin names in brackets):\n\n\nThe four small circles also have details. In Death of the Sinner, death is shown at the doorstep along with an angel and a demon while the priest says the sinner's last rites, In Glory, the saved are entering Heaven, with Jesus and the saints, at the gate of Heaven an Angel prevents a demon from ensnaring a woman. Saint Peter is shown as the gatekeeper. In Judgment, Christ is shown in glory while angels awake the dead, while in the Hell demons torment sinners according to their sins.\n\n"}
