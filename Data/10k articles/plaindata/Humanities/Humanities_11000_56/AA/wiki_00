They were used on renaissance monuments when patron saints became unacceptable. Particularly popular were the four cardinal virtues and the three Christian virtues, but others such as fame, victory, hope and time are also represented. The use of allegorical sculpture was fully developed under the École des Beaux-Arts. It is sometimes associated with Victorian art, and is commonly found in works dating from around 1900.\n\n"}

Jackson on vocals, Keith Haynie on bass guitar, Jimmy \"Vegas\" Tanner on drums, Bill Hubauer and Chris VonBartheld on keyboard, and Tom Milnes and Tom Tincha (a.k.a. \"TNT\"), both on lead guitar.\n\nApologetiX is a play on its eponym \"apologetics\" – the defense of a religious doctrine, often, and in this case, referring to Christian apologetics. It is based on the Greek word for \"defense\", (\"apologia\") The word is used in 1 Peter 3:15: \"But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer (defense or \"apologia\") to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect...\" (NIV). Their logo, a triquetra, is an ancient symbol that has gained Christian adoption to represent the Holy Trinity.\n\nApologetiX has had six official drummers.

From 2014 to 2017, they were able to produce four albums per year. In 2018, their studio computers started to have speed issues, which slowed down the production of their albums. So far they have released two albums, with a third album on its way.\n\nApologetiX rewrites secular songs with Christian lyrics to create parodies with Christian messages, and, in the song \"We're In A Parody Band,\" ApologetiX refers to itself as a cross between \"Weird Al\" Yankovic and Billy Graham.\n\nThe band's lyrical content is derived solely from Biblical passages and practices, frequently in a tongue-in-cheek manner.

Investment in art has been an accepted form of deposit investment for several decades such as the purchase of works by Matisse, Van Gogh and Picasso. However these works only have an assured value as long as there is a restricted supply of works on the open market - i.e. the artist is dead or producing small numbers of works and that the authenticity of works can be verified by a small number of sources. In the case of contemporary artists it is the interest of collectors and therefore dealers to ensure a tightly controlled line of supply.\n\nThe intricacies of art world economics were exposed by the suit of the family of Mark Rothko against the Marlborough Fine Art Gallery brought during the 1970s. In an action known as the Rothko Case, it was determined that Marlborough had knowingly manipulated their management of Rothko's works to maintain a higher sale price after his death, to the detriment of Rothko's family's interest in his estate.\n\nThe art market was hit by the 2008 financial crash; sales were down about 41 per cent by 2009, compared with a market peak of almost $66bn in 2007. Contemporary art was particularly badly hit, with sales in that category plunging almost 60 per cent over the two years 2008-09. However, by 2011 the value of sales had almost reached the record level of 2007, and they have remained between $56bn and $68bn in the years since. \n\n"}

This could include lighting, blinds, cinema rooms.\n\nThe professional audiovisual industry is a multibillion-dollar industry, comprising the manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators, consultants, programmers, presentations professionals and technology managers of audiovisual products and services.\n\nCommercial audiovisual can sometimes be a very lengthy process to get it right. Boardroom audio visual can be installed for a number of reasons, but usually it is because the executives of the organization/business wants to have meetings with colleagues/customers/suppliers around the world. When creating an array of boardrooms for customers it has been seen that you have to be able to balance the pattern from the audio and microphone so there is no interruption in the sound quality for the individual/s listening in.\n\nThe proliferation of audiovisual communications technologies, including sound, video, lighting, display and projection systems, is evident in every sector of society: in business, education, government, the military, healthcare, retail environments, worship, sports and entertainment, hospitality, restaurants, and museums. The application of audiovisual systems is found in collaborative conferencing (which includes video-conferencing, audio-conferencing, web-conferencing and data-conferencing); presentation rooms, auditoriums, and lecture halls; command and control centers; digital signage, and more. Concerts and corporate events are among the most obvious venues where audiovisual equipment is used in a staged environment. Providers of this type of service are known as rental and staging companies, although they may also be served by an in-house technology team (e.g., in a hotel or conference center).\n\nAccording to a 2006 market forecast study by InfoComm International, a leading trade association representing the audiovisual industry, 2006 was the fourth consecutive year that significant growth was projected for the industry. Revenue for surveyed North American companies was expected to grow by 40% in 2006, and by 10.7% for European audiovisual companies. The single biggest factor for this increase is the increased demand for networked audiovisual products due to the integration of audiovisual and IT technology. The two leading markets for AV equipment in North America and Europe continue to be business/IT and education, especially as conference room technologies become more advanced.\n\nAudiovisual education is instruction where particular attention is paid to the audio and visual presentation of the material, with the goal of improving comprehension and retention.\n\n"}

It is not comprehensive and continues to be developed. It also includes a number of works that are not by anthropologists but are relevant to the field, such as literary theory, sociology, psychology, and philosophical anthropology.\n\nAnthropology is the study of humanity. Described as \"the most humanistic of sciences and the most scientific of the humanities\", it is considered to bridge the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities, and draws upon a wide range of related fields. In North America, anthropology is traditionally divided into four major subdisciplines: biological anthropology, sociocultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology and archaeology. Other academic traditions use less broad definitions, where one or more of these fields are considered separate, but related, disciplines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological anthropology is traditionally conceived of as part of the North American four-field approach. In some universities, however, the subject has repositioned itself as \"human evolutionary biology\". In Europe, it is sometimes taught as an individual subject at college level or as part of the discipline of biology. Its methods are informed by evolutionary biology, hence the adjunct \"biological\". Since 1993, the Biological Anthropology Section of the American Anthropological Association has awarded the W.W. Howells Book Award in Biological Anthropology.\n\n\nArchaeological anthropology is traditionally conceived of as part of the North American four-field approach. With the four-field approach being questioned for its orthodoxy, the subject has gained considerable independence in recent years and some archaeologists have rejected the label \"anthropology\". In Europe, the subject maintains closer connections to history and is simply conceived of as \"archaeology\" with a distinct research focus and methodology.\n\n\n\nAnthropological research has exerted considerable influence on other disciplines such as sociology, literary theory, and philosophy. Conversely, contemporary anthropological discourse has become receptive to a wide variety of theoretical currents which in turn help to shape the cognitive identity of the subject(s).

It comprises Borobudur, Mendut, and Pawon. These three temples are located in a straight line, and have been considered as being built during the Shailendra dynasty circa 8th–9th centuries.\n\nApproximately northwest of Yogyakarta, Borobudur is located in an elevated area between two twin volcanoes, Sundoro-Sumbing and Merbabu-Merapi, and two rivers, the Progo and the Elo. According to local myth, the area known as Kedu Plain is a Javanese 'sacred' place and has been dubbed 'the garden of Java' due to its high agricultural fertility.\n\nDuring the restoration in the early 20th century, it was discovered that three Buddhist temples in the region, Borobudur, Pawon and Mendut, are positioned along a straight line. It might be accidental, but the temples' alignment is in conjunction with a native folk tale that a long time ago, there was a brick-paved road from Borobudur to Mendut with walls on both sides. The three temples (Borobudur–Pawon–Mendut) have similar architecture and ornamentation derived from the same time period, which suggests that ritual relationship between the three temples, in order to have formed a sacred unity, must have existed, although exact ritual process is yet unknown.\n\nThere are two museums located within Borobudur Temple Compounds, Karmawibhangga Museum and Samudra Raksa Museum.\nBesides these three temples, there are other Buddhist and Hindu temples scattered in the area. The earliest is Gunung Wukir or Canggal Hindu temple dated 732 CE, according to Canggal inscription discovered in the temple complex, the Shivaite King Sanjaya commissioned a Shivalinga sanctuary to be built on the Wukir hill, only east of Borobudur.

{"id": "154175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154175", "title": "Calypso music", "text": "Calypso music\n\nCalypso is a style of Afro-Caribbean music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago during the early to mid-19th century and eventually spread to the rest of the Caribbean Antilles and Venezuela by the mid-20th century. Its rhythms can be traced back to West African Kaiso and the arrival of French planters and their slaves from the French Antilles in the 18th century.\n\nCalypso drew upon African and French influences, and became the voice of the people. It was characterized by highly rhythmic and harmonic vocals, and was most often sung in a French creole and led by a griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a \"chantuelle\" and eventually, \"calypsonian\". As English replaced \"patois\" (Antillean creole) as the dominant language, calypso migrated into English, and in so doing it attracted more attention from the government. It allowed the masses to challenge the doings of the unelected Governor and Legislative Council, and the elected town councils of Port of Spain and San Fernando. Calypso continued to play an important role in political expression, and also served to document the history of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nCalypso in the Caribbean includes a range of genres, including: the Benna genre of Antiguan and Barbudan music; Mento, a style of Jamaican folk music that greatly influenced ska and reggae; Ska, the precursor to rocksteady and reggae; Spouge, a style of Barbadian popular music; Dominica Cadence-lypso, which mixed calypso with the cadence of Haiti; and soca music, a style of Kaiso/calypso, with influences from cadence-lypso, soul, and funk.\n\nIt is thought that the name \"calypso\" was originally \"kaiso\" which is now believed to come from Efik \"ka isu\" (\"go on!\") and Ibibio \"kaa iso\" (\"continue, go on\"), used in urging someone on or in backing a contestant. There is also a Trinidadian term \"cariso\" that means \"old-time\" calypsos. The term \"calypso\" is recorded from the 1930s onwards. Alternatively, the insert for \"The Rough Guide to Calypso and Soca\" (published by World Music Network) favours John Cowley's arguments in \"Carnival, Canboulay and Calypso: Traditions in the Making,\" that the word might be a corruption of the French \"carrouseaux\" and through the process of patois and Anglicization became \"caliso\" and then finally \"calypso\"; however, Cowley also notes that the first mention of the word \"calypso\" is given in a description of a dance in 1882 by Abbé Masse.\n\nCalypso music was developed in Trinidad in the 17th century from the West African Kaiso and canboulay music brought by African slaves imported to that Caribbean island to work on sugar plantations. The slaves, brought to toil on sugar plantations, were stripped of all connections to their homeland and family and not allowed to talk to each other. They used calypso to mock the slave masters and to communicate with each other. Many early calypsos were sung in French Creole by an individual called a griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a \"chantuelle\" and eventually, \"calypsonian\".\n\nModern calypso, however, began in the 19th century, a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the masquerade song \"lavway\", French Creole \"belair\" and the calinda stick-fighting chantwell. Calypso's early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by Trinidadian slaves, including canboulay drumming and the music masquerade processions. The French brought Carnival to Trinidad, and calypso competitions at Carnival grew in popularity, especially after the abolition of slavery in 1834.\n\nThe first identifiably calypso genre song was recorded in 1912, by Lovey's String Band while visiting New York City. In 1914, the second calypso song was recorded, this time in Trinidad, by chantwell Julian Whiterose, better known as the Iron Duke and famous calinda stick-fighter. Jules Sims would also record vocal calypsos. The majority of these calypsos of the World War I era were instrumentals by Lovey and Lionel Belasco. Perhaps due to the constraints of the wartime economy, no recordings of note were produced until the late 1920s and early 1930s, when the \"golden era\" of calypso would cement the style, form, and phrasing of the music.\n\nCalypso evolved into a way of spreading news around Trinidad. Politicians, journalists and public figures often debated the content of each song, and many islanders considered these songs the most reliable news source. Calypsonians pushed the boundaries of free speech as their lyrics spread news of any topic relevant to island life, including speaking out against political corruption. Eventually British rule enforced censorship and police began to scan these songs for damaging content.\n\nEven with this censorship, calypsos continued to push boundaries, with a variety of ways to slip songs past the scrutinizing eyes of the editor. Double entendre, or double-speak, was one way, as was the practice of denouncing countries such as Hitler's Germany and its annexation of Poland, while making pointed references toward the UK's policies on Trinidad. Sex, scandal, gossip, innuendo, politics, local news, bravado and insulting other calypsonians were the order of the day in classic calypso, just as it is today with classic hip-hop. And just as the hip-hop of today, the music sparked shock and outrage in moralistic sections of society.\n\nCountless recordings were dumped at sea in the name of censorship, although in truth, rival US companies did this in the spirit of underhanded competition, claiming that the rivals' material was unfit for US consumption. Decca Records lost untold pressings in this manner, as did its rival, RCA's Bluebird label.\n\nAn entrepreneur named Eduardo Sa Gomes played a significant role in spreading calypso in its early days. Sa Gomes, a Portuguese immigrant who owned a local music and phonograph equipment shop in Port of Spain, promoted the genre and gave financial support to the local artists. In March 1934, he sent Roaring Lion and Attila the Hun to New York City to record; they became the first calypsonians to record abroad, bringing the genre out of the West Indies and into pop culture. Lord Invader was quick to follow, and staying in New York City after a protracted legal case involving the theft of his song \"Rum and Coca-Cola\", a hit by the Andrews Sisters, made his home there along with Wilmoth Houdini, and became one of the great calypsonians of the USA.\n\nEarly forms of calypso were also influenced by jazz such as Sans Humanitae. In this extempo (extemporaneous) melody calypsonians lyricise impromptu, commenting socially or insulting each other, \"sans humanité\" or \"no mercy\" (which is again a reference to French influence).\n\nThe first major stars of calypso started crossing over to new audiences worldwide in the late 1930s. Attila the Hun, Roaring Lion and Lord Invader were first, followed by Lord Kitchener, one of the longest-lasting calypso stars in history—he continued to release hit records until his death in 2000. 1944's \"Rum and Coca-Cola\" by the Andrews Sisters, a cover version of a Lord Invader song, became an American hit despite the song being a very critical commentary on the explosion of prostitution, inflation and other negative influences accompanying the American military bases in Trinidad at the time. Perhaps the most straightforward way to describe the focus of calypso is that it articulated itself as a form of protest against the authoritarian colonial culture which existed at the time.\n\nCalypso, especially a toned-down, commercial variant, became a worldwide craze with the release of the \"Banana Boat Song\", or \"Day-O\", a traditional Jamaican folk song, whose best-known rendition was done by Harry Belafonte on his album \"Calypso\" (1956); \"Calypso\" was the first full-length record to sell more than a million copies. The success of that album inspired hundreds of \"Folkies\", or the American folk music revival to imitate the \"Belafonte style\", but with a more folk-oriented flavor. The Kingston Trio would be a good example. 1956 also saw the massive international hit \"Jean and Dinah\" by Mighty Sparrow. This song too was a sly commentary as a \"plan of action\" for the calypsonian on the widespread prostitution and the prostitutes' desperation after the closing of the U.S. naval base on Trinidad at Chaguaramas.\n\nIn the Broadway-theatre musical \"Jamaica\" (1957), Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg cleverly parodied \"commercial\" Belafonte-style calypso. Several films jumped on the calypso craze in 1957 such as \"Island in the Sun\" (20th Century Fox) that featured Belafonte and the low-budget films \"Calypso Joe\" (Allied Artists), \"Calypso Heat Wave\" (Columbia Pictures), and \"Bop Girl Goes Calypso\" (United Artists).\nRobert Mitchum released an album, \"Calypso...Is Like So\" (1957), on Capitol records, capturing the sound, spirit, and subtleties of the genre.\nDizzy Gillespie recorded a calypso album \"Jambo Caribe\" (1964) with James Moody and Kenny Barron.\n\nSoul shouter Gary \"US\" Bonds released a calypso album \"Twist up Calypso\" (1962) on Legrand records, shortly after returning home from his military post in Port of Spain. Nithi Kanagaratnam from Sri Lanka sang calypso-styled songs in Tamil in 1968, which was a success and earned him the title \"Father of Tamil Popular Music\". Since Baila rhythm was popular in Sri Lanka, most of his songs were classified as Tamil Baila. \n\nIn the mid-1970s, women entered the calypso men's-oriented arena. [2] Calypso Rose was the first woman to win the Trinidad Road March competition in 1977 with her song \"Gimme More Tempo\". The following year with \"Come Leh We Jam\", she won the \"Calypso King \" competition, the first time a woman had received the award. The competition's title was changed to Calypso Monarch in her honour.\nThe French and pioneer electronic musician Jean Michel Jarre released an album in 1990 called \"Waiting for Cousteau\". The album has four tracks: \"Calypso\", \"Calypso part 2\", \"Calypso part 3 Fin de Siècle\" and \"Waiting for Cousteau\". It was dedicated to Jacques-Yves Cousteau in his 80th birthday. This album had a special participation of the Amocco Renegades (a traditional steel-drum band from Trinidad and Tobago). In the first track is possible to notice a strong style influence. Calypso had another short burst of commercial interest when Tim Burton's horror/comedy film \"Beetlejuice\" (1988) was released, and used Belafonte's \"Jump In The Line\" as the soundtrack´s headliner and also \"The Banana Boat Song\" in the dinner-party scene. Disney's song \"Under the Sea\", a calypso theme from \"The Little Mermaid\" won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1989 as well as the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media in 1991.\n\n\n"}

As Nagy was preparing for college at the University of Wisconsin, she met and married her husband, and transferred to the University of Connecticut. Jacklin completed a BA and MA in psychology at the University of Connecticut. Short on money, Carol Jacklin became a teacher at the University of Connecticut and then San Jose City College. After attending a psychology conference she realised she wanted to get a PhD in developmental psychology, after which she applied and was accepted for postgraduate studies at Brown University. She completed her PhD at Brown University in 1972.\n\nJacklin moved to Stanford, where she completed postdoctoral studies alongside Eleanor Maccoby. Jacklin and Maccoby began to observe parent-child interactions, identifying negative portrayals of women in scientific literature. Their research was published in the critically acclaimed 1974 book \"The Psychology of Sex Differences\", which became front page of The New York Times Book Review. In 1975 it was a best seller in The New York Times. Here they dismissed many beliefs about gender differences: that girls are more social than boys, have lower self-esteem and are better at rote learning, arguing that the evidence does not support the existence of gender differences.\n\nAt Stanford Jacklin became a vocal women's rights activist, who campaigned against injustices facing women. She was a founding member of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research alongside Myra Strober. In 1983, The New York Times described her as a \"leading expert on gender differences\". Jacklin and Maccoby were two of the first researchers to study the differences between boys’ and girls’ learning.\n\nJacklin moved to the University of Southern California in 1983, where she was the first woman to become a tenured psychology professor.

{"id": "610329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=610329", "title": "Clandestine chemistry", "text": "Clandestine chemistry\n\nClandestine chemistry is chemistry carried out in secret, and particularly in illegal drug laboratories. Larger labs are usually run by gangs or organized crime intending to produce for distribution on the black market. Smaller labs can be run by individual chemists working clandestinely in order to synthesize smaller amounts of controlled substances or simply out of a hobbyist interest in chemistry, often because of the difficulty in ascertaining the purity of other, illegally synthesized drugs obtained on the black market. The term \"clandestine lab\" is generally used in any situation involving the production of illicit compounds, regardless of whether the facilities being used qualify as a true laboratory.\n\nAncient forms of clandestine chemistry included the manufacturing of explosives.\n\nAnother old form of clandestine chemistry is the illegal brewing and distillation of alcohol. This is frequently done to avoid taxation on spirits.\n\nFrom 1919 to 1933, the United States prohibited the sale, manufacture, or transportation of alcoholic beverages. This opened a door for brewers to supply their own town with alcohol. Just like modern-day drug labs, distilleries were placed in rural areas. The term \"moonshine\" generally referred to \"corn whiskey\", that is, a whiskey-like liquor made from corn. Today, American-made corn whiskey can be labeled or sold under that name, or as Bourbon or Tennessee whiskey, depending on the details of the production process.\n\nPrepared substances (as opposed to those that occur naturally in a consumable form, such as cannabis and psilocybin mushrooms) require reagents. Some drugs, like cocaine and morphine, are extracted from plant sources and refined with the aid of chemicals. Semi-synthetic drugs such as heroin are made starting from alkaloids extracted from plant sources which are the precursors for further synthesis. In the case of heroin, a mixture of alkaloids is extracted from the opium poppy (\"Papaver somniferum\") by incising its seed capsule, whereupon a milky fluid (the opium 'latex') bleeds out of the incisions which is then left to dry out and scraped off the bulbs, yielding raw opium. Morphine, one of many alkaloids in opium, is then extracted out of the opium by acid-base extraction and turned into heroin by reacting it with acetic anhydride. Other drugs (such as methamphetamine and MDMA) are normally made from commercially available chemicals, though both can also be made from naturally occurring precursors. Methamphetamine can also be made from ephedrine, one of the naturally occurring alkaloids in ephedra (\"Ephedra sinica\"). MDMA can be made from safrole, the major constituent of several etheric oils like sassafras. Governments have adopted a strategy of chemical control as part of their overall drug control and enforcement plans. Chemical control offers a means of attacking illicit drug production and disrupting the process before the drugs have entered the market.\n\nBecause many legitimate industrial chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia and iodine are also necessary in the processing and synthesis of most illicitly produced drugs, preventing the diversion of these chemicals from legitimate commerce to illicit drug manufacturing is a difficult job. Governments often place restrictions on the purchase of large quantities of chemicals that can be used in the production of illicit drugs, usually requiring licenses or permits to ensure that the purchaser has a legitimate need for them.\n\nChemicals critical to the production of cocaine, heroin, and synthetic drugs are produced in many countries throughout the world. Many manufacturers and suppliers exist in Europe, China, India, the United States, and a host of other countries.\n\nHistorically, chemicals critical to the synthesis or manufacture of illicit drugs are introduced into various venues via legitimate purchases by companies that are registered and licensed to do business as chemical importers or handlers. Once in a country or state, the chemicals are diverted by rogue importers or chemical companies, by criminal organizations and individual violators, or acquired as a result of coercion and/or theft on the part of drug traffickers. In response to stricter international controls, drug traffickers have increasingly been forced to divert chemicals by mislabeling the containers, forging documents, establishing front companies, using circuitous routing, hijacking shipments, bribing officials, or smuggling products across international borders.\n\nThe Multilateral Chemical Reporting Initiative encourages governments to exchange information on a voluntary basis in order to monitor international chemical shipments. Over the past decade, key international bodies like the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the U.N. General Assembly's Special Session (UNGASS) have addressed the issue of chemical diversion in conjunction with U.S. efforts. These organizations raised specific concerns about potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride.\n\nTo facilitate the international flow of information about precursor chemicals, the United States, through its relationship with the Inter-American Drug Control Abuse Commission (CICAD), continues to evaluate the use of precursor chemicals and assist countries in strengthening controls. Many nations still lack the capacity to determine whether the import or export of precursor chemicals is related to legitimate needs or illicit drugs. The problem is complicated by the fact that many chemical shipments are either brokered or transshipped through third countries in an attempt to disguise their purpose or destination.\n\nBeginning in July 2001, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) has opted to organize an international conference with the goal of devising a specific action plan to counter the traffic in MDMA precursor chemicals. They hope to prevent the diversion of chemicals used in the production of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), including MDMA (ecstasy) and methamphetamine.\n\nIn June 2015, the European Commission approved Regulation (EU) 2015/1013 which outlined for the monitoring of drug precursors traded between the Union and third countries. The Regulation also establishes uniform procedures for licensing and registration of operators and users who are listed in a European database tracking drug precursors.\n\nDespite this long history of law enforcement actions, restrictions of chemicals, and even covert military actions, many illicit drugs are still widely available all over the world.\n\nOperation Purple is a U.S. DEA driven international chemical control initiative designed to reduce the illicit manufacture of cocaine in the Andean Region, identifying rogue firms and suspect individuals; gathering intelligence on diversion methods, trafficking trends, and shipping routes; and taking administrative, civil and/or criminal action as appropriate. Critical to the success of this operation is the communication network that gives notification of shipments and provides the government of the importer sufficient time to verify the legitimacy of the transaction and take appropriate action. The effects of this initiative have been dramatic and far-reaching. Operation Purple has exposed a significant vulnerability among traffickers, and has grown to include almost thirty nations. According to the DEA, Operation Purple has been highly effective at interfering with cocaine production. However, illicit chemists always find new methods to evade the DEA's scrutiny.\n\nIn countries where strict chemical controls have been put in place, illicit drug production has been seriously affected. For example, few of the chemicals needed to process coca leaf into cocaine are manufactured in Bolivia or Peru. Most are smuggled in from neighbouring countries with advanced chemical industries or diverted from a smaller number of licit handlers. Increased interdiction of chemicals in Peru and Bolivia has contributed to final product cocaine from those countries being of lower, minimally oxidized quality.\n\nAs a result, Bolivian lab operators are now using inferior substitutes such as cement instead of lime and sodium bicarbonate instead of ammonia and recycled solvents like ether. Some non-solvent fuels such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel are even used in place of solvents. \nManufacturers are attempting to streamline a production process that virtually eliminates oxidation to produce cocaine base. Some laboratories are not using sulfuric acid during the maceration state; consequently, less cocaine alkaloid is extracted from the leaf, producing less cocaine hydrochloride, the powdered cocaine marketed for overseas consumption.\n\nSimilarly, heroin-producing countries depend on supplies of acetic anhydride (AA) from the international market. This heroin precursor continues to account for the largest volume of internationally seized chemicals, according to the International Narcotics Control Board. Since July 1999, there have been several notable seizures of acetic anhydride in Turkey (amounting to nearly seventeen metric tons) and Turkmenistan (totaling seventy-three metric tons).\n\nAcetic anhydride, the most commonly used chemical agent in heroin processing, is virtually irreplaceable. According to the DEA, Mexico remains the only heroin source route to heroin laboratories in Afghanistan. Authorities in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan routinely seize ton-quantity shipments of diverted acetic anhydride.\n\nThe lack of acetic anhydride has caused clandestine chemists in some countries to substitute it for lower quality precursors such as acetic acid and results in the formation of impure black tar heroin that contains a mixture of drugs not found in heroin made with pure chemicals.\n\nDEA's Operation Topaz is a coordinated international strategy targeting acetic anhydride. In place since March 2001, a total of thirty-one countries are currently organized participants in the program in addition to regional participants. The DEA reports that as of June 2001, some 125 consignments of acetic anhydride had been tracked totaling 618,902,223 kilograms. As of July 2001, there has been approximately 20 shipments of AA totaling 185,000 kilograms either stopped or seized.\n\nThe practice of clandestine chemistry to synthesize controlled substance analogues and circumvent drug laws was first noticed in the late 1960s, as types of drugs became controlled substances in many countries. With the Title 21 United States Code (USC) Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of October 27, 1970 amphetamines became controlled substances in the United States.\nAs of the early 1990s, methamphetamine use was concentrated among young white males in California and nearby states. Since then its use has spread both demographically and geographically. Methamphetamine has been a favorite among various populations including motorcycle gangs, truckers, laborers, soldiers, and ravers. Known as a \"club drug\", the National Institute on Drug Abuse tracks its incidence of use in children as young as twelve, and the prevalence of users increases with age.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, most methamphetamine production in the United States occurred in small independent laboratories. Phenylacetone, one precursor of methamphetamine, became a Schedule II controlled immediate precursor in 1979. Underground chemists searched for alternative methods for producing methamphetamine. The two predominant methods which appeared both involve the reduction of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine. At the time, neither was a watched chemical, and pills containing the substance could be bought by the thousands without raising any kind of suspicion.\n\nIn the 1990s, the DEA recognized that legally imported precursors were being diverted to the production of methamphetamine. Changes to federal regulations in 1988 and throughout the 1990s enabled the DEA to more closely track the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine precursors. Many individual States have enacted precursor control laws which limit the sale of over-the-counter cold medications which contain ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. This made it somewhat more difficult for underground chemists to produce methamphetamine. In May 1995, the DEA shut down two major suppliers of precursors in the United States, seizing 25 metric tons of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine from Clifton Pharmaceuticals and 500 cases of pseudoephedrine from X-Pressive Looks, Inc. (XLI). The immediate market impact suggests that they had been providing more than 50 percent of the precursors used nationally to produce methamphetamine. However, the market rapidly rebounded.\n\nThe methamphetamine situation also changed in the mid-1990s as Mexican organized crime became a major player in its production and distribution, operating \"super-labs\" which produced a substantial percentage of the drugs being sold. According to the DEA, the seizure of 3.5 metric tons of pseudoephedrine in Texas in 1994 revealed that Mexican trafficking groups were producing methamphetamine on an unprecedented scale. More recent reports indicate an ongoing presence of Mexican trafficking.\n\nAlthough the prevalence of domestic meth labs continues to be high in western states, they have spread throughout the United States. It has been suggested that \"do-it-yourself\" meth production in rural areas is reflective of a broader DIY approach that includes activities such as hunting, fishing, and fixing one’s cars, trucks, equipment, and house. Toxic chemicals resulting from methamphetamine production may be hoarded or clandestinely dumped, damaging land, water, plant life and wild life, and posing a risk to humans. Waste from methamphetamine labs is frequently dumped on federal, public, and tribal lands. The chemicals involved can explode and clandestine chemistry has been implicated in both house and wild land fires.\nStatistics reporting the prevalence of meth labs and arrest of meth producers can vary greatly from county to county and state to state. Factors affecting policing and reporting include funding, specialized training, support from local residents, willingness to make the issue a priority in policing. How information is categorized and tracked may also inflate or minimize the apparent results. Missouri, which has tended to report some of the highest numbers of meth-lab arrests in the country, has pursued an aggressive and highly publicized policing policy, resulting in as many as 205 cases a year in one county. In contrast, West Virginia tends to report and prosecute very few cases, possibly because there the agency that reports a meth lab is held responsible for paying for its cleanup. Cleanup of toxic and hazardous materials at a single site may cost tens of thousands of dollars. This is a disincentive for agencies with limited budgets. Michigan reported an increase in incidents in 2016, following the formation of the Midland County Methamphetamine Protocol Team in 2015. Many of the cases reported involved meth users who were making small amounts of the drug in a simple \"one-pot method\" for both personal use and sale to others.\n\nDEA El Paso Intelligence Center data is showing a downward trend in the number of clandestine drug labs seized for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine down from a high of 15,196 in 2010. Drug seizure quantities, on the other hand, are steadily increasing since 2007, according to data from the DEA's System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE) (see table to the right). \n\nClean up processes were regulated by the EPA as of 2007. The Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2007 required EPA to develop guidelines for remediation of former methamphetamine labs. This creates guidelines for States and local agencies to improve \"our national understanding of identifying the point at which former methamphetamine laboratories become clean enough to inhabit again.\" The legislation also required that EPA periodically update the guidelines, as appropriate, to reflect the best available knowledge and research.\nMaking a former meth lab site safer for habitation requires two basic efforts:\nGross chemical removal: This is the process in which law enforcement or a Drug Enforcement Administration contractors removes the obvious dangers from the site. Obvious dangers include containers of chemicals, equipment, and apparatus that could be used to make illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia, and other illegal items. This process does not cleanup or remove chemical spills, stains or residue that could be harmful to inhabitants. A property that has had only a gross chemical removal is not fit for habitation. \nClandestine Remediation: The cleaning of interior structures and, if applicable, the surrounding land, surface waters and groundwater by an EPA approved or National Crime Scene Clean Up Association certified company. This is the process of removing the residue and waste from the site after the gross chemical removal is done. A property that has been re-mediated should present minimal to no health risk to occupants.\n\nClandestine chemistry is not limited to drugs; it is also associated with explosives, and other illegal chemicals. Of the explosives manufactured illegally, nitroglycerin and acetone peroxide are easiest to produce due to the ease with which the precursors can be acquired.\n\nUncle Fester is a writer who commonly writes about different aspects of clandestine chemistry. \"Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture\" is among one of his most popular books, and is considered required reading for DEA Agents. More of his books deal with other aspects of clandestine chemistry, including explosives, and poisons. Fester is, however, considered by many to be a faulty and unreliable source for information in regard to the clandestine manufacture of chemicals.\n\n"}
{"id": "983972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=983972", "title": "Clannad (visual novel)", "text": "Clannad (visual novel)\n\nThe gameplay of \"Clannad\" follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the player character. The game was ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Key went on to produce an adult spin-off titled \"\" in November 2005, which expanded on the scenario of Tomoyo Sakagami, one of the five heroines from \"Clannad\".\n\n\"Clannad\" has made several transitions to other media. There have been four manga adaptations published by ASCII Media Works, Flex Comix, Fujimi Shobo and Jive. Comic anthologies, light novels and art books have also been published, as have audio dramas and several albums of music. An animated film by Toei Animation was released in September 2007, followed by two anime series including two original video animation (OVA) episodes by Kyoto Animation produced between 2007 and 2009. Both anime series and their accompanying OVAs are licensed by Sentai Filmworks and were released in North America in 2009. The animated adaptations have received high sales figures in Japan as well as critical acclaim abroad.\n\n\"Clannad\" is a drama and romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Tomoya Okazaki. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. \"Clannad\" follows a branching plot line with multiple endings; depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.\n\nThere are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, five which are initially available. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player must replay the game multiple times and make different choices to change the plot progression.\n\nWhen first playing the game, the scenarios for all five heroines and additional smaller scenarios are available in what is called the School Life story arc. When the player completes a character's scenario, he or she receives an orb of light. When eight of these lights are obtained, the game's second story arc, called After Story, is made available. One of the lights disappears during School Life, but reappears in After Story. To view the true ending of \"Clannad\", all 13 lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's complexity, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was simplified and made less intrusive.\n\nThe first half of the story takes place primarily at Hikarizaka Private High School, a fictional school located in Japan. Outside of the school, frequented locations include the bakery run by Nagisa's parents, and the dormitory where Youhei Sunohara lives. Throughout the story, glimpses into an Illusionary World are shown. This world is devoid of all life except for a young girl, though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which the player can interact with her. The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city, after the conclusion of the first half. While the town's name was never directly mentioned, one can infer that the town's name is Hikarizaka based on the many companies and establishments that share this name.\n\nThere are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. The main theme is the value of having a family, as the title of the series implies because the main scenario writer Jun Maeda mistakenly thought the name of the Irish band Clannad meant \"clan\" or \"family\" in Irish. Of the six main characters, Tomoya, Nagisa, and Kotomi have no siblings, though their parents are major factors in their stories. Nagisa's story was written to incorporate what Maeda described as a \"perfect family\" with a focus on mental consciousness. In Nagisa's story, there is a recurring appearance of (a fictional group mascot for children) that Nagisa is fond of. Tomoya's and Nagisa's characters were written in a style to exemplify a \"growth to adulthood\" by the end of the story. Fuko's and Kyou's stories have their sisters playing an integral part, and Tomoyo's story is influenced by her entire family. A minor motif of Irish words continues with the opening theme of the game, \"Mag Mell\", which means roughly \"plain of joy\" and is connected with Irish mythology. The arrange album, a short music CD that contained remixed versions of songs in the game, that was bundled with the original game release was titled \"Mabinogi\", which was a collection of prose stories from medieval Welsh manuscripts.\n\nThe player assumes the role of Tomoya Okazaki, the protagonist of \"Clannad\". Tomoya has been labeled a delinquent; at the beginning of the story, he even expresses hatred toward the city he has lived in all his life where \"Clannad\" is set. He is very straightforward in his comments to others and will not hesitate to speak his mind, even if he comes off as rude during such times. Despite this, Tomoya is loyal to his friends, and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them.\n\nTomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, the main heroine of \"Clannad\", at the onset of the story. Nagisa is a shy girl who has an illness which causes her to rely on those around her for support. She has developed the strange habit of muttering the names of favorite foods that she plans to eat as a way to motivate herself, such as anpan. Kyou Fujibayashi, another of \"Clannad\" heroines, is a loud, aggressive girl well known as a good cook among her friends and family. When angry she does not hesitate to throw a dictionary at people that she often carries around for such purposes. Despite this attitude, she also has a more subdued side, especially towards her younger fraternal twin sister Ryou Fujibayashi.\n\nTomoya meets a genius girl named Kotomi Ichinose, one day in the school library. She is ranked in the top 10 throughout the whole country in standardized exam results of every subject—she always goes to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is a quiet girl with poor social skills and it is quite difficult to communicate with her; Kotomi can even completely ignore someone when reading, even if they make loud disturbances around her. \"Clannad\" fourth heroine is a second-year student named Tomoyo Sakagami who transfers into Tomoya's school. Tomoyo is known to be a strong fighter, preferring to use kicking over punching, and is athletic. Although Tomoya is older than her, Tomoyo does not show him respect as a senior student. Tomoyo appears in Key's fifth game, \"\", as the main heroine.\n\nThe last heroine in \"Clannad\" is a first-year student named Fuko Ibuki who is eccentric and childish, before she met Tomoya, was generally seen alone by herself making wood carvings of starfish with a small knife to give to others as presents. Fuko is extremely enthralled by starfish, or things that are star-shaped, and will often go into short euphoric bouts where her awareness of her surroundings is completely overtaken.\n\n\"Clannad\" story revolves around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year high school student who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him to distance himself from others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.\n\nThe story opens on Monday April 14, 2003 at the beginning of the school year, when Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, a soft-spoken girl who is one year older than he is but is repeating her last year in high school due to being sick much of the previous year. Her goal is to join the drama club which she was unable to do due to her sickness, but they find that the drama club was disbanded after the few remaining members graduated. Since Tomoya has a lot of time to kill, he helps Nagisa in reforming the drama club. During this period, Tomoya meets and hangs out with several other girls whom he gets to know well and help with their individual problems.\n\nIn the second part of the story, which starts immediately after the end of the first part but extends into the next seven years, Tomoya and Nagisa start living together, and eventually get married. Tomoya has to endure several hardships that the family has been suffering from, especially Nagisa's illness. Just after Nagisa gives birth to their daughter Ushio, she dies, which causes Tomoya to become severely depressed. He is barely able to function, let alone look after an infant. As a result, Nagisa's parents, Akio and Sanae, take care of their granddaughter. Five years later, Tomoya meets with Shino Okazaki, his paternal grandmother. Shino tells Tomoya of his father's traumatic past, which is eerily similar to Tomoya's current situation. Afterwards, Tomoya resolves to raise Ushio and acknowledges Naoyuki as his father. Shortly after Tomoya overcomes his depression, Ushio is stricken with the same disease that Nagisa had. Tomoya, Sanae and Akio struggle to save her—Tomoya even quits his job—but all of their efforts turn out to be in vain. In the coming winter, wanting to do anything for his daughter, Tomoya takes her on a trip, but she dies shortly after.\n\nTomoya's psychology is developed in his dreams of a bleak world, called the , where small orbs of light float around. In the first few dreams, he sees a world devoid of all life, except for one girl. Each time he dreams, he finds out more about the world. Tomoya discovers that the girl has a special ability to fuse junk together to create new things, which she uses to create a body for him. Over time, Tomoya comes to the conclusion that only the two of them are \"alive\". To pass time, Tomoya and the girl try to build another doll with more junk they find, but as it has no soul, it fails to come to life. Remembering the distant world where he came from, Tomoya convinces the girl to build a ship so that the two can escape the approaching winter and continue to live a happy life. Eventually, winter sets in, and the girl becomes cold to the point where she cannot move any more. The girl tells Tomoya that he has another chance to go back and make things right. To do so, he must collect certain \"lights\" (symbols of happiness) similar to those floating around in the Illusionary World. If all the \"lights\" are collected throughout both story parts, a chance to save Nagisa from dying will become available, as well as the true ending, where she survives and lives with Tomoya and Ushio.\n\nThe executive producer for \"Clannad\" was Takahiro Baba from VisualArt's, the publishing company which controls Key. Jun Maeda, who was one of three main scenario writers with Kai, and Yūichi Suzumoto, led the planning for \"Clannad\" and wrote the majority of the scenarios. Scenario assistance was provided by Tōya Okano. Itaru Hinoue headed the art direction, and also worked on the character design. Miracle Mikipon, Mochisuke, Na-Ga, and Shinory supplemented the computer graphics. Torino provided the background art. The game's music was composed by Maeda, Shinji Orito, and Magome Togoshi.\n\nFor Key's second visual novel \"Air\", Maeda admitted he felt he was able to write what he wanted to for the game's scenario, but he later discovered that \"Air\" was difficult for players to receive and experience. Due to this, Maeda felt that for Key's next work \"Clannad\", he had a sense of duty to make the game easier to receive for as many users as possible. In any case, he wanted to make it an entertaining game, and started planning on \"Clannad\" almost immediately after \"Air\"s completion. From the start of \"Clannad\"s planning, Maeda did not want to write a story like in \"Air\", but instead wanted to focus on writing a deep connection between the 'people and the town', and 'humanity'. Maeda noted that he exceeded his writing ability when writing most of the scenarios in \"Clannad\", and equates \"Clannad\"s writing process as a \"wall that I will never be able to get over again.\" While at the beginning Maeda felt he was prepared, the entire game's story started to increase to a level Maeda never predicted, and Suzumoto noted that it approximately doubled in size from the original projected length. Suzumoto attributed the increase due to the lengthening structure of the game's base scenario which caused the 'branch' scenarios to increase as well.\n\nThere were more concerns about \"Clannad\" being similar to \"Air\". When Nagisa's scenario was being written, there were some disputes concerning the length of her scenario, and thus putting too much focus on the main heroine. Some were concerned that having a single prominent character with a unique storyline would be too much like how \"Air\" was structured with the overall focus on Misuzu Kamio. Takahiro Baba, the company president of VisualArt's, is even noted as suggesting to minimize the differences between the other characters' scenarios, but this was ultimately ignored since Maeda thought the game's evaluation by players would not decrease on account of the scenarios being vastly different, and thought the end result was a good one. Maeda was concerned that the After Story arc, mainly a continuation of Nagisa's scenario, would eclipse the entire game's scenario, much like what happened with \"Air\" according to Maeda. In order to prevent the same thing happening in \"Clannad\", Maeda focused on making the first half of the story, the School Life arc, just as enjoyable by making it long and heart-breaking. \"Clannad\" is Key's second longest work, as reported by Yūto Tonokawa where he stated that \"Clannad\" is about 4,000 words fewer than Key's 2008 game \"Little Busters! Ecstasy\".\n\nKey announced in 2001 a release date of 2002 for \"Clannad\" and, after several postponements, \"Clannad\" was released on April 28, 2004 as a limited edition version, playable on a Windows PC as a DVD. The limited edition came bundled with the remix album \"Mabinogi\" remixing background music tracks featured in the visual novel. The regular edition was released on August 6, 2004; While \"Clannad\" originally had no voice acting, Key released a version for Windows titled \"Clannad Full Voice\" on February 29, 2008 with full voice acting (except for Tomoya). \"Clannad Full Voice\" contained one new CG, and had updated support for Windows Vista PCs. \"Clannad Full Voice\" was re-released by Key under the name \"Clannad\" on July 31, 2009 in a box set containing five other Key visual novels called Key 10th Memorial Box. An updated version compatible for Windows 7 PCs titled \"Clannad Memorial Edition\" was released on May 28, 2010.\n\n\"Clannad\" was released for Windows on Steam by Sekai Project in English on November 23, 2015. In November 2014, Sekai Project used the crowdfunding website Kickstarter to raise funds to produce the English translation of \"Clannad\". After less than 24 hours, the project reached its goal of US$140,000. When the Kickstarter campaign reached its US$320,000 stretch goal, Sekai Project announced that they would also be translating and releasing the \"Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de\" side stories for Windows. Overall, the Kickstarter campaign raised US$541,161, exceeding all of its stretch goals. \"Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de\" was released on Steam on June 2, 2016.\n\nThe first consumer console port of the game was released for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) on February 23, 2006 by Interchannel. The PS2 version was re-released as a \"Best\" version on July 30, 2009. The PS2 version was bundled in a \"Key 3-Part Work Premium Box\" package together with the PS2 versions of \"Kanon\" and \"Air\" released on July 30, 2009. An Xbox 360 version was released on August 28, 2008 also by Prototype. A PlayStation 3 (PS3) version was released by Prototype on April 21, 2011. A downloadable version of the PS3 release via the PlayStation Store was released by Prototype on February 14, 2013.\n\nA version produced by NTT DoCoMo playable on FOMA mobile phones was released by Prototype through VisualArt's Motto in late 2007.

{"id": "10991589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10991589", "title": "Creoles of color", "text": "Creoles of color\n\nThe Creoles of color are a historic ethnic group of Creole people that developed in the former French and Spanish colonies of Louisiana (especially in the city of New Orleans), Southern Mississippi, Alabama, and Northwestern Florida in what is now the United States. French colonists in Louisiana first used the term \"Creole\" to refer to whites born in the colony, rather than in France. It was also used for slaves born in the colony.\n\nBut as a group of mixed-race people developed from unions between Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans, the term Creoles of color was applied to them. In some cases, white fathers would free their concubines and children, forming a class of \"Gens de couleur libres\" (free people of color). The French and Spanish gave them more rights than the slaves.\n\nMixed-race Creoles of color became identified as a distinct ethnic group, \"Gens de couleur libres\" (free persons of color), prior to the 19th century. During Louisiana's colonial period, \"Créole\" referred to people born in Louisiana whose ancestors had come from elsewhere; i.e., all natives other than Native Americans. The term \"Créole\" was first used by French colonists to distinguish themselves from foreign-born settlers, and later as distinct from Anglo-American settlers. Colonial documents show that the term \"Créole\" was used variously at different times to refer to white people, mixed-race people, and black people, including slaves.\n\nMany Creoles of color were free, and their descendants often enjoyed many of the same privileges that whites did, including (but not limited to) property ownership, formal education, and service in the militia. During the antebellum period, their society was structured along class lines and they tended to marry within their group. While it was not illegal, it was a social taboo for Creoles of color to marry slaves and it was a rare occurrence. Some of the wealthier and prosperous Creoles of color owned slaves themselves. Other Creoles of color, such as Thomy Lafon, used their social position to support the abolitionist cause.\n\nAnother Creole of color, wealthy planter Francis E. Dumas, emancipated all of his slaves in 1863 and organized them into a company in the Second Regiment of the Louisiana Native Guards, in which he served as an officer.\n\nSome historians suggest that New Orleans was the cradle of the civil rights movement in the United States, due to the earliest efforts of Creoles to integrate the military \"en masse\". Creoles of Color had been members of the militia for decades under both French and Spanish control of the colony of Louisiana. For example, around 80 free Creoles of Color were recruited into the militia that participated in the Battle of Baton Rouge in 1779.\n\nAfter the United States made the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and acquired the large territory west of the Mississippi, the Creoles of color in New Orleans volunteered their services and pledged their loyalty to their new country. They also took an oath of loyalty to William C. C. Claiborne, the Louisiana Territorial Governor appointed by President Thomas Jefferson.\n\nMonths after the colony became part of the United States, Claiborne's administration was faced with a dilemma previously unknown in the U.S.; integration in the military by incorporating entire units of previously established \"colored\" militia. In a February 20, 1804 letter, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn wrote to Claiborne saying, \"…it would be prudent not to increase the Corps, but to diminish, if it could be done without giving offense…\" A decade later, the militia of color that remained volunteered to take up arms when the British began landing troops on American soil outside of New Orleans in December 1814. This was the commencement of the Battle of New Orleans.\n\nAfter the Louisiana Purchase, many Creoles of color lost their favorable social status, despite their service to the militia and their social status prior to the U.S. takeover. The territory and New Orleans became the destination of many migrants from the United States, as well as new immigrants. Migrants from the South imposed their caste system. In this new caste system, all people with African ancestry or visible African features were classified as black, and therefore categorized as second class citizens, regardless of their education, property ownership, or previous status in French society. Former free Creoles of Color were relegated to the ranks of emancipated slaves. \n\nWith the advantage of having been better educated than the new freedmen, many Creoles of color were active in the struggle for civil rights and served in political office during Reconstruction, helping to bring freedmen into the political system. During late Reconstruction, white Democrats regained political control of state legislatures across the former Confederate states by intimidation of blacks and other Republicans at the polls. Through the late nineteenth century, they worked to impose white supremacy under Jim Crow laws and customs. They disfranchised the majority of blacks, especially by creating barriers to voter registration through devices such as poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, etc., stripping African Americans, including Creoles of color, of political power.\n\nCreoles of color were among the African Americans who were limited when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" in 1896, deciding that \"separate but equal\" accommodations were constitutional. It permitted states to impose Jim Crow rules on federal railways and later interstate buses.\n\nFinally, more than a century later, social change had reversed much of its two-century eclipse. On June 14, 2013 Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal signed into law Act 276, creating the \"prestige\" license plate stating \"I'm Creole\", in honor of the Creoles' contributions, culture, and heritage. In the 21st century, the term Louisiana Creole people, or Creole, generally refers to people of mixed-race and descendants of the early Catholic culture.\n\nSome Creoles of color trained as classical musicians in 19th-century Louisiana. These musicians would often study with those associated with the French Opera House; some traveled to Paris to complete their studies.

{"id": "10638474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10638474", "title": "Disorders of sex development", "text": "Disorders of sex development\n\nDisorders of sex development (DSD), sometimes referred to as disorders of sex differentiation or differences of sex development, are medical conditions involving the reproductive system. More specifically, these terms refer to \"congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical.\"\n\nThe term has been controversial, and research has shown that affected people experience a negative impact, with the terminology impacting choice and utilization of health care providers. The World Health Organization and many medical journals still reference DSDs as intersex traits or conditions. The Council of Europe, and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have called for a review of medical classifications that unnecessarily medicalize intersex traits.\n\nDSDs are medical conditions involving the way the reproductive system develops from infancy (and before birth) through young adulthood. There are several types of DSDs and their effect on the external and internal reproductive organs varies greatly.\n\nA frequently-used social and medical adjective for people with DSDs is \"intersex\". Parents with DSD children and clinicians involved in DSD treatment usually try to make clear distinctions between biological sex, social gender, and sexual orientation. This helps reduce confusion about the differences between being intersex, being transgender, and being gay/lesbian.\n\nThe most common DSD is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which results in a person with female (XX) chromosomes having genitals that look somewhat masculine. In mild cases, CAH results in a slightly enlarged clitoris, while in more severe cases it can be difficult to decide on observation whether a baby is male or female (ambiguous genitalia). CAH is caused by a problem with the adrenal glands and is usually treated by taking a daily medication to replace or supplement the missing adrenal hormones. (When this adrenal problem occurs in people with male (XY) chromosomes, the result is over-masculinization and premature puberty).\n\nAnother common DSD is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS),also known as testicular feminising syndrome in which a person with male (XY) chromosomes does not respond to testosterone in the usual way. This results in a body that to some degree has a feminine appearance. In complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) the result is a totally feminine appearance, including typical female breast development. Consequently, most young women with CAIS are unaware of their condition until the early teen years when they fail to menstruate. In the milder form, called partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), the genitals can vary from mostly female to almost completely male. Some people with PAIS think of themselves as women or girls, others regard themselves as men or boys, and some consider themselves nonbinary.\n\nOne of the more uncommon DSDs is 5-alpha-reductase deficiency (5ARD). It is caused by a shortage early in life of an enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT. DHT is required for the development of extrenal male genitilia. Therefore,In this condition, a person with male (XY) chromosomes has a body that appears female before puberty. After puberty begins, other testosterone-activating enzymes become available and the body soon takes on a masculine appearance, with the scrotum and penis usually reaching typical or nearly-typical size. If 5ARD is diagnosed at a young age, the child is often raised as a boy (a 1996 Brazilian study suggested that the majority of adults with this condition consider themselves men but this has been questioned in some more recent research).\n\nIn addition to CAH, CAIS, PAIS, and 5ARD there are several rarer types of DSDs, and in some cases, it is not possible to make a clear diagnosis of the underlying condition.\nThe penis (males) and clitoris (females) are essentially the same organ (differing only in size, and generically called the phallus). In typical males, the urethra is located at the tip of the penis, while in typical females the urethra is located below the base of the clitoris. When the phallus is of intermediate size, it is possible also to have a urethral opening located along the shaft; this condition is known as hypospadias which helps us raise a suspicion of DSD.\n\nOpen-minded parenting, appropriate and conservative medical intervention, and age-appropriate child involvement in the treatment plan contribute greatly to successful outcomes for the entire range of DSDs.\n\n\nThe term DSD (and particularly its association with medical \"disorders\") has been controversial. The argument over terminology reflects a deeper disagreement over the extent to which intersex conditions require medical intervention, the appropriateness of certain interventions, and whether physicians and parents should make irreversible treatment decisions on behalf of young children if the condition is not life-threatening.\n\n\nThe 2006 \"Consensus statement on management of intersex disorders\" stated that evidence for early surgery for cosmetic reasons is lacking, outcomes include \"decreased sexual sensitivity\" and long term outcome data is absent. A 2016 \"Global Disorders of Sex Development Update since 2006\" states that there is \"still no consensual attitude regarding indications, timing, procedure and evaluation of outcome of DSD surgery\" and \"no evidence regarding the impact of surgically treated or non-treated DSDs during childhood for the individual, the parents, society or the risk of stigmatization\".\n\nIn 2013, Juan E. Méndez, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, condemned \"irreversible sex assignment, involuntary sterilization, involuntary genital normalizing surgery, performed without their informed consent, or that of their parents, “in an attempt to fix their sex”\" stating that \"members of sexual minorities are disproportionately subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment because they fail to conform to socially constructed gender expectations\".\n\nIn May 2014, the World Health Organization issued a joint statement on \"Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement\" with the OHCHR, UN Women, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF. Referencing the involuntary surgical \"sex-normalising or other procedures\" on \"intersex persons\", the report recommends a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, ensuring non-discrimination, accountability and access to remedies.\n\nDuring 2015, the Council of Europe, and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights called for a review of medical classifications that unnecessarily medicalize intersex traits an end to medical interventions without consent, and improved disclosure. The Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner recommended:\nThe European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and UN Treaty Bodies have called for informed consent by individuals subjected to medical treatment, improved disclosure, and access to redress.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22117508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22117508", "title": "El Chal", "text": "El Chal\n\nEl Chal is a pre-Columbian Maya archaeological site located in the upper San Juan River valley of the southeastern Petén Basin region, Guatemala. The site is situated approximately to the north of the modern town of Dolores, near the contemporary village settlement of the same name, lying some to the south.\n\nEl Chal was occupied from approximately 300 BC through to 1300 AD (from the Late Preclassic through to the Early Postclassic Periods of Mesoamerican chronology), although some Middle Preclassic activity has been identified in the acropolis. The Late Preclassic occupation of the city was concentrated around an E-Group ceremonial complex some north of the later site core. The site's major period of occupation was during the Late Classic Period, when it was an important centre in the southeastern Petén region. Among the structures at the site is a large quadrangular residential complex, a structural type that is uncommonly found at Southern Maya lowland sites although there is a smaller one with similar characteristics at Machaquilá.\n\nEl Chal is located in the municipality of Dolores in the department of Petén in northern Guatemala. El Chal is south of Flores, the departmental capital. The archaeological site is within the southern area of a village also named El Chal, to the south of the highway to Flores. The site is situated in the central Petén wet savanna in a well-drained area not subject to seasonal flooding. The local topography is karstic in nature, and includes hills that support some of the city's architecture.\n\nEl Chal is located within the valley of the San Juan River, which is a tributary of the Pasión River, at an altitude of above mean sea level. The site is situated on a natural north-south communication route between the Maya Mountains and the central Petén region. This route was used during the Colonial Period and was likely to have been inherited from pre-Conquest times.\n\nSome of the major architecture of the site core is covered by secondary forest, including some large trees, while much of the city's remains lie within the modern village, including mounds of various sizes. Some mounds were destroyed in order to build the modern streets, in other cases the mounds were robbed of stone that was reused in modern construction. There are also instances where modern houses have been built on top of ancient mound platforms. Modern houses had previously also occupied the outskirts of the acropolis but were relocated during the Guatemalan Civil War in the late 20th century due to guerrilla activity.\nEl Chal was first occupied in the Middle Preclassic Period, with ceramics associated with a burial being recovered from the acropolis. Late Preclassic occupation has only been identified in a few residential groups in the site core. During the Preclassic the centre of the city was probably situated some distance to the northeast of the Late Classic centre, where a large ritual complex is located.\nThe major period of occupation at the site was during the Late Classic, when most of the major architecture was built. At this time the city centre was moved to the site core around the newly built acropolis complex. The sculpted monuments of the city indicate that it was important enough during the Late Classic to possess its own Emblem Glyph. The city experienced a period of intensive construction lasting from the Late Classic through to the Terminal Classic. All hieroglyphic texts sculpted on monuments at El Chal date to the 8th century AD, although the inscriptions are heavily eroded. The residential groups constructed upon platforms in Panorama Sector were built in the Late Classic, when a flint workshop was in production in Panorama Group 19. During the Late Classic occupation also expanded throughout the other sectors of the city; Arrepentimiento, Municipal and Central.\n\nDuring the Terminal Classic, El Chal maintained its primary place in the San Juan valley. This is evidenced by major building activity in the site core where the massive structures were underwent new phases of construction and by the erection of new monuments to accompany the already existing Late Classic monuments. The continued importance of El Chal in the Terminal Classic resulted in other centres in the region being eclipsed, such as El Edén and El Tigrillo to the west and Copoja, La Puente and El Ocote to the southeast. During the Terminal Classic, El Chal developed its own ceramic production industry.\n\nIn spite of the continued intensive activity in the site core, in Panorama Sector and the other peripheral residential sectors there was a diminishing of activity compared to the Late Classic, perhaps leading up to the abandonment of the city.\n\nPostclassic Period occupation of El Chal has been identified from ceramic fragments recovered from Structure 1 in the Northwest Plaza. A few Postclassic potsherds were also excavated from Group 15 in the Central Sector.\n\nThe name El Chal first appears on a Spanish Colonial watercolour from 1735 together with other villages in the region, with the name of El Chal or El Chacal. It also appears on a map of central and southeastern Petén from 1860, together with Poptún, Concepción, San Clemente and the ruins of Ixkun. Some of the stonework from the ruins has been stripped to be used in the construction of the modern village.\n\nThe site was visited by archaeologists Richard Kirsch and Ian Graham in 1974 and 1975 but their work was never published. In 1989 the Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala mapped the site and catalogued the remaining monuments. In 1993 the first test excavations took place and an area of around the site core was explored.\n\nIn the 1970s some sculpted monuments were removed from El Chal by FYDEP (\"Fomento y Desarrollo del Petén\" - \"Petén Patronage and Development\") and were later transferred to the Tikal National Park. By the mid-1990s the exact location and identity of these monuments had been lost.\n\nFurther excavations have taken place since the 1990s, including investigations of the West Plaza in 2003, the East Plaza in 2004, the acropolis in 2005–2006 and the Northwest Plaza in 2006.\n\nThe site core of El Chal consists of an acropolis and three ceremonial plazas in which the majority of sculpted monuments were found, the East Plaza, West Plaza and Northeast Plaza. There are also a number of other plazas in the site core. The plazas and the majority of the residential structures were laid out upon naturally level terrain, while the acropolis was built upon a natural limestone hill and a very few residential groups were built upon artificial basal platforms.\n\nA reservoir is located to the northwest of the acropolis. It was built with irregular limestone blocks and measures across. In the rain season it fills to a depth of and contains . A second, natural reservoir, is located to the south of the artificial reservoir and west of the acropolis. In the rain season it also fills to a depth of .\n\nThe large ritual complex of El Chal was located a considerable distance to the northeast of the civic centre of the city and was probably first built in the Preclassic Period.\n\nArchaeologists have mapped 268 structures clustered in 53 groups around approximately 68 patios in the site core. Residential structures were concentrated in the area surrounding the ceremonial centre, especially on the north and west sides near to the reservoir. Residences tended to be larger the closer they were to the reservoir. The residential area of El Chal was extensive and archaeologists have divided it into four sectors. Municipal consists of the area occupied by the modern village, El Arrepentimiento is the northeastern portion of the site, Panorama is the northwestern area, and Central is the site core. Central El Chal contains 25 groups, Arrepentimiento contains 40 groups, Panorama contains 53 groups and Municipal contains 18 groups. Panorama was an area of chert production while Municipal is associated with the ritual complex of the city.\n\nThe acropolis was built on a high limestone hill. The base is almost square, measuring on each side. The acropolis complex faced northwards onto the south side of the West Plaza. The upper part of the hill was levelled into three wide terraces with an average area of . The terraces were linked by a sunken stairway on the north side of the acropolis. The architecture of the acropolis is arranged in six groups.\n\nTerrace 1 is the highest terrace in the acropolis. It supports three small patios labelled as Patios A, B and C. These patios are laid out between 10 structures. Among the structures found on Terrace 1, Structures 1, 3, 5 and 6 have been excavated by archaeologists. Structure 5 is the largest, on the west side of Patio A. Terrace 1 has been dated to the Late and Terminal Classic. A complex stairway divided into three flights gave access to the terrace from the south side. The upper flight descended seven steps to a small room measuring . These steps had a tread of and a riser of . The second flight descended from the small room to another similar room, and the third flight descended in the opposite direction to the terrace supporting Patio F (Terrace 3). The wall of the upper flight was decorated with a sculpted bas-relief frame, the wall of the middle flight was coated with stucco and were painted with a red and black design.\nTerrace 2 is situated below Terrace 1. It is divided into two patios (Patios D and E) by a high pyramid temple. Patio D was accessed via a stairway from the West Plaza directly to the north, the stairway rose in two sections with a minor terrace between them, referred to as the Lower Terrace. The lower section of the stairway measured long, extending into the plaza at its lower end. Material excavated from the area around the stairway where it joined the base of the acropolis has been dated to the Late and Terminal Classic. Patio D itself was laid out at the very beginning of the Late Classic Period. It was resurfaced a number of times in the Late Classic, and the earliest of the surrounding structures were built at this time. Additional structures were built in the Terminal Classic, and the patio area was extended with the construction of the adjacent Patio G. Patio E was also accessed via a stairway from the base of the acropolis, although it is very poorly preserved. Ceramics recovered from the western portion of the Lower Terrace dated it to the Late and Terminal Classic. A low platform was excavated in the extreme southwestern corner of the Lower Terrace, although most of the ceramic finds were dated to the Terminal Classic, some pieces dating to the Late Preclassic were also found.\n\nTerrace 3 is located on the southwest side of the acropolis at the same height as Terrace 2. It supports one residential patio group, Patio F, formed by five structures.\n\nPatio A was formed by a group of 5 buildings serving a dual residential and administrative function. Evidence of this is the fact that the structures in the group were divided into multiple rooms with internal benches, a form of architecture that is recognised as being a palace and that may serve for either elite domestic or administrative activity. The stone blocks used in construction measured approximately on each side with a finely dressed front face, tapering towards the back in order to grip the structural fill. This patio is situated on the west side of the main terrace of the acropolis, Terrace 1. Patio A has an area of , with the largest building on the west side. Patio B lies to the east and Patio C to the west, a lower terrace supports Patio F to the southwest and Patio D to the north. The patio was accessed via a short 3-step stairway on the southeast side.\n\nExcavations identified 3 construction phases in Patio A, with the first two dating to the Late Classic and the final phase dating to the Terminal Classic.\nTerrace 1 Structure 1 is on the north side of Patio A. It consists of a long platform access via a wide stairway on the south side. The stairway had three steps, each with a tread of and a riser measuring . Structure 1 experienced two construction phases, in the Late Classic and in the Terminal Classic. In its final form it measured long by wide and stood high. The superstructure of the building possessed a C-shaped bench.\n\nTerrace 1 Structure 2 is on the northeast side of Patio A. It was a single level platform measuring by high. It was accessed via a projecting stairway measuring wide and protruding from the structure. The five steps each had a tread of and a riser measuring . Archaeologists were unable to investigate the summit of Structure 2 due to the large size of the trees growing upon it. The structure clearly shows two construction phases, the first dating to the Late Classic and the second to the Terminal Classic. Finds dating to the Middle Preclassic were recovered from trenches sunk into the patio in front of the structure, consisting of 378 potsherds associated with Burial 265. A Late Classic cache was also found at the base of the stairway, consisting of 2 eccentric obsidian artefacts shaped like centipedes, a flint arrowhead, various pieces of waste flint, and a number of flint blades and obsidian prismatic blades.\n\nTerrace 1 Structure 3 is on the east side of Patio A and separates it from Patio B. Structure 3 was built in two construction phases. The first phase was covered in stucco and raised above the level of the patio. The second phase consisted of a square platform that was high. A bench on the east side of the platform raised the height to above the floor of the patio. Structure 3 was built from small limestone blocks around a rubble core. In its final form the structure was a rectangular platform measuring and standing high. The stairway measured wide and was divided into two by a block. The platform supported a bench measuring . An incomplete human skeleton was found next to the south wall (Burial 73), together with broken ceramic fragments dating to the Terminal Classic. Although material excavated from the two construction phases has been dated to the Late Preclassic and the Early Classic, this material is believed to have been transported there and used as infill during the Late Classic construction of the building and not to represent earlier phases of the structure itself.\n\nTerrace 1 Structure 4 is on the south side of Patio A. The earliest version of the building measured . It supported a room that measured with three doorways. The central door was wide and the flanking doorways measured wide. The front of the building was dominated by a bench that ran the entire width of the structure and became a wide stairway descending to the patio and extending from the platform. The stairway had 3 steps, each with a height of and a tread of . The first construction phase included a high wall that was later covered by the stucco floor of a small north-facing room. On the east side of the structure, the walls were still found to stand to a height of . Structure 4 was deliberately demolished in antiquity. The second construction phase extended the building to a size of . It supported three rooms with benches, the combined width of the rooms was by . The same three doors from the earlier phase continued in use.\n\nTerrace 1 Structure 5 is on the west side of Patio A. It consists of a single platform that is the highest in the entire acropolis. It measures and was high. Structure 5 was joined to Structures 1 and 4 since its earliest phase of construction. Structure 5 was accessed by a projecting stairway that ascended the east side, it measured wide and protruded from the platform. The stairway joins a \"talud\" wall topped by a high cornice that projects from the \"talud\" wall. The walls of Structure 5 were built from finely dressed limestone blocks. No trace of any superstructure was found on top of the platform, nor was any earlier substructure identified. Only the lowest courses of limestone blocks were found to be still in place and it is believed that the upper courses were stripped in antiquity. Finds made near the southeast corner of Structure 5 include a piece of a greenstone axe, two spherical stones, pieces of human bone (labelled as Burial 70) and a concentration of broken domestic ceramics. These finds are believed to represent activity from the very end of the Terminal Classic prior to the abandonment of the site. Burial 278, that of an infant, was found under the floor of Structure 5 and was dated to the Late Classic.\n\nPatio B was filled with a large amount of rubble in order to bring it up to the same level as the pre-existing Patio A, which lies immediately to the west. It is an enclosed courtyard with an area of . Three structures were built upon the new patio, closing it on the north, east and south sides, while the west side was enclosed by Structures 1,2 and 3 of Patio A.\n\nTerrace 1 Structure 6 is on the south side of Patio B. It is a square platform with two stepped levels. After the last phase of construction it had two benches on the top and a wide projecting stairway on the north side, it measures wide. The structure measures , the first bench measures and the second . Various human bone fragments, representing pieces of three individuals, were excavated together with domestic ceramics. A smaller second stairway jutted from the southeast corner of the building. Structure 6 has been dated to the Late and Terminal Classic.\n\nTerrace 1 Structure 7 is a low platform on the east side of Patio B. It measured and stood high. Upon the platform was a wide bench, and a single wide step lead down to the patio. Excavations of the platform uncovered material that was dated to the Late Preclassic, Late Classic and Terminal Classic. Structure 7 was the last to be built on Patio B, postdating the construction of Structures 6 and 8.\n\nTerrace 1 Structure 8 is on the north side of Patio B. It is a rectangular platform measuring with a wide south-facing embedded stairway. The structure was not completely explored due to the dense vegetation covering it.\n\nPatio C was added to Terrace 1 at the same time as Patio B, using a large amount of rubble to extend the terrace. It is to the northwest of Patio A and is slightly lower than it. Patio C is bordered by 2 structures, on the north and west sides, with the West Structure being the largest. The fill beneath the patio has a depth of , which was previously the height of the retaining \"talud\" wall of the northwest side of Patio A, as found during excavations. Patio C had 2 construction phases and served an administrative function directly associated with the buildings of Patio A.\n\nThe West Structure contained a wide room accessed via a wide doorway. The rear room of the structure contained a bench, or throne, that measured and stood high. Material recovered from the structure has been dated to the Late and Terminal Classic Periods, with a small amount dating to the Postclassic.\n\nThe North Structure was a low platform that was covered with stucco and painted red.\n\nTerrace 2 Structure 1 is on the north side of Patio D. It is a low rectangular platform measuring high. Its walls rest upon the last surface layer of the patio and the structure's surface was littered with abundant Terminal Classic ceramic remains. A sunken stairway climbed the structure at a point from the southeast corner. The tread of the steps measured deep while the risers measured high. During the Late Classic this structure apparently had an administrative function. However, by the Terminal Classic it was used as a domestic building, as evidenced by the abundant ceramics and stone artefacts recovered, the latter include a fragment of a \"metate\" milling stone, an obsidian knife and two flint knives.\nTerrace 2 Structure 2 is on the east side of Patio D. It was a tall pyramidal platform that did not possess a summit superstructure. The upper east side of the pyramid has collapsed and looters' trenches on the west side were filled in by IDAEH in 1991. The walls possessed \"taluds\" and excavations uncovered traces of red paint. The stairway faced west onto Patio D, the treads measured and the risers . The stairway projected into the patio from the pyramid. A burial cist was found near the front of the pyramid, it was labelled as Burial 264 and was dated to the Late Classic. The platform had five layers of stucco flooring. Material recovered during excavation of the stairway dated to the Terminal Classic.\n\nTerrace 2 Structure 3 encloses the west side of Patio D. Structure 3 does not face onto Patio D but rather is part of the Terminal Classic construction activity that extended Terrace 2 with the addition of Patio G. The structure measured from east to west. Excavated artefacts around the base have been dated to the Late and Terminal Classic. The stairway is on the west side, facing onto Patio G. The structure is believed to have been built in a single burst of activity in the Terminal Classic. It had two stepped levels and a north-south stairway was identified upon the summit of the structure.\n\nPatio F is on a terrace at the same level as Patios D and E. The patio is a closed courtyard formed by 5 structures on the west and south sides, while the other two sides are formed by the retaining walls of Patios A and C. The structures were residential buildings built upon low platforms, with the principal structure on the south side of the patio. A long, low platform on the west side supports two structures, labelled as Structures 1 and 2. Excavations of this platform recovered ceramic remains dating to the Late and Terminal Classic.\n\nStructure 1 measures north-south by east-west and was built upon the same platform that supports Structure 2. The structure had a single room measuring , which contained a bench.\n\nStructure 2 is to the south of Structure 1, resting upon the same basal platform. It measured with a room measuring .\n\nStructure 3 was built directly upon Patio F, and is therefore lower than Structures 1 and 2. It was on the southwest side of Patio F and measured and had a wide projecting stairway extending from the facade. Ceramics from the structure were largely dated to the Terminal Classic, with a few pieces dating to the Postclassic.\n\nStructure 4 was located on the south side of Patio F. Ceramics from the structure were dated to the Terminal Classic.\n\nThe East Plaza covers an area of , making it the largest open ceremonial space in the entire city. On its east side it is delimited by 2 medium-height structures (East Plaza Structures 1 and 2), on the south side by the base of the acropolis, on the west side by Structure 3 of the West Plaza and on the north side by the South Structure of the Northeast Plaza. Six stelae and three altars were found in the East Plaza. The plaza had two construction phases, the first dated to the Late Classic and the second to the Terminal Classic. A few Late Preclassic ceramic fragments were also recovered. The levelling of the East Plaza involved a considerable inversion of labour due to the limestone bedrock being extremely close to the surface at one side and under the surface at the other.\n\nEast Plaza Structure 1 is on the east side of the plaza. In its final form it was a platform with two levels standing to a total height of . It measured north-south by east-west. The structure had a wide stairway climbing from the plaza on the west side, the stairway was long. The lower level was the main platform. It was built from finely dressed limestone blocks. The upper level was built of very poor quality limestone and is extremely badly preserved. A bench was built on top of the structure. It measured with a protruding section measuring . The bench was high. A large number of flint chippings were excavated from the structure. They have been dated to the Late Classic.\n\nEast Plaza Structure 2 is also on the east side of the plaza. It is a rectangular platform measuring and facing westwards onto the plaza itself. A stairway climbs the west side of the building. It measures . The platform supports a bench measuring . The broken remains of Stela 6 are scattered in front of the structure. Relatively few ceramic remains were found associated with this structure. Those that were have been dated to the Terminal Classic, although a pit sunk into the summit uncovered remains dating to the Late Classic at a depth of . Lithic artefacts included a piece of an obsidian knife.\n\nThe West Plaza covers an area of . The south side of the plaza is formed by the north side of the acropolis and the plaza is also enclosed by four structures that measure more than high. The highest structure is on the west side and measures high. A series of three steps stretched between the north wall of Structure 4 and the southwest corner of Structure 1 and gave access to the Northwest Plaza. These steps had a tread and were high. Six monuments were found in the West Plaza. During the final phase of occupation during the Terminal Classic, refuse found at the base of the acropolis indicates that the West Plaza was occupied as a residential area, with the inhabitants using flimsy perishable structures.\n\nWest Plaza Structure 1 is on the north side of the West Plaza, near the northwest corner. The structure faces southwards onto the plaza and has a stairway that measures climbing the front of the building. The final version of the structure measured . A bench on the summit of the structure measures . The structure has two phases of construction, the earliest of which dates to the Late Classic.\n\nWest Plaza Structure 2 is on the north side of the West Plaza. It is a rectangular platform measuring with a projecting stairway on the south side that measures . It is the only building on the West Plaza that did not possess a bench upon the summit. A number of potsherds dating to the Terminal Classic were recovered from the front of the platform.\nWest Plaza Structure 3 is on the east side of the West Plaza and separates it from the East Plaza. It is a rectangular building with a wide stairway climbing from the west. The structure measures and possesses a bench on the summit that measures . After its final construction phase the platform stood high. A pit sunk into the structure revealed the presence of two earlier substructures. The first was high and the second stood high. All three stages were filled with a rubble core, although the earliest stage consisted of larger pieces than the latter stages. Various artefacts were recovered from the southwest corner of the final stage of the stairway, including pieces of flint, obsidian blades, \"metates\" (milling stones) and a large amount of domestic ceramics.\n\nWest Plaza Structure 4 is on the west side of the West Plaza and is the tallest structure at El Chal. The platform measures north-south and east-west; it has a rectangular base that was formed of three stepped sections. The lowest section measured high with a wide platform between its upper edge and the beginning of the second section. The middle section was high with a platform between its upper edge and the base of the upper section. The wall of the top section is poorly preserved with just two courses of stonework remaining in place. The sides of the structure have largely collapsed due to erosion, leaving the north side as the best preserved. The stairway has not been positively identified but is believed to be a wide sunken stairway on the east side. The broken fragments of Stela 1 were found at the base of this stairway.\n\nThe platform supported a long superstructure facing onto the West Plaza, as evidenced by the bases of its walls. Originally the superstructure consisted of a single, long room but this was later subdivided; another room to the south was probably demolished at the same time. The floor of the superstructure is above the level of the West Plaza. The walls were thick and the entrance doorway measured wide. This superstructure was divided into five rooms, each measuring . These rooms were completely sealed, and in some cases destroyed, by a layer of compact white soil during the Terminal Classic. The rooms were upon a low platform upon the summit and were accessed from the upper section of the basal platform via three steps measuring wide, with a tread of and a height of . Stucco fragments with traces of pigment indicate that the rooms were once painted.\n\nRoom 1 was extremely poorly preserved and is the southernmost of the rooms. Only one doorjamb and a portion of wall belonging to a rear bench were found during excavations.\n\nRoom 2 is one of the best preserved of the rooms atop Structure 4. It measured north-south by east-west. The doorway to the room was wide. The room has been dated to the Terminal Classic.\n\nRoom 3 is the middle room of the superstructure. It was the only room not to have been sealed during the Terminal Classic and due to this is in a poor state of preservation. The room possessed a bench against the back wall the measured in height and wide.\n\nRoom 4 was well preserved and is very similar to Room 5. It measured north-south by east-west, the door was wide. The bench of the room measured high by thick.\n\nRoom 5 is of identical proportions as rooms 2 and 4. It was extremely well preserved, including the rear wall of the bench and the room was used as a model for investigations of the other rooms in Structure 4.\n\nSome artefacts were recovered from the northeastern portion of the structure. They included fragments of a \"metate\" and of a \"manos\" (handstone for use with a \"metate\") and a large quantity of domestic ceramics. Stela 1 and Altar 7 were found in front of Structure 4.\n\nThe Ballcourt is on the north side of the West Plaza. It runs north-south and measures long by wide. The sides of the ballcourt measure approximately high. These side structures supported rectangular stone benches. The west structure has been damaged by a looters' trench and originally had a stairway that climbed the west side. Sculpted blocks of stone were found on the benches of both side structures and once decorated the aprons of the ballcourt. The four surviving blocks bear geometric designs and parts of sculpted figures deity masks. The stucco floor at the south end of the ballcourt was found to be well preserved. The ballcourt has been dated to the Late Classic Period.\n\nThe Northeast Plaza covers an area of . It is located to the north of the East Plaza. The Northeast Plaza is enclosed by four structures of similar size and form and was accessed from the northeast corner. The tallest structure measures high. The four buildings completely enclose an area measuring . These four structures consist of stepped rectangular platforms and were built from finely dressed limestone blocks. Excavations revealed remains of the superstructure of the tallest structure, including rooms with different entrance doorways. Construction at the plaza dates to the Late Classic period.\n\nNortheast Plaza Structure 2 has a rectangular base. The structure is believed to have had three stepped levels that were built with finely dressed stone blocks, some of which were decorated with a double-trapezoid design. Some of the blocks were found to have a thin coating of cream-coloured stucco. The rear of the structure has the form of a truncated pyramid. The stairway and the upper parts of the structure were deliberately destroyed in antiquity, leaving only the lower courses of stonework in place. The southeastern portion of the platform is the best preserved, where a \"talud\" wall stands to a height of . Structure 2 is believed to have faced onto the Northeast Plaza. Ceramic remains were found on the east side of the platform and also where Structure 2 joins Structure 4. Excavations of the upper platform revealed five layers of stucco flooring, all dating to the Late Classic. Burial 67 was found deposited in a cist under the second layer, its location had been marked on that floor with a painted red circle. Upon the top of the platform were found traces of a small ( wide) room with doorways facing the east and west. The walls were thick and their remains stand to a height of . The floor of the room slopes noticeably down to the east.\n\nThe Northwest Plaza covers an area of . It is enclosed by two structures, the largest of which is a pyramid on the west side. No monuments were found within the Northwest Plaza. The plaza occupies a privileged position at the centre of the city although it does not have a high concentration of structures. Three construction levels have been identified within the Northwest Plaza, all of them date to the Late Classic.\n\nNorthwest Plaza Structure 1 has a rectangular base measuring east-west by north-south and standing high. The lowest level of the platform body has an inclining \"talud\" wall. A wide stairway projects from the wall of the structure. The stairways was built during the earliest construction phase of the plaza, rising from the lowest plaza level. After the second surfacing of the plaza an unusual inclining \"talud\"-style dado was added to the stairway. At the same time a small bench-type structure was attached to the west side of the platform in order to widen the lower level of the building. The small blocks used in this extension contrast with the large, finely dressed blocks used in the main structure. Potsherds recovered from the structure mainly represent Late to Terminal Classic utilitarian wares, with additional fragments representing a Postclassic occupation of the structure.\n\nNorthwest Plaza Structure 2 is a high pyramid on the west side of the plaza. Its base measures . The architectural quality of the pyramid was poor, as demonstrated by the small, irregular blocks used in construction, and it has been badly damaged by the collapse of its sides. These blocks average on each side. The pyramid has also been damaged by a looters' pit on the west side of the structure. Architectural detail has been largely obliterated by the pyramid's poor state of preservation, but inset corners have been identified on the north and south sides. Surface ceramic finds all date to the Terminal Classic. Artefacts recovered include portions of a ceramic incense burner and broken obsidian prismatic blades.\n\nSoutheast Plaza Structure 1 is a rectangular platform with at least two levels. It has been dated to the Late Classic Period.\n\nGroup 13 and Group 15 are located just outside the protected archaeological zone, opposite the custodian's house. Group 15 is situated immediately north of Group 13 and some structures are shared by both groups. Ceramic fragments recovered from the two groups have been dated to the Late Preclassic, Late Classic, Terminal Classic and Postclassic, with the majority dating to the Terminal Classic.\n\nGroup 15 Structure 2 is a rectangular platform with a projecting stairway. It measures with a projecting stairway that measures . A few domestic ceramics were recovered during excavations.\n\nGroup 15 Structure 5 was found to have a midden near the northwest corner from which were excavated a large amount of Terminal Classic potsherds together with a few pieces dating to the Postclassic Period.\n\nThis group is a residential group to the northeast of the site core. Four low structures were built upon a basal platform, largely clustered on the east side. The plaza area had an area of . The plaza had two construction phases, the earliest dating to the Late Preclassic Period and the second to the Late Classic. Burial 68 was found in the centre of the plaza, under the earlier floor level.\n\nGroup 18 Structure 1 is on the north side of the plaza. It was severely damaged when a modern street was laid out, cutting through its north side. Only the south wall remains.\n\nGroup 18 Structure 2 is on the east side of the plaza. Its earliest phase dates to the Late Preclassic. The Preclassic remains consist of a low north wall running east-west. A later construction phase was built over this. It consisted of a rectangular platform that supported a bench. A small pyrite disc was found near the front wall. Obsidian prismatic blades were found on top of the platform, together with pieces of a thin earthenware bowl. Burial 69 was found in front of the base of the platform.\n\nGroup 18 Structure 3 is a rectangular platform located on the south side of the plaza. The core consists of large pieces of rubble that suggest some kind of older substructure. The platform has been dated to the Late Classic.\n\nGroup 18 Structure 4 is situated on the west side of the plaza.\n\nThis group is located to the north of the reservoir. The layout of the group is difficult to discern due to destruction caused by the construction of a street, although two low structures survive. Group 21 is distinguished by being the only group outside of the ceremonial centre of the city to possess stone monuments, the badly eroded Stela 10 and Altar 6.\n\nThe various minor residential groups, including Groups 7 through to 12, were formed by clusters of very small structures with platforms not exceeding in height. Groups 4 to 6, 13 to 17, 20 to 24, 26 and 52 all date to the Late and Terminal Classic. Late Preclassic ceramics were recovered from Group 23.\n\nThe Municipal Sector is the area north of the highway running from Flores to Dolores. Part of this sector actually falls within the municipality of Santa Ana. Eighteen residential groups have been mapped in this sector. These residential groups are clustered around a group of larger structures forming an E-Group ceremonial complex, located from the site core.\n\nThe E-Group consists of a number of structures around a small plaza. These include a pyramid at the west side, a long structure on the east side supporting an upper platform and two smaller structures on the north and south sides. The E-Group was first built in the Late Preclassic Period, it was lightly occupied during the Early Classic and was then expanded with the addition of two structures in the Late Classic. By this time major activity at El Chal had been transferred to the area around the acropolis, leaving the once central E-Group on the periphery.\n\nThe East Platform of the E-Group has produced ceramics dating to the Late Preclassic, Early Classic and Late Classic. The East Platform was built from limestone blocks and was accessed via a stairway at the rear of the building that projected . This stairway climbed a wide projection from the rear of the building. The east platform does not support the usual lateral structures found at E-Groups, with the Central Platform being the only upper platform upon the basal platform.\n\nThe Central Platform of the E-Group is situated upon the middle section of the East Platform. It has produced ceramics dated to the Late Preclassic. The platform has a total height of .\n\nThe West Pyramid of the E-Group produced ceramic evidence dating the Late Preclassic, Early Classic and Late Classic. Although the limestone blocks used for its construction are very poorly preserved, the West Pyramid is believed to have been a radial pyramid dating to the Late Preclassic Period.\n\nThe North Structure of the E-Group has not been securely dated but is believed to date to the Late Classic, based on comparisons with E-Groups at other Maya cities.\n\nThe South Structure of the E-Group has not been securely dated but is also believed to have been built in the Late Classic.\n\nThe Arrepentimiento Sector is located beside the highway running from El Chal to Santa Elena. It contains about 40 groups of structures concentrated upon karstic hills, with lesser occupation in low-lying areas. Settlement extends northwards from the highway for about until the dry riverbed of the Río El Chal. The majority of the architectural groups are located among cattle pasture. Some of the groups have been heavily looted, mostly those groups covered by dense vegetation. Those groups in open pasture have not been subject to looting but have suffered from the stripping of their stonework in order to use it in modern construction.\n\nThe arhcitectural groups of the Arrepentimiento Sector are residential in nature, with low platforms measuring between high laid out around patios with alignments of uncut stones. The structures in these groups date to the Late Classic.\n\nThe North Mound of Group 1 and the South Mound of Group 2 are the only structures that are greater than in height.\n\nThis sector is located within the lands owned by Finca Panorama, some from El Chal along the highway towards Santa Elena. The altitude is very close to that of the site core, averaging above mean sea level. Panorama Sector occupies an area of cattle pasture with very few trees but a great many Corozo Palms, the fruit of which is used locally to produce vegetable oil. The northern part of the sector possesses a number of hills upon which residential groups were built, while towards the south the land descends towards an area of unoccupied seasonal swamps. Panorama Sector possesses 53 architectural groups, 34 of which are in the periphery, together with a causeway.\n\nOf the ceramic fragments recovered from Panorama Sector, 374 pieces have been dated to the Late Classic, representing 62% of the total ceramics found in the sector. The vast majority of these are domestic in nature. 234 pieces were dated to the Terminal Classic, representing the remaining 38%.\n\nGroup 4 is located west of Group 1. It consists of three structures arranged around a courtyard that is open on the south side. Structure 1 is the largest structure in the group. Structures 2 and 3 have been looted. The group has been dated to the Late Classic Period.\n\nGroup 5 is southwest of Group 1. It consists of three structures laid out around a patio that is open of the east side. Group 5 is dated to the Late Classic.\n\nGroup 6 is south of Group 1. Like Group 5 it consists of three structures laid out around a courtyard that is open on the east side. Group 6 is dated to the Late Classic.\n\nGroup 7 is located on a hillside to the east of Group 15. It consists of five structures completely enclosing a patio. Structure 1, on the north side, and Structure 5, on the west side, are the largest structures in the group. Structures 1, 2 and 3 have all been looted. Group 7 dates to the Late Classic Period.\n\nGroup 9 is south of Group 7. It consists of 5 structures, four of them are small while the west structure is larger. This group is dated to the Late Classic.\n\nGroup 10 is on a hillside to the southeast of Group 9. It consists of four structures forming an enclosed patio group and dates to the Late Classic.\n\nGroup 15A is located on an artificial platform formed by levelling a natural elevation. The group is formed of six structures, four of these are large and enclose a patio. Two smaller structures are located to the southeast and southwest. The group has been looted, recovered ceramics date to the Late and Terminal Classic.\n\nGroup 15B is situated on the south side of the same artificial platform that supports Groups 15A and 15C.\n\nGroup 15C is situated at the south end of the same artificial platform that supports Group 15A. It is composed of three structures arranged around a patio that is open on the north side. Group 15C has been dated to the Late Classic.\n\nGroup 16 has not been excavated but is notable for a long causeway running north-south past its plaza. The causeway is wide and bordered by high parapets. The original length of the causeway has not been determined. The plaza itself is bordered by the remains of walls that stand high.\n\nGroup 19 consists of three structures laid out around a patio that is open on the south side. The group has been tentatively identified as a stone workshop due to the great quantity of waste product found there, and it may have produced flint cores. Group 19 has been dated to the Terminal Classic. Stela 19 and Altar 9 were found east of Group 9. They are the only monuments that have been found in Panorama Sector.\n\nNineteen carved stone monuments were originally found at El Chal, all of which are badly eroded. Various monuments are broken into fragments. Only five stelae and three altars bore sculpted designs. The stelae exhibit a variety of forms but all the altars are circular. None of the hieroglyphic texts found on the monuments of El Chal have yet been deciphered. The sculptural style of the monuments is similar to that of 8th century monuments from Sacul, Ucanal and Naranjo.\n\nStela 1 was found at the west side the West Plaza, at the base of Structure 4. It was associated with Altar 7. The stela is broken into various fragments and was sculpted with a rectangular frame containing the portrait of a standing person with an elaborate feathered headdress, holding a staff in his right hand. The figure is accompanied by a vertical hieroglyphic panel containing a calendrical date. The text is badly eroded but the numbers 10 and 13 can be read. The stela was resting upon the last construction phase of the plaza. Stela 1 measured high by wide and was thick. The best preserved fragment, that possessing the sculpted portrait, was moved to the Museo Regional del Sureste de Petén (\"Southeastern Petén Regional Museum\") in Dolores in 2005. This fragment measured high by wide and was thick. Five stela fragments were left where they had fallen, they contained parts of the frame and of the feathered headdress. The central pieces of the stela were not found during the excavations that took place in 2004 and 2005.\n\nStela 2 was found in centre of the West Plaza. The butt of this stela was found in its original location, although the shaft has broken and fallen backwards. Stela 2 does not appear to have had any sculpted designs or text. It was associated with Altar 1.\n\nStela 3 was found in the West Plaza. Stela 3 was originally erected at the base of Structure 3. It was sculpted with a rounded frame containing the figure of a person facing left and accompanied by a badly eroded and completely illegible hieroglyphic text. Stela 3 had been moved from its original location and was associated with Altar 2.\nStela 4 was found in the northern part of the East Plaza. It was the only monument at El Chal to have been sculpted on both sides and had been moved from its original location. Due to its sculptural style and its location, it is believed to have been associated with Altars 3 and 4. The upper portion of the front of the stela bears a hieroglyphic text with a calendrical date that has been interpreted as 9.16.10.0.0. 1 Ahau 3 Zip (17 March 761) together with the site's Emblem Glyph. This side of the stela depicts a Maya bloodletting ritual with a richly dressed person standing with legs apart standing on top of three sitting prisoners, the middle of which bears his own name written upon his left leg. The principal figure bears a spear topped by a serpent head with a flint spearhead emerging from it. This spear is very similar in style to one depicted on Stela 8 at Naranjo. The reverse of the stela depicts three individuals standing upon a monster mask seen in profile. A child or youth is seated before two adult figures. All of them wear rectangular headdresses and hold something in their hands that cannot now be distinguished. Hieroglyphic texts are carved above the heads of the two standing figures and probably represent their names. The sculptural style of the two sides is different, and the foot-level of the standing figures on each side is different, with the figures on the reverse being positioned higher up the shaft than the figure on the front. This probably indicates that both sides were sculpted in situ at different times, with the reverse of the stela being crafted after the floor level of the plaza had risen to cover the base of the front side.\nStela 5 was situated at the base of Structure 1 in the East Plaza. It was carved with a rounded frame containing a figure in profile facing to the left. The figure is standing with the legs together and is wearing a feathered headdress and bears a zoomorphic head on its back, from which hang more feathers. The hands of the figure are extended forward and appear to bear a staff of rulership. The stela bears a hieroglyphic panel with an incomplete dedicatory date that must fall within the range from December 740 to November 805. The text also contains the name of the king who dedicated the stela, Shield Jaguar, and the Emblem Glyph of El Chal.\n\nStela 6, Stela 7, Stela 8 and Stela 9 are all either fragments or butts of stelae that were removed in the 1970s by FYDEP and are now lost. All of these stelae fragments are situated in the southern half of the East Plaza, with Stela 6 to the east and Stela 9 to the west.\n\nStela 6 is broken into multiple pieces that are scattered at the base of East Plaza Structure 2. It was a plain limestone monument.\n\nStela 10 was found in Group 21 together with Altar 6. They are among the very few monuments that were placed outside of the ceremonial centre of the city. Stela 10 was carved with a frame containing a figure, now badly eroded. The figure is standing with feet separated and turned outwards. Small hieroglyphic panels accompany it. Stela 10 had been moved from its original location, which was probably somewhere nearby.\n\nStela 11 was found at the base of one of the structures in the Southeast Plaza, it was a plain monument. Stela 11 has fallen and is lying on its back.\n\nStela 12 was found with Altar 9 some east of Group 19 and south of the highway to Flores, in Panorama Sector. They are the only monuments to have been found in Panorama Sector. Stela 12 is a plain monument sculpted from limestone. It has fallen from its upright position and is half buried. It is broken in the middle and measures long by wide by thick.\n\nAltar 1 was found in centre of the West Plaza, together with Stela 2. This altar was found in its original location. It was a plain monument.\n\nAltar 2 was found in the West Plaza, where it was associated with Stela 3 at the base of Structure 3. Altar 2 was a plain monument and had been moved from its original location.\n\nAltar 3 was found in the northern part of the East Plaza, where it was associated with Stela 4. It was sculpted although it is now badly eroded. It bears the images of two seated anthropomorphic figures but further details cannot be distinguished.\nAltar 4 is a circular monument. It was also found in the northern part of the East Plaza and was associated with Stela 4. It depicts three seated prisoners, the central figure is facing to the left while the other two are facing inwards towards him. Hieroglyphic texts are carved underneath the prisoners and upon the sides of the altar. The altar has been dated on stylistic grounds to the latter part of the 8th century AD.\n\nAltar 5 was found in the East Plaza. It has been broken into various pieces and is badly eroded but is believed to have been sculpted with a scene similar to that represented on Altar 4.\n\nAltar 6 is a plain monument that was found in Group 21 together with Stela 10. Like its associated stela it had been moved from its original location in antiquity but was probably not moved far.\n\nAltar 7 was found in the West Plaza at the base of Structure 4 together with Stela 1. The altar is plain, without sculpted figures or text and rests upon the last construction phase of the plaza. It was circular and measured in diameter and was high. It is broken in three parts.\n\nAltar 8 was found in its original location in the Southeast Plaza. It was a plain altar without signs of being sculpted. The monument is badly cracked.\n\nAltar 9 was found with Stela 12 in Panorama Sector, near Group 19. It is located from one end of Stela 12 and is also a plain monument. It is a circular altar, broken in fragments and half buried. It measures in diameter and thick. Only the upper are exposed.\n\nAltar 11 was found in its original location.\n\nAltar 19 was found in its original location.\n\nBurial 67 was found in a cist under the second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The skeleton was lying on its back with the head towards the north. The remains were poorly preserved but belonged to an adult. Of the skull only some dental remains were found. A ceramic plate had been placed under the head of the deceased and another plate was placed upon the knees. The plate was painted with four seated anthropomorphic figures with inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws. The facial features of the figures are unusual. The bottom of the plate bears the image of a dancer. The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.\n\nBurial 68 was found in the centre of the Group 18 plaza. The corpse was poorly preserved, it was laid out on its back with the skull towards the north. The remains were covered with small pieces of limestone mixed with brown soil. A piece of the upper jaw indicated that the remains were those of a child aged between 5 and 10 years old. Four ceramic pieces were deposited as an offering; two plates, an earthenware bowl and a bowl. Burial 68 is dated to the Late Preclassic.\n\nBurial 69 was found in front of the base of Group 18 Structure 2. The remains were extremely poorly preserved but the deceased may have been laid out on their back with the head towards the north. Associated funerary offerings included a tripod plate, a polychrome vase and a flint projectile point. The burial was securely dated to the Late Classic.\n\nBurial 264 was found in a cist under the earliest level of the stucco flooring of Terrace 2 Structure 2, a pyramid on the acropolis. The cist was built from stone slabs and measured by . The human remains consist of some skull fragments and some pieces of the longbones, with the skull at the east end. The offering consisted of a ceramic pot with lid dated to the Late Classic period.\n\nBurial 265 was found at the base of the stairway of Terrace 1 Structure 2 in the acropolis. Ceramics associated with the burial have been dated to the Middle Preclassic Period. This burial is the only evidence yet found of such early activity at the site. It consists of the burial of a seated infant together with a newborn. The burial was laid out upon a layer of large stones and was accompanied by a plate and other ceramics as a funerary offering. The child's skull was found underneath the plate itself. Burnt stones and earth were found next to the burial.\n\nBurial 278 was that of an infant, deposited in a cist under the floor of Terrace 1 Structure 5 in the acropolis. It was unaccompanied by any offering, the few ceramic fragments found associated with the cist were dated to the Late Classic Period. The remains were laid out on their back, with the skull oriented to the south.\n"}
{"id": "2545484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2545484", "title": "English in computing", "text": "English in computing\n\nThe English language is sometimes described as the \"lingua franca\" of computing. In comparison to other sciences, where Latin and Greek are the principal sources of vocabulary, computer science borrows more extensively from English. Due to the technical limitations of early computers, and the lack of international standards on the Internet, computer users were limited to using English and the Latin alphabet. However, this historical limitation is less present today. Most software products are localized in numerous languages and the use of the Unicode character encoding has resolved problems with non-Latin alphabets. Some limitations have only been changed recently, such as with domain names, which previously allowed only ASCII characters.\n\nThe computing terminology of many languages borrows from English. Some language communities resist actively to that trend, and in other cases English is used extensively and more directly. This section gives some examples for the use of English terminology in other languages, and also mentions any notable differences.\n\nBoth English and Russian have influence over Bulgarian computing vocabulary. However, in many cases the borrowed terminology is translated, and not transcribed phonetically. Combined with the use of Cyrillic this can make it difficult to recognize loanwords. For example, the Bulgarian term for motherboard is 'дънна платка' (IPA /danna platka/ or literally \"bottom board\").\n\n\nThe Faroese language has a sparse scientific vocabulary \"based on the language itself\". Many Faroese scientific words are borrowed and/or modified versions of especially Nordic and English equivalents. The vocabulary is constantly evolving and thus new words often die out, and only a few survive and become widely used. Examples of successful words include e.g. \"telda\" (computer), \"kurla\" (at sign) and \"ambætari\" (server).\n\nIn French, there are some generally accepted English loan-words, but there is also a distinct effort to avoid them. In France, the Académie française is responsible for the standardisation of the language and often coins new technological terms. Some of them are accepted in practice, in other cases the English loanwords remain predominant. In Quebec, the Office québécois de la langue française has a similar function.\n\n\nIn German, English words are very often used as well:\n\nThe Icelandic language has its own vocabulary of scientific terms, still English borrowings exist. English or Icelandicised words are mostly used in casual conversations, whereas the Icelandic words might be longer or not widespread.\n\nIt's quite common to use English words in regards to computing in all Scandinavian languages.\n\nnouns: keyboard, webside, mail, software, blogg, spam\n\nverbs: å boote, å spamme, å blogge\n\nPolish language words derived from English:\n\n\nThe English influence on the software industry and the internet in Latin America has borrowed significantly from the Castilian lexicon.\n\n\n\nMany computing terms in Spanish share a common root with their English counterpart. In these cases, both terms are understood, but the Spanish is preferred for formal use:\n\nThe early computer software and hardware had very little support for alphabets other than the Latin. As a result of this it was difficult or impossible to represent languages based on other scripts. The ASCII character encoding, created in the 1960s, only supported 128 different characters. With the use of additional software it was possible to provide support for some languages, for instance those based on the Cyrillic alphabet. However, complex-script languages like Chinese or Japanese need more characters than the 256 limit imposed by 8-bit character encodings. Some computers created in the former USSR had native support for the Cyrillic alphabet.\n\nThe wide adoption of Unicode, and UTF-8 on the web, resolved most of these historical limitations. ASCII remains the de facto standard for command interpreters, programming languages and text-based communication protocols.\n\n\nThe syntax of most programming languages uses English keywords, and therefore it could be argued some knowledge of English is required in order to use them. However, it is important to recognize all programming languages are in the class of formal languages. They are very different from any natural language, including English.\n\nSome examples of non-English programming languages:\n\n\nMany application protocols use text strings for requests and parameters, rather than the binary values commonly used in lower layer protocols. The request strings are generally based on English words, although in some cases the strings are contractions or acronyms of English expressions, which renders them somewhat cryptic to anyone not familiar with the protocol, whatever their proficiency in English. Nevertheless, the use of word-like strings is a convenient mnemonic device that allows a person skilled in the art (and with sufficient knowledge of English) to execute the protocol manually from a keyboard, usually for the purpose of finding a problem with the service.\n\nExamples:\n\nIt is notable that response codes, that is, the strings sent back by the recipient of a request, are typically numeric: for instance, in HTTP (and some borrowed by other protocols)\n\nThis is because response codes also need to convey unambiguous information, but can have various nuances that the requester may optionally use to vary its subsequent actions. To convey all such \"sub-codes\" with alphabetic words would be unwieldy, and negate the advantage of using pseudo-English words. Since responses are usually generated by software they do not need to be mnemonic. Numeric codes are also more easily analysed and categorised when they are processed by software, instead of a human testing the protocol by manual input.\n\nMany personal computers have a BIOS chip, displaying text in English during boot time.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts are usually defined in terms of English keywords such as CTRL+F for find.\n\nEnglish is the largest language on the World Wide Web, with 27% of internet users.\n\nWeb user percentages usually focus on raw comparisons of the first language of those who access the web. Just as important is a consideration of second- and foreign-language users; i.e., the first language of a user does not necessarily reflect which language he or she regularly employs when using the web.\n\nEnglish-language users appear to be a plurality of web users, consistently cited as around one-third of the overall (near one billion). This reflects the relative affluence of English-speaking countries and high Internet penetration rates in them. This lead may be eroding due mainly to a rapid increase of Chinese users.\n\nFirst-language users among other relatively affluent countries appear generally stable, the two largest being German and Japanese, which each have between 5% and 10% of the overall share.\n\nOne widely quoted figure for the amount of web content in English is 80%. Other sources show figures five to fifteen points lower, though still well over 50%. There are two notable facts about these percentages:\n\nThe English web content is greater than the number of first-language English users by as much as 2 to 1.\n\nGiven the enormous lead it already enjoys and its increasing use as a \"lingua franca\" in other spheres, English web content may continue to dominate even as English first-language Internet users decline. This is a classic positive feedback loop: new Internet users find it helpful to learn English and employ it online, thus reinforcing the language's prestige and forcing subsequent new users to learn English as well.\n\nCertain other factors (some predating the medium's appearance) have propelled English into a majority web-content position. Most notable in this regard is the tendency for researchers and professionals to publish in English to ensure maximum exposure.

{"id": "2784767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2784767", "title": "Fantastic art", "text": "Fantastic art\n\nFantastic art is a broad and loosely defined art genre. It is not restricted to a specific school of artists, geographical location or historical period. It can be characterised by subject matter – which portrays non-realistic, mystical, mythical or folkloric subjects or events – and style, which is representational and naturalistic, rather than abstract - or in the case of magazine illustrations and similar, in the style of graphic novel art such as manga.\n\nFantasy has been an integral part of art since its beginnings, but has been particularly important in mannerism, magic realist painting, romantic art, symbolism, surrealism and lowbrow. In French, the genre is called le fantastique, in English it is sometimes referred to as \"visionary art\", \"grotesque art\" or mannerist art. It has had a deep and circular interaction with fantasy literature.\n\nThe subject matter of Fantastic Art may resemble the product of hallucinations, and Fantastic artist Richard Dadd spent much of his life in mental institutions. Salvador Dalí famously said: \"the only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad\". Some recent Fantastic Art draws on the artist's experience, or purported experience, of hallucinogenic drugs.\n\nThe term Fantasy Art is closely related, and is applied primarily to recent art (typically 20th century onwards) inspired by, or illustrating, fantasy literature. The term has acquired some pejorative overtones.\n\nFantastic art has traditionally been largely confined to painting and illustration, but since the 1970s has increasingly been found also in photography. Fantastic art explores fantasy, imagination, the dream state, the grotesque, visions and the uncanny, as well as so-called \"Goth\" art.\n\nGenres which may also be considered as Fantastic Art include the Symbolism of the Victorian era, and Surrealism. Works based on classical mythology, which have been a staple of European art from the Renaissance period, also arguably meet the definition of Fantastic Art, as art based on modern mythology such as JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth mythos unquestionably does. Religious art also depicts supernatural or miraculous subjects in a naturalistic way, but is not generally regarded as Fantastic Art.\n\nMany artists have produced works which fit the definition of fantastic art. Some, such as Nicholas Roerich, worked almost exclusively in the genre, others such as Hieronymus Bosch, who has been described as the first \"fantastic\" artist in the Western tradition, produced works both with and without fantastic elements, and for artists such as Francisco de Goya, fantastic works were only a small part of their output. Others again such as René Magritte are usually classed as Surrealists but use fantastic elements in their work. It is therefore impossible to give an exhaustive list of fantastic artists, but a selection of major and influential figures is listed below.\n\n\nThe rise of fantasy and science fiction \"pulp\" magazines demanded artwork to illustrate stories and (via cover art) to promote sales. This led to a movement of science fiction and fantasy artists prior to and during the Great Depression, as anthologised by Vincent Di Fate, himself a prolific SF and space artist.\n\nIn the United States in the 1930s, a group of Wisconsin artists inspired by the Surrealist movement of Europe created their own brand of fantastic art. They included Madison, Wisconsin-based artists Marshall Glasier, Dudley Huppler and John Wilde; Karl Priebe of Milwaukee and Gertrude Abercrombie of Chicago. Their art combined macabre humor, mystery and irony which was in direct and pointed contradiction to the American Regionalism then in vogue.\n\nIn postwar Chicago, the art movement Chicago Imagism produced many fantastic and grotesque paintings, which were little noted because they did not conform to New York abstract art fashions of the time. Major imagists include Roger Brown, Gladys Nilsson, Jim Nutt, Ed Paschke, and Karl Wirsum.\n\nNon-European art may contain fantastic elements, although it is not necessarily easy to separate them from religious elements involving supernatural beings and miraculous events.\n\nSculptor Bunleua Sulilat is a notable contemporary Asian Fantastic artist.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1183090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1183090", "title": "Gord (archaeology)", "text": "Gord (archaeology)\n\nA gord is a medieval Slavic fortified wooden settlement, sometimes known as a burgwall after the German term for such sites. Gords were built during the late Bronze and early Iron Ages by the Lusatian culture (c. 1300–500 BCE), and later in the 8th–7th centuries BCE, in what is now Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, eastern Germany, Romania/Moldova, Belarus and western Ukraine. These settlements were usually founded on strategic sites such as hills, riverbanks, lake islands, or peninsulas.\n\nA typical gord was a group of wooden houses built either in rows or in circles, surrounded by one or more rings of walls made of earth and wood, a palisade, and/or moats. Some gords were ring-shaped, with a round, oval, or occasionally polygonal fence or wall surrounding a hollow. Others, built on a natural hill or a man-made mound, were cone-shaped. Those with a natural defense on one side, such as a river or lake, were usually horseshoe-shaped. Most gords were built in densely populated areas on sites that offered particular natural advantages.\n\nAs Slavic tribes united to form states, gords were also built for defensive purposes in less-populated border areas. Gords in which rulers resided or that lay on trade routes quickly expanded. Near the gord, or below it in elevation, there formed small communities of servants, merchants, artisans, and others who served the higher-ranked inhabitants of the gord. Each such community was known as a \"suburbium\" (). Its residents could shelter within the walls of the gord in the event of danger. Eventually the \"suburbium\" acquired its own fence or wall. In the High Middle Ages, the gord usually evolved into a castle or citadel (kremlin) and the \"suburbium\" into a town.\n\nSome gords did not stand the test of time and were abandoned or destroyed, gradually turning into more or less discernible mounds or rings of earth (Russian \"gorodische,\" Polish \"grodzisko,\" Ukrainian \"horodyshche,\" Slovak \"hradisko,\" Czech \"hradiště,\" and Serbian \"gradiška\"/\"градишка\"). Notable archeological sites include Biskupin, Poland; and Bilsk, Ukraine (see Gelonus).\n\nThe term ultimately descends from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root \"ǵʰortós\", enclosure. From this same root come the Germanic word elements *\"gard\" and *\"gart\" (as in Stuttgart), and likely also the names of Graz, Austria and Gartz, Germany. Cognate to these are English words such as \"yard\", \"garth\", \"girdle,\" and \"court.\" Also cognate but less closely related are Latin \"hortus,\" a garden, and its English descendants \"horticulture\" and \"orchard\".\n\nFurther afield, in ancient Iran, a fortified wooden settlement was called a \"gerd\", which became \"jerd\" under later Arab influence. Burugerd or Borujerd is a city in the West of Iran. The Indian suffix \"-garh,\" meaning a fort in Hindi, Sanskrit, and other Indo-Iranian languages, appears in many Indian place names. Given that both Slavic and Indo-Iranian are sub-branches of Indo-European and that there are numerous similarities in Russian vocabulary and Sanskrit vocabulary, it is plausible that \"garh\" and \"gorod\" are related, although this is strongly contradicted by the phoneme /g/ in Indo-Iranian, which cannot be a reflex of the Indo-European palatovelar /*ǵ/.\n\nThe Proto-Slavic word \"*gordъ\" later differentiated into grad (Cyrillic: град) and gorod (Cyrillic: город), etc. It is the root of various words in modern Slavic languages pertaining to fences and fenced areas (Ukrainian horodyty, Czech ohradit, Russian ogradit, Serbo-Croatian ograditi, and Polish ogradzać, grodzić, to fence off). It also has evolved into words for a garden:\n\nAdditionally, it has furnished numerous modern Slavic words for a city or town:\n\nThe names of many Central and Eastern European cities harken back to their pasts as gords. Some of them are in countries which once were but no longer are mainly inhabited by Slavic-speaking peoples. Examples include:\n\nThe Polish word for \"suburbium\", \"podgrodzie\", literally means a settlement beneath a town: the \"gród\" was frequently built at the top of a hill, and the \"podgrodzie\" at its foot. (The Slavic prefix \"pod-\", meaning \"under/below\" and descending from the Proto-Indo-European root \"pṓds,\" meaning foot, is equivalent to Latin \"sub-\".) The word survives in the names of several villages (Podgrodzie, Subcarpathian Voivodeship) and town districts (e.g., that of Olsztyn), as well as in the names of the German municipalities Puttgarden, Wagria and Putgarten, Rügen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26586160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26586160", "title": "History of glass", "text": "History of glass\n\nThe history of glass-making dates back to at least 3600 years ago in Mesopotamia. However, they may have been producing second-rate copies of glass objects from Egypt, where this complex craft originated. Other archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or Egypt. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid second millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as the accidental by-products of metal-working (slags) or during the production of faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing. Glass products remained a luxury until the disasters that overtook the late Bronze Age civilizations seemingly brought glass-making to a halt.\n\nDevelopment of glass technology in India may have begun in 1730 BC. In ancient China, though, glass-making seems to have had a late start compared to ceramics and metal work. From across the former Roman Empire archaeologists have recovered glass objects that were used in domestic, industrial and funerary contexts.\nAnglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the Anglo-Saxon period was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewelry.\n\nNaturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic glass obsidian, has been used by many Stone Age societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded. But in general, archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, Mesopotamia or ancient Egypt. Because of Egypt's favorable environment for preservation, the majority of well-studied early glass is found there, although some of this is likely to have been imported. The earliest known glass objects, of the mid-third millennium BC, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of metal-working (slags) or during the production of faience, a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing.\n\nDuring the Late Bronze Age in Egypt (e.g., the Ahhotep \"Treasure\") and Western Asia (e.g., Megiddo), there was a rapid growth in glassmaking technology. Archaeological finds from this period include colored glass ingots, vessels (often colored and shaped in imitation of highly prized hardstone carvings in semi-precious stones) and the ubiquitous beads. The alkali of Syrian and Egyptian glass was soda ash (sodium carbonate), which can be extracted from the ashes of many plants, notably halophile seashore plants like saltwort. The latest vessels were 'core-formed', produced by winding a ductile rope of glass around a shaped core of sand and clay over a metal rod, then fusing it with repeated reheatings.\n\nThreads of thin glass of different colors made with admixtures of oxides were subsequently wound around these to create patterns, which could be drawn into festoons by using metal raking tools. The vessel would then be rolled smooth (marvered) on a slab in order to press the decorative threads into its body. Handles and feet were applied separately. The rod was subsequently allowed to cool as the glass slowly annealed and was eventually removed from the center of the vessel, after which the core material was scraped out. Glass shapes for inlays were also often created in moulds. Much early glass production, however, relied on grinding techniques borrowed from stone working. This meant that the glass was ground and carved in a cold state.\n\nBy the 15th century BC, extensive glass production was occurring in Western Asia, Crete, and Egypt; and the Mycenaean Greek term , \"ku-wa-no-wo-ko-i\", meaning \"workers of lapis lazuli and glass\" (written in Linear b syllabic script) is attested. \nIt is thought that the techniques and recipes required for the initial fusing of glass from raw materials was a closely guarded technological secret reserved for the large palace industries of powerful states. Glass workers in other areas therefore relied on imports of preformed glass, often in the form of cast ingots such as those found on the Ulu Burun shipwreck off the coast of modern Turkey.\n\nGlass remained a luxury material, and the disasters that overtook Late Bronze Age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt. It picked up again in its former sites, Syria and Cyprus, in the 9th century BC, when the techniques for making colorless glass were discovered. The first glassmaking \"manual\" dates back to ca. 650 BC. Instructions on how to make glass are contained in cuneiform tablets discovered in the library of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal. In Egypt glass-making did not revive until it was reintroduced in Ptolemaic Alexandria. Core-formed vessels and beads were still widely produced, but other techniques came to the fore with experimentation and technological advancements. During the Hellenistic period many new techniques of glass production were introduced and glass began to be used to make larger pieces, notably table wares. Techniques developed during this period include 'slumping' viscous (but not fully molten) glass over a mould in order to form a dish and 'millefiori' (meaning 'thousand flowers') technique, where canes of multicolored glass were sliced and the slices arranged together and fused in a mould to create a mosaic-like effect. It was also during this period that colorless or decolored glass began to be prized and methods for achieving this effect were investigated more fully.\n\nAccording to Pliny the Elder, Phoenician traders were the first to stumble upon glass manufacturing techniques at the site of the Belus River. Georgius Agricola, in \"De re metallica\", reported a traditional serendipitous \"discovery\" tale of familiar type:\n\n\"The tradition is that a merchant ship laden with nitrum being moored at this place, the merchants were preparing their meal on the beach, and not having stones to prop up their pots, they used lumps of nitrum from the ship, which fused and mixed with the sands of the shore, and there flowed streams of a new translucent liquid, and thus was the origin of glass.\"\n\nThis account is more a reflection of Roman experience of glass production, however, as white silica sand from this area was used in the production of glass within the Roman Empire due to its high purity levels. During the 1st century BC glass blowing was discovered on the Syro-Judean coast, revolutionizing the industry. Glass vessels were now inexpensive compared to pottery vessels. A growth of the use of glass products occurred throughout the Roman world. Glass became the Roman plastic, and glass containers produced in Alexandria spread throughout the Roman Empire. With the discovery of clear glass (through the introduction of manganese dioxide), by glass blowers in Alexandria circa 100 AD, the Romans began to use glass for architectural purposes. Cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical qualities, began to appear in the most important buildings in Rome and the most luxurious villas of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Over the next 1,000 years, glass making and working continued and spread through southern Europe and beyond.\n\nThe first Persian glass was discovered in the explorations of Dinkhahtepe in Azarbaijan by Burny. It was glass bead from the late Bronze Age (1600 B.C.). Then in the middle Elam era of Chogha, Zanbil Temple existed. Many glass tubes were discovered by French teams. Today it is certain that the mosaic glass cups from the Iron Age of North Iran, such as Hassnlou Tepe, Marlik Tepe. It resembles a number of Mesopotamian examples, in Susa of late Elam, a few glass vessels were discovered, of core forming technique. Also in Azarbaijan and Kordestan, the Gilan provinces, a few kohl tubes were discovered from the late Iron Age that continued into the Achamenid period. In this time achamind bowls and colorless glass growing on empair but in selukid and parthian times helleni and roman techniques were Prevalented and Sassanian era seem local motives on glass vessels.\n\nIndian development of glass technology in South Asia may have begun in 1730 BC. Evidence of this culture includes a red-brown glass bead along with a hoard of beads dating to that period, making it the earliest attested glass from the Indus Valley locations. Glass discovered from later sites dating from 600–300 BC displays common colors.\n\nChalcolithic evidence of glass has been found in Hastinapur, India. \nSome of the texts which mention glass in India are the \"Shatapatha Brahmana\" and \"Vinaya Pitaka\". However, the first unmistakable evidence in large quantities, dating from the 3rd century BC, has been uncovered from the archaeological site in Takshashila, now in Pakistan, with bangles, beads, small vessels, and tiles discovered in quantity.\n\nBy the 1st century AD, glass was being used for ornaments and casing in South Asia. Contact with the Greco-Roman world added newer techniques, and Indians artisans mastered several techniques of glass molding, decorating and coloring by the succeeding centuries. The Satavahana period of India also produced short cylinders of composite glass, including those displaying a lemon yellow matrix covered with green glass.\n\nIn Chinese history, glass played a peripheral role in the arts and crafts, when compared to ceramics and metal work. The limited archaeological distribution and use of glass objects are evidence of the rarity of the material. Literary sources date the first manufacture of glass to the 5th century AD. However, the earliest archaeological evidence for glass manufacture in China comes from the Warring States period (475 BC to 221 BC).\n\nChinese learned to manufacture glass comparably later than the Mesopotamians, Egyptians and Indians. Imported glass objects first reached China during the late Spring and Autumn period – early Warring States period (early 5th century BC), in the form of polychrome ‘eye beads’. These imports created the impetus for the production of indigenous glass beads.\n\nDuring the Han period (206 BC to 220 AD) the use of glass diversified. The introduction of glass casting in this period encouraged the production of moulded objects, such as bi disks and other ritual objects. The Chinese glass objects from the Warring States period and Han Dynasty vary greatly in chemical composition from the imported glass objects. The glasses from this period contain high levels of barium oxide (BaO) and lead, distinguishing them from the soda-lime-silica glasses of Western Asia and Mesopotamia. At the end of the Han Dynasty (AD 220), the lead-barium glass tradition declined, with glass production only resuming during the 4th and 5th centuries AD.\n\nRoman glass production developed from Hellenistic technical traditions, initially concentrating on the production of intensely colored cast glass vessels. Glass objects have been recovered across the Roman Empire in domestic, funerary and industrial contexts. Glass was used primarily for the production of vessels, although mosaic tiles and window glass were also produced.\n\nHowever, during the 1st century AD, the industry underwent rapid technical growth that saw the introduction of glass blowing and the dominance of colorless or ‘aqua’ glasses. Production of raw glass was undertaken in geographically separate locations to the working of glass into finished vessels, and by the end of the 1st century AD large scale manufacturing, primarily in Alexandria, resulted in the establishment of glass as a commonly available material in the Roman world.\n\nIslamic glass continued the achievements of pre-Islamic cultures, especially the Sasanian glass of Persia. The Arab poet al-Buhturi (820–897) described the clarity of such glass: \"Its color hides the glass as if it is standing in it without a container.\" In the 8th century, the Persian-Arab chemist Jābir ibn Hayyān (Geber) described 46 recipes for producing colored glass in \"Kitab al-Durra al-Maknuna\" (\"The Book of the Hidden Pearl\"), in addition to 12 recipes inserted by al-Marrakishi in a later edition of the book. By the 11th century, clear glass mirrors were being produced in Arab Islamic Spain.\n\nThe Roman tradition of very fine glassmaking did not continue in the Middle Ages, and Anglo-Saxon glass and other regional traditions were mainly functional pieces, mostly somewhat crude forest glass. The claw beaker was popular as a relatively easy to make but impressive vessel that exploited the unique potential of glass. Only at the end of the period did European glass vessels once again become very fine in quality, imitating those imported from the Islamic world..\n\nGlass objects from the 7th and 8th centuries have been found on the island of Torcello near Venice. These form an important link between Roman times and the later importance of that city in the production of the material. Around 1000 AD, an important technical breakthrough was made in Northern Europe when soda glass, produced from white pebbles and burnt vegetation was replaced by glass made from a much more readily available material: potash obtained from wood ashes. From this point on, northern glass differed significantly from that made in the Mediterranean area, where soda remained in common use.\n\nUntil the 12th century, stained glass – glass to which metallic or other impurities had been added for coloring – was not widely used, but it rapidly became an important medium for Romanesque art and especially Gothic art. Almost all survivals are in church buildings, but it was also used in grand secular buildings. The 11th century saw the emergence in Germany of new ways of making sheet glass by blowing spheres. The spheres were swung out to form cylinders and then cut while still hot, after which the sheets were flattened. This technique was perfected in 13th century Venice. The Crown glass process was used up to the mid-19th century. In this process, the glassblower would spin approximately 9 pounds (4 kg) of molten glass at the end of a rod until it flattened into a disk approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) in diameter. The disk would then be cut into panes. Domestic glass vessels in late medieval Northern Europe are known as forest glass.\n\nAnglo-Saxon glass has been found across England during archaeological excavations of both settlement and cemetery sites. Glass in the Anglo-Saxon period was used in the manufacture of a range of objects including vessels, beads, windows and was even used in jewelry. In the 5th century AD with the Roman departure from Britain, there were also considerable changes in the usage of glass. Excavation of Romano-British sites have revealed plentiful amounts of glass but, in contrast, the amount recovered from 5th century and later Anglo-Saxon sites is minuscule.\n\nThe majority of complete vessels and assemblages of beads come from the excavations of early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, but a change in burial rites in the late 7th century affected the recovery of glass, as Christian Anglo-Saxons were buried with fewer grave goods, and glass is rarely found. From the late 7th century onwards, window glass is found more frequently. This is directly related to the introduction of Christianity and the construction of churches and monasteries. There are a few Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical literary sources that mention the production and use of glass, although these relate to window glass used in ecclesiastical buildings. Glass was also used by the Anglo-Saxons in their jewelry, both as enamel or as cut glass insets.\n\nThe center for luxury Italian glassmaking from the 14th century was the island of Murano, which developed many new techniques and became the center of a lucrative export trade in dinnerware, mirrors, and other items. What made Venetian Murano glass significantly different was that the local quartz pebbles were almost pure silica, and were ground into a fine clear sand that was combined with soda ash obtained from the Levant, for which the Venetians held the sole monopoly. The clearest and finest glass is tinted in two ways: firstly, a natural coloring agent is ground and melted with the glass. Many of these coloring agents still exist today; for a list of coloring agents, see below. Black glass was called \"obsidianus\" after obsidian stone. A second method is apparently to produce a black glass which, when held to the light, will show the true color that this glass will give to another glass when used as a dye.\n\nThe Venetian ability to produce this superior form of glass resulted in a trade advantage over other glass producing lands. Murano’s reputation as a center for glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire might burn down the city’s mostly wood buildings, ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to Murano in 1291. Murano's glassmakers were soon the island’s most prominent citizens. Glassmakers were not allowed to leave the Republic. Many took a risk and set up glass furnaces in surrounding cities and as far afield as England and the Netherlands.\n\nBohemian glass, or Bohemia crystal, is a decorative glass produced in regions of Bohemia and Silesia, now in the current state of the Czech Republic, since the 13th century. Oldest archaeology excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the Lusatian Mountains of Northern Bohemia. Most notable sites of glass-making throughout the ages are Skalice (), Kamenický Šenov () and Nový Bor (). Both Nový Bor and Kamenický Šenov have their own Glass Museums with many items dating since around 1600. It was especially outstanding in its manufacture of glass in high Baroque style from 1685 to 1750. In the 17th century, Caspar Lehmann, gem cutter to Emperor Rudolf II in Prague, adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with copper and bronze wheels.\n\nA very important advance in glass manufacture was the technique of adding lead oxide to the molten glass; this improved the appearance of the glass and made it easier to melt using sea-coal as a furnace fuel. This technique also increased the \"working period\" of the glass, making it easier to manipulate. The process was first discovered by George Ravenscroft in 1674, who was the first to produce clear lead crystal glassware on an industrial scale. Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, allowing England to overtake Venice as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Seeking to find an alternative to Venetian \"cristallo\", he used flint as a silica source, but his glasses tended to crizzle, developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency. This was eventually overcome by replacing some of the potash flux with lead oxide to the melt.\n\nHe was granted a protective patent in 1673, where production and refinement moved from his glasshouse on the Savoy to the seclusion of Henley-on-Thames.\n\nBy 1696, after the patent expired, twenty-seven glasshouses in England were producing flint glass and were exporting all over Europe with such success that, in 1746, the British Government imposed a lucrative tax on it. Rather than drastically reduce the lead content of their glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as \"Excise glasses\". The British glass making industry was able to take off with the repeal of the tax in 1845.\n\nEvidence of the use of the blown plate glass method dates back to 1620 in London and was used for mirrors and coach plates. Louis Lucas de Nehou and A. Thevart perfected the process of casting Polished plate glass in 1688 in France. Prior to this invention, mirror plates, made from blown \"sheet\" glass, had been limited in size. De Nehou's process of rolling molten glass poured on an iron table rendered the manufacture of very large plates possible. This method of production was adopted by the English in 1773 at Ravenhead. The polishing process was industrialized around 1800 with the adoption of a steam engine to carry out the grinding and polishing of the cast glass.\n\nThe use of glass as a building material was heralded by The Crystal Palace of 1851, built by Joseph Paxton to house the Great Exhibition. Paxton's revolutionary new building inspired the public use of glass as a material for domestic and horticultural architecture. In 1832, the British Crown Glass Company (later Chance Brothers) became the first company to adopt the cylinder method to produce sheet glass with the expertise of Georges Bontemps, a famous French glassmaker. This glass was produced by blowing long cylinders of glass, which were then cut along the length and then flattened onto a cast-iron table, before being annealed. Plate glass involves the glass being ladled onto a cast-iron bed, where it is rolled into a sheet with an iron roller. The sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an annealing tunnel or temperature-controlled oven called a lehr, down which it was carried by a system of rollers. James Hartley introduced the Rolled Plate method in 1847. This allowed a ribbed finish and was often used for extensive glass roofs such as within railway stations.\n\nAn early advance in automating glass manufacturing was patented in 1848 by the engineer Henry Bessemer. His system produced a continuous ribbon of flat glass by forming the ribbon between rollers. This was an expensive process, as the surfaces of the glass needed polishing and was later abandoned by its sponsor, Robert Lucas Chance of Chance Brothers, as unviable. Bessemer also introduced an early form of \"Float Glass\" in 1843, which involved pouring glass onto liquid tin.\n\nIn 1887, the mass production of glass was developed by the firm Ashley in Castleford, Yorkshire. This semi-automatic process used machines that were capable of producing 200 standardized bottles per hour, many times quicker than the traditional methods of manufacture. Chance Brothers also introduced the machine rolled patterned glass method in 1888.\nIn 1898, Pilkington invented Wired Cast glass, where the glass incorporates a strong steel-wire mesh for safety and security. This was commonly given the misnomer \"Georgian Wired Glass\" but it greatly post-dates the Georgian era. The Machine Drawn Cylinder technique was invented in the US and was the first mechanical method for the drawing of window glass. It was manufactured under licence in the UK by Pilkington from 1910 onwards.\n\nIn 1938, the polished plate process was improved by Pilkington which incorporated a double grinding process to give an improved quality to the finish. Between 1953 and 1957, Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the revolutionary float glass process, the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity. This method gave the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. Modern windows are made from float glass. Most float glass is soda-lime glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate and flat panel display glass are also produced using the float glass process. The success of this process lay in the careful balance of the volume of glass fed onto the bath, where it was flattened by its own weight. Full scale profitable sales of float glass were first achieved in 1960.\n\n"}

{"id": "25912911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25912911", "title": "Liberal corporatism", "text": "Liberal corporatism\n\nLiberal corporatism is the application of economic corporatism by liberal political parties and organizations, that recognizes the bargaining interests of multiple groups within society, such as in the business, labour, and agricultural sectors and licenses them to engage in bargaining over economic policy with the state. Liberal corporatism is often in conflict from proponents of liberal pluralism that opposes the granting of power to organized interest groups. English liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill supported corporatist-like economic associations as needing to predominate in society to create equality for labourers and give them a voice in management through democratic economic rights. Unlike a number of other forms of corporatism, liberal corporatism does not reject capitalism or individualism, but believes that the capitalist firm is a social institution that requires its managers to go beyond achieving the bottom line, by recognizing the needs of their members. This liberal corporatist ethic was similar to Taylorism but called for democratization of the capitalism firm. Liberal corporatists believed that inclusion of all members in the election of management would bring them into the process of management and in effect \"reconcile ethics and efficiency, freedom and order, liberty and rationality\".\n\nLiberal corporatism was an influential component of the progressivism in the United States that has been referred to as \"interest group liberalism\". The support by labour leaders' advocacy of liberal corporatism of the U.S. progressives is believed to have been influenced by an attraction to the syndicalism and particularly the anarcho-syndicalism at the time in Europe. In the United States, economic corporatism involving capital-labour cooperation was influential in the New Deal economic program of the United States in the 1930s as well as in Fordism and Keynesianism. Liberal corporatism is commonly supported by proponents in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.\n"}
{"id": "377779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=377779", "title": "Mani pulite", "text": "Mani pulite\n\nMani pulite (, Italian for \"clean hands\") was a nationwide judicial investigation into political corruption in Italy held in the 1990s. \"Mani pulite\" led to the demise of the so-called \"First Republic\", resulting in the disappearance of many political parties. Some politicians and industry leaders committed suicide after their crimes were exposed. Antonio Di Pietro was the main judicial figure in charge of the operation.\n\nIn some accounts, as many as 5,000 public figures fell under suspicion. At one point, more than half of the members of the Italian Parliament were under indictment. More than 400 city and town councils were dissolved because of corruption charges. The estimated value of bribes paid annually in the 1980s by Italian and foreign companies bidding for large government contracts reached US$4 billion dollars (6.5 trillion lire).\n\nThe corrupt system uncovered by the investigation was referred to as Tangentopoli (). The term derives from \"tangente\", which means \"kickback\" and in this context refers to kickbacks given for public works contracts, and \"poli\" meaning city; it is thus sometimes translated as \"Bribesville\" or \"Kickback City\".\n\n\"Tangentopoli\" began on 17 February 1992 when Judge Antonio Di Pietro had Mario Chiesa, a member of the centre-left Italian Socialist Party (PSI), arrested for accepting a bribe from a Milan cleaning firm. The PSI distanced themselves from Chiesa, with PSI leader Bettino Craxi calling him \"mariuolo\", or \"villain\", a \"wild splinter\" of the otherwise clean party. Upset over this treatment by his former colleagues, Chiesa began to give information about corruption implicating them. This marked the beginning of the \"mani pulite\" investigation; news of political corruption began spreading in the Italian press.\n\nIn the 1992 elections, the centre-right Christian Democracy (DC) held on to power when its coalition government kept a small majority, while leftist opposition parties gained support. However, the Italian Communist Party split after the fall of the Soviet Union, depriving the opposition of leadership. Many votes went to the far-right Lega Nord, which was not inclined to form alliances with other parties at the time. The resulting parliament was therefore weak and difficult to bring to an agreement.\n\nDuring April 1992, many industrial figures and politicians from both the government and the opposition were arrested on charges of corruption. While the investigations started in Milan, they quickly spread to other towns as more politicians confessed. One grotesque situation occurred when a Socialist politician immediately confessed to all of his crimes to two Carabinieri who had come to his house, only to later discover that they had come to deliver a mere fine for a traffic violation. \n\nFundamental to this increased exposure was the general attitude of the main politicians to drop support for subordinates who got caught; this made many of them feel betrayed, and they often implicated many other figures, who in turn would implicate even more. On 2 September 1992, the Socialist politician Sergio Moroni, charged with corruption, committed suicide. He left a letter pleading guilty, declaring that crimes were not for his personal gain but for the party's benefit, and accused the financing system of all the political parties.\n\nIn the local December elections, DC lost half of their votes. The day after that, Craxi was officially accused of corruption. After many other politicians were accused and jailed, Craxi eventually resigned from the PSI.\n\nOn 5 March 1993, the Italian government of Giuliano Amato and his justice minister Giovanni Conso tried to find a solution with a decree, which allowed criminal charges for several bribery-related crimes to be replaced by administrative charges instead; according to Italian popular opinion at the time, that would have resulted in a \"de facto\" amnesty for most corruption charges. Amid public outrage and nationwide rallies, the Italian president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro refused to sign the decree, deeming it unconstitutional. The following week, a US$250 million affair involving Eni, the government-controlled national energy company, was revealed. The stream of accusations, confessions and jailing continued.\n\nOn 25 March, the Italian parliament changed the municipal electoral law in favor of a majoritarian system. Later, on 18 April, the public overwhelmingly backed the abrogation of the existing proportional representation parliamentary electoral law in a referendum (a mixed system was introduced that August), causing Amato to resign three days later. Still shocked by the recent events, the parliament was unable to produce a new government. Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, former governor of the Bank of Italy, was appointed head of the government; he appointed a technical government without political influences. In the meantime, the investigation of Craxi was blocked by the parliament. Several members of the government, having been in office just three days, resigned in protest; among them were Minister of the Environment Francesco Rutelli and Minister of Finance Vincenzo Visco. In new local elections on 6 June 1993, DC lost half of its votes once again; the PSI virtually disappeared. Instead Lega Nord, a far-right protest movement, became the strongest political force in Northern Italy. The left-wing opposition was approaching majority, but still lacked unity and leadership.\n\nEventually, all four parties in the 1992 government disappeared, at different times in different ways: DC, the PSI, the Italian Socialist Democratic Party, and the Italian Liberal Party. The Democratic Party of the Left, the Italian Republican Party and the Movimento Sociale Italiano were the only surviving national parties; the Republican Party is the only one that has maintained its name since.\n\nOn 20 July 1993, the former Eni president, Gabriele Cagliari, committed suicide in jail. His wife later gave back US$3 million of illegal funds. Meanwhile, Cusani faced trial and was accused of crimes connected to Enimont, a joint venture between Eni and another energy company, Montedison. The trial was broadcast on national television, and was a sort of showcase of the old politics being brought to their responsibilities. While Cusani himself was not a major figure, the connection of his crimes to the Enimont affair called in all the nation's major politicians as witnesses.\n\nA high note was reached in the Cusani trial when former head of government Arnaldo Forlani, answering a question, simply said, \"I don't remember\"; he happened to be very nervous and did not notice that sweat was accumulating on his lips, and that image was by many considered symbolic of the people's disgust for the corrupt system. Craxi, instead, admitted that his party received $93 million of illegal funds, defending his actions by saying that \"everyone was doing this.\" Even the Lega Nord was implicated in the trial; secretary Umberto Bossi and former treasurer Alessandro Patelli were convicted for receiving 200 million lire of illegal funding (approx. $100,000 at the time).\n\nA bribe to the Italian Communist Party was alleged, but it was not established who had committed the offence. A number of Milanese members of the Democratic Party of the Left were charged with corruption during their time as members of the PCI, but they were acquitted. As prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro stated, \"Penal responsibility is personal. I cannot bring here a person with the first name Communist and last name Party\". (\"La responsabilità penale è personale, non posso portare in giudizio una persona che si chiami Partito di nome e Comunista di cognome.\")\n\nThe Enimont trial itself was carried out after the Cusani trial, with much less public interest.\n\nIn the meantime, the investigation expanded outside the political range: on 2 September 1993, the Milan judge Diego Curtò was arrested. On 21 April 1994, 80 financial regulators and 300 industry personalities were charged with corruption. A few days later, the secretary of Fiat admitted corruption with a letter to a newspaper. Media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi entered politics later that year and won the 1994 general election, in what many thought was a move to shield his many business concerns from possible scrutiny. This suspicion was reinforced on 11 February, when Berlusconi's brother, Paolo, admitted to corruption crimes. \n\nOn 13 July 1994, the Berlusconi government made a new law to avoid jail time for most corruption crimes, the passage of which was timed to coincide with Italy's defeat of Bulgaria in the 1994 Football World Cup's semifinals in the hopes that the public would be distracted. However, as Roberto Baggio shot high the last penalty against Brazil, and newscasts showed images of corrupt politicians leaving jail, public opinion became enraged; the images of Francesco De Lorenzo, former Minister of Health, were especially striking, since the general public perceived stealing money from hospitals an especially heinous act.\n\nJust a few days before, the arrested regulators had been talking about corruption in Fininvest, the holding company controlled by the Berlusconi family. Most of the judge pool declared that they would respect the state's laws, but they could not work in a situation where duty and conscience were to conflict: they requested therefore to be reassigned to other duties. Since the government could not afford to be seen as an adversary of the popular judge pool, the decree was hastily revoked and marked a \"misunderstanding\"; Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, of Lega Nord, claimed that he had not even had the chance to read it. While the Minister of Justice was Alfredo Biondi, allegations that the decree was written by Cesare Previti, a lawyer from Fininvest, are at least credible.\n\nOn 29 July Berlusconi's brother was again arrested and immediately released.\n\nAt this point a public conflict erupted between Berlusconi and Di Pietro. While Berlusconi's companies were being investigated, \"inspectors\" were sent from the government to the Milanese judges' office to look for formal irregularities. None were ever found, but this tactic, coupled with Berlusconi's firm grip on the media, helped spread what is described in other environments as fear, uncertainty and doubt. The battle ended without winners: Di Pietro resigned on 6 December, two weeks before the Berlusconi government resigned ahead a critical confidence vote in parliament that was expected to go against them.\n\nDuring 1995, many investigations were started against Di Pietro, who would years later be cleared of all charges. Meanwhile, Berlusconi incurred other charges of corruption. It was later found that the man prosecuting Di Pietro, Fabio Salamone from Brescia, was the brother of a man that Di Pietro himself had prosecuted and sent to jail for various corruption charges. However, it wasn't until later that authorities realized the conflict of interest and reassigned Salamone, even though his investigations had taken a completely different direction: Paolo Berlusconi and Previti were accused of a conspiracy against Di Pietro, but the prosecutor who later replaced Salamone asked for their acquittal and so did the court.\n\nAfter being cleared, Di Pietro went into politics, despite previously not wishing to exploit the popularity gained doing what he perceived to be just his duty. His movement is named Italia dei Valori (\"Italy of values\"). In 1998, Cesare Previti, then sitting in parliament after the Berlusconi government, avoided jail thanks to parliamentary intervention, even though Berlusconi and his allies were in opposition. Craxi was sentenced to several years cumulative jail time in definitive convictions and fled to Tunisia, where he remained until his death on 19 January 2000.\n\nAfter 1994, trials became likely to be cancelled due to the expiration of statutory terms. The government ignored the pleas of the judiciary system for more funding to buy equipment, and passed laws that made Italy's notoriously slow legal system even slower and subject to earlier prescription. The intricate nature of these laws allowed lawyers to use many delaying tactics: an instructive example was a prosecution of Berlusconi, where he was accused of misappropriation of Fininvest's funds in order to prepare black funds that could have been used for bribes or other illegitimate purposes; on the last possible day, a lawyer from Fininvest appeared in court and complained that his company had not been formally notified of the trial. While this trial was well publicized in the media, the formality forced the trial to be restarted from scratch, and Berlusconi was finally acquitted by expiration of statutory terms. Being acquitted in this first trial, he could later benefit from a general reduction of terms for other trials, which in turn expired earlier with a domino effect.\n\nAfter Berlusconi's victory in the 2001 election, public opinion had turned so far against judges, where it is not only openly acceptable to criticize them for having carried out \"Mani pulite\", but also increasingly difficult to broadcast opinions favorable to Milan's pool. Some blame Berlusconi's media influence as having played a role in this change, or the inability of the opposition to gain the consent of conservative electors. Even Umberto Bossi, whose Lega Nord has been an opposition party, became highly critical of judges.\n\nThe term \"lottizzazione\", meaning the way a terrain is divided up in minor parts or \"lotti\", came to indicate the procedure of awarding top positions in important state conglomerates such as IRI, ENEL or ENI to political figures, or at least managers with a clear political orientation. This usually trickled down to lower levels, creating power centres depending on political parties that controlled a significant part of the production system. The available seats were usually awarded so that government parties (and opposition parties like the Italian Communist Party) would get a share of power corresponding to their perceived influence in the government.\n\nIn 2005, artist Gianni Motti created a piece of soap, named \"Mani Pulite\", based on the scandal. This piece was claimed to have been created out of the fat from a liposuction of Silvio Berlusconi. It was sold at the 36th edition of Art Basel for 15,000 euros.\n\nA 2015 television series titled \"1992\" is based on the events of \"mani pulite\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "65405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65405", "title": "Mauricio Kagel", "text": "Mauricio Kagel\n\nMauricio Raúl Kagel (; December 24, 1931 – September 18, 2008) was a German-Argentine composer notable for developing the theatrical side of musical performance . He spent his last fifty years in Germany, dying after a long illness at the age of 76 .\n\nKagel was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, into an Ashkenazi Jewish family that had fled from Russia in the 1920s . He studied music, history of literature, and philosophy in Buenos Aires . In 1957 he moved as a scholar to Cologne, Germany, where he lived until his death.\n\nFrom 1960–66 and 1972–76 he taught at the International Summer School at Darmstadt . He also taught from 1964–65 at the State University of New York at Buffalo as Slee Professor of music theory. At the Berlin Film and Television Academy he was a visiting lecturer. He served as director of courses for new music in Gothenburg and Cologne . He was professor for new music theatre at the Cologne Conservatory from 1974–97. Among his students were Maria de Alvear, Carola Bauckholt, Branimir Krstić, David Sawer, , Juan Maria Solare, Gerald Barry, and Chao-Ming Tung. \n\nSome of his pieces give specific theatrical instructions to the performers , such as to adopt certain facial expressions while playing, to make their stage entrances in a particular way, to physically interact with other performers, and so on. For this reason commentators at times related his work to the Theatre of the Absurd. He has been regarded by music historians as deploying a critical intelligence interrogating the position of music in society . He was also active in the fields of film and photography, proving that the possibilities of music are inexhaustible. In 1991 Kagel was invited by Walter Fink as the second composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival. In 2000 he received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize.\n\n\"Staatstheater\" (1970) remains, probably, Kagel’s best-known work. It is the piece that most clearly shows his absurdist tendency. He described it as a “ballet for non-dancers,” although it is in many ways more like an opera; the devices it uses as musical instruments include chamber pots and enema equipment. As the work progresses, the piece itself, and opera and ballet in general, becomes its own subject matter.\n\nSimilar is the radio play \"Ein Aufnahmezustand\" (1969) which is about the incidents surrounding the recording of a radio play. In \"Con voce\" (With Voice), a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. \"Match\" (1964), is a “tennis game” for cellists with a percussionist as umpire (for Siegfried Palm), also the subject of one of Kagel's films and perhaps the best-known of his works of instrumental theatre .\n\nBut Kagel wrote a large number of more conventional “pure” pieces too, including orchestral music, chamber music. Many of these make references to music of the past by, among others, Beethoven, Brahms, Bach and Liszt (; ).\n\nKagel also made films, with one of the best known being \"Ludwig van\" (1970), a critical interrogation of the uses of Beethoven's music made during the bicentenary of that composer's birth . In it, a reproduction of Beethoven's studio is seen, as part of a fictive visit of the Beethoven House in Bonn. Everything in it is papered with sheet music of Beethoven's pieces. The soundtrack of the film is a piano playing the music as it appears in each shot. Because the music has been wrapped around curves and edges, it is somewhat distorted, but Beethovenian motifs can still be heard.

Kagel later turned the film into a piece of sheet music itself which could be performed in a concert without the film—the score consists of close-ups of various areas of the studio, which are to be interpreted by the performing pianist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "625015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=625015", "title": "Mobile home", "text": "Mobile home\n\nA mobile home (also trailer, trailer home, house trailer, static caravan, residential caravan) is a prefabricated structure, built in a factory on a permanently attached chassis before being transported to site (either by being towed or on a trailer). Used as permanent homes, or for holiday or temporary accommodation, they are left often permanently or semi-permanently in one place, but can be moved, and may be required to move from time to time for legal reasons.\n\nMobile homes share the same historic origins as travel trailers, but today the two are very different in size and furnishings, with travel trailers being used primarily as temporary or vacation homes. Behind the cosmetic work fitted at installation to hide the base, there are strong trailer frames, axles, wheels, and tow-hitches.\n\nIn the United States, this form of housing goes back to the early years of cars and motorized highway travel. It was derived from the travel trailer (often referred to during the early years as \"house trailers\" or \"trailer coaches\"), a small unit with wheels attached permanently, often used for camping or extended travel. \nThe original rationale for this type of housing was its mobility. Units were initially marketed primarily to people whose lifestyle required mobility. However, beginning in the 1950s, the homes began to be marketed primarily as an inexpensive form of housing designed to be set up and left in a location for long periods of time, or even permanently installed with a masonry foundation. Previously, units had been eight feet or less in width, but in 1956, the 10-foot (3 m) wide home (\"ten-wide\") was introduced, along with the new term \"mobile home\".\n\nThe homes were given a rectangular shape, made from pre-painted aluminum panels, rather than the streamlined shape of travel trailers, which were usually painted after assembly. All of this helped increase the difference between these homes and home/travel trailers. The smaller, \"eight-wide\" units could be moved simply with a car, but the larger, wider units (\"ten-wide\", and, later, \"twelve-wide\") usually required the services of a professional trucking company, and, often, a special moving permit from a state highway department. During the late 1960s and early 70s, the homes were made even longer and wider, making the mobility of the units more difficult. Nowadays, when a factory-built home is moved to a location, it is usually kept there permanently and the mobility of the units has considerably decreased. In some states, mobile homes have been taxed as personal property if the wheels remain attached, but as real estate, if the wheels are removed. Removal of the tongue and axles may also be a requirement for real estate classification.\n\nMobile homes built in the United States since June 1976, legally referred to as manufactured homes, are required to meet FHA certification requirements, and come with attached metal certification tags. Mobile homes permanently installed on owned land are rarely mortgageable, whereas FHA code manufactured homes are mortgageable through VA, FHA, and Fannie Mae.\n\nMany people who could not afford a traditional site-built home, or did not desire to commit to spending a large sum of money on housing, began to see factory-built homes as a viable alternative for long-term housing needs. The units were often marketed as an alternative to apartment rental. However, the tendency of the units of this era to depreciate rapidly in resale value made using them as collateral for loans much riskier than traditional home loans. Terms were usually limited to less than the thirty-year term typical of the general home-loan market, and interest rates were considerably higher. In this way, mobile home loans resembled motor vehicle loans more than traditional home mortgage loans.\n\nMobile homes come in two major sizes, \"single-wides\" and \"double-wides\". Single-wides are or less in width and or less in length and can be towed to their site as a single unit. Double-wides are or more wide and are in length or less and are towed to their site in two separate units, which are then joined together. \"Triple-wides\" and even homes with four, five, or more units are also built, although not as commonly.\n\nWhile site-built homes are rarely moved, single-wide owners often \"trade\" or sell their home to a dealer in the form of the reduction of the purchase of a new home. These \"used\" homes are either re-sold to new owners or to park owners who use them as inexpensive rental units. Single-wides are more likely to be traded than double-wides because removing them from the site is easier. In fact, only about 5% of all double-wides will ever be moved.\n\nWhile an EF1 tornado might cause minor damage to a site-built home, it could do significant damage to a factory-built home, especially an older model or one that is not properly secured. Also, structural components (such as windows) are typically weaker than those in site-built homes. 70 miles per hour (113 kilometers per hour) winds can destroy a mobile home in a matter of minutes. Many brands offer optional hurricane straps, which can be used to tie the home to anchors embedded in the ground.\n\nIn the United States, these homes are regulated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), via the Federal National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. This national regulation has allowed many manufacturers to distribute nationwide because they are immune to the jurisdiction of local building authorities. By contrast, producers of modular homes must abide by state and local building codes. There are, however, wind zones adopted by HUD that home builders must follow. For example, statewide, Florida is at least windzone 2. South Florida is windzone 3, the strongest wind zone. After Hurricane Andrew in 1992, new standards were adopted for home construction. The codes for building within these wind zones were significantly amended, which has greatly increased their durability. During the 2004 hurricanes in Florida, these standards were put to the test, with great success. Yet, older models continue to face the exposed risk to high winds because of the attachments applied such as carports, porch and screen room additions. These areas are exposed to \"wind capture\" which apply extreme force to the underside of the integrated roof panel systems, ripping the fasteners through the roof pan causing a series of events which destroys the main roof system and the home.\n\nThe popularity of the factory-built homes caused complications the legal system was not prepared to handle. Originally, factory-built homes tended to be taxed as vehicles rather than real estate, which resulted in very low property tax rates for their inhabitants. This caused local governments to reclassify them for taxation purposes.\n\nHowever, even with this change, rapid depreciation often resulted in the home occupants paying far less in property taxes than had been anticipated and budgeted. The ability to move many factory-built homes rapidly into a relatively small area resulted in strains to the infrastructure and governmental services of the affected areas, such as inadequate water pressure and sewage disposal, and highway congestion. This led jurisdictions to begin placing limitations on the size and density of developments.\n\nEarly homes, even those that were well-maintained, tended to depreciate in value over time, much like motor vehicles. This is in contrast to site-built homes which include the land they are built on and tend to appreciate in value. The arrival of these homes in an area tended to be regarded with alarm, in part because of the devaluation of the housing potentially spreading to preexisting structures.\n\nThis combination of factors has caused most jurisdictions to place zoning regulations on the areas in which factory-built homes are placed, and limitations on the number and density of homes permitted on any given site. Other restrictions, such as minimum size requirements, limitations on exterior colors and finishes, and foundation mandates have also been enacted. There are many jurisdictions that will not allow the placement of any additional factory-built homes. Others have strongly limited or forbidden all single-wide models, which tend to depreciate in value more rapidly than modern double-wide models.\n\nApart from all the practical issues described above, there is also the constant discussion about legal fixture and chattels – meaning that the legal status of a trailer is, or could be, affected by its incorporation to the land or not. This sometimes involves such factors as whether or not the wheels have been removed.\n\nThe city of Cleveland in the state of Mississippi—the poorest in the United States—has made efforts to eliminate its \"run-down mobile homes\", which the city describes as \"unsightly\".\n\nThe North Carolina Board of Transportation allowed 14-foot-wide homes on the state's roads, but until January 1997, 16-foot-wide homes were not allowed. 41 states allowed 16-foot-side homes, but these were not sold in North Carolina. Under a trial program approved January 10, 1997, the wider homes could be delivered on specific roads, at certain times of day, traveling 10 MPH below the speed limit, with escort vehicles in front and behind. Eventually, all homes had to leave the state on interstate highways. In December 1997, a study showed the wider homes could be delivered safely, but some opponents still wanted the program to end. On December 2, 1999, the N.C. Manufactured Housing Institute asked the state Board of Transportation asked to expand the program to allow deliveries of 16-foot-wide homes within North Carolina. A month later, the board extended the pilot program by three months but did not vote to allow shipments within the state. In June 2000, the board voted to allow 16-foot-side homes to be shipped to other states on more two-lane roads, and to allow shipments in the state east of US 220. A third escort was required, including a law enforcement officer on two-lane roads.\n\nMobile homes are often sited in land lease communities known as trailer parks (also 'trailer courts', 'mobile home parks', 'mobile home communities', 'manufactured home communities', 'factory-built home communities' etc.), these communities allow homeowners to rent space on which to place a home. In addition to providing space, the site often provides basic utilities such as water, sewer, electricity, or natural gas and other amenities such as mowing, garbage removal, community rooms, pools, and playgrounds.\n\nThere are over 38,000 trailer parks in the United States ranging in size from 5 to over 1,000 home sites. Although most parks appeal to meeting basic housing needs, some communities specialize towards certain segments of the market. One subset of mobile home parks, retirement communities, restrict residents to those age 55 and older. Another subset of mobile home parks, seasonal communities, are located in popular vacation destinations or are used as a location for summer homes.\n\nNewer homes, particularly double-wides, tend to be built to much higher standards than their predecessors and meet the building codes applicable to most areas. This has led to a reduction in the rate of value depreciation of most used units.\n\nAdditionally, modern homes tend to be built from materials similar to those used in site-built homes rather than inferior, lighter-weight materials. They are also more likely to physically resemble site-built homes. Often, the primary differentiation in appearance is that factory-built homes tend to have less of a roof slope so that they can be readily transported underneath bridges and overpasses.\n\nThe number of double-wide units sold exceeds the number of single-wides, which is due in part to the aforementioned zoning restrictions. Another reason for higher sales is the spaciousness of double-wide units, which are now comparable to site-built homes. Single-wide units are still popular primarily in rural areas, where there are fewer restrictions. They are frequently used as temporary housing in areas affected by natural disasters when restrictions are temporarily waived.\n\nAnother recent trend has been parks in which the owner of the mobile home owns the lot on which their unit is parked. Some of these communities simply provide land in a homogeneous neighborhood, but others are operated more like condominiums with club homes complete with swimming pools and meeting rooms which are shared by all of the residents, who are required to pay membership fees and dues.\n\nMobile home (or mobile-homes) are used in many European campgrounds to refer to fixed caravans, purpose-built cabins, and even large tents, which are rented by the week or even year-round as cheap accommodation, similar to the US concept of a trailer park. Like many US loanwords, this term is not used widely in Britain.\n\nIn the UK static caravans, which have wheels and a rudimentary chassis with no suspension or brakes, are therefore transported on the back of large flatbed lorries, the axle and wheels being used for movement to the final location when the static caravan is moved by tractor or 4x4. A static caravan will normally stay on a single plot for many years, and have many of the modern conveniences one would normally find in a home.\n\nMobile homes are designed and constructed to be transportable by road in one or two sections. Mobile homes are no larger than with an internal maximum height of . Legally, mobile homes can still be defined as \"caravans\".\n\nStatic holiday caravans generally have sleeping accommodation for 6 to 8 people in 2 to 3 bedrooms and on convertible seating in the lounge. They tend towards a fairly \"open-plan\" layout, and while some units are insulated and centrally heated for year-round use, cheaper models without double glazing or central heating are available for mainly summer use. Holiday homes are intended for leisure use and are available in and widths, a small number in and widths, and a few wide, consisting of two wide units joined together. Generally, holiday homes are clad in painted steel panels, but can be clad in PVC panels. Static caravans are sited on caravan parks where the owner of the site leases a plot to the caravan owner. Many of these parks are sited in areas that are prone to flooding and anyone considering buying a sited static caravan needs to take particular care in checking that their site is not liable to flooding. Some park owners used to have unfair conditions in their lease contracts but the Office of Fair Trading has produced a guidance document available for download called Unfair Terms in Holiday Caravan Agreements which aims to stop unfair practices.\n\nMany Israeli settlements and outposts are originally composed of caravans ( \"caravan\"; pl. קראוואנים, \"caravanim\"). They are constructed of light metal, are not insulated but can be outfitted with heating and air-conditioning units, water lines, recessed lighting, and floor tiling to function in a full-service capacity. Starting in 2005, prefabricated homes, named \"caravillas\" (), a portmanteau of the words caravan, and villa, begin to replace mobile homes in many Israeli settlements.\n\nBecause of similarities in the manufacturing process, some companies build both types in their factories. Modular homes are transported on flatbed trucks rather than being towed, and lack axles and an automotive-type frame. However, some of these homes are towed behind a semi-truck or toter on a frame similar to that of a trailer. The home is usually in two pieces and is hauled by two separate trucks. Each frame has five or more axles, depending on the size of the home. Once the home has reached its location, the axles and the tongue of the frame are then removed, and the home is set on a concrete foundation by a large crane.\n\nBoth styles are commonly referred to as factory-built housing, although that term's technical use is restricted to a class of homes regulated by the Federal National Mfd. Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974.\n\nMost zoning restrictions on the homes have been found to be inapplicable or only applicable to modular homes. This occurs often after considerable litigation on the topic by affected jurisdictions and by plaintiffs failing to ascertain the difference. Most modern modulars, once fully assembled, are indistinguishable from site-built homes. Their roofs are usually transported as separate units. Newer modulars also come with roofs that can be raised during the setting process with cranes. There are also modulars with 2 or 3 stories. As the legal differentiation between the two becomes more codified, the market for modular homes is likely to grow.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42543279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42543279", "title": "New Worlds, New Lives", "text": "New Worlds, New Lives\n\nNew Worlds, New Lives: Globalization and People of Japanese Descent in the Americas and from Latin America in Japan () is a 2002 academic book edited by Lane Ryo Hirabayashi, James A. Hirabayashi, and Akemi Kikumura-Yano and published by the Stanford University Press. The volume, edited by three Japanese American anthropologists, was produced by the Japanese American National Museum's International Nikkei Research Project. The same project produced the \"Encyclopedia of Japanese Descendants in the Americas: An Illustrated History of the Nikkei\", and the two books are companion volumes. The book addresses larger theoretical considerations of individual empirical cases as well as the cases themselves. The book was published in Japanese by Jinbun-shoin () in 2006, under the title \"Nikkeijin to gurōbarizēshon : Hokubei, Nanbei, Nihon\" (日系人とグローバリゼーション : 北米, 南米, 日本).\n\n\"New Worlds, New Lives\" discusses the effects of globalization on a Nikkei identity, concerning those from the main islands of Japan and those from Okinawa. This discussion of the Nikkei includes those from the Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Paraguay, Peru and United States, and also the \"dekasegi\", Nikkei who reside in Japan. The editors state that to understand how globalization has affected the Nikkei community one must put together Japan, the originating country, and the overall Nikkei community in a \"triadic perspective\"; According to the book, the \"triadic framework\" means examining Japan, the host country, and the ethnic organizations that link the host country and Japan along with the reproduction and maintenance of Nikkei ethnic identities. Yoko Yoshida of the \"Journal of International Migration and Integration\" wrote that \"The greatest insight one can glean from this book is that only looking at ethnic groups in relation to their host societies does not capture the entire dynamics of the migration experience and the negotiation of cultural identity.\" Ayumi Takenaka of the University of Oxford argued that the book's chapters \"neither address their relationship nor the impact of globalization.\"\n\nThe book considers five results that may occur due to globalization. It may increase the Nikkei identity; erode the Nikkei identity; have no visible impact on the said identity; reduce the prominence of the Nikkei identity by, as Yoshida states, creating \"global consciousness\"; or generate an indicator of a decreasing Nikkei identity by establishing new \"hybrid\" identities. Yoshida wrote that the editors of the book \"fail to answer fully which outcome has emerged because globalization is never consistently conceptualized throughout this book.\"\n\nOf the chapters, half only cite their own case studies and do not cite anything else. Jose C. Moya of the University of California, Los Angeles argued that, in those chapters, this results in \"a certain parochialism in their inability to engage the broader literature on migration and ethnicity.\" Keiko Yamanaka of the University of California, Berkeley wrote that before this book was published, there was scarce information about the Japanese in South America in English, and a lot of the information had been published in Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese, inaccessible to Anglophones.\n\nThe volume, divided into 20 chapters, includes 18 articles. Of the eighteen authors, seventeen are either Japanese or Nikkei. The book's arguments are presented in the second and third sections. The question of conjunction and disjunction of Nikkei identities is presented in sections two and three. Yoshida argued that this was \"an interesting way to frame these sections\".\n\nYamanaka wrote that most chapters have general discussions on their topics and are short in length. Yoshikuni Igarashi of Vanderbilt University stated that the average chapter length was 16 pages, and because of the short length the essays \"read more like encyclopedia entries than critical essays.\" Takenaka argued that concluded that \"most of the chapters seem to address some aspects of conjunction and disjunction of identities in one way or another\" and that the chapters should have been organized by topic or geographic region. Igarashi wrote that the book had organized its nomenclature along country-based boundaries.\n\nThere are four chapters that discuss Peru. One chapter chronicle Japanese Peruvian history, covering from the year 1899 to the rule of Alberto Fujimori. Another chapter refers to one opinion poll of Peruvian Japanese conducted in 1989 and another conducted in 1998 and compares and contrasts the two.\n\nThere is an essay that discusses the Japanese political empowerment movements in three places: Brazil, Hawaii, and Gardena, California in Greater Los Angeles.\n\nThere is also a section where the book discusses the formation of cosmopolitan, hybrid, and transnational identities. Robert Efird of Seattle University stated that the essays by Yuko Takezawa and Makoto Araki examine the boundary of what a \"Nikkei\" is.\n\nThe first section is Part One: The Impact of Globalization on Nikkei Identities. It includes two chapters. Prior to those two chapters is the introduction to part one by Eiichiro Azuma.\n\nHarumi Befu wrote \"Globalization as Human Dispersal: Nikkei in the World\", the introductory chapter, which puts Japanese immigration in a historical context. This chapter is an overview of Japanese immigration from the 15th through the 21st centuries. This chapter argues that the Japanese government encouraged immigration after 1870 in order to relieve pressures of a growing population and Befu believed that the Japanese government had acted in a callous manner towards these immigrants. Befu believes that the emigration policies of Japan had significant influence from the country's desire to gain a prominent position in the international system.\n\nBefu categorizes into three phases the transition of Japanese immigration processes: pre-modern, modernization, and post-World War II. Befu categorizes Japanese immigrants into eight groups: premodern immigrants, pre-World War II immigrants, post-World War II immigrants, war brides, multinational businesspersons and their families, Japanese engaging in marriages to foreigners, and who Igarashi calls \"those who have forsaken Japan\". Befu believes that examining the development of Nikkei communities in relation to the international economic and political structures is the best way of understanding them. Yoshida wrote that \"Nevertheless, the rest of the book lacks a consistent and explicit engagement of this theme and the concept of globalization is used differently in the various works.\"\n\nThe second chapter in Part One is titled \"The Impact of Contemporary Globalization on Nikkei Identities\" and it is written by the volume's three editors.\n\nPart two, titled \"Conjunctions of Nikkei Identities,\" discusses the \"conjunction\" of a Nikkei identity, meaning maintaining and spreading the identity. Part 2 has eight chapters organized into two subparts: \"Community Formations and Linkages\" and \"The Politics of Ethnic Reproduction: Education and Representation.\" The introduction to part two is written by Lloyd Inui.\n\nIn subpart one, Jeffrey Lesser wrote \"In Search of the Hyphen: Nikkei and the Struggle over Brazilian National Identity.\" This chapter discusses the interaction between Brazilian nationalism and the identity politics of Brazil's immigrant groups. Lesser's chapter chronicles the Brazilian Japanese peoples' attempt to find a place in the world society as the \"dekasegi\" can be perceived as foreigners in both Japan and Brazil. The other articles in subpart one are \"Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia: Relief Materials and Nikkei Populations in the United States and Canada\" by Masako Uno, \"An Approach to the Formation of Nikkei Identity in Peru: Issei and Nisei\" by Raúl Araki, and \"The \"Labor Pains\" of Forging a Nikkei Community: A Study of the Santa Cruz Region in Bolivia\" by Kozy Amemiya. Amemiya's essay discusses efforts by the Japanese community in the Santa Cruz region to commemorate their history.\n\nThe articles in subpart two are \"\"The Twain Shall Meet\" in the Nisei? Japanese Language Education and U.S.-Japan Relations, 1900-1940\" by Teruko Kumei, \"The Nikkei's Education in the Japanese Language in Paraguay: The Japanese Educational System and Its Influence on the Colonies\" by Emi Kasamatsu, \"Peruvian Nikkei: A Sociopolitical Portrait\" by Amelia Morimoto, and \"Pathways to Power: Comparative Perspectives on the Emergence of Nikkei Ethnic Political Traditions\" by Lane Ryo Hirabayashi.\n\nYoshida wrote that \"I found that most of the literature cited in the second section lacks a specific link to the theme of globalization and its effects.\"\n\nThe third part, titled, \"Disjunctions of Nikkei Identities,\" discusses globalization-induced \"disjunctions\" of a Nikkei identity. This part, which has a total of nine chapters, is divided into three subparts: \"Gender and Identity,\" \"The Dekasegi Phenomenon,\" and \"Emerging Identities.\" Richard Kosaki wrote the introduction to part three.\n\nIncluded in subpart one is \"I Woman, I Man, I Nikkei: Symbolic Construction of Femininity and Masculinity in the Japanese Community of Peru\" by Doris Moromisato Miasato. Miasato's essay discusses the role of gender in Japanese Peruvian communities. Miasato argues that the Japanese-Brazilian community's patriarchical patterns are hiding a feminine perspective present in the community and that many vital Peruvian Nikkei groups including prefectural associations of \"kenjinkai\". Another chapter compares and contrasts the formations of the Peruvian and United States Nikkei communities in terms of class, nationalism, and race. In addition, the subpart has \"Migration as a Negotiation of Gender: Recent Japanese Immigrant Women in Canada\" by Audrey Kobayashi. This essay, which chronicles Japanese women who had recently emigrated to Canada, argues for a conclusion similar to that of Miasato's. Igarashi stated that both essays show the importance of women in the Nikkei communities. The next article is \"Race, Gender, Ethnicity and the Narrative of National Identity in the Films of Tizuka Yamazaki\" by Naomi Hoki Moniz. This chapter discusses the Brazilian filmmaker Tizuka Yamazaki.\n\nThe first article in the second subpart is \"The Japanese-Brazilian \"Dekasegi\" Phenomenon: An Economic Perspective\" by Edson Mori. The second article is \"The \"Dekasegi\" Phenomenon and the Education of Japanese Brazilian Children in Japanese Schools\" by Masato Ninomiya. This essay is about children of Nikkei Latin Americans living in Japan and their issues in the Japanese educational system. The third article is \"The Emigration of Argentines of Japanese Descent to Japan\" by Marcelo G. Higa.\n\nThe first article in the third subpart is \"The Nikkei Negotiation of Minorit/Majority Dynamics in Peru and the United States\" by Steven Masami Ropp. The second is \"The \"Uchinanchu\" Diaspora and the Boundary of \"Nikkei\"\" by Makoto Arakaki. This essay, a discussion on the specific Okinawan identity, chronicles the use of academic conferences, business conferences, and organizations to create a worldwide Okinawan perspective. The third article is \"Nikkeijin and Multicultural Existence in Japan: Kobe after the Great Earthquake\" by Yasuko I. Takezawa. It discusses the civil responses to the Great Hanshin–Awaji earthquake.\n\nYoshida wrote that compared to the chapters of section two, \"the chapters in section three more convincingly show how Nikkei communities have been affected by globalization.\"\n\nThe concluding essay is \"Retrospect and prospects,\" written by the three editors of the volume. In this chapter the editors wrote that the primary concern of the book is not the experiences of individual ethnic Japanese but instead with the concept of ethnic Japanese communities being \"ethnic reproduction\".\n\nDaniel M. Masterson of the U.S. Naval Academy argued that the book's editors \"are to be complimented for this anthology's important contribution to the field of Japanese migration studies.\"\n\nMoya states that the book is a \"commendable effort\", but that there is a sense of \"conceptual looseness\", or a lack of ability to compare the Nikkei of various countries because the authors did not collect and use the same statistics for all Nikkei groups. Moya concluded that \"the book contains much that should be of interest to the readers of this journal.\"\n\nEfird states that \"not just essential reading for students and scholars of Nikkei issues\" but also is an \"instructive [primer] on the contingency of ethnic identity.\" He argues that the main weakness is \"scant attention to the increasing intermarriage between Nikkei and other ethnic groups.\"\n\nIgarashi argued that while the book's editors successfully created an encyclopedic reference about ethnic Japanese and the recent academic discussions about them, this resource \"remains, regrettably, largely unusable because of their fragmented presentation\", stating that \"the appeal of the collection will likely be limited to a handful of Nikkei readers.\" Igarashi wrote that the book \"reconfirms\" the \"boundaries of the Nikkei\" by trying to create a comprehensive resource and that it is difficult to analyze the cases in the volume due to the amount of information.\n\n\n"}

It hosts the largest concentration of art galleries in the United States outside of Manhattan. \nRiver North has experienced vast changes in the years 1990 - 2012 including the development of vast highrise buildings, nightclubs and restaurants. River North has become one of Chicago's top neighborhoods for nightlife especially on and around Hubbard Street.\n\nA common definition puts the River North neighborhood in the area north of the Chicago River and the Merchandise Mart, south of Division Street, east of the Chicago River and west of Wabash Avenue. Along with hundreds of art galleries, the area holds many bars, dance clubs, popular restaurants and entertainment venues. Subsections of River North include:\n\n\nRiver North was named Smokey Hollow around the turn of the 20th century due to the many factories and forges in the area. The smoke was often so thick that sunlight was blocked. At the time Smokey Hollow was a major transportation hub with railroad tracks linking the ports along the Chicago River with the surrounding areas. The Merchandise Mart still has railroad tracks underneath the building. Massive coal bins were throughout the neighborhood both bringing coal into the area from ships and storage for the multitude of factories and forges in River North. The Merchandise Mart was a major storage warehouse for goods. The Merchandise Mart was later purchased by the Kennedy family. Former retailer Montgomery Ward also had a major transportation and storage facility in River North.\n\nLittle Sicily in Chicago was also located in River North. The city's first Italian Roman Catholic Church in Chicago was Assumption Parish on Illinois Street, with a mandate to be the Parish for all Italians living between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River. Later Sicilians began to move northward from the immediate vicinity of Assumption and began to form their own parishes. Italians whose family roots were from other parts of Italy tended to move west along Grand Street and formed Parishes west of Assumption.\n\nIn 1921, Dean O'Banion married Viola Kaniff and bought an interest in William Schofield's River North flower shop, near the corner of West Chicago Avenue and North State Street. O'Banion needed a legitimate front for his bootlegging operation. In addition, he was fond of flowers and was an excellent arranger.\n\nSchofield's became the florist of choice for many funerals.\n\nThe shop happened to be directly across the street from Holy Name Cathedral, where O'Banion and Weiss attended Mass. The rooms above Schofield's were used as the headquarters for the North Side Gang which controlled the bootlegging operations in what would later be called River North and the Gold Coast area of Chicago.\n\nOn the morning of November 10, 1924, O'Banion was clipping chrysanthemums in Schofield's back room. Frankie Yale entered the shop with Torrio and Capone gunmen John Scalise and Albert Anselmi. When O'Banion attempted to greet Yale with a handshake, Yale clasped O'Banion's hand in a death grip. At the same time, Scalise and Anselmi fired two bullets into O'Banion's chest, two in his cheeks, and two in his throat and Dean O'Banion died instantly.\n\nOne of the biggest punk rock clubs of the 1970s was located in River North - called O'Banion's after the infamous hit on Dean O'Banion.\n\nThe River North neighborhood fell on difficult times starting in the 1960s with many families moving into the suburbs to escape urban blight. Many buildings were torn down and became parking lots. Crime was a dangerous part of daily life.\n\nAssumption Church on Illinois Street during this time reported that many of its Parishioners had moved to the suburbs and that few people remained living within its Parish boundaries as established by the Archdiocese of Chicago. Assumption Parish survived during this time on Parishioners who traveled from the suburbs to attend Mass in the old neighborhood every Sunday.\n\nThe River North neighborhood got its name from Chicago real estate developer Albert Friedman (chief executive of Friedman Properties Ltd.), who in 1974 started to buy, restore and build commercial property in the southeast sector. Much of the area was a skid row at the time, so in an effort to attract tenants Friedman started calling the area \"River North\". Within a few years, Friedman found photographers, ad agencies and art galleries willing to rent the low cost space and coalesce into what is now the River North Gallery District, which has the largest concentration of art galleries in the United States outside of Manhattan.\n\nRiver North from 1990 to 2012 became one of Chicago's top neighborhoods for nightlife especially along Franklin Street and Hubbard Street. It is a top destination for restaurants, nightclubs and living for people who move to Chicago. During this time numerous highrises have been developed, dramatically increasing the population of River North.\n\nThe Consulate-General of the People's Republic of China in Chicago is located at 100 West Erie Street in River North. The consulate's visa office is located in River North but east of the Gallery District, \nThe Royal Thai Consulate-General of Chicago is located at 700 North Rush Street in River North, east of the Gallery District.\n\n"}

Elsie's last words before passing away were \"death is so boring. So Slow. One only waits for it\". At the time of Elsie's death it was reported in the media that he had requested in his will to be buried in Albania. Two weeks after those events, it emerged that Elsie did not specify in his will where to be buried. Instead it was the decision of his life partner Stephan Trierweiler that he be buried in Albania due to the deep love Elsie had for the country. Elsie's coffin was brought to Albania and lay in repose at the National Library in Tirana on Tuesday (Oct.17) for people to come and pay their respects. A farewell ceremony paying tribute to Elsie was held in Tirana that brought together friends, academics and politicians from Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia. Elsie during his lifetime had a fondness for Theth seeing it as an Albanian \"Shangri-La\" and on Wednesday (Oct.18) was buried in the northern village located in the Albanian Alps. A prolific author of scholarly works, Elsie's untimely death within the context of Albanian studies is seen as a \"big blow\" for its international promotion.\n\nElsie was a writer, translator, interpreter, and specialist in Albanian studies, being the author of numerous books and articles that focused on various aspects of Albanian culture and affairs.\n\nBelow are a selection of his publications of which he was an author, editor or translator.

Founder of the Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education, Chan has known the 14th Dalai Lama since 1972. Co-author with him of two essays, he also wrote a guide of pilgrimage to Tibet. He lives in Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nVictor Chan was born in 1945 in Hong Kong which he left at the age of 20 years. He continued his education in Canada and the United States. He performed his graduate studies at the Enrico Fermi Institute of the University of Chicago in the field of particle physics.\n\nIn 1971, after his studies, Chan traveled to Europe in a van. His route took him to the Netherlands to Turkey, and then through Iran and Afghanistan. During the travel, he was joined by two women, Cheryl Crosby, an American, and Rita, a German. In Kabul, they were taken in hostage until the vehicle of hijackers crashed, allowing them to escape. Cheryl Crosby, a New York Buddhist practitioner, proposed Chan to go to Dharamshala in India, where they arrived in March 1972. Cheryl had a letter of introduction to meet the Dalai Lama to discuss meditation. After answering her questions, the Dalai Lama turned to Victor Chan. Chan asked him if he hated the Chinese. He unhesitatingly replied negatively, explaining that he had forgiven the Chinese and did not blame the Chinese people. Victor Chan became a close friend of the Dalai Lama.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1988, he lived 4 years in Nepal, using Kathmandu as a base to travel to Tibet. In 1984, Chan made his first visit there, traveling 42,000 kilometers by foot, horse, yak, coracle, truck and bus. He returned in 1990 and traveled some of the main paths of sacred Tibetan pilgrimage, including Kailash, Tsari and Lapchi, the 3 most sacred mountains. He then left Tibet and began to write. After 5 years of research in Europe, he published his guide to Tibet in 1994, a book he presented to the Dalai Lama in London the same year, 22 years after their last meeting. Professor Michael Aris wrote that this is the most detailed and comprehensive guide to Tibet, a landmark work of an worthy successor of the great explorers of the nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1999, Victor Chan asked the Dalai Lama if he could collaborate on a book.\n\nFor this book, \"The Wisdom of Forgiveness\", originally published in English in 2004, and translated into 14 languages. Victor Chan has recorded hundreds of hours in the company of the Dalai Lama, following him in his travels around the world for conferences and Buddhist ceremonies, and realized dozens of daily interviews at his residence in Dharamsala, India, observing, discussing with him and witnessing private audiences granted to personalities. When the Dalai Lama was asked why he allowed Chan to follow his life so closely, he explained: \"His parents are Chinese. He grew up in Western atmosphere, but he is Chinese. I always believe in understanding. The Chinese living in America, it is very, very important to have one single Chinese, to have close contact, and a better understanding of Tibetans. Whenever they find opportunities to meet Chinese brothers and sisters showing interest in me and Tibet, to tell them the truth. I'm very happy. Secondly, (Victor) came to Dharamsala several meetings, on a few occasions he showed very strong emotions, so that means he's very sincere, not artificial, not cheating. Heart sincerity, that's important\". From the book, the two men are good friends.\n\nWith Pitman B. Potter, director of the Institute of Asian Research at the University of British Columbia, Victor Chan organized a symposium from 17 to 20 April 2004, at the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts Vancouver on the theme of peace and reconciliation. He invited the Dalai Lama to Canada where his last visit had 10 years previously. Two other Nobel laureates, Desmond Tutu, a longtime friend of the Dalai Lama, and Shirin Ebadi, gave each a conference. Václav Havel, another longtime friend of the Dalai Lama initially invited, canceled his visit at the last minute due to medical reason. Paul Ekman, who attended the event in the public reports that Dr. Jo-Ann Archibald, Indian North America, and Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi also pronounced a speech. Canadian Anglican Bishop Michael Ingham was moderator of the discussion that closed the conference. Pico Iyer, who attended the conference as a journalist, wrote a detailed account of it in his book .\n\nWith Pitman B. Potter, Victor Chan founded a Tibetan studies program.,\n\nApart from the Dalai Lama to Vancouver three times in 2004, 2006, and 2009, he also invited celebrities such as Desmond Tutu, Matthieu Ricard, Mia Farrow, Jane Goodall, Peter Buffett, Daniel Goleman, Daniel J. Siegel, Ela Bhatt, Shirin Ebadi, Karen Armstrong, Stephen Covey, Kim Campbell, le Blue Man Group, Maria Shriver, Michaelle Jean, Ken Robinson, Murray Gell-Mann, Mary Robinson, Jody Williams, Mairead Maguire, Robert Putnam, Reginald Ray and Bob Geldof\nVictor Chan founded the Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education in Vancouver in 2005. Chan's efforts led to the creation of an institution that, according to Douglas Todd has become a force field for global change - with a particular focus on education reform, global philanthropy and promoting women's rights.\n\nIn 2013 he published with the Dalai Lama \"The Wisdom of Compassion\", which addresses, in particular, the scientific study of meditation on compassion. For Craig Kielburger and Marc Kielburger, the center of Victor Chan plays a key role in enabling the Vancouver School Board to be at the forefront of teaching on compassion and social responsibility Education in Canada.\nVictor Chan married East German landscape designer Suzanne Martin around 1994 with whom he had two daughters, Kira and Lina.,\n\nVictor Chan is a member of the Advisory Board of the American NGO International Campaign for Tibet.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1368825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1368825", "title": "Widow Twankey", "text": "Widow Twankey\n\nWidow Twankey is a female character in the pantomime \"Aladdin\". The character is a pantomime dame, portrayed by a man; and is a comic foil to the principal boy, Aladdin—played by an actress.\n\nThe story of Aladdin is drawn from the \"Arabian Nights\", a collection of Middle-Eastern fables. It was first published in England between 1704 and 1714; and this story was dramatised in 1788 by John O'Keefe for Covent Garden. In 1813, a comic character of the \"dumb slave\" was introduced to \"Aladdin, or the Wonderful Lamp\", as a vehicle for the clown, Joseph Grimaldi, and at the same time, a washer-woman, \"Ching Mustapha\" was introduced to the play.\n\nWidow Twankey first occurs in 1861; the character runs a Chinese laundry in Peking, China and is a pantomime dame; that is, always played by a man. One of her sons, Aladdin, is the hero of the pantomime, while her other son, often named Wishy Washy (or Wishee Washee), just helps in the laundry. She is not pivotal in the plot (such as it is), but more a source of interaction with the audience through jokes and innuendo – mostly centred on items of underwear on the washing line.\n\nThe character has had a number of different names over the years: \"Ching Mustapha\" was followed by \"Wee Ping\", \"Chow Chow\", and \"Tan King\". In 1861, the character became the Widow Twankay – named after a cheap blend of China tea. \"Twankay\", or 'twankey' is an inferior grade of green tea, with an old, ragged, open leaf – the implication is that the widow is 'past her best' — with the name Twankay deriving from Tunxi in Anhui, from where the tea in China originates. Occasionally, the spelling of her name in the programme (but not the pronunciation on the stage) is varied to make it look more like a \"Chinese\" personal name – e.g., \"Tuang Kee Chung\" in a 1979 musical version.\n\nThe story is located in a mythical China, but with many Arabic ideas, names and places which betray its Middle-Eastern origins. In some productions, the Chinese laundry is located in Limehouse, in the East End of London. There was a considerable chinatown located here, since the early 19th century, to serve the needs of Chinese seamen. The area became infamous through exaggerated reports of opium dens and slum housing. Since the destruction of World War II, it has relocated to Soho.\n\nJoseph Grimaldi took many of the early female roles in pantomimes at Drury Lane. He was notable for introducing the pantomime dame, and the tradition of audience participation and community singing. He was a specialist in physical comedy; particularly tumbling and falling. The first \"Widow Twankey\" was played by James Rogers at the Strand Theatre on 1 April 1861, in an 'extravanganza' by H. J. Byron, \"Aladdin or The Wonderful Scamp\" – this play also featured a character named Pekoe. \n\nThe comedian Dan Leno portrayed Widow Twankey from 1896 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, with Marie Lloyd in the role of principal boy – Aladdin. Leno introduced dancing and long monologues with the audience to the role – bringing the then popular music hall into pantomime.\n\nAladdin continues as a part of the repertoire of the Christmas season. Today, the dame is often played by popular television stars, but in 2004 and 2005, Sir Ian McKellen played the part of Widow Twankey at the Old Vic. This reintroduced a tradition of senior classical actors playing pantomime, which was originally played in the theatrical off-season between December and April. This script was heavy with adult innuendo such as \"I've got something cheesy bubbling in my oven\" and \"your front porch could do with a good lick\". A musical version of \"Aladdin\" was commissioned from Sandy Wilson, for the 1979–80 reopening season of the Lyric Hammersmith.\n\nRobert Bathurst, Kenneth Connor, Karen Dunbar, Melvyn Hayes, Sean Mathias, George Herbert Rogers, and Michael Fenton Stevens also have appeared in the role.\n\nA character named \"Widow Twanky\" was also portrayed by Michael Hurst (credited as \"Edith Sidebottom\") in three \"\" episodes. First in the season four episode \"...and Fancy Free\", followed by the episode \"Men in Pink\". He later reprised the role for the final time in a season five episode entitled \"Greece Is Burning\". The character of Widow Twanky is a diva, married at least 12 times, and a teacher of dance.\n"}
{"id": "409576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=409576", "title": "Witold Lutosławski", "text": "Witold Lutosławski\n\nWitold Roman Lutosławski (; 25 January 1913 – 7 February 1994) was a Polish composer and orchestral conductor. He was one of the major European composers of the 20th century, and one of the preeminent Polish musicians during his last three decades. He earned many international awards and prizes. His compositions (of which he was a notable conductor) include four symphonies, a Concerto for Orchestra, a string quartet, instrumental works, concertos, and orchestral song cycles.\n\nDuring his youth, Lutosławski studied piano and composition in Warsaw. His early works were influenced by Polish folk music. His style demonstrates a wide range of rich atmospheric textures. He began developing his own characteristic composition techniques in the late 1950s. His music from this period onwards incorporates his own methods of building harmonies from small groups of musical intervals. It also uses aleatoric processes, in which the rhythmic coordination of parts is subject to an element of chance.\n\nDuring World War II, after escaping German capture, Lutosławski made a living by playing the piano in Warsaw bars. After the war, Stalinist authorities banned his First Symphony for being \"formalist\"—allegedly accessible only to an elite. Lutosławski believed such anti-formalism was an unjustified retrograde step, and he resolutely strove to maintain his artistic integrity. In the 1980s, Lutosławski gave artistic support to the Solidarity movement. Near the end of his life, he was awarded the Order of the White Eagle, Poland's highest honour.\n\nLutosławski's parents were both born into the Polish landed nobility. His family owned estates in the area of Drozdowo. His father Józef was involved in the Polish National Democratic Party (\"Endecja\"), and the Lutosławski family became intimate with its founder, Roman Dmowski (Witold Lutosławski's middle name was Roman). Józef Lutosławski studied in Zürich, where in 1904 he met and married a fellow student, Maria Olszewska, who later became Lutosławski's mother. Józef pursued his studies in London, where he acted as correspondent for the National-Democratic newspaper, \"Goniec\". He continued to be involved in National Democracy politics after returning to Warsaw in 1905, and took over the management of the family estates in 1908. Witold Roman Lutosławski, the youngest of three brothers, was born in Warsaw shortly before the outbreak of World War I. In 1915, with Russia at war with Germany, Prussian forces drove towards Warsaw. The Lutosławskis travelled east to Moscow, where Józef remained politically active, organising Polish Legions ready for any action that might liberate Poland (which was divided according to the 1815 Congress of Vienna—Warsaw was part of Tsarist Russia). Dmowski's strategy was for Russia to guarantee security for a new Polish state. However, in 1917, the February Revolution forced the Tsar to abdicate, and the October Revolution started a new Soviet government that made peace with Germany. Józef's activities were now in conflict with the Bolsheviks, who arrested him and his brother Marian. Thus, although fighting stopped on the Eastern Front in 1917, the Lutosławskis were prevented from returning home. The brothers were interned in Butyrskaya prison in central Moscow, where Witold—by then aged five—visited his father. Józef and Marian were executed by a firing squad in September 1918, some days before their scheduled trial.\n\nAfter the war, the family returned to the newly independent Poland, only to find their estates ruined. After his father's death, other members of the family played an important part in his early life, especially Józef's half-brother Kazimierz Lutosławski – priest and politician.\n\nLutosławski started piano lessons in Warsaw for two years from the age of six. After the Polish-Soviet War the family left Warsaw to return to Drozdowo, but after a few years of running the estates with limited success, his mother returned to Warsaw. She worked as a physician, and translated books for children from English. In 1924 Lutosławski entered secondary school (Stefan Batory Gymnasium) while continuing piano lessons. A performance of Karol Szymanowski's \"Third Symphony\" deeply affected him. In 1925 he started violin lessons at the Warsaw Music School. In 1931 he enrolled at Warsaw University to study mathematics, and in 1932 he formally joined the composition classes at the Conservatory. His only composition teacher was Witold Maliszewski, a renowned Polish composer who had been a pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Lutosławski was given a strong grounding in musical structures, particularly movements in sonata form. In 1932 he gave up the violin, and in 1933 he discontinued his mathematics studies to concentrate on the piano and composition. As a student of Jerzy Lefeld, he gained a diploma for piano performance from the Conservatory in 1936, after presenting a virtuoso program including Schumann's \"Toccata\" and Beethoven's fourth piano concerto. His diploma for composition was awarded by the same institution in 1937.\n\nMilitary service followed—Lutosławski was trained in signalling and radio operating in Zegrze near Warsaw. He completed his \"Symphonic Variations\" in 1939, and the work was premiered by the Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Grzegorz Fitelberg, and this performance was broadcast on radio on 9 March 1939. Like most young Polish composers, Lutosławski wanted to continue his education in Paris. His plans for further musical study were dashed in September 1939, when Germany invaded western Poland and Russia invaded eastern Poland. Lutosławski was mobilised with the radio unit for the Kraków Army. He was soon captured by German soldiers, but he escaped while being marched to prison camp, and walked back to Warsaw. Lutosławski's brother was captured by Russian soldiers and later died in a Siberian labour camp.\n\nTo earn a living, Lutosławski joined as an arranger-pianist \"Dana Ensemble\", the first Polish revellers, singing in \"Ziemiańska Cafe\". Then he formed a piano duo with friend and fellow composer Andrzej Panufnik, and they performed together in Warsaw cafés. Their repertoire consisted of a wide range of music in their own arrangements, including the first incarnation of Lutosławski's \"Paganini Variations\", a highly original transcription of the 24th Caprice for solo violin by Niccolò Paganini. Defiantly, they even sometimes played Polish music (the Nazis banned Polish music in Poland—including Chopin), and composed Resistance songs. Listening in cafés was the only way in which the Poles of German-occupied Warsaw could hear live music; putting on concerts was impossible since the Germans occupying Poland prohibited any organised gatherings. In café \"Aria\", where they played, Lutosławski met his future wife Maria Danuta Bogusławska, a sister of the writer Stanisław Dygat.\n\nLutosławski left Warsaw in July 1944 with his mother, merely a few days before the Warsaw Uprising, salvaging only a few scores and sketches—the rest of his music was lost during the complete destruction of the city by Germans after the fall of uprising, as were the family's Drozdowo estates. Of the 200 or so arrangements that Lutosławski and Panufnik had worked on for their piano duo, only Lutosławski's \"Paganini Variations\" survived. Lutosławski returned to the ruins of Warsaw after the Polish-Soviet treaty in April 1945.\n\nDuring the postwar years, Lutosławski worked on his first symphony—sketches of which he had salvaged from Warsaw—which he had started in 1941 and which was first performed in 1948, conducted by Fitelberg. To provide for his family, he also composed music that he termed \"functional\", such as the \"Warsaw Suite\" (written to accompany a silent film depicting the city's reconstruction), sets of \"Polish Carols\", and the study pieces for piano, \"Melodie Ludowe\" (\"Folk Melodies\").\n\nIn 1945, Lutosławski was elected as secretary and treasurer of the newly constituted (ZKP—\"Związek Kompozytorów Polskich\"). In 1946, he married Danuta Bogusławska. The marriage was a lasting one, and Danuta's drafting skills were of great value to the composer: she became his copyist, and she solved some of the notational challenges of his later works.\n\nIn 1947, the Stalinist political climate led to the adoption and imposition by the ruling Polish United Workers' Party of the tenets of Socialist realism, and the authorities' condemnation of modern music which was deemed to be non-conformist. This artistic censorship, which ultimately came from Stalin personally, was to some degree prevalent over the whole Eastern bloc, and was reinforced by the 1948 Zhdanov decree. By 1948, the ZKP was taken over by musicians willing to follow the party line on musical matters, and Lutosławski resigned from the committee. He was implacably opposed to the ideas of Socialist realism. His \"First Symphony\" was proscribed as \"formalist\", and he found himself shunned by the Soviet authorities, a situation that continued throughout the era of Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko. In 1954, the climate of musical oppression drove his friend Andrzej Panufnik to defect to the United Kingdom. Against this background, Lutosławski was content to compose pieces for which there was social need, but in 1954 this earned him—much to the composer's chagrin—the Prime Minister's Prize for a set of children's songs. He commented: \"[I]t was for those functional compositions of mine that the authorities decorated me ... I realised that I was not writing indifferent little pieces, only to make a living, but was carrying on an artistic creative activity in the eyes of the outside world.\"\n\nIt was his substantial and original Concerto for Orchestra of 1954 that established Lutosławski as an important composer of art music. The work, commissioned in 1950 by the conductor Witold Rowicki for the newly reconstituted Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, earned the composer two state prizes in the following year.\n\nStalin's death in 1953 allowed a certain relaxation of the cultural totalitarianism in Russia and its satellite states. By 1956, political events had led to a partial thawing of the musical climate, and the Warsaw Autumn Festival of Contemporary Music was founded. Conceived as a biennial festival, it has been held annually ever since 1958 (except under Martial law in 1982 when, in protest, the ZKP refused to organise it). The first performance of his \"Musique funèbre\" (in Polish, \"Muzyka żałobna\", English \"Funereal Music\" or \"Music of Mourning\") took place in 1958. It was written to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the death of Béla Bartók, but took the composer four years to complete. This work brought international recognition, the annual ZKP prize and the International Rostrum of Composers prize in 1959. Lutosławski's harmonic and contrapuntal thinking were developed in this work, and in the \"Five songs\" of 1956–57, as he introduced his twelve-note system, the fruits of many years of thought and experiment. He established another feature of his compositional technique, which became a Lutosławski signature, when he began introducing randomness into the exact synchronisation of various parts of the musical ensemble in \"Jeux vénitiens\" (\"Venetian games\"). These harmonic and temporal techniques became part of every subsequent work, and integral to his style.\n\nIn a departure from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym \"Derwid\". Mostly waltzes, tangos, foxtrots and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish \"actors' songs\". Their place in Lutosławski's output may be seen as less incongruous given his own performances of cabaret music during the war, and in the light of his relationship by marriage to the famous Polish cabaret singer Kalina Jędrusik (who was his wife's sister-in-law).\n\nIn 1963, Lutosławski fulfilled a commission for the Music Biennale Zagreb, his \"Trois poèmes d'Henri Michaux\" for chorus and orchestra. It was the first work he had written for a commission from abroad, and brought him further international acclaim. It earned him a second State Prize for music (Lutosławski was not cynical about the award this time), and Lutosławski gained an agreement for the international publication of his music with Chester Music, then part of the Hansen publishing house. His String Quartet was first performed in Stockholm in 1965, followed the same year by the first performance of his orchestral song-cycle \"Paroles tissées\". This shortened title was suggested by the poet , who had published the poems as \"Quatre tapisseries pour la Châtelaine de Vergi\". The song cycle is dedicated to the tenor Peter Pears, who first performed it at the 1965 Aldeburgh Festival with the composer conducting. The Aldeburgh Festival was founded and organised by Benjamin Britten, with whom the composer formed a lasting friendship.\n\nShortly after this, Lutosławski started work on his Second Symphony, which had two premieres: Pierre Boulez conducted the second movement, \"Direct\", in 1966, and when the first movement, \"Hésitant\", was finished in 1967, the composer conducted a complete performance in Katowice. The \"Second Symphony\" is very different from a conventional classical symphony in structure, but Lutosławski used all of his technical innovations up to that point to build a large-scale, dramatic work worthy of the name. In 1968, the work earned Lutosławski first prize from the International Music Council's International Rostrum of Composers, his third such award, which confirmed his growing international reputation. In 1967 Lutosławski was awarded the Léonie Sonning Music Prize, Denmark's highest musical honour.\n\nThe \"Second Symphony\", and \"Livre pour orchestre\" and the \"Cello Concerto\" which followed, were composed during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski's life. His mother died in 1967, and in 1967–70 there was a great deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production \"Dziady\", which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring, and the Gdańsk Shipyards strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the \"Cello Concerto\" of 1968–70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society. Indeed, Rostropovich's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a direct effect on his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree. In any case, the \"Cello Concerto\" was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades. At the work's première with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Bliss presented Rostropovich with the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal.\n\nIn 1973, Lutosławski attended a recital given by the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau with the pianist Sviatoslav Richter in Warsaw; he met the singer after the concert and this inspired him to write his extended orchestral song \"Les espaces du sommeil\" (\"The spaces of sleep\"). This work, \"Preludes and Fugue\", \"Mi-Parti\" (a French expression that roughly translates as \"divided into two equal but different parts\"), \"Novelette\", and a short piece for cello in honour of Paul Sacher's seventieth birthday, occupied Lutosławski throughout the 1970s, while in the background he was working away at a projected third symphony and a \"concertante\" piece for the oboist Heinz Holliger. These latter pieces were proving difficult to complete as Lutosławski struggled to introduce greater fluency into his sound world and to reconcile tensions between the harmonic and melodic aspects of his style, and between foreground and background. The Double Concerto for oboe, harp and chamber orchestra—commissioned by Paul Sacher—was finally finished in 1980, and the Third Symphony in 1983. In 1977 he received the Order of the Builders of People's Poland. In 1983 he received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize.\n\nDuring this period, Poland was undergoing yet more upheaval: in 1980, the influential movement Solidarność was created, led by Lech Wałęsa; and in 1981, martial law was declared by General Wojciech Jaruzelski. From 1981–89, Lutosławski refused all professional engagements in Poland as a gesture of solidarity with the artists' boycott. He refused to enter the Culture Ministry to meet any of the ministers, and was careful not be photographed in their company. In 1983, as a gesture of support, he sent a recording of the first performance (in Chicago) of the \"Third Symphony\" to Gdańsk to be played to strikers in a local church. In 1983, he was awarded the Solidarity prize, of which Lutosławski was reported to be more proud than any other of his honours.\n\nHe also bought a house in Oslo and had a cabin in the Norwegian countryside. He and his wife would stay here several times a year to be near her son from an earlier marriage, who was a Norwegian citizen.\n\nThrough the mid-1980s, Lutosławski composed three pieces called \"Łańcuch\" (\"Chain\"), which refers to the way the music is constructed from contrasting strands which overlap like the links of a chain. \"Chain 2\" was written for Anne-Sophie Mutter (commissioned by Paul Sacher), and for Mutter he also orchestrated his slightly earlier \"Partita\" for violin and piano, providing a new linking Interlude, so that when played together the Partita, Interlude and \"Chain 2\" form his longest work.\n\nThe Third Symphony earned Lutosławski the first Grawemeyer Prize from the University of Louisville, Kentucky, awarded in 1985. The significance of the prize lay not just in its prestige—other eminent nominations have included Elliott Carter and Michael Tippett—but in the size of its financial award (then US$150,000). The intention of the award is to remove recipients' financial concerns for a period to allow them to concentrate on serious composition. In a gesture of altruism, Lutosławski announced that he would use the fund to set up a scholarship to enable young Polish composers to study abroad; Lutosławski also directed that his fee from the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra for \"Chain 3\" should go to this scholarship fund.\n\nIn 1987 Lutosławski was presented (by Michael Tippett) with the rarely awarded Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal during a concert in which Lutosławski conducted his Third Symphony; also that year a major celebration of his work was made at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival. In addition, he was awarded honorary doctorates at several universities worldwide, including Cambridge.\n\nLutosławski was at this time writing his Piano Concerto for Krystian Zimerman, commissioned by the Salzburg Festival. His earliest plans to write a piano concerto dated from 1938; he was himself in his younger days a virtuoso pianist. It was a performance of this work and the Third Symphony at the Warsaw Autumn Festival in 1988 that marked the composer's return to the conductor's podium in Poland, after substantive talks had been arranged between the government and the opposition.\n\nLutosławski also, around 1990, worked on a fourth symphony and his orchestral song-cycle \"Chantefleurs et Chantefables\" for soprano. The latter was first performed at a Prom concert in London in 1991, and the Fourth Symphony in 1993 with the composer conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic. In between, and after initial reluctance, Lutosławski took on the presidency of the newly reconstituted \"Polish Cultural Council\". This had been set up after the reforms in 1989 in Poland brought about by the almost total support for Solidarity in the elections of that year, and the subsequent end of communist rule and the reinstatement of Poland as an independent republic rather than the communist state of the People's Republic of Poland.\nHe continued his busy schedule, travelling to the United States, England, Finland, Canada and Japan, and sketching a violin concerto, but by the first week of 1994 it was clear that cancer had taken hold, and after an operation the composer weakened quickly and died on 7 February at the age of eighty-one. He had, a few weeks before, been awarded Poland's highest honour, the Order of the White Eagle (only the second person to receive this since the collapse of communism in Poland—the first had been Pope John Paul II). He was cremated; his wife Danuta died shortly afterwards.\n\nLutosławski described musical composition as a search for listeners who think and feel the same way he did—he once called it \"fishing for souls\".\n\nA complete list of Lutosławski's compositions in chronological order can be found at \"The Polish Music Center\".\n\nLutosławski's works up until and including the \"Dance Preludes\" clearly show the influence of Polish folk music, both harmonically and melodically. Part of his art was in transforming folk music, rather than quoting it exactly. In some cases, folk music is unrecognisable as such without careful analysis, for example, in the Concerto for Orchestra. As Lutosławski developed the techniques of his mature compositions, he stopped using folk material explicitly, although its influence remained as subtle features until the end. As he said, \"[in those days] I could not compose as I wished, so I composed as I was able\", and about this change of direction he said, \"I was simply not so interested in it [using folk music]\". Also, Lutosławski was dissatisfied with composing in a \"post-tonal\" idiom: while composing the first symphony, he felt that this was for him a \"cul-de-sac\".\n\nIn \"Five Songs\" (1956–57) and \"Musique funèbre\" (1958) Lutosławski introduced his own brand of twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in \"Musique funèbre\", augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although \"Musique funèbre\"' does happen to be based on a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and \"Paganini Variations\".\n\nAlthough \"Musique funèbre\" was internationally acclaimed, his new harmonic techniques led to something of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's \"Concert for Piano and Orchestra\". Although he was not influenced by the sound or the philosophy of the music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His \"Three Postludes\" were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.\n\nIn works from \"Jeux vénitiens\", Lutosławski wrote long passages in which the parts of the ensemble are not to be synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor, each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way, the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term \"aleatory\" are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.\n\nFor his String Quartet, Lutosławski had produced only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind them in a full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, as is the case with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called \"mobiles\"), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor.\n\nLutosławski's called this technique of his mature period \"limited aleatorism\". This controlled freedom given to the individual musicians is contrasted with passages where the orchestra is asked to synchronise their parts; the score for these passages is notated conventionally using bars (measures) and time signatures.\n\nBoth Lutosławski's harmonic and aleatory processes are illustrated by \"example 1\", an excerpt from \"Hésitant\", the first movement of the Symphony No. 2. At number 7, the conductor gives a cue to the flutes, celesta and percussionist, who then play their parts in their own time, without any attempt to synchronise with the other instrumentalists. The harmony of this section is based on a 12-note chord built from major seconds and perfect fourths. After all the instrumentalists have finished their parts, a two-second general pause is indicated. The conductor then gives a cue at number 8 (and indicates the tempo of the following section) for two oboes and the cor anglais. They each play their part, again with no attempt to synchronise with the other players. The harmony of this part is based on the hexachord F–G–A–C–D–D, arranged in such a way that the harmony of the section never includes any sixths or thirds. When the conductor gives another cue at number 9, the players each continue until they reach the repeat sign, and then stop: they are unlikely to end the section at the same time. This \"refrain\" (from numbers 8 to 9) recurs throughout the movement, slightly altered each time, but always played by double-reed instruments which do not play elsewhere in the movement: Lutosławski thus also carefully controls the orchestral palette.\n\nThe combination of Lutosławski's aleatory techniques and his harmonic discoveries allowed him to build up complex musical textures. According to Bodman Rae, in his later works Lutosławski evolved a more mobile, simpler, harmonic style, in which less of the music is played with an \"ad libitum\" coordination. This development first appeared in the brief \"Epitaph\" for oboe and piano, around the time Lutosławski was struggling to find the technical means to complete his Third Symphony. In chamber works for just two instrumentalists the scope for aleatory counterpoint and dense harmonies is significantly less than for orchestra, but these developments also influenced his orchestral style in late works including the Piano Concerto, \"Chantefleurs et Chantefables\", \"Chain 2\" and the \"Fourth Symphony\", which require mostly conventional coordination.\n\nLutosławski's formidable technical developments grew out of his creative imperative; that he left a lasting body of major compositions is a testament to his resolution of purpose in the face of the anti-formalist authorities under which he formulated his methods.\n\nLutosławski's life, as well as detailed and thorough discussion of Lutosławski's music and compositional techniques, can be found in both Stucky (1981) and Bodman Rae (1994, 1996, 1999), but also in \"Witold Lutosławski – Guide to Warsaw\" (2013) by the National Institute of Fryderyk Chopin.\n\n\n\n"}
