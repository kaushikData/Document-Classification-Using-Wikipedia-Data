The event was attended by over a hundred people, mostly from Asia.\n\nThere are some theses on why the Commons idea in Asia would be different from those elsewhere. For example: \nMore specifically, the term Asia Commons is the movement to create and sustain the Commons in Asia.\n\nThere are many type of commons, but the focus could be divided basically into two—natural resources, and man-made resources.\n\nThe commons is: \n\nThe open/free, participatory/p2p, and commons are a related the three-legged stool of paradigms: \n\nAsia Commons, or the Asian Conference on the Digital Commons, was a conference held between June 6 to 8, 2006 in Bangkok, Thailand. Its website says that during the past two decades, the \"level, scope, territorial extent, and role of copyrights and patents have expanded into new sectors, often without development considerations\".\n\nThe conference discussed issues pertaining to the Asian Digital Commons, Free/Libre and Open Source Software, business models and collaborative models, Intellectual Property Rights, patents, copyrights, copylefts, the grey economy and its impact on the Asian \"developing world\", ideas of the Creative Commons, alternate law practices, access to knowledge (a2k), Open Access, open alternatives, peer-to-peer (P2P) practices and open standards.\n\nThe Asia Commons event was aimed at creating \"many opportunities where deep discussions and exchange can happen\". The conference organisers said they \"recognise that all participants have experience and ideas that are relevant and as a result, expect them to contribute to the discussions on issues and topics of interest.\"\n\nOrganisers said (in a conference kit presented to participants) that through an exchange of experience and knowledge, the Asia Commons conference aimed at bringing participants together to:\n\n\nSome 137 participants were listed to take part in the event. They came in from a range of countries from Asia (Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong (PRC), India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Uzbekistan, Vietnam) and beyond (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, Fiji, Georgia, Ghana, Israel, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, UK, the United States, Zambia and Zimbabwe).\n\nSome of the organisations represented in this meet included the International Open Source Network (IOSN), BytesForAll, FOSSFP: Free and Open Source Software Foundation of Pakistan, the Internet Archive, UNESCO, the Bangalore (India)-based Alternative Law Forum, Open Forum of Cambodia, the Open Source Software Foundry of the Academia Sinica's Institute of Information Science, the US-based Consumer Project on Technology, the Association for Progressive Communications, the P2P Foundation based in Thailand, the Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication, Creative Commons Israel, and the Korean Progressive Network Center.\n\nParticipants were encouraged to join in the conference documentation through the wiki, blogs, and photo galleries. Prior to the event, a mailing-list was launched, which is still functioning at the time of writing (in mid-June). Its archives are available online.\n\nA full listing of conference participants, including profiles, is available.\n\nSome of the speakers included Peter Drahos of the Australian National University and Jamie Love of the Consumer Project on Technology, both of whom were joint keynote speakers. Bangalore based lawyer of the Alternate Law Forum Lawrence Liang, independent writer and researcher Vijayalakshmi Balakrishnan of New Delhi, Dr N.S. Gopalakrishnan of the Cochin University of Science and Technology and Choong Hee Lee of the Seoul National University were among the other speakers. The participatory spectogram session on \"Patents and Innovation\" included as keynote speakers, FOSS advocate Fouad Riaz Bajwa of Free and Open Source Foundation of Pakistan (FOSSFP) and advocate Rahul Matthan of Trilegal, India with the session led by Laurent Elder of IDRC.\n\nThere were sessions on \"History of the Commons, Evolution of Copyright and the Emergence of the Digital Economy: Exploring the Relationships\", \"Copyright and the Information Grey Economy: A Regional Comparison\", \"Patents and Innovation\", and \"Open Business Models\".\n\nUsing the \"speed sharing\" model, there was also a session on collaborative projects. Each speaker, talked to small groups of participants, and had just three minutes in which to explain their work and concepts. This was followed by a session of 'round tables' on the issue of collaborative models: factors that lead to successful collaborations, opportunities and challenges.\n\nTowards the end, the focus shifted to building an overview of the Asia Commons—ideas and issues, issues and opportunities, what could be done to move forward, and what is being moved forward.\n\nThis event was organised at the Chaophya Park Hotel and organised by Bellanet International Secretariat, the Delhi-based Centre for Science, Development and Media Studies (CSDMS), South Asia Partnership International, and the United Nations Development Programme Asia Pacific Development Information Programme's International Open Source Network (IOSN).\n\nThis event was financially supported by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada and UNDP APDIP's International Open Source Network (IOSN). Local partners in organising the event were the Asian Institute of Technology based in Bangkok and the Thai Rural Net (TRN).\n\nIt was a Global Knowledge Partnership (GKP) members' event.\n\nThis event used the 'open space' approach to focus on issues of relevance.\n\nAs defined elsewhere in the Wikipedia: \"Open Space Technology enables groups of any size to address complex, important issues and achieve meaningful results quickly. It is at its best where more traditional meeting formats fail: when there is conflict, complexity, diversity of thought or people and short decision times. It has been used in widely diverse settings, from designing airplane doors at a large airplane manufacturing company to engaging street kids in defining a sustainable jobs program. Originated by Harrison Owen in 1986, Open Space has been used in over 100 countries and in diverse settings, industries, cultures and situations - for program and product design, knowledge exchange, interdisciplinary thinking, conflict resolution and conferences.\"\n\nOrganisers of the event were quoted as saying that they had doubts whether the Open Space approach would be suitable in Asia. But it was.\n\n\nOne of the issues to emerge from the meeting was a regional (Asia-wide) focus on Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS, or FOSS). Diosdado \"Dong\" Calmada of the Philippines held a session with this concern. He was keen to look at why Asia had so many GNU/Linux user groups, but seldom seemed to care about the big picture. This region, he suggested, was too concerned about its own technical problems. \"There's a need to broaden the perspective of our groups. After all, LUGs (Linux-user groups) are potent forces,\" he was quoted as saying. It was felt that Asia, with all its tech skills and software talent, is all but invisible in the world of Free Software and Open Source. People do not link up with one another, within countries or across borders. There's little communication happening within the otherwise successful FOSS movement across this vast continent.\n\nMichel Bauwens of the P2PFoundation, which has a wide variety of links to P2P or peer-to-peer networking examples, explained his perspective saying, \"The basic idea I had was that there's a new social movement emerging, which is really about extending the realm of participation to the whole of life. We live in a representative democracy, which says you can vote every four years, and choose which people who exercise power on your behalf... now we're building tools and resources which say everybody needs to be involved, and everybody should have a voice (in other areas too, apart from just voting).\"\n\nPaola di Maio, another participant, narrated her experiences in deploying technology to cope with the fury of nature, as reflected in the December 26, 2004 Asian tsunami. She commented: \"Our emergency collaboration model emerged after we became familiar with the tsunami. I was in Thailand then. My internet was working but all the phone were down. So I got online via my tiny mobile, and was looking for information. We knew something big had happened, but there was simply no news emerging. One or two hours after the wave hit, there were headlines reporting an 'earthquake'.\"\n\nSacha of Indymedia in the US shared his group's experience with building alternatives from the grassroots. Currently, the Indymedia global network of participatory journalism has local units in 160 cities in 80 countries, and every continent. He said: \"Indymedia was created in 1999 to cover the WTO (World Trade Organisation) Ministerial and protests against it in Seattle. There were some 5000 activists taking part. Many strands from the Global Justice Movement joined in.\"\n\nLawrence Liang, a lawyer trained at the prestigious National Law School of India, had a session along with others on \"countering IP propaganda\". Ronaldo Lemos from Rio de Janeiro's Fundação Getúlio Vargas school of law referred to Yochai Benkler's book, \"The Wealth of Networks\". He also pointed to Jimmy Wales, who has said that in the foreseeable future there would be 12 fields that would become free. These things are: the encyclopedia, the dictionary, academic curriculum, music, art in general, file formats, maps, product identifiers, search engines, production made by communities, TV listings, academic publishing. Ronaldo Lemos felt that things lacking in this list included news and software.\n\nSaid Delhi-based independent writer and researcher Vijayalakshmi \"Viju\" Balakrishnan: \"In Asia, the history of (colonial) trade has largely been sea-based trade. And the language and philosophy now governing the way cyberspace is being controlled has strong parallels to what we saw in the seventeenth century. Free trade has functioned through pirate-based models. There were cartels or guild-power. For us in India it was the East India Company. For our friends in South East Asia, it was the VOC or the Dutch East India Company. Today, it is the Wintel (Windows-Intel) combo. In comparison to the state-control model of the past, we now have the story of how Google enters China.\"\n\nA number of other issues also emerged from the conference, which are aptly captured in the conference discussion list, wiki and multiple blogs.\n\nMembers of the Asia Commons advisory group are networked through this list. Those thanked for giving their \"valuable advice\" in shaping the Asia Commons conference includes (in a list which \"is not complete... and will continue to grow\") include Lawrence Liang of the Alternative Law Forum, iCommons director Paula Le Dieu, Creative Commons South Africa director Heather Ford, Open Society Foundation information programme manager Vera Franz, IDRC Pan Asia Networking team leader Laurent Elder, IDRC Pan Asia's Frank Tulus, International Open Source Network manager Sunil Abraham, and Association of Asian Confederation of Credit Union's Ranjith Hettiarachchi.\n\n"}
{"id": "47629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47629", "title": "Atil", "text": "Atil\n\nAtil (; cf. \"A-de Shui\"), literally meaning \"Big River\", was the capital of Khazaria from the middle of the 8th century until the end of the 10th century. The word is also a Turkic name for the Volga River.\n\nAtil was located along the Volga delta at the northwestern corner of the Caspian Sea. Following the defeat of the Khazars in the Second Arab-Khazar War, Atil became the capital of Khazaria. The city is referred to as Khamlij in 9th-century Arab sources, and the name Atil appears in the 10th century. At its height, the city was a major center of trade, and consisted of three parts separated by the Volga. The western part contained the administrative center of the city, with a court house and a large military garrison. The eastern part of the city was built later and acted as the commercial center of the Atil, and had many public baths and shops. Between them was an island on which stood the palaces of the Khazar Khagan and Bek. The island was connected to one of the other parts of the city by a pontoon bridge. According to Arab sources, one half of the city was referred to as Atil, while the other was named Khazaran.\n\nAtil was a multi-ethnic and religiously diverse city, inhabited by Jews, Christians, Muslims, Shamanists, and Pagans, many of them traders from foreign countries. All of the religious groups had their own places of worship in the city, and there were seven judges appointed to settle disputes (two Christian, two Jewish, and two Muslim judges, with a single judge for all of the Shamanists and other Pagans).\n\nSvyatoslav I of Kiev sacked Atil in 968 or 969 CE. Ibn Hawqal and al-Muqaddasi refer to Atil after 969, indicating that it may have been rebuilt. Al-Biruni (mid-11th century) reported that Atil was again in ruins, and did not mention the later city of Saqsin which was built nearby, so it is possible that this new Atil was only destroyed in the middle of the 11th century.\n\nThe archaeological remains of Atil have never been positively identified. It has been hypothesized that they were washed away by the rising level of the Caspian Sea. However, beginning in 2003 Dmitri Vasilyev of Astrakhan State University led a series of excavations at the Samosdelskoye site near the village of Samosdelka (Russian: Самосделка) in the Volga Delta. Vasilyev connected artifacts from the site with Khazar, Oghuz and Bulgar culture, leading him to believe that he had discovered the site of Saqsin. The matter is still unresolved. In 2006 Vasilyev announced his belief that the lowest stratum at the Samosdelka site was identical with the site of Atil. In 2008, this team of Russian archaeologists announced that they had discovered the ruins of Atil.\n\n\n"}

It stands at the western end of \"Brandenburger Straße\", which runs in a straight line up to the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul.\n\nPreviously, from 1733, there was another, simpler gate on the same spot, which resembled a castle gateway. Together with the city wall, a form of toll or excise barrier, and the other gates it was intended to prevent desertion and smuggling.\n\nTowards the end of the Seven Years' War, Frederick the Great had the old gate demolished and built, in its stead, this new Brandenburg Gate, as a symbol of his victory. For that reason the Brandenburg Gate resembles a Roman triumphal arch. Its prototype was the Arch of Constantine in Rome. The Roman influence of its architectural style can be seen, for example, in the double columns of Corinthian order as well as the design of the attic.\n\nA feature of the Brandenburg Gate is that it has two completely different sides, designed by two architects. Carl von Gontard designed the city side, his pupil, Georg Christian Unger, the field or countryside-facing side. Gontard made the city side as a rendered facade with Corinthian-style lesenes and trophies, Unger designed the field site in the style of the Arch of Constantine with Corinthian double-columns and ornamentation like the golden trumpets. The two side entrances for pedestrians were not added until 1843, under Frederick William IV, in order to cope with the increase in pedestrian traffic.\n\nAt that time people had to pass the Brandenburg Gate if they wanted to make their way to the town of Brandenburg, hence the name. The gate leads walkers into the city centre pedestrian zone of \"Brandenburger Straße\" in an easterly direction up to priory church of St. Peter and St. Paul.\n\nSince the city wall was demolished around 1900 the Brandenburg Gate has been a free-standing structure.\n\n"}

It was first published on October 2, 1841. While originally it published all acts of the Parliament of Canada, it later also published treaties, hearing and tribunals, proclamations and regulations, and various other official notices as required. At one time it contained information on bankruptcies. It has been administered by Public Works and Government Services Canada and the Queen's Printer since 1841. The \"Gazette\" is most often read to find new acts, regulations and proclamations.\n\nWhile not always widely read by the public, publication in the \"Gazette\" is considered official notice to all Canadians. After a regulation has been approved by the Privy Council Office and then the Cabinet of Canada, the regulation is published in the \"Gazette\". If a regulation has not been published in the \"Gazette\", a person cannot be convicted of the offence.\n\nCanada's provinces all have their own equivalents of the \"Gazette\".\n\nFrom inception in 1841 until 1998, the \"Gazette\" was published in print. From 1998 until 1 April 2014, it was published in print and online, with the online version having the same official status as the printed version starting in 2003. From 1 April 2014 onwards, it will only be published online to satisfy a Government of Canada requirement to make \"electronic publishing its new standard for all documents\". Structurally, the \"Gazette\" is published in three parts:\n\nPart I is published each Saturday. It contains public notices, official appointments and proposed regulations, as well as miscellaneous notices from the private sector that are required to be published by federal statute or by regulations. The proposed regulations are published in Part I as a way for the public to comment on them. Once the regulations are pre-published, the department that sponsored the legislation collects public comments to allow for any changes to be made to the regulation. Recently, Notices of Vacancies for senior positions in Government are published here too.\n\nPart II is published every second Wednesday and it contains all regulations that have been enacted as well as statutory instruments and other documents, such as orders in council, orders and proclamations. It has a consolidated index of regulations dating since January 1, 1955.\n\nPart III is published with the text of any new laws immediately after they have received Royal Assent and was first published in 1974. Starting from January 1998 all publications other than Part III are available in HTML and are not official. From April 1, 2003, the PDF version is an official version, as it is marked up from the same file as the printed version.

These include regulations that affect only a limited number of people, their publication would be contrary to national defense or international relations, or if their publication would violate personal privacy, such as notices of paroles and pardons.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "783719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=783719", "title": "Carn Brea, Redruth", "text": "Carn Brea, Redruth\n\nCarn Brea () is a civil parish and hilltop site in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The population of Carn Brea including Bosleake and Church Coombe was 8,013 at the 2011 census. The hilltop site is situated approximately one mile (1.6 km) southwest of Redruth. The settlements of Bosleake, Brea, Broad Lane, Carn Arthen, Carn Brea Village, Carnkie, Four Lanes, Grillis, Illogan Highway, Pencoys, Penhallick, Piece, Pool, Tolskithy, Tregajorran, Treskillard, Tuckingmill and West Tolgus are in the parish.\n\nThe Neolithic settlement at Carn Brea was a tor enclosure occupied between around 3700 and 3400 BC. Roger Mercer directed archaeological excavations of the site in 1970.\nand 1972.\n\nA two-acre (0.8 ha) inner enclosure was surrounded by one of eleven acres (4.5 ha). The ramparts consisted of stone walls with an earth bank and ditch. Traces of fourteen platforms on which would have stood Neolithic long houses have been found within its ramparts, along with pottery and flint artefacts.\n\nThe settlement had an estimated population of 100 to 150. There is evidence that the occupants cleared the surrounding land for farming by burning away the undergrowth and removing stones although the acid soil obliterated any environmental evidence. Nearby outcrops of rock suitable for making axes would have contributed to the village's economy. Edge grinding stones, blanks and incomplete and finished axes found on the site indicate the inhabitants were accomplished stoneworkers and traded their products. Pottery found on the site appears to have been made from gabbroic clay originating nearly 20 miles (30 km) to the south in the present day parish of St Keverne suggesting a complex economic network in the area.\n\nOver 700 flint arrowheads were found scattered at the site. Despite nineteenth-century destruction (work to level and widen the entrance track), there was a concentration of arrow heads around a probable entrance to the enclosure, Mercer's site E. These arrows may have been used by a large group of archers in an organized assault upon a defended site. Every timber structure on the site had been burnt, and charcoal was the only organic matter that survived the acid soils. The earthworks may have been deliberately damaged by invaders.\n\nIn the Iron Age the site was reoccupied and minerals were mined from the hillside. One hut floor was excavated, and sherds of characteristically Iron Age types, including 'cordoned ware', were found. The fortified gateway, Mercer's Site G, was of Iron Age form, and Mercer suggests that although Site G produced no Iron Age artifacts, it is post-Neolithic. The crushed-rock road surface showed little sign of contemporary wear and could never have been subjected to even a modicum of traffic.\n\nA hoard of Gallo-Belgic gold staters originating from northeastern Gaul and Kent were found in the 18th century.\n\nThe Ravenna Cosmography, of around AD 700, refers to Purocoronavis (almost certainly a corruption of Durocornovium), 'a fort or walled settlement of the Cornovii' (unidentified, but possibly Tintagel or Carn Brea).\n\nCarn Brea Castle stands near the top of the hill. It is built on the site of a chapel built in 1379 probably dedicated to St Michael. It was built in the 18th century by the Basset family as a hunting lodge. It is considered to be a folly built on the huge uncut boulders that make up part of its foundations, giving the impression of the building melting into the land. An East India trading ship named after Carn Brea Castle, was wrecked off the Isle of Wight in 1829 and involved in excise tax fraud.\n\nIn the 1980s the abandoned building was converted into a Middle Eastern cuisine restaurant. The stolen Ford Anglia featured in the \"Harry Potter\" films was found at the castle in 2006. \n\nAt the highest point of the hill is a 90-feet high (27m) Celtic cross erected as a monument to Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset (1757–1835). Basset, a mine owner, gained his titles for erecting earthworks to defend Plymouth from combined French and Spanish fleets in 1779, and suppressing a miners' \"food riot\" in 1785. Along with others, he petitioned the House of Lords against slavery in 1828. The monument was erected by public subscription in 1836. It is inscribed \"The County of Cornwall to the memory of Francis Lord de Dunstanville and Basset A.D. 1836.\" \n\nThe Cup and Saucer Rock next to the monument is a large flattish rock with several deep basins (see ). The rock has been called \"The Sacrificing Rock\" (although with doubtful historical accuracy). \n\n\nIn a depression between the monument and the castle are the remains of the \"Smugglers' Cave\". It was blocked with rocks by the council in the 1980s to stop children entering. The tunnel is rumoured to extend from the top of the carn into Redruth town, but it is probably an abandoned mine working. It may have been confused with another tunnel from the castle to St Uny's church which was blocked for safety reasons around 1970 by the castle owners. \n\nSaint Euny's Well is at the foot of Carn Brea below the castle near St Euny's Church. It has a plaque by Carn Brea Parish Trails reading \"St Euny Well. Holy well of St Euny visited by the Celtic Missionary 500AD\". Stories about its sacred use may be confused with St Euny's Well at Sancreed (see Carn Euny).\n\nAt Easter Redruth Baptist Church erects a lit cross on the outcrop behind the Castle overlooking Redruth. For many years a Christian sunrise service has been held on Easter Sunday.\n\nThe Midsummer Eve (St. John's Eve, 23 June) bonfire ceremony originated as a pagan ritual. Prayers are read in Cornish and the bonfire is lit, signalling other fires to be lit at Sennen, Sancreed Beacon, Carn Galver to the Tamar. When only the embers remain, young people leap across them to drive away evil and bring luck.\n\nThe Boxing Day meet of the Four Burrow Hunt starts at the top of Carn Brea. Due to the changes in fox hunting legislation foxes are no longer hunted.\n\n\n\n"}

When applied to items of cultural heritage, this activity is generally undertaken by a conservator-restorer.\n\nHistorically, objects made from copper or copper alloy were created for religious, artistic, technical, military, and domestic uses. The act of conservation and restoration strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. The prevention and removal of surface dirt and corrosion products are the primary concerns of conservator-restorers when dealing with copper or copper-alloy objects.\n\nCopper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world (including Pakistan, China, and the Americas) copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest his involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC. Previously the only tool made of copper had been the awl, used for punching holes in leather and gouging out peg-holes for wood joining. However, the introduction of a more robust form of copper led to the widespread use, and large-scale production of heavy metal tools, including axes, adzes, and axe-adzes.\n\nAlloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting, and about 2000 years after \"natural bronze\" had come into general use. Bronze artifacts from Sumerian cities and Egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC. The Bronze Age began in Southeastern Europe around 3700 - 3300 BC, in Northwestern Europe about 2500 BC. It ended with the beginning of the Iron Age, 2000-1000 BC in the Near East, 600 BC in Northern Europe. The transition between the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the Chalcolithic period (copper-stone), with copper tools being used with stone tools. This term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the Calcholithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is of much more recent origin. It was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire.\n\nIn Greece, copper was known by the name \"chalkos\" (χαλκός). It was an important resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as \"aes Cyprium\", \"aes\" being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and \"Cyprium\" from Cyprus, where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to \"cuprum\", hence the English \"copper\". Aphrodite and Venus represented copper in mythology and alchemy, because of its lustrous beauty, its ancient use in producing mirrors, and its association with Cyprus, which was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper.\n\nBritain's first use of brass occurred around the 3rd–2nd century BC. In North America, copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans. Native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD; it proceeded at a much slower rate on other continents. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.\n\nThe cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important. Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass, while Octavianus Augustus Caesar's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000 t, Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the Industrial Revolution; the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania, Cyprus and in Central Europe.\n\nThe gates of the Temple of Jerusalem used Corinthian bronze made by depletion gilding. It was most prevalent in Alexandria, where alchemy is thought to have begun. In ancient India, copper was used in the holistic medical science Ayurveda for surgical instruments and other medical equipment. Ancient Egyptians (~2400 BC) used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water, and later on for headaches, burns, and itching. The Baghdad Battery, with copper cylinders soldered to lead, dates back to 248 BC to AD 226 and resembles a galvanic cell, leading people to believe this was the first battery; the claim has not been verified.\n\nThe Great Copper Mountain was a mine in Falun, Sweden, that operated from the 10th century to 1992. It produced two thirds of Europe's copper demand in the 17th century and helped fund many of Sweden's wars during that time. It was referred to as the nation's treasury; Sweden had a copper backed currency.\n\nThe uses of copper in art were not limited to currency: it was used by Renaissance sculptors, in photographic technology known as the daguerreotype, and the Statue of Liberty. Copper plating and copper sheathing for ships' hulls was widespread; the ships of Christopher Columbus were among the earliest to have this feature. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones. Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world’s primary copper production.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries, formed in 1967 with Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, played a similar role for copper as OPEC does for oil. It never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, was never a member; it was dissolved in 1988.\n\nSystematic and well-managed documentation is today an essential prerequisite for quality executed conservation and restoration treatments, including documentation of the state of objects before, during and after treatment. Identification of materials and procedures used to produce object and the results of any scientific research must be part of documentation too. Last but not least, an integral part of the documentation must be a recommendation for further care of object.\n\n\nIn preparing the strategy of the metals conservation project interdisciplinary approach to the same is essential.It implies the participation of as many experts as is possible, as a minimum, we can take curator (archaeologist, historian, art historian), scientists specialized for corrosion of metallic objects of cultural heritage and the conservator - restorer\n\n\n\n-Microsandblasting\n\n-Dry ice blasting\n\n-Scalpel or scraper\n\nHigh speed micromotor\n\n-Steel or ceramic burs and cutters\n\n-Abrasive wheels\n\n-Wire brushes\n\n-Glass fibre brushes and pens\n\n-Setting hammer\n\n-benzotriazole.\n\n-4 methyl imidazole\n\n-tannin\n\n-ammonium sulphide\n\n\nThe items should be stored in rooms that are protected from polluted air, dust, ultraviolet radiation, and excessive relative humidity - ideal values are temperature of 16-20 °C and up to 40%(35-55% according to recent Canadian Conservation Institute recommendations) relative humidity, noting that if metal is combined with organic materials, relative humidity should not be below 45%. Archaeological objects must be stored in rooms (or plastic boxes)with very low relative humidity, or in the case of particularly valuable items in the chambers with nitrogen or argon. Copper or copper alloy objects with active corrosion up to 35% RH. Shelves in the storerooms must be of stainless steel or chlorine and acetate free plastic or powder coated steel. Wood and wood based products(Particle board, plywood) must be avoided. Also do not use rubber, felt or wool .When you are handling metal objects,always wear clean cotton gloves . Lighting levels must be kept below 300 lux (up to 150 lux in case of lacquered or painted objects,up to 50 lux in case of objects with light sensitive materials).\n\n\n\n\nStudies in the Field of Fine Arts. 9:21-24. \n\n\nНекоторые методы химической очистки бронзы,Сообщения ВЦНИЛКР. № 13. - Moscow. 1964.(online)\n\nО возможности применения гексамета-фосфата натрия и трилона «Б» для очистки археологических бронзовых предметов от продуктов коррозии (Практическая проверка) ,Сообщения ВЦНИЛКР. № 13. - Moscow. 1964.(online)\n\nУльтразвуковая очистка музейных объектов из металла,Сообщения ВЦНИЛКР. № 13. - Moscow. 1964.(online)\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrosion 41 (1985) 100-104.\n\n\n(1987) 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1989.

{"id": "3120054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3120054", "title": "Copyist", "text": "Copyist\n\nA copyist is a person who makes copies. \nThe term is sometimes used for artists who make copies of other artists' paintings. However, the modern use of the term is almost entirely confined to music copyists, who are employed by the music industry to produce neat copies from a composer or arranger's manuscript.\n\nUntil the 1990s, most copyists worked by hand to write out scores and individual instrumental parts neatly, using a calligraphy pen, manuscript paper, and often a ruler. Producing parts for an entire orchestra from a full score was a huge task. In the 1990s, copyists began using scorewriters - computer programs which are the music notation equivalent of a word processor. (Such programs include \"Sibelius\", \"Finale\", \"MuseScore\" or \"GNU LilyPond\"). Scorewriters allow the composer or songwriter to \"enter\" the melodies, rhythms and lyrics to their compositions into the computer using a mouse or by playing the notes on a MIDI-equipped keyboard. Once a composition is fully entered into a scorewriting program, the computer can be instructed to print out the parts for all of the different instruments.\n\nBoth handwritten and computer-based copying require significant understanding of musical notation, music theory, the musical styles and conventions of different styles of music (e.g., regarding appropriate ornamentation, harmony rules pertaining to accidentals, etc.), and strong attention to detail and past conventions. Ludwig van Beethoven had a contentious relationship with his copyists, who often made mistakes that remained uncorrected until the advent of Urtext editions; some musicologists have devoted a lot of effort to identifying Beethoven's copyists.\n\n"}
{"id": "3007483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3007483", "title": "Dragoman", "text": "Dragoman\n\nA dragoman was an interpreter, translator, and official guide between Turkish, Arabic, and Persian-speaking countries and polities of the Middle East and European embassies, consulates, vice-consulates and trading posts. A dragoman had to have a knowledge of Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and European languages.\n\nThe position took particular prominence in the Ottoman Empire, where demand for the mediation provided by dragomans is said to have been created by the resistance on the part of the Muslim Ottomans to learn the languages of non-Muslim nations. The office incorporated diplomatic as well as linguistic duties—namely, in the Porte's relation with Christian countries—and some dragomans thus came to play crucial roles in Ottoman politics. The profession tended to be dominated by ethnic Greeks, including the first Ottoman Dragoman of the Sublime Porte, Panagiotis Nikousios, the official interpreter for the \"Divan\" (Imperial Council) of the Sultan, and his successor Alexander Mavrocordatos. But this dominance changed in 1821 with the start of the Greek War of Independence. In 1821 the chief dragoman Constantine Mourouzi was executed for suspected disloyalty, and his successor, Stavraki Aristarchi, was dismissed and exiled in 1822. With unanswered correspondence accumulating, the chief naval instructor, one Ishak Efendi, took over the position and became a pioneer in translation of Western scientific literature into Turkish, a task for which he had to create an entirely new vocabulary. Following Ishak, the grand dragoman and his staff were Muslims, and the Translation Office (\"Tercüme Odası\", \"Translation Room\", in Turkish), with its familiarity with things European, became a new major ladder to influence and power in the Tanzimat era; this knowledge largely replaced the older ladders of the army, the bureaucracy, and the religious establishment in the mid- and late-19th century.\n\nIt became customary that most hospodars of the Phanariote rule (roughly 1711–1821) over the Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia) would previously have occupied this Ottoman office, a fact which did not prevent many of them from joining conspiracies that aimed to overthrow Turkish rule over the area.\nIn Arabic the word is ترجمان (\"tarjumān\"), in Turkish \"tercüman\". Deriving from the Semitic quadriliteral root \"t-r-g-m\", it appears in Akkadian as \"targumannu,\" in Ge'ez (Classical Ethiopic) as \"t-r-gw-m\", and in Aramaic as \"targemana\". Hebrew makes a distinction between מתרגם (\"metargem\")—referring to a translator of written texts—and מתורגמן (\"meturgeman\") referring to an interpreter of spoken conversation or speeches. The latter is obviously more closely related to the other languages mentioned, though both are derived from the same Semitic root. There has been speculation of a Hittite origin of the term (Salonen, p. 12; Rabin, pp. 134–136).\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the word entered European languages: in Middle English as \"dragman\", from Old French \"drugeman\", from Medieval Latin as \"dragumannus\", from Middle Greek δραγομάνος, \"dragoumanos\". Later European variants include the German \"trutzelmann\", the French \"trucheman\" or \"truchement\" (in modern French it is \"drogman\"), the Italian \"turcimanno\", and the Spanish \"trujamán\", \"trujimán\" and \"truchimán\"; these variants point to a Turkish or Arabic word \"turjuman\", with different vocalization. \"Webster's Dictionary\" of 1828 lists \"dragoman\" as well as the variants \"drogman\" and \"truchman\" in English.\n\nConsequently, the plural, in English, is \"dragomans\" (not \"dragomen\").\n\nThe family name of Franjo Tudjman, the first post-Communist President of Croatia, indicates that one of his ancestors might have been a dragoman.\n\nIn the Turkish tradition, the dragoman position is recorded in the pre-Ottoman Sultanate of Rum during the 13th-century reign of Keykubad I when two dragomans and two translator clerks were appointed.\n\nIn Ottoman records, the first imperial dragoman recorded was Lutfi Bey or Lutfi Pasha who was sent to Venice in 1479 to deliver a treaty.\n\nThese men were instrumental in spreading a wide-ranging curiosity about Islamic culture throughout the Latin parts of Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. The dragomans had scholarly language training in Persian, Arabic and Turkish since they were translators, interpreters, authors and were very open to the material and fashionable intricacies of the Ottoman culture.\n\nThe first French translation of the Quran was done by André du Ryer, in 1647. He was from the French consulate in Egypt. Another, Cosmo of Carbognano, from the Naples embassy, published in Latin: \"The Principles of Turkish Grammar for The Use of Apostolic Missionaries in Constantinople\" (Rome 1794). \n\nAs a highly trained group of diplomatic professionals, they were employed by embassies, consuls and travelled in diplomatic circles, hence their need to know the culture very well. \n\nThere was huge success from the published translation of \"Thousand And One Nights\", by Antoine Galland (1646-1715). He was attached to the embassy of Charles Marie François Olier, marquis de Nointel, a Parisian who was a councilor to the Parlement de Paris, and a French ambassador to the Ottoman court, 1670 to 1679.\n\nOne who created a large European interest in the history of Islam, with his published \"History of the Ottoman Empire\" was Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall of Austria, a student at the Diplomatic Academy of Vienna (the academy was initially established by Empress Maria Theresa in 1754 as \"The Oriental Academy\" to train young diplomats to represent the Habsburg Empire abroad).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11075736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11075736", "title": "Duquesne Spy Ring", "text": "Duquesne Spy Ring\n\nThe Duquesne Spy Ring is the largest espionage case in United States history that ended in convictions. A total of 33 members of a German espionage network headed by Frederick \"Fritz\" Joubert Duquesne were convicted after a lengthy investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Of those indicted, 19 pleaded guilty. The remaining 14 were brought to jury trial in Federal District Court, Brooklyn, New York, on September 3, 1941; all were found guilty on December 13, 1941. On January 2, 1942, the group was sentenced to serve a total of over 300 years in prison.\n\nThe agents who formed the Duquesne Ring were placed in key jobs in the United States to get information that could be used in the event of war and to carry out acts of sabotage: one opened a restaurant and used his position to get information from his customers; another worked on an airline so that he could report Allied ships that were crossing the Atlantic Ocean; others worked as delivery people as a cover for carrying secret messages.\n\nWilliam G. Sebold, who had been blackmailed into becoming a spy for Germany, became a double agent and helped the FBI gather evidence. For nearly two years, the FBI ran a shortwave radio station in New York for the ring. They learned what information Germany was sending its spies in the United States and controlled what was sent to Germany. Sebold's success as a counterespionage agent was demonstrated by the successful prosecution of the German agents.\n\nOne German spymaster later commented the ring's roundup delivered \"the death blow\" to their espionage efforts in the United States. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover called his concerted FBI swoop on Duquesne's ring the greatest spy roundup in U.S. history.\n\nThe 1945 film \"The House on 92nd Street\" was a thinly disguised version of the \"Duquesne Spy Ring\" saga of 1941.\n\nAfter the Duquesne Spy Ring convictions, Sebold was provided with a new identity and started a chicken farm in California.\n\nImpoverished and delusional, he was committed to Napa State Hospital in 1965. Diagnosed with manic-depression, he died there of a heart attack five years later at 70. His life story as a double agent was first told in the 1943 book \"Passport to Treason: The Inside Story of Spies in America\" by Alan Hynd.\n\nSpecial Agent Jim Ellsworth was assigned as Sebold's handler or body man, responsible for shadowing his every move during the sixteen-month investigation.\n\nWilliam Gustav Friedemann was a principal witness in the Duquesne case. He began working for the FBI as a fingerprint analyst in 1935 and later became an agent after identifying a crucial fingerprint in a kidnapping case.\n\nAfter World War II, he was assigned to Puerto Rico, where he pinpointed the group behind the assassination attempt on President Harry Truman. Friedemann died of cancer on August 23, 1989 in Stillwater, Oklahoma.\n\nBorn in Cape Colony, South Africa, on September 21, 1877, and naturalized a citizen of the United States in 1913, Fritz Joubert Duquesne was a Captain in the Second Boer War and later a Colonel in the Abwehr, Germany’s division of military intelligence.\n\nDuquesne was captured and imprisoned three times by the British, once by the Portuguese, and once by the Americans in 1917, and each time he escaped. In World War I, he was a spy and ring leader for Germany and during this time he sabotaged British merchant ships in South America with concealed bombs and destroyed several. Duquesne was also ordered to assassinate an American, Frederick Russell Burnham, Chief of Scouts for the British Army, but failed to do so. He was also known as \"The man who killed Kitchener\" since he claimed to have sabotaged and sunk HMS \"Hampshire\", on which Lord Kitchener was en route to Russia in 1916.\n\nIn the spring of 1934, Duquesne became an intelligence officer for the Order of 76, an American pro-Nazi organization, and in January 1935 he began working for U.S. government’s Works Progress Administration. Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of the Abwehr, knew Duquesne from his work in World War I and he instructed his new chief of operations in the U.S., Col. Nikolaus Ritter, to make contact. Ritter had been friends with Duquesne back in 1931 and the two spies reconnected in New York on December 3, 1937.\n\nOn February 8, 1940, Ritter sent Sebold, under the alias of Harry Sawyer, to New York and instructed him to set up a shortwave radio-transmitting station and to contact Duquesne, code-named DUNN. \n\nOnce the FBI discovered through Selbold that Duquesne was again in New York operating as a German spy, director J. Edgar Hoover provided a background briefing to President Franklin Roosevelt. FBI agent Raymond Newkirk, using the name Ray McManus, was now assigned to DUNN and he rented a room immediately above Duquesne's apartment near Central Park and used a hidden microphone to record Duquesne's conversations. But monitoring Duquesne's activities proved to be difficult. As Newkirk described it, \"The Duke had been a spy all of his life and automatically used all of the tricks in the book to avoid anyone following him ... He would take a local train, change to an express, change back to a local, go through a revolving door and keep going on right around, take an elevator up a floor, get off, walk back to the ground, and take off in a different entrance of the building.\" Duquesne also informed Sebold that he was certain he was under surveillance, and he even confronted one FBI agent and demanded that he stop tracking him, a story confirmed by agent Newkirk.\n\nIn a letter to the \"Chemical Warfare Service\" in Washington, D.C., Duquesne requested information on a new gas mask. He identified himself as a \"well-known, responsible and reputable writer and lecturer\". At the bottom of the letter, he wrote, \"Don't be concerned if this information is confidential, because it will be in the hands of a good, patriotic citizen.\" A short time later, the information he requested arrived in the mail and a week later it was being read by intelligence officers in Berlin.\n\nHe served his sentence in Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary in Kansas, where he was mistreated and beaten by other inmates. In 1954, he was released due to ill health, having served 14 years, and died indigent, at City Hospital on Welfare Island (now Roosevelt Island), New York City on May 24, 1956, at the age of 78.\n\nBlank boasted to agent Sebold that he had been in the espionage business since 1936, but that he had lost interest in recent years because payments from Germany had fallen off.\n\nBlank pleaded guilty to violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. He received a sentence of 18 months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine.\n\nAround 1938, Heine was recruited to find American automobile and aviation industry secrets that could be passed to Germany through the Duquesne Spy Ring.\n\nLater it was discovered that Heine was also the mysterious \"Heinrich\" who supplied the spy ring with aerial photographs.\n\nAfter obtaining technical books relating to magnesium and aluminum alloys, Heine sent the materials to Heinrich Eilers. To ensure safe delivery of the books to Germany in case they did not reach Eilers, Heine indicated the return address on the package as the address of Lilly Stein.\n\nUpon conviction of violating the Registration Act, Heine received a $5,000 fine and a 2-year prison sentence\n\nHerman W. Lang had participated with Adolf Hitler in the Munich beer hall putsch of 1923. \n\nUntil his arrest, Lang had been employed by the Carl L. Norden Corp., which manufactured the top secret Norden bombsight. Ritter then hid the plans in the wooden casing for an umbrella, and, on January 9, 1938, personally handed the umbrella off to a German steward and secret courier on the ship \"Reliance\" bound for Bremen.\n\nThe Norden bombsight had been considered a critical wartime instrument by the United States Army Air Forces, and American bombardiers were required to take an oath during their training stating that they would defend its secret with their own life, if needed. It is perhaps because of Lang that the bombsight instruments used by Luftwaffe bombers during the war were fairly similar to the United States' Norden bombsight.\n\nThe Lotfernrohr 3 and the BZG 2 in 1942 used a similar set of gyroscopes that provided a stabilized platform for the bombardier to sight through, although the more complex interaction between the bombsight and autopilot was not used. Later in the war, Luftwaffe bombers used the Carl Zeiss Lotfernrohr 7, or Lotfe 7, which had an advanced mechanical system similar to the Norden bombsight, but was much simpler to operate and maintain. At one point, Sebold was ordered to contact Lang as it became known that the technology he had stolen from Norden was being used in German bombers. The Nazis offered to spirit him to safety in Germany, but Lang refused to leave his home in Ridgewood, Queens.\n\nUpon conviction, Lang received a sentence of 18 years in prison on espionage charges and a two-year concurrent sentence under the Registration Act. Lang was deported to Germany in September 1950.\n\nA native of Arkansas, Evelyn Clayton Lewis had been living with Duquesne in New York City. Lewis had expressed her anti-British and anti-Semitic feelings during her relationship with Duquesne. She was aware of his espionage activities and condoned them. While she was not active in obtaining information for Germany, she helped Duquesne prepare material for transmittal abroad. Upon a guilty plea, Lewis was sentenced to serve one year and one day in prison for violation of the Registration Act.\n\nRene Emanuel Mezenen, a Frenchman, claimed U.S. citizenship through the naturalization of his father. Prior to his arrest, he was employed as a steward in the Pan American transatlantic clipper service.\n\nThe German Intelligence Service in Lisbon, Portugal, asked Mezenen to act as a courier, transmitting information between the United States and Portugal on his regular commercial aircraft trips. As a steward he was able to deliver documents from New York to Lisbon in 24 hours. He accepted this offer for financial gain. In the course of flights across the Atlantic, Mezenen reported his observance of convoys sailing for England. He also became involved in smuggling platinum from the United States to Portugal. When discussing his courier role with agent Sebold, Mezenen boasted that he hid the spy letters so well that if they were found it would have taken two to three weeks to repair the airplane.\n\nFollowing a plea of guilty, Mezenen received an eight-year prison term for espionage and two concurrent years for registration violations.\n\nHaving come to the United States from Germany in 1929, Carl Reuper became a citizen in 1936. Prior to his arrest, he served as an inspector for the Westinghouse Electric Company in Newark, New Jersey. Previously, he worked as a mechanic for the Air Associates Company in Bendix, New Jersey.\n\nReuper obtained photographs for Germany relating to national defense materials and construction, which he obtained from his employment. He arranged radio contact with Germany through the station established by Felix Jahnke. On one occasion, he conferred with Sebold regarding the latter's facilities for communicating with German authorities. Upon conviction, Reuper was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment on espionage charges and 2 years' concurrent sentence under the Registration Act.\n\nBorn in the Bronx, New York, Everett Minster Roeder was the son of a celebrated piano instructor, Carl Roeder. A child prodigy, when he was 15 years old he enrolled in engineering at Cornell University and there he met the brothers Edward and Elmer Sperry; however he dropped out of school when he was 18 and married his pregnant girlfriend. He was one of the first employees at the Sperry Gyroscope Company where he worked as an engineer and designer of confidential materials for the U.S. Army and Navy. In his job as a gyroscope expert working on U.S. military contracts, Roeder built machines such as tracking devices for long range guns capable of hitting moving targets 10 miles away, aircraft autopilot and blind-flying systems, ship stabilizers, and anti-aircraft search lights.\n\nSebold had delivered microphotograph instructions to Roeder, as ordered by German authorities. Roeder and Sebold met in public places and proceeded to spots where they could talk privately. In 1936, Roeder had visited Germany and was requested by German authorities to act as an espionage agent. Primarily due to monetary rewards he would receive, Roeder agreed.\n\nAmong the Sperry development secrets Roeder disclosed were the blueprints of the complete radio instrumentation of the new Glenn Martin bomber, classified drawings of range finders, blind-flying instruments, a bank-and-turn indicator, a navigator compass, a wiring diagram of the Lockheed Hudson bomber, and diagrams of the Hudson gun mountings. From Roeder the Abwehr also obtained the plans for an advanced automatic pilot device that was later used in Luftwaffe fighters and bombers.* At the time of his arrest, Roeder had 16 guns in his Long Island home in New York.\n\nRoeder entered a guilty plea to the charge of espionage and was sentenced to 16 years in prison. In 1949, Roeder published his book, \"Formulas in plane triangles\".\n\nA German native, Paul Scholz went to the United States in 1926 but never attained citizenship. He had been employed in German book stores in New York City, where he disseminated Nazi propaganda.\n\nScholz had arranged for Josef Klein to construct the radio set used by Felix Jahnke and Axel Wheeler-Hill. At the time of his arrest, Scholz had just given Gustav Wilhelm Kaercher a list of radio call letters and frequencies. He also encouraged members of this spy ring to secure data for Germany and arranged contacts between various German agents.\n\nUpon conviction, Scholz was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment for espionage with 2 years' concurrent sentence under the Registration Act.\n\nGeorge Gottlob Schuh, a native of Germany, went to the United States in 1923. He became a citizen in 1939 and was employed as a carpenter.\n\nAs a German agent, he sent information directly to the Gestapo in Hamburg from the United States. Schuh had provided Alfred Brokhoff information that Winston Churchill had arrived in the United States on the HMS \"King George V\". He also furnished information to Germany concerning the movement of ships carrying materials and supplies to Britain.\n\nHaving pleaded guilty to violation of the Registration Act, Schuh received a sentence of 18 months in prison and a $1,000 fine.\n\nErwin Wilhelm Siegler went to the United States from Germany in 1929 and attained citizenship in 1936. He had served as chief butcher on the SS \"America\" until it was taken over by the U.S. Navy.\n\nA courier, Siegler brought microphotographic instructions to Sebold from German authorities on one occasion. He also had brought $2,900 from German contacts abroad to pay Lilly Stein, Duquesne, and Roeder for their services and to buy a bomb sight. He served the espionage group as an organizer and contact man, and he also obtained information about the movement of ships and military defense preparations at the Panama Canal.\n\nSubsequent to his conviction, Siegler was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on espionage charges and a concurrent 2-year term for violation of the Registration Act.\n\nBorn in Germany, Oscar Richard Stabler went to the United States in 1923 and became a citizen in 1933. He had been employed primarily as a barber aboard transoceanic ships.\n\nIn December 1940, British authorities in Bermuda found a map of Gibraltar in his possession. He was detained for a short period before being released. A close associate of Conradin Otto Dold, Stabler served as a courier, transmitting information between German agents in the United States and contacts abroad.\n\nStabler was convicted and sentenced to serve five years in prison for espionage and a two-year concurrent term under the Registration Act.\n\nHeinrich Stade went to the United States from Germany in 1922 and became a citizen in 1929. He had been a musician and publicity agent in New York. He told agent Sebold he had been in the German Gestapo since 1936 and boasted that he knew everything in the spy business.\n\nStade had arranged for Paul Bante's contact with Sebold and had transmitted data to Germany regarding points of rendezvous for convoys carrying supplies to England.\n\nStade was arrested while playing in the orchestra at an inn on Long Island, New York. Following a guilty plea to violation of the Registration Act, Stade was fined $1,000 and received a 15-month prison sentence.\n\nBorn in Vienna, Stein was a Jewish immigrant who had escaped in 1939 with the help of a U.S. diplomat in Vienna, Vice Consul Ogden Hammond Jr. She later met Hugo Sebold, the espionage instructor who had trained William Sebold (the two men were not related) in Hamburg, Germany. She enrolled in this school and was sent to the United States by way of Sweden in 1939.\n\nIn New York, she worked as an artist's model and was said to have moved in New York's social circles. As a German agent her mission was to find her targets at New York nightclubs, sleep with these men, and attempt to blackmail them or otherwise entice them to give up valuable secrets. One FBI agent described her as a \"good-looking nymphomaniac\". Stein was one of the people to whom Sebold had been instructed to deliver microphotograph instructions upon his arrival in the United States. She frequently met with Sebold to give him information for transmittal to Germany, and her address was used as a return address by other agents in mailing data for Germany.\n\nStein pleaded guilty and received sentences of 10 years' and 2 concurrent years' imprisonment for violations of espionage and registration statutes, respectively. She served 12 years and left for France where she found employment at a luxury resort near Strasbourg.\n\nIn 1931, Franz Joseph Stigler, left Germany for the United States, where he became a citizen in 1939. He had been employed as a crew member and chief baker aboard U.S. ships until his discharge from the when the U.S. Navy converted that ship into . His constant companion was Erwin Siegler, and they operated as couriers in transmitting information between the United States and German agents aboard. Stigler sought to recruit amateur radio operators in the United States as channels of communication to German radio stations. He had also observed and reported defense preparations in the Panama Canal Zone and had met with other German agents to advise them in their espionage pursuits. In January 1941, Stigler asked agent Sebold to radio Germany that Prime Minister Winston Churchill had arrived secretly in the U.S. on the H.M.S. \"King George V\" with Lord Halifax.\n\nUpon conviction, Stigler was sentenced to serve 16 years in prison on espionage charges with 2 concurrent years for registration violations.\n\nA seaman aboard the ships of the United States Lines since his arrival in the United States, Erich Strunck went to the United States from Germany in 1927. He became a naturalized citizen in 1935. As a courier, Strunck carried messages between German agents in the United States and Europe. He requested authority to steal the diplomatic bag of a British officer traveling aboard his ship and to dispose of the officer by pushing him overboard. Sebold convinced him that it would be too risky to do so.\n\nStrunck was convicted and sentenced to serve 10 years in prison on espionage charges. He also was sentenced to serve a two-year concurrent term under the Registration Act.\n\nLeo Waalen was born in Danzig, Germany. He entered the United States by \"jumping ship\" about 1935. He was a painter for a small boat company which was constructing small craft for the U.S. Navy.\n\nWaalen gathered information about ships sailing for England. He also obtained a confidential booklet issued by the FBI which contained precautions to be taken by industrial plants to safeguard national defense materials from sabotage. He secured government contracts listing specifications for materials and equipment, as well as detailed sea charts of the United States Atlantic coastline.\n\nIn May 1941, the SS \"Robin Moor\" was carrying nine officers, 29 crewmen, seven or eight passengers, and a commercial cargo from New York to Mozambique via South Africa, without a protective convoy. On 21 May, the ship was stopped by \"U-69\" in the tropical Atlantic 750 miles west of the British-controlled port of Freetown, Sierra Leone.\n\nAlthough the SS \"Robin Moor\" was flying the flag of a neutral country, her mate was told by the U-boat crew that they had decided to \"let us have it.\" After a brief period for the ship's crew and passengers to board her four lifeboats, the U-boat fired a torpedo and then shelled the vacated ship.\n\nOnce the ship sank beneath the waves, the submarine's crew pulled up to Captain W.E. Myers' lifeboat, left him with four tins of ersatz bread and two tins of butter, and explained that the ship had been sunk because she was carrying supplies to Germany's enemy. \n\nIn October 1941, federal prosecutors adduced testimony that Waalen, one of the fourteen accused men who had pleaded not guilty to all charges, had submitted the sailing date of the SS \"Robin Moor\" for radio transmission to Germany, five days before the ship began her final voyage.\n\nFollowing his conviction, Waalen was sentenced to 12 years in prison for espionage and a concurrent 2-year term for violation of the Registration Act.\n\nA German native, Walischewski had been a seaman since maturity. He became a naturalized citizen in 1935. Walischewski became connected with the German espionage system through Paul Fehse. His duties were confined to those of courier, carrying data from agents in the United States to contacts abroad.\n\nUpon conviction, Walischewski received a five-year prison sentence on espionage charges, as well as a two-year concurrent sentence under the Registration Act.\n\nElse Weustenfeld arrived in the United States from Germany in 1927 and became a citizen 10 years later. From 1935 until her arrest, she was a secretary for a law firm representing the German Consulate in New York City.\n\nWeustenfeld was thoroughly acquainted with the German espionage system and delivered funds to Duquesne which she had received from Lilly Stein, her close friend.\n\nShe lived in New York City with Hans W. Ritter, a principal in the German espionage system. His brother, Nickolaus Ritter, was the \"Dr. Renken\" who had enlisted Sebold as a German agent. In 1940, Weustenfeld visited Hans Ritter in Mexico, where he was serving as a paymaster for the German Intelligence Service.\n\nAfter pleading guilty, Else Weustenfeld was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on charge of espionage and two concurrent years on a charge of registration violations.\n\nAxel Wheeler-Hill went to the United States in 1923 from his native Russia. He was naturalized as a citizen in 1929 and was employed as a truck driver.\n\nWheeler-Hill obtained information for Germany regarding ships sailing to Britain from New York Harbor. With Felix Jahnke, he enlisted the aid of Paul Scholz in building a radio set for sending coded messages to Germany.\n\nFollowing conviction, Wheeler-Hill was sentenced to serve 15 years in prison for espionage and 2 concurrent years under the Registration Act.\n\nBorn in Germany, Bertram Wolfgang Zenzinger went to the United States in 1940 as a naturalized citizen of the Union of South Africa. His reported reason for coming to the United States was to study mechanical dentistry in Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn July 1940, Zenzinger received a pencil for preparing invisible messages for Germany in the mail from Siegler. He sent several letters to Germany through a mail drop in Sweden, outlining details of national defense materials.\n\nZenzinger was arrested by FBI agents on April 16, 1941. Pleading guilty, he received 18 months in prison for violation of the Registration Act and 8 years' imprisonment for espionage.\n\nLieut Commander Takeo Ezima of the Imperial Japanese Navy operated in New York as an engineer inspector using the name: E. Satoz; code name: KATO.\n\nHe arrived on the Heian Maur in Seattle in 1938. On October 19, 1940, Sebold received a radio message from Germany that CARR (Abwehr Agent Roeder) was to meet E. Satoz at a Japanese club in New York.\n\nEzima was filmed by the FBI while meeting with agent Sebold in New York, conclusive evidence of German-Japanese cooperation in espionage, in addition to meeting with Kanegoro Koike, Paymaster Commander of the Japanese Imperial Navy assigned to the Office of the Japanese Naval Inspector in New York. Ezima obtained a number of military materials from Duquesne, including ammunition, a drawing of a hydraulic unit with pressure switch A-5 of the Sperry Gyroscope, and an original drawing from the Lawrence Engineering and Research Corporation of a soundproofing installation, and he agreed to deliver materials to Germany via Japan. The British had made the Abwehr courier route from New York through Lisbon, Portugal difficult, so Ezima arranged an alternate route to the West Coast with deliveries every two weeks on freighters destined for Japan.\n\nAs the FBI arrested Duquesne and his agents in New York in 1941, Ezima escaped to the West Coast, boarded the Japanese freighter Kamakura Maru, and left for Tokyo. One historian states that Ezima was arrested for espionage in 1942 and sentenced to 15 years; however, U.S Naval Intelligence documents state that \"at the request [of] the State Department, Ezima was not prosecuted.\"\n\nOberstleutnant (Lieutenant colonel) Nikolaus Ritter led spy rings in the United States, Great Britain, and North Africa from 1936 to 1941. Ritter was born in Germany and had served as an officer in the First World War on the Western Front in France where he was twice wounded. He emigrated to New York in 1924, married an American, and returned to Germany in 1936 to join the Abwehr as Chief of Air Intelligence based in Hamburg operating under the code name: DR. RANTZAU.\n\nHe first met Fritz Duquesne in 1931, and the two spies reconnected in New York on December 3, 1937. Ritter also met Herman Lang while in New York, and he arranged for Lang to later go to Germany help the Nazis finish their version of the topsecret Norden bombsight. Ritter achieved several major successes with the Abwehr, most notably the Norden bombsight, in addition to an advanced aircraft auto-pilot from the Sperry Gyroscope Company, and also intelligence operations in North Africa in support of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. But some of Ritter's recruits became double-agents who catastrophically exposed his spy rings.\n\nRitter recruited William Sebold who later joined the FBI which resulted in the arrest of the 33 Abwehr agents of the Duquesne Spy Ring. In Great Britain, he recruited Arthur Owens, code named JOHNNY, who became an agent for MI5 (British Intelligence) operating under the code name SNOW. Owens exposed so many Abwehr covert agents operating in Britain that by the end of the war MI5 had enlisted some 120 double agents. Although Ritter was never captured, it was the arrest of the Duquesne Spy Ring that ultimately resulted in Ritter's fall from the Abwehr and his reassignment in 1942 to air defenses in Germany for the remainder of the Second World War.\n\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n"}

According to Bertrand Russell's theory of truth, there is only one actual world, and a statement's truth value depends on whether the statement obtains in the actual world. Continuing the tradition of Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell posited that a name picks out, or refers to, a real object in the world (Russell's correspondence theory of truth). The name \"Genghis Khan\" thus picks out the 12th and 13th century Mongol leader we know by that name. Any sentence in which we attach a predicate to the name \"Genghis Khan\" is true if the predicate obtained in the actual world. Any sentence in which the predicate does not obtain for Genghis Khan is false. The Wikipedia statement “\"Genghis Khan founded the largest contiguous empire in world history\"” is thus true, and the statement “\"Genghis Khan was one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London\"” is false. As an example for a name that fails to refer to a real object, Russell used “\"the present king of France\"“ in a 1905 article. \n\nAccording to the Russellian theory of reference, the statement “Long John Silver has a wooden leg” and the statement “Earth's moon has a diameter of 2856 kilometers” are both false. The first statement suffers reference failure, because it fails to pick out an individual in the actual world. The second sentence refers to an object in the actual world, but the predicate does not obtain in the actual world. Russell's theory thus does not assign different truth-values to the two statements.\n\nIn the Russellian system, the statement “Long John Silver has a wooden leg” and the statement “Long John Silver was one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London” have the same truth value: false. This equality may present problems for those wishing to distinguish such statements in terms of truth value.\n\nSome statements are false with reference to the actual world but potentially true in reference to some fictional world.\nColeridge's poem \"Kubla Khan\" (\"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree\") does not, strictly speaking, suffer reference failure. The 18th century version of the name Kublai Khan picks out a Mongol emperor, the grandson of Genghis Khan. But since few of the events in Coleridge's narrative poem obtain in the actual world, according to Russellian logic, most statements in the poem are false.\n\n"}

Any focus of infection will have a source of infection, and other common traits of such a place include a human community, a vector population, and environmental characteristics adequate for spreading infection.\n\nIn 1854 London physician John Snow discovered that people who drank from a particular water pump contracted cholera, and proposed that drinking this water from this pump was the cause of the illness. At the time people did not readily believe germ theory of disease, instead favoring miasma theory. The discovery of the water pump as a source of infection set a precedent which helped establish epidemiology as a science.\n\nA gay bathhouse is a place where men who have sex with men meet for sex. In the 1980s at the advent of HIV/AIDS many men who used bathhouses for sex developed AIDS as a consequence of their having sex without using safe sex practices for the prevention of HIV/AIDS. Consequently, public health policies found bathhouses to be a place to target for public health intervention.\n\nChildcare infection is the spread of infection during childcare, typically because of contact among children in daycare or school. This happens when groups of children meet in a childcare environment, and there any individual with an infectious disease may spread it to the entire group. Commonly spread diseases include influenza-like illness and enteric illnesses, such as diarrhea among babies using diapers. It is uncertain how these diseases spread, but hand washing reduces some risk of transmission and increasing hygiene in other ways also reduces risk of infection.\n"}
{"id": "2790556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2790556", "title": "Form book", "text": "Form book\n\nA form book is a tool used by attorneys to aid in the filing of pleadings, motions and other legal documents with a court or similar decision-making body. A form book may be a bound volume or binder containing loose-leaf pages, containing forms, clauses and model documents that the attorney might use when preparing a legal document or court pleading.\n\nDue to the exacting nature of legal forms and the time and effort required to prepare legal documents, form books were created as an aid in the drafting process. These books conserve time and serve as a reference to attorneys and law students seeking to use them in their practice. The importance of these books is not to be underestimated, as a form lacking proper language or information may jeopardize court proceedings.\n\nForms can contain standard language to be used in court proceedings, or may more closely resemble a template which is to be filled in based on case specifics. Forms found in form books are often used as a reference, as the document that will be used must be tailored specifically to the court and situation in which it will be presented. In some cases, such as patent and bankruptcy, certain forms are legally required.\n\nForm books may be arranged chronologically, alphabetically, by subject, or by jurisdiction. They may also include additional resources such as outlines, research references, annotations, state considerations, and law practice checklists in addition to the forms.\n\nThe style, format, and information required in court documents differs from one jurisdiction to another, between different levels of courts in a system, and between different areas of law. Therefore, the companies that publish casebook and other legal materials often publish form books as well, offering selections specific to the location and type of practice in which their customers are engaged. Many publishers offer the forms in their books on computer discs. Some books may be accompanied by CD-ROMs or DVD-ROMs.\n\nThe advent of the Internet has lessened demand for printed form books. Many forms are now distributed freely by various courts, and others are available for free or online purchase. Forms online may be offered with drafting tools and other resources.\n\nThere are several different categories of form books available. These differ in their organization, subject, and the nature of the information contained.\n\nGeneral form books usually fall into one of two categories: transactional, or covering pleading and practice processes. Transactional (or legal) forms give examples of contracts, wills, leases, deeds, mortgages, and other substantive matters. Pleading and practice forms provide formatting and examples for legal language to be used in various court motions such as complaints, answers, and motions to dismiss. General form books are not state specific, and are annotated and cross-referenced. They are usually arranged alphabetically or encyclopedically and may provide a topical index to aid researchers in finding specific forms.\n\nPublishers can provide form books that discuss a specific type of practice. Topics which might have their own form books include real estate, business law, and tax.\n\nMost states have form books containing state-specific forms. These can be published by various entities such as state courts or individual state bar association organizations. Other court systems may publish their own materials as well.\n\nAnother type of form book is designed for those seeking legal forms but not trained as lawyers, commonly referred to as a “self-help” form book. Topics included could be leases, wills, and contracts.\n\nTypical forms included in a form book are a model complaint, answer, motion to compel discovery, motion for summary judgment, and request for permission to appeal. Other types of forms include:\nTransactional forms used to draft wills, contracts, and documents\n\n"}
{"id": "12743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12743", "title": "Garrison Keillor", "text": "Garrison Keillor\n\nGary Edward \"Garrison\" Keillor (born August 7, 1942) is an American author, storyteller, humorist, voice actor, and radio personality. He is best known as the creator of the Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) show \"A Prairie Home Companion\" (called \"Garrison Keillor's Radio Show\" in some international syndication), which he hosted from 1974 to 2016. Keillor created the fictional Minnesota town Lake Wobegon, the setting of many of his books, including \"Lake Wobegon Days \"and \"\". Other creations include Guy Noir, a detective voiced by Keillor who appeared in \"A Prairie Home Companion\" comic skits. Keillor is also the creator of the five-minute daily radio/podcast program \"The Writer's Almanac\", which pairs one or two poems of his choice with a script about important literary, historical, and scientific events that coincided with that date in history.\n\nIn November 2017, Minnesota Public Radio cut all business ties with Keillor after an allegation of inappropriate behavior with a freelance writer for \"A Prairie Home Companion\". On April 13, 2018, MPR and Keillor announced a settlement that allows archives of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"The Writer's Almanac\" to be publicly available again, and soon thereafter, Keillor began publishing new episodes of \"The Writer's Almanac\" on his website.\n\nKeillor was born in Anoka, Minnesota, the son of Grace Ruth (\"née\" Denham) and John Philip Keillor. His father was a carpenter and postal worker who was half-Canadian with English ancestry; Keillor's paternal grandfather was from Kingston, Ontario. His maternal grandparents were Scottish emigrants from Glasgow.\n\nKeillor's family belonged to the Plymouth Brethren, an Evangelical Christian movement that he has since left. In 2006, he told \"Christianity Today\" that he was attending the St. John the Evangelist Episcopal church in Saint Paul, Minnesota, after previously attending a Lutheran church in New York.\n\nKeillor graduated from Anoka High School in 1960 and from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor's degree in English in 1966. During college, he began his broadcasting career on the student-operated radio station known today as Radio K.\n\nIn his 2004 book \"Homegrown Democrat: A Few Plain Thoughts from the Heart of America\", Keillor mentions some of his noteworthy ancestors, including Joseph Crandall, who was an associate of Roger Williams, who founded Rhode Island and the first American Baptist church; and Prudence Crandall, who founded the first African-American women's school in America.\n\nGarrison Keillor started his professional radio career in November 1969 with Minnesota Educational Radio (MER), later Minnesota Public Radio (MPR), which today distributes programs under the American Public Media (APM) brand. He hosted a weekday drive-time broadcast called \"A Prairie Home Entertainment\", on KSJR FM at St. John's University in Collegeville. The show's eclectic music was a major divergence from the station's usual classical fare. During this time he submitted fiction to \"The New Yorker\" magazine, where his first story for that publication, \"Local Family Keeps Son Happy,\" appeared in September 1970.\n\nKeillor resigned from \"The Morning Program\" in February 1971 in protest of what he considered interference with his musical programming; as part of his protest, he played nothing but the Beach Boys' \"Help Me, Rhonda\" during one broadcast. When he returned to the station in October, the show was dubbed \"A Prairie Home Companion\".\n\nKeillor has attributed the idea for the live Saturday night radio program to his 1973 assignment to write about the Grand Ole Opry for \"The New Yorker\", but he had already begun showcasing local musicians on the morning show, despite limited studio space. In August 1973, MER announced plans to broadcast a Saturday night version of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" with live musicians.\n\n\"A Prairie Home Companion\" (\"PHC\") debuted as an old-style variety show before a live audience on July 6, 1974; it featured guest musicians and a cadre cast doing musical numbers and comic skits replete with elaborate live sound effects. The show is punctuated by spoof commercial spots for \"PHC\" fictitious sponsors such as Powdermilk Biscuits, the Ketchup Advisory Board, and the Professional Organization of English Majors (POEM); it presents parodic serial melodramas, such as \"The Adventures of Guy Noir, Private Eye\" and \"The Lives of the Cowboys.\" Keillor voices Noir, the cowboy Lefty, and other recurring characters, and provides lead or backup vocals for some of the show's musical numbers. The show airs from the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul.\n\nAfter the show's intermission, Keillor reads clever and often humorous greetings to friends and family at home submitted by members of the theater audience in exchange for an honorarium. Also in the second half of the show, Keillor delivers a monologue called \"The News from Lake Wobegon\", a fictitious town based in part on Keillor's own hometown of Anoka, Minnesota, and on Freeport and other small towns in Stearns County, Minnesota, where he lived in the early 1970s. Lake Wobegon is a quintessentially Minnesota small town characterized by the narrator as a place \"... where all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.\"\nThe original \"PHC\" ran until 1987, when Keillor ended it to focus on other projects. In 1989, he launched a new live radio program from New York City, \"The American Radio Company of the Air\", which had essentially the same format as \"PHC\". In 1992, he moved ARC back to St. Paul, and a year later changed the name back to \"A Prairie Home Companion\"; it has remained a fixture of Saturday night radio broadcasting ever since.\n\nOn a typical broadcast of \"A Prairie Home Companion\", Keillor's name is not mentioned unless a guest addresses him by name, although some sketches feature Keillor as his alter ego, Carson Wyler. In the closing credits, which Keillor reads, he gives himself no billing or credit except \"written by Sarah Bellum,\" a joking reference to his own brain.\n\nKeillor regularly takes the radio company on the road to broadcast from popular venues around the United States; the touring production typically features local celebrities and skits incorporating local color. In April 2000, he took the program to Edinburgh, Scotland, producing two performances in the city's Queen's Hall, which were broadcast by BBC Radio. He toured Scotland with the program to celebrate its 25th anniversary. (In the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, the program is known as \"Garrison Keillor's Radio Show\".) Keillor has produced broadcast performances similar to \"PHC\" but without the \"Prairie Home Companion\" brand, as in his 2008 appearance at the Oregon Bach Festival. He was also the host of \"The Writer's Almanac,\" from 1993 to 2017, which, like \"PHC\", was produced and distributed by American Public Media.\n\nIn a March 2011 interview, Keillor announced that he would be retiring from \"A Prairie Home Companion\" in 2013; but in a December 2011 interview with the \"Sioux City Journal\", Keillor said: \"The show is going well. I love doing it. Why quit?\" During an interview on July 20, 2015, Keillor announced his intent to retire from the show after the 2015–2016 season, saying, \"I have a lot of other things that I want to do. I mean, nobody retires anymore. Writers never retire. But this is my last season. This tour this summer is the farewell tour.\"\n\nKeillor's final episode of the show was recorded live for an audience of 18,000 fans at the Hollywood Bowl in California on July 1, 2016, and broadcast the next day, ending 42 seasons of the show. After the performance, President Barack Obama phoned Keillor to congratulate him. The show continued on October 15, 2016, with Chris Thile as its host.\n\nAt age thirteen, Keillor adopted the pen name \"Garrison\" to distinguish his personal life from his professional writing. He commonly uses \"Garrison\" in public and in other media.\n\nKeillor has been called \"[o]ne of the most perceptive and witty commentators about Midwestern life\" by Randall Balmer in \"Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism.\" He has written numerous magazine and newspaper articles and more than a dozen books for adults as well as children. In addition to writing for \"The New Yorker,\" he has written for \"The Atlantic Monthly\" and \"National Geographic.\" He has also written for Salon.com and authored an advice column there under the name \"Mr. Blue.\" Following a heart operation, he resigned on September 4, 2001, his last column being titled \"Every dog has his day\":\n\nIn 2004 Keillor published a collection of political essays, \"Homegrown Democrat: A Few Plain Thoughts from the Heart of America,\" and in June 2005 he began a column called \"The Old Scout\", which ran at Salon.com and in syndicated newspapers. The column went on hiatus in April 2010 so that he \"... [could] finish a screenplay and start writing a novel.\"\n\nKeillor wrote the screenplay for the 2006 movie \"A Prairie Home Companion,\" directed by Robert Altman. He also appears in the movie.\n\nOn November 1, 2006, Keillor opened an independent bookstore, \"Common Good Books, G. Keillor, Prop.\" in the Blair Arcade Building at the southwest corner of Selby and N. Western Avenues in the Cathedral Hill area in the Summit-University neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota. Upon opening the bookstore, Keillor wrote this poem:\n\nIn April 2012, the store moved to a new location on Snelling Avenue across from Macalester College in the Macalester-Groveland neighborhood.\n\nProbably owing in part to his distinctive North-Central accent, Keillor is often used as a voice-over actor. Some notable appearances include:\n\nIn \"Slate\", Sam Anderson called Keillor \"very clearly a genius. His range and stamina alone are incredible—after 30 years, he rarely repeats himself—and he has the genuine wisdom of a Cosby or Mark Twain.\" But Keillor's \"willful simplicity,\" Anderson wrote, \"is annoying because, after a while, it starts to feel prescriptive. Being a responsible adult doesn't necessarily mean speaking slowly about tomatoes.\" Anderson also noted that in 1985, when \"Time\" magazine called Keillor the funniest man in America, Bill Cosby said, \"That's true if you're a pilgrim.\"\n\nKeillor's style, particularly his speaking voice, has often been parodied.\n\nKeillor is a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. He is tall. He considers himself a loner and prefers not to make eye contact with people. Though not diagnosed, he also considers himself to be on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. He spoke about his experiences as an autistic person in his keynote address at the 19th Annual Minnesota Autism Conference in 2014.\n\nKeillor has been married three times. He was married to Mary Guntzel from 1965 to 1976; they had one son, Jason (born 1969). He was married to Ulla Skaerved, a former exchange student from Denmark at Keillor's high school whom he re-encountered at a class reunion, from 1985 to 1990. He married classical string player Jenny Lind Nilsson (born 1957), who is also from Anoka, in 1995. They have one daughter, Maia Grace Keillor (born December 29, 1997).\n\nBetween his first and second marriages, Keillor was romantically involved with Margaret Moos, who worked as a producer of \"A Prairie Home Companion\".\n\nOn September 7, 2009, Keillor was briefly hospitalized after suffering a minor stroke. He returned to work a few days later.\n\nIn 2005, Keillor's attorneys sent a cease-and-desist letter to MNSpeak.com regarding their production of a T-shirt bearing the phrase \"A Prairie Ho Companion\".\n\nIn 2006, after a visit to a United Methodist church in Highland Park, Texas, Keillor created a local controversy with his remarks about the event, including the rhetorical suggestion of a connection between event participants and supporters of torture and a statement creating an impression of political intimidation: \"I walked in, was met by two burly security men ... and within 10 minutes was told by three people that this was the Bushes' church and that it would be better if I didn't talk about politics.\" In response, the lecture series coordinator said the two \"burly security men\" were a local policeman and the church's own security supervisor, both present because the agreement with Keillor's publisher specified that the venue provide security. In addition the coordinator said that Keillor arrived at the church, declined an introduction and took the stage without an opportunity to mingle with the audience, so he did not know when these warnings might have been dispensed. The publicist concurred, saying that Keillor did not have contact with any church members or people in the audience before he spoke. Supposedly, before Keillor's remarks, participants at the event had considered the visit to have been cordial and warm. Asked to respond, Keillor stuck to his story, describing the people who advised him not to discuss politics and saying that he did not have security guards at other stops on the tour.\n\nIn 2007, Keillor wrote a column that in part criticized \"stereotypical\" gay parents, who he said were \"sardonic fellows with fussy hair who live in over-decorated apartments with a striped sofa and a small weird dog and who worship campy performers.\" In response to the strong reactions of many readers, Keillor said:\n\nIn 2008, Keillor created a controversy in St. Paul when he filed a lawsuit against his neighbor's plan to build an addition on her home, citing his need for \"light and air\" and a view of \"open space and beyond\". Keillor's home is significantly larger than others in his neighborhood and it would still be significantly larger than his neighbor's with its planned addition. Keillor came to an undisclosed settlement with his neighbor shortly after the story became public.\n\nIn 2009, one of Keillor's \"Old Scout\" columns contained a reference to \"lousy holiday songs by Jewish guys\" and a complaint about \"Silent Night\" as rewritten by Unitarians, upsetting some readers. A Unitarian minister named Cynthia Landrum responded, \"Listening to him talk about us over the years, it's becoming more and more evident that he isn't laughing with us — he's laughing at us\", while Jeff Jacoby of the \"Boston Globe\" called Keillor \"cranky and intolerant\".\n\nOn November 29, 2017, the \"Star Tribune\" reported that Minnesota Public Radio was terminating all business relationships with Keillor as a result of \"allegations of his inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him.\" In January 2018, MPR CEO Jon McTaggart elaborated that they had received allegations of \"dozens\" of sexually inappropriate incidents from the individual, including requests for sexual contact. Keillor has denied any wrongdoing and said his firing stems from an incident when he touched a woman's bare back while trying to console her. He stated he apologized to her soon after, that they had already made up, and that he was surprised to hear the allegations when her lawyer called.\n\nIn its statement of termination, MPR announced that Keillor would keep his executive credit for the show, but that since he owns the trademark for the phrase \"prairie home companion\", they would cease rebroadcasting episodes of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" featuring Keillor and remove the trademarked phrase from the radio show hosted by Chris Thile. MPR also eliminated its business connections to PrairieHome.org and stopped distributing Keillor's daily program \"The Writer's Almanac\". \"The Washington Post\" also canceled Keillor's weekly column when they learned he had continued writing columns, including a controversial piece criticizing Al Franken's resignation because of sexual misconduct allegations, without revealing that he was under investigation at MPR. Several fans wrote MPR to protest his firing, and within the month, 153 members had canceled their memberships because of it. In January 2018, Keillor announced he was in mediation with MPR over the firing. On January 23, 2018, MPR News reported further on the investigation after interviewing almost 60 people who had worked with Keillor. The story described other alleged sexual misconduct by Keillor, and a $16,000 severance check for a woman who was asked to sign a confidentiality agreement to prevent her from talking about her time at MPR (she refused and never deposited the check).\n\nKeillor received a letter from the MPR CEO, Jon McTaggart, dated April 5, 2018, confirming that both sides wanted archives of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"The Writer's Almanac\" to be publicly available again. The archives were restored at the end of April 2018, to be hosted by MPR for no longer than three years per the agreement between Keillor and MPR, after which the archives will move to a new online home.\n\n\nKeillor's work in print includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Within this site is a cleared area lined by boulders that is thought to have been used for rituals, dances or athletic competitions. This site could have held 25-30 people and is believed to be a congregation site for microbands during the rainy seasons of the Archaic period.\n\nGheo-Shih is located in the Oaxaca Valley, which is in the Southwestern highlands of present day Mexico. The site is roughly 100 by 150 m (about 1.5 ha), and has an elevation of 1,660 m. During the rainy season (June through September) there was an abundance of mesquite pods and fruit as well as planted squash and gourds.\n\nExcavation of Gheo-shih began in 1967 through the University of Michigan, the lead archaeologists were Frank Hole and husband and wife team Kent Flannery and Joyce Marcus. Original excavation found two stratigraphic components, the uppermost being dated to 5000-4000 BC and the lower portion being dated to roughly 7000 BC.\n\nExcavation of the lower section uncovered the most prominent feature of the site, a set of parallel lines of boulders 7 by 20 m in size, this cleared area was almost completely devoid of artifacts. Although there are many theories of what this area may have been used for, the most commonly accepted are those of Flannery and Marcus. In correlation with the understanding of the social structure and culture of micro/macrobands Flannery and Marcus believe that this open area was used for rituals, dances and possibly athletic competitions. This theory correlates with the understanding that macroband rituals of the Archaic period were “ad hoc,” meaning that they were not associated with dates or times but performed when there was the largest number of people possibly present. \n\nAlso found at this site were metate and mano (stone) fragments, atlatl points as well as areas of lapidary work with pebbles and chipped stone manufacturing. There were also oval rings of stone that are believed to be the remnants of walls from residential structures. All of these finds were found around the cleared area.\n\nThe dates for this site were found using Carbon-14 dating on two pieces of charcoal, most likely burnt twigs, found in the lower stratified portion. The dates associated with these pieces are 7630-7570 BC and 7720-7560 BC.\n\nGheo-shih is thought to have been occupied during the Archaic period when bands and microbands were prominent. Archaeologists think that at this time family-sized microbands spent lean seasons apart from each other and then came together at larger sites during abundant seasons to form macrobands. Because of archaeological evidence such as abundant food sources and evidence of nonsubsistence actives such as lapidary work, Gheo-shih is thought to be one of these larger sites occupied by macrobands. It is also believed that when these macrobands were formed “ad hoc” rituals and/or athletic competitions would be performed because the maximum number of people would be present. This explains the common theories behind Gheo-shih's main feature, the boulder lined cleared area.\n\nThere is archaeological evidence of lapidary work at Gheo-shih. Small pebbles with carved holes in them have been found and it is believed that these were mainly decorative ornaments. This find is significant as it shows that the people living there had the time and manpower to devote to nonsubsistence related activities. This as well supports the macroband theory.\n\nThere is some controversy surrounding Gheo-shih in the field of archaeology. Some archaeologists disagree with Flannery and Marcus' theories about the boulder lined cleared area found there. Many argue that the rocks could have moved over time, or that with many time periods represented in one place it is hard to distinguish between them. Archaeologist Marcus Winter from the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History in Oaxaca believes that the boulders may in fact be a road built in the Spanish colonial times. Marcus argues in response that there are no other artifacts from the colonial times found at that site and that there is distinct stratigraphy to demarcate time periods.\n"}

The first plate, left by Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog, is the oldest-known artifact of European exploration in Australia still in existence. The original dish was returned to the Netherlands where it is on display in the Rijksmuseum. A replacement and additional dish were subsequently discovered on three additional visits over the next 200 years\n\nDirk Hartog was the first confirmed European to see Western Australia, reaching it in his ship, the \"Eendracht\". On 26 October 1616, he landed at Cape Inscription on the very northernmost tip of the island. Before departing, Hartog left behind a pewter dinner plate, nailed to a post and placed upright in a fissure on the cliff top.\n\nThe plate bears the inscription:\n\n1616, DEN 25 OCTOBER IS HIER AENGECOMEN HET SCHIP D EENDRACHT\nVAN AMSTERDAM, DEN OPPERKOPMAN GILLIS MIBAIS VAN LVICK SCHIPPER DIRCK HATICHS VAN AMSTERDAM \nONDERCOOPMAN JAN STINS OPPERSTVIERMAN PIETER DOEKES VAN BIL Ao 1616.\nTranslated into English:\n\nOn the 25th October, arrived here the ship Eendracht of\nAmsterdam; the upper merchant, Gilles Mibais of Luyck; Captain Dirk\nHartog of Amsterdam; the 27th ditto set sail for Bantam; undermerchant\nJan Stein, upper steersman, Pieter Doekes from Bil, Ao, 1616.\n81 years later, in 1697, the Dutch sea captain Willem de Vlamingh also reached the island and discovered Hartog's pewter dish with the post almost rotted away. He removed it and replaced it with another plate which was attached to a new post. The new post was made of a cypress pine trunk taken from Rottnest Island. The original dish was returned to the Netherlands, where it is still kept in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. De Vlamingh's replacement dish contains all of the text of Hartog's original plate as well as listing the senior crew of his own voyage. It concludes with:\n1697.

Sailed from\nhere with our fleet on the 12th, to explore the South Land, and\nafterwards bound for Batavia.\nIn 1801, the French captain of the \"Naturaliste\" Jacques Félix Emmanuel Hamelin, second in command of an expedition led by Nicolas Baudin in the \"Geographe\" entered Shark Bay and sent a party ashore. The party found Vlamingh's plate, even though it was half buried in the sand, as the post had rotted away with the ravages of the weather. When they took the plate to the ship, Hamelin ordered it to be returned, believing its removal would be tantamount to sacrilege. He also had a plate, or similar, of his own prepared and inscribed with details of his voyage (at 16 July 1801) and he had both erected at the Vlamingh site, adding even a small Dutch flag to the plaque. It was then named Cape Inscription.\n\nIn 1818 in the \"Uranie\", French explorer Louis de Freycinet, who had been an officer in Hamelin's 1801 crew, sent a boat ashore to recover Vlamingh's plate and substituted a lead plate, which has never been found. His wife Rose de Freycinet, who was on board, having stowed away with her husband's assistance, recorded the event in what was in effect a diary of her circumnavigation. After being shipwrecked in the Falkland Islands the plate and other materials from the \"Uranie\" voyage were later transferred to another ship and taken to France, where it was presented to the Académie française in Paris.\n\nAfter being lost for more than a century, the Vlamingh plate was rediscovered in 1940 on the bottom shelf of a small room, mixed up with old copper engraving plates. In recognition of Australian losses in the defence of France during the two world wars, the plate was eventually returned to Australia in 1947 and is currently housed in the Western Australian Maritime Museum in Fremantle, Western Australia.\n\nMarking the location in 1938, the Commonwealth government commemorated Dirk Hartog's landing with a brass plaque.\n\nJust short of 60 years later, on 12 February 1997, the then premier of Western Australia Richard Court unveiled a bronze plaque to mark the tricentennial of Vlamingh's visit.\n\nThe lighthouse and plaques are located at .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14891", "title": "Incremental reading", "text": "Incremental reading\n\nIncremental reading is a software-assisted method for learning and retaining information from reading, helping with the creation of flashcards out of electronic articles read in portions inside a prioritized reading list.\n\nIt is particularly targeted to people who are trying to learn for life a large amount of information, particularly if that information comes from various sources.\n\n\"Incremental reading\" means \"reading in portions\". Instead of a linear reading of articles one at a time, the method works by keeping a large reading list of electronic articles or books (often dozens or hundreds of them) and reading parts of several articles in each session. Articles in the reading list are prioritized by the user.\n\nIn the course of reading, key points of articles are broken up into flashcards, which are then learned and reviewed over an extended period of time with the help of a spaced repetition algorithm.\n\nThis use of flashcards at later stages of the process is based on psychological principles of long-term memory storage and retrieval, in particular the spacing effect (the phenomenon whereby learning is greater when studying is spread out over time) and the testing effect (the finding that long-term memory is increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving the to-be-remembered information through testing).\n\nCurrent implementations include spaced repetition software Anki – through an add-on – and SuperMemo. There is also incremental reading support for the text editors Emacs and Yi.\n\nThe method itself is often credited to the Polish software developer Piotr Wozniak. He implemented the first version of incremental reading in 1999 in SuperMemo 99, providing the essential tools of the method: a prioritized reading list, and the possibility to extract portions of articles and to create cloze deletions. The term \"incremental reading\" itself appeared the next year with SuperMemo 2000. Later SuperMemo programmes subsequently enhanced the tools and techniques involved, such as webpage imports, material overload handling, etc.\n\nLimited incremental reading support for the text editor Emacs appeared in 2007.\n\nAn Anki add-on for incremental reading was later published in 2011; for Anki 2.0 and 2.1, another add-on is available.\n\nIncremental reading was the first of a series of related concepts invented by Piotr Wozniak: incremental image learning, incremental video, incremental audio, incremental mail processing, incremental problem solving, and incremental writing. \"Incremental learning\" is the term Wozniak uses to refer to those concepts as a whole.\n\nWhen reading an electronic article, the user extracts the most important parts (similar to underlining or highlighting a paper article) and gradually distills them into flashcards. Flashcards are information presented in a question-answer format (making active recall possible). Cloze deletions are often used in incremental reading, as they are easy to create out of text. Both extracts and flashcards are scheduled independently from the original article.\n\nWith time and reviews, articles are supposed to be gradually converted into extracts, and extracts into flashcards. Hence, incremental reading is a method of breaking down information from electronic articles into sets of flashcards.\n\nContrary to extracts, flashcards are reviewed with active recall. This means that extracts such as \"George Washington was the first U.S. President\" must ultimately be converted into questions such as \"Who was the first U.S. President?\" (Answer: George Washington), or \"Who was George Washington?\" (Answer: the first U.S. President), etc, or cloze deletions such as \"[BLANK] was the first U.S. President\", \"George Washington was [BLANK]\", etc.\n\nThis flashcard creation process is semi-automated – the reader chooses which material to learn and edits the precise wording of the questions, while the software assists in prioritizing articles and making the flashcards, and does the scheduling: it calculates the ideal time for the reader to review each chunk, according to the rules of spaced repetition. This means that all processed pieces of information are presented at increasing intervals.\n\nIndividual articles are read in portions proportional to the attention span, which depends on the user, their mood, the article, etc. This allows for a substantial gain in attention, according to Piotr Wozniak.\n\nWithout the use of spaced repetition, the reader would quickly get lost in the glut of information when studying dozens of subjects in parallel. However, spaced repetition makes it possible to retain traces of the processed material in memory.\n\n"}
{"id": "9404862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9404862", "title": "Jersey dolmens", "text": "Jersey dolmens\n\nThe dolmens of Jersey are neolithic sites, including dolmens, in Jersey. They range over a wide period, from around 4800 BC to 2250 BC, these dates covering the periods roughly designated as Neolithic, or “new stone age”, to Chalcolithic, or “copper age”.\n\nBefore that, the dolmen La Cotte de St Brelade has evidence of habitation both by our near cousins, the Neanderthals, and early man. These come from the Paleolithic or “old stone age”, and belong to the period of the hunter-gatherer, where the tribe would forage in pursuit of food. In the case of La Cotte, as we know from remains, woolly mammoth was part of the diet.\n\nBy the time the dolmens came to be built, people were settled in Jersey, although it was still at that time connected by a land bridge to the continent of Europe (until around 6800 BC). The new stone age differs from the old in that stone tools were still used – axes, daggers etc. – but the community was now settled and farmed the land; they did not hunt and follow prey.\n\nOf their habitations, no trace remains; it is likely from the evidence found elsewhere that they had fairly basic wooden huts, sealed with mud and clay, which have been lost. Only the dolmens and menhirs remain.\n\nThe Neolithic sites such as dolmens, passage graves and the like used to be considered to be primarily tombs of chieftains.\n\nPossibly drawing from the Egyptian model, a tribe was imagined as labouring away to build a burial site of stone for a mighty chieftain, much as the workers in Egypt had done for the pharaohs. Beliefs of ancient Egypt have survived in written form, and it seems clear that the embalmed body of the king was entombed underneath or within the pyramid to protect it and allow his transformation and ascension to the afterlife, and a place among the gods. A new pharaoh would mean a new tomb, a new pyramid, often built in fairly close proximity to others.\n\nBut the Neolithic sites do not seem to function like that. They are scattered. There is no easy way of seeing that someone was special, singled out. Bodies were often defleshed (left so that the flesh rotted away) or burnt before interment. Ancient Jewish burials – where a tomb was used – then the bones gathered up and placed in a burial casket – show a similarity of practice.\n\nThis is also completely unlike Celtic burials, where tribal chieftains were often buried with their chariots, and grave goods ( though horses were apparently usually too valuable to bury with their owner). It is immediately clear with these burials that they were for a man of stature and importance within the tribe. The one site – unfortunately inaccessible – in Jersey where this is seen is Hougue Boete.\n\nBut with the dolmens, as Mark Patton has pointed out, the human remains found are few in number, and sometimes (as La Sergenté) non-existent. This is also the case in Brittany, where animal bones can be found, and not human bones, suggesting that these \"passage graves\" were never intended for burials, and certainly not for burials of chieftains. On the most prominent Jersey site, he comments: “the bones are scattered in the passage and chamber with no apparent organisation, as at La Hougue Bie, Jersey”..\nIn fact, on many sites in Britain and Europe, over the Neolithic period, these tombs were opened and new interments made. One site had five different methods of burial for only twice that number of people.\n\nSo if these sites were not tombs, what were they for? Mark Patton suggest that a useful analogy is that of churches and cathedrals. He argues: \"If one were to excavate Westminster Abbey, one would find human bones, as in most cathedrals and churches, yet Westminster Abbey, although it contains burials, would not in itself be described as a tomb or mausoleum\", and suggests that we look at the dolmens in this light. The historian Ronald Hutton comes to much the same conclusion, that these sites were mainly used as religious centres, and each would have been a \"focus for a group of scattered farms or a settlement, bonded as a clan or family\" - very much a precursor to the idea of a \"parish\".\n\nSo how are to understand the dolmens. Mark Patton suggests that we can imagine the tribes coming together, for various significant times of the year, to celebrate in ritual the passage of the seasons.\n\nBihet notes that pouques or fairies have a particularly strong connection to the folklore of the dolmens.\n\nThe major sites in Jersey are listed below:\n\n\nThis Neolithic passage grave is in the Parish of St Martin. It is a 5 metre long passage leading into a large circular chamber beyond which is a large capstoned end chamber. Several smaller side chambers and cists form the edges of the main chamber. Human bones from at least three individuals have been recovered as well as pottery, stone axes and flints.\n\nThis Neolithic passage grave is in the Parish of St Ouen.\n\nIt has a fine passage chamber with one side chamber to the north. The passage and side chamber retain their capstones. Excavation in 1912 located the skeletons of eight people, seven adult and one child. Seven were lying on their sides in a crouched position and the eighth in a seated position within the passage. Animal bones, pottery, shells and pebbles were also found.\n\nMark Patton (1987) noted that there was a considerable degree of variation in terms of funerary practices and how the dead were treated. In Mont Grantez, \"seven articulated skeletons were found (six were in flexed positions in the chamber, the seventh was apparently placed in a seated position in the chamber). Disarticulated remains, however, are more usual, suggesting prior exposure or burial of the corpse.\"\n\nThis unusual passage grave is found in the Parish of St Brelade. It is a circular chamber with a short passage entrance. The original excavation in 1923 found a large amount of rubble within that was probably the fallen remains of a corbelled, bee-hive shaped vault. The style is unique to the Channel Islands.\n\nIt is sited on open land west of Le Parcq de L'Oeillière, with a line of sight to La Table des Marthes.\n\nMark Patton noted that the corbelled vault required a rock such as schist, which fractures to give long, flat slabs, and in Jersey, the available rock was not suitable. Consequently, while La Sergenté is the earliest passage grave in Jersey, it collapsed soon after its construction, because of the unsuitable building materials available, and was not repeated elsewhere in the Islands.(Patton 1987a).\n\nA neolithic passage chamber in the parish of St Ouen; it was largely ruined by quarrying prior to the initial excavation in 1929. More recent excavations (1985-1990) revealed a D shaped chamber that was extended to form an open rectangular chamber probably in Neolithic times. A vast number of finds included pottery, flint scrapers, arrowheads and broken querns.\n\nMark Patton comments: “There are three passage graves in Jersey (Le Mont de la Ville, Faldouet and La Hougue des Géonnais) which have large, open chambers. The chambers of these monuments cannot have been roofed with capstones (the uprights are too small to have supported capstones large enough to span the chambers), and corbelled vaulting would be impractical given the character of the available stone. It is conceivable that these chambers had wooden roofs, but recent excavations at La Hougue des Géonnais provided no evidence for this. Assuming that the chambers were open, the cairns of these monuments cannot have covered the chambers whilst they were in use, and must rather have formed a sort of platform around an open ‘arena’.”\n\nA large flat granite slab at the western end of The Railway Walk where it meets La Rue de la Corbière. When examined in 1850 it was found to be supported at each end by pillars of stones and earth. Pottery, burnt stones and broken stone axes were found. It is unknown what kind of purpose it was used for or what kind of structure it is part of.\n\nIt has been suggested that it is a huge capstone from the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age (about 2500 to 3000 BC). In historical times, it was used by the Jersey people as a place for signing contracts. Because of this it may have been allowed to stand by the side of the now disused St Helier to La Corbière railway, while so many other sites were partially destroyed for building material.\n\nThe name, which may be interpreted as \"La Table des Martyres\" and consequently translated as \"The Witnesses' Table\", probably derives from this known custom of signing important documents at the slab.\n\nLe Pinacle is a natural rock formation that resembles a gigantic menhir. The site itself is positioned below the imposing Le Pinacle, which is on the west of Le Chemin des Landes. The path down to the site is treacherous, and in recent times has seen two tragic deaths. It is inadvisable to go down unless with properly qualified climbers.\n\nThere are two earth and rubble ramparts that archaeologists have attributed to the Neolithic/Chalcolithic periods and a third that they have attributed to the Bronze Age. Six pieces of iron found at the site have been attributed to Iron Age occupation. In Roman times the site held a rectangular Gallo-Roman temple. Amongst the large number of finds from various excavations are flints, hammers, rubbers, polishing stones, a copper arrow head, bronze spear head, wheel turned pottery and a Roman coin.\n\nMark Patton comments: “Recent research has demonstrated the existence of an axe production centre at Le Pinacle, Jersey, and ‘Type P’ dolerite axes produced at Le Pinacle have been identified in assemblages from Guernsey, Sark and Alderney as well as Jersey. Axes of Type P dolerite, however, seem not to be found on the Armorican mainland. “\n\nThis is a high oval mound in the Parish of St John. Here a four sided Neolithic chamber was found when tunnelled into by excavators in 1911. The cist was found to contain an unusual burial, that of a man lying on top of a horse. Other reported finds included a round bottomed vessel and fragment of a greenstone axe. The horse bones were carbon dated to the Celtic period. It seems likely that the site was built in Neolithic times then re-used in Celtic times for a chieftain’s burial.\n\nThis is the only known megalithic cist with a round mound of its type in the Channel Islands and may be culturally linked to early Neolithic cists in south Brittany. The site is also of interest as the location of a seigniorial court.\n\nThe Duke of Normandy granted lands here in Jersey to his favoured subjects. They became Seigneur of a fief, often living in a manor house, centrally placed in the area. Anyone living in a fief became a 'tenant' paying rent to the church (usually a tenth of their grain crops) and working for an agreed number of days on the Seigneur's land. The system worked well because tenants had the use of the Seigneurial mill, saving them many hours of work, and disputes between tenants were settled by the Seigneurial court. Incidentally, the Seigneur did not preside over the court most of the time, but left it to deputies, or “prévôts”.\n\nOriginally every Seigneurial Court had its Prévôt. appointed annually on some Fiefs by the Seigneur, on others by the Tenants, \"to guard the rights of the Seigneur and the tenants, to make good all summonses and loyal records, and to pay the corn-rentes, fermes, and extracts\". He had to enforce all orders of the Court and all bye-laws of the Fief.\n\nThis is a Neolithic passage grave in Parish of St Clement.\n\nWhen it was discovered it 1848, the capstones were blasted and removed by quarrymen for building materials. Inside were found human bones, urns, axes and a polished stone pendant. The local farmer who was responsible for the blasting then used the remaining upright stones as a pigsty until it was reclaimed as a historic site.\n\nThis is a gallery grave in the Parish of St Martin. Le Couperon is about an eight-meters long capstoned chamber that a long mound had originally covered. It was surrounded by a ring of eighteen outer stones, known as peristaliths. It was well-known at least as early as 1748 as Daniel Defoe mentions it in his tour guide to Great Britain.\n\nThe site was first excavated in 1868. By that time the capstones had fallen into the chamber. The excavators lifted these and a porthole stone, and restored the dolmen to what the excavators believed was its original form. Unfortunately, a farmer digging up the mound had scattered the peristaliths. In 1919, the Société Jersiaise moved the porthole stone to its current position at the eastern end of the chamber. However, archeologists believe that originally porthole stone may have stood within the chamber, dividing it into two segments of unequal length, each with its own entrance. Finds at the site included a few flint flakes and pottery fragments.\n\nThe dolmen stands within a few metres of the Le Couperon guardhouse, which was built in 1689, and which for more than a century off-and-on housed the garrison of a nearby battery.\n\nWhen Jacquetta Hawkes wrote \"The Archaeology of the Channel Islands\", she mentioned \"the Beaker people\" who spread across Europe, possibly from the Iberian peninsula. They were defined by a distinctive pottery style - a beaker with a distinctive bell-shaped profile - that spreads across the Western continent around 2000 B.C. Burial customs of the Beaker people included placing their dead in round barrows, often with a beaker, perhaps to hold a drink for the dead on their final journey. Evidence of such beakers and artefacts have been found in Jersey at Ville ès Nouaux.\n\nThe existence of the migratory \"Beaker people\" is still very much the popular position. Richard R. Doornek writing in the magazine \"School Arts\" in 1989 on Stonehenge mentions that about 2100 BC, \"the Beaker people, named after their highly sophisticated pottery, arrived in Britain from the Continent through the Low Countries. Geoffrey Humphrys also writes on Stonehenge in the magazine \"Contemporary Review\" (1994), and again we hear that \"about 2100 BC, the Beaker people are reckoned to have started erecting two circles of bluestones\".\n\nBut many historians and archaeologists now believe that the Beaker people did not exist as a group; as Mark Patton explains, the beakers and related artefacts that are attributed to the Beaker people may well indicate the migration of a \"beaker culture\" rather than a \"beaker people\". This is most succinctly summed up by Ronald Hutton:\n\n\"One of the major developments in British archaeology during the past twenty years has been the loss of confidence by its practitioners in their ability to recognise the movement of peoples. The problem is that an existing population can adopt foreign artefacts and fashions so completely as to appear to have been replaced by foreigners. Thus, according to traditional archaeological practice, had modern Britain been an illiterate society then it would have been natural to have spoken of the invasion of the 'Washing Machine People' in the 1950s and large-scale Japanese immigration in the 1970s.\"\n\nThe recent discovery of the burial of the \"Amesbury Archer\" in Wiltshire, however, has brought the idea of a \"Beaker people\" to the fore again. This individual was clearly a high status male, buried with copper tools and gold jewellery as well as beakers, and oxygen isotope analysis on his teeth indicates that he grew up in central Europe, possibly Switzerland or Austria. Immigration clearly happened, but not necessarily on a large scale: the arrival of a small number of immigrants, bringing with them new technologies, skills and ideas, may have provoked a profound change in the nature of society.\n\nIn 2012, Jersey Post issued a five-stamp set of stamps, designed by Andrew Robinson, each of which featured one of five dolmens: Mont Ubé, Le Couperon, Ville-és-Nouaux, Les Monts Grantez and La Pouquelaye de Faldouet. Le Couperon is on the 55 pence stamp.\n\n\n"}

Since 1931, it has been part of the British Museum's ethnographic collection.\n\nThe Luzira Head is a unique terracotta bust of a woman. The head has very narrow, protruding eyes and mouth with a diminutive nose. Along the forehead are three cicatrices. The hair is matted and falls either side of the head. The lower part of the figure was also found during the original excavations. It is tripod-shaped and like the head is hollow and made of baked clay.\n\nThe head and torso, along with a number of other artefacts, were excavated by the British geologist EJ Wayland between 1929 and 1930. They were unearthed in a prison compound at the site of Luzira, in the suburbs of Kampala, Uganda. Other objects discovered at the time included over one hundred pottery sherds, fourteen terracotta pieces, a pottery vessel, an iron spear and an axe. It is conjectured that the site was once an ancient Buganda shrine. Radio-carbon dating has indicated that the objects found there are approximately a thousand years old.\n\n"}

Supposedly the site was built in about 4000 BC, corresponding to the Dnieper-Donets or early Yamna culture, and remained in use throughout the Bronze Age and well into the Iron Age, until 5th century BC Sarmatia. It was discovered in 2004, and the discovery officially announced on 7 September 2006.\n\nThe site was discovered in 2004 by school children participating in an archaeology camp organised by Alchevsk history teacher Vladimir Paramonov, who has been organising expeditions of schoolchildren to the hill range since 1995.\n\nIt is believed that much of the site was constructed about 3000 BC, in the early Bronze Age. The site is believed to be a complex of temples and sacrificial altars topping a hill with sides sculpted into steps.\n\nViktor Klochko, the archaeologist in charge of the dig site and deputy Minister of Science of the Tourism and Protection of Cultural Heritage Department of the Lugansk regional administration, said that the discovery was of international significance as the first monument of its kind found in Eastern Europe:\n\nArchaeologists have confirmed that evidence of graves has been found at the Luhansk site, which they believe to have been the result of human sacrifice, rather than due to its use as a burial ground.\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", remains of sacrifice victims, ashes and ceramics have been found at the site, but no jewellery or treasure. The complex has a base area of three-quarters of a square mile, is estimated to be 60 metres (192 ft) high, and was probably used for 2,000 years.\n\nIn Kurgan No. 4, three graves of the Berezhnovsko-Maevskaya group of the Late Bronze Age Srubna culture were found above three graves of the Early Bronze Age Catacomb culture, with 13 graves and sacrificial pits. One of the skulls found was dated to ca. 3000 BC. Four stone statues were found near the graves.\n\nInitial reports indicated that archaeologists had discovered a pyramidal structure.\n\nKlochko blamed the press: \"I'm not sure where the pyramid idea came from - the media got it wrong,\" says Klochko. \"We didn't find anything like an Egyptian pyramid. Though the site is on a hill. But it's interesting enough in its own right.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "196565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=196565", "title": "Mora (linguistics)", "text": "Mora (linguistics)\n\nA mora (plural \"morae\" or \"moras\"; often symbolized μ) is a unit in phonology that determines syllable weight, which in some languages determines stress or timing. The definition of a mora varies. In 1968, American linguist James D. McCawley defined it as \"something of which a long syllable consists of two and a short syllable consists of one\". The term comes from the Latin word for \"linger, delay\", which was also used to translate the Greek word \"chronos\" (time) in its metrical sense.\n\nMonomoraic syllables have one mora, bimoraic syllables have two, and trimoraic syllables have three, although this last type is relatively rare.\n\nIn general, morae are formed as follows:\n\n\nIn general, monomoraic syllables are called \"light syllables\", bimoraic syllables are called \"heavy syllables\", and trimoraic syllables (in languages that have them) are called \"superheavy syllables\". Some languages, such as Old English and present-day English, can have syllables with up to four morae.\n\nA prosodic stress system in which moraically heavy syllables are assigned stress is said to have the property of quantity sensitivity.\n\nFor the purpose of determining accent in Ancient Greek, short vowels have one mora, and long vowels and diphthongs have two morae. Thus long ē (eta: η) can be understood as a sequence of two short vowels: ee.\n\nAncient Greek pitch accent is placed on only one mora in a word. An acute (έ, ή) represents high pitch on the only mora of a short vowel or the last mora of a long vowel (\"é, eé\"). A circumflex (ῆ) represents high pitch on the first mora of a long vowel (\"ée\").\n\nIn Old English, short diphthongs and monophthongs were monomoraic, long diphthongs and monophthongs were bimoraic, consonants ending a syllable were each a mora, and geminate consonants added a mora to the preceding syllable. In Modern English, the rules are similar, except that all diphthongs are bimoraic. In English, and likely also in Old English, syllables cannot have more than 4 morae, with loss of sounds occurring if a syllable would have more than 4 otherwise. From the Old English period through to today, all content words must be at least 2 morae long.\n\nIn Luganda, a short vowel constitutes one mora while a long vowel constitutes two morae. A simple consonant has no morae, and a doubled or prenasalised consonant has one. No syllable may contain more than three morae. The tone system in Luganda is based on morae. (See Luganda tones.)\n\nGilbertese, an Austronesian language spoken mainly in Kiribati, is a trimoraic language. The typical foot in Gilbertese contains three morae. These trimoraic constituents are units of stress in Gilbertese. These \"ternary metrical constituents of the sort found in Gilbertese are quite rare cross-linguistically, and as far as we know, Gilbertese is the only language in the world reported to have a ternary constraint on prosodic word size.\"\n\nIn Hawaiian, both syllables and morae are important. Stress falls on the penultimate mora, though in words long enough to have two stresses, only the final stress is predictable. However, although a diphthong, such as \"oi,\" consists of two morae, stress may fall only on the first, a restriction not found with other vowel sequences such as \"io.\" That is, there is a distinction between \"oi,\" a bimoraic syllable, and \"io,\" which is two syllables.\n\nMost dialects of Japanese, including the standard, use morae, known in Japanese as \"haku\" (拍) or \"mōra\" (モーラ), rather than syllables, as the basis of the sound system. Writing Japanese in kana (hiragana and katakana) is said by those scholars who use the term \"mora\" to demonstrate a moraic system of writing. For example, in the two-syllable word \"mōra\", the \"ō\" is a long vowel and counts as two morae. The word is written in three symbols, モーラ, corresponding here to , each containing one mora. Such scholars also argue that the 5/7/5 pattern of the haiku in modern Japanese is of morae rather than syllables.\n\nThe Japanese syllable-final \"n\" is also said to be moraic, as is the first part of a geminate consonant. For example, the Japanese name for \"Japan\", 日本, has two different pronunciations, one with three morae (\"Nihon\") and one with four (\"Nippon\"). In the hiragana spelling, the three morae of \"Ni-ho-n\" are represented by three characters (にほん), and the four morae of \"Ni-p-po-n\" need four characters to be written out as にっぽん.\n\nSimilarly, the names \"Tōkyō\" (\"to-u-kyo-u\" とうきょう), \"Ōsaka\" (\"o-o-sa-ka\" おおさか), and \"Nagasaki\" (\"na-ga-sa-ki\" ながさき) all have four morae, even though, on this analysis, they can be said to have two, three and four syllables, respectively. The number of morae in a word is not always equal to the number of graphemes when written in kana; for example, even though it has four morae, the Japanese name for \"Tōkyō\" (とうきょう) is written with five graphemes, because one of these graphemes (ょ) represents a Yōon, a feature on the Japanese writing system that indicates that the preceding mora is palatalized.\n\nIn India, the mora was an acknowledged phenomenon well over two millennia ago in ancient Indian linguistics schools studying the dominant scholarly and religious lingua franca of Sanskrit. The mora was first expressed in India as the \"mātrā\".\n\nFor example, the short vowel \"\"a\" (pronounced like a schwa) is assigned a value of one mātrā, the long vowel \"ā\" is assigned a value of two mātrās, and the compound vowel (diphthong) \"ai\" (which has either two simple short vowels, \"a\"+\"i\", or one long and one short vowel, \"ā\"+\"i\") is assigned a value of two mātrās.\n\nSanskrit prosody and metrics have a deep history of taking into account moraic weight, as it were, rather than straight syllables, divided into \"laghu\" (लघु, \"light\") and \"dīrgha\" / \"guru\" (दीर्घ / गुरु, \"heavy\"\") feet based on how many morae can be isolated in each word.\n\nThus, for example, the word \"kartŗ\", meaning \"agent\" or \"doer\", does not contain, contrary to intuitive English prosodic principles, simply two syllabic units, but contains rather, in order, a \"\"dīrgha\" / \"guru\" \"/ \"heavy\" foot and a \"laghu\" / \"light\" foot. The reason is that the conjoined consonants 'rt' render the normally light 'ka' syllable heavy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "209538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=209538", "title": "Nim Li Punit", "text": "Nim Li Punit\n\nNim Li Punit () is a Maya Classic Period site in the Toledo District of the nation of Belize, located 40 kilometres north of the town of Punta Gorda, at 16° 19' N, 88° 47' 60W. Nim Li Punit is sometimes known as Big Hat or Top Hat; the name is Kekchi Maya for \"Big Hat\", referring to the large elaborate head-dress on a stela sculpture found on site depicting one of the site's ancient kings.\n\nNim Li Punit is a medium-sized site from the Maya Classic Period, flourishing from the 5th century AD through the 8th century AD. It consists of structures around three plazas, including several step-pyramids, the tallest being 12.2 meters high. The site has a number of carved stelae illustrating the ancient city's rulers. Several stelae are in an unfinished state, suggesting a sudden halt to work. The site is near Belize's Southern Highway and is open to visitors subject to an admission charge.\n\nNim Li Punit is situated in the foothills of the Maya Mountains with proximity to clear mountain streams. The Maya Mountains form a nearly impenetrable backdrop forest to the north and east, while the expansive somewhat swampy coastal lowlands adjoining the Caribbean Sea lie to the east. Low-lying swampland between the Sarstoon and Temash Rivers is situated to the south. The site is within two kilometres of Belize's Southern Highway, accessed by an unpaved road. (The Southern Highway itself is paved in the vicinity of the site as well.) Area soils are relatively fertile for tropical standards, and explain the region's ability to support sizeable prehistoric settlements such as Nim Li Punit. Local sandstones are found in nearby stream and river beds, and these materials were used as the principal building stones for the site's structures and stelae. The Maya Mountains and foothills are among the oldest surface rock formations of Central America ; these Paleozoic sediments were uplifted about 200 million years ago in the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and early Permian periods.\n\nThe ancient city of Nim Li Punit was laid out in a fashion consistent with other Mayan lowland Classic Era sites, such as Lubaantun, Pusilha and Uxbenka; the latter two of these sites are deemed to have arisen earlier than the former two. Nim Li Punit is constructed in the Classic Period prototypical geometric form, using large amounts of fill material to achieve expansive level plazas and terraces; furthermore, the arrangement of the major structures emulates the view of the Mayan cosmological world, setting the earth realm at the core, manifested by a dwelling of the ruler. The sky world is exhibited characteristically in the north by shrines and burial structures. The location of the ballcourt is intermediary, illustrating the position of this activity to represent perpetual conflict between the forces of life and death. The ballcourt is so well preserved, it appears ready to host a game.\n\nIt is thought that within the Plaza of the Stela in the South Group that there is an \"E Group\" geometry that would have been used for astronomical observations. For example, several monuments present before a long terrace known as Structure One, which mark the location of solstices and equinoxes. Unlike Lubaantun, where dry-stone construction was employed, the stone structures are cemented with Mayan mortar; moreover, the elaborate notched jointing often found in Lubaantun is absent in Nim Li Punit.\n\nThe peak population of Nim Li Punit is estimated to have been in the range of 5000 to 7000 people during the peak occupation Late Classic period. Early occupiers of this site probably migrated from Guatemala, similar to the history of nearby Lubaantun. The peoples of Nim Li Punit are thought to have spoken a dialect of the Cholan language, which is that spoken in the Mayan heartland. Evidence from carved stelae document the site was active in the period 721 to 790 AD, based upon actual Mayan calendar dates inscribed on at least six different stones. As at many other Mayan sites occupation of Nim Li Punit ceased rather suddenly in the 9th century AD, probably associated with areawide overpopulation exceeding the region's carrying capacity of the then prevalent milpa farming system. The Nim Li Punit population is thought to have been aligned with Mayan settlements such as Tikal in the Petén Basin region of Guatemala. The visitors' center indicates that this site had political and social connections with Copan in Honduras.\n\nNim Li Punit is situated in a locale rich in forest, soil, rock and other natural resources. These assets, coupled with proximity to ample flowing mountain streams, provided the aboriginal Maya at Nim Li Punit a resource base that allowed their civilisation to thrive. While most of the surrounding broadleaf tropical rainforest is secondary growth, due to the disturbance of the Maya themselves, there is considerable biodiversity of trees, herbs, mammals, birds, reptiles and other life forms. In addition to the soils being able to support basic prehistoric staple crops of beans and corn, there are diverse herbs in the vicinity known to have been used by the \"ancient ones\" for medicinal purposes.\n\nMammals found in the area include two primates: Yucatán black howler monkey, \"Alouatta pigra\" and Central American spider monkey, \"Ateles geoffroya\". Numerous rodents are found here including the common paca, \"Agouti paca\". A variety of carnivores are present, such as the cougar \"Puma concolor\" and jaguar \"Panthera onca\". Further, hosts of bats and birds frequent the present forest as they did the ancient forest.\n\nNim Li Punit was discovered in 1976 with initial explorations conducted by Norman Hammond of the British Museum-Cambridge University. Hammond produced the first site map and excavated a portion of the central plaza. Barbara McLeod of the University of Texas, Austin, then produced the first detailed analyses of stelae inscriptions. Richard Levanthal in 1983 bored test pits and surveyed the site as part of an overall southern Belize Mayan mapping project. In the 1990s minor excavations were conducted by the Belize Department of Archaeology under the supervision of John Morris and Juan Luis Bonor. In 2015, tomb excavations were conducted by the Toledo Regional Interaction Project directed by Geoffrey Braswell. This excavation unearthed numerous clay pots and a large jade pendant inscribed with Mayan hieroglyphs.\n\n"}

It was originally composed by Captain George Thatcher Balch, a Union Army Officer during the Civil War and later a teacher of patriotism in New York City schools. The form of the pledge used today was largely devised by Francis Bellamy in 1892, and formally adopted by Congress as the pledge in 1942. The official name of \"The Pledge of Allegiance\" was adopted in 1945. The most recent alteration of its wording came on Flag Day in 1954, when the words \"under God\" were added.\n\nCongressional sessions open with the recital of the Pledge, as do many government meetings at local levels, and meetings held by many private organizations. All states except Hawaii, Iowa, Vermont and Wyoming require a regularly scheduled recitation of the pledge in the public schools, although the Supreme Court has ruled in \"West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette\" that students cannot be compelled to recite the Pledge, nor can they be punished for not doing so. In a number of states, state flag pledges of allegiance are required to be recited after this.\n\nThe United States Flag Code says:\n\nThe Pledge of Allegiance, as it exists in its current form, was composed in August 1892 by Francis Bellamy (1855–1931), who was a Baptist minister, a Christian socialist, and the cousin of socialist utopian novelist Edward Bellamy (1850–1898). There did exist a previous version created by Captain George T. Balch, a veteran of the Civil War, who later became auditor of the New York Board of Education. Balch's pledge, which existed contemporaneously with the Bellamy version until the 1923 National Flag Conference, read:\n\nBalch was a proponent of teaching children, especially those of immigrants, loyalty to the United States, even going so far as to write a book on the subject and work with both the government and private organizations to distribute flags to every classroom and school. Balch's pledge, which predates Bellamy's by 5 years and was embraced by many schools, by the Daughters of the American Revolution until the 1910s, and by the Grand Army of the Republic until the 1923 National Flag Conference, is often overlooked when discussing the history of the Pledge. Bellamy, however, did not approve of the pledge as Balch had written it, referring to the text as \"too juvenile and lacking in dignity.\" The Bellamy \"Pledge of Allegiance\" was first published in the September 8 issue of the popular children's magazine \"The Youth's Companion\" as part of the National Public-School Celebration of Columbus Day, a celebration of the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas. The event was conceived and promoted by James B. Upham, a marketer for the magazine, as a campaign to instill the idea of American nationalism in students and to encourage children to raise flags above their schools. According to author Margarette S. Miller, this campaign was in line both with Upham's patriotic vision as well as with his commercial interest. According to Miller, Upham \"would often say to his wife: 'Mary, if I can instill into the minds of our American youth a love for their country and the principles on which it was founded, and create in them an ambition to carry on with the ideals which the early founders wrote into The Constitution, I shall not have lived in vain.\n\nBellamy's original Pledge read:\n\nThe Pledge was supposed to be quick and to the point. Bellamy designed it to be recited in 15 seconds. As a socialist, he had initially also considered using the words \"equality\" and \"fraternity\" but decided against it, knowing that the state superintendents of education on his committee were against equality for women and African Americans.\n\nFrancis Bellamy and Upham had lined up the National Education Association to support the \"Youth's Companion\" as a sponsor of the Columbus Day observance and the use in that observance of the American flag. By June 29, 1892, Bellamy and Upham had arranged for Congress and President Benjamin Harrison to announce a proclamation making the public school flag ceremony the center of the Columbus Day celebrations. This arrangement was formalized when Harrison issued Presidential Proclamation 335. Subsequently, the Pledge was first used in public schools on October 12, 1892, during Columbus Day observances organized to coincide with the opening of the World's Columbian Exposition (the Chicago World's Fair), Illinois.\n\nIn his recollection of the creation of the Pledge, Francis Bellamy said, \"At the beginning of the nineties patriotism and national feeling was (sic) at a low ebb. The patriotic ardor of the Civil War was an old story ... The time was ripe for a reawakening of simple Americanism and the leaders in the new movement rightly felt that patriotic education should begin in the public schools.\" James Upham \"felt that a flag should be on every schoolhouse,\" so his publication \"fostered a plan of selling flags to schools through the children themselves at cost, which was so successful that 25,000 schools acquired flags in the first year (1892–93).\n\nAs the World's Columbian Exposition was set to celebrate the 400th anniversary the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas, Upham sought to link the publication's flag drive to the event, \"so that every school in the land ... would have a flag raising, under the most impressive conditions.\" Bellamy was placed in charge of this operation and was soon lobbying \"not only the superintendents of education in all the States, but [he] also worked with governors, Congressmen, and even the President of the United States.\" The publication's efforts paid off when Benjamin Harrison declared Wednesday October 12, 1892, to be Columbus Day for which \"The Youth's Companion\" made \"an official program for universal use in all the schools.\" Bellamy recalled that the event \"had to be more than a list of exercises. The ritual must be prepared with simplicity and dignity.\"\n\nEdna Dean Proctor wrote an ode for the event, and \"There was also an oration suitable for declamation.\" Bellamy held that \"Of course, the nub of the program was to be the raising of the flag, with a salute to the flag recited by the pupils in unison.\" He found \"There was not a satisfactory enough form for this salute. The Balch salute, which ran, \"I give my heart and my hand to my country, one country, one language, one flag,\" seemed to him too juvenile and lacking in dignity.\" After working on the idea with Upham, Bellamy concluded, \"It was my thought that a vow of loyalty or allegiance to the flag should be the dominant idea. I especially stressed the word 'allegiance'. ... Beginning with the new word allegiance, I first decided that 'pledge' was a better school word than 'vow' or 'swear'; and that the first person singular should be used, and that 'my' flag was preferable to 'the.'\" Bellamy considered the words \"country, nation, or Republic,\" choosing the last as \"it distinguished the form of government chosen by the founding fathers and established by the Revolution. The true reason for allegiance to the flag is the Republic for which it stands.\" Bellamy then reflected on the sayings of Revolutionary and Civil War figures, and concluded \"all that pictured struggle reduced itself to three words, one Nation indivisible.\"\n\nBellamy considered the slogan of the French Revolution, \"Liberté, égalité, fraternité\" (\"liberty, equality, fraternity\"), but held that \"fraternity was too remote of realization, and … [that] equality was a dubious word.\" Concluding \"Liberty and justice were surely basic, were undebatable, and were all that any one Nation could handle. If they were exercised for all. They involved the spirit of equality and fraternity.\"\n\nAfter being reviewed by Upham and other members of \"The Youth's Companion\", the Pledge was approved and put in the official Columbus Day program. Bellamy noted that \"in later years the words 'to my flag' were changed to 'to the flag of the United States of America' because of the large number of foreign children in the schools.\" Bellamy disliked the change, as \"it did injure the rhythmic balance of the original composition.\"\n\nIn 1906, The Daughters of the American Revolution's magazine, \"The American Monthly\", listed the \"formula of allegiance\" as being the Balch Pledge of Allegiance, which reads:\n\nIn subsequent publications of the Daughters of the American Revolution, such as in 1915's \"Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Continental Congress of the Daughters of the American Revolution\" and 1916's annual \"National Report,\" the Balch Pledge, listed as official in 1906, is now categorized as \"Old Pledge\" with Bellamy's version under the heading \"New Pledge.\" However, the \"Old Pledge\" continued to be used by other organizations until the National Flag Conference established uniform flag procedures in 1923.\n\nIn 1923, the National Flag Conference called for the words \"my Flag\" to be changed to \"the Flag of the United States,\" so that new immigrants would not confuse loyalties between their birth countries and the US. The words \"of America\" were added a year later. Congress officially recognized the Pledge for the first time, in the following form, on June 22, 1942:\n\nLouis Albert Bowman, an attorney from Illinois, was the first to suggest the addition of \"under God\" to the pledge. The National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution gave him an Award of Merit as the originator of this idea. He spent his adult life in the Chicago area and was chaplain of the Illinois Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. At a meeting on February 12, 1948, he led the society in reciting the pledge with the two words \"under God\" added. He said that the words came from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Although not all manuscript versions of the Gettysburg Address contain the words \"under God\", all the reporters' transcripts of the speech as delivered do, as perhaps Lincoln may have deviated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when he said \"that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom.\" Bowman repeated his revised version of the Pledge at other meetings.\n\nIn 1951, the Knights of Columbus, the world's largest Catholic fraternal service organization, also began including the words \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance. In New York City, on April 30, 1951, the board of directors of the Knights of Columbus adopted a resolution to amend the text of their Pledge of Allegiance at the opening of each of the meetings of the 800 Fourth Degree Assemblies of the Knights of Columbus by addition of the words \"under God\" after the words \"one nation.\" Over the next two years, the idea spread throughout Knights of Columbus organizations nationwide. On August 21, 1952, the Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus at its annual meeting adopted a resolution urging that the change be made universal, and copies of this resolution were sent to the President, the Vice President (as Presiding Officer of the Senate), and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The National Fraternal Congress meeting in Boston on September 24, 1952, adopted a similar resolution upon the recommendation of its president, Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart. Several State Fraternal Congresses acted likewise almost immediately thereafter. This campaign led to several official attempts to prompt Congress to adopt the Knights of Columbus policy for the entire nation. These attempts were eventually a success.\n\nAt the suggestion of a correspondent, Representative Louis C. Rabaut (D-Mich.), of Michigan sponsored a resolution to add the words \"under God\" to the Pledge in 1953.\n\nBefore February 1954, no endeavor to get the pledge officially amended had succeeded. The final successful push came from George MacPherson Docherty. Some American presidents honored Lincoln's birthday by attending services at the church Lincoln attended, New York Avenue Presbyterian Church by sitting in Lincoln's pew on the Sunday nearest February 12. On February 7, 1954, with President Eisenhower sitting in Lincoln's pew, the church's pastor, George MacPherson Docherty, delivered a sermon based on the Gettysburg Address entitled \"A New Birth of Freedom.\" He argued that the nation's might lay not in arms but rather in its spirit and higher purpose. He noted that the Pledge's sentiments could be those of any nation: \"There was something missing in the pledge, and that which was missing was the characteristic and definitive factor in the American way of life.\" He cited Lincoln's words \"under God\" as defining words that set the US apart from other nations.\n\nPresident Eisenhower had been baptized a Presbyterian very recently, just a year before. He responded enthusiastically to Docherty in a conversation following the service. Eisenhower acted on his suggestion the next day and on February 8, 1954, Rep. Charles Oakman (R-Mich.), introduced a bill to that effect. Congress passed the necessary legislation and Eisenhower signed the bill into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954. Eisenhower said:\n\nThe phrase \"under God\" was incorporated into the Pledge of Allegiance on June 14, 1954, by a Joint Resolution of Congress amending § 4 of the Flag Code enacted in 1942.\n\nOn October 6, 1954, the National Executive Committee of the American Legion adopted a resolution, first approved by the Illinois American Legion Convention in August 1954, which formally recognized the Knights of Columbus for having initiated and brought forward the amendment to the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nEven though the movement behind inserting \"under God\" into the pledge might have been initiated by a private religious fraternity and even though references to God appear in previous versions of the pledge, historian Kevin M. Kruse asserts that this movement was an effort by corporate America to instill in the minds of the people that capitalism and free enterprise were heavenly blessed. Kruse acknowledges the insertion of the phrase was influenced by the push-back against Russian atheistic communism during the Cold War, but argues the longer arc of history shows the conflation of Christianity and capitalism as a challenge to the New Deal played the larger role.\n\nSwearing of the Pledge is accompanied by a salute. An early version of the salute, adopted in 1887, known as the Balch Salute, which accompanied the Balch pledge, instructed students to stand with their right hand outstretched toward the flag, the fingers of which are then brought to the forehead, followed by being placed flat over the heart, and finally falling to the side.\n\nIn 1892, Francis Bellamy created what was known as the Bellamy salute. It started with the hand outstretched toward the flag, palm down, and ended with the palm up. Because of the similarity between the Bellamy salute and the Nazi salute, which was adopted in Germany later, the US Congress stipulated that the hand-over-the-heart gesture as the salute to be rendered by civilians during the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem in the US would be the salute to replace the Bellamy salute. Removal of the Bellamy salute occurred on December 22, 1942, when Congress amended the Flag Code language first passed into law on June 22, 1942. Attached to bills passed in Congress in 2008 and then in 2009 (Section 301(b)(1) of title 36, United States Code), language was included which authorized all active duty military personnel and all veterans in civilian clothes to render a proper hand salute during the raising and lowering of the flag, when the colors are presented, and during the National Anthem.\n\nA musical setting for \"The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag\" was created by Irving Caesar, at the suggestion of Congressman Louis C. Rabaut whose House Resolution 243 to add the phrase \"under God\" was signed into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954.\n\nThe composer, Irving Caesar, wrote and published over 700 songs in his lifetime. Dedicated to social issues, he donated all rights of the musical setting to the U.S. government, so that anyone can perform the piece without owing royalties.\n\nIt was sung for the first time on the floor of the House of Representatives on Flag Day, June 14, 1955 by the official Air Force choral group the \"Singing Sergeants\". A July 29, 1955 House and Senate resolution authorized the U.S. Government Printing Office to print and distribute the song sheet together with a history of the pledge.\n\nOther musical versions of the Pledge have since been copyrighted, including by Beck (2003), Lovrekovich (2002 and 2001), Roton (1991), Fijol (1986), and Girardet (1983).\n\nIn 1940, the Supreme Court, in \"Minersville School District v. Gobitis\", ruled that students in public schools, including the respondents in that case—Jehovah's Witnesses who considered the flag salute to be idolatry—could be compelled to swear the Pledge. In 1943, in \"West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette\", the Supreme Court reversed its decision. Justice Robert H. Jackson, writing for the 6 to 3 majority, went beyond simply ruling in the precise matter presented by the case to say that public school students are not required to say the Pledge on narrow grounds, and asserted that such ideological dogmata are antithetical to the principles of the country, concluding with:\n\nIn a later case, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals held that students are also not required to stand for the Pledge.\nRequiring or promoting of the Pledge on the part of the government has continued to draw criticism and legal challenges on several grounds.\n\nOne objection is that a democratic republic built on freedom of dissent should not require its citizens to pledge allegiance to it, and that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right to refrain from speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech in the context of the ritual of pledging allegiance. Another objection is that the people who are most likely to recite the Pledge every day, small children in schools, cannot really give their consent or even completely understand the Pledge they are making. Another criticism is that a government requiring or promoting the phrase \"under God\" violates protections against the establishment of religion guaranteed in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nIn 2004, linguist Geoffrey Nunberg said the original supporters of the addition thought that they were simply quoting Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, but to Lincoln and his contemporaries, \"under God\" meant \"God willing\", so they would have found its use in the Pledge of Allegiance grammatically incorrect and semantically odd.\n\nProminent legal challenges were brought in the 1930s and 1940s by Jehovah's Witnesses, a denomination whose beliefs preclude swearing loyalty to any power other than God, and who objected to policies in public schools requiring students to swear an oath to the flag. They said requiring the pledge violated their freedom of religion guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The first case was in 1935, when two children, Lillian and William Gobitas, ages ten and twelve, were expelled from the Minersville, Pennsylvania, public schools that year for failing to salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nIn a 2002 case brought by atheist Michael Newdow, whose daughter was being taught the Pledge in school, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the phrase \"under God\" an unconstitutional endorsement of monotheism when the Pledge was promoted in public school. In 2004, the Supreme Court heard \"Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow\", an appeal of the ruling, and rejected Newdow's claim on the grounds that he was not the custodial parent, and therefore lacked standing, thus avoiding ruling on the merits of whether the phrase was constitutional in a school-sponsored recitation. On January 3, 2005, a new suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of three unnamed families. On September 14, 2005, District Court Judge Lawrence Karlton ruled in their favor. Citing the precedent of the 2002 ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Karlton issued an order stating that, upon proper motion, he would enjoin the school district defendants from continuing their practices of leading children in pledging allegiance to \"one Nation under God.\"\n\nIn 2006, in the Florida case \"Frazier v. Alexandre\", a federal district court in Florida ruled that a 1942 state law requiring students to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. As a result of that decision, a Florida school district was ordered to pay $32,500 to a student who chose not to say the pledge and was ridiculed and called \"unpatriotic\" by a teacher.\n\nIn 2009, a Montgomery County, Maryland, teacher berated and had school police remove a 13-year-old girl who refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance in the classroom. The student's mother, assisted by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, sought and received an apology from the teacher, as state law and the school's student handbook both prohibit students from being forced to recite the Pledge.\n\nOn March 11, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the words \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance in the case of \"Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District\". In a 2–1 decision, the appellate court ruled that the words were of a \"ceremonial and patriotic nature\" and did not constitute an establishment of religion. Judge Stephen Reinhardt dissented, writing that \"the state-directed, teacher-led daily recitation in public schools of the amended 'under God' version of the Pledge of Allegiance... violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\"\n\nOn November 12, 2010, in a unanimous decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston affirmed a ruling by a New Hampshire lower federal court which found that the pledge's reference to God does not violate non-pledging students' rights if student participation in the pledge is voluntary. A United States Supreme Court appeal of this decision was denied on June 13, 2011.\n\nIn September 2013, a case was brought before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, arguing that the pledge violates the Equal Rights Amendment of the Constitution of Massachusetts. In May 2014, Massachusetts' highest court ruled that the pledge does not discriminate against atheists, saying that the words \"under God\" represent a patriotic, not a religious, exercise.\n\nIn February 2015 New Jersey Superior Court Judge David F. Bauman dismissed a lawsuit, ruling that \"… the Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the rights of those who don't believe in God and does not have to be removed from the patriotic message.\" The case against the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District had been brought by a student of the district and the American Humanist Association that argued that the phrase \"under God\" in the pledge created a climate of discrimination because it promoted religion, making non-believers \"second-class citizens.\" In a twenty-one page decision, Bauman wrote, \"Under [the association members'] reasoning, the very constitution under which [the members] seek redress for perceived atheistic marginalization could itself be deemed unconstitutional, an absurd proposition which [association members] do not and cannot advance here.\" Bauman said the student could skip the pledge, but upheld a New Jersey law that says pupils must recite the pledge unless they have \"conscientious scruples\" that do not allow it. He noted, \"As a matter of historical tradition, the words 'under God' can no more be expunged from the national consciousness than the words 'In God We Trust' from every coin in the land, than the words 'so help me God' from every presidential oath since 1789, or than the prayer that has opened every congressional session of legislative business since 1787.”\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "690157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=690157", "title": "Relaxed pronunciation", "text": "Relaxed pronunciation\n\nRelaxed pronunciation (also called condensed pronunciation or word slurs) is a phenomenon that happens when the syllables of common words are slurred together. It is almost always present in normal speech, in all natural languages but not in some constructed languages, such as Loglan or Lojban, which are designed so that all words are parsable.\n\nSome shortened forms of words and phrases, such as contractions or weak forms can be considered to derive from relaxed pronunciations, but a phrase with a relaxed pronunciation is not the same as a contraction. In English, where contractions are common, they are considered part of the standard language and accordingly used in many contexts (except in very formal speech or in formal/legal writing); however, relaxed pronunciation is markedly informal in register. This is also sometimes reflected in writing: contractions have a standard written form, but relaxed pronunciations may not, outside of eye dialect.\n\nCertain relaxed pronunciations occur only in specific grammatical contexts, the exact understanding of which can be complicated. See trace (linguistics) for some further info.\n\nThe following sections contain common words said with relaxed pronunciation in American English, along with pronunciations given in IPA, and a common written indication of this pronunciation where applicable:\n\nThe words \"of\", \"to\", and \"have\" all tend to elide to nothing more than a schwa in many common situations. This sometimes leads to spelling confusion, such as writing \"I could of...\" instead of \"I could have...\" or \"I could've\".\n\"Would\" can also get contracted (\"I'd have done things differently.\"), which usually yields (\"I would have...\" can be \npronounced ). \nNote: The in \"have\" and \"of\" is usually retained before a vowel sound (e.g. in \"I could have \"asked\"...\").\n\n\"You\" tends to elide to (often written \"ya\"). Softening of the preceding consonant also may occur: ( + = , + = , + = , and + = ). This can also happen with other words that begin with (e.g. \"your\", \"yet\", \"year\"). In some dialects, such as Australian English, this is not a relaxed pronunciation but compulsory: got you (never *).\n\n\n\n\nExamples of the Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands include:\n\nOften, especially in Belgian Dutch, the -t at the end of the word is omitted.\n\n\nA wide range of possible pronunciations can be found in the negatory 'nicht\" (\"not\") depending on the dialect region.\n\nSee also Synalepha\n\nThe most notable example in Russian language is the greeting здравствуйте (), which is colloquially pronounced . Other examples include:\n\nContracted forms are usually found only in colloquial contexts, but they can occur in poetry.\n\nFor example, look at the verse from the Russian translation of Avesta (Mihr Yasht, verse 129):\n\"\"On a side of the chariot of Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, stand a thousand ... arrows, with a golden mouth.\"\n\nThis contrasts with contracted forms found in colloquial speech in that it is used to keep the original rhythm. The previous verse (verse 128) has a literary form:\n\n\"On a side of the chariot of Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, stand a thousand bows well-made, with a string of cowgut\".\n\nAmong other relaxed pronunciations, \"tu as\" (you have) is frequently elided to \"t'as\" in colloquial French or \"tu es\" (you are) to \"t'es\".\nThe same with \"je suis\" (I am) to \"j'suis\" or \"ch'uis\" (very informal, or regional), and \"je (ne) sais pas\" (I don't know) to \"j'sais pas\" or \"ch'ais pas\" (very informal, or regional).\nMoreover, most of the negative forms \"ne\" or \"n\"' are lost in non-formal discussion.\nThe expression, \"Qu'est-ce que...\" is little used in colloquial speech for forming the interrogative, but when it is, in very informal use, it is shortened:\n\n\"Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?\" becomes...\n\"Qu'est-c'tu veux ?\"\n\n\"Qu'est-ce que tu as dit?\" becomes...\n\"Qu'est-c't'as dit?\"\n\nA more complex sentence, such as \"il ne savait peut-être plus ce qu'il faisait\" (\"Perhaps he knew no more what he was doing\"), can become \"i n'savait p'têt plus c'qui v'zait\" [in savεp tεt plys kiv zε], or even further relaxed, \"i sa'ait têt' pu c'qui v'zait\" [i saεp tεt pys kiv zε].\n\nForms of the verb \"estar\" (\"to be\") are often shortened by dropping the first syllable (as if the verb were \"*tar\").\n\nOften, \"d\" will turn into its approximant, the Voiced dental fricative, which is \"softer\"; and when placed between two vowels it might disappear in relaxed pronunciation.\n\nAs such, the \"d\" in the final \"-ado\" of past participles can disappear: \"Estoy cansado\" (\"I am tired\") is heard as \"Toy cansao\"; this is also applied to the final \"-ido\", as in *\"Me perdío\" (\"I got lost\").\nThis phenomenon is often perceived as uncultured, and can lead to hypercorrections like *\"bacalado\" instead of \"bacalao\" (\"cod\").\n\nHiatus between two words will often lead to these merging, with \"del\" being the grammatically correct form of \"de el\". If the merged word is small enough, it might be omitted entirely:\n\nSome dialects like Andalusian Spanish lose the syllable-final \"s\".\nSince it is important as a mark of plurals, it is substituted with vowel opening.\n\nExamples:\n\nIn some dialects, \"que\" (that) is reduced to the \"q\" sound:\n\nIn Portugal, the mute 'e' and the final unstressed vowels are often elided:\n\nJapanese can undergo some vowel deletion or consonant mutation in relaxed speech. While these are common occurrences in the formation of some regular words, typically after the syllables \"ku\" or \"tsu\", as in 学校 \"gakkō\" (学 \"gaku\" + 校 \"kō\") \"school\" or 出発 \"shuppatsu\" (出 \"shutsu\" + 発 \"hatsu\") \"departure\", in rapid speech, these changes can appear in words that did not have them before, such as \"suizokkan\" for \"suizokukan\" 水族館 \"aquarium.\"\nAdditionally, the syllables \"ra\", \"ri\", \"ru\", \"re\" and \"ro\" sometimes become simply \"n\" or when they occur before another syllable beginning with \"n\" or \"d\", and disappear entirely before syllabic \"n\". This can happen within a word or between words, such as 分かんない \"wakannai\" \"I dunno\" for 分からない \"wakaranai\" \"I don't know\" or もう来てんだよ \"mō kite n da yo\" \"they're already here\" for もう来ているんだよ \"mō kite iru n da yo\".\n\nRelaxed pronunciation also makes use of several contractions.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nIn all of these cases, the pronounced length of the initial vowel is slightly extended, though in the case of \"napıyon\" the terminal vowel maintains its initial length or, if anything, is shortened.\n\nIn Urdu, it is common to elide the sound /h/ ˂ہ˃ in normal speech. For example, آپ کہاں جا رہے ہیں \"āp kahāṅ jā rahay haiṅ\" will be pronounced آپ کاں جا رے ایں \"āp kān ja rai aiṅ\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15841945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15841945", "title": "Roman glass", "text": "Roman glass\n\nRoman glass objects have been recovered across the Roman Empire in domestic, industrial and funerary contexts. Glass was used primarily for the production of vessels, although mosaic tiles and window glass were also produced. Roman glass production developed from Hellenistic technical traditions, initially concentrating on the production of intensely coloured cast glass vessels. However, during the 1st century AD the industry underwent rapid technical growth that saw the introduction of glass blowing and the dominance of colourless or 'aqua' glasses. Production of raw glass was undertaken in geographically separate locations to the working of glass into finished vessels, and by the end of the 1st century AD large scale manufacturing resulted in the establishment of glass as a commonly available material in the Roman world, and one which also had technically very difficult specialized types of luxury glass, which must have been very expensive.\n\nDespite the growth of glass working in the Hellenistic World and the growing place of glass in material culture, at the beginning of the 1st century AD there was still no Latin word for it in the Roman World. However, glass was being produced in Roman contexts using primarily Hellenistic techniques and styles (see glass, history) by the late Republican period. The majority of manufacturing techniques were time-consuming, and the initial product was a thick-walled vessel which required considerable finishing. This, combined with the cost of importing natron for the production of raw glass, contributed to the limited use of glass and its position as an expensive and high-status material.\n\nThe glass industry was therefore a relatively minor craft during the Republican period; although, during the early decades of the 1st century AD the quantity and diversity of glass vessels available increased dramatically. This was a direct result of the massive growth of the Roman influence at the end of the Republican period, the Pax Romana that followed the decades of civil war, and the stabilisation of the state that occurred under Augustus' rule. Still, Roman glasswares were already making their way from Western Asia (i.e. the Parthian Empire) to the Kushan Empire in Afghanistan and India and as far Han Empire of China. The first Roman glass found in China came from an early 1st-century BC tomb at Guangzhou, ostensibly via the South China Sea.\n\nIn addition to this a major new technique in glass production had been introduced during the 1st century AD. Glassblowing allowed glass workers to produce vessels with considerably thinner walls, decreasing the amount of glass needed for each vessel. Glass blowing was also considerably quicker than other techniques, and vessels required considerably less finishing, representing a further saving in time, raw material and equipment. Although earlier techniques dominated during the early Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods, by the middle to late 1st century AD earlier techniques had been largely abandoned in favour of blowing.\n\nAs a result of these factors, the cost of production was reduced and glass became available for a wider section of society in a growing variety of forms. By the mid-1st century AD this meant that glass vessels had moved from a valuable, high-status commodity, to a material commonly available: \"a [glass] drinking cup could be bought for a copper coin\" (Strabo, Geographica XVI.2). This growth also saw the production of the first glass tesserae for mosaics, and the first window glass, as furnace technology improved allowing molten glass to be produced for the first time. At the same time, the expansion of the empire also brought an influx of people and an expansion of cultural influences that resulted in the adoption of eastern decorative styles. The changes that took place in the Roman glass industry during this period can therefore be seen as a result of three primary influences: historical events, technical innovation and contemporary fashions. They are also linked to the fashions and technologies developed in the ceramic trade, from which a number of forms and techniques were drawn.\nGlass making reached its peak at the beginning of the 2nd century AD, with glass objects in domestic contexts of every kind. The primary production techniques of blowing, and to a lesser extent casting, remained in use for the rest of the Roman period, with changes in vessel types but little change in technology. From the 2nd century onwards styles became increasingly regionalised, and evidence indicates that bottles and closed vessels such as unguentaria moved as a by-product of the trade in their contents, and many appear to have matched the Roman scale of liquid measurement. The use of coloured glass as a decorative addition to pale and colourless glasses also increased, and metal vessels continued to influence the shape of glass vessels. After the conversion of Constantine, glass works began to move more quickly from depicting Pagan religious imagery towards Christian religious imagery. The movement of the capital to Constantinople rejuvenated the Eastern glass industry, and the presence of the Roman military in the western provinces did much to prevent any downturn there. By the mid-4th century mould-blowing was in use only sporadically.\n\nRoman glass production relied on the application of heat to fuse two primary ingredients: silica and soda. Technical studies of archaeological glasses divide the ingredients of glass as formers, fluxes, stabilisers, as well as possible opacifiers or colourants.\n\nRoman glass has also been shown to contain around 1% to 2% chlorine, in contrast to later glasses. This is thought to have originated either in the addition of salt (NaCl) to reduce the melting temperature and viscosity of the glass, or as a contaminant in the natron.\n\nArchaeological evidence for glass making during the Roman period is scarce, but by drawing comparisons with the later Islamic and Byzantine periods, it is clear that glass making was a significant industry. By the end of the Roman period glass was being produced in large quantities contained in tanks situated inside highly specialised furnaces, as the 8-tonne glass slab recovered from Bet She'arim illustrates. These workshops could produce many tonnes of raw glass in a single furnace firing, and although this firing might have taken weeks, a single primary workshop could potentially supply multiple secondary glass working sites. It is therefore thought that raw glass production was centred around a relatively small number of workshops, where glass was produced on a large scale and then broken into chunks. There is only limited evidence for local glass making, and only in context of window glass. The development of this large-scale industry is not fully understood, but Pliny's Natural History (36, 194), in addition to evidence for the first use of molten glass in the mid-1st century AD, indicates that furnace technologies experienced marked development during the early-to-mid-1st century AD, in tandem with the expansion of glass production.\n\nThe siting of glass-making workshops was governed by three primary factors: the availability of fuel which was needed in large quantities, sources of sand which represented the major constituent of the glass, and natron to act as a flux. Roman glass relied on natron from Wadi El Natrun, and as a result it is thought that glass-making workshops during the Roman period may have been confined to near-coastal regions of the eastern Mediterranean. This facilitated the trade in the raw colourless or naturally coloured glass which they produced, which reached glass-working sites across the Roman empire.\n\nThe scarcity of archaeological evidence for Roman glass-making facilities has resulted in the use of chemical compositions as evidence for production models, as the division of production indicates that any variation is related to differences in raw glass making. However, the Roman reliance on natron from Wadi El Natrun as a flux, has resulted in a largely homogenous composition in the majority of Roman glasses. Despite the publication of major analyses, comparisons of chemical analyses produced by different analytical methods have only recently been attempted, and although there is some variation in Roman glass compositions, meaningful compositional groups have been difficult to establish for this period.\n\nThe Roman writers Statius and Martial both indicate that recycling broken glass was an important part of the glass industry, and this seems to be supported by the fact that only rarely are glass fragments of any size recovered from domestic sites of this period. In the western empire there is evidence that recycling of broken glass was frequent and extensive(cullet), and that quantities of broken glassware were concentrated at local sites prior to melting back into raw glass. Compositionally, repeated recycling is visible via elevated levels of those metals used as colourants.\n\nMelting does not appear to have taken place in crucibles; rather, cooking pots appear to have been used for small scale operations. For larger work, large tanks or tank-like ceramic containers were utilised. In the largest cases, large furnaces were built to surround these tanks.\n\nIn comparison to glass making, there is evidence for glass working in many locations across the empire. Unlike the making process, the working of glass required significantly lower temperatures and substantially less fuel. As a result of this and the expansion of the Empire, glass working sites developed in Rome, Campania and the Po Valley by the end of the 1st century BC, producing the new blown vessels alongside cast vessels. Italy is known to have been a centre for the working and export of brightly coloured vessels at this time, with production peaking during the mid-1st century AD.\n\nBy the early-to-mid-1st century AD, the growth of the Empire saw the establishment of glass working sites at locations along trade routes, with Cologne and other Rhineland centres becoming important glass working sites from the Imperial period, and Syrian glass being exported as far as Italy. During this period vessel forms varied between workshops, with areas such as the Rhineland and northern France producing distinctive forms which are not seen further south. Growth in the industry continued into the 3rd century AD, when sites at the Colonia Claudia Agrippinensis appear to have experienced significant expansion, and by the 3rd and early 4th centuries producers north of the Alps were exporting down to the north of Italy and the transalpine regions.\n\nGlass working sites such as those at Aquileia also had an important role in the spread of glassworking traditions and the trade in materials that used hollow glasswares as containers. However, by the 4th and 5th centuries Italian glass workshops predominate.\n\nThe earliest Roman glass follows Hellenistic traditions and uses strongly coloured and 'mosaic' patterned glass. During the late Republican period new highly coloured striped wares with a fusion of dozens of monochrome and lace-work strips were introduced. During this period there is some evidence that styles of glass varied geographically, with the translucent coloured fine wares of the early 1st century notably 'western' in origin, whilst the later colourless fine wares are more 'international'. These objects also represent the first with a distinctly Roman style unrelated to the Hellenistic casting traditions on which they are based, and are characterised by novel rich colours. 'Emerald' green, dark or cobalt blue, a deep blue-green and Persian or 'peacock' blue are most commonly associated with this period, and other colours are very rare. Of these, Emerald green and peacock blue were new colours introduced by the Romano-Italian industry and almost exclusively associated with the production of fine wares.\n\nHowever, during the last thirty years of the 1st century AD there was a marked change in style, with strong colours disappearing rapidly, replaced by 'aqua' and true colourless glasses. Colourless and 'aqua' glasses had been in use for vessels and some mosaic designs prior to this, but start to dominate the blown glass market at this time. The use of strong colours in cast glass died out during this period, with colourless or 'aqua' glasses dominating the last class of cast vessels to be produced in quantity, as mould and free-blowing took over during the 1st century AD.\n\nFrom around 70 AD colourless glass becomes the predominant material for fine wares, and the cheaper glasses move towards pale shades of blue, green, and yellow. Debate continues whether this change in fashion indicates a change in attitude that placed glass as individual material of merit no longer required to imitate precious stones, ceramics, or metal, or whether the shift to colourless glass indicated an attempt to mimic highly prized rock crystal. Pliny's Natural History states that \"the most highly valued glass is colourless and transparent, as closely as possible resembling rock crystal\" (36, 192), which is thought to support this last position, as is evidence for the persistence of casting as a production technique, which produced the thickly walled vessels necessary to take the pressure of extensive cutting and polishing associated with crystal working.\n\nArtisans used a mass of mud and straw fixed around a metal rod to form a core, and built up a vessel by either dipping the core in liquified glass, or by trailing liquid glass over the core. The core was removed after the glass had cooled, and handles, rims and bases were then added. These vessels are characterised by relatively thick walls, bright colours and zigzagging patterns of contrasting colours, and were limited in size to small unguent or scent containers. This early technique continued in popularity during the 1st century BC, despite the earlier introduction of slumped and cast vessels.\n\nThis technique is related to the origin of glass as a substitute for gemstones. By borrowing techniques for stone and carved gems, artisans were able to produce a variety of small containers from blocks of raw glass or thick moulded blanks, including cameo glass in two or more colours, and cage cups (still thought by most scholars to have been decorated by cutting, despite some debate).\n\nThese techniques, which were to dominate the Roman glass working industry after the late 1st century AD, are discussed in detail on the glass blowing page. Mould-blown glass appears in the second quarter of the 1st century AD.\n\nA number of other techniques were in use during the Roman period:\n\n\nThe glass sheets used for slumping could be produced of plain or multicoloured glass, or even formed of 'mosaic' pieces. The production of these objects later developed into the modern caneworking and millefiori techniques, but is noticeably different. Six primary patterns of 'mosaic' glass have been identified:\n\nThe production of multicoloured vessels declined after the mid-1st century, but remained in use for some time after.\n\nGold sandwich glass or gold glass was a technique for fixing a layer of gold leaf with a design between two fused layers of glass, developed in Hellenistic glass and revived in the 3rd century. There are a very fewer larger designs, but the great majority of the around 500 survivals are roundels that are the cut-off bottoms of wine cups or glasses used to mark and decorate graves in the Catacombs of Rome by pressing them into the mortar. The great majority are 4th century, extending into the 5th century. Most are Christian, but many pagan and a few Jewish; their iconography has been much studied, although artistically they are relatively unsophisticated. In contrast, a much smaller group of 3rd century portrait levels are superbly executed, with pigment painted on top of the gold. The same technique began to be used for gold tesserae for mosaics in the mid-1st century in Rome, and by the 5th century these had become the standard background for religious mosaics.\n\nA number of other techniques were in use during the Roman period, including enamelling and engraving.\n\nShards of broken glass or glass rods were being used in mosaics from the Augustan period onwards, but by the beginning of the 1st century small glass tiles, known as tesserae, were being produced specifically for use in mosaics. These were usually in shades of yellow, blue or green, and were predominantly used in mosaics laid under fountains or as highlights.\n\nAround the same time the first window panes are thought to have been produced. The earliest panes were rough cast into a wooden frame on top of a layer of sand or stone, but from the late 3rd century onwards window glass was made by the muff process, where a blown cylinder was cut laterally and flattened out to produce a sheet.\n\nSee also modern glass colors.\n\nThese colours formed the basis of all Roman glass, and although some of them required high technical ability and knowledge, a degree of uniformity was achieved.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1272690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1272690", "title": "Shuafat", "text": "Shuafat\n\nShuafat ( ), also \"Shu'fat\" and \"Sha'fat\", is a mostly Arab neighborhood of East Jerusalem, forming part of north-eastern Jerusalem. Located on the old Jerusalem-Ramallah road about three miles north of the Old City, Shu'fat has a population of 35,000 residents.\n\nNext to the Shu'fat neighbourhood there is a refugee camp of the same name, which was established by King Hussein of Jordan in 1965 to house Palestinian refugees from the Jerusalem, Lydda, Jaffa and Ramleh areas, after the Muascar camp in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City had been closed.\n\nShu'fat borders Pisgat Ze'ev and Beit Hanina on the north, Shu'fat refugee camp on the east, French Hill on the south, and Ramat Shlomo on the west. Shu'fat is located in the part of the West Bank which was included in the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem after its occupation in 1967.\n\nShuafat has been suggested as being the location of several Biblical places. 19th-century researchers have suggested Mizpah in Benjamin, (Conder and Kitchener, 1883) and Nob. (Geikie, 1887) A newer identification names Gebim, but cautions that it's uncertain.\n\nTell el-Ful, a site often identified as Gibeah, is located on the neighbourhood's outskirts.\n\nFollowing a 1991 archaeological dig conducted by Alexander Onn and Tzvi Greenhut which unearthed a 2nd century BCE fortified agricultural settlement near Shuafat, an underground room in the complex was dated to the early first century BCE, and identified as a prayer room or synagogue. Subsequently, this interpretation of the site was strongly questioned. In 2008 Rachel Hachlili stated that the structure is no longer considered to have been a synagogue. The settlement was abandoned after being severely damaged by the 31 BCE earthquake.\n\nJewish tombs dating to this period have also been discovered at Ramat Shlomo, at what was formerly known as Shuafat Ridge. A large quarry, possibly linked to Herod's expansion of the Second Temple, dating to the period has also been found in Ramat Shlomo.\n\nDuring an archaeological salvage dig conducted near the Shuafat refugee camp in preparation for the laying of the tracks for the Jerusalem Light Rail system, the remains of a Jewish settlement from the Roman period were discovered. The settlement was on the main Roman road leading northward from Jerusalem towards Shechem/Flavia Neapolis. It was inhabited between the two main revolts of the Jews against the Romans, as it was established after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE and was suddenly abandoned around 130 CE, short before the outbreak of the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-36). It is described as a 'sophisticated community impeccably planned by the Roman authorities, with orderly rows of houses and two fine public bathhouses to the north.' At the time of its discovery it was said to be the first indication of an active Jewish settlement in the area of Jerusalem after the city fell in 70 CE, and with a presumed total surface area of c. 11 dunams (minimum length 310 m, width c. 35 m), it was also considered the largest Jewish settlement of the time \"in the vicinity of Jerusalem\". The main indication that the settlement was a Jewish one is the large and varied assemblage of chalkstone vessels found there. Such vessels, for food storage and serving, were only used by Jews because they were believed not to transmit impurity. Some of the vessels discovered there belong to a type only found after 70 CE. An even more conclusive archaeological evidence of the Jewish character of a settlement is the presence of Jewish ritual baths, several of which were found during later work. The presence of the public bathhouses, the delay in finding Jewish ritual baths, and the discovery of imported Italian and Greek wine produced by non-Jews, which the very purity-concerned Jews of the time would have avoided, made researchers at first speculate whether the settlement might have been a mixed Jewish-Roman (pagan) one, with the bathhouses operated by Jews for the benefit of Roman soldiers. The quality of the buildings and other findings, such rich coin hoards, cosmetics, stone vessels and imported wine, attest to the wealth of the inhabitants.\n\nThe abandoned or destroyed site was resettled on a smaller scale in the second–fourth centuries CE, with agricultural terraces recently exposed west of Shuʽfat Street.\n\nThe place was known to the Crusaders as \"Dersophath\" or \"Dersophach\". In March 1179, it was noted that its revenues went to the abbey of St Mary of Mount Sion as the result of a grant made by Anselm de Parenti.\n\nRemains of a Crusader structure in the center of the village have been found. Guérin thought it was possibly a church: \"One [house] which still today bears the name \"El-Kniseh\" (the church), presents the remains of a Christian sanctuary facing east, whose windows were pointed and which dates in all likelihood from the Middle Ages. Some fine ashlars of antique appearance had been used, along with other smaller material, in the construction of this little church.\" However, Schick found no church, \"simply an old Crusading building with two preserved windows. The walls are about 6 feet thick, against which the fellaheen houses are built and so it is not easy to recognise. It was a kind of khan built in the usual Crusading way, with a vault a little higher in the middle than semi-circular.\"\n\nArchaeologists discovered that agricultural terraces from the area were built and covered with topsoil during the Mamluk period (1260-1516).\n\nThe village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 Shuafat appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the \"Nahiya\" of Quds of the \"Liwa\" of Quds. It had eight Muslim families who paid taxes on wheat, barley, vineyards and other agricultural produce; a total of 2,200 akçe.\n\nIn 1838, Edward Robinson described Shuafat as a small village with the remains of an old wall, while de Saulcy, who saw it in 1851, wrote that \"this village has the appearance of a castle of the middle ages with a square keep.\"\n\nThe French explorer Guérin visited in 1863 and noted that the village was situated on an elevated plateau \"from which one can make out perfectly the cupolas and minarets of Jerusalem,\" and that it counted 150 inhabitants. He described the houses as for the most part fairly old and vaulted internally. He noted the remains of a church called \"al-Kanisa\", facing east. He thought it was a Frankish church. He also passed by in 1870. An official Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed 23 houses and a population of 90, counting men only. \n\nIn 1883, the Palestine Exploration Fund's \"Survey of Western Palestine\" described Shuafat as \"A small village, standing on a flat spur immediately west of the watershed, surrounded with olive-trees. It has wells to the north. There is a sacred chapel of Sultan Ibrahim in the village.\" In 1896 the population of \"Scha'fat\" was estimated to be about 276 persons.\n\nThe Ottomans built a road in the same place as the old Roman road linking Jerusalem to Nablus.\n\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Sha'afat had a population 422, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 539, still all Muslims, in 123 houses.\n\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Shu'fat was 760, all Muslims, and it had 5,215 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 484 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 2,111 for cereals, while 62 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\n\nThe town of Shuafat was to be the most northernmost point of the \"corpus separatum\" proposed in 1947 for Jerusalem and its surrounding villages, which \"in view of its association with three world religions\" was to be \"accorded special and separate treatment from the rest of Palestine and should be placed under effective United Nations control\".\n\nIn mid-February, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, leader of Palestinian irregulars in the area, tried to persuade the residents of Shuafat to attack the neighbouring Jewish village of Neve Yaakov but the invitation was declined. On 13 May the villagers were evacuated on orders from the Arab Legion. Shortly afterwards the Palmach captured Shuafat, destroying many of the buildings. Shuafat was then occupied by Jordan, which annexed the West Bank in April 1950.\n\nJordan's king Hussein also built a palace here.\n\nIn 1961, the population of Shuafat was 2,541, of whom 253 were Christian.\n\nIn the wake of the 1948 war, the Red Cross accommodated Palestinian refugees in the depopulated and partly destroyed Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. This grew into the Muaska refugee camp managed by UNRWA, which housed refugees from 48 locations now in Israel. Over time many poor non-refugees also settled in the camp. Conditions became unsafe for habitation due to lack of maintenance and sanitation, but neither UNRWA nor the Jordanian government wanted the negative international response that would result if they demolished the old Jewish houses.\n\nIn 1964, a decision was made to move the refugees to a new camp constructed on mostly Jewish land near Shuafat. Most of the refugees refused to move, since it would mean losing their livelihood, the market and the tourists, as well as reducing their access to the holy sites. In the end, many of the refugees were moved to Shuafat by force during 1965 and 1966.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War in 1967, East Jerusalem, including the town and refugee camp, was occupied and later annexed by Israel and were incorporated into the Jerusalem municipal district. The residents were offered Israeli citizenship, but most refused it as they considered the area to be illegally occupied. Many accepted permanent residency status instead.\n\nAccording to ARIJ, Israel has illegally and unilaterally redrawn the boundaries of Jerusalem Municipality, and confiscated 3,989 dunams of Shu’fat land (47% of the total town’s area) in order to establish five Israeli settlements:\n\nThe Shuafat refugee camp is the only Palestinian refugee camp located inside Jerusalem or any other Israeli-administered area. While its residents carry Jerusalem identity cards, which grants them the same privileges and rights as regular Israelis, the camp itself is largely serviced by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, even though 40 - 50% of the camp's population are not registered refugees. The Israeli West Bank barrier was partially constructed between the camp and the rest of Shuafat and Jerusalem. Some health services are provided by Israeli clinics in the camp. The Israeli presence is limited to checkpoints controlling entry and exit. According to Ir Amim, the camp suffers from high crime because Israeli Police rarely enter due to security concerns, while the Palestinian Civil Police Force does not operate in Israeli-administered municipalities. Unlike other UN-run refugee camps, residents of Shuafat camp pay taxes to the Israeli authorities.\n\nThe Shuafat Ridge next to the township was declared a 'green zone' to stop Palestinians in Shuafat from building there, until the opportunity arose to unfreeze its status as a green area and open it up for a new Jewish neighbourhood, as Teddy Kollek openly admitted.\n\nIn a survey conducted as part of the research for the book \"Negotiating Jerusalem\" (2000), it was reported that 59% of Israeli Jews supported redefining the borders of the city of Jerusalem so as to exclude Arab settlements such as Shuafat, in order to ensure a \"Jewish majority\" in Jerusalem.\n\nIn July 2001, the Israeli authorities destroyed 14 homes under construction in Shuafat on the orders of then mayor Ehud Olmert, who said the structures were built without permits. No one was yet living in them. The families acknowledged they do not own the land they built on, but believed they had permission to build there from Islamic Trust religious authorities and argue that obtaining permits to build legally is nearly impossible. Olmert said the houses were being constructed on public land in a \"green area\" and posed a security threat to the Jews of Pisgat Zeev. According to Isabel Kershner of the New York Times, Shuafat suffered from an absence of municipal planning, overcrowding, and potholed roads in 2007.\n\nAs prime minister, Ehud Olmert questioned whether the annexation of areas like Shuafat into the Jerusalem area was necessary. The Israeli initiative to transfer control of the area to the Palestinian National Authority led to a split in the community: A camp official favored being under Palestinian sovereignty, while the neighborhood's mukhtar rejected the plan, citing his residents' participation in Israeli elections as well as the danger of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel\n\nIn 2012, Sorbonne scholar Prof. Sylvaine Bulle cited the Shuafat refugee camp for its urban renewal dynamic, seeing it as an example of a creative adaptation to the fragmented space of the camps towards creating a bricolage city, with businesses relocating from east Jerusalem there and new investment in commercial projects.\n\nThree stations of the First 'Red' Line of the Jerusalem Light Rail are situated in Shuafat: Shuafat North, Shuafat Central and Shuafat South.\n\nThe neighbourhood’s Main Street, Shuafat Road, was previously part of route 60. In the 1990s a new route was built to the east of the neighbourhood, a dual carriageway with 3 lines in each direction, relieving traffic congestion along the road.\n\nIn 2014, the 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khdeir was kidnapped from near his home in Shuafat. He was then murdered by his kidnappers, who were Jewish extremists.\n\n\n"}

And then the same thing happened to the Englishman.\n\nThe Irishman saw the same castle and went to it, but when the lady gave him food, he stared about the castle and did not eat. When she asked, he said he could not eat without knowing who she was or where she came from, or how she came there. She told him she was an enchanted princess, and if a man stayed in a little room from ten until midnight for three nights running, she would be freed. Every night creatures came into the room and beat him, but the princess had a bottle that cured him every morning.\n\nShe went off and told him she would back in a coach and six. A little lad came, and when he went to wait for the princess, the lad stuck a pin in his coat, putting him to sleep. When the princess came, the lad told her he was asleep.

The eagle said that the daughter of the king of the Blue Mountains was about to marry, because she had agreed with her father that if the man who had saved her had not arrived in that time, she would marry. \n\nThe eagle said if they killed sixty cattle and the Irishman would throw quarter of one into its mouth every time it turned its head, it could carry him. So he and the old man hunted, and it flew off with him and the meat, but near the castle, the meat ran out, and the eagle threw him off. He landed in the bay and was able to get ashore. He gave a guinea to the king's henwife to bring the princess to him. She recognized the Irishman and married him instead of her new bridegroom.\n\n"}

In addition to this derogatory connotation, it may also serve as a term of respect and praise. \n\nThe phrase \"the Man is keeping me down\" is commonly used to describe oppression. The phrase \"stick it to the Man\" encourages resistance to authority, and essentially means \"fight back\" or \"resist\", either passively, openly or via sabotage.\n\nAs a phrase meaning \"the boss\" it dates from at least 1918.\n\nIn the Southern U.S. states, the phrase came to be applied to any man or any group in a position of authority, or to authority in the abstract. From about the 1950s the phrase was also an underworld code word for police, the warden of a prison or other law enforcement or penal authorities.\n\nThe use of this term was expanded to counterculture groups and their battles against authority, such as the Yippies, which, according to a May 19, 1969 article in \"U.S. News and World Report\", had the \"avowed aim ... to destroy 'The Man', their term for the present system of government\". The term eventually found its way into humorous usage, such as in a December 1979 motorcycle ad from the magazine \"Easyriders\" which featured the tagline, \"California residents: Add 6% sales tax for The Man.\"\n\nIn present day, the phrase has been popularized in commercials and cinema. It was featured particularly prominently as a recurring motif in the 2003 film \"School of Rock\". The film \"Undercover Brother\" had as a plot element a fictional organization headed by \"The Man\", an actual man in charge of oppressing African Americans.\n\nThe term has also been used as an approbation or form of praise. This may refer to the recipient's status as the leader or authority within a particular context, or it might be assumed to be a shortened form of a phrase like \"He is the man (who is in charge).\"\n\nIn more modern usage, it can be a superlative compliment (\"you da man!\") indicating that the subject is currently standing out amongst his peers even though they have no special designation or rank, such as a basketball player who is performing better than the other players on the court. It can also be used as a genuine compliment with an implied, slightly exaggerated or sarcastic tone, usually indicating that the person has indeed impressed the speaker but by doing something relatively trivial.\n\n\n"}

The popular print depicts caricatures of the British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger and the newly-crowned Emperor of France Napoleon, both wearing military uniforms, carving up a terrestrial globe into spheres of influence. It was published as a hand-coloured print and has been described by the National Portrait Gallery as \"probably Gillray's most famous print\" and by the British Library as \"one of Gillray’s most famous satires dealing with the Napoleonic wars\".\n\nGillray's print is a satire on the overtures made by Napoleon in January 1805 for a reconciliation with Britain during the War of the Third Coalition. The short-lived Peace of Amiens, a treaty between Britain and France, had ended in 1803, and Napoleon was threatening to invade Britain with his Grande Armée based at Boulogne. \n\nThe peace overtures came to naught: before the end of the year, a combined Franco-Spanish fleet would be decisively defeated by the Royal Navy at the Battle of Trafalgar, giving Britain unrivalled control of the seas, but Napoleon would establish a dominant position in Europe by first defeating an Austrian army through manoeuvre in the Ulm Campaign, and then winning a great victory over a combined Russian-Austrian army at the Battle of Austerlitz, ending the Third Coalition with the 1805 Peace of Pressburg.\n\nPitt and Napoleon are seated on opposite sides of a dining table, each using a carving knife and carving fork to cut pieces from a large spherical plum pudding bearing a map of the world, with the British Isles at the centre between them. The scene is replete with iconography referring to the contemporary political situation during the Napoleonic Wars.\nPitt, sitting to the left, is depicted tall and emaciated. He wears a red regimental uniform of the British Army - perhaps the Cinque Port Volunteer Corps that he had raised in Kent - with powdered hair in a queue, and a cocked tricorn hat. His fork resembles a three-pronged trident, referring to Britain's naval might, and he is carving a slice of sea to the west of the British Isles marked \"ocean\" and \"West Indies\". \n\nNapoleon, to the right, the \"little corporal\", is much smaller in height and stockier in build, with a prominent hooked nose. He wears the blue coat of the Imperial French Army, and his large fore-and-aft bicorn hat has an extravagant feather plume reminiscent of a French cock. His large knife resembles a military sword, and his two-pronged fork is embedded over a region marked \"Hanover\", home of the ruling British monarchs of the House of Hanover. He is cutting away a slice of land to the east of the British Isles marked \"Europe\", but his piece of land is much smaller than Pitt's portion of sea. \n\nThe pudding rests on a large gold platter at the centre of the table, which is covered by a white tablecloth. Pitt and Napoleon each have a smaller gold plate ready for their slices, Pitt's bearing the British Royal Coat of Arms and Napoleon's an imperial crown. The back of Pitt's chair is decorated with the image of lion carrying a cross of St George (sometimes a Union Flag) and Napoleon's has an Imperial eagle clutching a \"bonnet rouge\". \n\nThe printing plate measures and was typically impressed on paper measuring around . The print includes at top left the title \"The Plumb-pudding in danger; - or - State Epicures taking un Petit Souper\" the latter half in French, meaning 'state gourmets taking a little supper' - \"Epicures\" refers to the Greek hedonist philosopher Epicurus. Below this is a quotation attributed to William Windham in the \"Political Register\" newspaper, but actually taken from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\", Act 4, Scene 1, lines 153-4:\n\n<poem>\n\"The great Globe itself and all which it inherit\", is too small to satisfy such insatiable appetites.\n</poem>\n\nAn inscription also records that the print was designed and made by James Gillray, but it was not numbered or signed.\n\nThe print was published by Hannah Humphrey, of 27 St James's Street in London, on 26 February 1805, and was originally sold for about five shillings. There are examples in many museum and private collections. It has been described by Martin Rowson as \"probably the most famous political cartoon of all time … stolen over and over and over again by cartoonists ever since\".\n\n"}

It was located on the northern side of the city, not far from the city center. Measuring 20.7 meters long and 8 meters wide, it is the narrowest ancient synagogue uncovered in the Land of Israel. The bimah was located in the western wall, not oriented towards Jerusalem as in other synagogues of that era.\n\nThe Mishna describes Tzippori as having had 18 synagogues at the time of the funeral of Rabbi Judah haNasi in the late second century CE.\n\nThe mosaic floor of the ancient synagogue was discovered in 1993 by a crew building a parking lot at the edge of the national archaeological park of Tzippori. It is one of a handful of illustrated synagogue mosaics uncovered in Israel. Archaeologist Zeev Weiss, then a graduate student at the Hebrew University, and his teacher, archaeologist Ehud Netzer were called to the scene, and Weiss uncovered the floor and its environs.\n\nThe mosaic floor is divided into seven parts. Near the entrance is a scene showing the angels visiting Sarah. The next section shows the binding of Isaac. There is a large Zodiac with the names of the months written in Hebrew. Helios sits in the middle, in his sun chariot. Next, there is a row of three panels depicting the offerings in the Temple at Jerusalem, including the \"tamid\" sacrifice, the showbread and the basket of first fruits. Above this is a depiction of Aaron offering sacrifices in the Tabernacle. Above that is another row of three panels, a Torah Ark, depicted as a pedimented building, and an incense shovel representing the incense shovels used in the Temple, flanked by two panels each displaying the seven-branched Menorah from the Temple at Jerusalem surrounded by symbols of the Jewish holidays including the Lulav and Shofar. The top, or front of the building section of the floor, another row of three panels, shows two lions flanking a wreath, their paws resting on the head of an ox.\n\nThe largest panel or central sections of the mosaic is laid out as a large square containing a circle within a circle. This shows the Zodiac with Helios driving his chariot. As with the Hammat Tiberias Synagogue and the Beit Alfa Synagogue, the Zodiac panel at Tzippori features Spandrels depicting the four seasons.\n\nAn Aramaic mosaic inscription in honor of the donors reads: \"May he be remembered for good Yudan son of Isaac the Priest and Paragri his daughter, Amen, Amen.\"\n"}
{"id": "25593867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25593867", "title": "Volga Se Ganga", "text": "Volga Se Ganga\n\nVolga Se Ganga (, \"A journey from the Volga to the Ganges\") is a 1943 collection of 20 historical fiction short-stories by scholar and travel writer Rahul Sankrityayan. A true vagabond, Sankrityayan traveled to far lands like Russia, Korea, Japan, China and many others, where he mastered the languages of these lands and was an authority on cultural studies. \n\nThe stories collectively trace the migration of Aryans from the steppes of the Eurasia to regions around the Volga river; then their movements across the Hindukush and the Himalayas and the sub-Himalayan regions; and their spread to the Indo-Gangetic plains of the subcontinent of India. The book begins in 6000 BC and ends in 1942, the year when Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian nationalist leader called for the quit India movement.\n\nSanskritayan wrote his debut novel \"Jine Ke Liye\" in 1938. Meanwhile, 1941-42, he was inspired by the historical stories of Bhagawat Sharan Upadhyay. Later he wrote 20 short stories while imprisoned in Hazaribagh Central Jail for taking part in Indian independence movement. It was first published in 1943 and is considered one of the greatest Hindi book of modern Indian literature. \n\nIt has been translated into many languages including Marathi, Bengali, English, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Punjabi where he ran into several editions, besides foreign languages like Russian, Czech, Polish Chinese, and many more. This book is now considered a classic in history of Indian Literature. The first Bengali translation was published in 1954.\n\nVolga Se Ganga is about the history of Indo–European people who were later known as the Aryans. The 20 stories are woven over a span of 8000 years and a distance of about 10,000 km. \n\nThe first story, \"Nisha\", is about cavemen living in Caucasia (southern Russia) about 6000 BC. The society or its precursor at that time was matriarchal and so the story is named after the leader of the family 'Nisha'. Although all the 20 stories are independent, the sequence in which they are arranged nevertheless serves a very important purpose. Here one can find a gradual transformation from a matriarchal society (the first two stories) to a patriarchal one (the rest), a gradual change from freedom to slavery, from acceptance of slavery to its loathing and the likes. If one is to believe Sankrityayan, then an apprehension for technological advancement is nothing new. People were wary of the newly better armament which was fast replacing the older stone equipment (fourth story – \"Puruhoot\" (Tajikistan 2500 BC)). The same story tells how an arms race was started during that period and how southerners amassed great wealth at the expense of the northerners. \n\nThe sixth story, \"Angira\" (Taxila 1800 BC), is about a man who wants to save the Aryan race from losing its identity to other races by teaching about their true culture (precursor to Vedic Rishis). The eighth story (\"Pravahan\" (700 BC. Panchala, U.P.). is about the upper class manipulating religion for their own vested interests and conspiring to keep people in dark for at least 2000 years). One can see how easily and frequently the Indians, the mid easterners and the Greeks mingled with each other in the times of Chanakya and Alexander by reading the tenth story \"Nagdatt\", which is about a philosopher classmate of Chanakya who travels to Persia and Greece and learns how Athens fell to Macedonia. The eleventh story (\"Prabha\", 50 AD) is about the famous (also the first Indian) dramatist Aśvaghoṣa, who adopted the Greek art of drama into Indian culture in a very beautiful and authentic way, and his inspiration. \"Baba Noordeen\" (1300), the 15th story is about the rise of Sufism. The seventeenth story \"Rekha Bhagat\" (1800 is about the barbarous rule of the East India company and the anarchy it brought to parts of India. The last story (\"Sumer\", 1942) is about a man who goes on to fight the Japanese because he wants Soviet Russia to triumph, for this nation according to him is the only hope left for humanity.\n\nRahul Sankrityayan was greatly influenced by Marxist ideas. This influence can be easily felt in the last three stories. Mangal Singh (the protagonist in 18th story) personally knows Marx and Engels and is amazed how Marx knows so much about India. He explains to Anne, his beloved, how Science is indispensable to India but unfortunately the Indians put faith above it. He goes on to fight the Britishers in the 1857 uprising with a strict code of conduct.\n\nThe author (original name \"Kedarnath Pandey\") was so deeply influenced by Buddhism that he adopted it along with the name \"Rahul\" (The name of Gautam Buddha's son). This influence is also felt in his stories \"Bandhul Mall\" (490 BC, 9th story) and \"Prabha\". Also the dynamical view of life which is at the centre of Buddhist philosophy can be seen. One more characteristic feature that deserves mention here is the simplicity of language. There are no pointless linguistic decorations here. The author instantly gets to the point just like Voltaire with \"Candide\".\n\n"}
